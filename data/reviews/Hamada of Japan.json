{"text":"some friends came to town and were craving some sushi. we were walking on the strip close to flamingo and remembered there was this place here. so we decided to go here to eat since no one was really able to drive. this place was a bit hard to find, it was a little mini adventure. definitely worked up an appetite and finally found this place. sat down at the sushi bar. the place looks run down and the smell of the flamingo does not help. we ordered a lot and demolished everything, the bill is a bit on the high side, thinking its because its in a hotel on the strip maybe? other then these minor factors, the food seemed fresh and well made. definitely hit the spot for all of us."}
{"text":"With so many great choices in Vegas for Japanese food, Hamada of Japan definitely ends up near the bottom of that list IMO.  Hamada is located in the Flamingo hotel/casino on the strip.  I normally would have advised some out of towners where the better places to eat were, but they insisted on going somewhere in their hotel.  Fine, I'll go I figured.    The restaurant was nearly empty at 7:30 the night we went, and immediately red flags were going up.  We were seated quickly, but service was terrible.  We had to ask for our drink order to be taken after 10 minutes, and when some friends who normally don't eat sushi asked for some suggestions on the menu, we were told she would give us more time and be back in a few minutes.  How helpful of you.  After ordering the sushi/sashimi combo platter and a few rolls for the table, our food came out after not too long  The sushi was not the worst, but it's just OK, nothing special.  The bill came and I was shocked at the cost, nearly $50/person and we didn't order that much.  Normally this amount wouldn't be too surprising for good Japanese food, but seriously we didn't order that much.    When considering Hamada of Japan for you dining experience , take your time to choose a better place.  It shouldn't take you long."}
{"text":"Don't ignore the reviews:  this is some of the worst food at the most ridiculous prices you'll ever find.  In fact, it belongs on the restaurant equivalent of the list of movies so bad, you have to see them for their hilarity.  I ordered a New York strip with tempura and got back one of the worst cuts of meat I've ever been served.  Fatty, possibly old.  I mean, this \"steak\" was more suitable for your dog.  The tempura was unremarkable.  The salad was lettuce with some dressing.  Miso soup tasted like it had a non-fish base.  (Touch of beef broth?  I don't know).  All this for $36.    I'm still trying to decide which was worse, this, or Estiatorio Milos.  At least I could eat the food at Milos, even though it was mediocre and I had to arrange financing.  This stuff . . . this stuff was plain BAD.  The service was equally bad.  I wanted for a refill many times.  The ambiance was tomb-like.  Should have been a tip-off, but I wasn't thinking.  Oh, the regret . . .  Terrible, just . . . terrible.  Don't eat here.  Go to Chipotle or something.  You might at least walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"ATROCIOUS! I'm a lover of all that is sushi and so when I had one of my common sushi cravings and I just happened to pass by this place, I said to myself, \"why not.\" BIG MISTAKE. I was actually just going to get take out cause I didn't feel like eating there. So i went to the bar for take out orders and was not even greeted by the bartender with a menu for like 15 minutes! Then when he finally gave me a menu he has the nerve to tell me, \"i'm running a little bit late and i have to set up for tonight. do you mind just writing your order down for me?\" At first I thought that was so lame, but being a server myself It thought, \"yeah, why not. it happens. i'll give him some slack.\" So i specifically wrote down what I wanted and was still very nice to the bartender. He took the paper I wrote my order on and I had to wait. Then when my order finally came he got two things on my order wrong! He didn't even take off his mistake. I was more than willing to NOT take it with me. Duhhh! It wasn't what I wanted.  Whatever... this actually happened a few months ago and I can barely remember all the things that I was so mad about because I know that there were more things that I was quite upset about. I was really livid. I've never been this unhappy about take out in like.. forever!  Sushi wasn't even that great! Yuck! Overall, I would NOT recommend it. I would actually recommend against it. No wonder the place is so dead all the time. I drive by this place all the time and they never seem to have too much business."}
{"text":"Not your neighborhood Bennihana's. This is an awesome place to go if for anyone when craving for some teppan-yaki. They have selections that will satisfies anyone's budget. They can order from an entree of $13 all the way to +$50. The portions here were also generous. If you have group of people and everyone's on a different budget, this is one place that everyone will be happy. Just be prepare that the entire meal is around 2 hours if you're planning on watching shows or trying to get into the clubs.   You order whatever meat you want and the chef will put on a show for you and cook your meal in front of you. They do all the chopping and flipping right there on the hot grill. The BF and I shared the scallops and ordered an extra side of fried rice. It was accompanied with soup and salad. I like this place more than Bennihana's back home for one reason and its because of the sauce. Hamada will make the sauce for your seafood right on the grill. Something about the grilled scallops and a freshly made lemon sauce with sesame seeds tastes soo good. They also have other selection if you want sushi rolls to their bento combination meal sets. Like I said, they have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"When this angel and her hip family member who is in-the-Vegas-know want sinfully fresh sushi, this is where we go.    Late Friday and Saturday nights, try the bar, it's a good locale for you and your crew to hold court and court trouble.   Before he got his moniker, the Runaway Groom and I started our night of Vegas flash with some substantive and incredibly satisfying  fare.  We couldn't get enough of the  excellent rolls, fresh sashimi, great donburi and nice udon noodles. Check out the daily specials, because they're usually really good.     I have never been disappointed with the food nor the service. The Runaway Groom, however is another matter. He turned out to be a stale puffer, unlike the fresh, tasty and exotic fish featured this place.   Overall: Runaway from the Strip - do not walk  - to this place for excellent sushi, great service and interesting characters."}
{"text":"smelly inside of the store and bad food and empty restaurant.  I went there 2 days ago. Because I really like Teppanyaki. But I got a huge disappointment from this store. Just TOO EXPENSIVE ! I ordered the Hamada special which was the most expensive one from the menu. But the meat was hard chewy and the shrimp was small and not tasty.  The teppanyaki chef wasn't. that great either.  There was some Japanese tourists and they all looked like \" hate it \" . Do not go this place !"}
{"text":"We decided to go to this restaurant because our first 2 choice of sushi restaurants had a 2 hour waiting time and my children were getting irritated and hungry, so we decided to try  Hamada of Japan. From the look of the parking lot, there were only a few cars parked; whereas, the two restaurants next to it where full of cars. This should have been our first clue not to enter the restaurant. The staff were very nice and quick...which they should be because there were hardly anyone inside. The prices were way too expensive for the food they brought out. We ordered some appetizers: gyoza (not bad, but it seemed like it was store bought), and a sashimi appetizer (big mistake as it was way too expensive $13.95 for two tiny/thinly sliced of salmon, 3 tiny pieces of tuna, and 2 tiny pieces of white fish and it wasn't fresh at all). For the main course, we ordered the Love Boat ($54.95)...again, big mistake! The Love Boat included some California rolls (not bad), steak and chicken with some kind of sauce (NASTY), shrimp and vege tempura (not bad, could be better), siomai (tasted like store bought) and some eggrolls (tasted like store bought). Overall, we spent $84+. Never will we come back to this restaurant. Was very disappointed and the lack of customers on a Saturday night should have warned us not to come in. I gave this restaurant a 1 star because the waitress was very nice and prompt."}
{"text":"Leave it to me to go a Japanese restaurant first thing in Vegas.  Though it may be strange sushi happens to be my hangover food.  My hubby and I sat at the sushi bar, so I cannot review the habachi.  I was really surprised at how reasonable the sushi was, considering everything is triple the price in Vegas.  It was $7 for 2 nigiri and around $10 for the rolls.  The miso was really good (this is key hangover food).  Also, call me a snob but I appreciate the fact that the sushi chef and waitress were both Japanese and that I was able to have a conversation with them in Japanese.  No one knows sushi like the Japanese- seems like that would be obvious right?  But some places have not figured that out!    Overall great place to pop into to get a reasonable meal and some authentic sushi."}
{"text":"Went there after a 12 hours flight from Scandinavia via Chicago. Timewise for us it was in the middle of the night but we wanted something lite before we went to bed  We ordered several Maki rolls and some plates with Tempura.  Maki rolls was OK and there was nothing wrong with the Tempura either  Only problem was my daughter and my niece, they thought that one order or maki was 2 pieces like the nigiri. It was 8 pieces so there was quite a lot of maki rolls on the table when we left......  Service was good  Kirin bear sold out, it was my only disappointment."}
{"text":"The first thing that appealed to me was the genial japanese service.  We sat at the bar and sampled the chef's recommendation.  Had the yellow tail (good), tuna (good), urchin (so-so, not so fresh I think), and the Burning Man Roll.  The chef was excellent, very entertaining and offered good suggestions.  The wine list was limited, but adequate  The Ponzi sauce was very good  The also have a nice (and lively judging by the noise) teppen area.  This is a mainstream sushi place clustered in an area with a lot of restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there 7/15/07.   Great food, nice setup.  We were there on a sunday night, ~9PM, and initially had the place nearly to ourselves.  By ~10:30PM it had filled up a bit, and we could tell the place is a definite late-night hangout.    Went to the original, main location.   Ordered the sushi dinner (~$30), some dinner combo with a tuna tartar, shrimp tempura, terayaki chicken, a delicious rolled beef-with-scallions thing, and some salmon roll (~$34) and a spider roll (~$10).  sushi dinner was one each of salmon, tuna, whitefish, squid, egg, squid, surf clam, and a set of tuna rolls.  the dinner combo was HUGE, more than any one person could reasonably eat...   all the food was very good - on par with the better sushi restaurants I've had in Boston, NY, or Portland.  Spider roll was very good - well sized, and the crab flavor came through.  overall, we spent ~$100 on a very big (too much food) meal for two, at high quality (no liquor or beer).  Would definitely go again, but the sushi dinner and the combo and extra roll were about right for 3."}
{"text":"DON'T GO...  My husband and I took my daughter here for her 18th birthday (she was excited cause she'd never had teppanyaki) we were seated in the grill table area at our own table      (while there were two other grills going and VERY full of asians).    So there the three of us sat waiting to order...after about 5 minutes someone finally comes over and takes our drink order, as we sat and waited for our drinks we decided to just have sushi so we asked to be moved to the main dining room.  We sat in the MAIN dining room for at least 10 minutes with no acknowledgmemt whatsoever...so we decided to walk right next door to Bahama Breeze which ended up being AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is low lit and was kinda empty for Friday night dinner. They no longer offer all-you-can-eat sushi, since they are under new owner. They've sorta renamed as well, Kawa Hamada of JP i think. Service is pretty good, the staff is very courteous.   The food is okay. Nothing special. Pr icy considering all the food deals around Vegas. If you're looking for a bang-for-your-buck meal, head to a casino. Personally I would've been much happier using my money at a casino restaurant than here. Tempera udon was $11 and kitsune udon was $10. Certain rolled sushi was also expensive. Spider roll was $13, and I couldn't even see the soft shell crab in some of the pieces. I think the California roll was 7-10, i can't remember. Chicken teriyaki and tempera dinner was $20."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Smelled like sewer backed up, soy sauce container felt glued to counter ewwww.never had warm sushi before. Didn't know Philly roll served room temp.plus happy hour prices non existent.waiter didn't give 50%dis pocketed the $ instead. Calling corporate first thing in morning.Opened yelp account to post this. That's how bad this place is. If u wanna catch food poisoning go eat there."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this Hamada in years, but Friday night after Iron Man 2 was sold out at Town Square, I REALLY wanted some Miso soup to soothe my scrathy throat at 11pm. This place is close to my house and I knew it was open, so we stroll in and there is no one in there. Maybe 1 other table. Ambiance is nice, but I have to comment on our crazy ass, yet mildly entertaining waitress. So we sit down and she comes over decked out in Geisha attire straight out of Japan and I think of \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and those pictures flash into my head. I order the Oohlong tea, some sushi rolls, and my miso soup. I am not kidding when she does the \"miso soup dance\". I don't even know how to describe this, imagine a young asian woman with a black version of Anna Wintours hair cut do a chicken dance and sing a strange, vaguely English song, about miso soup. I look at Alex, and i'm like \" Can I please have some of whatever she is on?\". Kind of amazing. My tea was spectacular, I swear I would go back just for the hot tea (I love tea in general). The Miso soup was good, but the sushi was just mediocre at best. I have definitely had better. The Anna Wintour Geisha came back and was on top of us and very sweet, and even did another little dance about my tea. Tea, 2 sushi rolls, and miso soup came out to $17. Which is pretty cheap for Hamada. Then again, when you go to a sushi restaurant you expect to have good sushi, right? So I would go back to try a few of their other menu items but I don't know if i'd do sushi again.  The interior is beautiful, and the waitress gave me an experience to remember. So eh, 3 stars for the food & 5 for the service. So I think a 4 is fair until I go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Yesterday July 5th was the last day for Hamada of Japan. The entire restaurant chain is closed in Las Vegas, NV."}
{"text":"Our teppan chef was very friendly and personable. The food is reasonably priced/ competitive pricing with like restaurants. I recommend the chicken in a teriyaki. They recommended making reservations, but they were not very busy for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"the food was alright. i got udon and was really pleased that it was included with veggie tempura, too.  the place was pretty dead, aside from another couple at the sushi bar.  i don't know if this is because it's a sunday, but i guess i will go here as a last resort."}
{"text":"I would give a zero if I could. Was staying at flamingo and last night opted to try out Hamada. Omg. Bad idea. The place was pretty empty. We sat at a table with nice folks from New Mexico. We were the only four. Our waiter sucked. Forget silverware for salads and sushi appetizer. Asked three times. Also forgot drink orders. Maybe first night???  The cook was ok but not even Asian which was weird. Food was average at best. Same old Habachi tricks. Entertaining I guess. Our bill ended up being $225 for two people!!! Had habachi, steak and shrimp and steak and scallops. Three hot house sakis. Two miller lites (no Sapparro here) and a sushi appetizer. Unreal. Never again....and I really like the flamingo so it's kind sad."}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Las Vegas, I attempted to eat dinner at Hamada of Japan.  I had thought the menu looked good, so I decided to check it out.    Though the restaurant wasn't remotely crowded, I was put at the sushi bar (Even though I didn't want sushi) and forgotten about.  When I did get some attention from my waitress, she didn't seem to remember what beers the restaurant offered (Somehow I doubt that bottled Budweiser is the only beer they offer).    After fifteen minutes, I got the hint that my business wasn't important to them, and went somewhere else.  There are a lot of terrific Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas.  I didn't taste the food, so I don't know how Hamada compares, but I can tell you the service is poor.  In a city with so many great dining options, I don't think I need to go back."}
{"text":"We love Japanese food and figured we would try this since it was in our hotel. We ordered their two for meal and spent almost $90. Included in this meal was miso soup, salad and two choices of things off one special menu. We got some sushi rolls. It was just okay, nothing like Koi. The service was pretty good. The hot sake was the best part of the meal though."}
{"text":"Came for Teppanyaki  for a friends birthday on Friday. This place is small but nice. As another yelper mentioned this place is not cheap. Our chef was fun and entertaining but pricey. I guess for the strip it was average. They must have a full bar now as our friend had a vodka cran no problem. Nothing to woo about but good over all."}
{"text":"8.3.08: Scandalous! \"We be living in the world of scandalous, can you handle this can you imagine this?\"  All you Can Eat?!? That's what they said but is that what they did? I give stars for the miso soup and the rolls. It was pretty decent. A wide range of nigiri and rolls thats was satisfying.   BUT here's the thing. They give you one hour to eat and when they feel you're eating too much, well they make you wait for your next order until your time is up.   We kept asking the lady about our order and apparently I guess we were ordering too much and so on our \"last\" order we waited 20 minutes and when she came back with it she stated we can't order anymore because time has been up. WHAT? SCANDALOUS! 20 minutes for sushi? The funny thing about it was that was our smallest order that only had 3 orders of nigiri and 2 order of rolls. So sad..So sad..  $29 for 40 minutes..Not an hour!"}
{"text":"After driving around all night trying to find an acceptable sushi bar in Vegas. ( I generally don't like the thought of eating raw fish where there is no ocean.) A valet at Las Vegas Hilton turns us on to Hamada of Japan.  A free standing restaurant with a sushi bar, restaurant and tepan style dining room.  It was great. The perfect low-key atmosphere that is nearly impossible to find in Vegas, good quality sushi, a knowledgable sushi chef, excellent service and good company.  Obviously, because the only other customers were people just like us that wanted good sushi, good service and a more mellow dining experience than you would get at Sushi Roku or Social House. (Sorry, I know they are the hip fab places to be but, hip and fab for sushi is just amateurish.)  Anyway, I recommend this place if you are over 30 and okay with not having a half naked drunk girl eating california rolls next to you at the bar.  Sayonara!"}
{"text":"Omg. We went there yesterday 8 pm. Nobody was there. We were the only guests there.  Prices were unbelievable expensive. 44 $ scallops  88$ Filet mig. We ate teppanyaki. Chicken & steak were tastless.  Waitress was very friendly. Cook As well.  Would Never ever go there again.  Its old ugly dirty Restaurant.  Benihana is always an Experience. Hamada was a joke.  Please Close this restaurant."}
{"text":"OK, so I moved from Los Angeles to Minneapolis. I used to enjoy outstanding sushi at Sushi Go55 at 3rd and Alameda and very good ramen at any of the Santouka or Daikokuya locations. Hamada at the Flamingo is the epitome of mediocrity. But they have to work to attain that height.   $23 for 3 small pieces each of maguro and sake and 2 VERY thin slices of hamachi in the sashimi appetizer. Now to the abomination they call shoyu ramen. Tiny and very dry (even in the \"broth\") pork slices. The noodles were from a package of instant ramen and were overcooked. About 7 pieces of green onion. And incredibly weak and characterless \"broth\". I could taste some shoyu but it was like the Japanese version of a poor man's soup: luke warm water with some shoyu splashed in. I will say this though.  There was a shitlload of bamboo in the bowl.  Maybe that was the only ingredient the kitchen had.  Or maybe they couldn't reseal the container.  Hamada should be ashamed of itself to call this ramen. Save your pennies and go to Sushi Roku in the Forum Shops across the strip. Their hakata ramen was decent. Not great but decent.  And they have a much better selection of fish for sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"I can tell you right up front that the steak here was excellent, super tender and perfectly grilled and seasoned, but they lose a star for the tempura celery.  Who ever thought of such a thing?  \"What is this?\" I say to myself as I hold it delicately in front of myself with my chopsticks.  I turn it this way and that and then dip it into the sauce and pop it into my mouth and try to bite off a palatable chunk of it.  \"What the HELL is this?\" I gasp!  Tempura CELERY??  What the--\"  Minus one star for you!"}
{"text":"Can someone explain to me why this place looks pretty on the outside but lame in the inside?   Coming in to dine here is somewhat uncomfortable because the decor is outdated and the place looks like it's falling apart. Definitely not visually impressed by the interior.  Now, as for the food. It's OK. I've only had a chance to get have a taste of the appetizers, the soups and the sushi. All of the above is OK tasting. Nothing special. Nothing extraordinary. Fish/rice portions on the sushi were good; not too much rice and enough fish. Fish wasn't the freshest I've had but it's not bad either. Soups had a good portion of noodles and what not. The alcoholic beverage menu might need some help as I'm not very impressed by their somewhat slim selection of sakes.   Service is always really good and on point. The front of house staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The only time I experienced a wait and somewhat slow service was during valentines day one year.  Eh. The place doesn't really deserve anything more than 3/5 rating overall....I'm really not diggin' the somewhat expensive prices for a lame-o atmosphere and ok tasting food."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Be careful when making reservations you have to tell them you want the grill.  40 bucks for dragon roll...come on. 25 bucks for four pieces of sushi. Should have went to Mandalay Bay or Luxor for some fine seafood."}
{"text":"I went with a group of four for the hibachi.  It's just like Benihana.  I find the food expensive, but the it was entertaining watching food fly outside my kitchen.  I had the NY steak.  Personally, I prefer to have my steak in one piece."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Absolutely worthless.  This restaurant is so HAS BEEN they don't even maintain the neon sign above the entrance.    Menu that looks to be 5 years old has items x'd out with a Sharpie.  Yes, a magic marker.  No art on the wall indicative of owner change and new owners being under financed.  It's sad and depressing.  Likely not remodelled since the casino originally opened in 1990 this is a MUST PASS.  Doesn't even have old Vegas charm.  Just old, outdated and in need of closure."}
{"text":"It was in our hotel so we gave it a chance. The chef was super busy and didn't acknowledge us at the bar until I almost got up to leave...15 minutes. Come on just a little eye contact or a \"I'll be with you in a moment\" will work! The food was just fair to mediocore. I get 100% better sushi in San Diego and some of the places I call my cheapy sushi go to places. Rools were sloppy and very loose. I don't do cream cheese....not at all a Japanese staple. We got a roll that had creamcheese, but was told it didn't have any in it before he made it????? Wierd."}
{"text":"Good food! Great Sushi. 12$ for a roll. 80-100$ per person. Unless you get sushi. Great service all night."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!! If your looking for a fun and good tasting japanese place this is NOT the place. wasted so much money here. Went here expecting a nice dinner with the family and was very dissapointed!  The place was empty (so hard to find in the hotel) waaayyyy over priced sushi was gross and not fresh the chicken teriaki tasted like they thawed it out from the freezer the salmon was over cooked hair in the food miso soup and tempura was ok  Dont waste your time and money please!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant sits right next to the Rio Seafood Buffet (aka Village Seafood Buffet or VSB) so the competition for salmon sashimi is fierce.  On this past Saturday night, the line for the VSB was packed and surely the wait was over an hour.  So we saw this restaurant, which had the huge sign of \"All you can eat sushi for $29.99\" and we were delighted to give it a shot.  After we came in, we saw a little insert on the table detailing the \"rules\" of the all you can eat festivities.  I'm not kidding.... there are lots of rules to this all-you-can-eat offer.  Let me list a few of the rules: you must finish you current order before you can order more; you must finish all parts of the order, including rice; there is no sashimi, just sushi; this offer is good for only 1.5 hours; you have to eat the sushi upside down.  Ok I am joking about the last one.  The sushi is good, but I've had better.  The service was a little slow especially considering we only had 1.5 hours to do this.  In addition, you cannot order any uni (sea urchin), toro (fatty tuna) without paying extra for each order."}
{"text":"With Endless Sushi joints available in Vegas, Hamada has always been there for us. Last night I sat at the sushi bar of this Las Vegas institution. Even though the building has changed in the past five years, the sushi has not.   With it's central, yet off strip location its the easiest place to get a bite before a show or after a concert due to NOT having to walk through a casino. Hamada's welcoming and friendly staff remember I want hot tea and miso soup! Amazing! If possible arrive early to snag an order of the fantastic Sea Bass, it is unbelievable and goes quickly. Another signature is the \"burning man\" roll which is topped off with a blow torch! This Las Vegas staple is always open late and you'll be greeted with a sincere smile and cold sake. Weather you sit in the dining room with a large group at the teppen tables with strangers or at the sushi bar, you will get fantastic sushi. **don't forget to ask the hostess for the special gum that they give out. It is one of the best treats of the meal!!"}
{"text":"Well let me tell you, you are better not eating at all than going to this place. The service first of all was terrible. Waited over 45 min for them to take order from around the table. Salad came before the soup. The grill chef had a personality of the grill top it's self and I have seen a better show of reruns of Godzilla.   Where it gets better (i DO NOT THINK SO) was I made the vital mistake of ordering a order of yellow tail and salmon sushi. Man did I get sick the last two days so bad that I could not travel back home this past Wednesday as I was scheduled and barley made it yesterday.   Stay VERY FAR AWAY from this place and the chain."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a Japanese grill restaurant, you are in for a treat! A chef cooks all the food with great skill and agility right in front of you and your guests. They basically perform little cooking tricks which are sure to impress. Everything is very expensive but its a must for you and a group of friends if you have never been to one of these places."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a great deal - 50% off sushi. However, the portions were a little small. The Spider Roll was below par. It is still tough to beat at half price.  **found this review in a four year old phone's draft folder and decided to post."}
{"text":"Even though they stopped offering the all-you-can-eat special about a year ago, I still love Hamada.  The food is always good and the service is always friendly.  I always get the hamachi and magura nigiri when I am here and it does the trick.  However, this place doesn't compare to my favorite places in San Francisco.  It is solid Las Vegas fare without the glitz of being on The Strip.  This place has plenty of free parking in a private lot and they are open late.  After dinner, walk over to the Hard Rock Hotel and Caisno for a drink and win some money.  Or not."}
{"text":"Overall, disappointing.  While our huge umbrella drinks were good, the edamame was wilted, and they use long grain rice in their rolls and nigiri!  I'd never seen that before, but it affected the taste and made it hard to handle.  Selection of rolls is somewhat small, too."}
{"text":"Hamada's been a staple of Vegas dining for two decades.  Located on Flamingo and Paradise in Restaurant Row, their new building houses some of the best Japanese food and sushi in town.  You'll pay the price for the quality you get, but the experience is worth it.  The large, dark wood dining area makes the space intimate despite the fact that it's pretty big.  It's bar is hopping on the weekend with tourists and locals alike, coming in before or after the show for a drink and some sushi.  The hostesses are a delight, and the service has always been great.    I'm a fan of tempura.  A really, really big fan.  A nice big piece of sweet potato tempura can make my day, and I don't say that lightly.  \"So, Crystal, how's it going today?\" \"Oh, not too bad.  Well, you know, my dog died and I have shin splints and I got fired, but I went to Hamada and had this AMAZING sweet potato tempura, so life if great.\"  And Hamada, just like everything they do, does tempura right.  All of their selections have always hit the spot.  Their teriyaki is light and not too sweet, the rolls are big, fresh and satisfying, and although they have some of the freshest and most delicious sushi in town, their fish tank is still full of colorful friends to keep you company.  For locals in the vicinity, they have lunch specials that are out of this world!  For under $10, you can get a chicken teriyaki/shrimp and veggie tempura combo that's available for dine in and carry out.  Tatami rooms and Teppan grills are also available, making Hamada a great one stop place that does everything right."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go just about anywhere else for sushi.  Without exception, none of the fish tasted fresh and the miso soup, cucumber salad and spider roll were all lacking flavor. Even the celery and veggies in the roll were limp!  When we expressed our concern to our wait person he indicated that it was all fresh as they get it fresh EVERY TWO WEEKS.  Yikes!  We asked to speak to the manager and were told he wasn't working that day....which seem amazing for a Saturday evening in a tourist town.  We're locals and won't be back to Hamada again.  Check the Yelp reviews more carefully than we did this one time."}
{"text":"After the late shows, nothing stays open after 12 am on weekdays. I hear that in vegas nothing closes....yah right.  I think if you are looking for chains like P changs, etc. nearly everything close after 12 am on weekdays...except Hamada! We were dying for our favorite Bahama Breeze but no luck after midnight. Boohoo....Anyyelp, Hamada is open till 2 am i believe.  So in we came for some late night dinner.    Sat at bar, quick service with only one waitress taking care of everyone. She was so friendly and conscientious. The person at bar must have been a sous-chef or something.  His rolls are ok...not the best. But at 1 am we really don't care. We are too tired and hungry. Any rice is fine as long as i don't puke later.  Which we did not. This is our second trip so I know on regular dinner hours it can get busy and the taste is great!  Price for 2 of us with cocktails about $90. I know!! That is sushi for you.   One bad comment: I think place a bit too quite for me.  May need louder more upbeat music. Don't care to hear 80s Peabo Bryson \"Don't Know Much\" at almost 1 am. I felt like killing myself with that song and the quiet atmosphere. I thought it was happy hour at that time!"}
{"text":"We walked in around 1 pm on a Tuesday. Initially there was no staff to greet or seat us. There was another table already eating, but there was no staff to be seen. We should have taken this as a bad sign, but it was hot out so maybe we weren't thinking clearly! After getting seated it was apparent that there was only 1 waitress. This shouldn't be that big of a deal considering there were only 3 tables, (a total of 10 people) in the ENTIRE restaurant.   Luckily the food was ok. Nothing spectacular. They only had 3 bento boxes as options for their lunch menu. We continually had to flag her down and ask for refills on water. She was very nice when she did stop buy, but overall our bento box lunch ordeal took nearly 2 hours. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The place is nice and not too far from the strip. I enjoyed the appetizer you get with your meals.  The miso soup is awesome and the sushi kicks a**. The only thing I didnt like was the katsu bowl I ordered. The taste got really boring but other than that \"thumbs up\""}
{"text":"Was here with a rolls crowd and for that,  just fine. Good sized rolls for the price and tasty.  Leaves in the tea, waitresses in kimonos, & they speak Japanese.  Solid value for the Flamingo."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has become a place for gourmands and foodies in the last ten or fifteen years as there are some very good and very upscale restaurants there. Hamada seems to be part of this upscale tradition taking place.  The interior is spacious yet relaxed with low lite mood lighting and a surprisingly well stocked fish tank. The Sushi is very good just about anything you get at Hamada is usually good. I personally would recommend the Beef Negimaki. On a side note it is important to know that Hamada attempts to be as authentic as possible as occasionally the Japanese wait staff seem to have trouble  with English, some may find this to be unprofessional I found it oddly endearing."}
{"text":"Located in the Flamingo hotel, this place does not have good sushi.  The only people sitting at the bar were my wife and I and couple of guys who seemed like they were in Vegas for business.  Everyone else was enjoying the teppan.  Maybe that should have been the first indicator.    Mediocre sushi.  But expensive.  Yes everything in Vegas is expensive but its usually justifiable for some reason.  Here, not so much.  The salmon sashimi was good but not the tuna.  The caterpillar roll was ok.  It just wasn't all that fresh."}
{"text":"Great late night food.  Open till 2am.   Good sushi and very friendly staff.  My problem was I ordered chicken and my date ordered sushi.   My dinner came out 15 minutes before hers...    Good thing it wasn't our first date.   It was midnight and there was only 10 people eating......   Come on already ..  A little price but hey its VEGAS"}
{"text":"I've had better for less.  I am a fan of Teppan grills so that is where I chose to eat.  Good: Service. The cook. The other 2 folks at the table.  Not so good: salad was limp and the dressing was sweet. The piece of gristle in the meat, hard to cut it out with chop sticks. I thought is was a tad pricey. Very hard to find until you understand the map is telling you it is on another level.  Every thing else about the dinner was just OK.  For $70 with tip I would like more than just OK."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time.  We were actually on our way to a restaurant next door but we saw a sign for happy hour, where all sushi rolls are 50% off.    The restaurant was pretty empty, and we were seated immediately.  We sat at the sushi bar and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered 5 different rolls, and the sushi chef was pretty quick.  We had all the rolls out before we had finished the second one.  The rolls were a pretty typical size--not huge, but also not tiny like some other places I have been to.  Everything was great!  My husband is new to sushi so we stuck to the classics: spicy crab, rainbow roll, Alaskan roll.  But we also got a salmon skin roll, which was interesting, and the California Bomb (not included in the happy hour special), which was great.  The service was good, but I have to admit that the place was dead, so there was no reason to have bad service.  I will definitely be going back for more happy hour sushi, so we'll see how it goes."}
{"text":"Let me persuade you to eat here with 4 simple words: ALL YOU CAN EAT.  If you've read my other reviews, you'd know that I'm a glutton and I love all you can eat.  Hamada offers all you can eat on the menu for $29.  All you can eat includes your choice of rolls, nigiri, salad, soups, and a few very tasty entrees such as lemon chicken and mongolian beef.  The $29 price is pretty good considering the a-la-carte price of most of the nigiri was well above $5.    A quick heads up: never have I been served nigiri with a dollop of wasabi in between the fish and rice until I ate here.  I thought I had overloaded my soy sauce with wasabi because it was very strong with every serving, until I found the culprit.  If you don't like wasabi or prefer add it on yourself like me, ask for your nigiri without wasabi.  The service was ok and the craftmanship of the sushi was poor, but the flavors were pretty good.  This place is worth a visit in if you're at the Rio.  Try the super white tuna, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"It took us about 15 minutes to find this place in the Flaming-O. Despite the fact that I give this 3 stars, I am forever grateful we took the effort to find it. It's downstairs in the back near the valet entrance and nail salon or something like that. 4 of us ate at the teppan grill and had a roll or two. Rolls were good, not great. We were the only people in the entire place. It was a bit... odd. The decor is ok, but I felt like we were eating in a basement (I guess because we were.) Anyway, the food WAS extraordinary. Our chef, was head chef Tsutomu Molde. He was incredibly personable and very skilled at the teppan. The food WAS some of the best I had ever had at a teppan. Here's the deal though: Tsutomu has since left and opened his own restaurant (Musashi) just off the strip. All his skill, talent and personality are now gone from Hamada. We visit Musashi regularly now. He made the sauces from his own recipes and cooked like a master. Would I ever revisit this location? NO. I would go elsewhere. I cannot believe they are even open still, after he left. It's like a bar losing it's liquor license. Prices were way too high, even when the good chef was there."}
{"text":"A friend of mine hosted a dinner here during the G2E convention for his top clients and invited my Wife and I to join them.  When I heard it was at Hamada, I said \"We're In!\" and didn't even ask The Better Half what she thought about it....ha!  A group of 16 of us were seated at back to back grills in the Teppan side of the restaurant.  We placed our drink order (glass of Cabernet) with the Mamasan and then enjoyed the company and conversation for what seemed to be a very long time before we were given our menu.  Not sure if it was slow service or if time stood still while we all chatted.  If you've never been to Hamada, the Teppan side of the restaurant is identical to Benihana.  A chef grills your order in front of the group of people seated at the table and puts on a show with the food.  I decided to order the NY Steak & Chicken combo ($35).  The Better Half ordered the Two Lobster Tail dinner ($65).  The chef comes out and starts with the grilled Shrimp and Veggies.....then does the whole Volcano thing with the Onion.  Very entertaining, but predictable if you've been to Benihana.  I can't wait for someone to come up with a new act.  Then he gets into our entrees....I thought he did a great job cooking the Chicken and NY Steak.....both were cooked just right and had a lot of flavor.  I love dipping the Meats in the Sauces they provide for you.....although I have no clue what those Sauces are...ha!  We continued to eat and drink into the night and they made sure our glasses weren't empty.  A few of us did shots of Japanese Brandy and also had some Dessert, which was a Green Tea Ice Cream.  Overall, it was a fun and delicious dinner with friends and colleagues.  Will I return?  I prefer the other place, but will probably come back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Good food, embarrassing poor service, weird location.  Wheelchairs, scooters, and strollers need to take the elevator down and make it through a tunnel past the I.T. manager's door before finding this place as the rear of the casino.  So much fluff as Hamada's advertisements blare outside on the strip outside the Flamingo's doors.  Their front entrance is not friendly to less-than-agile.  They speak authentic Japanese, that was promising.  But the service was almost a violation of my civil rights.  If my Japanese mother had been with us, she would still be there the next morning chewing the staff out.    How many times would I need to repeat myself asking for *chopsticks* at a Japanese restaurant?  And water?  And green tea? Should I really beg to pay?  If you didn't want me there, you could have given me the check when I first walked though the door.    The food was good.  The sushi, teriyaki, and udon were all good.  If only I had the water or tea to wash it down with.  One server, one water/bus-woman who I guess is also the cook.  And this was at 9:00 PM.    The prices are high.  Not as high as other sushi places.  The menu selection is positive but I can't get over the service and I feel bad leaving the tip I did.  No customer should leave feeling he was forced to give an insulting amount.     Would I return?  Vegas is awfully a big place.  Don't bet on it."}
{"text":"When I first was told we were heading to Hamadas I was really  excited and anticpating some tasty eats. The food was Just ok unfortunately. I ordered the seafood meal and the lobster was overcooked, which was unfortunate because he sauteed it right in front of me and even I could see that it was on the grill too long.. Oh well...  Outside of the food the place was practically empty which was surprising because it was a Friday night... All in all the entire experience was just... OK I think i'll keep to Benihana if I want the group/japanese grille experience !"}
{"text":"I was not too impressed and would like to keep this short and to the point.   Like another Yelper stated...every roll tasted like a California Roll.    My other issues: -rice was warm.  When you have fresh fish in sushi, the rice should match.  Shouldn't it? -Sapporo was even warm.  Almost asked for ice  Gave the place 2 stars because the service was at least good.  Their Yellow Tail Shashimi was good though.  With Kazien around the corner, no need to come back here."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times over the years on various trips to Las Vegas. It is one of my favorite sushi places. I've never had bad service; the wait staff have always been very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  The food I've had has always been really fresh, using quality ingredients. They even had stuff flown in straight from Japan on special when I visited last.   The location inside the Flamingo is a bit hard to find, and their hours of operation are a bit lame given the city it's in, but worth a trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty when we went.  It was kind of cool, felt like I reserved the whole restaurant for me and my lady.    I am giving this place 2 stars because the food was OK.  But the place looks dirty and there was a roach crawling on my seat."}
{"text":"This was leg four of five in the quest for super late vegas sushi... they had a sign saying they served until 2am on a Monday night with the last seating at 1am... and they seemed to mean it.  We got there at 1:07 am and the doors were locked.  So yeah, this review is for the exterior of the building.  Anyway, we still had one name on our list... Kaizen, but no address... the adventure would continue..."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Ate from sushi menu. Sushi items very reasonable in price. Service was good."}
{"text":"An old college buddy who lives in Vegas took me here.  Service was a tag slow, and not completely pleasant.  Surprising because it was a Tue. night and it was only 1/2 full.  The Sushi and Sashimi are surprising good.  Very fresh.  The rolls are average.  I will go again!"}
{"text":"First I want to say I didn't come here by choice. It was my boyfriends fathers birthday so he chose where to eat. I haven't personally been to Hamada in forever but it was exactly how I recalled it. Big, slow, decent food, expensive.   Atmosphere: 4/5  You walk in this place and you feel like your in Japan. I liked the decor a lot of fake plants with a Japanese sand box in the middle (it was actually a rock box but I figured food + kids = dust everywhere). The lighting was very dark it helped disguised the fact they barely had anyone there. I was there about 6:30 prime dinner hours and that place was EMPTY.  Sashimi: 3/5 was delicious... fresh big chunks. They better be for the price! For an assorted boat of sashimi was $40 bucks. I basically inhaled it  Nigiri: 3/5 Great portions big fish and good amount of rice. I really liked their rice with the nigiri. It was a bit sweeter than most places.  Shrimp Tempura Boat: I'm not a fried food type of person but my boyfriends little brother loves Shrimp tempura. I can't give you a good opinion on shrimp tempura because I'm already bias on the friend part.   Teriyaki Chicken Entree: 0/5 I was so surprised how SIMPLE and HORRIBLE this dish was. I literally could've gotten better Teriyaki chicken from PANDA EXPRESS. The presentation was even horrible. A scoop of rice, teriyaki chicken, and edamame   Seaweed Salad: 0/5 What a rip off, this seaweed salad was mostly cucumber salad. They should call is cucumber salad with a dash of seaweed. What a joke..   Service: 5/5 Service was great, your waitresses are really nice and they get into character so well. Dressed in Japanese kimonos   Price: 0/5 Super expensive $$$$ for 3 1/2 people our bill came close to $300...and I was still hungry after."}
{"text":"this may have been the 1st all-you-can-eat sushi place where i got my money's worth.  (or i guess i should say \"my cousin's money's worth\" since she paid.)  not only because i ate a lot, but the prices for individual sushi was expensive!      for $25, you can sit for 2 hours and order as much sushi as you can eat.  or for $30, you can get sushi with tempura, teriyaki, etc. too.  watch out for the \"rules\", like no sharing, must eat all the rice, must finish all food before you can order more food, etc.  the watiers lurk around probably watching for rule breakers, but i was able to sneak off about 6 pieces of sushi to my cousins.  i usually shy away from all-you-can-eat sushi places, especially if it's a half teppan/half sushi place, but i also trust my cousin's japanese wife's taste.  the fish really was pretty fresh here.    there's a large menu of sushi, teriyaki, noodles, etc., so definitely something for everyone.  good place for groups.   the only negative is the service for the all-you-can-eat is SLOW!  we determined they do this on purpose to give you time to fill up, so you can't order as much sushi.  sneaky!"}
{"text":"This Hamada restaurant was here more than 10 years, to my suprise, it still looks great. The decor in the restaurant is a big plus. 2 huge fish tank on each side at the entrance and bamboo garden in the dinning area, very impressive. The price is a bit high, but you pay for what you have. The cooking method is very traditional, the tempura is the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Was here last week ordered 4 maki rolls, chicken terriyaki, and hibachi noodles.  The maki rolls were ok, not worth the price. They weren't rolled tightly so they fell apart as soon as they were dipped in soy sauce and there wasn't a wide selection. One of the rolls also tasted too fishy. The chicken was bland and rubbery. The best part about the meal were the noodles they were light and not too saucy.  Definitely would not go back,  it was just convenient because it was in our hotel."}
{"text":"I love teppanyaki. These guys rank up there with the tried and true Geisha on Sandhills.  Though the menu is not apples to apples considering the Geisha special which gives you shrimp, filet, chicken, and lobster is about $40. Filet and shrimp at Hamada is apx $58. My dad likes the place and we seem to go there when he comes to town."}
{"text":"I just wanted to yelp that a few years back I ate at the Hamada in the Luxor and enjoyed it very much, but I hear they are now gone from there. Fresh fish, tasty maki and cutesy service (in kimono).  However, the next time I am in Vegas, I plan to try this branch of Hamada."}
{"text":"So I'm in Vegas just for one night (mon) with my bro and mom, so we decided to have sushi. I yelped a couple spots walking distance and picked here, food was good not spectacular. The service is what was lacking would have been nice if this could be our new spot but its not."}
{"text":"I recently ate dinner at Hamada of Japan. The food itself is good, but I have to point out that the average tab here is NOT $25 per person, as the Flamingo's website states. If you order from the off of the teppan grill menu, entrees cost more like $80. Very deceiving!  Anyway, now that you know that, feel free to eat here. It's not a bad place to eat. I only ordered sushi, which was decent. Not the best I ever had, but OK.  Another thing to note is that this place doesn't have a full bar - beer and wine only. Annoying! WTF!?!? I thought this was Vegas! How can you not have a full bar?!?!  Service is OK. A little slow. The hibachi guys are really great and entertaining.   Honestly, I don't know if I would go here again. I feel like there are so many better restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Do not eat here....even for the 50% off happy hour special. It's not worth it. I just experienced the worst service and I swear every roll tasted like a California roll.   I understand the waitresses had to accommodate to some large parties that night but this restaurant is a large venue and should be well versed in multi-tasking and careering to various parties. I also noted the waitress would constantly check on the table of 2 next to us. She stopped by them 4 times and never came to check on us.   Here is our wait time broken down: We waited 3 minutes to be seated, 15 minutes to place our order and 25 minutes for the first wave of food to arrive.   We ordered 8 rolls total and our last 2 rolls didn't come till more than an hour after we ordered them. Were they one sushi chef down today or is this how it always is? Also I wished the waitress would have told us what rolls she delivered as opposed to running off and leaving us playing the guessing game.  I hate to be harsh on a restaurant that has potential but this just isn't cutting it for me...maybe I'm just accustomed to better service in California."}
{"text":"First thing coming here is that it's empty, got a bit worried but it's a Sunday night and not really a place for folks to go to after football sunday.  Service was pretty good and considering the restaurant was empty, it should be!  Another good thing is that we saw Japanese visitors come afterwards, whew... must be ok.  I ordered the two choice complete meal for $28 and it's a decent deal.  Had the fried scallops and tempura udon.  The scallops were quite large, fried crispy and perfectly, and came with katsu sauce.  The tempura was the same, nothing wrong here.  The udon was pretty good too, the soup was tasty with good fish stock base.  Recommended if you are in the mood for Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Only one star, not just because our appetizer was served after we had started on the main course. Only one star, not just because my ribeye, requested medium rare, was overcooked and lacked flavor. Only one star, not just because they had the gall to charge me $39 for the aforementioned overcooked and flavorless steak. Only one star, not just because my dining companion received her side after she was finished with her meal. Only one star, not just because the dinner caused my friend to become violently ill and spend the whole night purging. Only one star mainly because I haven't figured out how to assign zero stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"Seaweed salad, Dynamite appetizer, Sunomono, Spider roll, Yakitori, Coconut rice and a Sapporo. YIKES!!!    WAY. TOOO. DEELISH!! Super happy, Super full, Super gonna go back and eat here again. The chefs are really skilled at doing cool shows while cooking up your order, very entertaining. Each table has a personal chefy who whips up the food right in front of you while you wait, ours was friendly and made the dining experience fresh and fun. Arigato!  Will be back with a larger group next time :)"}
{"text":"Okay a simple review.  1. had the all you can eat sushi for dinner  2. sushi selection was mediocre  3. the fish to rice ratio was decnt  4. fish was decent in term of freshness  5. taste i give it a 5 out of 10  6. nothing home to write about except service was decent and miso soup was good  7. will i go back again no thanks, for an all you can eat special it was pricey and tasteless"}
{"text":"I have only came here once & was disappointed.   The prices were too expensive for the food.  The food tasted like I could have gone to a fast food place & the fast food probably would have even tasted BETTER than the food here at Hamadas.   The service was decent & attentive but I would never come back here again."}
{"text":"$14.99 Lunch All-You-Can-Eat Sushi!! Doesn't that sound like a good deal?!  Boy were we disappointed. Specially after reading all these positive dinner reviews. Heres the thing... you get a special lunch menu which only lets you choose from a handful of ordinary boring rolls and the standard assorted nigiri. Seeriously - all the allowable selections fit in a card the size of a lottery ticket. In addition, you get to chose from a variation of terayaki and stir fried dishes. The cooked dishes tasted like over-salted buffet left overs. The rolls were not memorable at all and the service was slow.   The decor  was nice."}
{"text":"I love sushi, but I think I may have broken it for everyone else by eating at Sugarfish in Los Angeles.  We came here for a dinner with some vendor folks, so the party got a bit large.  Hamada had OK sushi, but by no means great sushi.  Service was decent, the sushi selection was good, but the cuts of fish and the flavor and texture were only OK, not good or exceptional.  I enjoyed eating it but was aware the whole time that I've had better.  I don't think I'll be coming back here on my own."}
{"text":"I love to bring groups of 6+ to this place.  How can it go wrong?  Good friends, alcohol, meat and a hibachi grill = fantastic way to kick off an evening."}
{"text":"Used to be great, last two times we went, sushi has been tiny pieces and not that great. Anyone know of a good sushi place in Vegas"}
{"text":"The service was very attentive and fast, but not rushed. I was struck at how the decor of this restauant is like a early 80's throwback of a Japanese or Hawaiian restaurant, but in a good way. The place is massive but feels cozy due to the darkness of the decor and focused lighting.  I had sushi at the bar and the restaurant was rather quiet.  Unfortunately I had to put up with a loud couple in bad suits and bad hair (I could've sworn I was transported back to 1982) talking about their bankruptcy court hearing in the morning and the gentleman whining about his kids and ex-wife.  Their rudeness (fueled by a few Sapporos) even raised the eyebrows of the sushi chef and other diners, which we all enjoyed giving them dirty looks which they didn't even notice.  The sushi was good but not great, but served quickly and the cuts of fish were generous.  Strangely the amount of rice was rather miniscule in comparison.  The final tab with a large bottle of sake was extremely reasonable. This is a good place for sushi at an excellent price."}
{"text":"Never again.  Late night, post-show, 10pm or so. Fond memories (of long ago) and a yen for some fresh, lighter fare led us to Hamada for a mix of sushi, teppan grilling, and old standards (a strong desire for fried rice was shared by my companion).  Walk in. Reverie broken.   The teppan grills were turned off. We asked for a quiet spot for two and were instead tucked in next to a large group and another small group of 3 or 4. No sushi and no fried rice.  What the...?  Short and bitter:  The broiled mackerel I ordered wasn't broiled as much as it was destroyed by some sort of hot, firey mass of anti-food matter. It was flavorless, dry, and not even suitable for hockey season.  The grilled teriyaki steak he ordered was OK, doused in sauce, but ultimately cooked OK, if slightly overdone. The sauce was meant to hide the fact that it was not, in fact, grilled. It looked steamed, if that, and had a bit of an odd texture.  No fried rice because the grills were turned off... so they can't cook some up in the kitchen with the rest of the hot food? No sushi, either. Because why... the grills were off?   Question: If you can't serve the menu, and you don't offer a special, late night menu, and if you can't cook properly that which you do offer... why stay open?  The sake was low-grade, bitter. We drank it to mask the taste (or lack thereof) of the food. The service was nonexistent, the food horrendous, and the atmosphere was dingy, left-behind, and a bit sad.  My fish was supposed to be an appetizer. His steak was an entree. We shared the sake. For $50?! Seriously?  Much like the rest of my Flamingo experience ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/flamingo-las-vegas-las-vegas-2#hrid:Y3gKnYNn1lYCCR8FpSoT_w ), if I could give 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"My previous visits here were a few years back.  It was always busy then, but this time it was dead.  I was there on a Saturday and it was pretty empty, maybe 20 people in the whole restaurant.  I suspect it will not be around too much longer if that is a regular weekend. Otherwise, the food and service was good.  I had sushi, it may not have been the freshest, but it was still good.  I hope it gets busier and sticks around."}
{"text":"Ehhh, passable sushi and Japanese food that's been watered down in quality and taste for the American tourist crowd.  This tastes like previously frozen sushi found in a restaurant in the midwest, with sushi standards depressed because the clientelle just doesn't know the difference.  I ordered some sushi (which is dinner only) and donburi, and both tasted like something I would get in the mall.  I just expected something better I guess, but they're located in Flamingo Hotel so I should have expected it.  I wouldn't come back, there's so many more better places in the area."}
{"text":"I first ate at Hamada's branch at the Luxor - now closed. I then tried the branch at the Hawaiian Marketplace - now closed. Here's hoping I don't cause the main location to close as well!  Hamada is a solid, middle of the road establishment. The sushi is good, but its real strength is in the many interesting appetizers and smaller courses, such as: *  shishamo: broiled whole smelt, full of roe. Eat each small fish whole, head and all. It's a lot better than it sounds. *  hamachi kama: grilled yellowtail cheek.  There's only a little bit of edible flesh, but what flesh it is - very rich and flavorful.  Highly recommended. *  ankimo: monkfish liver pate. It sounds weird and looks weird, but is very good: solid yet creamy and very rich. I had this a while ago, and don't know if it's still available. Ask for it if you don't see it on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday.  Never been to a teppan place before but definitely am not a n00b when it comes to asianish-teriyaki-ish sushi-ish restaurants.  I ordered the New York Steak and Scallops combo that came with a dessert at the end.  From the beginning the waitress (who were dressed in kimonos, almost geisha-y) were very friendly.  My meal came with shrimp, veggie medley (onions, zucchini, and mushrooms) and white steamed rice.  I went with a group of 5 and watched in amazement as the (hot) cook worked his magic right in front of our eyes.  I learned a new way to crack an egg, cook some onions, and add a little flare.  The food itself was amazing.  My steak was cooked perfectly ( I asked for it medium rare), the scallops were succulent and the veggies were good.  They surprised me at the end with a little birthday treat.  My green tea ice cream was in the peel of an orange, with the fruit on the side and a serving of honeydew.  It was a nice ending to a fantastic meal.  + = friendly staff, dinner and a show!, great food, fun environment  - = this type of food is always expensive"}
{"text":"The fact that we could barely find it in the \"FLAMINGO\" should have set of my sensors. \"eh\" pretty much sums it up. There were a couple pieces that I wouldn't even try. There was a browning ting...i swear! My BF said it was good, esp. the fresh toro. but there are somethings that I'm convinced I'll catch worms from, and funky sushi is high up there.   Standard rolls, don't expect things like the wabo-kaboom or whatever. Its safe, regular stuff. The tofu appetizer is worth a skip. its a deep fried floating in \"broth\" dish. as in..poke it a few times with the chopsticks and watch the oil float on top..ew.   Just have a LOT of hot sake and beer and it will all be good."}
