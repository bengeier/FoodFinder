{"text":"Good food. Nice servers. Small menu. Clean. Desserts looked great. Steak and cheese sandwich was great! Will be back to try a special and the desserts."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was not anything to rave about. Owner was not professional nor a pleasure to interact with. What a shame, when you rely on a small community for your business you think you would conduct yourself in a more appropriate manner!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit. I'm afraid to try any business here because they're here one day and gone the next.

We sat down and we're greeted immediately. She took our drink orders. Then after she provided us our drinks and took our orders. I asked for the western omelette with no onions. She said it's mixed together. (Other places have made it without onions).

She brought our food to us. I had ordered a pancake with my breakfast sandwich. She looked at me as if I were making it up. Then said she'd put the order in. She then. Appologized afterwards.

Overall small place, small menu(smart) nice people, service can improve slightly, food was fine. I will try lunch next time."}
{"text":"Went back for out second visit.  Let me tell you, the smells were awesome.

My nose was immediately hit with the smell of stuffed peppers.  That was the special soup of the day.  However, I zoned in on the chicken and dumplings.

My son ordered his favorite steak and cheese, my other son Country fried steak!  

My chicken & dumplings was HUGE!  Omg it was delish and I am suffering now for eating most all of it.  I am stuffed!

Yay they had Lemonade!  My son said, \"and it's the good kind\".  

My only complaint, I ate too much!

Not sure what Sarah's problem was, but if your looking for \"Country\" or home cooking, this is the place.  

Sarah, you should reach out to the owner.  Perhaps tell her your concern.  She seems rather friendly.

My kids loved their food.  It's very kid friendly."}
