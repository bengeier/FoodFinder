{"text":"Although there are many options at the food court, I've been getting my lunch at this place for many years but recently they are making me uncomfortable by asking why I'm asking for take out. So I told her I wanted a lid because I cannot finish the entire meal.  I'm not getting a soup that comes with the meal since I've asked for take out which is totally fine with me, I don't want the soup anyways.  I really dislike her attitude.  If you want to charge for the lid and cutlery,, then just say so."}
{"text":"Instant noodles with steak/eggs ($8.50) came with hk milk tea Standard breakfast food, just had a craving so decided to order it. The place is nicely decorated with a large selection of food. Quality of food is pretty standard, met my expectations but it weren't set too high to begin with. Milk tea is pretty fresh tasting, recommend you add a bit more sugar though - it's on the blander tasting side.  That aside the instant noodles had good boyancy and seemed freshly made. They forgot to mix my MSG powder so first couple bites didn't have much flavour. Just took a bite with all the powder inside which was extremely salty. Bit disappointing that they didn't just mix it for me ahead of time. Steak and eggs was average as well. Great for being available but the food is only alright but for the price it's definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"A long-time tenant at the First Markham Place food court, featuring Hong Kong style snacks, meals, and drinks. Whether you're grabbing a bite as you walk around the mall or looking for a quick meal, this can be your stop on a budget.  The menu features all your HK classics - baked rice and pastas, sandwiches, instant noodles, chicken wings, deep fried toast, and a personal favourite - bubble waffles! Combos and daily specials are available all day long - featuring the addition of a small drink (usually either coffee or HK-style milk tea) while some will include a side of soup (usually the more dinner-style dishes).  On my most recent visit we ordered the chicken with coconut sauce baked rice (???????), combo B8 satay beef bun and ham omelette (??????????, and K11 super thick HK style French toast (?????) with peanut butter added. The baked rice came with soup and drink (not advertised) and the other two came with a drink. You can upgrade your drink from hot to cold, and from coffee or tea to other options - you'll find everything from classic HK cafe options like Horlicks and Ovaltine to bubble teas.  The baked rice was a good portion - great bang for buck. The coconut sauce was flavourful and not too heavy, and the chicken fit well and was in decent quantity. The satay beef bun was smaller than expected - there was a thin single lettuce slice in the bun that didn't add much, and the bun had a beef dip kind of sensation. Fortunately, the bun was well toasted and not overly crunchy or chewy. The omelette is as the name suggests - simple sliced ham in a rolled up omelette. The portion was smaller but you get some variety, making for a decent lunch meal if you're looking for a lower-carb alternative. Finally the French toast - remember, HK style French toast is deep fried - so it's definitely not one of healthier options! A good portion size, accompanied by just the right amount of syrup, Magic Fusion makes a great HK style French toast! If you're looking for a quick snack and changing it up from the go-to bubble waffle, I recommend their French toast - a classic at an affordable price, with a drink to go with it! Not something to carry around, but there's plenty of seating available especially if you're on an off-peak time.   Overall, nothing super fancy - just your HK cafe classics and a few items with a modern/North American twist. Good bang for your buck if you're in the area, especially if you're already in First Markham Place!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best egg waffle in this city!! Unfortunately, this place is way underrated. Definitely check it out if you want the most authentic Hong Kong style egg waffles!"}
{"text":"Baked rice and spaghetti dishes here are large but not as tasty as I had hoped. Bbt isnt that good either. Tapioca tasted overcooked. Way too much rice instead of meat and sauce substance on the baked rice. You could probably get more value and taste at the other HK baked style stalls at the same foodcourt. May come back to try their egg waffles though."}
{"text":"I received the wrong order...asked for the pork chop with tomato sauce baked rice but was given some sweet and sour chicken with rice. Not sure if there was a price difference.  The food isn't bad but really not what I was expecting to get or what I wanted to eat.  The 5 pieces of chicken is tender but the sauce is way too sweet, mixed with a lot of fried potato, some onion and green pepper.   I also added a taro bubble tea for $1.25. The sign stated \"add\" so I thought I would still get the drink that's supposed to come with the combo (coffee or hk milk tea) but I think it's just a grammatical error because I only got the bland taro bbt.   I will give this place another try without their bbt...and will make sure to double check my takeout before leaving."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place to eat whenever I am in First Markham Place, as all the other food places offer big meals, and I believe this is one of the few ones wherein I could get a simple small snack.  I always try to get different small snacks (sandwiches) everytime, and I must say the portion sizes are much smaller than other HK style places, and the taste is bland most of the time, therefore 2 stars for the food.  Service is friendly, so I am giving them an additional star for that.  Over-all pretty average HK style place for a small food court, I just really wish their portion sizes are more consistent with other HK style places in the area."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. The quality and quantity are both very good. I ordered Ox Tongue in Cream Sauce with Spaghetti and Baked Pork Chop in tomato sauce on rice (HK Style). I usually don't write review on restaurant but i have to do it this time as the place is real good and see that the chef really put their heart in their cooking. One improvement they can make is that the spaghetti is a little bit over cooked and it turns out to be too soft. I will buy from this place more often now. Recently, it is quite hard to find a quality and cleaned HK Style restaurant (that charged a reasonable price) in Markham. This one is a top pick!!"}
{"text":"Just like Calvin I am also surprised that there are so few reviews for this place. I use to come here on a regular basis when I worked close to the area. I would almost always get the meat sauce spaghetti and a cold milk tea which comes to about $8-9 after tax. You can also add chicken steak to it for about $2-3 more. I really like the sauce. Its really thick and full of flavor and has some cheese to top it off. I'm always super full after finishing this meal and when the chicken is added its just over. No need to go back to work if you finish the chicken as well. I'm just ready to pass out  after a meal like that. The milk tea is just like you would get at any other Hong Kong Style eatery's. Smooth, sweet and cold - perfect for a hot summers day. But I still get it cold even during winter. Its really addicting."}
{"text":"No review for this place even after 15+ years of existence? Wow. Though this place did change its name to Magic Fusion Cuisine several years back after undergoing an expansion.  For the prices offered in this place, I can't argue much. It's your typical fast food place serving typical fast food with typical fast food quality at typical fast food prices. They do have daily specials everyday which are worth it sometimes.  Drinks are hit or miss, depending on the quality of the tea (in the case of milk tea or iced lemon tea). I tend to have better luck with the drinks at night than during the day though.  For the FMP food court, this is overall one of the places I regularly visit simply because it's usually open the latest and the low prices they offer. Pho Lings, Yan's Cook, and Tasty House are some of the others I also recommend."}
{"text":"Just purchased a HK egg waffle from here. I remember purchasing one in the past that was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy in the inside. This time I feel like they rushed my egg waffle because it's not that crispy on the outside and the inside was \"just cooked\". Perhaps I caught them at a bad time as they were busy scooping fish balls for other customers and getting their orders on check. Also they charged me tax on a $3 waffle. Usually most Chinese places would charge you $3 for 1 or $5 for 2 orders no tax."}
{"text":"This is a great Hong Kong Style food court restaurant. Items are reasonably priced, but don't compromise in quality and taste."}
{"text":"I have to say I don't recommend this place, not at all. The store is nice and well decorated, but does it matter since you are gonna seat in food court anyway? I ordered Thai style grill chicken with rice, and I was disappointed, strongly. I was expecting dry chicken since it says grill, maybe a bit of sauce on the side or on the chicken, but the whole dish was extremely overpowered with spicy sweet sauce that you cannot feel or taste anything else. A bowl, seems like soup at first glance, came with the dish and when I tried, it tasted like gravy. I don't understand the purpose of serving such a dish. Price is important, since this food court is packed with many stores, reasonable prices. Magic fusion cuisine is expensive, definitely not worth it. The only good thing that earned two stars from me was the HK milk tea, pretty standard, nothing special, but hey, I don't want to give one star, too harsh, but two stars is quite generous, should have been one and a half."}
{"text":"This is in the food court of First Markham Place so there's lots of parking and seats. This tasted pretty generic and plain but was filling. The fried pork chop had a very light breading which I appreciated and it wasn't too oily. Kind of hard to screw up the rice, egg, and veggies, so those were ok. My biggest issue with this was the tomato sauce which had a really weird taste to it. It almost tasted like canned tomato sauce with a touch of cream to make it less tangy. Came with cold soya milk. With so many options in the court, I'd be hard pressed to return anytime soon.  Rating: 2 bootleg DVDs out of 5"}
{"text":"Bacon cheese with instant noodle included a hot drink $7.75  It usually comes with raw egg but I requested for a fried egg.  Very tasty if u like instant noodle."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing for their Hong Kong egg waffles because they're the best. They're soft and fluffy on the inside and, slightly crisp but not too hard on the outside. I can't speak much about their other menu items but if it's as good as these egg waffles, it can't be half bad."}
