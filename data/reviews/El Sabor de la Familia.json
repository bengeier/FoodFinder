{"text":"This is good (but not great) Mexican food at a good price. I had a beef chimi and my wife had the tacos. Both were good! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had eaten their food a couple of times and I stopped by one day on my way home to get some take-out for us.  I wasn't thrilled about the food in the past.  They really water/milk down their guacamole, sour cream, and their refried beans might as well be called soup.  I could rant for hours on why guacamole shouldn't have the consistency of milk but I won't.  The restaurant was filthy, tables were sticky, trash on the tables and floor.  The food did arrive quickly and I headed home.    At home we both discover neither one of our dishes had guacamole (which the description said they should) and the sour cream isn't cream-like... it's more like half & half.   Ew.  We are both hungry though and begin knowing full well the food looks gross.  We eat our meals and my Carne Asade doesn't really taste like Carne Asade, it tastes like it was starting to turn and a bit Lamb-y, plus it is super dry.  Oh yeah and it's about 2 shades away from being black.    And then I get a piece that tastes like Pine Sol.  Blech!  I spit it out and threw out the rest of my dish.    Never, ever, going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. A family ran restaurant with great prices and really good food. Try the super burrito which is just over $5.00. They also have menudo every day they serve it with homemade corn tortillas made when when you order. Better then Filibertos and usally cheaper and not a chain!"}
{"text":"I wish they spoke better English, so that it would be much easier to call and place orders and make sure they understand what people are saying. Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"The smoothest refried beans, perfectly flavorful short-grained mexican rice, fair prices, and tasty hot sauce/salsas (red and green). If the meat (carne asada and pork) on the tacos was a bit better, this would definitely be 4 stars, but it's more like 3.5 stars due to the meat being a bit tough and dry, and needing a little more flavor. Overall, I enjoyed it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"love this place. they have good prices for the amount of food you get. so friendly and yummy. love the super burrito! soups are available everyday even menudo."}
{"text":"Ordered the caldo de res (beef soup) and it was good! Comes with the choice of flour tortilla, corn tortilla or bread. Only little thing was that the rice was saltier than I personally like but still good. Ate everything!  Also, on the table there is crush red pepper, oregano and dried red chilies, so that was nice."}
{"text":"The rice and beans were delicious and taste just like home cooked food. On the other hand the carne Asada burrito wasn't as good as one from a regular filibertos. It tasted a little healthier and less greasy. Which that is what gives the taste to a Mexican burrito!!!"}
{"text":"No good burnt tacos and burnt nachos old the oil is old as hell no meat in the tacos no flavor  and just unfriendy people wont ever go back"}
{"text":"Ive been craving enchaladas and I was in the area with the fam.  I looked at yelp real quick and said ok lets try it.  La Familia was quiet and the kitchen looks like grandma's house.  I ordered  #5 with beef,  3 enchaladas with rice and beans.  I love,  love homeade mexican rice and Familias was ok,  better than any Filibertos or Julibertos.  The beans were not good,  they were watery, but my red beef enchaladas were on point.  The sauce was definitely homemade.  I would definitely give La Familia another try."}
{"text":"Not saying this is the best Mexican food I've ever had but it is very good, especially for the price. I would say far better in price and food quality than you would get going to places like Filiberto's or Julioberto's. Consistently tasty, and the ladies that work there are always kind. I especially love their sopes, it's around 8 dollars after tax for 4 sopes, rice and beans.  Definitely my favorite work lunch grub out spot."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite to eat and saw the dreaded mcdonalds drive thru, so I thought ok whatever. But then I saw this Mexican place so I decided to try it. And I'm glad I did, I got a ham breakfast buritto and it was seriously the beat one I've ever ate. It just tasted so fresh and authentic. The green sauce they have is great also. I've been back here a few more times and had the Carne Asada Nachos and Wow they were delicious. The 2 ladies I see here are very nice and the place isn't that expensive. I recommend trying this place. I've only had the breakfast burritos and nachos. But I'm sure everything they have will taste great."}
{"text":"I love this place... If I want a home cooked Mexican meal... I come here. The pricing is reasonable too."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood Mexican hole in the wall. Customers come here for the menudo. I love their tacos al pastor, soft or crunchy. The salsa verde is salty and tangy, cutting through the meaty flavors. Their queso fresco sprinkles have a robust flavor that brightens the good. We also got the rolled taqueria which were okay. The meat to tortilla ratio wasn't as tasty. I guess it is back to the tacos."}
{"text":"The menudo was  over cooked and it had no flavor it was to greasy and too salty no spice to it .  I had menudo plenty times I know how it is supposed to taste , also the other soups are too greasy and the salsas could be better for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to! The food is always good and the price is great for what you get! Love the chimichanga, menudo, and the green sauce is great!"}
{"text":"Seems to be a family owned establishment.  I've been here a few times and the service is always friendly.  I order the bean burrito and it's very good.  The beans have a good flavor and the tortillas are good as well.  I would definitely go back to try a breakfast burrito or something different.  The salsa was fresh and different than most other burrito shops which was nice.    It's reasonably priced.  The decor and such could use a little updating.  The tables and chairs are a little janky but this isn't a big deal to me with dive establishments.    I will go back."}
{"text":"Got ceviche and was warm and the shrimp has not been cleaned, asked the gentleman working if I could replace it for something else and he shouted \"WHY!\" I had told him that it was warm and wasn't very good and again asked if he could replace for something else and he said \"I can't reuse that, so no\" I asked if someone doesn't like the food they don't replace it with something different and he said \"NO\". After that I threw my napkins away and walked straight out, never eating at this place again."}
{"text":"Acabo de ir a comer a este lugar  las mesas están asquerosas todas pegajosas de mugre la plancha donde cocinan esta asquerosa la pared desde que entras se ve asquerosa de grasa la comida muy mala pedí chile relleno con arroz y frijoles,el chile relleno sabia agrio apuntó de descomponerse,el arroz estaba crudo,los frijoles agrios  mi compañero pidió gorditas  están llenas pero de lechuga y tomate y una mínima cantidad de carne,no recomiendo este lugar  apersonas que sepan de calidad en la comida"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here so many times I have lost count. They are definitely the best in The Valley for homemade albóndigas. If you haven't been here it is must. I've made homemade before and it's a lot of work. Now I just stop by and eat their delicious soups. Very generous servings as well."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  So far my hubby and I have tried the tacos, shrimp burrito,  the enchiladas  (my personal favorite ). Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food tastes great! Real authentic Mexican food. The carne asada gorditas and sopes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is a little bland. I ordered menudo and had to add lime and extra chili because the original juice was a little sweet. I also got an horchata, that was good. Not the best I've ever had but it was still pretty good. I'd say this place is just ok, which is disappointing because the pictures of the food make it look so good! :("}
{"text":"This food here is horrible, I spent over $30 for three meals. I got a basic 2 crunchy tacos, beans and rice meal. The rice was dry and flavorless, the beans could have been eaten with a straw. The tacos im sure started off crunchy but they were swimming in a combination of water and super runny sour cream so were soggy and cold. My mom got the albondigas soup which consisted of the broth, half a carrot, half a potato and one and a half meatball, unfortunately it tasted like a cleaning solution. Lastly my dad got a taco salad which they gave the wrong item because they dont speak english well but once they got it semi correct it was all lettuce with those watery beans  and beef again that had half inch of juice that everything was floating in which made the bottom of the shell soggy and cold. Needless to say we will not be going back and recommend others stay away as well!"}
{"text":"I usually come here 2 to 4 times a week every time I spend over 25$ the chilaquiles are good and the meat soup .   Today I went to get some menudo it was terrible over cooked weak no flavor but it was salty .          I always have to ask for key limes because they never want to give them out they only give you the yellow lime (lemon)  it wasn't just me but my partner didn't like it rather we were trying to eat it but it was so oily nasty I never had a worst menudo in my life so disappointed. I went and ask the lady if she could exchange me for a chilaquiles plate and she said no . I try to convince her and she said no they can't do that for me I said I'm a frequent client she didn't do it .  Not going to eat at this place anymore no loyalty to good costumers."}
{"text":"They put some effort into making some dishes look good! Items like quesadillas, on the other hand, are plain, and made with just the essentials. Carne asada is a good judge of what's hot and what's not in these places, and theirs was too chewy, and in tiny pieces...but, it was well-seasoned.  That being said, this is the kind of place you'll only go if you're stuck in the neighborhood a while...you can't find better for miles in any direction."}
{"text":"This is a little family owned place that has Menudo every day. Who does that? It was very good. Broth was flavorful and the meat was so tender. I had mine with corn tortillas. They cook them to order on their flat top. The only negative, and this is my own personal thing is the TV. I really hate them in restaurants unless it's a sports bar. I find it to loud and distracting. There are about 39 items on their menu. Did I mention the Menudo. I will be coming back to try some other items. I expect they will also be great. Maybe some Sopitos."}
{"text":"Worst food I have tried seriously, the salsa tasted like canned salsa the menudo stank and it tasted so bad. The beans smelled horrible too. Will never ever come here again. So gross"}
