{"text":"I went there around three times. I tried many different kinds of noodles and side dishes. There's not even one dish leave me a deep impression. Flavours are just very very so so. I especially want to mention their lamb skewers are salty and try, hard to chew. Staffs there are quick to respond but with no slime."}
{"text":"Today went to this restaurant for dinner and found the standard of the chef is always not disappoint. To pasta , barbecue supplement. Have to say , their home tamarisk skewers , biangbiang came face unique . Multi- component to a person can not eat , and gave me a coupon , the store not only eat the food , but also accounted for a cheaper this store ."}
{"text":"I came around noon when they just opened. There was no AC yet and they were still setting up. The tables were quite dirty and the cups are all chipped (I wouldn't use them). 

We ordered a few bbq/pan fried dishes and a braised beef noodles. The prices are pretty reasonable. While waiting for the food we filled up a plate of cold appetizers for $5.99. There's around 20 dishes to choose from. 

The bbq skewers were not bad. Lots of flavour and very fresh. The beef ones were a little tough. The clams were my favourite. No empty shells but would've preferred if there was some vermicelli on the bottom. 

The braised beef in the noodles were super tough and fatty.  We left most of it uneaten. The noodle texture was good though. 

I saw on Instagram there was a promotion where you get an equivalent value of what you spend in coupons. I asked the waitress when ordering if they still have the promotion and she said yes. After we got the bill she gave us six $10 coupons. HOWEVER, only one could be used per visit with over $50 of items ordered excluding tax. THIS IS VERY MISLEADING. This should be disclosed on Instagram and even when I asked. We felt very disappointed. Their prices are not expensive but it's quite hard to eat $50 worth of items for two people and ONLY $10 OFF.

We would've came back in the future to use the coupons if it was more like $10 off $25 or multiple coupons allowed but probably not $10 off $50."}
{"text":"Before one order BBQ fish tofu come 2 pieces, but right now only one, and it cost 2$, amazing price!!! Bad experience!"}
{"text":"Good food and it comes with big portion as well! The only thing is we come from America. They do not take cash, credit card nor American debit card... kinda driving us nuts to look around for ATMs. Not a flexible place I would say."}
{"text":"First time trying Xi'an chinese cuisine.  Nice clean place, if speaking English, speak slowly to the staff, I had to repeat myself a couple times.  Was looking for Biang Biang Noodles and this was 1 of the few locations in Scarborough that turned up on the search.  We ordered House Special Biang Biang Noodles (101), and Liang Pi (106).  

We were curious to try those 2 dishes since Mikey Chen of Strictly Dumpling on Youtube has mentioned those in multiple videos.

We enjoyed the Biang Biang Noodles (except a bit too much oil? or hot oil?). This dish was very hard to share since the noodles were so long.  We're kinda new to hand pulled noodles, we did enjoy the noodles very much, nice chewy noodles, tho be warned very slippery to consume with chopsticks.  We did enjoy the change of pace that the dish was more dry rather than soupy.  We had asked for it mild and not spicy.  Since we like tasting what we eat and not having our meal overwhelmed by spicy heat.  In the event that a dish happens to be bland, then we add condiments.  

We didn't enjoy the Liang Pi dish as much, we don't mind that it is a cold dish, we found the noodles a bit too stiff for our tastes.

As for value of portion size to price paid, the Biang Biang noodles cost $9.99 before taxes, based on what we received we feel that the dish is over priced.  For the portion sized received this would likely be better suited at a $7.99 or $6.99 price point. The reason I say portion size is small, is because my wife and I usually share dishes, most places (not all mind you) 1-2 dishes is usually enough for us to share from and still have leftovers for take home, at this resto this was not the case.  Noodle dishes here feel more like single serving and not for sharing.  

They do accept Debit as payment.  This is an important aspect for us, since we don't always bring cash on hand.  I did Yelp Qin Tang and Google foodie search it as well, to check if they accepted debit.

According to other Yelpers some of the other noodle dishes are portioned larger?  Since there are other noodles dishes we would like to taste (305, 307, 310) we will be back in the future to confirm if the portion size is larger than the portion size of the House Special Biang Biang noodle."}
{"text":"Want to stay warm this winter? Eat here! Their spicy food will warm you up from 0 to 100 in no time.

My absolute favourite thing(s) here are the skewers. They. Are. BOMB. They have a pretty good variety (ex. lamb, pork, chicken cartilage), and they can go for as little as $0.99 when you order 5+! I'd be happy to just come here with friends and throw back some beers to go with a meal comprised of only skewers... Try the whole fish skewer too. Super crispy and smoky!

Their noodles are handmade here so definitely get a bowl of these to try. They offer the thick noodles here too - the width is similar to the size of the bandages you use to wrap around your hand! Super chewy, or \"QQ\" as some would describe.

They also offer great value with a giant spicy bowl of vegetables and meat for only $12.99. They say the portion is for 1 person, but trust me... This can probably feed a family of 4.

Pro Tip: Make sure to ask for a glass of soy milk to keep you cool... And some extra napkins to wipe your sweat too!"}
{"text":"Good taste, lousy service, highly questionable hygiene, and stupid owner.
After waiting for 45min as a group of 4 adults + 1 kid, our booth was finally ready. And the owner gave it away to a 5+2, then asked me if we could fit in a 2-person square table. Are you fucking kidding me?! When I confronted him, he said he thought the other group came before us, which was obviously a lie!
I kept confronting him and he put two square tables together for us.

If you like the food here, you better order take-out!"}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Service was great here and stood out from many other Asian joints. Dishes were well spiced with varying depths of flavour.

Had the 'hand slapped' noodles and the texture was great. Will have to try the robotic noodles next time."}
{"text":"The lamb kebab price must have increased. I saw a number of reviews mentioning 99c, but when we went it was 4 for $6. 

For kebabs I still prefer Yangs BBQ, but this place is good as well. 

Stick skewer kebab was really good. I guess they can use big chunks of meat since its a strong stick. Meat was juicy and flavor was great. Note this is pricier than the regular lamb kebabs, but still worth trying imo. 

The fish kebab and cabbage kebabs were pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere.

The Biang Biang Noodles was a very interesting dish. First time having this. I'd say its basically Chinese pasta (which is not too strange a dish given pasta's origins)... it has what appears to be mince meat and tomatoes. I really liked the texture of the noodles. And the flavor was interesting too... pasta with a hint of Chinese flavor imo 

Parking lot is fairly big. Takes debit"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw an appealing picture on instagram and was also craving lamb skewers. Its hard to find a place with good skewers and I think I've found the place! Service overall was efficient, friendly and polite. Only downside is that it the skewers were a tad salty however my plain wonton soup definitely balanced it out just right. I also dont really order chicken wings at a Chinese restaurant but this location grilled it to perfection with the right crisp and flavour! Environment is kept clean and I enjoy the Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling :)  I am most definitely looking forward to coming back (even though it is out of my way)."}
{"text":"Typical chinese place. We came here because we got caught on the marketing tactics by toronto foodies. We ordered Bian bian noodles, grilled cabbage, and the pork bun. The bun itself was good and the pork is pretty tender and juicy! Noodle was decent as it came without any surprises. But the grilled cabbage was raw for some parts of it. Wouldn't drive here during winter because the parking lot is too far from entrance."}
{"text":"Great place for someone who is a big fan of spicy food. My friends loved their noodles and big bowl of spicy vegetable and meet (only $12.99) !! I like their Pita Bread Soaked in Lamb Soup and skewers. Perfect for beer."}
{"text":"It was my second time here. I called in for reservation around 5:30pm and asked for a table of 4. They said no reservation for group of 4, just come in. Got here at 7:30pm, it wasn't as busy as the first time I came. There was an empty booth could fit 5 people (i sat there before as a group of 5). They refuse to let us sit there, instead they let us wait for 2 single tables and combine them together. Their excause was some one reserved that table. (oh really!) Four of us standed beside the cash counter for 20 minutes. (that booth was still empty when we leave)
Only recommendation is their noodles, especially the\"bian bian noodle\". Other than that, food is salty, too much spicy. The lamb skewers are a bit dry and salty. I really cannot think of anything good other than their noodles.  I dont think i will come here again."}
{"text":"I am concerned that this Chinese Restaurant possesses severe food problem. They got bug in the noodle. Watch out your noodle. They are toxic.??????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Environment:
And you thought beijing had bad air pollution!?!  This restaurant had poor ventilation and no regard for the cardio safety of its customers and staff. I know they use charcoal because you can smell the fumes as soon as you walk in.  I was gagging because I am very sensitive to smoke.  I ate and got the hell out of there as soon as possbile. It cant be good for you to inhale charcoal fumes for an hour.  I should add:  the chinese people dont seem to mind at all. The place was packed and had a line up. This is a deal breaker for me.

In correct use of charcoal:
When using charcoal you can use lighter fluid to start the fire. But you always let it burn away the carcinogens for a good solid 30 mins before putting anything on the grill. These guys dont seem to practice this as the food tastes like lighter fluid.  Twice now I have tried the bbq skewers and every single time it comes with the taste yiu get when you use lighter fluid and when you don't wait long enough for the carcinogens to burn off. 

The food:
In terms of quality these guys are pretty hardcore and make mainland xian style noodles better than some of the places in China. They are the real deal. But they aren't good at all thing. Depending on what you order its either a  3/5 or 4.5/5. 

1.  skewered lamb - 4/5 minus 0.5 for tasting like lighter fluid = 3.5/5
2. Skewered fish - 3/5 minus 0.5 for tasting like lighter fluid = 2.5/5
3. Cold noodles (not hand made) in chili oil and garlic - 3.5/5.
4. Hand made, one strand flour noodles in tomato, minced pork and chili oil.

Conclusion:
The only real standout here are the hand made noodles. If i come back it will be for take out to avoid breathing in the toxic air.  All the other xian/shanxi style bbq items can be easily had at other similar restaurants without the lighter fluid flavour or the cancer causing polluted air.  For a sit down meal, i will be going to my usual Shannxi restaurant on hwy 7."}
{"text":"I recently saw several other friends try out this place so I decided to go check it out myself. 
The place was clean and the staff member that helped us was very nice despite not being able to communicate with her in Mandarin.
The menu was simple with a variety of flavors to choose from. I mainly noticed noodle dishes, \"Chinese burgers\", and skewers on their menu. 
I walked into this place knowing that they were known for their hand pulled ribbon noodles that looked nothing like anything I've ever head before so I simply went for the commonly ordered, Biang Biang along with an order of squid skewer. 
Many people were ordering their skewers I noticed. From lamb, to squid, to frog legs! But I have to say, they all smelled and looked delicious! I enjoyed the squid.
Now onto the noodles. I was expecting it to be spicy but for me, it wasn't. The bowls are huge!! I'd suggest sharing! The noodles were good, some were thicker than others in which I preferred the thinner ones. The broth was a tomato and egg light soup that was tasty, but I was expecting more soup in my bowl. It came with one, yes one, vegetable (bak choy) in this huge bowl along with some ground meat. 
In my mind, it wasn't bad. But I guess I was expecting more as the presentation looked really good. But hey, if I'm ever craving some skewers and there's no night market going on, I know where to go!"}
{"text":"Tried the lamb skewers and the Biang Biang noodles here since the Yelpers raves about how good it is... Well, I'm here to tell you... it's not very good. The dishes and tea cup, and serving plates all have this dried-on greasy/grimy feeling to them. It was so gross I couldn't even force myself to drink tea out of the cup. Sorry, but I would never recommend anyone to come."}
{"text":"The food was good overall, the service we got wasn't so bad as other reviewers have commented about. My only complaint was that the place was hot and stuffy, not sure if the place is like that all the time or that their a/c is broken that day only. The lamb skewers on the stick had a very strong lamb taste, my husband liked it but I couldn't take it. But I loved the fish on skewer! And everyone loved their signature BiangBiang Noodles but the soup noodles didn't have as good of a texture. The pork hamburger was really dry, had better ones before elsewhere. Overall we got a decent amount of food for the price we paid."}
{"text":"Going there on a Saturday for dinner was a bet. It seemed a bad idea after we passed by and look a crowd waiting. We were tense while the hunger was kicking in and the parking spots were inexistent... 

We scored when we got a spot for 2 at a funky column with a bar table!!! Sorry for those groups waiting.

I would advise you to watch the items you order because the portions are big. A soup can fill four of the cup bowls, and the 3 orders of skewers were too much for a want to be fit couple.

The order of a hand made noodle specialty that was forgotten for our waiter was lucky for us; we were surrounded by plates, thinking about asking the 2nd soup to go.

This restaurant gave me the thought: If I ever want to prank someone, or make them suffer, I will bring them here and ask for the ultra spicy skewers... 

What we got on those chopped members on a stick, was a lazy attempt to deliver that pain/pleasure sensation the chili addicts constantly search. The taste was artificial, the meats were completely covered with that red dust that tried to kill us by drowning; making us cough, cry, and... wonder why we asked them.

The goat soup was delicious: comforting, with tender slices of meat, and consistent pieces of pancake.

The black mushrooms came cold, with slices of red chillie and a wasabi after taste. They are an interesting option if you like crunchy-chewy textures, or if you are into exotic veggies.

It is definitely an affordable, authentic, popular, and interesting spot to visit if you are in the area (just avoid the infamous red dust)."}
{"text":"Mmmm yummy! I've been seeing photos of food from Qin Tang Taste on Instagram for a while now, and finally got the chance to try it!

I came on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch, and it wasn't busy at all. The menu comes in the form of a dim sum ordering sheet, which is quite convenient. Every table also gets their own kettle of tea, so you don't have to keep asking for refills.

1) Lamb skewers ($5.99 for 4) - We got half an order of mild and half spicy. They were grilled perfectly, the meat was nice and tender! The mild skewers were actually quite bland, so I'd recommend the spicy ones for more flavour.

2) Biangbiang hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodles ($8.99 for Small) - SO good! Decided to try this after reading such good reviews on this dish. This may have been the best hand-pulled noodles I've had in Toronto! The noodles were thick (both length and width), and super chewy. It came with minced pork, bok choy, and tomato and egg sauce. They also put a bit of chilli oil in the noodles, which adds a bit of a kick to the noodles, and somehow surprisingly pairs well with the slight sourness of the tomato sauce. I highly recommend trying this dish, if you're in the mood for dry noodles not soaked in broth!

3) Robot-made shanxi sliced noodle in braised beef soup ($8.99 for S) - Unlike the perfectly flat and thick hand-pulled noodles, the robot-made ones were less thick and more \"textured\" and uneven. Even when soaked in the soup-base, the noodles still remained really chewy! The beef was very tender, and the soup base was really strong and tasty. The soup flavour seeped into the noodles, so the noodles tasted amazing even without having to drink the soup with it!

The noodle portions were pretty big, even for the small size. 2-3 people could probably share the large size, especially if you get appetizers on the side!

I will definitely be coming back here, and I look forward to trying the Chinese cabbage skewer next time!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of Kennedy and McNicoll is this newly opened hidden gem! My boyfriend and I love noodles so we were really looking forward to trying this place out. 

We ordered the lamb skewers which is a minimum of 5 orders @ $0.99 per skewer which isn't bad at all. You also have the option of getting spicy or non-spicy. It appears to be one of the most popular items as we saw almost every table ordering this. Good quality, super tasty lamb. Heads up for those who are sensitive to the smell of lamb meat that it's pretty strong especially since it's grilled. But really worth it and a must order!

My boyfriend opted for hand slapped & pulled ribbon noodle in clear beef soup and I got the biangbiang hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodle. We got the bigger size for a dollar extra ($8.99) and the bowl was huge! We were absolutely starving and we struggled to finish (I didn't and took the leftovers home). The noodles were fantastic. Biangbiang bowl had eggs, bokchoy and minced pork. All the components were delicious and worked really well together. The clear beef soup had no wow factor but again, pretty solid. The broth was good but pretty much looked like a bowl of pho. My dad had the leftovers the next day and he fell in love with the noodles. Will definitely be back to try some of their other stuff!

Service was friendly but a bit lacking becayse none of the servers could really speak English. Only language there is Mandarin so expect some communication difficulties if you don't speak it. So I'm taking off 1 star due to the service. 

NOTE: They currently only accept cash or debit but not sure if it's only because they just opened."}
{"text":"I've had Qin Tang Taste bookmarked for quite a while now. I'm very pleased to have finally come. I was surprised there were so few people during lunch on Sunday, given how many people have written good reviews about this place. That's alright with me. I like quiet.

I enjoyed my grilled toothpick fish skewer. No actual toothpicks. At $1.99, I'd say it's worth it for sure. Other than the spine and the eyeballs, one can basically eat the entire fish, including the head and tails. A tad spicy, but very tasty.

One of my friends had the handmade noodle with braised beef brisket in beef soup ($8.99). The noodles were a tad thick for me, but the soup was flavorful and the brisket was quite tender. 

Another of my friends had the robot-made Shanxi sliced noodles with house special sauce ($7.99). I did not see the robot. These noodles were flat and broad and chewy. The house special sauce is spicy, slightly sweet, and very fragrant. It's got lots of ground pork and veggies in it as well. 

My third friend got the Chinese pancake filled with sliced leek and omelette ($7.99). This one was tasty, but quite overpriced. Usually, this item is about $4.99 at other restaurants. This one may have been just slightly larger in portion than those other restaurants, but it wasn't outstanding. That being said, the pancake part was crisp and there was a good amount of filling inside. She also got the glutinous rice balls in osmanthus soup ($2.99). If I recall correctly, there were 8 black sesame filled glutinous rice balls in her bowl. It was a pretty good deal.

I got the lamb stew with vegetables and chopped Chinese pancake, aka lamb pao mo ($8.99). It's not quite a stew. It's a lamb broth with chopped Chinese pancake (think chopped English muffin), bamboo shoots and wood ear fungus, lamb slices, and a quail egg. The broth was delicious. You could definitely tell it was lamb soup. The lamb slices were tasty as well. This dish was hot, comforting, and very filling. I wish there had been some more broth though. If you take a long time to eat it, the bread soaks in all the broth.

The noodle portions here are very generous. The two noodles plus the lamb pao mo would have been enough to fill the four of us, and those were only the small sizes. The large sizes are a dollar more. 

Oh. Their music playlist is a tad eclectic. We sat down to a number of tracks from one of the latest Kdramas (Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, anyone?), then heard some hip hop and some R&B, if I have my musical genres right. That was interesting.

Great food and good prices. I can't wait to come back!"}

{"text":"With hand-pulled, hand cut noodles to die for and excellent skewers, you ought to come to Qin Tang Taste for authentic northern chinese food.

I went with their house special biang biang mian, and this bowl of noodles literally spoke to me. It was amazing! The noodles had a satisfying chewiness and a thickness that seemed to coat all that sauce so well. It's a tad difficult to eat with the oily noodles slipping out of your chopsticks and the length of the noodles forcing you to stick your face first into the bowl. But enjoy! This is one delicious bowl of noodles, with the right amount of spice and acidity coming from the tomatoes. I am a huge fan of a complex, intense flavours and this is it! I probably could have used more veggies here as there was only one piece of Bok Choy, but there was a good amount of everything else and the portion size is perfect.

I only went with one lamb skewer here but it was well done and was well priced to boot. $1.69 for one skewer is very reasonable. The lamb skewer was tender and had the right amount of fragrance and spice on it. It was grilled well and I regret not ordering more. There is a huge menu of many well priced grilled delicacies here."}
{"text":"This place is authentic Chinese food! The service is usually pretty hit or miss. There are a few younger employees that speak English perfectly but there are days where no one does. There is also never a line on a weekend for lunch. 

They have a cold appetizer and salad bar which for about $6 you can fill up as much as you can into a small dish - lots of variety including salted crispy fish, seaweed salad, quail eggs, spicy bean sprouts etc. Great value

BiangBiang Noodles portion is huge theres no way I could eat that all myself. The noodles were large and flat and came with an asian style tomato sauce, it was almost pasta-like. 

The Shanxi-style Pork bun comes with crispy flat bread and stuffed with greasy pork, its pretty oily but flavorful like asian style pulled pork. 

Love the mini hot pot soups. The lamb one is filled with fatty lamb meat pieces and the flavor is very strong in a good way. And comes with melon and you can add noodles and extra veggies on the side. Ask for their garlic sweet soy sauce - its delicious! 

The prices are very affordable and you get a lot of food for the price, the place doesn't feel the cleanest but the food makes up for it. Sometimes they also have social media specials (eg. Posting on instgram gets you discounted appetizers etc)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service not so much. If you don't speak Chinese I advise to avoid or come here with someone that does because they don't understand any English. When we asked our server for 2 coronas and a fork he looked so confused and didn't bring our drinks until we asked him again. The mugs were rusty and chipped and looked like I would catch something by drinking out of them. Our server never cleared our table when we were done our dishes and he and the rest of the staff proceeded to have lunch at the table behind us while we were still eating. But the food was tasty and seasoned very nicely"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the town. I've been there for twice since it's launched about two weeks ago. They might make the best Shanxi food in Toronto. Recommend their Biang Biang noodle, vegetables cooked in home special chill sauce. I've already made a membership card there, will try more food every weekend."}
{"text":"Other than the lamb skewers that tasted good the other stuff was mediocre at best...the peanut noodle was all matted together hard to mix the sauce that they just scoop on too. The eggplant with meat hand chopped noodle also didn't have enough 'sauce' so it was dry and not flavoured all throughout...There was also a drunk person sleeping in another booth that they had to wake up to give us the seat which they were atleast good enough to move two tables together in a different area so we wouldn't have to be next to them...."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"northwest style stir fried hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodle\". Sadly I was extremely disappointed. It looked and tasted like a terrible Chinese version of spaghetti with tomato sauce. 

I've had the noodle soups in the past and thought they were great! This experience has shown me that this place is ONLY good for that."}
{"text":"QinTang Taste is a Beijing-based chain, and with their first international location they bring Shaanxi (Northwestern) Chinese cuisine to Toronto (or at least a Scarborough condo). If all you associate with Chinese food is rice-this and rice-that, the complete lack of rice on the menu will be the first thing to kick you in the ass. Dishes of the region skew towards wheat, and with that, noodles and lots of it. Also, spices, which will be the next thing to kick your ass.

It is gluttonous nonetheless when you start piling on noodle orders and whatnot. Many of the food here are quite spicy, which will disappoint chili weaklings, but on an extreme cold-as-fuck winter day it comes as a relief--request extra napkins for all the sweatin' to be had! The menu was a bit perplexing and amusing to read, as many of the noodles were listed as either traditionally hand-pulled, or shamelessly \"robot-made.\" The difference in quality between the two is probably in the chewiness.

The grilled meats come with plenty of wow factor. The lamb skewers coated in a liberal dosing of cumin seeds were great with blast of gamey and spicy flavours. Even crazier were the barbeque bullfrog legs, which does literally taste like chicken (not to be cliche or anything) with an extreme chili kick. Sweet and floral, garnished with osmanthus petals, the rice balls in osmanthus soup was a great surprise from all this gluttonous and spicy eats we've been having.

Qin Tang Taste is relatively cheap and crazy-spicy, and with the amount of food you get, you feel you own the world. Service is generally good, and one can get by with basic English communication with the Mandarin-centric staff. Just don't get the pineapple beer, it is novel nothing in a can. If you're hungry at Pacific Mall, you're better off in my opinion heading south a short bit to check this place out.

{TTC: take either the 42 or 43A to McNicoll at Kennedy Road.}"}
{"text":"The place is half decent. It seemed I ordered a boat full at first but the food actually goes down well. So overeating and ordering could be a problem. The food is OK but the portion size and pricing makes up for any slack that exists in the food.

Couple problems. No images on menu, so if you are unfamiliar with nontraditional Chinese dishes you may have difficulty navigating but it does contain English.  So you'll see things like beef, lamb, or noodles and just go on a whim. Can't go wrong right.

Another problem is the meat just seems like it has too much fat which makes it tastier but being a health guy, I had to deduct a point as I like my meats lean as can be."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times before. It's been a while about a year and I was craving their massive bowl of noodle so decided to come here. The place looked completely different this time. They rebranded it to Xin Qin Tang. The decor looks much better now and place is much brighter. Other than that everything went downhill. They don't have a paper menu as before. You just lookup what you want and order. 

I ordered the braised beef noodle soup and I was disappointed. They reduced the size of the bowl and made it more expensive. The noodle was ok but this time no choice on thickness level. Meat and broth was quite fatty. Not sure if I will come back again."}
{"text":"I've passed by this noodle house on a few ocassions and have always seen it to be packed on late nights so I've been meaning to try it out. It was quite dead with only a few seated tables when I came to eat in at a bit past 7. I went for what was mostly well known and recommended when looking through Yelp reviews and Instagram pictures the Biang Biang noodles. The description on the menu had said they were handmade noodles with house special sauce. But when my order had came out, I was terribly disgusted by overly drenched chilli oil noodles... OH, I don't even think they can be defined as noodles as they were more so chunky pieces of undercooked teared up pieces of dough. Perhaps they were going for a rustic type of noodle... But still, the cut was too large that it felt I was chewing gummy worms. Needless to say I lost my appetite due to the overwhelming amount of oil and the ratio of carbs over veggies and meat in the dish. My parents unlike me had ordered soups. My mum, a beef noodle soup and my dad the beef brisket soup, and both felt the same way about their torn up pieces of dough as I did, however their broths were divinely delicious.  

On another note, looking into the appitizers, the lamb skewers were pretty good though mediocre in comparison to the bbq squid skewers which were cooked and seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"Located on the corner or mcnicoll and kennedy. This noodle place is great for comfort food. I love the lamb skewers here. and the noodles are great to share. my go to dinner place after work. It does get packed after 7 and seating can be tight. Must try their noodles"}
{"text":"-1 star only because they messed the order, twice!
However the food itself was AMAZING - flavors and texture portrayed Northern Chinese cuisine perfectly. 100% recommend!

Tried:
1. BiangBiang Noodles (MUST try - super chewy flatnoodles in minced beef, tomato and eggs, veggies)
2. Lamb Skewers (decent flavor)
3. Shanxi-style Pork Burger (good texture and juicyness)
4. BBQ Bullfrongs (a little over on the oil)
5. Stirfried Rice noodles 
6. Spicy Cold chicken feet (quite very spicy!!)

\the restaurant was well furnished and was distinguishable via its traditional Chinese decor and menu."}
{"text":"We ordered a mixed noodle bowl and a beef noodle soup for that night. The mixed noodle bowl was alright. I don't like the taste. On the other hand, the beef noodle soup smelled very good and the soup had enough taste to it. I wanted to give out more stars to this place but seriously waiting for 45 min for the beef noodle soup wasn't good a experience. I was pacing myself when eating my mixed noodle bowl. I almost finished my bowl and the beef noodle soup finally arrived to our table which was kind of pointless since one side was almost finished. 

I guess they were cutting their noodles in the kitchen so it took them this long to make?

This is a place that took the longest to make their noodle soup out of all the restaurants I tried so far. Anyway it was a bad experience and we won't come here again."}
{"text":"3.5

Pros:
Very good portions
Unique items to be had

Cons:
Service can be hit or miss

Came here based on the previous reviews.  I can safely say the food was almost everything as promised. This place is a bit on the smaller side if you ask me.  They have two booths at the front and a larger table at the back.  Everything else is tables for 2 ideally.  You can fit a third person but that person is probably blocking the walkway for the waitresses and will be a bit awkward.  If the booth and the large table are taken, good luck trying to get in with a party of 4 or more.  The place is also super busy even at 530pm!!

This place has a lot of unique items available I have not seen elsewhere. They have a skewer that uses a stick of wood as the skewer which is a Toronto first, it even says it on the menu!  We ordered a large size beef brisket noodle, the wooden skewer, regular lamb skewers, a corn skewer and some dumplings.

Like I said, the food is mostly what everyone has said in past reviews.  The skewers were all very good.  They all had a good amount of spice to them.  The noodles came in a huge bowl that could easily feed 3 maybe 4 if you're not big eaters.  The corn skewer was very good, my little one can attest to that. It was nothing but yum yum yum from her as she was eating it.  The dumplings seem to supermarket dumplings which in the end I'm OK with because it's not the specialty of this place. 

The service is where I had issues with.  There three younger servers and one older one working at the time.  The older one was very good and proficient.  The 3 younger ones seem to all be working for the first time in my opinion.  They must of dropped plates and cups at least 6-7 times while we were there.  It became a running joke with all the other customers as well.  Every time it happened the customers would all giggle together. We had asked for tea (which is standard at every table) because we had not gotten ours.  We had all of our food and it still hadn't shown up.  Finally the older server noticed and got us our tea.  When she questioned the younger server why, she just shrugged and moved on like it didn't matter.  i would of easily given this place 4 stars but I think the shrug irked me a bit.  It's not something I like to see at all.

All in all, still a great place if you like northern Chinese food.  I'm hoping my experience there in terms of service was just a red herring."}
{"text":"Saw some good reviews of this new place, so we decided to try it out.

Service: friendly and prompt

Food: personally, I love spicy food and I found the food has different depth of spices for each dish. Therefore, even we were eating different spicy dishes and won't feel they are all the same after all.

These are the dishes I enjoyed

Hand-slapped and pulled noodles - love the chewy noodles and the spices make it taste so special.

Sour Soup dumpling (it is spicy) - it is another kind of spices we tasted which is well-balanced with the sour soup - my favourite

Grilled lamb skewers - they chose the fatty lamb meat so the skewers are juicy and soft. Love it

Grilled squid skewers - fresh and tasty squid. I can eat a lot of these


Dish that I did not very enjoy -
Shanxi style Pork Burger (fatty and lean pork) - the filling pork is tasty and juicy, but the \"burger\" is too hard to be enjoyable.

I will definitely go back to try more dishes. The hand-slapped and pulled noodles (biang biang mien) is definitely must try dish if you can handle the spiciness."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the restaurant itself. The decor is really nice and the place is clean when you walk in. There was a short wait for a table because there was a wedding reception going on. A little surprising, since the place is kind of small, but not a problem for us. However, they had \"here comes the bride\" playing on repeat throughout our entire experience. Not going to lie, that song started driving me nuts halfway through our meal.

The service here is kind of lacklustre. The wait staff are a bit mindless and won't bring you tea or anything unless you ask. They just hand in your order, bring your food, then bring you the bill. Anything else you will need to flag them down for.

We had the Chinese bun skewer, Chinese cabbage skewer, bull frogs legs and biang biang noodles. The cabbage and bun are slathered in this salty sauce which makes it tasty, but the frogs legs need a lot of work. I was really curious to know what they taste like since everyone always says they taste like chicken. They did not, they have the consistency of chicken but taste more like fish. The legs were crispy, and the inside was juicy, but they needed a lot more seasoning. The inside is really bland and the outside needed some salt.

The hand pulled noodles are thick, bouncy and chewy. Probably the most redeeming quality of this place. But even though the noodles were good, it was a turn off to see so much oil slathered on. Since the menu has no pictures, we chose the biang biang based on the server's recommendation. I would come back here to try other things, but probably not if there's another wedding reception going on."}
{"text":"The restaurant specializes in noodles with almost half of their menu being handmade ones. Ordered 2 bowls; 1 noodle with sliced pork and black bean sauce; and 1 biang biang noodles. Their lamb skewers were pretty good but could be better with more seasoning and spice. Was totally surprised by the portion sizes after underestimating the Yelp photos as their large size can easily feed 2 people for about $10. Wished they provided photos to their menu though as it was quite difficult to choose which ones to order since they all sounded delicious!"}
{"text":"I love noodles, those home made chewy QQ ones are definitely my favourite!

Hot and Sour Dumplings Noodle was really good! A great balance for hot and sour which further enhanced by finely chopped scallions. At first I was a little confused and wondering where's the noodle? Apparently they were used to made the wrapping of the dumplings.

I will be back for some real noodle next time. And maybe some BBQ skewers. The lamb skewers $.99 each with minimum of 5

Biang Biang Noodle The noodles, touted as one of the \"ten strange wonders of Shaanxi\" (Chinese: ?????), are described as being like a belt, owing to their thickness and length.* source Wikipedia"}
{"text":"I used to come here quite a bit because of 1. Their biang biang noodles which I can't seem to find another place with 2. Their lamb skewers. And one day we realized it closed down for renovations and stopped going. When they opened up again, they had rebranded to QT Grill, but with the same owners. 

They changed the layout a bit, instead of ordering off a menu, you had to walk around and pick what you wanted, and write it on a list. It didn't feel very natural especially since the store is very small, so the flow of the whole experience was strange. I'm sure it'll be ironed out after a while. The biang biang noodles are the most unique thing on their menu so I really hope that they make it taste how it used to. 

The decor is way nicer and more hip than it used to be. They added mini hot pots that are pretty cheap too. They also serve cheap pitchers of beer (Amber Brewery) which goes great with skewers!"}
{"text":"Qin Tan Taste is a kid on the block. Originated from Beijing, Qin Tan Taste serves up authentic noodles, dumplings and skewers!

Tucked away in the \"grave site\" for countless restaurants - Kennedy and McNicoll, Qin Tan Taste is the best of its kind. Each dish is filled with unique flavours, not a single dish shared the same flavour.

We ordered a range of dishes including season soy-based jelly fish ($5.99), sour and spicy dumpling ($8.99), spice braised-beef thick noodles ($7.99), sour and spicy potato salad ($3.99), cumin spiced lamb skewer ($0.99 each, 5 orders minimum), spiced sausage ($5.99), Chicken soft bone skewer ($1.59 each, 2 orders minimum), five spice bean curd with cucumber (instead of celery in the menu) ($4.99), and cold mung bean noodle ($5.99). The only dish I would not recommend would be spiced sausage. Spare your change for more delicious skewers! 

Also worth noting is Qin Tan Taste's staff. They are by far the most polite staff in any Asian restaurant I have even been to! For the first time, in the history of Asian restaurant explained the dish to you and ask if you are finish with the plate before taking it away. I was shocked at their etiquette.  

Overall, Qin Tan Taste is a feast in flavour town! Can't wait to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot if I'm craving skewers and a large bowl of yummy noodles. You really can't go wrong with their prices....

However, their giant meat on a stick thing ( dont know the name ..hahah) wasnt worth it....nothing special to be honest"}
{"text":"im going to give this post a title:
DEATH By Chilli Pepper

tried several dishes while i was here.. 

1. qq noodles - pretty much their signature noodle bowl. one long noodle unbroken.. it was really good.. probably the best thing on their menu .. very unique chewy long noodle

2. hot and sour dumplings - very very vinegary... pretty much its dumplings in seasoned hot red vinegar.. concentrated and not watered down vinegar.

3. cold noodle mixed with sesame and hot sauce.- very good but unfortunately the portion is very small for this.. a snack size for me.

4. lamb skewers - not charred enough ..i take that back.. not charred at all. absolutely no grill taste on my skewers... wish it had more grill flavor

5. squid on skewer - not bad, tasted like hoisin sauce on it.

6.  mantao bread skewer - strange for me.. not use to bbq bao... it was basted in oil.. just a lil strange.. i think i prefer it steamed with condense milk

7. i saved the best for last...Green Chili Peppers on skewer.

if you want your mouth to die you can try it... i can take some heat, but this was on another level .. after eating it.. you might laugh and be like haha delicious.. thats all you got?  then wait about 45 seconds and prepare for the death of your taste buds..   if you like pain and bitter numbness, this chilli pepper will do it...  

took me a whole soy milk to get those skewers down.. try drinking it with hot tea.. it makes it feel even worse.  

take the challenge and get the green peppers!  

tip:  they had a promotion only advertised in chinese.. where you add them to your wechat and get a free bowl of noodle soup upon your next visit.   dont know if that promo is over now."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is tricky, at least it was for me. I've always gone to WB cooking next door and honestly that was the only place I knew existed in this small plaza (if you'd even call it that). Because of the beams, I've been pulling the blind eye to this place until recently. It's pretty sad considering I've visited WB on so many occasions already. 

Anyway, moving onto their food. They mostly do grill and I don't know how long ago this was, but they now serve alcohol (their beer is cheap, great for the grill!). I ordered the frog legs (min. 3 per purchase) and that came out not bad, the inside was tender and yummy, but the outside was a little dry. Spicing was just spicy and nothing else, not the usual cumin spice they put on the red meats. Overall, not bad. Might get again. Next their lamb skewers were decent, but they weren't as big as I last remembered. I'd still go to Xin Jiang Restaurant near steeles and warden for these though. 

Grilled chives were so salty, I don't know what kind of saucing they put on it but it definitely wasn't good. Chives were also hard to chew, not fresh at all. 

What was really good were the hand pulled noodles. Huge portions!! And so delicious! We got the tomato and egg noodles and still had so much leftovers even though there were three of us. Definitely give the noodles a try!

According to my parents, they really liked the appetizers. Said the chilled potato salad was good, and so was the spicy chilled beef? I'm not sure what they're called in English. The sizes were okay, kind of small to feed three people, maybe even two.

Service was the typical Chinese restaurant, acknowledge and do kind of thing. Quick on the days that aren't busy, but slower on the nights that are.

Overall, I'd come back but for the noodles."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre but service was terrible. My friend and I both ordered handmade noodle dishes. After waiting 15 minutes the server came back and told my friend to change to a different type of noodle because they would take a long time to make handmade noodles. He agreed because he didn't want to wait that long. Another 20 minutes passed and his food had still not come out - we asked the server how much longer it would take. 2 minutes was the answer we got... but we probably ended up waiting another 20 minutes for it. It was clear that they forgot about his food after they made him change his order to avoid a long wait. The place wasn't even busy enough to justify this type of screw up."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening dinner time, wait in line for about 20min to be seated. The ventilation is not so great, it was a little smokey. However the food was tasty, it's like restaurants in China. Bbq fish was very tender; biang biang mian is their signature dish and it didn't disappoint!
Price is also very affordable, 3 people comes to about 36 dollars. Cash or debit card only."}
