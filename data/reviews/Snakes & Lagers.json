{"text":"I'm a teacher from the East coast, who just came to Toronto for March Break for the first time to visit a girlfriend from university. My friend has been quite excited to bring me out to this place, and we've been looking forward to playing board games since I arrived. Before going out, we had 2 friends over for supper, and we shared a couple glasses of wine during the meal. Fast forward to a couple hours later; we get to the bar, and a server greets and seats us. She hands us menus and walks away. When she returns, before we can order, she says \"we don't serve people who have been drinking excessively\".  Confused, we asked if we are still allowed to play, or eat, or even stay. She answered with a firm \"no\", and told us to leave.  We were far from drunk - maybe buzzed, if we're being generous - and felt completely insulted.  I don't even know what else to say, except that I'm thoroughly upset with what happened tonight, and feel as though we were judged based on the fact that we looked young and were potentially going to be low paying customers, which - had we been given the opportunity, we would have proved that is not the case."}
{"text":"The good: I like the concept of the place, and I like the fact that they have a few vegan options on the menu. Went on a Saturday evening and got a table without too much of a wait  The bad: Found the board game selection disappointing, as compared to other board game places around the city. We were seated upstairs, and found it to be unbearably noisy. The tables are all so close together that it was impossible for me not to overhear and be distracted by other players, and I felt I had to nearly shout to have a conversation. Wasn't crazy about the general vibe of the place, either. I'd rather play somewhere like Castle on Spadina or Face to Face on the Danforth (which doesn't have a cover charge)."}
{"text":"Great concept, but unfortunately too popular to make it part of your Saturday plans, unless you arrive really really early.  I arrived just before 7 pm on a Saturday night, I was told the wait would be about an hour and a half. Two hours later I got a text telling me that the wait would be another two hours."}
{"text":"-wasn't told about the 6 person per booth rule when we called ahead -hostess and waiter were both really rude when we tried to fit a 7th person. We weren't arguing, we've just never been to a place that had such strict apparent liquor license rules about how many freakin ppl are in a booth! -so we awkwardly split our group into 2 and 5. Playing games with just a pair isn't as much fun! -then we all got 18% tip added to our bills, which is noted on their menu for groups of 6 or more. Yet if they don't allow groups of 6 or more, why the fuck did we get charged as such?! I didn't even get to speak to my group of friends! -asked a waiter how to play a game and without looking up from his tablet, said they were busy right now and would have to come back with an answer. Which he never did. And it wasn't that busy.  -not much of a selection of games. I've been to snakes and lattes where there's a ton more! -overall, never going back. Why not just stay at home to booze and game??"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Snakes and Lattes, my friends and I figured we should give this place a try.   When we got there, the hostess told us it might be a 1.5-2 hour wait, so we went to a nearby restaurant to grab some dinner and drinks. They called us and we rushed over because they said our table would be given to another party if we didn't get there in 5 minutes. We were seated on the 2nd floor and other than the smallness of the room, I immediately noticed this weird smell. The closer I sat to the wall, the stronger the smell would be, so I figured it was fumes from the kitchen going up the wall or something... maybe from the duck fat popcorn. Speaking of the food, it was really good, but ridiculously expensive. My friend saw that the cookies were $1.25 and ordered them, but didn't realize you'd only get ONE cookie. ONE COOKIE! That's just crazy. It was a good cookie though...   I think we all had a pretty good time. The game selection was alright, they didn't have some of the games we wanted to play, but we found other ones that were pretty fun regardless. One of my friends noticed that the person serving us pretty much stopped serving us after a while and we were ignored for the rest of the night, even though a couple of my friends wanted to order more food/drinks. My friend suspected the server thought we were drunk, even though I was the only person in our group that had the chance to order a drink and we were there for a few hours. To be fair, my friends and I can be a bit loud sometimes when we're laughing/having a good time, but we weren't behaving inappropriately. Maybe he just forgot about us??  Overall, it was an OK place, but not a place I'd be enthusiastic about. I might give it another try, perhaps on a quieter night, but I think I'm going to stick to Snakes and Lattes for now."}
{"text":"So first off, this place was a little difficult to find because you can't see the bar's name that clearly from the street (it was in large writing on the door however, which is a side entrance - not too helpful). But once we found it with the bar's address, we were excited to see what Snakes and Lagers had to offer; we're already fans of Snakes and Lattes! (Though recently, S&Lattes has had a huge wait time - last time we went, it was about 45min-1hr.) We checked this place out with the venture of drinks while board gaming and less wait time.  Apparently when we went, it was a preview night? When you go to the website, there's a countdown to when the bar will officially open. This joint is very small - narrow, even and could fit roughly 20 people. That being said, it was already quite busy there, and the only seats that were available were right by the door. My boyfriend had a cold and this would have made him feel worse. That's out of our control however.   For food I ordered the kale and chickpea salad which came in an adorable baby mason jar with a snap lid and was delicious. My boyfriend had the fried brussell sprouts which was equally amazing, served in a cute frying pan. Both were $4.50 each on the sides menu. Were they worth it? You're paying for quality, not serving amount. As for the drinks which we were curious to try, they were damn expensive ($8-$10) considering if people wanna stay for a few hours and keep a good buzz going. I suggest pre-drinking and coming here instead. Drinks seemed a disappointment cuz that's one of the reasons we wanted to go.  While waiting for our food, we were notified that there are more games upstairs which actually had WAY more space than downstairs and there are more game choices. Maybe they will open this place up too once the bar opens officially? Either way, we really wished they had some bartenders/people to recommend games upstairs as well, cuz we would've rather played there for the breathing room. Plus, the only bathrooms in this bar are upstairs.  We brought down two games we wanted to play and immediately our waitress took them away because they were \"party games\" aka 4 or more players. She instead brought us some 2 player games that weren't as exciting - we'd tried these games at S&Lattes before. When I asked what would happen if we tried to play a party game, she said it simply \"won't work\". We were both like wtf... So I guess they simply refuse to let you play the games you want? As far as we knew, there was no waitlist/priority given to groups who wanted those specific games so I saw no reason for her to take them away or at least letting us try to play them. All the other games were very meh so we didn't even bother playing. We finished our food and asked the gentleman who sat us if they were still going to charge us the entry fee of $5 if we didn't play any games; he kindly said no, waived the fees and we got our bill. No tip for the waitress, sorry.  We tried really hard to make the best of our situation but it just went downhill from the seating. Only good thing going for this place is the food quality. Unfortunately, this is the first time we walked out of a restaurant. I suggest you just go to S&Lattes, write your name down on the waiting list, and come back after an hour. This place isn't worth it.   TLDR; same entry price as S&Lattes ($5). Food is expensive, small amount, but great quality. Drinks were too expensive, don't bother. Okay selection of games. Wish they'd open up the upstairs lounge. Buzzkill waitress had bad customer service. Stick with S&Lattes."}
{"text":"First off: great intentions and great game selection, had a lot of fun with my friends. (Probably could have had as much fun at my house with delivery though).  Atmosphere: big booths were nice. Temperature changed from hot to cold frequently. Very oddly bright lights. Little to no music or artwork. Bathroom- single person, not clean... At all.  Games: good selection, had all pieces, games were a riot!  Drinks: also a good selection, missing a few from the menu but to be expected.  Service: unfortunately this was the low point of the experience. The hostess was really nice and got us excited for our experience. Our waiter was really off, he seemed quite stoned. He forgot to bring my beer twice. We then ordered (I ordered the pot pie, we also ordered other items including charcuterie board and fried pickles). 15 minutes later our waiter walks by and says oh at this time we don't have the pie.... Perhaps this could have been mentioned a little earlier. Luckily a short time later the food comes out, unfortunately really mediocre, at best. The charcuterie board was forgotten and then brought out 20 minutes after our mains after we mentioned it and he sleepily mumbled oh Ya I forgot that. One of the main meats was smoked trout? The fried pickles also never made an appearance.  I would not go back to this place unless they lowered the lighting, averaged the temperature, and hired a new wait staff."}
{"text":"Meh.   We somehow managed to snag a table without even waiting on a Saturday night (just 2 people) so that was a pleasant surprise.   However, our waiter was not great. He seemed in a constant sort of daze. (He may have been new.)   And the food was very, very bleh. The sweet & spicy popcorn (which I notice is no longer on the menu!) might've sounded good in theory but really just tasted like someone poured sugar and then chili powder on top. It was really unevenly coated, too!  Next, the 50/50 board (meat & cheese) sounded and even looked promising, but almost every cheese tasted the same (soft and brie-like) and there were like 4 crispy toast things in total, with a $3 charge if we wanted extra bread. Really now?   A lady came over about 30-40 minutes after we'd been there already and introduced herself as our waitress (wait, who was the other guy then?) and offered to show us new games and help teach us ones if we wanted. She was really nice, and gave us some good two-player suggestions.   If I came back here again, it'd solely be for the games and I'd definitely eat dinner before or after!"}
{"text":"I've been to Snakes & Lattes a couple of times, so when a friend suggested we add alcohol into the mix at Snakes & Lagers...well, who am I to say that wouldn't be an excellent idea? We went on a weekday evening, so the wait wasn't terrible.  The service was pretty rough going at first. A couple of servers just kept walking right past us ignoring us, which seems like it would be difficult given how small the place was. Finally, we got the attention of one server. He was very pleasant and helpful. He suggested a game, and later came back to show us how to play (we'd already played a round by that point as he was gone for so long, but details...).  I'd give it another go, but the alcohol wasn't so much of an added bonus that I wouldn't just return to Snakes & Lattes instead."}
{"text":"We love board games and its great to know another board games place opened in Toronto.  Snakes and Lagers and Snakes and Lattes are by the same owners I believe.  Snakes and Lattes often have a long line up and it is no different at Snakes and Lagers. I wish they could do reservations, since it is getting cold and waiting an hour outdoors in the cold is brutal! :(  The atmosphere is great and the staff there are all very knowledgeable and could give great board games recommendations.  The food is a little on the salty side though.  We had a great time overall, will be back!"}
{"text":"nice cozy place, small. staff was nice and helpful. the menu is awful for vegans. No non alcoholic drinks except pop which i don't drink the game section is very limited since they dont want it to be a bunch of people loitering and drinking water for hours so really if you like beer and simple short games come here, if not go to snakes and lattes"}
{"text":"Board game selection is great and so is the overall vibe. The staff is very knowledgable on games, however the servers are not particularly nice or attentive.  Beer selection is good but the food selection is pretty lame. Instead of popular snack items like fries, pizza pockets, pita and dip, etc, they offer things like a meat/cheese board, pickles and olives, etc. They also ran out of chips on a Saturday night! Definitely wasn't a fan of the food menu....but it didn't ruin the overall experience and I would go back to try more games!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with a Meetup group.  We were all excited as few , if any , of us had been to this location.  Disappointment crept up soon though.  First the staff seemed harried and uninterested in providing quality service.  No separate bills? Technology to do this has been around for decades.    Also, I'm still on quest to get my long lost potato jackets.  Ordered them, 45 minutes later the server tells me that they're unavailable? !  Thanks for the update.  So glad I spent minimal money at this establishment.    On the upside, my beer was cold and wet.  Guess they got that right."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Snakes & Lagers.  Our server Amanda was amazing, she walked us through how to play the games we chose, and although the place got a bit busy by the evening, Amanda came back and checked in on us from time to time.  It is a great place to spend time with friends, can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Great idea, but these types of places are always busy (since people stay for very long times). wait times can vary from 45-1.5 hours, and it's really not worth it. This is a smaller venue, and therefore a longer wait time. If you have a friend live downtown, just play board games at their place, because I honestly dont think it's worth the wait, especially in winter."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of board game cafes and beer so I gave Snakes & Lagers a try. I've been there few times now and actually ended up liking it.  There is a small cover of $5 but I think it's better than some other cafes that charge more.  Games: Compared to it's predecessor, Snakes and Lattes, the game selection is much smaller. The cafe has two floors, so the  already small selection is divided between the two floors.   Staff: All the staff I've encountered are very friendly and service is quick. The last server was extremely friendly and truly enjoyed his job. He was very enthusiastic to teach us his favourite games.   Food/ Drinks: The food selection is limited and comes in small portions. Nonetheless, I actually like their food, especially the small burger sliders. They are somewhat pricey for their portion size though.  They have some decent beer selection.   Overall, I like this place and will probably go back to it."}
{"text":"My friends and I had the best time! The food was great. The choices of IPA  beers were fun. We had a blast with the games. The service was super friendly. One of our favourite places in the T."}
{"text":"Great people working there but there is a big big BIG and unavoidable BUT.  First off we went at 730 and they initially said an hour and a half, but due to our experience at Snakes & Lattes we kinda figured it would be a bit more. We ended up waiting 3.5 hours, but whatever, good for them they run a sought after venue. Not to mention the hostess was very polite and forgiving and gave us more time than she initially said.  So the staff is incredibly nice and the drink menu has a good selection of beers at a comparable price (7$), nothing else is that great at all. The food was delicious but stupid expensive, the sliders were 3 for 15$ and when the first one came I was incredibly disappointed. They were marginally bigger than a toonie. I kinda forgave it because the food was delicious, but I still felt ripped off.  Then we decided to choose a game and yet again the staff was great and recommended a fun game, but after we tired of it, had very little choices. Lots of shelving, no selection. Can be forgiven as they've existed for about 2 weeks at this point.  Then the bill came and we realized \"holy mackerel! I not retract everything I just forgave you for because you just charged 5$ a head just to enter the place, and you really had nothing to back that cover up with\".  TLDR: INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED. No game choice. Good beer. Nice staff. Overhyped. LONG WAIT."}
{"text":"This is an amazing idea and I'm so glad this place exists.  If you love games, this is a great place to try out new ones. If you like going out with friends, this is a place you can actually talk to each other.  We sat at a two person table on the first floor I actually liked that the servers weren't on top of us the whole time. It would be hard to spend 4 hours paying games if they came by too much because I would always feel like I had to order more because I'm taking up a table.  We came right after an Indian buffet lunch, so we didn't get any food but I LOVE that they label the vegan items (why isn't your falafel vegan?) on the menu and almost order some for just that reason.   I had the Corpse Reviver #2 cocktail and really liked it. I took one sip and said, \"this was worth ten bucks!\"  We played Lost Cities and Cold War, both of which were very fun. I think I'm going to buy the latter as a result. I've been looking for more two player games, so this was perfect.   Get there early! We were in by 4pm no problem but soon saw lots of folks being told there's a wait. People are playing games, so you never know when they'll leave."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience here. It has a good beer selection, but the prices are generally high for food and drink.  More importantly, it charges a $5 cover for, frankly, a miserable game selection. Don't expect a Snakes & Lattes grade collection - no Carcasonne, Catan, Dominion, Lords of Waterdeep. Why? \"We're a bar.\" (???) What, tipsy folks don't like good games???  I love Snakes & Lattes, but if you're here for games and beer, I can't recommend Snakes & Lagers until they level up their games collection and approach."}
{"text":"Alcohol is a bit expensive but it's still fun. The atmosphere is quite \"hipster\". They don't have as many games as Snakes and Lattes. The bartender and waitresses were very nice. It's an awesome place, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Im giving this 1 star because im not allowed to give 0.  If you're planning on going there tonight beware the super bitchy hostess. She'll make u wait 10 mins just to tell u it's full and push u out of the doorway."}
{"text":"Looking to take it easy one night with some fiends, this is the spot, with the upstairs and huge selection of games ana afair price (5$ pp) to play its not a bad deal, pint of beer cost about the same as a bar (7$) and u won't be drinking no run of the mill old boring beer, all local mostly micro brewery's.  the one table we got was wobbly, as that was very annoying, and no we couldn't put some thing under the leg, the entire table was broken, small things like this need to be fixed. Staff was very  knowledgable, on both games, drinks, and rules.  I would come back for sure, hope some more effort is made to \"clean\" up the place and fix the little issues."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday at 6 pm.  No line-up, lots of tables to choose from.  The lady suggested we (2 people) sit downstairs but the downstairs sucks.  Go upstairs, despite what they say (we then moved upstairs when we realized it was better up there).  They let the two of us sit at a four person table (not a booth), so we could hoard some games on the table.  I liked the service, the drinks and surprisingly REALLY liked the food.  We were there for 4 hours and the entire thing cost $60.  That's with entry for two ($5 each), three drinks each, three sliders, edamame and popcorn.  I didn't like that the popcorn was 80% kernels.    I think the game selection is much better for groups of 4, it was mostly larger groups there (4-6 people).  I would go back again for a second or third date with someone (that getting to know you phase when it's good to do an activity), or if I went with a group of friends.  I liked the atmosphere better than Snakes & Lattes, but the game selection is much, much weaker.  That may be because they're trying to be a pub and not a games' place, but they are part of a known franchise and have expectations to live up to."}
{"text":"I was a tad disappointed with the variety of games. It's quiet and not as packed as snakes and lattes, but even then food menu is limited but they do have quite a bit of variety for the alcohol. If you like a big variety of games, snakes and lattes is the place to be. Other than that, the server was friendly, knowledgeable with the games and came to check up on us often to see if we needed anything or help with clarifying instructions. Small but two floors."}
{"text":"Never been here but the fact that they don't have a phone number listed on their website or otherwise really irks me. Just because you don't take reservations, it doesn't mean that people should not have any means of contacting the place other than on foot."}
{"text":"A great extension of the 'Snakes and Lattes' brand. Had a great time there the other night. The locations game selection is not up to par with 'Lattes', but I'm sure that will change over time.   And what they don't have in games they make up for with super friendly staff and surprisingly delicious sliders. Like, really, really good sliders. And there's a bar!   Pro-tip: They also have 6-person tables!"}
{"text":"$5 cover gives you access to a wide variety of board/card games, and a good beer selection @ $7 a pint, including a rotating tap with IPAs, porters and a decent enough selection to satisfy most beer lovers. It's a good venue for a chill night, or a start what could a crazier night.   Service is a tad slow if you're sitting upstairs, but it's not really an environment where you're chugging your drinks (well, I suppose it could be... with all the games they offer. Just wait until the Asians find out about this place! Yes, I'm Asian, and I readily admit that although we have a low tolerance on average, we love our drinking games. If I were the marketing manager here actually....the possibilities are endless! sidenote: S&L owner, if you want some marketing tips, give me a shout!)  If you REALLY want to drink faster, well, just double your order when the server does come by. Problem solved. (and that's why my nickname is \"problem solver\". But you can call me PS).  I don't know what games they have to be honest, we were playing Cards Against Humanity all night. Some other table was playing \"Sorry\". And \"sorry\" I don't remember what other tables were playing, but I'm sure you can scroll through other reviews...  All in all, I enjoyed my night and I'd come back for the games and drinks - it's good for what it is, and different than other Toronto bars.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is the food menu didn't look to good, though I have to admit I didn't try anything off the menu."}
{"text":"tried to go here tonight with some friends. was told there's at least a 3 hr wait. They don't have any type of wait list or anything, so theres not really any way to wait for a table. we were told by a rude server that we need to just come back in a couple of hours, he didnt specify how long, making it quite hard for us to know when exactly to come back.   We ended up grabbing a bite to eat and arrived back at their door in approx 2hours, was told that there was still no room. the server we spoke to was smug, rude, and had horrible customer service. We were basically told that tonight was not our night. Didn't offer any apologies or anything.   Based on my experience here, I don't think I\"ll ever visit again. If you know you're a busy place, start some type of waitlsit, people will come back if they know they have a chance of getting a table. Being smug, snobby, and rude to your potential customers is only gonna drive them away."}
{"text":"Great beer, fun time, but I wish there was more selection on their food menu.  Went on a weeknight, and luckily the rest of the group got there first so we didn't have to wait for a table. The six of us were seated upstairs, which has a really nice cozy feel.The beer selection is great, and they have cider on tap (that isn't strongbow) so that's a plus for me. We ordered some of the sliders; the petit mac, the pork belly banh mi and the falafel.  The pork belly was delicious with a generous amount of sauce, which is key. The petit mac did taste exactly like a big mac (although I could have gone for more of a big mac portion) and the falafel was a meh. I've eaten falafel at some really great middle eastern restaurants lately so my expectations have risen above bland and and rubbery. Other people at our table got the fried brussel sprouts and really enjoyed them as well. All in all it was pretty decent, but I still think 6 bucks a slider is pretty steep, even with the 3 for 15 combo.  Service was pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable of the beer menu. My only complaint is that they do all their ordering/adding up on a tablet, so I never actually saw a bill, she just told us what our total was and we forked over the money...which means later on I was still mentally adding up our bill in  my head making sure that everything worked out. Also, just an fyi there is a $5 dollar fee per person for the games.  The place itself is pretty loud, since people get REALLY into the games they're playing. But frankly that just adds to the fun environment. I'd definitely go here again...I just might eat something else first."}
{"text":"if i can give it negative stars, i would, the service was beyond terrible.we were group of 10. when i first arrive already they demand charging 20% mandatory tips, saying \"it was just easier\". And i believe the signaled the whole night, basically we spent a whole night trying to chase down a server, and when we became desperate enough to ask other servers to help, we got big attitudes from all of them. The things we asked for either didn't come, or was wrong. This is what happens when you guarantee tips. they stop trying.   the food we had like burger salads, and friend cheesecake, was also terrible. the burger was overcooked beyond belief, the salad unbelievability can be screwed up and had a weird smell. and the cheeesecake was just a piece of bread covering.   when it was board game time, when we asked any server to explain the game, they all gave us attitude, and just said they were busy and stated standing in a corner checking their smartphones all night.   Overall i would suggest people to avoid this place completely. no point in spending money on a place that to begin with has very little game selection. terrible service.   just go to other board game cafes."}
{"text":"So here's the constructive feedback, verbatim, that I provided to the Snakes and Lagers staff a couple weeks ago. I meant it in the spirit of improving what I think is a pretty cool idea for a bar, but unfortunately they didn't see fit to respond in any way (despite their executive chef taking the time to check out my profile on LinkedIn the day I sent the email), so am sharing it for the wider community's reference.   \"Dear Snakes and Lager staff, I'm very sorry to say that the food we partook of at your fine establishment last evening was really, really not good. Like, really not good.   My issues specifically were:  1) Sweet Bar Nuts - In the menu these are listed as 'Roasted peanuts, sunflower seeds, pecans, almonds, and walnuts. Candied with melted sugar, butter, and house seasonings' But there was not a speck of sugar or candy-ing that was happening there. There was however such a volume of cayenne pepper and other \"hot\" spices so as to both make said spices downright scoopable, and to render the nuts inedible.   2) Flank Steak and Fries - In the menu this is described as 'Dry rubbed flank steak, butter-fried with herbs and double smoked bacon. Served with duck fat frites and sage demi glaze.' Unfortunately, the portion size was shockingly small. Shockingly. The flank steak was fatty but cooked well, the bacon yummy. However, instead of duck fat frites I got Yuca fries that were both cold, and had obviously spent enough time prior to their cooling in the oven that they were literally hard as rocks. Molar strength required! Insane crushing sounds ensued!   3) Roast Vegetable Pot Pie - the filling was yummy, the \"puff\" pastry crust was leaden  I love your joint, I do. I had a great time. The beers are great! The staff friendly. The game selection outstanding. But you have a long way to go before the terms \"gastro-pub\" and \"sumptuous foods\" -- which figure on your marketing materials -- can move beyond aspirational goals to stand as accurate descriptions.\"   Overpriced and poor food. Stick to the beers (not $10 cocktails) and games and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you how it was.  They tell everyone it's a 45min to an hour wait.  After sitting at the bar an hour, we wernt even close.   And as new people came in droves, there were all given the standard 45-an hour.  Good beer tap selection though."}
{"text":"Great concept for a pub, and a wide variety of beer to try out. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the different board games and drinks available.  However, the variety of board games is regrettably small. Maybe it's because I'm a frequent patron of Snakes & Lattes and their huge library of games, but Lagers didn't even have Monopoly for Christ's sake! I understand that the place opened just a few weeks ago, but I would hold off on going for another month or two until the place builds up its library.  The prices for the food and drinks is a bit on the high side, and when I went (a Saturday evening), the place was jam-packed. There is a seating limit of 6, and they don't take reservations, so those are two low points.  This place has very high potential, but it needs a bit more time to reach it."}
{"text":"I've been going to snakes and lattes for years and when I found out they opened a Snakes and Lagers location I was excited. Though they have a small selection of board games, I prefer this location because of the ambiance and more intimate. They have a great selection of craft beer on tab, and my personal favorite: A rotating selection of Unibroue beers."}
{"text":"I get why people love this place. It sells beer and has games.  Here is why it sucks though:  1) long wait. There is a very long wait, no reservations and no system wherein they call you when a table is ready.    2) they lie. If you show up, you may be told that there is no standing room to wait.  If so, you should call back in half an hour to see if there is standing room.  However, I did call, was there within 5 and told that there was no standing room.   If you are willing to show up, wait for the opportunity to wait indoors while checking in occasionally by phone to play some games, then this is for you.    It is fun if you can get in.  Go right at 4 when they open, then spend your evening elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pros: Decent beer list. Better than most places. Games. Food was okay. But expensive.  Cons: I order my first beer, from the same server, three times. It took 20 minutes. And it was served at the wrong temperature. They knew how many people were in our party, yet moved us because of \"fire regulations\" twice. They brought us the wrong beers, twice. Rather than comp them, they took them back and replaced them. (Hope they poured them, and didn't reserve them. They added 18% gratuity to the bill, which is posted nowhere, and then didn't mention it...perhaps hoping for a tip on top of it. The games weren't well-maintained. They were dirty. CaH was full of repeat cards."}
{"text":"Undetermined waiting time for a table (was told 2 hrs, but when they called after 1.5 was only given 10 mins to return); not allowed to have more than 6 ppl - though automatic gratuity is added to all bills of \"6 OR MORE people\"; $5 cover; over priced food and drinks and, most importantly SERIOUSLY lacking in the game selection = not a fan of this new place.  Great concept but until they build their game selection I'm not going to bother giving this place another try.  It's not worth the wait and $5 cover when there are plenty of other pubs that have games for free."}
{"text":"Selection is slightly more limited than Snakes and Lattes, but the atmosphere is the same...very friendly servers and excellent drink selection. I highly recommend doing the beer tasting option...very nice selection of beers and you could even ask them to \"surprise you\" ;) $5 cover charge still applies. Food wise, I was very happy with the lager burger!  Great option for games and drinks."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you want to have some fun and a good laugh with a few friends on a weekend night over some nice beer. However, if you are more into hard core board games like me, it is recommended to go to their sister lounge Snakes & Lattes instead.   Drinks: Their beers on tap is quite abundant, and the waitress are usually clever enough to always ask if one wants another beer. They will also accommodate non-alcoholic drinkers with mocktails as needed.  Games: As for the board games they have, it's more of the \"just for laughs\" board games, such as \"Cards against Humanity\". They have at least 5 copies of it on the shelf when we were there. The heaviest strategy game we found was \"Ticket to ride\". The difference between here and Snakes & Lattes, is there's no Game Specialist to walk around to ensure everyone's okay. We were there for a good 5 hours on a Saturday evening, and other than the waitress, no one came by to check up on us. But the games are fairly simple overall, and can be figured out from the rule book. Though if they can have rule books that aren't falling apart, that would be great...  Overall Atmosphere: If you want a nice conversation with your friends, this place is not for you. Throughout the night, it gets louder and rowdier as more people get drunk and are having a good laugh. The tables and chairs are all wooden, so it can be hard to sit on.   3/5 would go there again if I want a drink with some friends, but 5/5 would go to Snakes & Lattes instead for board games selection."}
{"text":"Came here on a recent visit to Toronto and had a great time! Ken/Kevin was really nice, and very helpful in regards to beer choices. We didnt have anyone teach us any games so im not sure if they do that, but they can definitely recommend something for however many of players you have. The food was great too although my sandwich which was supposed to be on focaccia bread was actually just served on a bun. It was still delicious and I only realized it after a couple of bites so i didn't see the point in complaining. We also tried out snakes and lattes which has a bigger selection of games, but we liked it better here. Just wish we had something like this in NYC!"}
{"text":"#BOARDGAMES #TORONTO #YELP  Nothing like Snakes & Lattes, which will always be my favorite. \"Lagers\" is for the people who always complained about the restricted alcohol at \"Lattes\" - also for the group that considered \"Lattes\" too geeky. This one's a pub that offers a smaller choice of boardgames to enjoy with the drinks whilst \"Lattes\" is more of boardgame hub, food and drinking aside.   So, why this one got a 3 star?  - Pricey! Cocktails are $10+ and the space looks nothing like a space where that kind of prices are justified. Also, tiny portions.   - Smaller collection of board games, plenty of Cards Against copies, though!  - Less cozy and fun, more intimate and romantic.  - Servers serve. They don't come by to explain games to you.   - People playing games at the bar. Not the greatest thing for a private group. Kind of weird.  Things that work?  - First floor is a 2 people area with more 2 people games and second floor is meant for bigger groups.   - Doesn't get as crowded as the one on Annex; no waiting lists! Atleast we didn't have to on a Saturday evening.  - The usual hipster feel.  Verdict? Despite the 3 stars, I'd actually consider coming back."}
{"text":"Lucky me, I had the pleasure of checking out Snakes & Lagers on one of their preview nights, prior to their official grand opening. Giddy with excitement, I walked through the doors to some very welcoming staff. Note, similar to Snakes & Lattes, there is a $5 cover fee.  Snakes & Lagers may appear a bit small on first glance, however, not to fret, there is a second floor full of gaming goodness upstairs.  Since this was a preview night, they did not have their full library of games, but still had a nice array of awesomeness to choose from. We spent most of the evening playing Ticket To Ride & King of Tokyo. The awesome staff that I previously mentioned, will happily provide you with a walkthrough of how to play a game if you have never played it before, or just need a quick refresher.  The food here kicks some serious butt. I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food, and the nice variety offered! Mostly they serve tapas and snack style foods, but the tapas are quite large (for the sandwiches, wraps, etc. think bigger than a slider, but smaller than a full sized sandwich.) We tried the lettuce wraps (GIANT meat portions in these bad boys,) the Mini Mac (exactly what you think it is, but more delicious), the Fried Brussel Sprouts (we DEVOURED two cast iron skillets of these, which were EXTREMELY delicious and well seasoned), the Duck Fat Spiced Popcorn (on the house, and addictive,) and the charcuterie board (standard charcuterie, in my opinion).  In addition to the savoury, we decided to pick up and taste test a few desserts. All of their \"pies\" are served in mason jars, and are extremely cute & well presented. Delicious. The mason jars were not filled for long. While their desserts rotate, we tried the mud pie & lemon meringue. They also have these rediciously soft and delicious cookies (that have a special name I can't remember :(). We went with a butterscotch and BACON that was super tasty!  By the time we left, our tummies were full, and we were happy campers.  I'm super excited to come back here for some tipsy board gaming shenanigans :)."}
{"text":"I've been to this new location a couple times, and it's nice to see the S&L team expanding their locations and options.    Snakes & Lagers, as evidenced by their name, adds a large beer selection to their offerings.  I'm not a beer snob, but I'd like to go there with a friend who is to see how they like it.  The game library is a bit smaller, which is unfortunate.  There's still a large selection, but you're not likely to find a hardcore Eurogame or quirky independant game.   The food is a delight.  Both times I've gone I've had the slider platter.  The Buffalo Chicken & Mini Mac are both tasty, but the Banh Mi pork belly slider is delicious.    Acoustically, it's rough, but that may be because we were next to a double table playing Cards Against Humanity."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday for the first time. The servers were very friendly and they seem to have an extensive knowledge of the board games available. The cover is 5 dollars per person and 18% of service fees (tips) if you bring six or more people. The beers they have are affordable (6-7 dollars). I haven't tried any of the food yet but the portions seems average (as seen from a friend's dinner).  There are two places to get board games, downstairs and upstairs. Each is labelled with a difficulty. Most people that came in groups seem to like cards against humanity (but they have like 6-7 boxes of those, so there is enough to go around).   Overall, it was a good experience just drinking and having a good time with friends over an old fashion board game. Seems like a good place to hangout after a long week.  Tips:  - Come early to avoid the long wait. - Six people is just right, bring seven people and there will be an odd man sitting where people would have to walk, which is annoying - Ask the server for the guest beer (the raspberry beer was good) - Try not to hate your friends"}
{"text":"Beer + Snacks + Boardgames = Fun Afternoon  I had so much fun with my coworkers, there's really nothing bad I can say about this place. The only down part that I could think of is that it was freezing in that building! Other than that, it's definitely a great place to spend several hours playing games with friends."}
{"text":"Smelled of mold.   Walked in on a first date. Place came highly recommended. Unfortunately it stunk of mildew or mold. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love their drinks menu, and their snacks are well-made but pricey. I've had a few cocktails and they were expertly made. Their draft list is almost exclusively local craft beer.   The games they have available are very focused on \"parties\"; they're easy to learn and play, and most take only 30-45 minutes to play. They don't have any of the most popular but complex games like Catan or Risk. For those, you will need to go to Snakes and Lattes. It's too bad, cause I would prefer the drinks menu at the Lagers location, and the games list at Lattes."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere. $5 cover to play board games which is awesome.  One complaint. I asked our server about whether the fried Brussels sprouts were good or not. She said yes, so I ordered them.  When we got them, we tried them and it tasted like charcoal or the bottom of your grill. We sent them back and she said unfortunately we are still going to be charged for it. Which was fine. However, she added in, I disagree with you.  Being a server myself, regardless or not if I agree with the guest, I will try to make that guest happy. She just seemed kind of standoffish, kind of trying to get us to settle up our bill and just being subtlely rude.  I recommend this place for its concept, not so much its service."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being invited to review Snakes and Lagers after they opened back in February. If you are unfamiliar, Snakes and Lagers is the sister bar to the popular Snakes and Lattes cafe. Targeted towards a different crowd, Snakes and Lagers aims to be that perfect get-together place for the after-work crowd. As a pub, they offer a variety of alcoholic beverages with five rotating taps as well as a small range of appetizers and desserts to munch on. They also have seasonal drinks that come and go.  Snakes and Lagers sometimes collaborates with other places, such as the Black Oak Brewing Company for board game nights. Although game events do not happen as often as they do at Snakes and Lattes, there are some already planned, such as the Euchre tournament in the next couple of months. Snakes and Lagers plans on having only 300 board games, in contrast to Snakes and Lattes, which has a total of 1500.  The drink I had was the Brasseurs RJ Cheval Blanc. It's a light, smooth, beer with no aftertaste. Great for those who are light drinkers and don't like the heavy bitter taste of beer. I also got to try their popular Fried Brussel Sprouts and Duck Fat Fries (with an additional $1 if you would like dipping sauce, which is a must have! I loved all three sauces). When my boyfriend and I were recommended the Fried Brussel Sprouts, I was unsure because they were just vegetables. However, they were the pub's specialty so my boyfriend decided order a plate. I was pleasantly surprised because they were great! I liked how they were seasoned which definitely made for a nice appetizer that didn't taste like boring ol' brussel sprouts. A warning though is that Snakes and Lagers only offers appetizers and small-sized portions. There won't be any big burgers with fries on the side like most places.  When I arrived, it was around 5 PM and it wasn't too busy. After a couple of hours, it started to pack up with those coming in after work, ready to unwind and have a relaxing time playing games with friends. I definitely recommend Snakes and Lagers for an alternative to Snakes and Lattes. It's not as intense with the board game aspect like the cafe, for example, there is no Game Master (although the staff is knowledgeable and would be more than happy to help). Additionally, the game selection is not as massive if you want a wider range. The $5 sitting fee still applies to the pub like it does at the cafe though."}
{"text":"Not a lot of GF option but the homemade ice cream was awesome!  Server was knowledgeable and bar was stocked.  White Russian was not the best... Stick to beer and bar rail mixes.  One copy of Catan... No Star Trek version :("}
{"text":"On the menu is a whole lot of friendly. The staff sure are. Clients too. Oh and there are games, treats such as duck fat fries, falafel sliders, and great beer. I'm looking forward to coming again especially in summer as the back patio that I've enjoyed in the past is one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Snakes and Lattes OR snakes and lagers... I always find myself debating.. It's nice to have drinks and awesome apps to nibble on, but the selection for game is just soooo limited.   They charge 5$ cover but the drinks really add up!!! The cocktails are a hefty $10 and it comes in a cup equivalent to a tim horton's small coffee."}
{"text":"Really cool idea, but executed poorly. It took FOUR hours to get a table. They also tried to charge us for a round of drinks that never arrived (we left the table because we were tired of waiting even longer for drinks). The most popular game, Cards Against Humanity, was wanted by the whole pub and most never got it at their table. The staff was stressed and over worked- I hope they got some tips at least! Food was decent. Decor was very bare and there was no music playing. An odd ball of a place but despite having a bad time, I hope it buckles down and succeeds!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friends today and had a very pleasant experience.  We went in at right as it opened at 2pm and stayed until around 8. They have such a wide variety of amazing games that we completely lost track of time. They have a very good selection of local beers on tap that we all enjoyed along with some food as well. Even though we stayed there for 6 hours,  we were never rushed or pressured into ordering more food or drinks, however our server still came by to check on us to see if we wanted anything (the frequency was higg enough to not be ignoring us, but low enough to jot be pressuring us). Even through there was am amazing atmosphere and beer selection, I was slightly disappointed by the food (as we're my friends).  The avocado frites left me wanting more and my friend was disappointed by his porkwich sandwich (he did really like the fries that were served with it).   I would definitely visit here again if I had the time and would recommend it to others, but would suggest eating elsewhere beforehand.  With regards to the $5 cover, we were clearly informed about it when we first sat down,not sure how cone others on here were not told about it."}
{"text":"One of my volleyball teams decided to check this place out on an off night and we had a great time. We showed up just after 7pm on a Thursday night and even though it was busy, we didn't have to wait to get a table for 4. We went through quite a few rounds of drinks and we tried a few of the sliders and an order of the fries. Nothing bad to say about the big mac, the pork belly or the fried chicken sliders except they were all a bit messy. The fries were also really good but had cheese sprinkled on them which just ended up on the table. It seems a little odd to me that all the food is really sloppy at a place where you've got board games and cards all over the table. We played a few games with regular cards, a game of Ghost Blitz and went through the whole deck of Cards Against Humanity and the service the whole time was really good.  Pints were fairly priced at around $7, the sliders were 3/$15 and the $5 cover charge for the games had the evening come out to about $50 after tax/tip. Not too bad for being there for almost 3 hrs.  I'd definitely go back but I'd maybe eat beforehand as the food there is mainly to snack on and not very filling. I'd also maybe stay downstairs if you can as the atmosphere at the bar seemed a lot brighter than upstairs."}
{"text":"Hundreds of games but no Skip-bo.  Hmm... I thought that game was a lot more common.    Generally, I like the idea.  There is a good selection of craft beer with a broad selection of beers.  No one hurries you and the service is good.  A fun way to spend a few hours with friends."}
