{"text":"Dad and I found this little old time fish camp gem on my last visit. Bring cash and an open mind, step back 40 years and relax.  Good sweet tea, fried fish with all the old time basics. Take a minute to read the history pages of the menu."}
{"text":"If you want fancy, this isn't your place. But if you want a casual dining experience with awesome food, this is a hidden gem!   You drive down a long gravel driveway into the middle of the woods to a rustic cabin \"aka fish camp\" locale.  The menu is made up of  southern home style yummy food like fried flounder, shrimp, deviled crabs, hush puppies, \"red\" slaw, collards, etc. They serve large portions for reasonable prices with friendly locals as your servers.   We love supporting local businesses - this \"fish camp\" has been family operated since 1962!   Have gone several times and experience remains consistent. Only downside is that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"One of the last old times fish camps left in our area.  It was traditional to go to the fish camp on the weekend growing up. The food is good, prices are good. You MUST read the history of this place that is with the menu. You won't believe it. Needs to be a movie!  One note- it is a cash only place. No debit/credit cards. It is very causal place. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Just what I've been looking for!  An old style Fish Camp!  We loved the food, it tasted great and was reasonably priced. PLUS they can do almost anything as gluten free!  I say again, this fish camp can do most of their fried seafood as gluten free!  That's REALLY hard to find."}
{"text":"Awesome! If you don't go you're missing out!!! Fish is great! Sides are great! Love the atmosphere! People are friendly"}
{"text":"Before I write the review, a friendly warning: this place is cash only, so be prepared. They need to put that on the door and on their website.   If you want fried fish, hushpuppies, fries, and slaw, and you are looking for the exact opposite of fancy, this is absolutely the spot for you. It's as unfancy as it gets, and that's a very large part of the appeal. It's old, it's small, it's down a gravel road, and it doesn't look like much from the outside (or the inside, for that matter). And those are all positives, not negatives. The food is good, and it's very reasonably priced. You might even say cheap. If you're a fan of whole fried catfish with the bones, get that. Otherwise, go for the fisherman's platter (fish, shrimp, and oysters).   Service is friendly and food comes out pretty quickly. It's also good for kids. Definitely worth a visit."}

{"text":"**This place is cash only**  Today I ventured into rural Cabarrus to try out a location that I have heard about for years but never tried.  I admit that I felt a little unsure about the place as we turned into the driveway.  The restaurant is small and rustic.  It's a throwback to the 60s and 70s.  I am so glad we went in and gave it a chance.  Below the cash register the sanitation grade was displayed.  They currently hold a 96!  That is good for an older building.  The dining area was dated but very clean.  I felt a sense of nostalgia by eating there.  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  The waitress brought us a menu that was a notebook.  The first two pages of the menu was the food and drink items.  The last three pages detailed the history of the business.  They even offer gluten free menu items.  I decided on the fried flounder with a side of okra and macaroni salad and hush puppies.  My wife got the Calabash shrimp with white slaw and onion rings.  We were both very happy with what we ordered.  My flounder was thick white meat cooked perfectly.  The wait staff was very attentive.  They looked out each other's tables.  We were well taken care of.  I can't wait to visit this little gem again! Don't be taken aback by it's small rustic appearance- the food is good."}
{"text":"Being from the North, I had never heard of a fish camp before so didn't know what to expect. With my wife being Celiac and GF, this place comes highly recommended from her Charlotte Celiac Connection. Almost everything is GF, pitchers of Sweet Tea, awesome hush puppies and amazingly fresh seafood!  A bit of a hike from my neck of the woods and only open Thursday- Saturday I think."}
