{"text":"Nice surprise. Wanted someplace quick and tasty before a movie at the Manor. Chicken Piccata was well prepared, veggies were nicely cooked and the service was attentive and friendly.  

Zio will be on my casual dining list. Decent price, good food, what's not to like."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian and pizza place. Top notch food and relaxed atmosphere. Kid friendly yet cozy. Probably the best pizza in CLT. Entrees and specials have been delicious each time we've tried them. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've recently relocated from upstate ny and have been super nervous to attempt pizza in Charlotte. I've never actually left a review for a place but this experience has been less than ideal. 

The first issue was that we ordered online. The confirmation email stated what time out order would be ready. Showed up within 5 mins of estimated time and they never took the order off the printer.  The only reason I didn't leave two stars is because there was a complimentary beverage for my friend for the inconvenience. 

I ordered the caprese salad- this was a nightmare. I order this type if salad most places I go and this was definitely quite disgusting. The tomato (or 2/3 of a tomato) I got had definitely been refrigerated for at least a few days. It was pale orange and mushy. There were also like three tiny halved cherry tomatoes of equal refrigeration tossed in. Strange. The dressing (oil and balsamic ) was left in separate containers to add in myself. The only issue is that the balsamic was the consistency of motor oil. Not ideal. 

We also ordered a plain pie. It was ok. Very very thin crust, a little undercooked on the bottom. 

Overall I would say I wouldn't waste my time here for the pizza and don't even think about wasting the $7 or so bucks on that caprese salad."}
{"text":"I'm still waiting for this place to disappoint me - have had nothing but AMAZING food and service here.  I had the Sausage and Red Pepper Grilled Pizza and it might be my new \"usual\".

Also, anything on their special list is worth trying.  Most recent visit, we had the Spanish Tapas (which was Chorizo and roasted potatoes with olives) and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, hands down.  We travel from across town to eat here, and Uncle Duff's pies never disappoint.  I prefer to sit to the left when you walk in.  Larger groups and families usually are seated to the right.  It's cosy and an overall great neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab authentic Italian food. This place is what Italian should be, affordable, comfort food. Italian food I have been told is basically the equivalent of soul food up north. Zio has a great family friendly atmosphere and even though I am not Italian it brings me a sense of comfort every time I dine there. The meatballs are always fresh and the sauce is perfect, not too sweet. An experienced waitstaff adds to the experience, service is always on point and you feel that you are dining at Cheers, where everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"Two friends and I decided to check out Zio since it was near the bar that we would be going to after for a football game! We had checked out the Yelp reviews before and were pleasantly surprised when we ordered and received our food.

We started with the calamari and it was amazing. We're pretty big sticklers on calamari but this one didn't disappoint. Next, I had the goat cheese/strawberry/mandarin orange salad dinner special and it was amaaaazing. The fried goat cheese was perfect and I was so happy I had ordered it.

My two friends both got really large pizzas for $11. They were really good also and we were all stoked on the great food we received. The prices are relatively inexpensive and the waiter was very friendly and was always attentive to us. I would definitely recommend Zio to anyone looking for quick, affordable and super yummy food!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian eatery, Great value for the restaurant location and food quality."}
{"text":"The special of: Corvina, sautéed spinach, rice and a perfect glass of wine was the best part of my Friday night. The food is delicious and the wait staff is both serious about the food and service. I also enjoyed the stuff mushrooms as my app. Neighborhood friendly (many who know one another) and friendly to newcomers as well. Casual style dining. And I noticed a lot of take out as well."}
{"text":"Just had the pizza but it was GREAT

Update: I've now tried a variety of dishes here and it never disappoints. I'm a true New Yorker and Italian food like this is hard to come by in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very tremendous. Absolutely delicious every time I go. In my top 3 of all Charlotte restaurants."}
{"text":"When to Zio for a quick dinner the other night. This was not my first time coming to Zio as it is one of the quicker casual Italian restaurants in Charlotte. We got the Eggplant Parmesan and the Baked Penne. Both dishes were great and the eggplant came with homemade fettucine. Coming from an Italian family and Italian restaurant family, I am usually quite critical of italian restaurants, but Zio has a traditional style. The server was very nice and friendly and tenative which also made the food that much better. Next time I will try the pies and pizza!

Tutti mangiamo!"}
{"text":"Eat here often, good price on speggetti and meatballs and house salad.  However, last time I had it, the meatballs had slipped in quality .. would prefer one that was high quality rather than two of average quality.  The salad remains good, and house dressing is good.  Portions large enough you take home for another meal (for many of the entree's).  Very family friendly, nice enough atmosphere, although the most recent time the booth was under repair and not comfortable. I would say it was better a year ago, but that's subjective. Hope it survives and thrives, as it is a nice family alternative Italian chain operations.  They tend to separate the families with kids from the others, they have two dining spaces.  That's good.  The salad wedge is wonderful, try that if you haven't. Not cheap, however."}
{"text":"Update: menu has changed over the years. Food is still good, but I miss the marinara mixed with pesto that used to be served with bread. Love the pizza. Desserts have gone downhill - most recent cannoli was terrible. 

Service has seemed really slow the past few times we've been. There isn't a reason a pizza dinner should be 2+ hrs long - it was very frustrating, this place may turn into a takeout only choice."}
{"text":"Likes: Good neighborhood location, decent food with fresh herbs used from their own garden located behind the restaurant and good prices 

Gripes: Service is mediocre, tends to be too hot in the restaurant in the summer and cold during the winter and the booths are uncomfortably small"}
{"text":"The place was rather crowded when we got there, especially for a Monday night, and they were understaffed, so rather than wait twenty minutes for a table, we sat at the bar, which was an excellent choice.  The bartender was GREAT, there were lots of open seats, and there was a baseball game on the flatscreen in the corner.

There's bread to start with a choice of butter or red pepper pesto, which tasted like marinara to me.  We both ordered salads and pasta dishes.  My companion cleaned both his plates and said the lasagna was very good.  I ordered a avocado, tomato, and mozarella salad special which was DELICIOUS.  I also got the baked ziti, which was nicely seasoned and huge enough that I ate it for dinner the two nights afterwards too.  The food was moderately priced for the quality.

Another shout out to the bartender is well deserved.  He was attentive without being overbearing and was great to chat about baseball with.  He also deftly handled the bar customers and all the take-out orders.  I didn't catch his name, but I get the feeling he's there a lot and his long ponytail makes him pretty identifiable.

Long story short: go to Zio!  Tasty food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Thursday evening..service was horrible, didn't even bother to ask if we wanted a salad, served coffee that was cold--twice! 
Meat sauce was dry and lasagna was all cheese, very little sauce. Overall very disappointed in our meal. Will try one more time since In the past food and service were good."}
{"text":"As I was eating the pizza (or 'hot pie' as they call it) I told my husband that I was never eating pizza anywhere else again!  It was SO GOOD!!  I will definitely be going back.  The only bad thing is we have had bad service twice (as in waiting a long time for someone to get our drink order) but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Zio is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Charlotte. Good food, good service and convenient.  I've usually get the lasagna, chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti ala Zio. My only disappointment was that I got the baby arugula salad that is supposed to come with grilled asparagus on it and the salad only had two small pieces of asparagus. Definitely wasn't worth the $7 for the salad."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place while in town for a conference and stopped in for dinner. What an amazing find. Warm, friendly, family-style Italian place. The home-made pasta was tremendous, as was the Chicken Parmesan... After, I had a cannoli, which was also excellent.  Highly recommended for anyone who craves an easy-going, well-made Italian dinner..."}
{"text":"Great food.  The pizza was perfect and the salad was excellent.

The service was HORRIBLE!  

We got our food before our drinks arrived.  My friend ordered another glass of wine throughout our meal, and had to remind the server about it twice.  

We got our bill, which was not ours.  No big deal.  We then got our bill ($44) and included a credit card along with $30.  The server took it without listening to us and came back with change and the card.  We explained we wanted her to run $14 on the card.  She took the card back, then proceeded to take an order on the phone as well as chat with the bartender.  Once I made a comment to the owner, we finally got our bill thrown to us as she stormed off.

There are plenty of restaurants that need our business.  Obviously, this is not one of them.  We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent 
Food perfection
Service Delightful 
Wine list good
Would defiantly would return and recommend to all"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I love the family/casual atmosphere.  The knowledgeable and friendly staff treat us like family.  
  The menu is diverse and every dish is great.  Eat here...you'll come back again and again."}
{"text":"I lived across the street from Zio for two years.  Literally a stone's throw = I've been there several times.

Likes:  The harvest salad!, casual and friendly atmosphere, good prices.

Dislikes:  The rest of the food I've had there is decent, but didnt blow me away.

Take it or leave it:  Take it if you're looking for a friendly and local Italian place.  Prices are really good for Myers Park.  Get the harvest salad."}
{"text":"Got another best pizza ever tonight!! Perfect crust, sauce, and just the right amount of cheese! Perfect!! The people who work there are great too!!!"}
{"text":"Usually no complaints here but tonight we called in an order and was told it would be 20mins. We arrive a little after the 20min mark and it's not ready. Took them over 40 mins to get out food ready. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Staff has changed and not for the better.  Gave it a couple of try's after I noticed a change but the friendly staff has been replaced by people that act like they hate being there and it is reflected in the quality of the food as well."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it was Five Steps Down. I haven't been there since.

I decided to give Zio a try for takeout a few weeks ago. My wife and I agree that they have some of the best pizza in town. 

Perfect size for a larger appetite: 12\" pizzas.

The salads are OK, nothing great. But the pizzas are awesome. 

Like Five Steps, it has that hidden neighborhood gem feel to it."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with a few fellow Yelpers....man, this place is the real deal! My husband and I definitely enjoyed mapping out our most recent Italian vacation on the place mats they have on the tables!

Pro tip- Tuesday is 1/2 wine bottles. Our table split some Pinot Grigio and Prosecco. 

Off of Yelper Tonya P's suggestion, we ordered a cheese pizza as a tizer. I honestly don't know if I would have done this if Tonya didn't encourage it. However, I now am going to recommend this to everyone! Order the cheese pizza. Not a bunch of rando toppings on it. Just cheese. It's that amazing. 

I settled on a side ceasar salad and a side of meatballs. My husband got the special for the day, which was angel hair pasta with a butter/white wine sauce and loads of seafood (shrimp, scallops, etc). His pasta was fantastic!! The shrimp in it were the jumbo shrimp, not the wimpy baby ones! My meatballs were easily the highlight for me. The flavor was so perfect. Everyone around the table seemed very pleased with their dishes! 

We decided to split a few desserts for the table. I tried a bite of the cannoli (excellent filling), a bite of the tiramisu, and a bite of this lemoncello cake (perfection!). 

Absolutely fantastic evening that was made even better by service. Our waitress may have actually been the sweetest woman on the planet. No exaggeration. Zio will definitely become our go to Italian from here on out."}
{"text":"Great family place. Good food and wait staff. Grilled pizzas are excellent. Recommend them highly."}
{"text":"They've just got really tasty Italian food.  The pasta is delicious.  I've enjoyed their angel hair with vodka sauce and prosciutto a couple of times.  DX has enjoyed a few of their chicken entrees.  The dessert we tried was a cabernet/raspberry gelato, very refreshing, like a frozen sangria.  The first time we went the service was almost over the top friendly - the hostess, the waitress were just gushy. I think it was a Friday night.  We went again on a Saturday night with a slightly larger party and the service was a bit more absentee, seemed a bit more rushed, but honestly was not bad.  The prices are so reasonable, some dishes just under $10, most not over $20,  especially considering the quality of the food.  The ambiance is a bit on the casual side but really this is a superb Italian restaurant, great for a fun date or a family outing.  If you're not trying to pay extra for a dark secluded corner (not a lot of those here to be honest) then there's no reason to go anywhere else for delicious, reasonable Italian."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good, local Italian restaurant and we found it.  Zio was delicious!  Loved the sauce, portions were plentiful, and service was solid.  The cannoli were \"meh\" but everything else was excellent, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Grilled pizza, amazing! The whole cloves of garlic roasted on the margharita pizza are a treat as is the flaky, crispy, soft crust. Yeah, it's all those things at once. In warmer weather, enjoy the outdoor seating or in the cold, warm yourself inside with a superbly friendly staff. The one thing i warn about is the cake--an original recipe from Italy--as once you try it, you will have to have more. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A great little neighborhood place to run into for a quick, yummy dinner or lunch. Absolutely the best side salad I've ever had, very generous. I ordered a regular pizza, which was fine. But my husband got a pear gorgonzola pizza that was awesome. We both ended up eating his pizza! The pizzas are very big, so one is all you need for two people and you'll probably end up still taking some home. Which is great because it makes a delicious lunch, even cold. Good service, friendly staff. It was a little cold the night we were there, so take a sweater."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid spot.  Second-best Italian I've had in Charlotte (behind Mama Ricotta's).  

Pretty sweet setting, as well.  I dug the relatively casual vibe when I went.  And, restaurants in the Providence area all seem to have a pretty organic classiness to them.

I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"The old \"5 Steps Down\" location! Love it. Awesome neighborhood spot. Fantastic pizza every time I have been. Service is hit or miss - maybe a staffing issue not bad talent. Nonetheless everything I have had here is great. Half price bottles of wine couple week nights."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Zio. And I'm going to admit that I might have gone to the wrong restaurant (upstairs) before I made it here. Don't be like me. :) 

When I arrived there was already fresh bread and dips on the table. I'm a fan because they bring you two loaves of bread to start. Carbs are the way to my heart! I loved the red sauce that comes out for dipping! So good! 

For dinner I ordered the toasted ravioli and a meatball. The ravioli was just okay. I missed the filling and expected them to be a little hotter fresher from the kitchen. My friend said they were normally not as skimpy so perhaps I just had a bad batch. 

But the meatball was really good! I loved the flavors and the sauce. I could have just ordered these and been happy! 

Overall, it's A-OK in my book. And I'd be willing to give them another try!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for a late supper last night at Zio and had the lasagna which was as beautiful to look at as it was delicious.  The sauce was so fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly and layered with super thinly sliced meatballs and ground sausage and LOTS of cheese and was very, very yummy!  He had a bolognese dish with homemade noodles that were very good!  I also sampled a beef spiedies appetizer (thanks for the name fellow yelper!)  that was very tender and cooked and seasoned perfectly!  We enjoyed a beautiful deep purple blackberry gelato served with a flaky biscuit like pastry and strawberries (minus whipped cream at our request) as our dessert and LOVED it!

The ambiance is very unassuming yet quaint and the restaurant was full on a Wednesday night - always a good sign!  Our waiter was attentive and made some great suggestions and admissions of some menu items that were better than others in his opinion!  

A great first experience to Zio and I would recommend it and try it again!"}
{"text":"great place to grab really well prepared Italian food. they always have a great special running. The staff is very friendly and know the menu front to back. So if you want good Italian with out all the fuss check this place out."}
{"text":"After trying several times I finally got my chance to enjoy a meal here. I was delighted with the warm friendly ambience. The menu made everything sound incredibly delicious but having heard about their awesome Pizza I knew I had to try it. After a very tasty shrimp appetizer our Pizza arrived. There was no disappointment in what my expectations had been. I loved the thin crust and the balance between the cheeses and the vegetable toppings. Nothing overwhelmed but everything blended into the perfect combination. The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable and checked with us frequently for refills and feedback on our meal. I would love to come back and try some of their other entrees but it will be hard to resist the pizza!"}
{"text":"After being disappointed by several expensive Italian restaurants in a row, Zio knocked my socks off.  Great prices and the spiedies are where it's at if you happen to like beef and bread.  Hooya!"}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill and not sure if I'll be back. I think our waiter was high or just out of it as we would have to flag him down and he was bouncing all over the place. For lasagna and wine I can think of better places when service is factored into the equation."}
{"text":"Zio's has changed and not for the better. While the food is still good, they have reduced the portions significantly. The dinner entrees are less than lunch portions. This is ridiculous. When you order a dinner entree you expect a dinner portion. Their dinner pasta dishes arrive in lunch Size pasta bowls. We dined last evening with another couple . Two of us ordered pasta dishes and two ordered the vegetable plate special. The vegetable plate was extremely small. We left hungry and very disappointed. Zio's needs to serve dinner portions or inform and charge appropriately."}
{"text":"My favorite new neighborhood place for sure. I am not a fan of thick pizza, even coming from Chicago :) This place has amazing thin crust brick oven (smoky flavor and all) pizza. Service with a smile and very cozy. Its pretty casual, so great for family and friends. 

I'm looking forward to trying new items. The sauteed spinach pizza was amazing...even over pepperoni!"}
{"text":"Zio is the epitome of a neighborhood restaurant.  It is off the beaten path, a casual meeting place with outside seating.  Zio has a warm feeling when you walk in the door, I mean the whiff of garlic knocks you down, heat pouring out of the kitchen, it is very comforting.   Even if you haven't been there, you know you have found a gem.

I have been a couple of times with large groups, great for ordering a lot of food and eating family style.  I love ordering a large pizza for an appetizer. YUM cheese overcooked please.   I went for lunch once and they told me they didn't serve pizza at lunch, that was a little mind boggling.  

Maybe we should have our first 2010 CLT yelpers at Zio!!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place - was craving some pizza last night and had yet to try  Zio's since everytime I go I crave their yummy pasta dishes.  Plus I really needed to return the cake pans from the chocolate cake I had for my birthday for the last two years.  If you have not had the chocolate cake you have no idea what you are missing out on. The pizza was so good and the people are just awesome I feel very comfortable in this place."}
{"text":"Zio is a great place to get flavorful Italian food at a reasonable price with a reasonably priced glass of wine or beer to accompany the food. The best part about Zio is that their food is flavorful without being overly salty and heavy. Their past dishes are outstanding. Their pizza is top notch. The grilled pizza is a special treat with a thin crust that is crispy. It is also a great place to take a family with young children."}
{"text":"From the beginning of 2010 until around October 2010 I would have rated Zio somewhere between 4 and 5 stars.  This would have been based on excellent service, friendly responsive wait staff, great hostess and a consistently excellent range of food.  At the end of 2010 and then going forward something changed.  The quality of food preparation and the taste of the food during my last 4 visits has dwindled.  My wife and my sister feel the same.  We were all \"regulars\".  Now we're no shows.  Please fix whatever has broken and we'll return to what we once thought and raved about as the best in Charlotte. 

Very sad"}
{"text":"Don't get pizza from here unless you are prepared to hate any other pizza you eat forever. Papa johns in particular will taste like a mouthful of greasy cardboard compared to one of Zio's hot pies. 

Also half off on wine bottles Monday and Tuesday can't be beat."}
{"text":"Zio (which means uncle in Italian) is a fantastic AUTHENTIC ITALIAN restaurant nestled in a Myers Park strip mall.  The owners moved to Charlotte from upstate New York 5 years ago and their food is truly a reflection of their roots!  Simple, delicious sauces, fantastic pizza and the prices are ridiculous (Stuffed Eggplant Parmesan for $8.95!)  If you are in search of some REAL Italian food, you owe it to yourself to try this place out :-)"}
{"text":"Cozy and delicious!!! Their pizzas as well as their pasta dishes are out of this world. Love this place!"}
{"text":"On my Italian quest, I decided to give Zio a try with my 'I love pizza' 3 year old.  I tried the Grilled sweet sausage pizza because of the reviews and it was pretty darn good, but I wasn't a big fan of the grilled crust.  I think I will give it another try but go with the new york style."}
{"text":"This quaint little place is bursting with flavor! Fancy decor and ambiance are nice but don't do much for my taste buds. This place isn't much to look at but the sautéed spinach grilled pizza is crazy delish! The pasta dishes are also nice as are the waitstaff. We asked for sangria and they made it happen."}
{"text":"We had the veal Marsala and chicken parmesean after starting w calamari. All will bring us back again. My friend and I sit at the bar because John the bartender is stellar, cool and fun and his recommendations (wine and food) are great. The chicken parmesean was perfect..flavorful, I'm not sure which one I liked more the chicken parm or veal Marsala. The veal was succulent w the sweet Marsala sauce. The
 chicken parm spot on. Zio is a great neighborhood restaurant where you'll feel welcome. Come hungry and ull leave full and you should enjoy ur dining experience as its very comfortable !"}
{"text":"Our favorite local Italian restaurant in the area.  It's very casual and reasonably priced, but honestly the food and service to me are five stars.  The pizza and lasagna are our favorites, but there is always good specials as well.  I would recommend this to anyone and it is also probably worthwhile to point out the restaurant seems very kid friendly."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Italian restaurant. The pizza, chicken Parmesan, salmon Parmesan,spaghetti ala zio were all delicious. Each dish was flavorful and made us feel warm and cozy. I Will definitely be back for more yummy food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I don't come here more often (aside from input from my waist). Zio has that charm of an old school Italian restaurant in a big city basement and high quality food with great service. 

Started with the toasted ravioli which were crispy and savory, with a marinara that tasted homemade. For the main course, had the grilled pizza special, spicy chicken sausage with mushrooms. The flavor was awesome and the size + having it square cut allowed for a tasty cold breakfast the next day. 

Our waitress was super friendly and very attentive without hovering. Only negative was the outside seating was closed for a \"private party,\" but the inside was quaint and cozy enough to make up for it. 

That's amore!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner and we had a great time! The service was excellent and they were heavy on their wine pours (hear 1/2 off bottles on Tuesday!). I started with the fried goat cheese salad- note you can have them split it for you. The goat cheese was delicious and the perfect starter to any meal. I would definitely come back just to order the salad. 

We decided to split a pizza. We did a BYO with the white pizza, but added chicken and artichokes. It was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Next time I'll definitely get a pizza down the traditional route, but the white pizza sold me.

Zio is a great place for a casual night out and the staff is super friendly. I will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"This quaint place is awesome!  It's clearly a neighborhood hang out but even though we are not regulars we were treated as such.  Classic Italian fare, like Italian in the 90's.  family atmosphere but only on one side other side is more adult.
Always great service, I mean always and awesome food, give them a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Usually Zio would get 4 stars from me... If I had only gotten the Speedies, Zio would be getting 5 yelp stars Today!  Last night as usual the Speedies were fast and great ,Perfect, really!  The House made Fetticunni was very good, though the Marinara was way too watery and not as rich in flavor as it is sometimes.  The service was great!  

The dessert was Chocolate Cake made in house I'll rate the cake at 1.5 yelp stars to be generous!  Of course I would return because it has been so good in the past and this place has great potential to be romantic!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I'm going to be completely honest, I'm 100% biased to it because the original restaurant is actually from my hometown, from which I grew up 2 miles from. Not only the authentic recipes are the same from this little Upstate, New York gem, but the prices are reasonable and gives me a small piece of \"home\" down south. 
If you're looking for true authentic wood fired pizza, Zio's is your best bet. I love their grilled arugla salad or daily specials. True italian! The staff is friendly, but a little slow. I recommend this at 4 stars because of their low beer/wine selection and limited seating. Otherwise, bring the kids for a casual sit down or grab a pizza to go and inhale!"}
{"text":"This place is a good Italian restaurant. The last time we went it wasn't to good but last night it was great. The shrimp scampi hit the spot! My wife wants it again tonight. I love this place because it's not to expensive. I'm surprised at the people that complain about how their prices have gone up. Hello, have any of y'all been to Olive Garden the fast food of Italian? This place is a good small place with great food!  If your into chain restaurants than go to Olive Garden but if your into good food go to Zio!"}
{"text":"Good prices, friendly staff.  I really enjoyed my white pizza."}
{"text":"Great little place. There were 3 of us.  We started with the calamari. Very tasty.  Nice sauce drizzle on top. Marinara sauce too.  Hubby had the lasagna. Huge piece and super tasty.  Their marinara sauce is delicious. I had one of the specials.  Shrimp Florentine w risotto cake. Yum.  Good amount of big juicy shrimp. Risotto was delicious- crispy outside hot and moist on the inside. My friend was so excited to see speidees on the menu. She's from endicot NY and felt like she found home. She can't wait to go back!  She had the chicken piccata and loved every bite.  We saw lots of pizzas go out the door so the must be good and a neighborhood favorite!  We did try desserts. Hubby had tiramisu. Different than usual but still tasty. Chocolate cake was dry for me but friend liked it. My only wish would be to see more Italian wines by the glass on the menu."}
{"text":"Shrimp app was pretty good. Not too heavily breaded, which I liked. Goes well with the arugula and sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I went with the Cajun pasta and was very impressed. My suggestion is to go on off days because the seating and staff can't do crowds."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise for din. I have never seen this place. Wasn't a long wait at all and we got there around 7:30/8ish. Sat in a nice small booth where out lovely server greeted us with a smile and joy. Had a great bottle of Chianti. Ordered the toasted ravioli for the appetizer. It was good, but just not my thing. For my entree I ordered from the seasonal menu. Roasted garden vegetable quinoa salad with grilled salmon. Got the balsamic glaze and lemon juice on the side. Wish I took a picture of this because it was delicious!!! One of the best pieces of salmon I have had in a very long time. Was served in a bowl with mixed greens, sweet potatoes, goat cheese, pecans, peppers & the dressings on the side (didn't even need them). The salmon was flaky and just so amazing. I was craving salmon so it was a great choice.
Didn't give 5 stars only cause I'm not a big fan of italian in general."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary based off the other reviews I had read off Yelp and can happily say it was a great decision!   Andrew, our server, was incredibly personable, helpful, and never gave us the chance to hit the bottom of our glasses!   My fiance had the stuffed eggplant & I had the grilled artichoke pizza... both were fantastic!   Pricing was actually lower than I'd have expected for it to be as wonderful as it was.  We'll DEFINITELY be going back!"}
{"text":"If Yelp  had 1/2 stars this would be a one and a half.  I reserve 1 stars for places that I truly dislike.  This restaurant I just kind of felt sorry for.  Nothing that the \"slick\" old family feeling that their menu invokes came through.  Maybe after all this is just a good pizza restaurant.  I had spaghetti with sea food sauce, a small salad, and club soda. No bread was forth coming.  This came to $19.50.  The only thing good about the pasta was that it was cooked  well not over or under but al dente.  The sauce which had a few sprigs of spinach , a few shrimp , a number of unidentified little balls of something that did not look like any sea food that I was familiar with and one, count 'em up folks, one piece of squid.  The marinara  sauce was bland. watery, and boring as hell.  They need to move up one shelf at the Harris Teeter.  I was shown to a table in the back room where the constant chatter of the wait staff centered on mostly last nights date, last weeks party etc. Noisy!.  I was never asked whether my food was satisfactory how I felt about world peace, or any thing for that matter.  This place in my estimation has little idea of the basics of restaurant hospitality.  When I finished my main course I was handed my check. No questions i.e. How was is it? would you care for dessert? How about some coffee? Don't get me wrong. No one was rude. A pleasant woman up by the door thanked me for coming and hoped I would be back.  I will think very seriously about that -- but at this point it doesn't look likely."}
{"text":"I'm not even going to suggest certain foods because I've YET to find anything less than wonderful at Zio! I've lived littereally next door to the restaurant and as a bachelor! dine there frequently!
        The owners and much of the staff are actually Italian and they make their food with love. I've been sick lately and despite not delivering they have made special exceptions for me. (I'm 100 feet away though so don't think you will get that privilege!)
          Also, it's both family friendly and the divided dining rooms leave space for adults to sit at the bar or a cozy booth.
           Bottom line! I give them 5 stars! If you've never been, don't wait any longer!!

{"text":"Hey- Jason b- I'm the server that took over your table when you demanded a different server. I would like to say that it would have been nice if you let me know your pasta was dry cause I would have gotten you something  different- sorry about that. Our pasta is usually really good. It was after 9 which means we had already closed. We all really care about your experience and do our best. On a side note calling my co worker Marc an ogre is completely uncalled for. He's super knowledgeable about the menu. He works his butt off and couldn't be a nicer person. He's also smart and funny. You should be aware that these reviews are often read out loud at work meetings. Keep it about what we can improve- constructive criticism. Not what server is attractive enough to serve you. :("}
{"text":"We ordered the toasted ravioli and it was so good.. I also ordered a warm quinoa kale salad and it had really great flavor. It's cool that they grow their own vegetables. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went to this location yesterday and there seem to be a growing trend in Charlotte.  As I walked in there was a waiter with his bowl of pasta sitting beside him at the front in plain view.  He is eating and waiting on customers.  I know this is a City of Charlotte code violation, Safe Service violation and a sanitation one."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few friends for a birthday, and I was really excited to try it after reading all the good reviews. 
It is a nice little place, feels very \"homey\", and comfortable! 
Menu looked great, as well as the specials that our server let us know about. For my first time here I wanted to stick with something simple so I could get a feel for the place. At our table, 1 ordered the Mahi Mahi special, we got a grilled sausage & pepper pizza, some penne with sausage, and a chicken parm. Everyone really liked their food! The pizza was great, loved the slight char from the grilling. Nice thin crust. Mahi was very good, risotto it was served on was very good as well. The food was all fantastic. 
The reason I am only giving 3 stars is that the service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly, laid back, and \"chill\", saying \"dude\" and other dead surfer terms. His big downfall wasn't his lingo though believe it or not. He chose to not write down anything for a table of 6, and it showed. He came back to the table 2x to confirm who had ordered what. Then he put our pizza in wrong, and had to run to the kitchen and tell them the correct pie. THEN when it came time for the checks, he had everything mixed up, some peoples entrees on other peoples checks. He was very nice and friendly, but didn't seem to have it all together. 
I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, because again, the food was fantastic. Just hoping I get another server next time!"}
{"text":"went at 9:30pm on a Saturday night and they said they were closed even though the sign on door hours were 10:30."}
{"text":"My meal was delicious- the others in my party were satisfied with theirs.  My only gripe about this place was our long wait for our food. However, the waiter took care of this issue and gave us half off."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have gone here for years. Probably best for families. Great food and local feel. My favorite pie in town. I've had just about everything on the menu and all is very good. Favs are cheese pie, speedies app and choc cake."}
{"text":"I've been searching for CLT's best pizza and finally made the visit to Zios.  Unfortunately it was just average.  Not bad, but not sure I would go back again just for the food.

First, when I walked in there was an awful smell... kind of like dirty wet dish rags and reminded me of a dive bar bathroom.  Okay, after 5-10 minutes you get used to it, and we were sat near the door so maybe its not so bad elsewhere in the restaurant.  Either way, its a bad smell and needs to be corrected.

On to the food... I read most of the reviews to figure out what best to order... started with the harvest salad (pretty good - I would recommend), then we got the angel hair pasta with meatballs (not bad, but nothing special) and then we got the grilled pizza (not my fav).  The pizza was supposed to have mozarella cheese, but it was so salty and was either not mozarella or was a very cheap one, like the kind that pizza shops use when they are cutting corners on cost.  I had high hopes, but the pizza let me down.  For now, I'll stick with Pure Pizza until I find one better."}
{"text":"\"Zio! Zio! Zio!\" And the crowd goes wild! 

Walk down the steps and into the warm and cozy nook that is Zio. Now inhale! Mmmmm! The first things you take in are the aromas. Someone is cooking something that you will want to eat!! Just play it cool though, and walk don't run to your table.

The Pizza - Cheese: wonderful sauce with intense tomato flavor layered with cheese. Spicy Chicken Sausage Pizza: large and in charge - smoky, spicy sausage and roasted red peppers - great savory combination.

The Main Courses - Chicken Piccata - simple and delicious - bursting with lemon, capers and butter, served with angel hair pasta. Now close your eyes and imagine if Eggplant Parmesan was an enormous vegetarian Ribeye, the thickest you've ever seen, fileted and stuffed with fresh ricotta and spinach - really an amazing dish. Now cover it with sauce, homemade pasta and mounds of cheese; yeah, it just got better. 

The Cannoli - do what you must - even if it involves loosening your belt or undoing your pants. You must make room. Both the homemade filling and shells will leave you wanting more. Pop! There goes another button...

Zio, you can be my uncle anytime! I'll bring the napkins and you bring the food! Deal?!"}
{"text":"This place has totally gone down hill. It makes me
Sad. Take out is a joke, it takes twice as long as they say, its poorly packaged and you dont get as much as you do in house. They have gone up on their prices too which sucks. $11 for spaghetti and marinara - come on. I asked for extra sauce( because they never have ended enough, )  and they gave me a tiny side cup. Gee thanks. Totally not worth the $"}
{"text":"We went excited to try a new Italian place since we have driven by it quite a bit and have also seen reviews for it. As soon as we walked in we were hit by an uncomfortable heat wave. It was hovering around 60 degrees outside. Uncomfortable but we suck it out. 

We were seated at a booth that was uncomfortably small for two people and entrees on the table at the same time. We proceeded to order two pizzas since we assumed they were small personal pizzas. Once I looked around at other pizzas I realized the pizzas were 14\" and there was no way two of the could fit on the table and it would be way too much for two people. 

After canceling our second pizza after the debacle, we ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the goat cheese dip. The goat cheese dip came out and I was very disappointed. Goat cheese is already creamy and it came out melted looking like a clam chowder. Nothing would stick to the pita points served with it. It had decent flavor but the texture was horrible. The pizza, on the other hand, was really good and the prosciutto was nice and salty. I would definitely like to go back since I think it can be better but I don't know when that will be. I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and had a wonderful time!

The fried ravioli was great and our golden beet salad was delicious.

I recommend subbing in one of their fresh pastas in whatever dish you order, it was amazing!  Pizza was also good.

I ordered a slice of chocolate cake for dessert and my server (Amanda) brought it out with a candle and sang!  

Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Zio, I wanted to love you but your rambling ways turned me away.  The food I must say was fine but the service was just like a soup sandwich.  The cheese pizza was pretty fabulous and the grilled arugula salad I had was equally good.  

No matter the food you have to figure out how to train the wait staff.  We had no less than four people visit our table which isn't the issue.  The issue is that none of them really took ownership of said table.  I went without my second drink due to just plain forgetting to get it via the waiter.  Generally slow service.  Figure that out and you've got a good gig going."}
{"text":"Zio is a tiny nook of a neighborhood place that serves casual Italian pasta, pizzas, and a handful of entrees in a very family friendly atmosphere (though they do have a bar) that is well-patronized by the local Myers Park and Eastover neighborhoods.

The location of Zio can make it a bit hard to find..  as you have to head down a set of shallow stairs to access it, with another restaurant up on top.  Being on an otherwise residential street is also a bit of a challenge, and on busier nights you will likely need to park on the street as well.

Once inside, though, you'll find a comfy, warm atmosphere - plenty of tables and booths on both sides of the place.  Do note that there is an early dinner rush here as parents get off work and look to bring the crew in for dinner.  Waits are common on Friday and Saturday,

The tables themselves come with a large helping of Italian bread, complete with a dipping oil.  Glasses of drinks are quite large and there is a nice selection of beers here, both local and imports.

As to the menu, it's stocked with salads, entrees, and pizzas of both the grilled and the baked variety.  Just don't go overboard with the toppings here- they get pricey pretty quickly and this is not a place that offers combos deals like the major chains do (but this is a good thing).

You'll find a handful of appetizers too, but I recommend you check out their specials on the chalk boards,  as there are always some good finds here.

Everything here is done pretty well, and their pizzas have a nice, thin crust with plenty of chew to keep things most and not brittle.  I even enjoy their salads and there are some good combos here- especially with roasted pear and creamy be cheese.

Service is generally good, though servers can get caught up quite quickly with the rush should you happen to stop in during a busier time.  However, this is not a white tablecloth place and things are a bit more relaxed.  For casual Italian with great pizza, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Tonight I took out their fish special. I'll have to say it was great. Flounder, green beans and orzo mixed with butternut squash and kale. Really, really good. I've had all good experiences with their specials."}
{"text":"There are so many Italian places in Charlotte, it's hard to know where to go, but take it from me, this one is worth checking out! We had a group of 9 and they accommodated us without a problem and kept up with great service the whole time we were there.

As a Jersey girl, I judge my Italian restaurants by the quality of their cheese pizza... and man, it did not disappoint! Thin (but not Napoli thin) crust.. not hard or burnt, just crispy, and the cheese.. oh my goodness the cheese... melting right off the slice. YUM!

I then ordered the Spinach and Beans entree which was mildly healthy compared to other choices haha. It was well flavored and very fresh. Zio has a garden outside that they pick many of their ingredients from, which is very cool. 

We ended our meal by splitting some cannoli's and a lemoncello cake with a raspberry drizzle. Again, very well made.

Definitely will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Took Ted F.'s suggestion and ordered the Sweet Sausage grilled pizza - very tasty. We had the chocolate cake for dessert - out of this world."}
{"text":"Great family-owned Italian spot! I tried the spaghetti with meatballs, chicken parmigiana, side house salad and chocolate cake. I'm quite critical with restaurants, but I have only positive feedback. I will be coming back here in the near future. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Very tasty, reasonably priced, great service, great location and fun, family friendly atmosphere!
The pan-seared scallop special was phenominal, the chicken piccata was a winner and the fried ravioli appetizer was a great choice!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite Italian restaurants! It has a nice family casual feel, very welcoming and comfortable. The food is delicious too! We had a pizza and the spinach and beans entree (soooo good)! The service was on top of it too. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night at Zio and overall I wasn't very impressed.

We started with bread which was nice and crusty but was served with  cold sauce ...heated up would have been much tastier. 

Our server took our order but wasn't very friendly - and apparently forgetful. Five minutes later another server asked us what our entrees were again. I ordered a salad with my meal ,but eventually it became clear she forgot to bring it out. When I asked her about it again, she goes \"oh you wanted it in the beginning? - it's ready now its just sitting back there.\" No, I want my caesar to sit back there sopped in dressing so the romaine becomes wilted. She then brought out my salad and meal together ...but my roommates salad was brought out shortly after. If it is a meatless salad there really isn't an excuse not to bring them out together. 


My salad was good -the dressing was clearly homemade, and the lettuce luckily still crisp. My roommate also liked her salad. My pasta dish (which was a special), tasted just ok. I am picky when it comes to good italian, but I felt that the tomato cream sauce was watery and the dish seemed more like something from a chain like TGI Fridays (covered in un-melted cheese  - veggies cut very small - sparce ingriedients that didn't seem to be high quality). 


The meal was big and the price was fairly inexpensive ($16 for salad and pasta dish). - 1 star for lackluster entree -1 star for poor service."}
{"text":"Zio is a friendly neighborhood place that serves \"Homemade Pasta, Grilled Pizza and Hot Pies (Pizza)\".

The location of Zio can make it a bit hard to find..  Just head down Middleton Drive and park in the lot on the right, then down the stairs and you're there.  That wasn't bad, was it?

Once inside, you'll find a warm atmosphere - though if it's cold outside, you won't want to sit too close to the door.  Apparently the other side can get warmer (according to TR) because it's close to the kitchen, but families generally sit there (you may want to keep this in mind if you have a rowdy bunch - that's up to you).

The tables themselves come with a nice helping of bread, complete with butter and marinara.  The bad thing is that the marinara is cold.  Not room-temperature cold, but out-of-the-fridge cold.  It would be nicer if the marinara was at least lukewarm, if not actually heated.  Still, it's not bad.

As to the menu, it's a bit sparse, but that's not a bad thing because of the selection.

You'll find a handful of appetizers, such as salmon cakes (two, which are more ball-shaped than cake-like), beef spiedies eggplant and mozzarella rounds.  There are salads and daily soups - generally at least one is vegetarian-friendly.

The pasta is homemade or \"imported\" (not sure what the latter means exactly), and the sauce on the pasta is very light and quite tasty.  It also differs from the sauce on the pizza, which can be unusual - some places serve up the same stuff on both.

Speaking of the pizzas, there are two varieties here - grilled pizza and thin crust.  For the life of me, I couldn't tell the difference.  Both are a thin crust, and both are fairly crispy.  The grilled is cut into squares while the \"standard\" is cut in a more traditional wedge shape.  But both taste about the same (toppings excepted).

I'm a fan of grilled pizza, and they advertise as having the only grilled pizza in Charlotte, which I don't think is true (Revolution does as well, I believe).  But the pizzas are pretty good either way.

We had four of them altogether - cheese, pepperoni, sausage and white.  All were tasty.  I think the white was my favorite (naturally, it was the one I ordered).  The grilled didn't do as well out of the fridge the next morning, but if you don't have leftovers, that may not matter.

Service was excellent, even though we had a tendency to order one at a time (oh, I'd like this!), and items came out in a generally ordered fashion.  Glasses were filled whenever they dipped low, drinks kept coming.  All-in-all a nice experience.  Not great, but definitely solid and worthwhile.

Perhaps a bit on the pricey side for pizza and pasta, but not bad at all.  Check out the UYE review for details on the event itself."}
{"text":"Came here for New Years with a reservation. We were sat immediately. We waited a long time for our food but it was understandable. We never complained but turns out they lost our ticket and comped our food to half off. I couldn't believe they offered that especially with us not even complaining! The lasagna was huge and very cheesy. My only complaint is that I wish it had a little bit more sauce. My fiancé thought it was just right. Never had their pizza but tables around us got it and it looked good!"}
{"text":"Zio has been on my list for a long time (that's why I made it a point to put it on my #Yelps10FirstCLT list) and it definitely did not disappoint. Solid food and super affordable. 

We had a group of nine for dinner on a Monday night. They don't really take reservations, but if you have a large group go ahead and call ahead to give them the heads up you're coming. 

Yelper Tonya P has told me for years, make sure to get a plain cheese pizza as an appetizer when you go to Zio. Pretty good rule of thumb in Charlotte: listen to Tonya when it comes to food. We got two for the table and man, they were delicious. I would've never thought to order a plain cheese pizza here, let alone getting one as an app to share. Tonya for president. For my entree, I ordered the seafood pasta from the specials board. It was delicious and had a good amount of quality seafood in it. We also ordered cannolis, tiramisu, and lemoncello cake. The lemoncello cake was my favorite. I needed more than a couple bites, so I also got one to go. 

On Mondays and Tuesdays, they do half price bottles of wine. Make sure to take note of the ones that qualify, look for the selections with the asterisk. Or, just clarify with your server ahead of time because not only bottles are on special. 

Good food, great company and what made the evening even better- our server. Our ticket said her name was Deborah (so I hope I'm giving credit to the proper person) and she was just amazing. She took great care of us and was just fabulous to be around all evening. 

Zio, I'm sorry it took me this long to come visit. I'll definitely be back. Get a cheese pizza ready for me!"}
{"text":"Zio is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. It took me forever to find a good Italian place down here, and once I found Zio, it became my go-to spot. Have been going for years now and have never had a bad experience. The grilled pizza is thin and crispy, the arugula salad is fresh and delicious, and I don't know what they do with the frosting on their chocolate cake, but it's amazing. I rarely stray from these things on the menu but when I do, I'm never disappointed. The prices are also extremely reasonable. The atmosphere is casual and it allows the wait staff's personalities to complement their attentive service. I'll stop ranting now about how much I like Zio, but please do yourself a favor and try it out."}
{"text":"Zio is a quaint mom and pop Italian gem.  Easy atmosphere, solid entrees and pizzA, great for a family, date or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome! Been here a few times. Sat at the bar for drinks and food. Wine list is good as well as the service. Grilled pizza is delicious and one of the best chicken parm I have ever had. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting! The food was delicious. I ordered the angel hair and meatballs and if was wonderful. The bread and garden salad was so fresh and everything was amazing! The atmosphere is casual but really nice inside. I can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Good place for the family. Nice neighborhood feel. Food is good and reasonable too. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Well, the secret is out. The jig is up. 

Last night, we went to Zio and had a near 45 minute wait. While that isnt crazy, this used to be a place where you were almost assured a short wait for very good food. I am definitely happy for their success but miss when it felt like only a few people knew about it! 

As far as the food, we both had pizza. The pizza, of course, was excellent. It's the best pizza in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Everyone deserves another chance, right? Well despite my troubles last visit here, I have always liked their food.  I haven't been since my last review so decided to come back for a try.

I brought my mom & my nephew and we arrived about 5:30.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Our waiter's name was Tim and he was exceptionally friendly and prompt. 

I ordered the stuffed eggplant parm and a beet/fries goat cheese salad. The meal was delicious. The salad was decent although the dressing was a little on the sour side. I tasted one of my mom's meatballs and it was very good.

I was happy with this experience and glad to try this restaurant again.  I hope in the future I can make many trips back here."}
{"text":"Got their summer risotto and house salad, which was delicious. Spectacular service to go along with as well."}
{"text":"I love our CLT Yelp crew and we could probably hit the crappiest 'raunt in town and still have a rad time. It was also snowing, or trying to. Still had the regs show up ready to nosh.

Zio was good, accommidating, comfy. Our annoying questions and distracted ordering were handled with aplomb. The bruschetta puree was, I'm assuming, intentionally chilled, and I dug. 

Thanks, TR, for getting us here - tucked away where it is, I'd probably have never made it here on my own. Parking looks like it could get rough but there's another lot next to the one directly in front of Zio, so I imagine you could stick your vehicle there in a pinch."}
{"text":"Props to the person who suggested the toasted ravioli. They were nice and plump, filling & very tasty. The nice surprise of the night was The Rigatoni Maria which had this light cream sauce that was outstanding. It wasn't so rich either, just the right amount to deliver solid flavor. Next time I might need to try the pizza that everyone raves about. All in all a nice little Italian spot in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Zio is a neighborhood favorite for us. I like to try something different each time I go (typically seafood/chicken + pasta) -- like shrimp & spinach with wine sauce. I recently tried the glutton free pasta and it was really good. I like how they have a fresh pasta selection as well. I have found that the vast majority of dishes do not disappoint. Zio's gets extra points for their incredible bread. 

Zio's is a nice little neighborhood Italian restaurant with an old school vibe - especially the cool oversized bar area. The restaurant is sectioned off into a bar area & booth seating on the left (I like to think of it as the adult area) and a louder family friendly area on the right. I count Zio Casual Italian among the best Italian Restaurants in Charlotte for a consistently good, affordable meal. And, the bread."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised by this place. First time I went we ordered the grilled pizza with sausage and it was absolutely delicious. We couldn't stop talking about it. Their house salad was delicious too. I had a craving for meatballs tonight and decided to order a salad and a side of meatballs. These are the best meatballs I've ever had in my life after my grandmothers. SO good, a MUST have."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time was a \"5\".  The last time was a \"3\".  So for now I'm giving it a 4.  

We ordered two dishes.  One pizza which was excellent and one pasta dish which was horrible.  If you get some crappy dry pasta at Harris Teeter, dump some store bought tomato sauce on it, you then would have the dish that we were served.  It sucked.  

The service was horrific.  Our initial server appeared to have Ogre DNA.  I say that from both an aesthetic standpoint and from an intellectual point of view.  We waited and waited.  Then he asked \"Are you ready to order?\".  We enthusiastically said \"Yes!\" as we had been waiting for a while.  He then walked away and after another 10 minutes passed I asked for a different server who was very good.  It's not as though the place was busy with it being after 9PM at this point.  

It's too bad.  I really liked this place a lot initially.  But now I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Me likey!!  Let's be honest...I think the real reason I liked this place is because it felt like I was walking into my grandma's kitchen.  She is old school italian and has some of the same creepy black and white photos of random Italian families hanging on her walls...And her house has the aroma of garlic 24-7.  :)

No, seriously...I was impressed with Zio.  I don't eat Italian out very often because I prefer homemade sauce and pasta.  I am an Italian food snob because I come from an italian family...sorry, just being honest.  But, Zio was pretty decent.  

I liked the atmosphere...as I described earlier..I expected grandma to walk out of the kitchen at any moment.  It is a low key, casual environment...which is great.

I went with the basic angel hair and meat sauce with meatballs dish.  It was very good.  The sauce was a little tangy and maybe slightly too salty for my taste but it was good and homemade so I can't complain.  The meatball was very good as well.  It was also homemade and had a lot of flavor.  My dining partners tried the Penne Vodka and the Salmon Piccata and they were very impressed.  The vodka sauce was a little runny but it still had great flavor and a ton of fresh cut garlic so that was awesome. 

The bread they serve with your meal was very good but I will say the herb infused olive oil was a bit bland.  We had to add salt and pepper so it didn't just taste like vegetable oil.  I am questioning if they ran out of olive oil and just served us something else.  Not sure...

I hear the pizza is the way to go with Zio and I will definitely be back so that will be the next thing I try.  But, overall, I think it is a good, down-home, authenticish Italian restaurant here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Zio has been on my Bookmarks for a while now, and all I can say is I hate that I didn't get there earlier. We arrived for an early dinner, around 6:30, and got one of the last tables on the outside patio. Upon being seated we were greeted by our waiter, who was very friendly, and offered water and fresh bread, made at Nova's bakery. As we checked out the menu we observed a women working in their outside garden, where they grow herbs and vegetables, now that is fresh!

We started with the arugula salad, which was light and extremely fresh with arugula, asparagus and candied almonds. And, after seeing the other Yelp photos we decided to check out the classic cheese pie and a side of meatballs. The pizza, or pie as they call it, was amazing! The dough was cooked to perfection, with a light and fluffy crust, topped with just the right amount of cheese and herbs. As for the meatballs, OMG, they reminded me of my Italian grandmother's, served it a great marinara sauce. 
The service was great, and although the restaurant is definitely old school it is a hidden gem with amazing Italian traditions. Cannot wait to get back and check out some of the entrees!"}
{"text":"First time, both my wife and I enjoyed our meals. I had a caesar salad, best ever. Staff was very friendly, place was very busy. Our pasta was homemade and we enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in the south, hands down. Jimmy did a wonderful job of recreating a copy of his famous New York State restaurant.
The only thing missing is bread from Battaglini Bakery."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant that was a total find! I ended up coming here for a birthday dinner and it was really good! I've been dying to go back since."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Zio.  It's a bit tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Providence road, but once you find you way in, there's a pretty good chance you will find something delicious.

I love of comforting smell of Italian goodness and the warm feeling you get when you enter.  The space is interesting with a low ceiling and configuration since the building is older, but still makes for a cool mom and pop spot(in my opinion).

Don't have the history of this place, but you can tell it was passed down from a generation and dedicated to family loved ones.

This place always is busy when I go, which is a good sign.  The waitstaff is super friendly and always on the move due to the place being busy, but you never leave hungry.

Place is very family friendly.  Definitely fun to see kids enjoy pizza and pasta as much as I do."}
{"text":"Sometimes the best places really are the ones you'd never expect it from.

So the dinner group is trying another \"new to us\" restaurant at Zio.  The restaurant is below Primo in Myers Park.  It's not a fancy place and described as casual Italian. 

The decor is simple with paneled walls and a little brick.  There's a bar to the left side of the restaurant, booths along the walls of the restaurant and tables in the open spaces.  There are few tables outside on the patio.

The menu is simple with pizzas, salads, pasta selections  and a few Italian entrees.  I went with one of my favorite Italian dishes, Chicken Piccata and a side house salad.  

The salad was beautiful.  Shaved parmesan cheese on top of mixed greens and a few chunks of tomato with a homemade Italian dressing.  Absolutely delicious also.

The Chicken Piccata was a breast of chicken on top of angel hair pasta in a very light lemon, caper sauce.  There were a few veggies for a garnish on the side.  This has to be the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had.  The chicken was tender and was plain.,.not covered in flour and fried like many places do.  And the sauce was so light.  They even gave you a lemon wedge if you were craving more flavor.  My mouth was singing!  

For dessert, someone said we needed to try the chocolate cake.  And they were right.  This cake was wonderful.  A light frosting covered a dense and moist chocolate cake.  But I also heard the tiramisu was really good also.

Service wise, our server was fantastic.  Every order was spot on and she explained specials and had no issues with splitting the bill for 9 people.  

Definitely need to come back here.  This is by far, the best casual Italian place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I ordered the pear and Gorgonzola pizza, and my wife ordered the Uncle Duff pie with jalapenos, mushrooms and onions.  My pizza was a little greasy but delicious overall. My wife thought her pizza was good, was perfect for thin crust lovers and had a good proportion of toppings. The prices are good for what you get. Wine list is reasonable but mainly Italian. The service could have been better. Our waitress disappeared for awhile and failed to check on us. Parking and seating is a bit cramped. But overall it's a good neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place in Charlotte. Great food and not very expensive. My favorite is the spaghetti with meatballs. Haven't tried their pizza yet, but hear it's really good as well."}
