{"text":"Un café à chat c'est vraiment sympa ! Le fait que ça soit vegan m'a un peu choqué au début mais en fait le cappuccino au lait d'amande était bon. Certes j'en boirai pas tous les jours mais une fois de temps en temps pourquoi pas ! C'est super cool de pouvoir caresser tous ces chats. Apparement on peut les adopter aussi."}
{"text":"This was my very first cat cafe experience and was I pleasantly surprised how much I love this place that we've been back here every morning.  The place is clean, the staff and cats are all very friendly and welcoming, and the best part is they have a little kitten!!!     They have a large amount of board games, very comfortable seating, front and back patio.  The decor in this place is beautiful. Food wise they serve vegan food which is a pleasant change after a weekend indulgence of massive poutine. Many options for drinks: anything from filtered coffee, espressos, matcha lattes, to espresso milkshakes!  If you are visiting Montreal, you definitely will be walking down St Denis-- you must stop by this place."}
{"text":"This cat cafe was amazing! We actually visited another cat cafe the same day (Café Chat l'heureux) and Cafe Venosa was much much better. As we came in, we fell in love with the decor and the atmosphere of the place. It's very quiet (though the music was great) and really does have a coffee shop feel. The staff were super lovely. We ordered a dirty chai and tomato soup, not realizing it was vegan. It was some of the best coffee and soup I've ever had.  The cats were very sweet and although they weren't necessarily all over you, that was nice. They were very playful, chasing each other and running around. Super cute. Plus, all the cats (except one resident cat), are \"fosters\" from the SPCA. This shop isn't just buying cats; they're actually helping lots of cats get adopted and find new homes. We thought that was sweet.  Overall, I highly recommend this cafe. It's lovely and the cats make it even better. :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this vegan cat cafe rather serendipitously. The baristas speak both French and English, and are warm and attentive.    We ordered a drip coffee, chai latte, chocolate chip cookie, and quiche--all of which were unbelievably delicious and extremely affordable. There's free WiFi, and comfortable seating throughout. You can come alone or with a group to the cafe.  Prices are extremely affordable and great quality.   The cats are, naturally, adorable and friendly.  What's more about this cat cafe (beyond its vegan menu) is that the cats are all available to be adopted. I wanted to take one home to Toronto!   Even if you're not vegan and looking for a great cafe, I highly recommend this place. The food is delicious, the service is great, and the cats are fantastic."}
{"text":"Jan.3rd. my daughter and I joined a friend for another good  lunch at café Venosa Wonderful ! The tomato soup was SO good -  fresh..  delicious Cesar salads were very fresh with a difference...ground cashews instead of parmesan Lovely cats.....the  are cute ! ......cupcakes, pecan tart, brownie....mmm mm...all really enjoyed Nice relaxed atmosphere.....my daughter said ' Cosy ' Thanks again....we' ll drive over from NDG / West end of Mtl again another day.... definitely worth the trip recommending café Venosa  to everyone ! ( Katherine)"}
{"text":"This place is 1000% vegan and SO DELICIOUS! All the sandwiches are worth trying & don't miss the potato salad. They have great selections of coffee drinks & you must try the toasted marshmallow Italian soda!   So fun to be surrounded by the cute kitties, which are all up for adoption!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this cafe I wish they opened one up in Toronto! I enjoyed my experience here so much I came here two days in a row during my weekend visit.   The staff were so friendly and helpful. The cats were so friendly as well. there's this one kitten that stole my heart Cosmo. The ambient is hip cool modern and comfortable. The cafe is clean and I smelled no trace of kitty litter or stench even though there were at least 6 cats which were all so well behaved. You can adopt them too - I'm a huge supporter of animal adoption. They have vegan food and their prices are extremely reasonable. Coffees range from$2-$4.75 desserts $2.25-4.75, sandwiches soups salads from $3.75-$8 which is cheaper than other food along St.Denis. I recommend this cafe and would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Best vegan food in Montreal.  Caesar salad that actually tastes like it's meant to, and wraps with just the right amount of sauce.  Prices are very reasonable and coffee drinks are great.  They have a back terrace that's completely closed off so you can be in the outside air with the cats which is great!"}
{"text":"This has officially become my favorite place to go. First of all: cats. But really, the food is fantastic and the service is just wonderful. My boyfriend and I had the Trigan pizza with Gusta cheeze and it was delicious! It's fresh, tasty and affordable. Definitely recommend getting the pizza for 2 unless you have a big appetite. Oh and FINALLY a place with vegan doughnuts (on weekends)! I can't wait to go back and absolutely recommend it for vegans and omnivores alike :)"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! Have an excellent soy hot chocolate or vegan cupcakes surrounded by lovely (and open for adoption) cats. Staff is fantastic as well An experience!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. My earl grey tea infused with caramel was delightful. Ditto my vegan parfait. I have no idea how one makes vegan yogurt- but I am happy to report it tastes just as good if not better than \"the real thing.\" My parfait was loaded with freshly cut fruit. Jason L was very happy with his homemade scone.  The cats were numerous, and very friendly. I grew particularly fond, of a big tuxedo-ed guy, who stole my straw right from my glass and proceeded to play with it the rest of our visit. A number of the other cats came right up to our table and demanded pets and snuggles. There was a wide range of both kittens and older cats. Most of the cats are adoptable- which I think is awesome! It's a brilliant way to socialize otherwise skittish cats.   There appears to be a lot of crevices,beds, and hiding places for the cats- a good way to keep them from becoming overstimulated by their admirers.   The cafe itself was clean and spacious. Unlike some cat cafes - which can feel musty- Cafe Verona was very modern and bright. It did not suffer from cat odor.   To summarize; Cafe Venosa is a great place to relax and to  get away from the hustle and bustle of city life."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is absolutely amazing I love their service the atmosphere and their prices and by the way the company of the cats I would highly recommend it to anybody who's looking for a cozy place to unwind and that are vegetarian and vegan. But also this is not just a regular coffee shop it's also an adoption center for cats so when you talk about having a business with humanity behind it this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Sweet vegan cat cafe right in a great location. Kombucha, mellow kitties, and dairy free coffee drinks. Free wifi. Limited menu, but the chocolate tart was delish!"}
{"text":"Had their chai latte and pizza, they were both so yummy  The atmosphere of the café was very cozy and warm, and the cats were also adorable and friendly! Will definitely go again or recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This is an adorable cat cafe! I enjoyed spending some time here to take advantage of free wi-fi and kitty cuddles while my husband and I were here to visit Montreal for a long weekend. I had a very tasty cafe au lait with almond milk.  My husband liked his iced tea.  The kitties were all super cute, though they (understandably) seemed a bit overstimulated!  My only comment is that service can be a bit slow--took about 30 minutes for our drinks to come out and the staff was very slow to clear other tables of empty plates--stressful since the cats aren't supposed to eat the food and they were trying to eat from these plates."}
{"text":"J'adore les cafés chats et celui-ci est le 3e arrivé à Montréal Les chats sont tous différents, sympas et calins; il y a la possibilité de les adopter! Il suffit de demander à une serveuse et elle vous donnera l'adresse courriel à laquelle écrire pour l'adoption La bouffe et les cafés sont bons (attention, c'est vegan donc lait de soya ou d'amande uniquement) Il y a quelques divans et fauteuils pour + de confort A tester!"}
{"text":"Café agréable pour se détendre. Atmosphère cosy et les chats sont mignons.  Cependant les prix ont presque doublé en 1 an, et la serveuse n'était pas très aimable."}
{"text":"As a vegan cafe, it's a five star. As a cat cafe, it's a two star.  The cafe is lovely and the menu is varied and appetizing. But there was a lack of cats when I visited. It was sad, they were all hiding.  The waiter we had was very boorish. He didn't seem to care at all that I was here with my boyfriend. They could have been a 3 star even with the lack of cats but the waiter really ruined the experience.   While I was there this group of High schoolers were making so much noise in the cafe, it was obnoxious.   I'll probably give this place another chance, but just because I think they had a bad business day when I went."}
{"text":"My favorite cat cafe in Montreal! The cats at Venosa just have such a great personality. I could spend all day watching them interact."}
{"text":"As a cat cafe, there was only 4 cats for such a big place and either the cats were hiding or sleeping...so I'm not sure if they are successful as a cat cafe...  The interior is really cute though, I love the cat drawings on the big board. Apparently people can adopt the cats there, which is really nice.  I took the chat botte, an home made ice tea, and it tasted too minty imo"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place! Cats n' coffee--total heaven!  The italian drinks were delicious too. The menu was excellent and the cats! The cats rock! The women who work there are fantastic. Polite, friendly, and helpful. The girl with glasses and a bunch of tattoos from LA was amazing--so friendly and informative and definitely loved cats. We wish we had a place like Cafe Venosa where we are but sadly, we don't. The place that tries to advertise itself like CV is really a shelter that serves coffee/bad snacks but they charge you $8.00 just to get in!   We miss you Montréal and especially Cafe Venosa."}
{"text":"What a lovely cat café! My 4 year-old and I had such a wonderful visit here last week. My daughter just asked me this morning when we can return for another cupcake, cocoa and most of all, to play with the cats. And unlike some of the other cat cafés in Montreal, supervised children are welcome at Café Venosa. The owner is a doll. I am not sure how she vets her cats, but all of the cats are so friendly and out-going. We could have stayed all day. We will certainly be back very soon."}
{"text":"OK. I did NOT know this type of cafe existed in North America. My friend and I were looking for a place to get work done in Montreal when we stumbled across this cafe. With a giant cat symbol on the window, I thought it was only cat themed. But then I saw a live cat resting by the window, and that was the end of my search for a cafe. Walking inside, it was perfect. The large tables for work, free Wifi, cute ambience, availability of food and snacks, and 4-5 cats, some kittens. Smitten with kittens. They have some little toys and stairs for these little critters as well as feeding time, where they let the guests give the cats some snacks.   I have to say that I probably could have gotten more work done, but who cares when there are kittens around. They are really friendly, and where my cat would probably claw you to death for a belly rub, the ones here are decidedly docile.   As for the food, it's a vegan place, meaning you get a choice of soy or almond milk to go with your coffee. The coffee itself was OK. The flat white was excellent. The tempeh wrap was decent (I originally wanted the quiche, but they were out). The parfait and caprese sandwich were also great.  It's a great and unique experience. 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Purr-fest little spot for a quick and chill bite !  Kids are in paradise here !  Surprisingly, the sandwich and wrap are extremely filling !  You might wanna share one with a friend or bring the other half with you home for later !   Super original with all the cats around !  Great concept !!"}
{"text":"I really like the premise of this place: let a bunch of cute (rescued) cats hang out, roaming freely amongst the patrons, enough to give someone a chance to fall in love with one of them and adopt. Plus, the cats are entertaining, with their shenanigans.  This is a vegan café and you'll understand why once you go there - other than promoting the ethics of veganism, honestly, if you had meat on your plate, you'd have a cat swarm in no time. We had a friendly little fellow hop up and make nicey-nice so that we'd let him/her lick the 'butter' (margarine, I assume) off our knives.   This place has great coffee, and really awesome treats like cupcakes and donuts, plus a nice (but quite limited) lunch menu. I personally think they'd do really well to actually bring in some breakfast items for the menu, because the brunch crowd is hungry, dear Venosa. Still, the lack of breakfast or brunch items on the menu means you don't have hordes of people on a Saturday or Sunday morning, so it's calm and quiet and ... cats. Even a bit wider variety on the lunch menu would be appreciated.   Friendly and fun staff, cozy seating (the cats like it) and great music. I left with the warm fuzzies... eh, maybe a little too fuzzy... er, furry. Don't worry, though - they have a whole basket of lint rollers to clean yourself off with before you leave."}
{"text":"As far as 'cat cafes' the best interior.  Staff was friendly.  I know I'm a 'douche' for liking cream, etc w coffee.  The coffee was worst part for me; i don't like soya/almond.  Be nice to have more variety for customers.  Less cats than other cat cafes.  Loved the cat staircase and chalk wall in bathroom.  One time visit."}
{"text":"There were more than enough cats so I don't get why people were complaining about that! I think there were just enough and the cats were super social and fun to watch. Every cat that was out had no problem jumping on the tables and saying hi. I loved how social the cats were! The food was OK just had a gluten free brownie and hot chocolate so I can't say much about it.  Why not 5 stars??? Because the ambiance was definitely a little off.. there were dirty patches of water all over the floor because people were walking around in their boots! I don't get it? The cats aren't wearing boots so why should we? I mentioned it to the woman at the register and she said she gets that comment a lot! Soo.....????   Pros: Seems to be a local favorite, cats are very social Cons: Dirty floors  It's a vegan cafe if that matters to you (I'm not vegan but I don't eat much animal products)"}
{"text":"Cafe Venosa is a vegan, cat cafe located off of Denis.  I was lured in by their cute 'cat' sign and curious to see what this cafe was all about.  I love their mission - being environmentally-conscious while focusing on reducing the animal overpopulation in shelters by adopting and having adoptable cats available to the public.  The menu offers sandwiches, wraps, and pastries, all vegan-friendly.  The cafe itself is a bit dark and musty, but it was still jam-packed when we were there. Scratch posts are laid out sporadically with little hammocks in which cats were napping away.  When the hubs and I walked in, there was a cute black and white cat, sitting by the sink, just staring at the patrons waiting in line. HA!  On little tables, there are even lint rollers, just in case you were getting all touch-happy and have to clean yourself afterwards.  Even though we were both allergic to cats, it was interesting to check this place out :P  +vegan cafe +adoptable cats available +lint rollers available"}
{"text":"Aujourd'hui il fait gris et il pleut. Quoi de mieux pour se réchauffer et se remonter le moral que d'aller boire un thé/café/chocolat chaud au Café Venosa ! Le café est joli et chaleureux. On est accueillis par plusieurs chats super cute et par une équipe très sympa. Rien qu'en arrivant on sait qu'on passer un moment calme et détendu ici. C'est végétarien ici, et c'est très bon ! J'ai gouté la brioche aux amandes, vraiment top ! Possibilité de caresser les chats, de jouer à des jeux de société. Super spot aussi pour venir passer l'après-midi à bosser avec son ordi ou pour lire un bon bouqin, c'est calme et agréable."}
{"text":"Alors, j'explique ces 3 étoiles par le simple fait que j'en ai essayé un autre avant et que je l'ai préféré à celui-ci pour diverses raisons.  La première, je trouve le Café Venosa moins cosy, moins détente. On se croirait dans un salon de thé ordinaire, avec quelques chats qui passent de temps en temps. Au-delà de ca, mon cupcake était très bon et le principe est excellent, des chats et de la nourriture Vegane. Mais je trouve qu'ils auraient pu pousser un peu le truc en rendant l'endroit un peu plus cosy.  Ca ne veut pas dire que je n'y retournerais pas volontiers pour un goûter entre ami(e)s, au contraire, j'apprécierai de pouvoir retenter l'expérience, mais je pense que je privilégierais l'autre établissement."}
{"text":"I visited this place because I wanted a cafe to hang out at that had cats. A few things about my experience will prevent me from ever returning. The service was mediocre, not sure if the waitress was having a bad day. The food is quite expensive. I ordered a tea, pizza and soup combo and it came to over $21. The \"pizza\" is just tomato sauce and vegan cheese over a piece of tortilla, not quite what I was looking forward to.   I did not give a tip when I paid at the counter, and when the same waitress who gave mediocre service noticed this, she said to me \"The $21 does not include a tip\". This is the first time in North America where an employee ever spoke to me about leaving a tip. I found it quite surprising for her to mention it.   Tldr; came expecting a cool place to hang out with cats, left with a memory of expensive food, poor and rude service."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend because i've always wanted to go to a cat cafe. There were four cats when I was here, but they were all sleeping. Still super cute though! This cafe is all vegan which is awesome. I ordered a flat white, which I've been craving ever since becoming vegan. The flat white is very yummy. This is a good place to chill with a friend and pet some cats :)"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed. We saw great ratings and apart from the cats and the place itself, we dont understand why. First, service was really really slow, it took 40min to get coffee and another 30 for the food. (however the latte with soy milk was very good.) the pizzas were disgusting, undercooked with mushy tortilla as dough and horrible toppings like: terribly overripe avocado, cheap caned olives, and rubbery dried tomatoes. All this for the same price you could get a decent pizza for (17$). It is really not because it was vegan that we did not like it (most people could have made a better vegan pizza). Soup and caesar salad were ok (even if we got those after the pizza...)  It is a place you should go to get coffee and play with cats but not for a meal."}
{"text":"I mean...I really really wanted to fall in love with this place. I was more than a little disappointed, though. The service was pretty bad. We waited for twenty minutes before a guy walked up and asked if we'd ordered yet, we said no, and he walked away. Then another five minutes went by. Finally a woman came and took our order. Another ten minutes, she brought out our drinks and asked if that's all we had...it wasn't. She clearly hadn't punched our food in. Another ten minutes and she plunks down our wraps without even an apology...  The food was meh. Another cat cafe in town does it better tbh, but they aren't 100% vegan. The latte, however, was great.   Why I gave three stars: I can't slam their goals even if they need more polish/need to train their staff to give more craps."}
{"text":"Great coffee and treats. Also, cats. If you are into all of the above, you will enjoy your time here,. Perhaps, you will never leave. Perhaps, you will leave with a new feline friend. Perhaps a few. The caffeination of the beverages nicely balances the natural laziness typical of cats. Highly recommended for caffeine addicts and cat ladies in training."}
{"text":"J'ai toujours été enchanté lors de mes visites au Café Venosa. Il y a toujours de la place et, contrairement au Café Chat L'Heureux, l'endroit n'est pas bondé de touristes ou d'enfants. Aussi, j'aime beaucoup le concept du café: les chats (adultes!) que vous croisez sont disponibles à l'adoption. C'est plus rare que des chats adultes soient adoptés et le Café Venosa leur donne davantage de visibilité et de chances de trouver un foyer. Aussi, il y a une assez grande sélection de boissons et la nourriture (entièrement vegan) est bonne. Je craque aussi souvent pour les desserts. Le café réalise également plusieurs événements intéressants et éducatifs. Définitivement un apport positif au quartier et, en général, à la communauté."}
{"text":"Super café vegan avec en bonus des chats ! J'avoue que j'étais intriguée et un peu réticente par le concept de café/chats m'interrogeant sur le côté 'hygiène' de ce genre d'endroit, craignant une odeur de litière et des poils de chat partout...Mais pas du tout. L'endroit est d'une propreté inattaquable et les seules odeurs qui y flottent sont celles du thé, café et des délicieuses pâtisseries que l'on y cuisine.  L'ambiance est aussi très chaleureuse, décontractée et confortable. Il y a des tables de différentes tailles en bois ainsi que des petits fauteuils, des banquettes et chaises évidemment. Et la décoration est très vivante avec du bleu turquoise sur les murs, des fauteuils rouge, des photos des chats qui ont été adoptés avec leur nouvelle famille, un mu-tableau avec des dessins de chats,... Enfin, le meilleur pour la fin, que dire des pâtisseries à part : vraiment, super, méga bon ?! Le brownie chocolat-caramel et noix de pécan est à se damner. J'ai également gouter un scone pomme-pécans succulent, la tarte aux noix de pécans était également très bonne (mais j'apprécie peu la cannelle or il y en avait trop à mon gout) et mon coup de coeur : le beignet au citron. Habituellement, je n'aime absolument pas les beignet que je trouve trop gras, trop mou, sans saveur,...mais là, j'ai adoré ! Ce beignet était vraiment très bon, et s'il était gras, ce n'était pas à en être écoeuré. C'est aussi un endroit parfait pour travailler puisqu'il y a de la place et que la connexion internet fonctionne bien.  Le personnel est agréable et souriant, c'est un plaisir d'y rester.  J'ai donc adoré cet endroit où je retournerai sans faute que ce soit pour l'accueil, l'ambiance et pour satisfaire ma gourmandise, surtout que tout est proposé à un prix plus que raisonnable."}
{"text":"Nice little cat cafe on St-Denis with a cool ambiance and comfy sofa. The hot drinks are bit too sugary for my taste, but that could be to the reason they use almond or soy milk which tends to be sweet. It's a nice place to study or do some work, if you don't get too distracted by cute cuddly cats. Yep, I'll come back there again."}
{"text":"They are doing a good thing with helping abandonned cats.  But sadly, the food is not up with their good deeds.   This is fatty vegan food with a taste of vinegar in everything.  I couldn't finish my wrap which I waited 45 minutes for...   Service was also pretty bad...  Great smile but not really experienced in customer service.   Go to Panthere Verte or Aux Vives for original vegan food."}
{"text":"It was one sunny afternoon when my family and I were walking along St. Denis and decided to give this cafe a try. I was looking for a decent cup of coffee to enjoy. We went in and realize that it is a cat cafe: wonderful! We absolutely adore cats. However, things started to turn for the worse: because of our parking meter we could not stay long, so I only ordered a cup of Americano to go. The server let me wait beside the counter and told me they were extremely busy when I reminded him to-go order several times. After 20 minute he checked and evidently it was  forgotten.  And even the long awaited coffee was horrible. It is masked by their almond milk and did not taste anything remotely close to coffee. This cafe was nothing but a huge disappointed."}
{"text":"Cats. Coffee. Cute everything. Hell yeah. So this was my first visit to a cat café in general, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. The whole establishment is vegan which frankly makes a lot of sense to me given the fact that we're all animal lovers here (why do the other cat cafés not have more vegan stuff??). We just grabbed (inexpensive) iced coffees but I'll definitely be back to try other stuff.  In terms of space and atmosphere, it was perfect- there's a cozy inclosed patio space with twinkle lights where the cats seem particularly happy. The inside of the café is adorable with lots of saturated-colour item furniture; great artwork; lots of cat paraphernalia; and soft, ephemeral tunes playing.  The only down side was maybe that there were only four cats in the whole establishment and they're clearly very used to a lot of affection from patrons. Needless to say, for the most part the kitties were not interested in hanging out with us. I reckon this is probably a regular thing for cat cafés. They were still fun to look at though! Oh, and all of the cats are available for adoption!"}
{"text":"Best Chai Latte ever :) super comfortable and chill place! Food is pretty good and vegan friendly!"}
