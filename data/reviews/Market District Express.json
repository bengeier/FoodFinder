{"text":"Food is good, prices are what you'd expect at a chain restaurant but it's different and the service is friendly. Worth popping in for a bite"}
{"text":"Braised short rib was better than Bistro 19's short rib.  If it is on the menu, don't think twice."}
{"text":"I go here when I need a break from working solely from home. During lunch time it can get pretty busy but it calms down fast. I have had the turkey club which was really good and the Caesar salad, but just beware they do serve anchovies on it. Their fries are really good and their soups are pretty good as well. Overall it's a nice place to get fast fresh food and a nice ambiance to have lunch in."}
{"text":"This new market district express concept store is absurdly close to us, which means we are there all the time.   It is very convenient and that's our main reason for going. 

This sits along side a large GetGo and usually has enough parking for the sometimes throngs of people visiting there.

You've got everything from a small bakery there, to a deli counter, to a Starbucks, to a mini restaurant, to a small grocery store.   It really is one stop shopping.  Don't forget the pharmacy too. 

I'd say that 90% of my experiences have been positive WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RESTAURANT portion. 
The restaurant consistently gives me a wrong order.  Generally stuff is missing but we've had completely un related items substituted.   I've driven back to get the right items which I find very annoying. The assistant manager who dealt with my complaint( after the third time I thought they needed to know) did so slowly and fairly unapologetically.  Excuses about people quitting regularly.  The McDonald's up the road can deal with turnover while still delivering excellent reliability, so why can't they?

The pricing is generally high, imagine sort of paying full price for everything all the time. 

They did have a reasonable selection of Mother's Day flowers so they did save me time today. 

If it wasn't so darn convenient, I'd probably shop around more.

Restaurant food quality and service 2*, everything else 4-5. I'll round up, this time!"}
{"text":"I always pass by this MDE location and got excited to see there was a Starbucks inside. They sell a selection of grocery items (produce, fruit, canned goods, frozen stuff ..etc), but it's definitely not a full-scale grocery store. The prices of some things are slightly higher than a normal Giant supermarket. 

The good part of this MDE is that you can grab a freshly made lunch from the deli counter and get baked goods from the bakery. There's also a gas station connected to this, so you can get dinner, coffee and fill up on gas in one stop."}
{"text":"Imagine a Giant Eagle Market District miniaturized and this is what you get. 

I do have a nearby Market District Express in Harmarville but, it doesn't compare to this location at all. This location offers a Starbucks, deli, produce, pharmacy, bakery, sushi, beer and wine section and even a soup, salad and yogurt bar. The only thing really missing is a butchered meat section but, I guess that's what a regular Giant Eagle or Giant Eagle Market District is for. There is even a cafe where you can sit and relax

There is also a Get Go and a car wash out back so you can fill your and your cars belly at the same time.

Do not be mistaken as this IS NOT a full store but a compact version. For some things you will have to go to either the full sized Market District, Trader Joe's or The Fresh Market.

 I hope one of these eventually makes it to the eastern suburbs, cough Penn Hills, cough Monroeville, cough Wilkins Township. Just saying."}
{"text":"I go here very occasionally when I just can't deal with figuring out dinner. It's convenient if you live in the area and need a place to go that has innumerable options for your family after a long work day or an evening sport practice. Good menu for dine in I carry out, but this place is trying to be a sup√©rette and a restaurant at the same time. This is difficult to achieve when you have high turnover. I waited 20 Minutes for my meal of pulled pork and fries. They had let my meal sit for that long before I had to get up and fetch it myself. No apologies from the wait staff BUT Bob refunded the cash I paid for the meal. Thanks Bob."}
{"text":"This location is less about the groceries and more about the prepared foods/cafe/bakery/Starbucks. And beer. They have almost no meat in the case, but you can find whatever type of beer you might want. Having said that, the organic produce section has grown since they first opened, and the prepared foods are pretty good. I find myself stopping in fairly regularly, as it's within walking distance of my house so is super convenient for me. I still do most of shopping at the regular Market District in Bethel Park, but it's always nice to have a place this close when i realize I forgot that one ingredient for my veggie curry. And I happen to like Starbucks. And beer."}
{"text":"We visit this location often for quick grocery shopping, great service at Starbucks and the Monday night pizza special! The pizza is wood fired and really great."}
{"text":"Not bad, would like a better selection of ready to eat things other than CHICKEN! Ok chicken is popular, but have some of your hot bar items in the chilled section after you close it and please properly cool the food, dont throw it in a container still hot. As others have said Whole Foods does have a better selection. Now if GE is so big and good as they think they are then why would they care at all if a whole foods moved in. So what! GE is the largest chain around. Whole Foods is for a certain clientele, the standard GE customers are just that. I drive to shadyside to go to whole foods. If I am going to pay GE prices then its worth a drive to whole foods. Staffing is an issue for everyone as I have worked in food service for 30 years, and its not getting any better no matter how much you pay. People I know who have worked for GE dont like the work environment. The new GE looks nice like the one in Robinson, but with Fresh Market and Whole Foods it is a nice pleasant experience and the people are very nice. If you have a chance to go to a whole foods try the one in shadyside it is indeed a different group of people from what you will have at GE."}
{"text":"Trader Joes + Whole Foods + Giant Eagle + Food Court = Market District Express.

I was pretty surprised how much of this place is dedicated to prepared foods.  I initially thought it was going to be more of a small market to take care of quick grocery shopping.  Instead it seems more like a place that you can get a quick lunch or dinner for your family and pick up some of the  necessities for the fridge.  Being that the place is about 50% prepared foods its hard to give it a true rating since I didnt try much.  I only had a pizza, which was fresh, but not fantastic.  

Overall, I think it has potential as a good spot to stop by on a lunch break or for easy dinner options.  But time will tell if the quality of the prepared foods make this place a go-to spot."}
{"text":"Simply love this place. It's so close to my home. If I'm ever in a pinch for something or I run out of something, it is so convenient to drive across route 19 to get what I need. We also use it now also as our pharmacy. They also sell many different varieties of beer. There is also a nice outdoor seating area to dine at or read a book. It's a very unique experience. Their groceries and produce are always very fresh. The store is very clean. A nice bonus too is there is a Starbucks. 

Update:

I also want to mention they have a Starbucks in here. The staff is so friendly. They know my order. They strive to please you & they are fast."}
{"text":"I only go into this location occasionally to pick up a couple items. They seem to have a nice selection of food and ready to eat items and the store is always clean and well stocked. My only issue is that every single time I've gone in, I've either personally encountered or witnessed at least one rude or clearly disgruntled cashier - like DMV-level hostility towards customers and / or other workers. It's enough that I avoid this store unless it's my only feasible option."}
{"text":"Did the car wash today, and I was glad it was open on such a frigid day, but once again, not a very good wash . . . still had ice on my running boards and rear bumper after it was over, and lots of spots and dirt remained, especially on the sunroof.  Gave the gentleman guiding me in a tip, and he laughed at me (not sure how to read that).  Went inside to use the bathroom, and there are two sinks in the men's room, one had water and no soap, and the other had soap, but no water.  I also noticed that the staff inside the store seemed pretty grumpy, either not enough coffee, or maybe post-holiday irritation.  Even the sushi guys looked at me funny, Hmmmm?!?!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm grateful that there's somewhere in my neighborhood close by and convenient so that I can pick up a few things.  It's too small to be everything to everyone and it certainly falls short for me.  I wish they would do more organic and that the cafe was a little more sensitive to better ingredients prepared with today's information at hand.  For example... use nitrate free bacon in your cobb and other menu items.  It's been shown to score your arteries and causes arteriosclerosis.  It's not an opinion.  Giant Eagle should also have not hitched their stars to Starbucks and dared to create their own decent coffee program.  It's not rocket science and again you could have served a better product than Starbucks and not have taken all that space out of your store.  Maybe you could have served Swiss water process decaf and organic dairy to differentiate yourselves and to compete with Whole Foods whose opening is eminent.  So glad you were exposed for so shabbily trying to impede their opening.  I don't think I can ever really let this go and will happily soon never have to spend a penny with you again."}
{"text":"So far I'm really really happy this place opened up. It's a good size, carries all the necessary fresh fruits and veggies and the beer selection - oh my. It's perfect. I have yet to try the food but ill def come for lunch one of these days."}
{"text":"Loved the convenience of this place! Grab, lunch, dinner items , then gas and go. Very organized, fun place. I tried the Thai chicken wrap. It was very good along with a side of homemade chips."}
{"text":"This is a small place that holds lots of good things-including a Starbucks. They have a dining room which is always clean. They sell a lot of prepared foods and even have a small cafe that serves great food. They have a huge beer selection and a nice salad bar. They also have fresh flowers and a small selection of groceries. It's a great place to eat or meet for coffee. The atmosphere is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"I'm digging these Market District Express stores that Big Bird has started popping up in the area! Groceries, bakery, drugstore, hot foods, salad bar, sushi AND a really nice seating area to chill out. Definitely a good people watching spot"}
{"text":"Ok, so normally I'm pretty gushy and positive about most things.  But especially with the awful fight between GE and Whole Foods, I've been getting less than sparkly feelings about everything GE.  So, enter Market District Express.  We've eaten there about four times, and while the kids love it because they have crayons and coloring pages the food experience has been.....meh.  The dining area is decorated very nicely, and it really tries to deliver, but it's just missing something still.  The prices seem too high for eating in...well....a grocery store for goodness sakes.  I like that we can get beer & wine there, and there is a frozen yogurt mini bar, and they have fresh sushi and all sorts of prepared foods plus some staples but there's never been a time we've gone there and left thinking \"Yes, that was so good!  I'm glad we went there!\"  We've enjoyed live music, tried samples, and gotten a good survey of most things...but still, we're waiting for that one experience that makes it a place we really want to visit instead of \"Well, there's Market District Express if we can't think of anything else\"

Here are some more thoughts:

Lunch:
The salads are HUGE, and while they were pretty tasty, seemed overpriced.  The weighed salad bar has decent offerings and they make sushi on site with lots of prepackaged options.  We've had a couple of fails (grilled cheese sandwiches that hadn't been grilled long enough to melt the cheese inside, lukewarm pizzas and pretty fatty reubens) and some just OK meals.

Breakfast:
I really wish the kids loved the french toast because it's made with super thick yummy cinnamon bread and is wonderful.  We tried the corned beef hash which they cover with overcooked cheese that was not disclosed on the menu (yuck) and overall was surprisingly fatty.  Pancakes were OK."}
{"text":"Just writing the review cause I loved it,,stopped in for 1 thing. Ended up gabbing lunch and a starbuck.it was a few days before Xmas so it was perfect not to have  go in ,A big store. However market district in bethel park is my favorite store. Love it..no complaints..
Now why i wrote this and  I am speaking for a lot of other people..we would love to have a store like that across from St.clair hospital in mt.lebanon..people moved out here in this area because of the nice little shopping mall we had..we did a petition but didn't work. So Walgreen bought it and it has sat for 2/3 years now I heard they sold it to who I don't know..we would love to have a place like that and I guarantee you this would make good money in this early. People that worked at St clair were always over there shopping eating pizza whatever ..I hope you would consider looking into this property..I got so excited thinking and talking to neighbors about this and they asked me to work on this..I hope someone reads this and just looks..I would like to know if you do look at it and what would your opinion would be on this area..my name is Barb Swanson. Email is mooke@aol.com..please get back to me one way or another..
Thanks for taking the time for reading this..Barb Swanson"}
{"text":"Was not expecting this.  This store has a Starbuck, sushi, a cafe, a deli, a bakery, a mix and match veggie area, a pharmacy, coke machine with hundreds of flavors (like this!) soup and salad, Frozen Yogurt bar, fresh produce, and lots more. It is more a tiny GE Market District with more foodie/uniques and specialty grocery items.  You can get wine and beer by the glass in the cafe or take a growler or six pack (looked like over 100 varieties) with you.    We stopped in for some coffee and some sweets and ended up with that and a breakfast burrito and some sushi to go for lunch.."}
{"text":"I love this market district express, because you can get in and out of here quickly. They have all the basic produce, fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, breads, and snacks. They even have sushi, salad bar, cheeses, alcohol, hot foods, and a full kitchen and restaurant. 

I have had some of the food from the restaurant portion. They have seating inside and outside but you can also get it to go. A nice option if you are in a hurry for something for dinner. Overall, a great option if you just need a couple of items."}
{"text":"Wow I love these district markets they have everything I need. Lots of parking and a Starbucks right in the entrance plus lots of hot deli food. Pizza for $1.99 a slice is a good deal and they have a little dining area. It's nice they have a pharmacy Zane also a huge selection of food items. Biggest beer selection I've seen for a grocery store and nicest decor. Staff was great and helped me with directions to my next place.
Stop in my review doesn't do justice"}
{"text":"The cutest little giant eagle. They have a wonderful cafe and Starbucks. Staff is the best!!!!"}
