{"text":"Tried takeout from the restaurant. The food is decent. I enjoyed the shrimp pakora, crispy and flavourful.  They took care to punch holes in the container and through the bag so that the pakora did not go soggy. General Tao was a little soupy but lots of chicken with average flavour. Chicken with bamboo shoots and mushrooms was fresh but didn't enjoy the flavour; maybe not enough soy sauce?  Over all average food, but would try there again to get a sense of the other menu items.  I could see into the kitchen. Cooks looked happy and there were fresh vegetables that looked recently delivered.    Decor is a little tired looking. To help, they should take some pride in the appearance.  I recommend the staff clean the outside of windows, sweep up around the tables, and wipe down the front facing part of the bar."}
{"text":"Did some takeout today and the noodles are still spot on, a big serving.  The beef is more saucy and has more veggies.  The lunch special is now $6.50.  Most of the dishes are priced $1.00 to $1.50 more.  I'm understanding of this because well, the cost of living has increased, however, the value of the meat dishes is no longer there, especially since there is no side of rice.  The Singaporean noodle is average  value.  Hence the average 3.5* rating (3 is the only option) due to the above changes.  Still tastes good though!!!"}
{"text":"Best Hakka Chinese in the area . My favourites are shanghai noodles and chilli beef. Good portion n freshly cooked food !"}
{"text":"A good local hakka place for takeout.  I haven't tried a whole lot of the menu, but the veggie hakka noodles, chili chicken, crispy beef, sesame chicken, and pakoras are all solid choices!"}
{"text":"A restaurant very close to our place passed by many times but missed it every time  This chilli evening was hungry with a Chinese food craving and since this was so close Drove down there The interiors were not that good May be average  We went to the counter and there was a very rude and angry lady with a child on her shoulder She was very very obviously angry and rude to all customers  Thought she was the owner Not sure  We ordered Small hot and sour soup chilli lamb and veg shanghai noodles  AWESOME!!!!! Except for the hot and sour soup food was Really excellent!! Never had such awesome aroma Nd flavours in a while Loved the shangai noodles Really thick full of veggies and superb flavour  Chilli lamb was to die for too  The portion size was big too U know the food is good when ur stuffed and u still love thet food  Awesome amazing experience!!!  Definitely Ll go there again Nd often"}
{"text":"This spot is the Brampton equivalent of noodle wok in food quality and tremendous in terms of late night eats.  Super spot and great food! You gotta check it out, great for take out."}
{"text":"We had food to go. We were told the food would be ready in 20 mins. And we had to wait much much longer than that. Mind you, it was 3 pm on a Saturday and there were 3 people dinning in at the time.   Anyway, the food was okay. I do recommend the fish in black bean sauce."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after driving by it so many times.   I walked in with no major expectations - the place looks average, a little old but nothing too out of the ordinary given its location.   This is one of the few rare places that actually gives you huge portions! I ordered a vegetable shanghai noodles for only $7 and I swear the portion was at least 3 medium sized bowls... I didn't finish it of course and saved some for my boyfriend after and he didn't still finish it either!   The food is not AMAZING, I've had better but it's still pretty good - especially for the price. It's hard to find good restaurant in my area so I'll definitely be coming back more often!"}
