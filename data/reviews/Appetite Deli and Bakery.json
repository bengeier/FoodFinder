{"text":"The food is amaizing and actually quite cheap. no better place ive found to get some lunch. get a sandwich and a salad for under 10$  The broccoli salad will make you weep.  I fantasize about that damn broccoli salad.  I cannot say enough about how good this place is."}
{"text":"Sandwiches always taste better when they're made with the best ingredients, which is true of the sandwiches at Appetite.  Totally unassuming from the outside, but really great food!  I like that they have a variety of side salads to accompany their sandwiches ranging from pasta salad to quinoa."}
{"text":"I've been to Appetite dozens of times now. I've had the cupcakes and muffins from the bakery and sandwiches from the deli. The cupcake was amazing and the muffins were good as well. I love the sandwiches on their pretzel bun. Unfortunately, they usually mess up my sandwich more times than not which is disappointing, however, when they do make it right it's so good that it keeps me coming back. The staff is always really nice although the service is slow, especially in the evenings."}
{"text":"So I have been eating here since the two brothers opened back in 2005 and it is good to see that they are doing well. Try them, you will love them! Chef Bennett is the cake God. He has an amazing butter cream. They just make things look so easy here, like they have been doing this for 50 years. Try them try their breakfast sandwiches they wont disappoint you."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, a touch slow though. Id like to go back and try a granola bowl and one of the huge pastries."}
{"text":"The initial disappointment I felt upon realizing I'd forgotten my lunch at home was almost immediately assuaged by the thought of Appetite Deli.  I had never been inside, but I had heard about it through you yelpers.  I walked in feeling like I was going on a camping trip and needed to stock up. I mean, I am a person who needs to eat at least every two hours, and it was 9:30 and I needed to make it through lunch and then some.  The guy behind the deli counter was really nice, and offered some suggestions.  He also pointed me to the bakery section, because I mentioned I would need both breakfast and lunch.  I ended up ordering a coffee, a raisin scone, and the \"Veggie Delight\" sandwich on wheat (havarti, avocado, cucumber, sprouts, tomato, mayo, and dijon) with a side of fruit salad. The whole thing came to less than ten bucks.  Everything tasted wonderfully fresh.  The coffee was very good too!  Also, I hadn't realized this when I ordered, but I think the sandwiches (which you can order by the half as well) come with a type of salad for a reduced price. Not to mention a delicious pickle.   I was impressed by the relaxed atmosphere, as well as the numerous types of bread offered here. I'd be interested in coming back to try, oh, I don't know, EVERYTHING else!  I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Great deli/bakery that I've been fervently hoping to survive in the dreaded Lyndhurst strip. Good thing it has.  Excellent baked goods all across the board, from their specialty epi bread to their modestly decorated, yet completely delicious cupcakes. And the regular cakes. Get them. You will not be disappointed.  The deli side of things is good, but not as good. Fairly broad selection (not sure if they still have their \"Worlds Best Sandwich\" I highly recommend it) of sandwiches and more traditional deli fair. Decent preconcieved sandwiches, and good soups and chowder.  Really nice atmosphere, too. Oh! I think they started catering recently, and their prices are VERY good for what you get."}
{"text":"The Cuban sammich is holy-shizz-damn good!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for some time.  I live less than 10 minutes away and drive by all the time.  I stopped in for lunch on the go and really glad that I did!  I ordered the Brieze sandwich on a croissant.   You can also choose white, wheat, sourdough, and pretzel.  The sandwich included smoked ham, Brie, sliced granny smith apple, fresh spinach and mustard.....it was very good.  I ordered a whole sandwich, but could have ordered half....which was more than sufficient.  This sandwich was a steal at $  6.25.  The next time I would order w/ honey mustard and have it panini'd.  There was also homemade soup and baked goods. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"miss them. was yummy. if only they had better marketing for their catering side maybe they would have stayed? i dont know where the owners work now. charles ramsey (cleveland hero) worked there too!"}
{"text":"After having driven by this place many times, I figured I'd check it out on my first night of \"me time\" in awhile.  When I walked up to the counter, the gentleman behind the counter offered me an ice water while I was looking at the menu and bakery counter (as I'm a sucker for bakery).  As soon as I opened the menu, I saw The Brieze - ham, apple, spinach, onion, and Brie - and knew it was a match made in heaven.  I tried The Brieze on the pretzel bun - what a great combination!  While the bakery case was low (as it was pretty late in the day when I got here), I still managed to pick up 2 cheese danishes to take back home and share with my husband.  The sandwich and staff here were great, and I'll have to check back in after those danishes.    The only downfall, in my opinion, is that there isn't wi-fi available, whereas the bigger named deli/bakery places in the area have it.  But for a local deli and bakery, I'm glad I stopped in as it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch/ brunch! They got some great options for vegetarians and limited breakfast menu is served all day. I got the vegetarian breakfast sandwich (Served on toast, bagel, croissant or tortilla) with fruit and coffee. It was simple and delicious! I loved it!!!  Their salads looked yummy, I will definitely try them next time. They have different combination offers as well. They got decent coffee and great prices. Service is friendly - I will definitely be back.   Location - Opposite side of the road from Aldi on Mayfield road. It can be easily missed but definitely a \"Gem\" :)"}
{"text":"Appetite is exactly the type of establishment Lyndhurst has needed for years. Part deli, part bakery, they also offer catering. Owned and primarily run by two brothers, Appetite is perfect for a freshly made and quick breakfast, lunch or early dinner.    From the outside, you'd have no idea this little gem exists. It's tucked in a strip mall alongside the bustling Mayfield Road. From the second you walk in, you can smell the freshly prepared artisan breads, danishes, gooey cinnamon rolls and muffins cooking in the A.M. During lunch hour, the soups and grilled panini sandwiches dominate the deli's aroma.   Appetite prides themselves on fresh and homemade. Along with the variety of bakery goods, homemade soups and custom sandwiches, they also offer an extensive selection of about a dozen or so salads.   For the lunch crowd, combinations are offered. Appetite's version of the Combo Meal is called the \"Lunch Box\", and it includes a sandwich, side, pickle, cookie and soda for $8.50. For the lighter diner, 1/2 Sandwich & Cup of Soup can be had for $5.50.   Next time you're in the area, Appetite is definitely worth checking out. This type of establishment is unique to the area and the quality these two brothers pump out of their Deli/Bakery is second to none."}
{"text":"Appetite offers a smorgasboard of deli and bakery options - from breakfast sandwiches to holiday catering, and everything in between. There are two parts to the restaurant - the deli - where you can get sandwiches, soups, and many different sides - and the bakery, where there are breads and desserts. I particularly enjoy the caprese sandwich. It's flavorful and the bread is great. I've had quite a few of the pastries and desserts and really like the brownies. Even the pickiest of eaters should find something to eat here since the chefs are so accommodating."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a rather generic strip mall on Mayfield, Appetite is owned by two brothers, and they are the nicest family-owned business guys I've met. It's a good place for lunch and their catering service can't be beat for ease of use and price point.  The deli part of this place is outstanding -- very good sandwiches on hearty breads, very friendly service. I really haven't sampled any of their bakery, but I have witnessed them doing tastings with prospective wedding cake clients and it always looks delicious and makes me wish for a wedding just so I can eat cake. They also package up the \"waste product\" from their cakes and sell containers as a sort of trifle. Again, always looks awesome and indulgent.  I have had Appetite cater veggie and cheese trays for my annual cookie exchange party two years in a row and I can't say enough good things about them. First of all, yeah, I know it's costlier to buy veggie trays than it is to buy a bunch of vegetables and chop them up, but I'm willing to pay for the convenience considering I host 40+ people every year.   Second, I've priced trays and Appetite is less expensive than even the chain grocery stores in my area. Which is all right by me; I'd rather support the little guy, and essentially they're providing the exact same produce as the other places would. And it's fine quality.  Ordering has never been a problem, and neither has pick-up and they are pretty amenable to special requests (within reason, I guess would be the caveat). This year I asked for them to leave the crackers off the cheese tray and I'd pay the difference for the extra cheese. They did so and also threw in the crackers in a separate basket. And they have always provided an extra container of dip for the veggie trays, which is a nice touch in my book.  Again, nice guys, good food, good customer service. Just about all you can ask for! Stop in and have a Bacon Bird for lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on January 26th with the wife just to check it out in hopes that she may have a new hidden secret for those early Saturday mornings.  I think Appetite may fit the bill just fine.  I bought a pepperoni and provolone pastry and she went with a peanut butter / brownie cupcake and we both loved each of our little treats.  I was amazed on how fluffy the pastry was and she absolutely devoured hers within minutes and was already planning the next trip this weekend for breakfast.    I've driven by probably 150 times and finally stopped in thanks to the wonderful reviews on Yelp, so happy I did.  Once again it really shows the knowledge, honesty, and accuracy of most reviews on Yelp.  Thanks all!"}
{"text":"The Cuban on a pretzel roll is to die for. I can't sing its graces enough!! I will never be able to tell you anything about any of their other food because I will never try anything other than the Cuban!! I did get a side of their Greek salad which was also yummy, but had too many onions - ick!! My husband has tried other sandwiches and has always said they are good but his eyes don't roll into he back of his head like mine do when I bite into the Cuban!!"}
