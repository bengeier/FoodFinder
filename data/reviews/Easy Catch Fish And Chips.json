{"text":"We got a haddock and chips and the fish tacos. 
The quality is just ok. The batter is a bit soggy, the fish didn't have much fish flavor. Portion size is small for the price. The fries are just so so.

On the upside, the place is clean, service is great!

Fish Street Market on Yonge north of Eglinton has much better fish and chips in the city for much cheaper."}
{"text":"After one Saturday night hunt for a fish and chips restaurant that didn't close before 8pm, found this place and was really impressed! The fish is great and the fries are even better. Each time I've been there hasn't been anyone else here but I don't know why! It's great food. A really cool atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips but not a wow. The ketchup bottles are grungy. The service staff were helpful. The rooms is decorated with tinsel and ornamental Christmas balls...what is with that?"}
{"text":"The fish and salad came straight from the local no frills.. frozen fish, bagged salad.  Might have changed management cause we ate here once before and it was pretty good back then.  Fries are ok."}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised to have a better than decent fish and chips joint in my hood. It's right beside Holy Chick so I can imagine they'll be a nice alternative for lunch goers who would still want to indulge but on something a little less red. 
I came upon them today as I was on my way to Aroma, but as I saw a young and cold staffer passing out breaded fish samples, I figured she should at least have someone try them for all her effort. I walked in and the atmosphere is accommodating. Menu and order desk upon entering, but the double door thing walking in was, well, weird. Other than that, their color scheme was appropriately aquatic and the choices were simple and easy to choose from. I went for the po'boy sandwich: made w Saba, on a skinny sub bun, pretty well cooked and lightly breaded, it was enjoyable. The chips could've used an extra second in the fryer, as they were just a bit too firm, and could've used a touch more seasoning.
Will try them again."}
{"text":"I came to Yonge & St. Clair on a Sunday night in hopes of trying Holy Chuck but they were closed by 8pm. I stumbled upon this place, saw 'Clam Chowder' and was sold. 

For two people, we spent $45 + tip - which hurt my heart. Wasn't expecting to spend so much on a casual dinner... My s/o ordered a lobster roll with a side of fries, and clam chowder - lobster roll ($13.95) was okay but small, and the fries were good and the portion was pretty big.. I ordered the haddock fish tacos (as recommended by the cashier) and clam chowder on the side - the fish tacos ($12.95) were OKAY. I've had better... there wasn't much flavor in the fish or the coleslaw. The clam chowder was one of the better ones I've eaten in restaurants in Toronto. 

The cashier was nice and friendly. Very helpful. 

The restaurant itself was okay... there were a few bugs which didn't gross me out, but I'm sure would gross out other people. This may have been because the door was open. The setting was funky and the cleanliness was okay. Not sure if I'd come back again considering the price of the food."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when looking to satisfy my hankering for some Friday fish n' chips. The dine in experience was positive - the restaurant was clean, the food was good and the staff was friendly. I guess you could say I'm hooked (pun intended)."}
{"text":"Not the best fish and chips I've had, but still good. It's very spacious and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I've been better year ago and it was great then.  I went back last week and it was horrible!  I ordered the cod and the batter didn't even stick to the fish and it literally went soggy after I just had two bites & they used pre-packaged salad that I got at food basic so that was also a big turn off so avoid this place at all cost!!!  The staff were nice though.  I gave this a 1 star cuz the fries were good & the two female staffs were friendly, that's all."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today. Josh was the gentleman behind the counter. Brilliant service, extremely personable, the food was excellent! I couldn't have been more pleased and will be stopping jn regularly as I work 20 steps away."}
{"text":"Please take into account that this review is based on just this one time first experience with Easy Catch.  I came here to order a clam chowder soup to go.  I was first questioned by the girl behind the counter with, do I want a red one or a white one.  I asked what's the difference and she said the red one is a tomato base and the white is cream base.  I'm used to eating creamy clam chowder so I asked for that.  Within a minute after I paid, my name was called out to pick up my order.  I took the soup back to work, opened up the bag, and some soup were leaking out of the container.  This was not a problem, but it was the \"red\" one.  I still gave it the benefit of the doubt hoping it would still taste good even though they gave me the wrong soup.  Annnd it wasn't...it would've tasted the same if I'm eating straight out of a can of tomato sauce.  Two stars for their quick service nonetheless (then again, I just ordered a scoop of soup to go), and for having a decent variety on their menu that makes me think one day, possibly giving them another chance when I'm in the mood for something deep fried and oily."}
{"text":"Pretty good fish and chips, it's not greasy but the hali-bites (bite-sized halibut) had too much batter content due to the smaller 'bites'. I'll go for the normal Halibut next time (same fish portion size). I did like the sweet chili thai sauce, but I don't think I'd ever choose it over their tartar sauce (the sweet chili thai I reserved instead for dunking fries). I wasn't so hot on the fries, I can't fault them but nothing particularly special either.

The restaurant has quite a bit of room for seating and is very clean and new. The pickup counter gives you a look into their kitchen which I also found to be clean. Service is excellent. They'll call your order by name and I was also asked how my meal was, despite the fast food layout. Maybe because it's new and they're looking for any feedback (they also have a prominently displayed comment box at the front).

All fish orders include fries (substitutable with another side, some for an extra charge) and tartar sauce.

They have free wifi - the password is 'zelden17'. ;)"}
{"text":"I usually bring a lunch during the week when I'm in the office and Friday is my day to eat out.  I'd heard that Easy Catch Fish and Chips recently opened around the corner from where I work so I checked it out today.  It's in a former pizza/shawarma restaurant.

I ordered haddock 'n chips and a Diet Pepsi.  You place your order when you walk in and then pick it up at the kitchen window when your name is called.  Emily took my order and she was friendly and chatty.  

It's a big portion ... good value for the cost.  The fish was flavourful.  The batter was light with a bit of a crisp and I didn't find it overly greasy.  The fries were good too.

You should check it out when you are craving fish 'n chips."}
{"text":"cozy place, good space. Staff is very fun and friendly and helpful. Fish was fantastic. Not best I've had but very very good, I ate it up pretty fast. Cole slaw was great too. No complaints, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Small counter service seafood place on Yonge south of St. Clair. Nice fish selection and plenty of sides choices. I had a delicious breaded halibut sandwich and the best onion rings I've had in a long time. Comfy seating. Not licensed. Friendly, fast service and the prices are reasonable. I plan to return."}
{"text":"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat sour coleslaw.  Nice to find somewhere that makes a non-mayo coleslaw and makes it so good

Fish sandwich is nondescript and as for the lobster roll, well, can something be salty yet bland at the same time?  But hot damn those onion rings were inspiring

$16 with no drink?  Getting pricey my friends"}
{"text":"Bathrooms disgusting,tons of fruit flies, dirty floors and over filled garbage . Fish and chips ..... Tasteless :( sorry but true. $60'for 3 orders of flavourless fish and soggy chips"}
{"text":"Unfortunate disappointment. Had potential to be a once-a-week lunch spot, nothing special. Haddock was tasteless, spongey and over-battered (though I should have ordered Halibut). Had few mouthfuls of the  soggy paper the fish is served on. Great fries. Awesome hot apple cider, if almost too sweet. But they def have some links to iron out or they won't last long."}
