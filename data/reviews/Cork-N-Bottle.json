{"text":"It was my first time visiting Cork -N- Bottle, the experience was ok. Based on the name you would think it was a wine bar or at least has a decent wine selection but when I asked the server for a wine list so looked at me as I had 3 heads.  Not to mention she was very short and rude with us while taking the orders/answering questions about the menu.  We sat outside on the patio which was nice, but the outside speakers were turn way to low I couldn't even hear the music I played on TouchTunes.  If they can't turn it up because of some sort of noise ordinance they don't have them outside at all so I wouldn't assume I can play and hear music outside."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I got into a one sided fighting match with the \"owner\" where she screamed all sorts of racist comments, made other patrons apologize for her behavior, and then eventually told me I was ghetto and she is tired of ppl like me! Absolutely disgusted With this establishment and will make sure I no longer (or my family) supports this business again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Cool spot to hang out. Decent bar food.  Fun atmosphere would recommend for late night drinking."}
{"text":"First time back there in about 15 years. We had a bartender named Jen,she was really good and it was pretty busy. Well we had a good time so we came back a few days later [8-15-16] and got a  different bartender,she was not very good,no personality,no sense of humor. She didn't even tell us her name,didn't ask what we wanted on our food,next time we will call first and make sure Jen is working,if we knew the other girls name we would just not go there when she was working."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was my local watering hole for a LOT of years. Good food, good staff and cheap. Whether you want a beer, or a LOT of beer check this place out."}
{"text":"Great local dive bar. Beer selection is very strong and prices are great. They always have drink specials during sporting events. Mondays is half priced pizza and calzones. The pizza is great! Probably the best in the area. If you have not tried the pizza it is a must. Only annoying part is all the nurses from the clinic that come and smoke outside the entrance. If you've never been to the Cork stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because their corned beef sandwich was so ridiculously good I can't even contain myself.   The wings were very good, the fried green beans were good, the french fries were just ok. The bartender was a sweetheart. Ok beers on tap, hoppiest was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, so it could maybe use a Stone or a Fat Heads tap.  But the corned beef. Holy crap. Rye was flat-top cooked with butter. Stadium mustard and swiss. The corned beef was so juicy. Just enough on the sandwich. Not too fatty,  but not too lean. Perfect. 5 star sandwich."}
{"text":"Very good food. Always great service. Wanda is best.Welcome to Alexandra. Try the baked Greek wings."}
{"text":"Cork-N-Bottle has been around for decades and is one of the best food options if you are visiting Hillcrest hospital. Great prices, a tasty bar-food menu, and Keno if you want to test your luck!  Walking into CNB you see a great patio outside and a large bar inside, with some high tops, booths and a side room for more restaurant style seating. I would consider more of a bar than a restaurant but don't let that fool you into thinking the food isn't good.   My co-workers and I come here for lunch a couple times a month and between the group of us we have seen/had just about everything on the menu. People rave about their pizza, and I can attest that it is well worth the price, but I prefer their burgers or their wraps. I am a basic burger guy and CNB makes them just how i want them. The buffalo chicken or chicken cesar wraps are my go-to's if I'm not in the burger mood. The creamy-ness of the cesar dressing or the spice of the buffalo sauce really make them both. The wings have been hit or miss the few times I have got them but when they hit they are a home run, especially the Greek wings. The side salad is also huge, if you want a somewhat healthy side.  My co-workers usually get the fish fry because the portion is large and the coke slaw is good but they also love the Roman burger sub and the Cork bigger boy. The Roman burger sub comes with grilled salami and capicola that just add a ton of flavor to each bite and the Cork bigger boy is a double cheese burger with cork sauce that reminds me of the old big boy burgers. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu from what I have seen. We also love to throw a couple bucks down on Keno and watch our numbers while we eat.   The most glaring negative about Cork-N-Bottle are the parking lot, which you notice right away. The location is convenient but the parking lot is congested and very difficult to pull out of with traffic. If you are at the hospital, walk over. The only other area of improvement is service at lunchtime. Sometimes they just seem understaffed with the bartender being the only server on the floor."}
{"text":"Liked going their for the patio, but then one of the bartenders was really rude.  Haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"Stopped in twice while we were at the hospital having are son, very conveniently located when you are sick of hospital food.  I would say it is your typical bar food, all of which is very reasonable priced for the portion size and the drinks are also not going to break the bank.  The pizza and burgers were very good and will definitely try again if we are near by. Apps are mostly fried with a few fresh options. We tried the greek wings which were not bad but really nothing special and the greek seasoning was not even noticed all they tasted like was lemon.   Service was good and bad. The good bar tenders are very attentive and i never had an empty glass, the bad is that both times i went and ordered take out they forgot one of the things i ordered. Order #1 they forgot my greek wings which i was not charged for and really did not miss because we ordered to much food. Order #2 they draught my food out and i double checked it this time because of the prior nights issue and low and behold my cheese anf bacon fries were missing. I told the bar tender who quickly remedied the problem and did not charge me for the fries that were out in less then 5 min.  All in all for the first 2 times i have been to Cork & Bottle it was a good experience and a very pleasant change from hospital food that costs more with not drinks at all."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot.  The Bleu cheese salad dressing surprised me...very good.  The pizza is solid ..Crust is killer good.  Mixed crowd on the weekend.  Great service at the bar."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for a quick drink to a dinner with the family to watching the game. Not real huge inside. So seating may be limited. Parking lot is tight too. Sometimes hard to get in and out of as well.   Food is pretty good. Pizzas are good. Salads are good-nice portions. Sandwiches like the burgers are good too. Cannot complain about the food. And you get a good portion for your money. Drinks are not expensive either. Good bar.   Here is what makes this place less than 5 stars. It's the service. It's not that the wait staff is not nice or accommodating. It's that I've been here on more than 1 occasion and been at a table, and no one has come to the table at all. To get drinks or anything. We've had to go to the bar and ask for menus and drinks. Then we've been left along for the majority of the meal. No refills or to take away plates or get napkins. Nothing. And it's happened multiple times. Even when they aren't that busy.   So my family and I do go back. But it's a roll of the dice. We going to get service today or no?"}
{"text":"They have delicious pizza,one of the best in Cleveland area. Large pizzas are half off on Mondays,even speciality pizzas,even takeout orders! Its a neighborhood dive bar, a lot of regulars,usually older crowd. The parking here is horrible. The also have really good wings and a greek gyro platter."}
{"text":"Dive bar, for sure.  I've only been at lunchtime - but the beer selection would not get me to come after work.  ANYWAY - I digress...  I'm a huge fan of the lunch specials.  A few of us from work come here like clockwork (yes, I'm betting you COULD set your watch based on our arrival) on Fridays.  Monday through Friday, they have 4 daily specials.  Sandwich and fries, or a salad for $5.  FIVE BUCKS.  Our pathetic little group consistently gets the french dip on Fridays.  Yes... all four of us.    And, can I say it??  I would not typically order a salad from a dive bar.  I'd picture crappy veggies, and probably icky iceberg lettuce.  My girlfriend ordered a salad, and I was looking at it with lots of interest.  So much so that she started moving her plate closer to her side of the table.  :)    The waitstaff is interesting.  The one regular girl is quick, and understands that we are on lunch, and hustles our stuff to us, and gets refills and checks out quickly.  Luckily, we usually get her. She's a cutie.  The OTHER girl... well... ummm...  yeah.  This past summer... she wore very VERY short jean skirts.  So short in fact, that when she came out onto the patio, walking towards our table, we could CLEARLY see her hot pink panties (god, I DETEST that word) flashing at us from under the skirt.  My buddy that was sitting eye level to her crotch as she came sashaying up to the table is still excited.  So, there ya go.    If you go on a Friday, you'll see us there around 12:15.  We are a loud and happy bunch.  Say hi!  :)"}
{"text":"This is your typical hole in the wall bar! The food is ok and so are the drinks and the prices are cool, but the customer service sucks. They also have one annoying female that works there and she seems as if she is either thirsty for attention or needs to take meds for ADHD! Every time I've gone there she was loud, using the \"F\" word while speaking to fellow employees and also regular customers that she was cool with! If it weren't for her I'd probably consider going back and perhaps giving this place another star!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are rude. I went once since I work at the hospital right next-door. But now I've stopped to avoid their crass behavior."}
{"text":"Little bar next to the hospital. Service was pretty bad but the food was good and the drinks are the cheapect in town. I may go there again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious. The pepperoni was awesome! The sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs. The sauce is thick and sweet which I like. Tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward. Not their fault. I didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so I can't say what it's like to eat in."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch special - grilled cheese and Italian wedding soup for $6. Soup was very flavorful and sandwich was perfectly browned."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place bc my step daughter raved about it. The food was good. The service was a 0. Will never return. The manager got an attitude with me swore at me. You call yourself a great establishment? Go bsck to charm school and learn some manners!"}
{"text":"LISTEN! I like the atmosphere MOST of the time but TONIGHT, I had the pleasure of listening to the 2 regulars at the end of the bar WITH an employee talking about either an employee and/or another customer and DANG it, I doesn't care!  (Yeah, I meant the bad grammar) I want to come here to unwind, forget my crummy day, not listen to someone else's issues cuz ya know what? I got 99 problems and you ain't one of 'em.  Zippy. Quiet. Stop. Enough. Really?  No banging on the bar. No gossiping. Please. Eeeenough."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on New Years because we had passed it several times before without going in. I was surprised to find that it was not a dive bar but a nicely put together, local hang out. The people inside seemed like regulars. The bar selection was average and the bartenders were responsive. Probably not a place I'll go back to but a fun, different experience to have."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends for a drink and some food. Even open early for breakfast at 9AM, and 7 days a week. How can you go wrong with that? Only downside, when it's busy, parking isn't the best."}
{"text":"Yessssss, another Mayfield dive bar.  I went there with a female friend for some pre partying and something to put in my stomach before going to hang in Beachwood. Beachwood is kind of growing on me, yeah it can be snobbish and some people really take themselves way too seriously, but I still have fun.  One thing that really disappointed me was, no nurses. How the fcuk do you have bar pretty much in the middle of a hospital and there are no F'n  nurses.   Dive not as much as it used to be but still a dive bar attached to a pizza joint.  Good happy hour. Xmas ale on draft in January Lots of smokers outside Good Jukebox Not too much riff-raff Open on Sundays Very large bar 2 dollar beer specials Did not see too many Chachis  Ahh yes the makings of another dive bar!  Lets get serious now.    The weeding soup was fantastic, lots of meatballs, shredded chicken and greens.   This is the way it's supposed to be.  My guest and I for sure thought it was going to be from Sysco,  nope it was homemade.  Saw a pizza come out and it looked really good. Did not eat any, but If had to bet, I would bet it was pretty good!  Next, the hot wings,  They were standard bar wings, crispy, plump and your typical Franks Red Hot Sauce flavor. Not greasy sauce.  Guess what? That is the way I like them.  The service was a bit slow at  1st and they were changing shifts, but once they caught up it was all good!  The bathroom sink had just broken so they had some hand sanitizer  Sorry I can't do that stuff, period.  So they let me use one of the sinks where they wash the dishes. I was completely OK with that.  But I'll tell you what, I was forshizzle not going to shake one dudes hand in that place. I'm not a germ-a-phobe but I prefer good old  soap and water."}
{"text":"I live in Mayfield Heights and decided to finally try this place. It's bigger than I expected but is indeed a hole-in-the-wall bar. We went on a Sunday evening and the music was obnoxiously loud. I could barely hear the person sitting across from me. We seated ourselves and no one came to wait on our table for at least 10 minutes. It looked like only 2 people were working (both behind the bar). The beers are cheap which is nice, but the food is moderately priced.   Drink -- I got a bottled beer and was offered a glass to go with it which I accepted. The glass however was frosted. Any beer lover knows that this is just incorrect. By putting a beer in a frozen cold glass you take away the flavor and smell of the beer and create unnecessary foam in your beer.   Food -- My friend got a basic side salad, which was moderately sized and tasted fine. We both got calzones and they were okay. No ricotta cheese, which by definition, is the main ingredient of a calzone. So technically we were eating stromboli. We both felt kind of sick to our stomachs all night though. My other friend got a burger which was also just meh, okay. Maybe the pizza would have been a better choice.   Probably won't go back here. 2/5, would not recommend.  I'll stick to the Fox and Hound across the street."}
{"text":"After a long afternoon of medical testing over at the hospital next door, my hungry family could not wait another minute to eat, so in we went to this long-established, local watering hole.  The mixed drinks were good and strong! Very reasonable menu prices. Nice mix of customers, in the late afternoon. Could not swear to it, but I think their excellent fries may be house-made. The fries and the delicious onion rings gave the good, hot sandwiches we ordered extra substance. The fries and onion rings would have been great on their own with whatever, on the bar tab. Add fast service, nice server and a huge TV with ESPN, to ourselves, and we were happy Cork-and-Bottlers.  All smoking is only permitted outside, of course-hold your breath and run fast if you are a sensitive, non-smoker entering the bar, or even their parking lot. Otherwise, someone may be wheeling you back to the ER, next door."}
{"text":"What can I say, the cork is a neighborhood institution.  This place is busy everyday of the week.  They serve typical bar food but have outstanding pizza and wings.  The greek wings are some of the best I ever had.  There is usually a special every night.  The bar staff is friendly and the crowd is always interesting."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great staff, food and atmosphere. Competitive drink specials every day! Parking is a little tight, so that's the only downfall. If you go while it is packed, there is parking nearby within a short walk.  It's definitely worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"went in for the first time after over 20 yrs. asked for hot tea.(no hot tea).it is a bar & restaurant. had coffee (with curdled cream) the waitor never asked if i wanted anything else. waited over 20 minutes for wedding soup. told the waiter we were leaving,not having a good experience. i will not return... ccf should have torn down the bar also...just sayin...."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Sunrise special: two eggs, a pile of bacon, hash browns and toast just $5.99. Tasted better than Bob Evans breakfast. I  will be back!"}
{"text":"Um.. excuse me. When did the Cork n Bottle become a real bar?? They went from super divey, to a pretty classy joint. They put in a floor, got some nice handblown glass lampshades, and put in a nice patio. The drinks are cheap, and the pizza is really good. They also serve food late, so its a great place to meet your late night hunger needs."}
{"text":"Their food is great, especially their pizza. The service on the phone leaves something to be desired, but I overlook it for the good food."}
{"text":"This is the place I would go if I was a nurse from Hillcrest.  It's small, good music on the juke, decent food, and has a lot of fun potential.  Yeah, I know the Fox and Hound is right across the street but I'd settle for a heavy hand and scratch off lottery / KENO before fuzzy butt, loud, obnoxious, can't hear the person next to me, kind of madness you get at the Fox.  Don't get me wrong, there's a time and place for everything, but M-W I'll take CNB over FNH any day.  Back to the food.  I've had the pizza, burger once, steak sandwich once, and wings, all I've enjoyed and a good price.  Parking could be a little better seeing I drive a F150 but I'll find a spot and pony up to the bar for a drink and wings again soon.  The owner is usually there too which is always nice to see.   Darts and a dance floor are also there for you to enjoy.  Check out the pics http://www.cork-n-bottle.com/index.htm."}
{"text":"Was visiting someone in the hospital. Stopped by for supper. Parking was very limited. The food was excellent. Service so-so.  Had pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a beer and sports tv.  The food is above average and very reasonable.  My only problem is the wine selection is terrible so it is difficult to get my wife to go. Please upgrade some of your wines!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've become a frequent patron due to its proximity to my job. The service is spotty sometimes. But the drinks are good, they are cheap, and the food is spot on bar food. Their pizza is great -- the cheddar jalapeno poppers alone have me coming back. I've consumed 3 orders this week. ..."}
{"text":"Cork and bottle is a local hang out for pizza and beer. It's also a regular place for people to have their midnight pizza run. Their pizza is actually very good and their beer is in expensive so I see why this place is always packed. I wouldn't call this a dive bar, but I also wouldn't come here dressed up. They have plenty of televisions to watch the game on. I don't think I would come here on a date but I can see a group of friends watching games here or stopping for pizza after a concert or something."}
{"text":"We go in for their delicious burgers and salad. Have always had good service and good food. We used to go here in the 70's and it's still here. Relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks  Staff was very friendly Love the juke box Bathrooms clean Great vibe Love the place"}
{"text":"Really good Pizza. Half price on Monday. Great sandwiches and wings. Nice bar and good service. Prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend the Cork. Biggest problem is the parking."}
