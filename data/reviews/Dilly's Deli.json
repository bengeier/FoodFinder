{"text":"I've tried this place on two occasions and was disappointed both times. I ordered the Gobbler and the Smokey Mountain (they got my order wrong) and both were just not that great to me. My boyfriend really likes this place, but I just don't see it. Idk if I'm ordering the wrong things, but it can't be that hard to make a good sandwich. Le sigh."}
{"text":"Been there just once & found it satisfactory.
I specifically liked the soup-in-bread-bowl idea a lot. The sandwiches were good too."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten here.   My daughter ordered the sandwich for me.   Based on the time stamp on the receipt it took them 20 minutes to make the sandwich.     The restaurant was EMPTY. Found the sandwich unappetizing so I probably won't be going back.    Additionally, the staff was incredibly slow.  It reminded me of the sloths in the movie Zootopia.  The young man at the register seemed out of it and frequently was just staring into space. 

My daughter and son in law have eaten there in the past.    Their experience today was much worse.   Apparently, the printer was not working and the staff were unaware of orders until the customers complained.  A man who appeared to be in a manager/supervisor capacity was very unprofessional.   Although, he was aware of the printer issue, his response was \"how are we supposed to know if you didn't get your order unless you tell us\".   Apparently, that was his solution to deal with a technology glitch.   Instead of proactively taking action to identify the orders affected, he would rather have customers upset and unhappy.   Although, he ultimately refunded what they paid for their order, his attitude indicated that the customers were at fault."}
{"text":"When I moved to Chandler from Scottsdale I was so excited to see a Dilly's was in the area. However, I have been to the Chandler location about three times now. It's okay. It's not worth returning to and definitly not as good as the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I would come back. I got the half sandwich and small soup. The rye bread was really good. I liked the cream cheese they used in the sand which. I also like the coke machine they have."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a staple for my office.  The food is always good and if you order ahead you can walk right up to the counter and your food will be ready without any waiting.  The only bad thing is the food is so good sometimes there are no seats but the table changeover is quick so just wait a couple of minutes and a chair will open up."}
{"text":"Well clearly I'm a glutton for punishment because even though I've had numerous poor meals here in the past, I really want to like this place. I said I was done with them, but I'm weak. There is a severe lack of locally owned restaurants in this area so I'm really trying, but I can't like them if I can't get in the door! I tried to give them yet another chance two weeks ago (June 19th) only to pull up around 5pm to see a sign on the door saying they were closing early. I was annoyed, but I didn't mind giving Chipotle next door my money instead. But wait, it gets better. 

I tried again the other day (July 3rd) only to see another \"CLOSED EARLY\" sign! I guess the 4th of July holiday had to start a day early. Honestly this is ridiculous. If you want to be closed early in the summer, then make up some new official summer hours. Or at least type out a professional sign instead of hand writing one with a crayon."}
{"text":"My original review of this place was very good. I have decided to edit it because since posting the review I haven't received the best food. The last few times I've come here, the soup was only luke warm. Nothing is worse than cold soup (OK, maybe a few things are worse...) I have a rule that I will never send food back because of fear that the servers or kitchen staff will do something to it. Instead I just write reviews on here. The soup was my favorite part of coming to Dilly's Deli. I was obsessed with the creamy chicken noodle soup so I am a bit disappointed in Dilly's for this.

The sandwiches though are consistently great. All ingredients look and taste very fresh. I get the Dilly Bird. On my own, I would never put cream cheese on a sandwich but it is a great compliment to the other ingredients on the Dilly Bird.

I would recommend giving this place a shot but don't be surprised if the soup isn't hot."}
{"text":"First time in, the menu is different from most places. The sandwiches were surprisingly very delicious. Definitely some thought put into it. House made cookies were very sweet and moist."}
{"text":"The most delicious Sandwich to grace my mouth with its savory tastiness. The Gobbler may be my reason for living. The staff are great, but they could be evil and I'd still give 5 stars because of their deliciousness. They have Voodoo chips which are an amazing combination of salt and vinegar and barbecue. The Clam Chowder is fit for Poseidon himself and according to my son the PB&J is more edible than Mom's -he even eats the crust. 
Clean, Good for families, great for anyone hungry. Yum."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is decisively delicious. Also, kind of expensive. Figure at least $10 for a sandwich with chips and drink. Comes with a pickle!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, and it stands up with the rest the of the double d's. Sandwich was well made, delicious, and I wanted another after I was done."}
{"text":"I love the dilly bird sandwich and cup of soup. I've tried the Wisconsin cheese, the potato and the lobster bisque they had on special. They were all very delicious. The soup comes in a bread bowl, which is a plus. I believe this is a great lunch alternative. They are quick, But the quality of the food does not suffer."}
{"text":"What the hell is a Dilly?  Dill is a pickle, and there's Piccadilly, both the circus and the old folks buffet.  Is Dilly a person?  Is Dilly some ante-bellum dance?   Whatever a dilly is, it's also a very high quality restaurant. 

Dilly's features exceptionally fine bread and Boar's head meats.   Admittedly, the sandwiches and wraps they offer really aren't my cup of tea, but the southwestern club I had was chock-full of quality ingredients and service was prompt and cheerful.   I also enjoyed the cream of broccoli soup in a breadbowl.   I've had better breadbowls and definitely had better soup, but everything seemed fresh and the place was packed so I'm tempted to think my pallete may just be unrefined.    

With wraps, sandwiches, 4 kinds of sides (namely ridiculously fresh and tasty fruit) and half sandwich/salad/soup options Dilly's is a great lunch tim get-away."}
{"text":"If you are having carb withdrawals -- this is the place to go!  lol  Even the salads come with a slab of french bread.  The sandwiches are to die for.  I've been visiting this particular location for over 15 years.  I think that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Usually  good sandwich, but not always. The hours are far too limited and the service is average."}
{"text":"If you are from metro NY looking for a good deli sandwich this is NOT your place."}
{"text":"We order from Dilly's Deli at least once a month for work. They are always pleasant, professional. The food  is AWESOME!!! Always fresh, we all here love them.
I wish they were up in the area I live at, northern Scottsdale. I would go there all the time with my husband. The staff is awesome and including management. If you never ate there before, please do they are awesome, They cook all of their breads. Good meats!! great pricing. The soups come with a homemade baked bread bowl.. gotta love them. Keep it up!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny grab and go version of the delicious locally owned Dilly's Delis around the valley.  Of course it is no where near the menu of the actual restaurants they have outside of the airport, but obviously that is because it is a Kiosk in an airport.  The wraps are delicious and better than most of the larger restaurants in the airport by far in my opinion.  If you are wanting the yummy soups in homemade bread bowls, you will have to drive the 2 miles to University and Hardy Dilly's Deli, but you can still get a great ready to go wrap or sandwich in 2 minutes and still make the flight that has started boarding!  I am thrilled to see little locally owned shops have made it into the sky harbor airport and hope that people will remember that they are in fact supporting local establishments and not the big chains found at most airports!"}
{"text":"Not sure what ppl like about this place. Food was bland and way below average. Very slow and just not my type of place. should of went to chilli's:("}
{"text":"Came in with daughter for lunch. Found the place clean and not very busy despite a weekday lunch hour. Ordered the humdinger sandwich. Plenty of flavor but not nearly enough pastrami to command such a high price. Daughter ordered clam chowder which was watery. Staff friendly."}
{"text":"Humdinger!  
What more is there to say.  It's the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased an overpriced salad and sandwich at Dilly's in the Phoenix airport on our way to Baltimore. As I was eating my salad on the flight, I discovered a very-dead moth in my salad. The bug was not wrapped in lettuce, but clearly on display. Needless to say I did not finish my salad and have reached out to the company to express my disgust. In the airport we are beholden to the vendors to provide clean food in a hurry. I will not ever visit this place again. I would suggest no one else do either."}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon after seeing Kinky Boots at Gammage.  Brought my elderly parents, son, and his girlfriend.  Dolores, the woman at the cash register, was extremely helpful and pleasant.  My father is somewhat disabled and confused and she made sure we had everything we needed.  We had a range of sandwiches from the veggie, to a club sandwich, tomato soup, and salads.  Everything was delicious and we would definitely go back. I just wish they had a restaurant in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Spock Wears Pants

Friday I needed to order food,
28 people what should I do? 
I'm going to go with a place I knew,
Mr. T used to say \"I pitty the foo\".

Dilly's Deli is just the thing,
The sandwhiches will make everyone sing,
Even if your arm is in a sling,
And it doesn't take bling-bling.

Faxed in an order at 10 O'clock,
28 sack lunches, none for Spock,
All their sandwhiches really rock,
Doesn't matter if you're a nerd or jock.

Southwestern club is what I ordered,
Didn't make a run for the boarder,
I'll bet your mom is a hoarder,
Yes I am a skateboarder.

All 28 sack lunches were correct,
Nothing suffered from neglect,
Buzz Aldren was a space cadet,
Do not worry and do not fret.

Food was delivered right on time,
They don't serve beer or wine,
The place is worth every dime,
My favorite band isn't Sublime. 

Alphalfa Sprouts

Thanks again Dilly's for accepting that huge order from me Friday."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm very satisfied with the quality and taste of my sandwich. I like that they use a panini press to give the bread a hot, crispy kick."}
{"text":"Oh YAY, a yummy sammy in AZ!  Went here last week and got the Gobbler sandwich on wheat with chipotle coleslaw.  YUMMMMM.

The bread was perfectly toasty in a not-ripping-the-roof-of-my-mouth kind of way, and the inside of the sandwich was tasty, with perfect portions of each piece.  The coleslaw was tasty, and had just the right amount of dressing on it.

I feel like I MUST go to Dilly's each time I go to AZ now...."}
{"text":"Looking to move to the area, took our realtors advice and went to Dillys. Had the Italian and a small bowl of tomato bisque. Great sandwich and great soup. A big plus was the bread bowl that comes with the soup. We will be back......"}
{"text":"The soup and sandwiches were simple, but executed extremely well and delicious. The bread bowls were extremely filling as well and the half combo looked like a full sized sandwich to me. It's a great dinner for when you are very hungry and want something easy, but still great."}
{"text":"We use to love this place but recently we've notice the sandwiches are not made the same. For instance I've always ordered the dilly bird which has turkey, avocado, cream cheese, sprouts, and mayo. Today I bit into my sandwich and got a mouth full of bread. So i looked in the middle and there was one puny slice of avocado, a few pieces of sprouts, a glob of mayo and very little meat. Same for my husband's sandwich. Definitely not worth the drive anymore."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I dream of it and would frequent it when I lived in AZ. The soup in a bread bowl and sandwiches are to die for. In my opinion this is the best deli in Arizona. I want to go there right now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. The place is directly west of the QT on the corner. Hoop in there and grab a dilly bird, and a cup of Wisconsin Cheese soup. Soup comes in a great bread bowl. The people working there are great to be around and they are always welcoming."}
{"text":"I love their Gobbler!! So yummy !! The sandwich makers are fast. They have delicious homemade soups, especially the broccoli cheddar soup!!"}
{"text":"They were fast, friendly, and Delicious! Which is my ideal place for a sand which shop. The Reuben I got was so good! I also liked that they offer fruit for only 50 cent more!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich!  I got the blazin' buffalo as recommended by a lunch guest and it was definitely worth a go!  Have not been here in a while and I'll have to make sore to visit again soon! Dilly Bird and Southwest Wrap were highly praised by my lunch mates, though the breads (great selections) are more favored over the wraps. Everyone has an opinion!"}
{"text":"My family and I live in Peoria and we always look forward to a night out at Gammage to see the latest show.  With our visits to Tempe, it's a tradition to stop at Dilly's for their delicious sandwiches and my kids love the soup bread bowls.  Last night was a biggie since we have been waiting a year to see Wicked.  Everything was perfect except we forgot to check the hours for Dilly's.  We got there at 6 pm and they were closed.  Delores saw us outside the restaurant trying to figure out what to do.  She came and got us, re-opened the restaurant, made us anything we ordered from the menu and was super nice to us as we stayed until almost 7 pm.  The food was great as always (the potato soup with Wisconsin cheese was the highlight....Delores's recommendation).  She made our night, which was highly anticipated for the last 12 months.  There's no question we'll be back at Dilly's Deli in a few weeks for Book of Mormons....look forward to seeing Delores again and hopefully not the woman shaking a box of Sno Caps behind us at Gammage like last night (there's always something).  Thanks Dilly's Deli from the Wolff Family."}
{"text":"The bread here is amazing! Everything is always fresh. Portions are good sizes too! I always get the dilly bird add jalapeños! SO GOOD. If you are looking for a place that is fast and close to campus. Do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I tried the classic dillys sandwich on sourdough and it has brough me back an additional 3 times..always friendly and super fresh food u wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always good. Haven't ever been disappointed. My favorite is their Dilly Bird sandwich which is turkey, sprouts, avocado, and mayo on choice of bread. 
 Their clam chowder is another must. Love it here."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a sandwich and wrap. You can't go wrong with either a sandwich one. .Hard to name a favorite item, since I've enjoyed them all.  

Items I enjoy most are the Humdinger (pastrami), Yahoo (roast beef) Dilly Club, Southwestern club and the Mexi, Caesar and Southwest Wraps

Sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and served with a pickle and one side-(chips, cookie)

I really enjoy the Poore Bros chips served here, especially the bbq ranch flavor. The cookies are also pretty good.

This location is less crowded then the Dilly's location closer to the ASU campus."}
{"text":"Now that I'm living in AZ full time, I need to hit Dilly's as often as I can. The sandwiches and wraps are still great! The Poore Bros chips are still fantastic. I'm a big fan of the BBQ Ranch flavor. I never stray from the goodness of these flavor of chips.

My favorites sandwiches are the humdinger, dilly club and then the mexi, southwest and chicken cesar wraps

You can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices on the menu. The cookies are very tasty!

All sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and come with your choice of a side and a pickle spear.

During the peak lunch hour, you wait in line a bit or struggle to find a table to sit.. Order usually come out within 5-10 minutes during peak time."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations. They use Boar's Head meat and the bread is crisp and fresh. The deli offers a plethora of sandwich combos. I recommend the Honey Do (turkey, tomato and cheddar cheese with alfalfa sprouts and honey mustard). I've never had anything I didn't like at Dilly's. Their salads are hearty. Be sure to try the Greek salad. They're cookies are delightful and I love the large, zesty pickles. They also serve delicious bread bowls, which are huge. My favorite is the Wisonsin Cheese. 

Dilly's is a no-frills lunch and dinner hangout. It's usually filled with college students and young professionals. I recommend getting there at 1 p.m. if you go for lunch because there's usually a line out the door after Noon."}
{"text":"I had the Humdinger with a cup of Wisconsin Cheddar, what a meal. The sandwich I had on rye bread and i haven't had the black rye bread for a very long time. The soup was delicious, I wish it was more than a cup, maybe I better order a bowl next time. There will definately be a next time for Dilly's."}
{"text":"Oh man its off the charts... Way satisfied with everything very good def bringin more ppl next time soo good its a must try bread bowl was awesome"}
{"text":"Went here with a recommendation and a coupon, so we figured what the hell. Reminded me of a cross between a small mom and pop Paradise and a Quizno's, but better. Their smokey mountain sandwich rocked! Bread was fresh, and good, and didn't leave a doughy after taste. Inside was clean, cashier was friendly and accommodating for our first visit. Enjoyed our visit on a late Sunday morning. I'd go back when in the area again."}
{"text":"The only minor complaint I have with this place is that it feels kinda like a subway inside. Other than that it's top notch. Very simple yet creative sandwich recipes and the prices aren't bad either. The Dilly Bird sandwich is awesome. It's Turkey, cream cheese, avocado and Mayo. Delicious. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I have loved dilly's deli for years and it doesn't  disappoint. We have had the occasional customer service issue but the food keeps us coming back for more. 

A half sandwich is enough for one person.... If I'm being greedy I also get soup in a bread bowl YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This whole thing dude. I've been going to dillys for years. The location on priest or whatever by Asu is much better. They effed everything up my wife is yelling at me as I'm writing this. I ordered take out and it was so effed. They used wheat bread instead of white, forgot the avocados, I noticed the avacados so had them put em on the side. I get home and they are dark brown and slightly green. I'm mostly pissed that I tipped them."}
{"text":"Warning, if you come here for lunch, you WILL wait. This is an amazing deli located between ASU, MCC, Banner Desert hospital and many other medical offices so it gets pretty busy but that should prove how good the food is.
 I highly recommend the Dilly Club but everything is great on their menu.
One great perk is that they deliver. I've been a regular here since 2004."}
{"text":"Top shelf customer service and yummy sammiches! Been coming here for many years and it's always good. Place is clean, the crew is diligent and helpful, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Ate here recently w/ my daughter and her boyfriend - they are repeat 'offenders', so I wanted to see for myself..  Fresh veggies and meat on fresh bread - how could you go wrong??? I got \"The Gobbler\" and it was delicious (turkey, lettuce, cream cheese, cranberry concoction on focacia...oh, me, oh, my!!) and the macaroni salad was pretty good, too.  Potato salad not bad (but I'm from the South, so no one ever gets that \"exactly\" right for me haha).  Sad they were out of Tomato Bisque the day I was there, but that's on my \"To Do\" list, w/ the grilled cheese, of course.  Nice atmosphere, quick service, delicious food, and good prices. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches... very well done and bread is very flavorful. We liked both veg and non-veg ones. 
We also bought some bread home."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here every week because we love the food.  They have been doing a lot of renovations that make the place look much better.  Downside:  They decided to jack up the prices and reduce the portions.  While the food is still good, it is now WAAAAYYY over priced.  I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one that feels that way.  Before the change, the line was out the door at lunch time.  Now, there is plenty of seating available and little wait.  The meat on our sandwiches was skimpy.  They took away the sides with the sandwiches and charge extra.  Portion sizes didn't fill up the container.  Cookies are smaller.  No pickles.  The only portion that didn't change was the bag of chips.  They must think customers don't notice these things.  I'll be taking my hard earned money and spending it elsewhere.  Pretty disappointed because we used to love this place."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is literally my favorite deli in the world. It's one of the places I always take people to show them the cool \"local\" places around ASU. The atmosphere is great, the food is always awesome and the service is almost always excellent. My favorite place to eat in Tempe, hands down."}
{"text":"Good food, inconsistent service. They are nice but don't really pay attention to special requests. I ordered a salad and didn't get the chicken I paid for. Another time I didn't get ranch when I asked for that instead of the Greek dressing. A little bit of effort would go a long way."}
{"text":"All an all a pretty good sandwich--the all American. It was my first time at Dilly's. The staff was courteous, the food was good, the wifi--a bit slow. I will definitely return, especially since they have happy hour prices after 2 for the summer."}
{"text":"Good food. We go here or order delivery a couple of times a month because it's so close to our house. Counter staff never seem to be particularly interested in being friendly but if you can get past someone staring at you as a \"greeting\", and they don't seem to have anyone assigned to wiping down the tables during the lunch rush, but otherwise, the food is worth with your time.

If you need some direction on what to try, give the Smokey Mountain a go. I find it to be better without onion; may just be my own preference. A cup of tomato bisque soup compliments it nicely.

Delivery seems to be hit and miss. Had some problems with delivery orders being \"forgot\", but they'd comp my meal and deliver it a few minutes later, and neither myself nor the roommate has had our order \"forgotten\" in a couple of months now. Perhaps they've rectified whatever was causing that?"}
{"text":"Same great menu as the location on University but a whole lot less crowded (except during lunch rush). The sandwiches are all huge, so either order the half, which is really more like a 3/4, or be prepared to share. The sandwiches are all toasted panini style, too, on their signature bread.

FYI - if you love avocado on your sandwich (I don't ... yuck!) they are far from generous with it. And, if you ask for extra be prepared to pay for it. My friend has tried to flirt, negotiate and argue her way into free/extra avocado. No dice!

I usually go for the soup in a bread bowl, especially the Wisconsin cheddar. It has carrots and celery and is flavored with bacon. It qualifies as a \"little piece of heavan\" IMHO. 

About the only down side is that you will smell like the inside of the deli for the rest of the day. It's not a particularly bad smell (something like toast, cheese and bacon) but  it can make you crave more Dilly's even when you're stuffed."}
{"text":"Dilly's is pratically perfect! They have a slew of sandwiches you can choose from and every single one I have tried has been outright delicious! I always come back to the chicken salad sandwich on white though. It is probably the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had and you know Ive had plenty in my day! Their bread is fresh and they toast it perfectly. They also have some of the best bread bowls this side of San Francisco! They have a few different soups and you can mix and match any of them, I usually go with the cheese soup mixed with the cream of broccoli. The bread bowl is so good that I cant help but devour the whole thing! Its pretty cheap too for what you get! A huge sandwich and large bread bowl is only like $8.50, which is, again, totally amazing for how much frickin' delicuous food you receive! Overall I give this place a \"Mmmm sandwich and soup, cant go wrong here!\""}
{"text":"Soup and Sandwich!! Amazing!! Quick service in and out!! Highly recommended!! I'll definitely be back to this location soon!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the Dilly Bird. First off, I'm not a fan of sandwiches: especially those that don't include salad somewhere in the name and have something you'd call lunch or deli meat inside. But the Dilly Bird is another thing altogether.  Usually I find turkey bland and dry, however theirs is flavorful and moist. It is sliced very thin and then stacked up in lots of layers. The wheat bread is fluffy, fresh and very delicious. Then it's got avocado whose inclusion has has never hurt any sandwich I've ever  had. And here is where it gets really good: it's also got sprouts and cream cheese. The sprouts give it some good bite and the cream cheese sweetens the whole thing into a YumYumYum moment. I highly recommend you all give the Dilly Bird a try, and while you are at it ask Dilly's to open a location that's near where I live. I really miss eating this sandwich but it's hard to justify driving 30 minutes/20 miles out of your way."}
{"text":"Good food that won't break your bank. The sandwhiches are all stellar and the bread bowl soups are hearty and delicious. I stopped in once because of a coupon and I got hooked. My wife and I are in here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Has a bacon avocado turkey sandwich and creamy chicken soup bread bowl . All around very good and man the food was served fast!"}
{"text":"Short Review:

I frequented this place. Ate here once a week and I had moved a couple of years ago. Came back to visit and noticed that management has changed along with the look and feel of the restaurant.

Ordered my favorite sandwich, Smokey Mountain, and it was mediocre at best. This place now seems to have succumbed to the corporate threshold of Coca Cola, which they seem to advertise everywhere.

So sad, so sad."}
{"text":"Its definitely better than making my own sandwich...good soups that come in a bread bowl. Let's not get past the fact that its nothing fancy....average atmosphere with average service...I would recommend to anyone for a good sandwich and soup."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken was very tender and definitely a large size portion. 

However, the service was not great. The cashier who rung me up was extremely unfriendly and when I asked a question about the menu, he just stared at me instead of clearing up my confusion. After all of that, I was overcharged for my lunch and left feeling extremely frustrated for not even getting the combo meal that I paid for.

Food A.....Service F."}
{"text":"Super great deli with tasty sandwiches and soups. The Blazing Buffalo is my favorite."}
{"text":"The food and service was ok. For me, it was not worth the cost. I write this review after two visits"}
{"text":"Stopped into Dilly's today after a long, tiring day at the hospital. Ordered on my way home and my dinner was ready for pickup in less than ten minutes. My bread bowl with clam chowder was delicious! My sandwich, the Dilly Bird, was just \"ok\". Nothing special. But the service was great and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is a frequent stop for us when we're close to ASU. The Dilly Club is a great sandwich especially when you add avocado. You can choose from a bunch of different breads and they also have wraps and salads. The soups set Dilly's apart from other sandwich shops. I prefer the Wisconsin Cheese while the wife loves her Cream of Broccoli. Friendly staff and it's very clean."}
{"text":"I heard that they don't use Boars Head meat anymore. I tried their Dilly Bird sandwich and it was okay and so was the soup. The guy recommended a mix of the cream of potato and Wisconsin cheese. It was excellent! The soup come with a bread bowl that is delicious! They bake their bread fresh in the morning. I didn't use it as a bowl, but ate it on the side. It was so good that I had to wrap it up to nibble on later. I pride myself as a pretty good bread maker and I think this bread is pretty good.
In summary, I highly recommend you stop in and try a large cream of potato and Wisconsin  cheese mix. Soup is a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location since my younger college-age days, but everything was great. I like the menu they have up (easier to read than the Chandler location) and the tables were all cleaned off about 2 seconds after people left them. 

Only 4 stars because my sandwich was kind of lacking in turkey - I got the Honey Do and while it tasted really good, the ratio of bread to meat was too heavy on the bread."}
{"text":"A delightful sandwich shop. Breads and bread bowls are made in house. All soups are served with a bread bowl. Their potato soup is, how you say...da-bomb! Side salads are good too. They have a wide selection of sides you can choose to accompany your sandwich. You also get a nice crunchy pickle with a hint of garlic, very tasty! I like all of their sandwiches! When I ate meat, my fav was the Southwestern Club: pepper turkey, bacon, pepper jack, avocado, red onion, and their delicious raspberry honey mustard. Their wraps are good too! Now I get the veggie supreme: cream cheese, swiss cheese, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, lettuce, mushrooms, and instead of ranch I usually get one of the honey mustards. Beware! If you eat inside you will smell heavily of bread! No joke, no way around it. No matter who you are, you are not safe from the bread smell. You will smell bad when you leave. Can't smell it? We can! Haha and it smells like bread BO. Best advice, order quickly, sit outside, and drive back home or to work with your car windows down. We at the office know to do this as well as turn our desk fans on and spray extra perfume. Haha. You don't smell good. You smell gross. The food is great though!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, reasonable prices, prompt service.  The bread is amazing."}
{"text":"I have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!"}
{"text":"I love sammy shops, especially sub shops. I have been to nearly all of the sub shops in the East Valley, and only yesterday had my first experience at Dilly's Deli. I'm sure Dilly's is a 5 star shop, but I will have to go several more times to be sure of the 5 star rating. The bread! One more time for clarification, the bread!!! I have never experienced a sammy shop anywhere with bread of this quality. I had the sour dough, as did my grandson. The bread was so good, I was several bites into my sammy before I even thought about the meat. I had the Italian with double meat. The double meat was not necessary as the regular pilling on of meat was more than ample. Other sammy shops that I often frequent will all be placed as a second tier sammy shop for a new primary has taken over."}
{"text":"Terrific sandwiches, a great place to stop by on the way home or to work.  Definitely my favorite deli in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I always get the soup in a bread bowl and 1/2 a sandwich.  AMAZING!!  It's not your ordinary sandwich shop that's for sure."}
{"text":"I've passed by Dilly's a hundred times in the two years I lived in Tempe and never stopped in. I passed by it again today while in Tempe, and in the perfect storm, decided to stop in and grab some lunch to go. I ordered the Yahoo on Foccacia (Hot sandwich with roast beef, mushrooms and cheese), potato salad and had a raspberry iced tea. All I can really say is holy sh*t. Turns out there was rosemary in the sandwich and it was the perfect addition. Seriously, get this sandwich. Delicious. The potato salad was a little sweet but it was good. The pickle had incredible flavor. Really good sandwich."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The bread is a bit greasy for me though. Extra points for using Boards Head meat and having so many different mustards and sauces. 

The soup in the bread bowl is the highlight of the day. I like the chicken noodle. It's so bad for you but worth it every once in a while.

I also feel 90 years old when I eat at this location. I'm not even 30 but the college kiddies look at me like, bitch please."}
{"text":"I would have never noticed this place if it weren't for yelp. Awesome awesome place to find grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was really really good and the price was amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"wow.....okay wow, this place is just great. Can I first comment on their portion size, HUGE! I had a half portion and that filled me up. It was my first time so I just got the B.L.T and it was so good, I'm thinking about it the next day! My husband had a side of potato salad (he's usually really critical of potato salad since he insists his moms is the best) and I swear he almost cried it was so good. My son had the kids ham and cheese and finished it! That's saying a lot for a very picky five year old. And to finish it off, I shared a sugar cookie with white frosting and sprinkles with my son and no lie it might have been the best cookie I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. My friends and I order from here at least 3 times a month. The Dilly Bird, Yahoo and the Reuben are absolutely delicious. It's a bit pricey but soooooo worth it. I simply love Dilly Deli :)"}
{"text":"I used to go to this Dilly's Deli every week when I used to live in the area, never had a customer service issue, and enjoyed the sandwiches and soups, but my last visit there wasn't so pleasant. 

I went on a slow afternoon during a weekday a few weeks ago and there were two employees working at the time, I was the only customer in the deli. I approached the menu board to decide what items to order for my family, and the female employee behind the register immediately asked me what I'd like to order. I told her I didn't know yet, and her demeanor quickly changed, and she let out an exasperated breath. I passed it off, but when I was ready to order I asked her a simple question about the combo, and she got annoyed and was rushing me to finish my order. I was so irritated that I didn't even order my meal. I paid for the items I did order and not once did she smile or say thank you. I felt like I had ruined her down-time at work since no other customer was in the deli except me. Whatever her deal was, her attitude towards me was uncalled for and I will never go back.

As I got my items to-go, I asked her for her name, it was Lexie. She was a young brunette with a major chip on her shoulder. If you go into this deli I hope you get better service."}
{"text":"Had the Humdinger and I was very disappointed. If I pay $ 7 for a sandwich it better taste better than what I could do at home. The Rye bread was forgettable, and there wasn't enough meat. If this sandwich was $ 3 cheaper it would've been appropriately priced. If I go back maybe I'll try a bread bowl people seem to like those..."}
{"text":"I went here with my dad yesterday just looking for an average sandwich. We got much more than just your average and sandwich.

I ordered the italian on focacia with a side of pasta salad and my dad ordered the dilly club on white. 

Both sandwiches were amazing. Fresh meat, fresh veggies and delicious bread. I can't get over how good the focacia was. I might have to get every single sandwich I order from there on focacia!

The pasta salad was also delicious. Would get again. 

All in all, for 7 dollars you get an enormous sandwich that is also delicious."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli: Slices of Happiness. A simple sandwich will always lead the sandwich consumer down the road to happy town. Meat and cheese layered on top of warm bread is the key to a smile, and Dilly's is the key master. I picked up the Smokey Mountain, brought it home, and  I was transported back to happy town. Stop at this Deli, and find your road...."}
{"text":"Had dental work yesterday, so in restricted to soft food. Hmm, where can I get a decent - or even just passable - bowl of soup? I know! Dilly's Deli. Gosh, but the last time I went there at lunch time (maybe a year ago) it took forEVER to get my order. Well I'll be - they have online ordering. Score!
Order large cream of broccoli soup in a bread bowl. Handy checkbox for \"in\" the bowl or \"on the side\". I want that bread pre-gooey and soupy, so \"in\". 
2 minutes later got an email that my order is ready. Sweet!
Less than 5 minutes later I'm already back in my car & headed back to work with my expectedly delish grub. 
Open the bag to see an un-cut bread boule loose in the bag & a styrofoam cup of soup. Guess I'll have to just rip up the bread & dip it in the soup. 
Then I open the styrofoam container to find that the soup is effin' cold. What the [expletive]?!
Why the h-e-double-hockeystick would I pay a restaurant for soup & not have it heated?
If I put it in the microwave at work, styrofoam melts!
So I ended up eating nasty as eff, cold cream of broccoli, dipping dry bread in it. 
Definitely not the lunch I was wanting. At all. 
In fact, I can feel it working its way back up on me now. 
Awesome. Dental work yesterday. Hurling crappy cream of broccoli soup today. 
Eff you, Dilly's. I'm never coming back again for lunch. 
Or at least until the next time I forget how much of an unbelievable let down this was."}
{"text":"I was a HUGE DD's fan all through college.. frequenting their ASU location at least 2x a week and always ordering the saaaame damn thing (the Dilly's Dilly).  Lately, since I cook at home more, I am not a frequent customer.. however, on those occasions where I'm craving a Dilly's Dilly (not on the menu, but still order-able: turkey, sprouts, bacon, avocado, minus the catalina sauce), I like to get my fill at this location.

So today I decided to venture out of my comfot zone.... yes, after YEARS of ordering the same exact sandwich I decided to try one called the Babaloo (ham, pulled pork, cheese, pickles and spicy mustard)... damn it!  I should have stuck to what I know! I found this sandwich to be boring in flavor and so blah, I barely noticed there was anything besides the blah sourdough... sooo disappointing!

This is the ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 - because this was a huge disappointment to me after many years of consistently great Dilly's Dilly, they had to kill my adventurous spirit...  I guess I know now to stick to my usual and not to venture out.. that's not really a good opinion to have of a sandwich joint, but sadly it's the one I have right now of DDs. 

Besides that, the service and staff is always fast, seating is easy, and their salads are colorful and fresh-tasting."}
{"text":"Monthly special \"smokehouse\" sandwich- roast beef, turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, Russian mustard on wheat bread. Very good! The Russian mustard was a little sweet and it was a very nice flavor. Also got a side of chipotle coleslaw, it was OK, but seemed more peppery than anything. The flavor could have been better, more \"chipotle.\" It was very busy so be prepared to wait during lunch time! I didn't have any problem with it, I just waited and drank iced tea. The girl at the counter was very friendly, will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"***Update*** Business owner contacted me and apologized for his employee. It's not his fault that sometimes employees can be rotten. So I'm updating my review from 1 star to 4 because I really appreciate the customer service and respect from the owner. The deli was cute and after the mayo was put on my sandwich at home it was pretty good. Oh, and the prices are very reasonable. 

If there was a zero star I would put it. I brought my chihuahua in to the restaurant because I usually take her everywhere. I'm actually working on her certification to be a worker dog for kids, I bring her to schools, etc. but she didn't have her best and gear. Anyways, the guy flipped out on me! That dog can't be in here!! The health inspector would shut us down!! And he tells me this in the rudest way! If he would have just said you can't have your dog in here. I would have been like I'm sorry I'll go, and they would have returning customers. Not to mention my 7 year old daughter was with me, and the whole situation made her really upset. Now they lost a lot of customers, my friend found out about the place from his work , so now I will make sure to stop this grapevine. And by the way you can have worker dogs in there, so don't act like one dog will get the place shut down. And even if it is against the rules you don't have to be a tyrant.   And on top of it they screwed up my order...... I ordered mayo on my sandwich and I got some dried up sandwich with no mayo. And I couldn't even get some I got chased out so quick..... Horrible experience....."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Dilly's Deli since the very first time I ever ate here. If I'm in the mood for a sandwich, I'm in the mood for a Dilly's sandwich.

I recently moved from Tempe to North Scottsdale and one of my first thoughts was, \"I guess I'll just be driving further to get my sandwiches now.\" No joke. Fortunately, there's a Dilly's in Scottsdale, too! Woohoo!

Everything about the Dilly's experience is just wonderful. But, naturally, the best part is their food. The sandwich options are varied and consistently delicious. The prices are fair, too, especially considering the sheer size of the portions!

Their bread is made fresh in-house, and they have a TON of mouth-watering options, too! They're one of the few places I've been too that keeps sprouts on-hand for health nuts like me, too, which is a fun little plus! I always order sprouts on my sandwich when I eat here.

In all the times that I've been to Dilly's, they've only gotten my order wrong once. Under normal circumstances, this might cost them a star; but I like Dilly's so much that I simply can't bring myself to detract a star. They deserve all five.

Dilly's will continue to be one of my all-time favorite go-tos for a filling and nutritious meal. If you haven't ever been, you're missing out. Seriously. GO!

Thank you, Dilly's Deli, for being AWESOME! I'll keep visiting. And I'll keep sending all my friends your way, too.  ;)"}
{"text":"On the plus side, 3 stars is about the highest rating a place that serves packaged meat can receive...I know it's a chain, so I can't expect much more than that, but with such a large location and great sandwich ideas, preparing their meat in house would make a huge difference.

I've usually only go to their Broadway location and I must say that they do a slightly better job over there...It's possible that the times I've been in were just \"off-days\", but after having such good experiences over there, I'm always slightly disappointed when I give this one a shot. (which sucks because it's so close to my work/home)

Of course, the sandwich selection is the same and very good...Enough great ideas to be able to go in frequently and not have to order the same thing. But this location just doesn't seem as...fresh. The pickles are often limp, the bread doesn't seem as if it were just baked (nor does it have that \"fresh baked bread\" smell) and I feel like the sides are prepared well in advance of when they are served. Perhaps they are prepared at a different location and delivered to Chandler?? I'm not sure, but the difference between different locations is apparent.  

I'm not saying it's all bad...The ingredients, even when not great, are still good enough to keep me coming in. The soups/bread bowls are good and the staff is always very nice. I've never had a bad experience, I've just never had a GREAT experience. I will say, though, that you're not going to find a better deli in the area. If I'm looking for a decent sandwich at a reasonable price without having to drive too far, this is my spot..."}
{"text":"Alright, I have a bad habit of coming somewhere and getting the same thing over and over. I never will work through the Dilly menu for the simple fact that I am addicted to the BBQ Chicken, Blazing Buffalo, and if I am feeling quirky the Dilly Bird.

Oh, and I cannot forget about the Wisconsin Cheese Bowl. I nearly inhale the stuff. Today I actually got so excited that I took too big of a bite out of my bread bowl and cheese was spilling all over the place. Clearly... a \"food foul\" and I was strongly considering licking it off the table. (Yes, it is that good)! I have also heard good reviews of the Boston Clam Chowder.

I can't say much except that I've thoroughly enjoyed every trip I've made to this place. 

What is the downfall of the place? For me, that they close at 8pm. And because they are locally owned, they are closed down at random sometimes."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I think what separates this place from other similar places is the quality of the bread.  This day I got the club minus the tomato.  It was good as always.  I had a small pasta salad also.  It was pretty good too.  This place is one of my favourite lunch places."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. Had the southwest wrap in a spinach wrap. Great sandwich, filling, and a great price! I will be back. Dilly dilly"}
{"text":"As far as sandwich places go, this place definitely knows what they are doing! Dilly Bird is so delicious! The turkey is fresh, the focaccia bread is bomb and I love a sandwich that has sprouts (it's an underrated veggie.)

Recommendation: 
- Dilly Bird *I normally minus the cream cheese and add cucumber on my sandwich.* 
- Gobbler *minus the cream cheese on this one too....i just don't care for it on my sandwiches.*
- Potato salad (yum!)

Service is fast & friendly and they do have delivery if you are in there \"delivery zone.\"

FYI: Their sandwich portions are large so if you are not starving try their classic combo which is a 1/2 classic sandwich with soup or salad."}
{"text":"Good fresh sandwiches and the Wisconsin Soup is awesome. Great little deli and it is very close to the ASU campus."}
{"text":"Easily Dilly's Deli is my sandwich shop of choice in Tempe.  I think I must luck out when it comes to the weekday ASU/Downtown Tempe crowds, because I never have had much of a wait here.  

The sandwiches here are superior: Boar's Head meats and thick luscious sliced bread made from scratch.  I never go wrong with the dark brown cracked wheat.  My usual order here is the Southwestern club (turkey, bacon, avocado, pepper jack cheese, red onions and raspberry honey mustard), although the Smokey Mountain and Buffalo Chicken are tasty as well.  The Southwestern club is comparable to the Turkey Chipotle wrap from Paradise Bakery if you're into that.

Now that it's cooling down, I'll be up for the bread bowl soup thang so I'll def. update you all on the soup.

Dilly's is more pricey than your typical sandwich place, but worth it I think.  Lunch with a soda ran me 9 bucks."}
{"text":"They use Boars Head meat so that's a great start. Then they offer some very tasty soups and special soups all week that also keep a variety available. It's locally owned which is great for the community. And the chocolate chip cookies are sublime. Overall, this is a great local stop near ASU."}
{"text":"Dilly's in one of the many places I was stoked to go to after moving back to the Valley. When I saw that on Saturday and Sunday kids eat free, I knew we had to go.

I remember when this location opened and it is exactly.the.same. I used to come over here to get lunch on my lunch break from Tower Records. It was like stepping into a time machine and my go-to sandwich (the Gobbler) was EXACTLY the same. I'm pretty bummed that I didn't get the Wisconsin Cheese soup. Next time.

The guy working the register wasn't all that friendly. Fairly curt, actually. The seating area was a mess, looks like the tables hadn't been cleaned in awhile. It was getting dark outside and just as equally dark inside. Maybe there were some lights that needed to be replaced? 

The experience was just ok...I started by giving the place 3 stars but added another because my food was pretty good. Exactly what I had wanted and my husband was happy with his as well (Humdinger). The kids grilled cheese was pretty gross, but to be fair, I took a bite when it was cold."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but a little on the pricey side.  However, they do carry Zapp's chips, which I am a big fan of.  I will definitely try the soup next time.  I saw someone enjoying their soup, and it sure looked delicious.  Also, their mac salad and potato salad seem to be fresh made and are very good."}
{"text":"I don't think Dilly's is technically a deli . . . whatever, doesn't matter.  Along with the Cheba Hut, it's a go to place for . . . well, it just seems wrong to call them simply sandwiches

Great giant sandwiches with thickass slices of bread (I don't think I've ever finished a whole one in one sitting), tons of variety, and they've never once been pricks when asked for a special order.  \"Can I get that without tomatoes and mayo, but with cucumbers and spicy mustard instead?\"  The \"not pricks\" factor is always appreciated.  They're an especially great value if you get the basket . . . a whole sandwich with a pickle spear and a side for $7.  I especially like the mac and pasta salads.  

The bread bowl of soup is a tad overpriced for what little soup it comes with if you eat in . . . seems like you get more soup if you get it take out.  Strange.

Here's a little take-out tip . . . place your order at Dilly's, then walk across the street to Top's and pick up some brews.  By the time you get back, your order will be ready!"}
{"text":"I didn't get to try their food but ordered from grubhub.  They immediately notified me that because of my mushroom allergy I should not order due to cross contamination.  Cudo's to them for doing what's right.  It could have sent me to the ER!  Thank you Dilly's!"}
{"text":"Dilly's is a classic Arizona deli.  If you haven't been before, put it on your list.  From the Gobbler, to the Dilly Bird, to the Yahoo, you can't go wrong.  The service is also friendly and quick, perfect for a take-out order or dine-in."}
{"text":"Its small and it can get really busy so try to go on the fringes of the lunch hour if you want to get a seat or avoid a wait.  The sandwiches are huge but I wish that my chicken Caesar wrap had more dressing in it....it was kind of dry without it.  (I actually ended up just taking it out of the wrap and eating it like a salad.)  I've heard they have pretty good clam chowder so I'm going to have to check that out if we ever get a day that is cool enough to warrant warm, creamy chowder."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop, hands down.  Their half soup (in a bread bowl I might add) and half sandwich combos make the perfect lunch.  I've been diggin the Southwestern Club with Potato soup lately, although you can't go wrong with the Dilly Bird, Blazin Buffalo Chicken, or hot Roast Beef.  There's another place called Bison Wiches that serves similar sandwiches, but I'm staying loyal to Dilly's!  I've been eating there since my ASU days..."}
{"text":"One of three great Dilly's locations locally. I love the ability to get either a big, fat, honkin', juicy pastrami sammich, or something light and healthy. Both taste great, and it means Dilly's is a great spot for a group with a wide range of lunch tastes."}
{"text":"I have been eating and ordering from this location since 2003. My food is always excellently prepared. The staff is friendly and helpful. The delivery shows up earlier than stated and that's fine by me. Try the Doozy that's my favorite. The cream of broccoli soup with a bread bowl will put you in a food coma."}
{"text":"My coworker told me this place was out of this world so I thought I would have it delivered. I called it in and they told me it would be ready within the hour. An hour and a half later my coworker who had ordered something as well called to see what the status was and they hadn't even left yet. Luckily the woman who answered offered to comp the meals and shortly after that someone arrived and apologized at my office. When I opened my lunch my soup was amazing but wasn't even hot and the bread bowl was good but cold. I think I'll just stick with paradise bakery next time."}
{"text":"Ugh I LOVE this place!

I'm so sad the scottsdale location closed. I live in north Phoenix and drove with my best friend to this Tempe location cause we missed it so much. 

We haven't been here in years and I hopped it didn't change, and it sure didn't! The service is good and the food is incredible. Best sandwich shop around. 

Amanda got her buffalo chicken sandwich and wow is it good. The bread is all so fresh and crispy. I wish I could only eat this bread rest of my life. I got the Rueben which was bomb as well. I usually get either the Rueben or Italian. Next time I'll get the classic Italian. 

The sides are amazing. I could eat tubs of their macaroni or potato salad. 

I cannot say how much we love this place. We literally were so excited to go here again. My friend was in area for a wedding so we made sure we went to dilly's. 

Thanks for staying the same and being amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is very good! I had the clam chowder and the BLT. Closest thing to the San Francisco Warf Clam Chowder you'll find based on the bread bowl alone. The BLT was crispy and fresh too."}
{"text":"The food was so so. Very little meat on the sandwich. I was a little disgusted that the girl taking my order was standing there picking her face, especially when she handed me the food without washing her hands. The other staff members were all in the back eating and not once did I see anyone wash their hands. 
My wife enjoyed her chicken salad sandwich and there is a good choice of bread."}
{"text":"1st comment: Booo for the road crew who is blocking off one of the main entrances to this great place. I feel bad that Dilly's is in pretty much a ghost town of a strip mall, and to have a bunch of pipe laying across the entry to it is really a shame and has to be hurting this small business. 

I make it a point to eat at Dilly's just really whenever humanly possible. The food is great, the staff is laid back, it is locally owned and has been around since I was in high school, so many good memories in this place.

I go for the veggie supreme and add bacon. No I'm obviously not a vegetarian, but how many sandwich joints give you much more than the standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle routine? Dilly's veggie does cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, mushroom, cucumber, sprouts, and ranch. Topped with bacon, it is money.

Soups are great. My one beef is that I wish that they would have some broth based options for soups. 

They give a shoutout to local AZ company Poore Brothers as the supplier for their chips, so you know they are a local business who is practicing what they preach. I for one love that."}
{"text":"Dear Club Sandwich with a side of clam chowder in a bread bowl,

It's been 5 years since I've left you for chicken katsu plate lunches and shaved ice. Since then, I've been living in a place some people call Hawaii.  From time to time I'd randomly come across a socially awkward looking sandwich at subway, or adventurous and energetic clams in a restaurant and it never fails to stir up some old emotions we once shared with each other.  After you, everything came in second place.  You were the best I've ever had.  I sometimes wish I never left you, but you and I know it was for the best.  You were getting the best of me...and I have the love handles to prove it.  I hope one day our paths cross again where I can once again hold you, hug you, eat you, love you.  But until then, I'll keep searching for your replacement.  

Your #1 dude in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,
Justin"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I love the big sandwhiches and the soups are so delicious."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty sandwiches, a little pricey, but oh so yummy. I had the Yahoo (Roast Beef), and they used the perfect, tender meat to pair with gooey swiss cheese, mushrooms and onions. This is a perfect sandwich that hits the spot when you want a hot sandwich! Place is clean and staff is pretty friendly. Drop by or else you're missing out on a lot."}
{"text":"Cheese soup in a bread bowl FTW!
I've been a loyal Dilly's fan for years!  
I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and I can't say I've had a bad item.

The Dilly Bird is my all time fave.  On white or sourdough is best.  

The portions are large, and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was craving a good sandwich for lunch so I went to Dilly's because I've heard so many great things about it. I ordered one of their \"signature sandwiches\" the Smokey Mountain, on whole wheat bread. The sandwich came out quickly and I soon discovered why. It looked like it was sloppily thrown together with no time or care put into it. The bread was warm but the cheese and bacon were both cold. The bread and russian mustard overtook the whole sandwich, the taste was very poor. The best word I can use to describe this sandwich is SLOPPY. I was extremely disappointed with my experience. Only positive note is that the man running the cash register was polite and professional."}
{"text":"Service is always great!
The Dilly Bird and Wisconsin Cheese Soup are my regular favorites.
I've never had anything there that wasn't good.  
My kids even like it.
Portions are large."}
{"text":"I should not have went back for more soup like I wrote two years ago. Luckily, the prices haven't risen and I only wasted four bucks on one of the nastiest bowls of soup in the history of the soup. They have fatty, dark chunks of pre-cut chicken floating around in a tasteless creamy kind of liquid. This is not made in-house obviously and based on my last visit, I thought it might have been. This place is a college dump, avoid unless you like eating bread bowls for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and the sandwiches are not that great. I paid extra for avocado and seriously got one sliver on each side of my sandwich, total rip off. Don't waste your time subways better than this place."}
{"text":"OMG four and a half stars?

Apparently if you want a four and a half star performance from a sandwich, you can go to dilly's deli.  Alternatively, you can:

Go to the store.  Buy a loaf of bread.  Make your sandwich with four slices of bread, instead of two.  Put mediocre meat on it.  Serve it with a side of potato salad that has too much dill in it and will stay on your breath for a month.

Don't drink the water here because it tastes like sewage.  I could be in the minority here but the witches were in the minority during the salem witch trials and upon further review, who was right?  I rest my case."}
{"text":"if you live in tempe, this has to be a staple to your menu. good, fat sandwiches on thick slices of toasted bread.
always have new england chowder - and you get the bread bowl even if you get it to go, very nice.
i had the greek salad and thought it was kind of bad. but other than that, this place is killer.
usually super packed during lunch time because of proximity to ASU, and parking can be a pain during those time."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Dilly's Deli - at the suggestion of a friend.  I can't say that the name would have drawn me in.

My wife's wrap was good and a good portion.  My half a sandwich, however, was long on bread and short on meat.  The flavor was excellent, but there just wasn't much there.

We may give Dilly's another chance.  Like I said, the quality was good and tasty, the proportion of bread to meat was just a little smaller than expected."}
{"text":"Dilly's is staple of Tempe. From their focaccia to sourdough, their quality selection of bread is unparalleled. They also have some of the best combinations that they recommend for their sandwiches and the best bread bowls you will find in the area. Highly recommend for anything from a light lunch to a heartier meal!"}
{"text":"You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.  Their line-up is chock-full of sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, etc.  They also have a ton of halfer options (ie. half sandwich half soup, half salad half soup, etc. - I'm a total sucker for halfies!) Quicktip though, avoid hitting this place at lunch during the weekdays, it's an absolute madhouse."}
{"text":"Quality sandwiches and great soups at a reasonable price.  Their bread is excellent as are their soups.  Sometimes the sandwich making could be a bit better put together instead of sloppily thrown on bread.  Usually their service is good but occasionally it can be a touch slow while ordering.  Their menu and their combo options might be confusing to some, especially if you are new.  We visit somewhat regularly, mainly on weekends when kids eat free.  It is a local place with four locations in the valley.  My family enjoys it enough that we will continue going here and we recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE these sandwiches and I am sad to leave this review. Especially because we just moved close to a dilly. I am NOT joking, I bit in my sandwich to find a battery in there. I have a toddler and luckily it was not her sandwich - she could have swallowed it. It was take out so I drove back to the location,made the manager look at the sandwich.she admitted the battery belonged to one of her devices and issued a refund. But my trust as a customer in their kitchen is 0 now and I have not returned. The manager apologized but had a what ever attitude and I'm Truly disappointed"}
{"text":"One of the only food places in AZ I miss! This place is just awesome, you order a half sandwich and the soup in a bread bowl and you've got yourself a food coma. The Wisconsin Cheddar soup is to die for. The dinning room isn't much more than some chairs and a few tables, but this place isn't about the dining, it's about the food. If they ever expand to the East Coast, I'll be the first person in line."}
{"text":"Great wraps and sandwiches. Some very good vegetarian options too. My favorites are the Veggie Supreme and the Greek Wrap. Check to ASU Student handbooks for coupons!

Be aware that they don't stay open too late though."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was a regular stop for me and my friends during high school. We loved this place, but then a few years ago (5 or so) it took a serious nose dive. The portions lessened and the quality became really sloppy and staff seemed not to care. Eventually I just stopped going altogether. 

Then, last week I decided to give it another try. I have to say, they are back! Portions were large, the Southwest Club was as good as it use to be (recommend that you request that they go light on the raspberry mayo) and the soups are awesome. So happy that this place got back to it's roots; the very reason they were able to become a chain in the first place.

{"text":"This place is BOMB. I had the best sandwich ever. I got the dilly bird which has cream cheese, sprouts, turkey, and mayo (I did without). I added tomato to my sandwich. I loved the toasted grilled bread for my sandwich, it wasn't too crunchy and it gave the sandwich a good flavor. I definitely will be coming back. I want to try the sandwich with the cranberry sauce next, can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Apparently \"grilled\" cheese means microwaved here. Last visit here unfortunately. this place used to be great"}
{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches & salads. I really like the thick hearty bread, but it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world (especially when it's thoroughly buttered). I really like the Sedona Salad - fresh spinach (really fresh), cranberries, deliciously spiced nuts, and tons of feta cheese. Again, I'm not sure how healthy this salad is with all the cheese and buttered bread, but it is a damn fine filling lunch."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli became part of my vocab when I was a sophomore at ASU, I was with my fellow SAA crew and one of the girls had me take a bite of her Mexi-wrap, and after that first mmmmmmm everything else is history. There are 4 sandwich items that I commonly order of the Dilly board and that is: Dilly Bird, the Dilly Club, the Southwestern Club and the Gobbler all can be paired with the YUMMIEST chicken noodle soup in a bread boule. I love the toasted bread, the hefty sandwiches, the meat used, and the overall taste. There are times I crave Dilly's and during those rare cold overcast days we get during winter in the valley, I head over at times to my closest Dilly's (in S. Chandler) or drive to the Dilly's by campus on University Dr. and have a chicken noodle soup *yum*... we Sun Devils are just plain lucky!"}
{"text":"Ok. My boyfriend has been trying to get me to come here for months. However, I am not a sandwich lover, so I've always refused to come with him for lunch. Once we actually pulled up here (I didn't know that this was where we were going) and parked and I made him leave. I'm usually not this difficult about food, but I like hot food and always think of sandwiches as cold. We went to Samurai Sam's instead that day and now I know what a huge mistake I made. 

I tried Dilly's Deli for the first time yesterday and I loved it! I got half a Yahoo sandwich (roast beef, melted Swiss, mushrooms, and onions) and a creamy chicken noodle soup which comes with a bread bowl. Both were delish and cost only $6.29. I'm craving both again as I write this. I will have to try another one of their soups when I come back. This location does get pretty busy. We stopped by for a late lunch and just beat the crowds that came in about 5 minutes after us."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Dilly Bird, it's just a delicious sandwich... I can't speak for all locations but the one in Mesa off of Southern was a real disappointment the other night.  I waited almost 30 minutes for a cold turkey sandwich!  After working all day and sitting in traffic for an hour the last thing I want to do is sit in a fast food joint for that long, especially when all the \"kids\" behind the counter are messing around talking about their homework and girlfriends or boyfriends and not working.  I have been going to this location for a dilly bird for longer than I can remember, but unfortunately I will not be returning any time soon unless someone can guarantee I wont have to sit and listen to teenagers for a half hour while I wait for a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"Great claim chowder served in a bread bowl, homemade bread, always fresh ingredients, always delicious, always great service! I always have some type of reward because I go so often! The shop is always clean and neat. Really good sweets as well! For me, this is the BEST sandwich spot in the valley!!
This place is best described as ALWAYS!!"}
{"text":"Located across from Oreganos, this little made-to-order sandwich place was packed when I came in for an early lunch.  Dilly's reminded me of a very pared down Panera (for those east coast folk) with its sandwich/soup/salad combos.  I chose the turkey sandwich (\"Gobbler\") and decided against the soup (the weather was too hot).  My sandwich was really good!  Toasted bread, lots of turkey with cranberries and lettuce and tomatoes....hit the spot.  My sugar cookie was also good; light and crispy topped with a sweet pink icing.  (In addition to sugar cookies, Dilly's offered chocolate chip cookies and brownies).

The menu is small but I think that works in Dilly's favor, especially when the queue is long.  Soups come in bread bowls (eat-in option).  Seating is ample during non-rush times.  Prices are reasonable and the people are nice.  Don't dilly dally on your way to this deli!  ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered our food at 10:30, delivered at 12:30 one sandwich short and the wrong chips. Today was my first and last time ever ordering from Dilly's Deli. I suggest if that you are hungry, in a time limit and expect the correct order you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and soups! I haven't tried one thing that I didn't like yet! The Ruben and buffalo chicken are my a time favorite and their tomato bisque is to die for!! They should open more locations like asap!!"}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is a great lunch time spot.  My coworker suggested going because it is her favorite soup place, she loves the potato. I usually call ahead because it gets crowded.  They have the best soups, very creamy with lots of flavor.  I'm not big on chunky soups, so I like the crab and lobster bisque (only served on Fridays) and the Wisconsin cheese.  The chicken noodle is good too, lots of noodles in a creamy broth.  I like the sandwiches too, the Southwest (comes with sweet honey mustard) and chicken salad (has lots of dill) are my favorites.  The more traditional sandwich options, like the dilly bird, are kinda boring and bland to be honest. So, go with the more adventurous sandwiches.  I probably end up here once a week for lunch, it's hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Dilly's is a valley staple in the sandwich game. They've got an extremely tasty selection of soups, with Wisconsin cheese being the best (personal fave). They're sandwiches are top notch and made to order. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is a rare gem! Tasty food, good size portions, family friendly. I'll be going back to this place in a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is my favorite soup place. I always make my husband go here when I'm sick. I love the potato soup. I also like the gobbler sandwich, but the soup is so good I've been getting just that lately. My only complaint is that the soup servings are really small. I wish they had a bigger size."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the sandwiches and soups that come in the best bread bowls around. Try the Wisconsin cheese, as it is the best soup on the menu in my opinion, and others will agree."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Dilly Bird sandwich and their soup bread bowls!!! The location is easy to access, there's ample parking, and the lunchtime rush isn't too bad. This is a bread heavy place so if you're scared of carbs you probably don't want to go here... but their sandwiches are pretty good. I definitely missed this place when I wasn't in Arizona."}
{"text":"love the chicken noodle soup in bread bowl.  sandwiches are awesome as well."}
{"text":"Went to Dilly's for the first time and thought it rang a bell...obviously not realizing it's widespread Yelp success. Being in the dead heat of summer I can't really go for soups, other than gazpacho soup.which I have yet to find in Phoenix.  Went with my girlfriend. I had a very delicious and filling \"Gobbler\" (Turkey, lettuce, cream cheese, cranberry sauce and mayo), very similar to those familiar with Sack's Improv sandwich. She had a Mexiwrap. Had a bite of it and found it a bit clayish and clumpy not to mention that there were a lot of jalapenos. Other than, definitely worth another visit. As all other good places, just wish they had more locations, at least through Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time eating from here and I gotta say the food is delicious. My favorite is the Southwestern Club on wheat bread! It's moderately priced and you can call ahead to have your food ready. 

The guys working there are really down to earth and made my sandwich exactly how I like it. Most deli places are shy on the meat but this place will satisfy your hunger without resorting to fast food. It just seemed like everyone eating here didn't seem disappointed. You know the place is good when the local police are swarming here on lunch breaks to get a sandwich or some soup.My job isn't too far from here so I have a feeling this will be the place to go every so often. Kudos Dillys on your excellent food and service."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in AZ hands down!

It's all in the bread. Since they make their own bread on-site, it makes your sandwich tasting experience so much better. The aroma and that first bite into your sandwich cannot be put simply. You will need to check a thesaurus to come up with better adjectives to express your experience here.

The italian focaccia and wheat bread are the best, especially the focaccia. I stand by the staple Dilly Club. They don't short you on meat.

Other greats are the Blazing Buffalo, Dilly Bird and the Vegetarian Special. 

All terrific and delicious. 

This is the kind of place that will have you coming back the same week."}
{"text":"Great bread bowls. The wraps were awesome too. This is the only place in the valley that I know of that sells bread bowls."}
{"text":"Place was ok it was a mediocre sandwich with no veggies other than onion I had the southwest club, and a bread bowl of clam chowder which was pretty decent would I go back? probably not"}
{"text":"I have only had the Cheese Soup in a bread bowl here, but it is worthy of four stars.  My boyfriend has had the BLT and he said it was good, not that you can really mess up a BLT.  They have a large sandwich menu, soups, salads and sides."}
{"text":"OMG so good. Recommended by our hotel staff. Did not disappoint. Lived up to the reviews and recommendation!!!  A definite second trip here is planned before leaving AZ"}
{"text":"Great sandwich!! Had the gobbler, added chipotle mayo and WOW it was amazing!!! Portions are HUGE, could have easily shared the whole! Can't wait to come back and try the soups in a bread bowl!"}
{"text":"The kids and I always love coming by here for a quick healthy sandwich!  Their sandwiches are not only delicious but customer service is great!!!  Kids usually order their PB&J or Turkey

Hubs-  Wife always brings me home something so I've never physically been to this place, but must say I love eating their food."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. Everything is always so fresh and their soups in a bread bowl are to die for. The staff is always friendly and fast. They also deliver and do catering."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing, and the staff is very friendly. Richard makes the most ah-mah-zing sandwiches!!! If you want to eat good food, this is the place :)"}
{"text":"I-LOVE-THIS-PLACE!!! Noodle soup in a bread bowl . . . can't go wrong, makes me happy every time!"}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches, sides, and soups. It's basically exactly what you would hope a deli spot would be: fast, affordable, and tasty. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Still my favorite sandwich in the Valley. They closed the location bear me in North Phoenix so I drive to Tempe to get my fix. The Club and Dilly Bird are our go to Sammies."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been driving by this place without going in for years now! I finally stopped in the other day and I'm already enamored with the place. Great sandwiches! Creative, simple, and elegant. Wonderful breads too! The doughs are apparently made every morning so the bread is fresh! Not frozen or outsourced like everyone else. My only complaint would have to be the size of the menu. It's average sized so it's not bad but with such good sandwiches I'd love to see a lot more!"}
{"text":"This in the BEST place to get a great sandwitch, I would add a whole page about this place but you still have to go try it for urself. get the half sandwitch and half soup your first time to try it out. Dont worry you will be back for more. I have been here more times than my checks say, ateast over 10."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMDilly's!    I meet my son and his work crew here every Thursday for lunch. What a treat!  Chris goes for the enchilada soup, that's their soup of the day. The way it's served is awesome, in a huge bread bowl. What's not to love? I crave the 'Gobbler' sandwich, sliced turkey,with cranberry sauce, cream cheese and other goodies. MMMMMM, you also get a choice of side with it , and they are all good. Price is right for what you get, huge portions of fresh baked bread and fresh ingredients. Always a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli reminds me of an East Coast Deli because of how good their bread for sandwiches and soup bowls are! Plus, they have so many options its ridiculous and their lunch special for 1/2 sandwich, drink, and chips is unbeatable. 

I'm a total sucker for their Veggie Supreme sandwich, I love anything with cream cheese and alfalfa sprouts. It sounds weird but don't knock it 'til you try it."}
{"text":"I dont hate this place but it's certainly not worth going to twice. I went here because i was very hungry and too lazy to make anything at home. 

I came here with my boyfriend and had the humdinger (pastrami sandwich) and cream of broccoli soup in their bread bowl. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and caesar salad. The whole experience was blah. My sandwich was bland and though i appreciate the bread bowl my soup came in, both the bread and the soup were blah. I did enjoy the buffalo chicken sandwich though so if you chose to come here I recommend this."}
{"text":"Wait, I didn't know Dilly's Deli was this good! Why didn't anyone tip me off earlier?

You know how some deli shops only put a few slices of meat on their sandwiches? That isn't a problem at Dilly's. There was a good amount of meat in my Italian sandwich...and the flavor was unbeatable too. The bread seemed fresh-baked and exceeded my expectations with regards to flavor. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So, I was sitting alone in my hotel room and debating on going out. Then, I started thinking how sad and lonely that would be... My friend raves about grubhub, and I decided to give it a shot. Didn't want a big salad, didn't really want a burger, didn't want pizza, so I decided to get a sandwich. 

I picked Dilly's at random and the reviews. I ordered a Smokey Mountain with double meat, avocados, cucumber, tomato, red onion, and lettuce. OH MY!!!  The sweet and savory dressing, super clean and fresh veggies, and amazing meats made this a sandwich for the ages. The bread is a story of its own. 

Order showed up early, just what I wanted. Couldn't be happier. Highly recommend. Highly."}
{"text":"PROS AND CONS...

Soup in bread bowls are hard to find in AZ! And theirs are pretty tasty!

However, the chicken salad sandwich I just ordered 10 mins ago which has prompted me to write this review was absolutely DISGUSTING. It tasted like a sour cream and dill weed dip on bread that had way too much butter on it? I took two bites and threw it away. Bummer deal, never again.

I normally get the dilly bird or the bbq chicken (Which are great!), so I guess I will stick with those."}
{"text":"Meh!! This is a typical AZ hyped up joint. I have eaten here twice. Both times have left much to desire. First off the bread was toooo freakin thick. The meats are not very high quality in flavor or texture. I just don't get why people think it's sooo good. I have some good sandwiches in my life from some of the most famous in NY and LA to San diego and SF. This place sucks in comparison to most. Not my kind of place. Hell Miracle mile is 10 times better than this place and I don't really prefer that either but I would go there over this Silly dilly place!"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches and awesome bread bowls. I love the lobster bisque on Fridays in a bread bowl. Good selection of breads if you dont like the one recommended for the sandwich. For me bread makes or breaks a sandwich and theirs are money."}
{"text":"The store is very clean, and looks a lot newer and bigger on the inside than it does on the outside. I got my order to go, which was chicken noodle in a bread bowl. The bread bowl was cold when I took it out of the bag, and I had to microwave it for a few seconds. The soup tasted amazing but the bread was pretty bland and got soggy VERY fast. Basically the bread bowl was just a dinner roll with a hole punched in the middle of it. I read someone else's review about the man scratching his behind and then returning to making the sandwiches and also thought that was pretty gross. I have to commend them for having the coke soda machine with over 100 flavors, though. I will probably just eat somewhere else next time, but it wasn't too bad of an experience."}
{"text":"Food is great. If you want delivery - call early! I recommend the Dilly Bird on focaccia. It's so good that I haven't tried any of the other sandwiches. Probably eaten there 20 times. Good stuff."}
{"text":"It's a strange thing:  I first moved to Phoenix in 2004.  I moved to Southern California and then BACK to Phoenix in 2008.

While in Southern California, I was legitimately homesick for this place.  I missed how easily accessible everything was.  Phoenix may indeed be a spread-out city but that's nothing in comparison to So. Cal.  You can easily make it here without a car.  We have the light rail and a pretty decent bus system.  The Orbit in Tempe is free, for God's sake.

A lot of things made me miss the place.  One thing in particular, as strange as it sounds, was Dilly's Deli.  Before I moved away from Arizona, I had only eaten at Dilly's twice and both times it was an amazing experience.  I love that they put the sandwich on that thing that simultaneously grills and smooshes my sandwich into this toasty creation of genius.

The prices are more than I feel like paying most of the time, but every so often I get a ghostly smell of Dilly's all up in my nose... a nasal memory of something.  It's like my nose is zoning out and decides to remember how certain things smell.  Sometimes, Dilly's becomes so fresh in my mind and it weirds me out a little bit.

This place is perfect for dining under a lot of different circumstances.  It's great for days off where you slept in way too late, it's past 11:00 a.m. and you're starving.  You'll plug your gut up good.  It's good if you just hanging out, too.  I always liked the interior.  I always enjoyed just chilling and taking my time and eating there, waiting for 6:00 to roll around to hit up a movie or go to a show or something.

If you have a buddy coming in from out of town, Dilly's Deli would be a good choice to bring them to for lunch."}
{"text":"Dilly's serves up a great sandwich or salad. Simple menu with fresh bread and toppings. You can't go wrong. 

This location has friendly, competent staff and at noon on Friday there was plenty of seating. 

I had the large Dilly's House with tuna and wasn't disappointed. Fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumbers & mushrooms. Their tuna is in the sweet-wet side but perfect on greens. As a Bonus, you get a large slice of toasted-to-perfection bread!"}
{"text":"The half sandwich and soup bread bowl is plenty for a grown man. You can sub the bread bowl for chips i think but the bread bowls are awesome. Fresh and filed with a soup of your choice. The place can get busy for lunch so get there early. Parking can be a pain at the University location if its busy as well. I've never had a bad thing on their menu, everything is amazing, they have a variety of breads for your sandwich and can custom make it if you wanted to leave off something. Seating for large groups is possible just need to get there early, they have tables that can be put together but like i said i've gone alone sometimes w absolutely no place to sit. They have outdoors but only good in the cooler months."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much at this grab and go Dilly's Deli since everything was pre-made and in plastic wrap.  We grabbed a Chicken Caesar wrap and a Turkey Bacon Avocado Club sammie.  Prices were actually reasonable for airport food ie under $10 each.  The wrap was fresh but lacked Caesar salad dressing which made it very bland.  On the other had the club sandwich was delicious.  The sweet tang of the dressing, creamy fresh avocado, moist turkey, crunchy red onions, smoked bacon and thick soft bread combined for one tasty sandwich.  The bread was a little too think and we ended up throwing a lot of bread away but we would order this sammie again in a heartbeat.  Avoid the wrap get the sammie, pretty decent airport food."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is a great sammich place in Chandler, and I frequently habit this place due to the excellent prices, service, and convenient location. They have free WiFi, btw, which is a nice touch, and located in a strip mall that also houses some other great establishments."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is a simple, fast causal sandwich shop that serves up Boar's Head brand meat, soup & salad.  The place is really bare bone basic , you order at the counter and you pick up at the other end when your name is called.  Yes, it's on the pricey end of my scale mainly b/c you are getting Boar's Head meat & cheese (this stuff is not cheap even @ the market) but you can still make thing work if you know how. 

My favorite here are:

Dilly Bird (4.5*)  Loaded with turkey slices, cream cheese, avocado, sprouts, mayo...all toasted together...so good!

Creamy Chicken Noodle (4*) - super rich & creamy ck soup loaded with ck,  noodle, carrots & celery (comes w/ homemade bread bowl)

Tips on saving some $$ - 

1) Go with the Daily Special - $4.79 for any 1/2 sandwich & a side

2)  there's always a coupon insides the \"San Tan News\" located by the entrance  (20% off)

3) come on the weekends when kids meals are FREE (with another paid entree, the $4.79 special works too).  Chicken soup is even on the kids meal menu!!!

4) don't forget your punch card


Cons - 
- Tap water taste awful, skip that if you can
- Sandwich looks dinky on the huge basket it comes on

{"text":"Time to update my review. The name of the place has changed to Dilly's Sandwiches. The prices have gone up some over the last couple of years.  The staff is friendly. I had the large cream of potato soup today ($5.50) in a bread bowl. It had a full bodied taste, but the bacon bits in it are scarcer than in past years. The half sandwich and small soup that used to be under $7 is now over $10.
The physical set up remains unchanged with tables and chairs inside and a few tables and chairs in front of the store under the overhang. Parking is much tighter than it used to be because Rio Salado college has moved into this shopping center."}
{"text":"I love their soup, and that they offer free kids meals on the weekends. My kids are always great eaters here."}
{"text":"Three words: \"Humdinger on Rye\"

...what an amazing sandwich. Am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Be sure to call in your order at Dilly's if youre going for lunch.  Its packed every weekday and you do end up waiting for a bit.   But its a good atmosphere if you have to wait, Tempe business folks and college students alike enjoy meals here.  There is seating outside and inside is always clean.  

I really like Dill's sandwhiches and soups...quality ingredients (Boar's Head meat) and awesome bread.  Although I will say the bread outweighs the insides of the sandwhich usually, and that annoys me.  I go for extra meat and cheese and take half home, but thats just me."}
{"text":"Get your toasted sub here instead of dealing with the potheads at the Cheba.  They taste better and there is actually room to sit."}
{"text":"I just had a rueben sandwich delivered and it was good.  Thanks for the fast response.  Military friendly too.  You will be my sandwich place from now on"}
{"text":"Great Food & Service, No Frills!

This place is wonderful for a quick sandwich, soup, or pickle during your lunch break.  I had their Turkey and Avocado sandwich -- and it left my mouth watering long after the sandwich was gone.  

They also have a great selection of Dr. Brown sodas (as well as the normal fountain selection)."}
{"text":"Can this place make a sandwich or what!?!  I continue over and over again to bring friends to this place for lunch...Just to eat the bread!

The soup in a bread bowl is killer!  The bread used for sandwiches is killer!  The students that frequent the place for lunch is killer!  and the parking will kill you if you come at lunch...Very difficult to park there...so be prepared!

I give it a four out of five stars because of the parking situation , otherwise it would get a five star!"}
{"text":"Great bread and sandwiches. 

Nimrod employees."}
{"text":"This place is fresh, delish and quick. Both times I have gone I called my order in and it's waiting for me when I get there! At work if one of us gets dilly's the rest will follow all day"}
{"text":"Sure the food is good, but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once.  The people making the food look so high you would think you were at Cheba Hut, but I just love that damn Broccoli and Wisconsin Cheese soup!  Their fresh dark rye bread is always great.

I enjoy the Italian quite a bit and the wife LOVES their tuna salad.  Great healthy place for food if they aren't too high to get your order right."}
{"text":"I used to rave about this place, but the last two or three times I have been there I have been disappointed.  We keep getting sandwiches with lettuce that is extremely wilted and has brownish edges.  Also the sandwich toppings aren't spread evenly.  We will probably continue to get Dilly's Deli but not at this location."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! The blazin' buffalo is my favorite! I also like the dilly bird and dilly club. LOBSTER BISQUE ON FRIDAYS IS BACK!!!! Get food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"For many years, Dilly's was my saving grace for a lunchtime option when I worked in Tempe. Although I could never escape the smell of fresh bread for the rest of the day, the quality of sandwich was worth the smell. 

Dilly's is a great deli if you need to get in and out in a timely manner while still being able to enjoy a decent meal along the way. Whether it's their salads or sandwiches, I am a fan of whatever they serve. Don't get me started on the sugar cookies. Those little bits of baking delight probably cost me a pound or two, but it was worth every bite. Any deli that serves fresh avocado gets a star in my book and not only does Dilly's serve it, they pile it on. The bread is always fresh (hence the smell) and the sandwiches are served with just the right amount of warmth to them. 

If you visit, here are my top choices:

- If you like cream cheese and avocado, go with the Dilly Bird 
- Veggie supreme but add turkey
- Honey Do if you are a fan of honey mustard 
- Greek Wrap 
- Clam Chowder 


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Dilly's Deli, but this store shamed the name. The bread in the bread bowl was hard, the sandwich (Dilly Club) looked slopped together, and half the ingredients seemed rotten."}
{"text":"Better than most sandwich places. 

Calling it a \"deli\" is an insult to a true deli.

Little on the expensive side so I go only when I have a coupon to make the prices more reasonable for the amount of actual food you get ... I don't count bread as food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The sandwiches are huge and the soups are awesome.  Priced from $6.99 and up for full sandwiches and $6.59 for half sandwich/soup combo, it can fill up big and small appetites alike.  I've had days where I would order the soup and sandwich combo and have just eaten the soup and take home the sandwich to finish off later because I'm stuffed from the soup and bread bowl."}
{"text":"Although I would call myself a foodie, I have to admit that I tend to limit myself and order a sad protein salad whenever I am out at a restaurant....  Sometimes these salads astonish me, but often I am left drooling over the meal I see across from mine at the table.  Maybe this is because instead of seeing a beautiful bowl of pasta, I see another dimple of cellulite forming on my left thigh...gross.
 
Anyways, moral of this story is that today at Dilly's Deli I broke my own cardinal rule and ordered none other than...a sandwich!  ::applause:: 

My dining partner choose the spot as a great place to celebrate the 60th day of my 60-day Bikram yoga challenge and WOW she made a great choice!  As other Yelpers noted, this is not the place for ambiance, but because I love my best friend so much, this issue did nothing for us.  We had plenty of hilarious post-church-types to stare at.  
We each got a different sandwich so that we could trade and essentially try 2 different things.  My choice was the Mexi wrap-Grilled chicken, sour cream, avocado, colby/jack cheese, fresh salsa and jalapenos in a cilantro jalapeno tortilla.    Ashley M. ordered the Dilly bird-Turkey, avocado and cream cheese with alfalfa sprouts
and mayo.  For our sides we tried the potato salad and chipoltle cole slaw and had to split a chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  

100% loved the food!
FRESH FRESH FRESH!  It was one of those meals that I walked away feeling completely satisfied!  I shall return!"}
{"text":"I've got two words for you, \"chipotle slaw\". YUM!"}
{"text":"First I want to give a shout out to the two ladies behind the counter who were so nice and helpful.  The sandwiches are really nothing special.  The bread is way too thick and there is nothing special about the ingredients.  The sandwiches here are perfectly fine and the restaurant is clean but I wouldn't waste the calories here again."}
{"text":"Boar's Head meat and thick toasted bread make these sandwiches some of my favorite.  The soups are okay, but put them in a fresh bread bowl and who cares?  The Southwestern Club is my fave with the tasty raspberry mustard.  The sandwiches are huge but they are so good you may not be able to stop after half of one.  The shop itself takes the minimalist approach so don't expect any fancy decor."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their Southwest Sandwich is awesome. Would have 5 stars if the pricing weren't so steep."}
{"text":"Solid take-out wraps to bring with you on the plane!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is so good, and the service is always great, too! I grew up with this place, and I am so happy that it has gotten better than I remember! (and so many fond memories growing up). I always switch up what I order.. There is so much to get! Can't go wrong with the soups, wraps, sandwiches, everything!"}
{"text":"Super good sandwiches, soups, brownies.  Fast service.  My favorite is the Smokey Mountain which has smoked peppered turkey, bacon, smoked Gouda, red onion and Russian dressing.  (No collusion).  The help is friendly and place is always clean."}
{"text":"For so long I've looked for a place that delivers soup and Dilly's Deli Delivers!  The soups are creamy and delicious, I can't get enough, I've had them all.  Plus they have bread bowls which is the best soup companion.  The sandwiches are also really good, I've only had the Dilly Bird but it beats any of the other sandwich places in the area."}
{"text":"Get the Ruben extra meat!! This place is pretty good for a smaller sandwich shop. The breads are great, the meats are great and the place is pretty clean. Good place to stop if you want a good ol fashioned sandwich."}
{"text":"So dissapointed, Dilly's Deli is officially closed, as of December 23. Permanently, according to the sign on the door!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to say that our experience was one that left us wishing we had gone somewhere else for lunch. I ordered a Tuna Melt on Wheat with Tomato Bisque soup, my husband had a Southwest sandwich on Sourdough and my son had Mac & Cheese. My Tuna Melt arrived on white as opposed to wheat, which is not a big deal. It was the flavor of the tuna that had me gagging. It tasted like it was 75% sweet relish and the \"melt\" part of the sandwich consisted of half melted American Cheese. Not what I expected, considering their high price point. The tomato bisque soup was bland and was much more bread bowl than a good serving of soup. The contents of my husbands sandwich were fair, but the sourdough bread was rock hard. It was like a sandwich on crostini. My son's Mac & Cheese was not fresh and was nothing more than Kraft, straight out of the box. Throw beverages and a brownie and we had a $25 meal that was far from worth it.
To make matters worse, my husband went back inside to order lunch for a colleague and noticed that the man making the sandwiched paused his work several times to scratch his backside and the continued right on preparing food. 

I frequented Dilly's a lot at the University Dr and Scottsdale locations years ago and really miss their fresh sandwiches, piled high with fillings. The quality has really declined seemed to decline and it doesn't seem that you get your money's worth anymore.

Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Dilly's Deli! So we've had a few things off of their menu and let me tell you! You will not be disappointed! The focaccia bread is to die for! If you happen to be around one of these delis you must go in."}
{"text":"The food here is seriously delicious. If you want a sandwich, forget the chains, come here.  The brunette girl taking the orders and making the food was super nice and quick. I am kinda a picky eater and asked for recommendations and she asked if I wanted one custom made and I said that would be great! She made a killer sandwich for me and they even have a Red Bull fridge (my favorite) to go along with the sandwiches. The food here is very fresh, it taste like a good wholesome homemade sandwich that reminds you of mommas house. After going to Dilly's places like subway, jimmy john's, etc, don't even compare. Being an ASU students, this place is close to campus and easy to get to, and now my favorite spot for lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places in the valley. And it's tucked into this seemingly lackluster strip mall. All of their sammy's are great  but something about the potato soup keeps me coming back. It could (and often is) 110 degrees outside and I'll still chow down on potato soup in a delicious bread bowl. 

Worth noting: the pot holes in the parking lot are no joke. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Great place to get sandwiches & soup. They have a great variety on their menu.  I think they're a tiny bit tight with the meat and avocado but then again their \"half sandwich\" is gigantic.  The soup is served in a bowl made out of bread! We will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Better than a Jimmy Johns and Jersey Mikes and Subway. They offer a good selection of sandwiches and breads. I had the Humdinger (Pastrami, pepper jack cheese, chipotle slaw) which is pricer ($7.49) but its a hearty sandwich including a side. Normally I consume a foot long at Subway but I only finished half my sandwich here.

Born and raised in the SF, the city of the best crusty hearty sour dough bread, I have never seen a white loaf bread bowl. The bread bowl had no chance of holding up to the soup nor is it pleasant to eat afterwards. It absorbs the liquid and becomes completely soggy."}
{"text":"I generally love dilly's. The soup and sandwiches are delicious and the ingredients are super fresh. Last time my sandwich fillings were skimpy and I wasn't particularly pleased with that.  The clam chowder bread bowl is on point."}
{"text":"Dilly's has incredible sandwiches made to order with fresh ingredients. Soups are tasty"}
{"text":"What can I say? Dilly's Deli is a classic in the Tempe area. Awesome place to get a delicious sandwich for a descent price and be able to get in and out fairly quickly.

I personally like the gobbler. Great taste of Thanksgiving without the \"I ate WAY too much\" feeling."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! Best bread in town. The Dilly Club and the clam chowder are my go to. It's tucked away in a strip mall, but don't eat that keep you away."}
{"text":"I didn't realize Dilly's was a chain until I went to add my review to yelp. Dang! I though I had \"discovered\" this place! Ah well, the food still tastes as good. 

Dilly's bread is the bomb. Baked-before-your-eyes, this bread is the perfect combo of crusty outside and soft yummy goodness inside. The meat is Boar's Head and piled high. The soup is great, esp. the clam chowder, cream of broccoli and Wisconsin cheese. And even if it weren't, it's served in a bread bowl-- so who cares?"}
{"text":"Great good for sandwich and soup combo.  Sign up and sign in .. I always get something free - nice perk for continuing to go there."}
{"text":"Dilly's deli is delicious! The fresh, homemade bread makes the sandwiches! Love the gobbler it's like thanksgiving any day of the week! The soup bowls are great too! During the week at lunchtime this place is packed! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, until I asked for a gluten free bun. The bun was in fact not gluten free because I got very very sick after eating the sand which. I called the store and in a very calm manner explained that they might want to say gluten sensitive and not gluten free because I understand that sometimes things happen. The reaction I got was tragic. The person on the phone told me that there must have been cross contamination with the regular flour (if that's a problem then there's probably cross contamination elsewhere yuk!) and that I should probably just not come back. Well not to worry dillys neither me nor my family nor my boyfriends family will ever come back."}
{"text":"Man, what a sandwich. I called in my order (for the Dilly Club - no tomato) and it was ready when I picked it up. In addition to my sandwich I ordered a couple of their Valentine's Day sugar cookies because a portion of the proceeds when to the Phoenix Children's Hospital - which made me feel good :}

the sandwich was flavorful and VERY filling, the cookies were awesome - though I got kinda sick after eating one because they were huge! and very rich."}
{"text":"Nothing about the Italian sandwich is Italian. It was gross. I've never not finished an Italian sandwich until today. The Wisconsin Cheese soup tastes like Velveeta. My water was my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and great service. I ordered ahead with a large group and we requested that they fill 25 styrofoam cups with ice water. Usually some places would be reluctant to do so or give attitude but the employees were awesome and willing to help! 

In terms of the food I thought the sandwich was awesome! I ordered the southwest club on sour dough. Really delicious a little dry so next time I'd ask for more honey mustard but overall really tasteful. Will come back here again and I definitely recommend this sandwich place."}
{"text":"My favorite deli hands down.  I love the chicken salad sandwich with wheat bread and sprouts.   Why is it so hard to find a place with alfalfa sprouts?   Their bread is so good and fresh.   Also love the potato soup in bread bowl.  And if you love brownies you have to try theirs, they are the best."}
{"text":"Great lunch stop in Tempe.  Huge sandwiches with flavorful ingredients and a variety of side choices.  This place evens has multigrain bread options.  I have had two different turkey variety sandwiches and both were bursting with flavor.  Service is quick,.  My sandwich was so stacked that I couldn't eat my chipotle coleslaw side.  That's saved for later.  Dolly's is a great big sandwich chain alternative at a competitive price.  Stop here, it's nice."}
{"text":"As my first visit, I was thoroughly disappointed. We showed up wanting a half sandwich and an order of soup.  They were out of soup. We settled on the full sandwiches with a side order. We ordered fountain drinks to wash down the food. Half of the fountain drinks were not available. I ordered the Italian with the chipotle slaw. The sandwich was alright. The slaw tasted like it was spiced with noting more than a lot of black pepper. 

The aftermath left me and my date in the restroom for a good amount of time regretting our decision to eat at Dilly's Deli. 

With that being said, I have no reason or desire to return."}
{"text":"I have always loved Dilly's for sandwiches.  Their potato salad is one of my top two favorites of any that I have ever eaten.  I used to get the Honey-do, but their new menu doesn't have it, so I opted for another sandwich that was just as tasty with a sweet mustard on it.  

I hadn't been to Dilly's in about a year because I moved to the Northwest Valley where they don't exist, so when I handed them my almost filled punch card, they told me they don't use them anymore.  All was not lost however, because they let me exchange my punch card for a free sandwich!  Done!  Gotta love Dilly's!"}
{"text":"Not too many things come to mind when thinking about Dilly's. They make tasty, super expensive sandwiches. (Usually around 15 bucks for a 'meal' here). I love a great sandwich but this place must clean up in profits. The sandwiches aren't quite inventive enough for me, considering most of the ingredients they use are run of the mill things. 

I guess kids eat free on weekends so that is fine. The decorations are as vanilla as you can get, and you can't really watch sports here. Sometimes they float around good coupons if you and a friend want to split the cost of one meal (again, be prepared to pay as much as a whole meal (7-8 bucks) at W.M. Sacks, a much better sandwich place with unfortunately limited hours). 

Come here if the only other options around it are known to be bland and/or fast food."}
{"text":"Love this sandwhich shop! They always have fresh bread and ingredients. The counter help is always right on. I ordered the veggie supreme but told them to hold the ranch dressing. The cashier did one up and offered his version of the veggie and the different things I could do without the ranch. I didn't take his advice this time but great to know that they make these suggestions to offer alternatives to your sandwhich experience. When I asked about the soups being veg/vegan friendly he knew exactly how to direct me. This week only the tomatoe soup was vegan- and yes it was delicious! They do hot and cold sandwhiches, wraps and salads. 

If you love a good sandwhich give Dilly's a try!!!"}
{"text":"Coming in a I was a little hesitant. I ordered the southwest club with a side of cheesy soup. The sandwich was so perfect, the sweetness of their raspberry honey mustard sauce contrasted well with the paperback and the avocado. I will be definitely coming back here. Maybe try the dilly bird with the tomato bisque. Long live the sammich!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice in the 3 days since I moved to Tempe and am extremely grateful to have found this gem (thanks Yelp!).  I eat between 5-10 sandwiches a week and have no doubt that I will be getting several of those from Dilly's.

The first time I ordered a sandwich, I was a bit put off by the thickness of the bread;  I did not want the bread to overwhelm or disguise the flavor of the meats/cheeses/sauce.  However, the bread (foccacia) was actually quite soft and complemented the sandwich (the Smokey Mountain) quite well.  Nonetheless, I would warn that if you really are opposed to eating a relatively large amount of bread with your sandwich, you might prefer something else, or perhaps one of the wraps offered here (though I haven't tried any of those yet).

Also, it'd be nice if nutritional information were made available on the website.  One of the main reasons that 80% of my sandwich consumption has been at Subway/Cosi/Potbelly is that I know the nutritional content of what I'm eating.  

I hope to come here as many times as possible before the ASU onslaught begins in a few weeks...I hope the lines aren't out the door when classes start...although I suppose I will just eat lunch at 2 if that's the case."}
{"text":"Dillly's is delicious!!  I had the 1/2 Smokey Mountain with a bread bowl of potato soup and they were both great.  The potato soup was some of the best I've ever had.  The hubs had the Hawaii 5-0 and it was yummy too, definitely a win if you're looking for some spice but would be just as good if you decided to forgo the jalapeños.  And apparently kids eat free on the weekends at Dilly's.  We were pleasantly surprised by that tidbit after looking at our receipt and realizing that we were credited the kids meal :).  The place is in a vacant strip mall but is very clean and the staff was friendly.  Only negative is that all of the trash cans were full, even the ones outside.  Will definitely hit this place up again if we're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Staff here are great, they are very friendly and make rounds to make sure your food is good. If not, they offer to remake it or get you something else instead. Southwest Club is my favorite, and they do have fresh baked treats such as cookies and brownies."}
{"text":"Mmm bread. Mmm sandwich. Mmm soup. 

I've been going to this place forever for all my sandwich needs. They provide it every...single...time."}
{"text":"I went here today with my mom and my two kids. We ordered a sandwich and a salad and a drink and 2cookies.  I brought my kids meals since one is gluten free and one barely eats and didn't want to waste money on them.  We were done with our meal when i took my boys to the bathroom and saw that they have free kids meals on weekends when adults purchase meals! Wtf would they have the sign in the bathroom!! I could have got my kids meals all along!  The guy even charged us for the 2cookies when i could have got 2meals a drink and cookies for free!! It would have been nice for him to say when ordering hey kids meals are free today..i even had 2other adults join us so we had 4adult meals and not once did he say kids eat free..very disappointed..i just gave my kids water that i brought,they could have had juice or something else..not good service..when i was going to say something when we were leaving he was nowhere to be found.."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good sandwich just like anybody else and Dilly's does a decent job.

While they use quality ingredients, their style of sandwich isn't really my favorite. I had the full sandwich portion and it is a generous helping, unfortunately, it's mostly bread. For me, the best kind of sandwich focuses on what's between the slices and serves up plenty of it.

The service was surprisingly efficient. There was a pretty big line of people when I walked in, but the staff managed the crowd very well and kept the line moving. I didn't have to wait long for my order either. They have a good system in place to get your order out in a reasonable amount of time.

I'll go back to Dilly's eventually, but it's not something I'll ever crave or go out of my way for. I want to give their soup a try; the bread bowls looked promising. If I'm in that area and craving soup, I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and priced right.  I order the Italian on rye just about everytime.  Had the mediterranean salad and it's pretty good and feeds four people for I believe 6 bucks.  I've been to the Scottsdale/Thunderbird location which is a dump, cafeteria style seating and the bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned in ages.  This one is set up nice though."}
{"text":"dilly's has to be one of my favorite sandwich shops of all time. they have such a wide variety of choices that anyone who comes can pick something to suit their taste buds. 

i always go for the blazin buffalo because i eat wing sauce on nearly everything. boars head meats on all their sandwiches which is great but jacks the price up quit a bit. a sandwich, drink, and a side was about $10. i went with the pasta salad as a side, which was nothing special, your average run of the mill pasta salad. my sandwich on this particular visit was lacking a sufficient amount of buffalo sauce and i neglected to ask for extra before i left, assuming that they wouldn't be stingy with it. the bread is good, they toast it so it tends to get soggy if you take it to go. the bread bowls are good too, i've had the clam chowder and chicken noodle and i recommend both.

service here is usually quite slow. even when it's not busy in there, like today around 2, i had to wait 10 minutes to get my sandwich and even saw some guy who was two people behind me get his order before me. when it's busy, you're going to be waiting even longer. they need to pick up the pace."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and soups.  I'm surprised that this place is priced about the same as Subway and Silvermines yet their food is way better.  Interior is a bit boring but hey who cares about that when you have good food!  

*If you join lunch club from my ticket, you get 20% off your lunch bill here"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in dillys. They used to be my favorite, but lately they've been slacking. First I got all soup with no chicken or noodles.. second, the bag rips open at my front door as delivery driver handed it to me and my food falls all over the floor.. got nothing out of that. And third, I just called for delivery and they put me on hold, then hang up on me? What's up Dillys! I think I'm gonna take a break from ordering or in store orders for a while because this is getting ridiculous."}
{"text":"i ordered the reuben sandwich on rye.  it was a great sandwich.  i also ordered some chips and a fountain drink with a side of potato salad.  all the food tasted great!

i went here for lunch and the parking lot was madness.  the line to even place your order was crazy.  bring some patience because it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very nice employees work at this location! That always increases the rating in my book. And the food was delicious too. I had the Sweet Leaf turkey Wrap. Everything was fresh from the greens to the tortilla. My side was the fruit salad and everything was perfectly ripe and juicy. Not one complaint!  My only suggestion would be to offer more types of brewed teas but since you have the giant multi-beverage dispenser, then I'm probably the only one who looks for multiple brewed tea flavors. Thanks Dilly's!"}
{"text":"I got the dilly club sandwich was good but the potato soups was pretty terrible ... I'd go back for the sandwiches but not so much for the soup"}
{"text":"I have no idea who Dilly is but they sure know how to make sandwiches!!!  I have devoured many a delicious meal from this joint and they have never disappointed me.  The interior lacks much creativity but who really cares when you are scarfing down some of the best sandwiches in the valley? The vibe is very college and laid back.  It can get hectic around lunch so if you go keep in mind that it might  take a while."}
{"text":"So I've taken one bite and...



This sandwich is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! That's all. I will absolutely one hundred percent recommend this place to any and everyone. I live one block away so they'll see me more than they probably want to. Sandwiches are served cold or hot. People are nice!!!!!"}
{"text":"While working at Shirts and Things, we'd order lunch from here every once in awhile. I'd always get the bread bowl soup and have them put half potato, half broccoli and cheese. A great combination! The bread itself was also good. I would always get the Gobbler too, which is like Thanksgiving between bread: turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing on marble rye. Delicious!
The delivery seemed pretty fast but the prices were a little high (around $7 for soup and bread or a sandwich is iffy for me)."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty!  There seems to be a lack of real deli's here in Tempe, but this is a real one!  Definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Generous portions, simple foods that are quick between flights and easy enough to bring with you on the plane. It is a much better option for me than bags of chips, chocolate bars and all the assorted garbage that is readily available in airports. It was a nice change up."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in college at ASU 15 years ago. I now live in Surprise and make the hour drive just to eat here about twice a month. BEST DELI EVER! Friendly staff, casual atmosphere and AMAZING food. My favorite is the Dilly Bird on rye with cheese soup. Eat here, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Yummy soups and sandwiches. Almost reminds me of a Panera Bread (For those of you from the East coast). Came here for lunch one day and the food was ready quickly. Very pleased with everything. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This is another time I long for half stars. I think Dilly's is better than a three but don't think it quite hits four... such is life. I've most likely had ninety five percent of the menu through the years and have rarely come across something I didn't enjoy. I love the Italian and the Gobbler and Kristen is a freak about their chicken noodle soup. My only true complaints are the interior, often cold and mighty boring, and the staff is hit and miss, most often warm and friendly, but sometimes I catch a big jerk. Three and three quarter stars. I like Dilly's."}
{"text":"Was unimpressed for the most part by the food. We were hoping to find a soup place that we could enjoy enough to make our regular go-to, but this place failed miserably. While it's nice that the price tag isn't too high, we realized that we would rather pay more for better food."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is right down the street from my house so I come here often on my break from work. It is a great place to get a good quality sandwich on fresh baked bread. The prices are not outrageous if you take advantage of the half sandwich with side deal for $4.79 with a drink it comes out to about $7.00. That is not bad considering the great quality of bread and deli meat that they serve. I usually order the buffalo chicken sandwich on wheat which is delicious. I had to take one star off because I used to love, love, love the chipolte cole slaw but they are no longer making it the same way. This was one of my main reasons for coming here because I loved the flavor of this cole slaw so much. They used to make it a little spicier with blended chipolte peppers but the last few times I have been here it has been bland and peppery with no chipolte. They should just call it cole slaw now. So overall I still think the quality of sandwiches is great and a pretty good price. I am a little disappointed about them changing the recipe of one of my favorite foods but I will still be coming back for the great sandwiches."}
{"text":"So I decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker. The ordering was easy enough and I was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am... I though sure not a problem... It got here at 1230... After I called to ask what was taking so long. No apologies or nothing... If you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly! It's my lunch hour! It was shortened thanks to you and your employees who don't give a damn. 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip.. Shoulda ordered something good for this price. I got the turkey sandwich  and it was rather forgettable. I don't think I will be ordering from this establishment again. Shoulda just got in n out."}
{"text":"Presentation was good, with a cute little mini bread bowl and the sandwiches looked stuffed. And I stress the word \"looked.\" The bread had a nice soft consistency but the crust on the bread was HUGE. But the soup was a bit salty, one sandwich had cheese only down one side (so each half only had cheese under my left hand when I held it) and the other sandwich they forgot to put cheese on altogether. The Humdinger is supposed to be topped with \"chipotle\" coleslaw but all I could taste in that slaw was the pepper from the pastrami. It was kind of pricey, too. I'm not so much into paying $18 for heartburn and some farts. Next time, I'll go to Bison Witch."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place in Tempe! Everything is fresh, this is always a treat to go to Dilly's. The Dilly Club & Chicken Noodle Soup are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great customer service ....staff was very understanding after I explained that two other ppl and I thought the chipotle slaw tasted old...smokehouse monthly special was really good...will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We grabbed some dinner here last night before catching a show at Gammage. 

We were the ONLY people in this place, yet the staff acted like they were slammed, very short with us and it took quite some time for our order to come out.

The food was good, though the bread bowls that the soup came in tasted like they were a few days old, very dry and crumbly vs the normal super fresh tasting bread bowls you get here."}
{"text":"I don't like delis but in the valley, Dillys is one of the few delis I actually enjoy eating at.
The Sky Harbor location however is a huge disappointment.  The quality of food at this location is no reflection of what you would get at a normal Dillys in the valley.
I am saddened to the k this is this first and perhaps only impression people might get of Dillys Deli."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to eat before seeing a movie. He always wants to go eat at a deli place and I usually turn him down because I am not a big sandwich person. Normally deli places don't have very much selection and I can be very picky. However, I remembered Dilly's Deli is a place that I loved. They have bread bowl with broccoli and cheese soup or clam chowder. Yum. I suggested it to my husband and he was so excited. We ate there and of course I ordered a bread bowl and salad. My husband ordered a sandwich and a bread bowl. He loved it. Now we have a place to go to when y husband is craving a sandwich. I gave Dilly's 4 stars only because the floor looked kind of dirty and it needs some decorations. It is pretty depressing in there, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I am a self-proclaimed sandwich expert and I was so happy to find Dilly's.  Everything about it is perfect.  I've only been in once, but can't wait to go back to make my way through the menu.  If only it was closer to where I work, I would go all the time."}
{"text":"Do not forget to order the soup. The soup stands out here . The sandwiches are equally good especially the Blazing Buffalo. 

The bread bowl is yummy and is a good place for lunch - though can get crowded at times"}
{"text":"Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional \"daily soup\" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return."}
{"text":"I've purchased sandwiches to go from Dilly's twice now and both times the sandwich tasted awful and the bread was somewhst hard.
So I won't be buying from Dilly's ever again."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon is always entertaining when attempting to find a place the entire family enjoys. Dillys deli offers mainly sandwich and soup options but they are very flexible when substituting anything on or off of their sandwiches. On this particular occasion, I came in with a gift card off of Local Flavor and unfortunately, the giftcard was a disaster. The man helping us was not very considerate and eventually gave us the $20 discount we purchased but not after a lengthy discussion on how we should have printed out coupon off and how this whole Local Flavor coupon was a nightmare. I felt badly, they couldn't control this situation, but I still would have asked for kind service. The restaurant was fairly busy after we ordered but excessively dirty. The soda machine was out of most of its flavors and the average wait time was 20 minutes for only 4 sandwiches. Interesting, considering the store wasn't that busy. I give Dillys Deli 3 stars because they have excellent sandwiches and generally offer great coupons off of Local Flavor as well as Groupon. The dirty store and Local Flavor debacle caused this experience to become 3 stars but I will continue I try Dillys again as they have given me 5 star experiences in the past."}
{"text":"I got a whole sandwhich with roast beef and cheddar cheese and a small cup of soup.... it was over 11$.... hahaha I about laughed when she told me the total... I couldve gone to pf changs for the same price... yikes! I mean the food is decent but they barely give you any meat. Literally like its a couple slices of roast beef in between 2 pieces of white bread. The only reason I didnt walk away was because I was to lazy to go somewhere else. Feel like I got robbed in a way. The weird thig is that when I went to the one in scottsdale it was only 9 dollars for the same thing so im a little confused maybe the cashier doesnt know what shes doing?"}
{"text":"I get dillys deli as delivery and its my fav! 
The gobbler is the best in my opinion:)
Thanksgiving on buns."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Every time I'm on that side of town it's my go to place!  Sandwiches are so fresh and the bread is amazing!  Can't go wrong with their soups either. The wrap is good to!  I've never had anything bad!  Give it a try you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I am not a big sandwhich person at all.
I need to start by saying that.
But... I really am glad I stumbled accidentally upon this gem.
Soup and half sandwhich for $7 is a good deal made even better if the soup can be in a bread bowl!   How to resist?  I didn't.  I got the pumpernickle and swiss and ham combo that i have revered as a child with a soup made of creamy chicken broth.
Why is lunchtime so short?!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

FOOD: I love my sandwiches, and Dilly's always satisfies me. The sandwiches are pretty big. I like the Smokey Mountain because any sandwich with bacon in it is twice as good as those without! I think you get a free cookie with your sandwich, not sure though. 

PRICE: Around $7 for a sandwich

ATMOSPHERE: Nothing amazing, but definitely good enough to sit down at.

SKINNY: For those of you who love your sandwiches for lunch, go to Dilly's Deli and you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh Dilly's how I wish I could give you more than 3 stars. 

Let's start with the good: super fresh baked bread for sandwiches (soup bread bowls are a different story), Boarshead meats, which is superior quality and excellent soups (seriously, try the baked potato). Kids eat free on Saturdays, which is typically a $5 savings per child- so remember that. The store is definitely kid friendly- you'll see that on a bust Saturday. 

But there are some downers too: the staff is generally \"short\" and impatient when you are ordering- just expect it Maybe it's an attempt to embrace the NYC east coast attitude but it doesn't work for me. As mentioned earlier, the bread bowls are usually not the most fresh- they keep them in a sack for who knows how long. Sometimes the soups are only lukewarm and not hot, a bummer because they are great tasting. OK- this is picky but the soup spoons they use are weird shaped and they always cut the corners of my mouth- seriously! I'm just saying- remember that comment when you try a soup next order. All sandwiches come on toasted bread and many times the bread is greasy because they added too much butter or whatever to cook/grill the bread- that can overwhelm the taste of the sandwich. 

You'll pay a good $25 for 2 people to eat a sandwich, small side, and regular soda. I guess that's on par with other premium sandwich shops- but sometimes Dilly's just doesn't live up to full potential. Oh well, I would still recommend to Yelpers to try for themselves."}
{"text":"Customer service has been awful two times I had to tell the person making the sandwiches that they need to change their gloves if they touch a rag or a credit car and then touch your food. 
That's cross contamination! Do they even have a foods handlers card? Besides that still believe is in a perfect location close to ASU."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is a GENEROUS 3 stars. If we could half star, this would be a solid 2.5. I am a big fan of the sandwich, this much is true. However, the Dilly's Deli sandwich leaves much to be desired. Unless of course by sandwich, you mean two ginormous slices of bread with very little in between them, then this is the perfect sandwich for you!

I've been to Dilly's several dozen times since it's a whole mile and a half from my office, and I prefer the cheap and easy route more often than not during my lunch break. While Dilly's may be easy, cheap it is not. $8 for a half a sandwich and tiny ass cup of soup is just not cheap to me, maybe it is to you, but well, then you'd be wrong.

I was coming down with a cold earlier this week (pretty much the only time I'll go to Dilly's anymore due to their wide selection of soups) and decided to make the trip. Please note that I was only going for a big bowl of soup. I also decided to get the Mexi Wrap because I thought the jalapenos might help clear my sinuses a bit. MISTAKE!!!

By the time I got back to my office (under 5 minutes, swear to god,) my soup was luke warm at the very best, and my Mexi Wrap was pretty much a pound of sour cream wrapped in a tortilla. Obviously not what I was looking for, not to mention sick!

The only saving grace of this entire meal was the brownie I bought. That delicious brownie alone is what made me benevolent enough to round up rather than round down.

I will give them another shot after I've moved on from that fiasco of a lunch, however if I am served cold soup one more time I am gone for good, I don't care how close they are to my office."}
{"text":"It's the perfect little soup and sandwich spot.  Dilly's has a few locations around the valley and all of them are wonderful.

The Hot Sandwiches are huge and filling, and they come with a classic side (potato salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, etc) and a pickle. Dilly's also changes up their menu a little bit every now and then. While it's a shame to see some of my favorites go, it's great that I can walk in and try something new.

Their soups are also phenomenal and come in a bread bowl. I recommend asking them to mix the potato soup with the cheese soup... Amazing! The salads are weak, but unless you're ordering one in a combo, it's not really what anyone is there for."}
{"text":"been eating Dilly's for years and man today was not their best showing.  kid at the register read back our order 4 times and didn't get it right once.  my wife still didn't get the right soup on try 5.  step it up Dilly's I will continue to eat your food but it'd be nice for that not to be a hassle."}
{"text":"I had the smoked peppered turkey, avocado, bacon, pepper jack red onion and raspberry-honey-mustard-sandwich and it was one of the highlights of my holiday season! What a sandwich and what a surprise to get at a little stand at an airport."}
{"text":"Just a small shop at the airport. They have sandwiches, salads, and a whole variety of drinks you can shop to.  Overpriced, but isn't everything at the airport?  
I think I was flying United, so its probably close to those gates.

I grabbed a salad and a bottle smoothie drink, not much to rave or complain about, food looked fresh and tasted decent."}
{"text":"Very nice people!  That's about it, truly.  I was appalled at the subpar quality of the food, I mean really, it was disgusting.  The service was also unbelievably slow, our order wrong, and the entire joint was sticky and dirty.  I am at a complete loss as to how anyone with an iota of taste could eat here and give it five stars...or four... or even three. It was borderline inedible.  I give two stars because they were nice, and it's perhaps family owned?  But do not, under any circumstances, subject your tastebuds or stomach lining to this food."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed that the food wasn't as good. They're definitely not the same as their first location by MCC. Food wasn't as good as I remembered. It's almost as if Café Zupas has become an updated version of Dilly's Deli."}
{"text":"Came in town for a meeting and had the smoky mountain sandwich for lunch, awesome is all I can say. Looked at everything else my colleagues were eating and all looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Just got lunch for the work crew. 3 out of 4 items wrong. Pay more attention."}
{"text":"I do like the dill. The brocolli soup bread bowl got me through many a stoned afternoon in my ASU days, and I hope it's still as good!

Once I dropped the vegetarian bull, I started ordering sandwiches here and was always delighted by the quality of the meats and cheeses and the freshness of the bread. It gets incredibly crowded  as one might expect, but that's okay. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my dad for a quick dinner. It took longer than expected to get two half sandwiches and two half salads, but it was worth the wait. Dilly's Deli has great sandwiches made with fresh ingredients. This place had very little decor and felt a little plain and empty. They did have some neat art painted on the walls though. They need to add some thing on the walls and tables. Maybe a few plants around the place (fake ones would work too). Overall, we were pleased with our meal and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Silly me. I thought ordering the Southwest Chicken Wrap meant that it would ACTUALLY have chicken in it. Very disappointed. For what they charge for this wrap I expect more than a few damn pieces of chicken. Probably won't go back here. Very upset. Was so hungry today and was excited for this wrap. I'm going to have to get more food somewhere else. My suggestion to you if you go here... don't order what I did."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place when I was in high school (which was a long time ago...I'll leave it at that)!, and over the past year or so I've rediscovered it (along with the location off Southern & the 101) and still really like it. 

Honestly, I can't think of anything in particular that makes this place REALLY stand out. It's just good, solid food. I normally get a half a sandwich & soup (in a bread bowl). Recently I've had the Southwest Club (I like the raspberry honey mustard) as well as the BBQ chicken, which is also really good. 

Normally I get the cheese soup or the cheese soup mixed with the potato. The soup is really good, but for whatever reason it's not AS good as I remember it (that's why I say I still \"really like\" this place as opposed to \"LOVE\" it), It's still tasty, but doesn't have as much flavor as I remember. Also, the past couple times I've been here the bread bowls were a bit stale.

Overall, Dilly's Deli is still a solid place for soup & sandwiches. The sandwiches in particular are good, and there's a lot of variety with not just typical offerings you'll see at most sandwich places."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, flavorful, with a lot of meat and vegetarian options to please any discerning palate.  They also offer soups and salads, which I hear are equally as delicious, and many different options for sides.  It's sad to see that this plaza, which used to house Michael's and several other stores, is now nearly defunct, and the last remaining vestiges of this plaza's prime days is this deli, Pong Pong Chinese food, which is right next door, and a few other specialty stores.

My favorite so far is the Southwest wrap.  The Buena Bella vegetarian sandwich, though touted as a healthy alternative, seems to be a bit too salty to make it really that healthy for you."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a coworker. I ordered the Humdinger, really just because I wanted to say it. It was underwhelmingly average...Nothing really stood out for me. It was busy, the service was average and the thick bread sandwich was similar to Schlotzsky's.  I could go again or I could skip it. It was just okay for me, dog."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite often. Always love the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 soup. I always get close to the same thing. Turkey and Swiss and either 1/2 wissconsin cheddar and 1/2 chic dumplin or potato soup. So the other day I was in and ordered the sandwich and the 1/2 wiss cheddar and 1/2 chic dumplin togo. When I got home my sandwich looked like someone sat on it and my soup was chic dumplin with shredded cheddar cheese on top. I was bummed about my lunch. But I will go again, maybe I can give em a higher rating next time. I will say they are priced very reasonable compared to other places.!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Dillys!  They are quite liberal with their portions so the half is often perfect for me."}
{"text":"This deli came recommended by a coworker who wanted to have a one on one business meeting here. I was was impressed by the fast service ( at the counter ). And the food was amazing !! I would recommend the Yahoo. I was a little jealous about my coworker selection, soup in a little bread bowl with a half sandwich looked amazing. I need to check this out next time I'm in the area again. I would recommend this little deli."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Today I ordered the combo (1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad) which was chicken salad on multigrain bread and a sweet leaf salad. My oh my. All that for just over $7 cannot be beat. I was so impressed by the freshness of everything. The salad: fresh whole-leaf spinach with feta cheese, walnuts, cranberries with balsamic vinegar.  It's been too long since I've eaten fresh lettuce at any lunch restaurant- bye bye Wendy's. The sandwich was stuffed with chicken chunks (not shredded) and the bread was toasted to perfection. I called up and ordered for pickup. Although the ASU location is closest to me it's very busy so I always opt for the new location at Price & Southern. A bit farther but never a wait. There is seating to accomodate about 10 tables. Friendly and healthy. Here is where you want to eat lunch!"}
{"text":"Went today to pick up a to-go order and was very disappointed.  

We ordered two salads and a sandwich with slaw.  While they mastered putting the tuna salad on the side of one salad, the dressing we ordered was missing.  Neither salad came with a side of bread.   

The sandwich was very large and good, however the slaw tasted a little \"funky\"  almost rancid.  


Also, to-go salads should come with forks...... just saying..."}
{"text":"1st timer. It was fine, nothing over the moon. But price was good for size of sandwich."}
{"text":"Switching to a 1. Literally ordered food to go and specifically requested pickles... no pickles were in the bag. What a joke. 



Great food but man, why is it always a struggle to get a damn pickle on the side. It ruins a whole meal. Would give 4 or 5 stars but the far too often pickle struggle you get a 2"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch this week and was STOKED to see that they brought back The Gobbler!

Always a good, filling meal"}
{"text":"It pains me to say that DD no longer has The Gobbler :-[

I don't know if/when I'll be back...."}
{"text":"This is another one of my absolute favorite spots, I hit it up consistently at least once a week for lunch. My favs are the Dilly Club and their chicken noodle soup. Everything is super fresh, aside from the random slightly stale breadbowl (although if you get one that's super fresh, it's like heaven!) It can get a little hectic in there, especially during peak lunch times, but the service is usually pretty good, they've only messed up my order on two occassions and they corrected it promptly. If you haven't had a Dilly's experience yet, go with the half sandwich/small soup combo, the soups are phenomenal and they all go well with the sandiwches. I usually break down and get a cookie, too...the double chocolate or the M&M are both equally worth checking out."}
{"text":"Meh....

I mean, everybody (from work to here) tells me that Dillys Deli is awesome.  So, maybe I went there with my expectations a little high...

But all i got was leaving the place smelling like a Dilly and feeling a little underwhelmed.

I got the vegetarian sandwich, which the cashier told me that the mushrooms were grilled.  (Negative...not cooked at all) It was alright, nothing to write home about. The pasta salad was just, well, pasta salad.  But my cookie was really yummy.

So, my review is...meh...."}
{"text":"The deli is in a strip mall, very non-descript, and the deli itself is fairly plain on the inside, no frills.  The value is in the sandwich alone, and for this it gets 5 stars.  They offer a wide variety of sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups -  and every sandwich seems to have a twist on your standard sub/deli sandwich, they have everything from a buffalo chicken sandwich to oven roasted portabella mushroom cap and your traditional veggie and italian types - ranging from 7-8$ most sit right at the 7.5 mark..  I tasted 4 sandwiches total outside my own and they were all rock solid performers.  I highly recommend this deli!

FYI - on thier website, for the allergic type, they have a complete allergy profile of each of thier menu items - highly useful for the allergic folk, and very, very kind!"}
{"text":"I've been to both the Chandler location and the Tempe location many times. The food is always consistently good. Their wheat bread is the best; my boyfriend and I didn't care for the sourdough. I love their soups! They're flavorful and come piping hot. Their chicken salad sandwich is delicious, as is their gobbler sandwich and the Italian sandwich. Their establishments are always clean and the staff is always friendly. I do think they're a bit pricey which is why I can't give the 5 stars but I'll still keep coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing soups and sandwiches. I love this place! You can't go wrong with the bread bowls. Mmmmm! 

Excellent catering service too, they were on time and every order was nicely labeled and bagged for each person in our 30-person group."}
{"text":"I got the \"Dilly Bird,\" which is just turkey, cream cheese, sprouts, and avocado. It was $7.19, for just those ingredients I figured it would have a decent amount of toppings... but it unfortunately did not. On each half of the sandwich there were 2 slices of avocado and a very thin layer of sprouts. Turkey was a decent amount though. I got it on wheat bread and the bread was delicious. Wasn't the best deli I have been too... which is unfortunate because this is the nearest deli sandwich place to me 
However the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Dilly's is a good place to go.  I enjoyed my food.  The one problem I have with places like this is the help.  The food is decent, but the help in places like this seems to not care.  I asked the girls who took my order to not put the honey vinaigrette on my sandwich, but to put light mayo on it.  The sandwich came with both Honey Vinaigrette and light may on it.  The Honey in the Vinaigrette was so prevalent, that all of you know, when honey is on bread it can get all over.  And this honey got all over my sandwich, my hands, my clothes, everywhere.  Not enjoyable.  The sandwich was good except for that.  I just wish places would start catering to the customers instead of taking us for granted all the time."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby and my boss would buy me meals (Jason, if you're reading this, thank you again for all the awesome meals and great conversation).

This place really puts chain places like Paradise to shame. There is no silver bullet way to make the perfect sandwich, and Dilly's knows this. I love that you can call in your order and have it ready for you when you get there. The patio is also great--I actually enjoy watching the cars and students go by on University around lunchtime.

I recommend the Buena Bella (for my fellow meatatarians and vegetarians alike) but also check out the BBQ Chicken, Southwestern Club, or the Blazing Buffalo (but you'll need to explicitly ask for red onions on that last one). Don't forget to grab a bag of chips and enjoy one of the best sandwiches in Tempe. :)"}
{"text":"We recently got a GREAT deal through Homerun.com for 1/2 off Dilly's Deli. We LOVE Dilly's and are always excited to eat there. The Dilly Bird is my ABSOLUTE favorite....fresh avocado and delicious turkey.....YUM! The bread is fresh and wonderful. The creamy potato soup is awesome. And I love that they make kids meals that are reasonably priced since we have 4 kids to feed. BEST sandwiches ever. We always leave happy (and full!)"}
{"text":"The day we tried this place, I was totally not in the mood for sandwiches. This place definitely changed my mind! Tried the Dilly Bird with a half salad, and it was ah-may-zing. Don't hesitate if you're into good sandwiches. The bread was fresh and artisan, and the sandwich was the \"can't talk while eating because it's so fabulous\" type. :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled into Dilly's Deli after a friend of mine was craving Roast Beef so I looked up delis on Yelp and this one was the closest with pretty good reviews.
I wasnt very hungry but I thought I would get something that I could nibble on and pick at throughout the day...
I got the Dilly's Club on wheat and it was really good
The bread tasted really fresh and the meat was great
The bacon was crisp
Oh, I happened to get the half sandwich, half soup so I chose the potato soup
and it too was yummy
It came with a big roll that was actually the bread bowl
I didnt use it as a bowl :) but it was yumzo!
The prices were pretty fair for a sandwich shop
I will return to D.D. and explore the menu
4 Stars because it was my first visit, first sanny, and first soup
Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Not to happy. I had fond memories of Dilly's and was looking forward to a long overdue return to what I once considered to be a true 5 star gem. 
Unfortunately, nothing stood out about this visit. The soup was ok but the bread bowl it's served in was dry and probably a few days old. I'm not sure how busy they are but it looked like enough bread for a few days, they  have bags and bags of bread everywhere throughout the kitchen.  The sandwich was fine, meat and veggies were fresh but the bread was very overcooked on one side , almost burnt but not quite. 

The young man who was working the front was very helpful and polite but someone needs to teach this kid some entry level sanitation skills. He was helping himself to a bowl of soup and was licking his fingers and hand. Gross.
As I walking out the door I noticed he was enjoying his soup while seated on a food prep table. Management needs to get there act together and properly train their staff and ensure that health codes are being followed.

I won't be running back to Dilly's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Dilly's. Got a chicken salad sandwich with slaw and potato salad. The only thing stopping from giving it five stars is the decrepit state of the strip shopping center it's in. The parking lot looks like Beirut. Please open another location in South Chandler."}
{"text":"Ok, I finally made it to Dilly's.  I can't say I was all that impressed.  The food was okay, the service sucked, and I don't really see what the big deal is about this place.

I grew up eating real deli food.   This, is not real deli food.  It serves a very limited selection of menu options.  For starters, you only have 3 choices of bread. I got a half sandwich and half salad.  The food was good, a notch above \"decent.\"  Good enough to eat on a regular basis becuase its near my place, but NOT deserving of a special out of the way trip.

I dunno, I wouldnt NOT reccomend this place, but, I left unimpressed.  The Greek salad was good, the sandwich was good, but I feel like I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"absolutely my favorite deli in Arizona. Love the bread bowls."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich and soup shop! My family loves coming here, mom loves the Reuben. I am a huge fan of their soul. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Big fan! 

I love me a good sammy and/or salad and they have both. They will even deliver to my office just for me. I don't think they have an order minimum. But I would recommend to order about 45 minutes ahead of when you will want to eat, they take a little while, but it's no big thang as long as you order at the right time. They are very accommodating as well, if an order isn't right or you are dissatisfied they will run over ASAP and fix it or they are happy to put a credit on your account for next time. 

My office orders from here some times as well, as long as you call them an hour in advance they will be right on time with your order. 

Their bread is awesome, their dark rye is my favorite. They have great chicken salad, I usually get their Chicken Salad Salad or the Chef salad.... their honey mustard dressing is the bomb! All their sides are yummy too, pasta salad, cottage cheese, potato salad.... and they have all kinds of chips and cookies and brownies. I also appreciate that they menu isn't huge, when a place has a billion thing on the menu its impossible to choose, they have just enough. 

Big Big fan!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Glendale to this location thanks to yelp only to get home and my order was completely screwed up and had items missing. I'll call in the morning to request a refund but in the meantime never again will I visit at this location."}
{"text":"Yelp REALLY needs to have a place where you can give ZERO stars because..

NEVER AGAIN..so it's not often that my son and I trek over to this side of town but he had a dental appt so considering it was lunch time when we were done I suggested Dilly's. Upon arriving there wasn't a big lunch rush (thankful) so I ordered a half sandwich and soup for myself and a whole sandwich for my son (both Southwest Clubs, no onion, on white - this is important so remember this) lol.

Sat down only to be told the soup I ordered was out..no problem just give me an entire sandwich. No offer to credit me the difference (a dollar and some change)..I requested a bag of chips to settle it up and the cashier agreed and that was that.

My sandwich did not have onions as requested but my son's did....he's allergic. So I told him to take it back up and tell them it has onions, they took his food..proceeded to put on gloves..take the onions off and bring him back the sandwich...I'VE NEVER SEEN A RESTAURANT DO THIS - EVER. So I tell the girl (sandwich maker) HE'S ALLERGIC..he needs a new sandwich..

She walks away and brings him another sandwich...on WHEAT, now I'm FUMING because this is YOUR mistake not mine and I'm trying my hardest to be nice about it...and NOT ONCE was there an apology made. I'm not one to make a scene in an establishment but she really pushed her luck today. So I calmly ask her \"is this wheat\" she said yes, matter of factly mind you and I say \"his sandwich was on white\" she snatches the sandwich and goes to make yet ANOTHER replacement, which she gives to me UNTOASTED, I calmly ask her if she can toast it..because NOW I'm ready to go OFF. She snatches the sandwich and throws it in the grill while messing up another customers sandwich that was toasting before barely toasting mine and giving it back to me.

At this point I would have left because I didn't even want MY sandwich anymore (which I ended up eating 2-3 bites shy of a half and left the other half there) but my son hadn't eaten anything the entire day due to his dental appt.

This place will NEVER get my business again."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for a buffalo chicken sandwich, and settled on checking out Dilly's deli after hearing a couple friends talk about how good this deli was. 
The chicken was sliced with buffalo sauce. Typically comes with ranch (SO. Wrong!) but we're happy to accommodate my request for blue cheese. I selected the focaccia bread and macaroni salad. Both selections were so-so. The focaccia was very fluffy, but for me over powered the sandwich. The macaroni salad was considered a waste of calories in my book, and threw it away after 2 bites-just nothing special-mayo, macaroni, some diced red pepper and American cheese.

Not quite what I was looking for in a buffalo chicken sandwich, but the deli has potential for other good sandwiches.

The location was less than desirable, in a 95% vacant strip mall, but the interior was very comfortable."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff are friendly, the building is always clean inside and out and the food is always just the way we order it! If you get delivery they are always here quicker than quoted! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Best bread bowl ever.  Great price,  very fresh--coming back!  Kids eat free on the Weekend (with adult meal).  Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dilly's I've been to. I came once and a fiasco with their app had me driving around and made me 30 minutes late back from lunch. But they handled it and were very nice. They gave me a gift card. 

That lunch was terrible. The Wisconsin cheddar which is typically a thick soup was the consistency of water, the bowl I poured it into started sprouting holes all over my work desk the dilly bird sandwich tasted stale. I threw the majority of a $10 meal away. But I figured I'll use the I'm sorry gift card and go again. Same exact meal. Same exact soup consistency,although it wasn't cold this time, it was warmish. The sandwich tasted Unfresh so I pitched it again. What a waste.

Now I admit to being a food snob so normally I'd blame this on that. I went so often to the one by asu but I was a college student and wasn't as picky about food then. But the thing is, I went to the one on priest and southern a week ago and it was AWESOME! I ate every bite, soup was thick, bowl for the soup didn't sprout stale leaks. I don't know what the deal is but I'll go to priest and southern next time."}
{"text":"Great food and they're so friendly!  Never disappointed here.   Bread bowls are delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in with the family today, it's been awhile since our last visit.

We ordered the Stray Kitty on White with Tuna, a brownie, and the Half Red Bird

I ate the tuna and just loved it, quite tantalizing. The wife enjoyed her red bird as well. And the brownie? Forget about it  - spectacular!! Didn't stand a chance. Ha

Only challenge was our cashier (young female) seemed put out by our questions about the menu.

I would have no hesitation recommending this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"For one sandwich it was $8, now don't get me wrong I get that airport food is overpriced but this is just ridiculous. The prices aren't even openly labeled.

The sandwich itself was not fresh, the veggies were limp and the bread crumbled into itself. I couldn't even eat half the sandwich before I was covered in bread crumbs. 

Vendors were too busy talking to each other, so I just looked around, paid and got out of there. Get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"It had been about a year since visited this sandwich place so I thought I would give it another try.  Not busy at all on a Saturday.  Ordered the club sandwich which to say the least was a mess - meats all over the place and the toppings were placed in a way where the bread was sliding all over as well.  Took about 20 minutes to get a sandwich.   Nothing about this place to warrant a return with several solid sandwich spots in the area."}
{"text":"Was encouraged to visit Dilly's due to My daughters school having Family Night. It was very busy on arrival. I ordered the Dilly's Bird & Greek salad and it was fantastic, this would definitely have me being a regular here."}
{"text":"Give me a Dilly Bird on Focaccia with potato salad and a Coke and I won't have to eat the rest of the day. Portion sizes are generous but most importantly delicious.  Haven't had a bad sandwich yet and I've tried half the menu.  Salad's are for rabbits so I won't be reviewing those but the soups are absolutely delicious. Try it if your in the neighborhood, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I lived in Arizona for a time, this was one of my favorite places to go for sandwiches.  It certainly beat Subway and Schlotzky's by a long shot.  The sandwiches are prepared fresh and the cashier's didn't mind had soda in our \"water\" cups.  Shh, don't tell them that, lol.  It was one of the few good places I ate that I do miss about Arizona.  Everything else is pretty much forgotten."}
{"text":"Well...what can you say? This is a solid hangover spot to enjoy a fresh sammie after a long night. Every time i go there i always look at the menu and see 4 different sandwiches that sound amazing and then go back to the turkey bacon avocado. The turkey is finely shaven goodness, the bacon always crisp and the bread is flat pressed and somehow still chewy. Then they put some kind of honey vinegarrette dressing that adds just a kiss of sweetness. This is your standard run of the mill sandwich shop guys this isnt exactly a date spot.
Couple negatives though, the sandwich is a bit coiny for a moderate size sandwich. We are talking in that 8-10 range which is a little agressive for what ya get. Also the side dishes are absolutley mediocre as they could be. The potato salad always looks good but then I taste it and I think they should have just saved some time and bought it from safeway because this isnt very good. The pasta salad is bland and just overall very unrefreshing. Then youve got your option to get a soup, which are good but then next thing you know your at 13 bucks and saying hell i could have gotten two footlongs at subway."}
{"text":"Even though this is my first official Yelp Check In.. i am a frequenter at Dilly's Deli. It was one of the firat lunch places i went to in Phoenix.. and i come here during work to unwind.

The cookis only .75 are crunchy and chocolatey and my favorite waiting for my order snack.

The best part of dilly\"s is how they have a small and large bread bowls for soups and you get a great price for having a meal in a combo.

My personal favorite ia their Lobster Bisque Fridays and the new 5-0 sandwhich. (Not together but.. oh they are both so good!)"}
{"text":"First time coming here... let me just say WOW!!! very impressed, they have this old time deli feel and the sandwiches are delicious. Hubby and I went on the basic route and ordered the dilly club. Mine was on sourdough his on fricatta. They are pretty big definitely filling! Got a bread bowl cream of broccoli yum wish it had more soup for the size of bread you get but eh lol. Only issue was we ordered a potato salad and a pasta salad but got two pastas.  Besides that we will definitely be coming back to try something else."}
{"text":"WOW! - Even though it took some time, Dilly's Deli made things right with me regarding the messed up order. As usual the food is the best and I appreciate the customer service, they went above and beyond. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is a nice local sandwich shop with fresh meats, breads, and all the fixings. We shared a turkey wrap with feta cheese, walnuts, spinach and dressing. You order at the counter and then they call you when your food is ready. Good service and a quick meal. It is close to ASU and easy to get in and out of."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice now and I can say this place is pretty awesome for a quick sandwich, especially compared to those chains like Subway that can get extremely old after awhile. Dilly's is reasonably priced and has fresh bread as well as Boar's Head brand meats which are always bomb!"}
{"text":"I can't even explain how good this place is. So many good choices of bread that's fresh and some combos that are to die for! BBQ sandwich is a fucking win! It's right off the 101 and Southern and is worth it for the price. You will NOT BE LET DOWN!"}
{"text":"Great place in Phoenix for a good deli sandwich. Bread is hearty and the selection of sandwiches offers delicious dressings and fixings. Sandwiches are large and can be split when the hunger isn't as strong. I haven't tried the soup bowls, but my gal swears by them. 

Southwest Club is my fav! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Thinking of Dilly's focaccia bread makes my mouth water... Seriously this place is great and Ive been here or the other one in Tempe numerous times and never had a bad meal or bad service.
Personally I love the Yahoo (on focaccia of course!) or if you want something a little lighter, go with the Southwest chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Pretty sad it's taken me almost a year to eat at this Dilly's Deli despite the walkable distance I live within the shop. It's also disappointing that they've closed other locations down, but at least this one is still open! It's in a small, unassuming building right off of University. Just like with many of those restaurants in that stretch of University, the entrance/parking comes up quickly. 

I live for their fresh sandwiches! My favorites are Yahoo! and the Southwest Club, but most favorite is the Southwest Club on multi-grain. It's got some weird/funky fixins on the sandwich but makes for delicious bites. The most recent time I visited I [duh] ordered the Southwest Club + pasta salad. Normally for a side I'll get a side salad or chips but I wanted to mix things up, and the counter guy suggested pasta salad. Didn't end up being the greatest choice [lot of pasta, not a lot of other things + flavor], but live and learn. This location also has a Coke Freestyle machine! 

I highly recommend grabbing a table outside since it's got great views of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Can't say a single bad thing about this place. First of all it was the best customer service I've had in a long time. I think they bake their own bread & it's amazing. The meat was delicious & the veggies were fresh. 
Glad I work right down the street so I can eat here often."}
{"text":"I love Dilly's Deli.I usually order the broccoli and cheddar soup bread bowl, while my husband prefers the sandwiches. The staff is always friendly when we go there for lunch."}
{"text":"Dilly's Deli is the perfect place to get a quick bite. I love their half soup and sandwich combos. When you enter the restaurant the workers are punching dough and the bread is always fresh. 

This location on University has tight parking area and the seating inside is also small. When waiting for your food almost at every turn you feel like your bumping into someone. Otherwise, the food is very fresh amd sandwiches are packed with yummy meats. 

My favorite thing to order is the southwest club in sandwich or wrap form  depending on what  I'm feeling. I always get the classic clam chowder in the bread bowl. It's  a comforting bowl of soup and it's  always fun to devour the whole bowl and dip the bread in the soup
 
The food is good but I had to take  a star off for the whole experience. I came during a busy time, my cashier kept mumbling and I could barely hear what he was saying. I know it's  busy but he could step it up with service. He also forgot to offer  me a water cup.

When I asked for suggestions  he just shrugged. Also, the ovens are going all the time they need to turn down the AC. Overall, I would come back hopefully  during  a time they are less busy and able to attend to everyone."}
{"text":"Very good deli. Fresh ingredients and good sandwiches. I would recommend the Dilly Bird, Smokey Mountain and the South West Club."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and good fresh bread.

The people are nice.

The only downside is the amount of meat use could be a bit better."}
{"text":"Always one of the top sammich spots. The soup bread bowls are killer.. Only had the boston clam chowder though..

Fresh meats n bread on sammiches, just the right mix of portions..

Only issue is more menu variations, but pretty sure you can order anything that they have ingredients for.. Might ask them to spin up a cuban next time."}
{"text":"Always great sandwiches. The dudes on register could do with a bit less complete boredom on their faces but the managers are on top of things. It's super clean and they have classic sandwich options plus a few original ones. They're big but kinda pricey sandwiches too. Not a bad thing necessarily but if you're broke, go to subway or Cheba Hut honestly."}
{"text":"Great food but the staff is awful. The guy at the checkout was in a big hurry and I had no one behind me. After I asked what the rush was, he said that I was taking too long. They have a great menu and I wanted to try everything so I was looking the menu over. I said that I wasn't ready yet and he did a frustrated exhale and and shook his head NO as he looked down. 
I walked out and I will NEVER eat at a Dilly's again."}
{"text":"absolutely wonderfully delicioouuss!!! Dilly's Deli has a very large variety in the ingredients they offer which of course led me to taking forever to put together my order( but I was creating a masterpiece here) but after I finally got it together it was freaking delicious and hit every craving I was having. I got a turkey wrap with feta, cranberries, spinach, candid walnut, avocado and even raspberry vinaigrette on the side. I know it might not sound as delicious to you as it does to me but you get the idea of the creations you can put together here.

Lover got a meat lovers sandwich and all of their soups come in a bread bowl. He tried the potato soup and had nothing negative to say about his order. Along with soup they have chips and other pasta salads you can get on this side as well. 

Food smelled so dang good, I couldn't help devour the only thing i could get my hands on while I was driving which was the huge delicious pickle that came with the meal :)"}
{"text":"My colleague put in an order for lunch and I decided to order with her. When the order arrived, I received the wrong item and my colleague didn't receive the chips that came with her basket. We called back and asked for them to correct the order. We were given no apology, just a \"well I don't know when the driver is going to be able to come back\". When they did come back, my correct order was drenched in salad dressing, so much that it was coming out of both the packaging it was wrapped in as well as the carry-out bag. It was inedible. Furthermore, my colleague's chips were completely smashed (there was a hole in the bag like someone had popped it and when she opened it the chips were nothing but crumbs). It almost seems like it was all done on purpose. First and last time I'll be eating Dilly's Deli."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!! I love Dilly's and just about everything on their menu. Some of my favorites are the Yahoo, Southwest Wrap, Sweet Leaf Turkey Wrap, Sweet Leaf Salad with Chicken, Blazin' Buffalo, Smokey Mountain, The Gobbler or any of their amazing hearty soups in a bread bowl! YUM! See I told you I love the whole menu!! I think I fell in love with Dilly's the first time I tried it! I'm lucky there has always a Dilly's location close to me. One of Arizona's local gems, in my opinion. Believe me, if you are having lunch with a friend and you don't know where to go, just go to Dilly's! They are pretty packed at lunch time for this reason, but I think they also allow call ahead or to-go orders. 

Oh yeah, I'm obsessed with their Focaccia bread. That is all."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Don't get delivery unless you have no other option- just go pick it up, they get super busy at lunch. If you ask for no onions you are probably still getting onions. They have awesome soups, but they tend to run out of the best ones after lunch. One of my favorite places to go for sandwiches in Tempe! (They have other locations, too!)"}
{"text":"Just one of those places you can get something quick and is way better than a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Long time customer to this location and have always enjoyed my visits. The sandwiches are all tasty and well made and the soups are just as good. The ingredients seem much higher than other sandwich shops and the combos they offer provide tons of great options. They've been in the same location for years now even though the shopping center they are located in has become a ghost town, the place is always busy during lunch times, which is another great indication of how well they're doing. Definitely a local favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Actually this place is worth trying out....the sandwiches on foccacia bread was great. During work week it does get a little busy at lunch. I would try this place again...G approved."}
{"text":"Went here for a light lunch and found it to be a nice, classic diner near ASU's Tempe campus. The parking lot was the first perk to this place, as not a lot of places near campus can boast of free parking. 

I had a small Greek salad, which came with a slice of toast. It filled me up and tasted really fresh! My friend got a soup bread bowl that looked really cozy and tasty. 

The staff was extra friendly and the overall vibe was very easy-going. I would come back! :)"}
{"text":"I need to get myself over to Dilly's Deli soon- I have not been in awhile.  I really liked the potato soup in the bread bowl--- wow!  SO good.  So am craving it now.  

The lunch line would get really long though, if you can avoid the lunch rush, I would and go at an off-beat hour instead.

The bread is all really good here and the prices were good too."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pretty decent. 
I really enjoyed the blazin buffalo. I would recommend not getting it on the foccacia though. I'd never had that bread so I decided to get it, and it was good. Super soft, but not right for the sandwich, since it has so much sauce. 
My boyfriend got the smokey mountain. He really dug it. The meat on the inside of the sandwiches are cold, but the bread is toasted.

The soup was good. I got the cream of broccoli, which was good. He got the cream of potato, which would have been better if it was hot.

Over all pretty good. The dudes weren't unpleasant, but not super friendly. It didn't turn us off from the place at all though.

Probably gonna pick this place over some better known sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch on my way out of town. They have decent and mildly creative sandwiches.....don't bother if you love crazy flavors or variety. More for a bland palate. 
At lunch Dilly's was semi crowded with business people but the line moved fast. I had the monthly special \"The Smokestack\" (December)  with roast beef and turkey. I also got a bread bowl of cream of potato soup. I wasn't able to finish half a sandwich and a bread bowl of soup  (for $8 total). It was a very good amount of food for the money, made fresh. 

The bread for the bread bowl is white bread, so don't go getting all sourdough amped up. Overall satisfying, but unremarkable. It's convenient, fast and pretty good quality. A nice little deli with average service is a fine addition to the main road."}
{"text":"Dilly's features great, fresh sandwiches, salads and sides, served in generous portions, on a great variety of fresh breads.  The staff is always super-friendly and the joint is packed at lunch time, despite being in an otherwise almost completely dead strip mall that isn't doing anything to help draw in new blood.  Tip: go for the half sandwich and side or salad deal.  The \"half\" sandwich is much closer to a \"full\" sandwich, and it's a great value.  Part of the regular lunch rotation with the office gang.  Good stuff, Maynard!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches west of the Mississippi!  The salads are good too, as are the fresh baked goods (i.e. cookies.)  I've seen a lot of friends slurp down and devour the soup in bread bowls too, so I imagine they are most excellent.  My only qualm with the place is the strange smell.  Whenever I do lunch there, I leave smelling like a french fry, even though they don't fry anything there.  What gives?  Still, despite this annoyance, I keep coming back for more delicious food."}
{"text":"Went to lunch Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The music was too loud and all the booth tables were occupied or dirty. I'm sure the workers would have rather been else where. However, they still have the best Boston Clam Chowder and the featured sandwich of the month \"Club West\" was really tasty."}
{"text":"LARGE sandwiches. Delicious wheat bread. Try the tuna salad sandwich. If you're not real hungry, be sure and order just half. By all means, when asked about condiments, ask for the Russian mustard--tasty!"}
{"text":"A must try! Great sandwiches - soups - and salads! Everything taste fresh and homemade. I especially love the bread and balsamic salad dressing! Once you try Dillys, you will never go to a chain sandwich shop again. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sandwiches have less meat than they used to."}
{"text":"One of the better sandwiches in Tempe. I've tried a good amount of their menu and loved everything I tasted. They have a promotion after ASU game days where they give you a discount based on how many points the Sun Devils score (they had 54 on Colorado last night so it's 54% off today). Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Wanted something different for lunch, went to Yelp and bam!  Rhonda had just put in a review for a place 5 minutes away.  It was fate!

Dilly's Deli was easy to fine, had lots of parking and a great mix of student and business customers.  As if the bucket of Dr. Brown's Soda wasn't enough to make me like it, \"Looking for love in all the wrong places\" was playing. (Followed by Van Halen's Animal. Interesting transition...)  

Menu is simple, sandwiches, wraps, salads and soup, and combos available for any 2 of those things.  I noticed they use Boars Head meat, which is nice. I got a 1/2 sandwich small soup - which actually less than a full sandwich at $6.29.  The sandwich was on a soft Italian style bread, cut at an angle.  Made for a better sandwich than I thought as it was toasted just a bit, but oh so soft on the inside.  The chicken salad was great.   And the small soup they gave came in a bread bowl - SO awesome.  It wasn't sourdough as I'd hoped, but it was a nice white.  That Wisconsin cheddar soup was way too yummy.  It felt more like bread dip.  And since I got mine to go, I got the whole loaf w/ soup on the side so I could create it myself once it was ready to be eaten.

The place is cute with nice outdoor and indoor seating.  Definitely a new regular spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad here. The service only suffers a little during the lunch rush but both times I had bad service on the phone, the manager personally delivered my order with his appologies and a coupon/discount off my next order.That's what keeps people coming back to your place. (Owners-write that down) Their food is delish! And I am always mixing up my sandwiches, changing breads,toppings, etc. They've served up to 10 people in my party before and still got all of our orders correct! Their sandwiches are very different and imaginative. And did I mention delicious?? The Irish girl in me loves the Corned Beef sandwich! Mmm! Getting hungry! I know where I am going for lunch tomorrow! Oh! Treat yourself to the cookie for goodness sake! You deserve it!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Great food.  My friend picks up a meal for me sometimes because it is very far from me.  I get the one with bacon and avocado, I forget the name of it."}
{"text":"The food looked fresh, I'll give it that. A small little spot among the restaurants in the \"A\" wing. There are some better prices around on things, but they have water, soda, chips, salads, and sandwiches. Really that's it. There is a small island with the salads and sandwiches, drinks on the wall behind and you are done. If you have more time invest your money in a restaurant near by. The food looks good, but not for the price. A simple wrap is 7.99, that's a meal near by."}
{"text":"I am a Midwest transplant who loves her corned beef! They have really mastered it out east! I was craving a solid roast beef sandwich for a while since moving here 2 months ago and I work near Dilly's. I decided to quiet the craving and give Dilly's a try. I hate to say it but I was so disappointed. I think the photo really speaks for itself. Either the person who made the sandwich was in a hurry or they are cutting back on the ounces of corned beef portions for the sandwiches!! But corned beef sandwiches are normally supposed to tower in between slices of bread and be practically tipping over on its side! I am sad to say it was not a winning sandwich, my craving was not satisfied, and I'm back to trying to find a real corned beef sandwich! I will say, the employees there are super nice! The restaurant is very clean!"}
{"text":"I asked for a sandwich with extra mustard and got a sandwich with which the bread was literally soaked in a syrupy substance. If that's what the \"mustard\" is, do not sell it as a mustard. The sandwich is totally inedible. Waste of money. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"never again...ordered a tuna melt sandwich a bag of chips and a small soup for delivery $16 dlls plus tip later....the sandwich was cold a slab of cheese thats not melted yuck and the money down the drain ...when i called they said thats how it comes ...what a joke"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Maybe 3.5 versus a 3.  

I ordered a full and a half sandwich for 2 folks.  Frankly two half sandwiches would have been plenty.

The big critique of this place (and I've been to two different ones) is that there's an awful lot of bread on these sandwiches.  I'm thinking ats why two half sandwiches would go pretty far for two people."}
{"text":"Had the potential of being a \"hidden gem\" given its strange location in an unfrequented plaza right off the highway. Unfortunately, the young man at the checkout counter was so unfriendly, impatient, and bro-ish. Him and the other three male workers were literally standing around but not at all eager to explain the ordering process or answer any questions. What made it worse? I was literally the ONLY customer in the entire store! Take a little pride in your job. Geesh! Definitely wasn't a pleasant or welcoming experience. Too bad because my sandwich was actually decent."}
{"text":"i go to Dilly's whenever i have the urge to slip into a carb coma because the portions are HUGE. we're talking one sandwich cut in half looks more like two full sandwiches.

i always build my own to load up on the veggies (gotta pretend like i'm being healthy). the best thing is, you could request everything but the kitchen sink in your sandwich and the price never changes. in fact, you could probably request they throw in the kitchen sink, and the price would remain the same. it seems to be one of the only places that doesn't charge a premium for avocado.

for people who like punch cards, Dilly's has one. as far as atmosphere, don't expect any. it gets crowded here during lunch and the service is not always friendly but always fast. it's a great place to go if you feel like wolfing down a gigantic sandwich before passing out at your desk."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Dilly's Deli for years.

Here's why I don't like them anymore:

1.) they no longer use Boar's Head brand meats.

As most everyone knows, BH meats are one of the highest quality meats.  Whatever new supplier they are using is not nearly as good.  I asked an employee why they changed suppliers and they said BH is too expensive.  I am sorry, but you did not lower your prices.  BH is much better quality than whatever crap they're using.

2.) I found out the secret to their delicious \"homemade\" creamy chicken noodle soup.

Apparently Dilly's simply uses a frozen chicken noodle soup (I believe the employee said it was Sysco) that they just add heavy cream to.

Yes, their creamy chicken noodle soup is delicious; However, I think I can manage to just make my own rather than pay $5 for not-even-close to homemade stuff.

3.) Most of their employees just don't care about the customer.  

You will see what I mean when you show up to Dilly's within 45 minutes - an hour of closing time.  On the last two visits, I have heard employees say they were not going to make any new soup because they just wanted to start cleaning up.  On one visit, they only had ONE soup left and instead of telling the customer that... they just waited until she named every other soup and told her they were out.  WHAT?!

Dilly's needs to step up their game again or they will lose my business for good.

3 stars for the creamy chicken noodle soup alone.  Even though it isn't homemade, it is still delicious in that bread bowl."}
{"text":"Very good, quality food. Soup in a bread bowl yum. We will be back over and over and over again"}
