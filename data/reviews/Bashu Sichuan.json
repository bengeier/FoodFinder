{"text":"We love Ba Shu!  It's always delicious and fresh. If there is a line-up, don't worry its a large restaurant and tables become available quickly. It's a must when in Mississauga."}
{"text":"It's just too slow!! I am wondering they only one chef to serve more than twenty tables!! We have been there and wait for almost 1 hour to get only one dish and then continue to wait! It looks every one is just wondering that is their dish when the man came out with the food. Okay. The only promising is food is not bad as their service."}
{"text":"Long waits for a table during peak times but food is amazing. Large portions and the best spicy, sliced beef I've had from any Sichuan place, including ones in Markham and Toronto. We also had bowls of Dan Dan noodles, which were huge and very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Your food can be amazing but after the second time the service was even worst than the first time. The final straw for us was when we sat for 25 mins, their waitresses heads were down the whole time so they dont look around. Finally we flagged someone down, they took our ipad, and....nothing. After 25 mins, i went up to them and told them to cancel our order. Their excuse was they didnt see our table....but that wouldnt happen if anyone looked up and what happened to the waitress before? Service was so poor, we wont be back."}
{"text":"I like the fact that you could order with an ipad, and I like that they serve green tea with your  meal. That's about all I liked though.  This was my first visit to an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant and perhaps I'm just not accustomed to the cuisine. The sweet and sour fish was absolutely disgusting. It was sickeningly sweet and the fish texture was off. The restaurant service wasn't all that great either, and the place had a weird smell."}
{"text":"Really good, authentic Sichuan food, however it is extremely spicy, so not for the weak of heart"}
{"text":"Food was 20 minutes late, service sucked. We got the most bland fried rice in history and the pork chops were super tough and chewy. I've been to some low quality Chinese food places but this is by far the worst I've ever experienced. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food in Toronto. Authentic Sichuan food.   Slow service after initial order.   Nice decor and clean.   Not a budget place. No credit card"}
{"text":"Food and customer service both were worst!! Waste of money!!! Servers are always busy..you have to look for them by yourself. No one is listening to you. Foods are very much pricy than it's quality. You have to wait long time for food. Overall this place is a mess. Very bad management."}
{"text":"It is authentic Sichuan flavour.  I highly recommend spicy fried chicken, always my favourite. Only one thing, it is too spicy....it may be authentic but it's also authentically spicy. Can't handle here given the dry weather."}
{"text":"Bomb. No time for specifics, just delicious. Best Sichuan around. Food is delicious and extremely traditional. Top notch flavours, spices, food and service are all remarkable"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place but my experiences have been unsatisfactory the last few times I came here. The servers hand you a sheet of paper write down your orders - which is fine, except they pretty much ignore you the entire time you're there. The food is mediocre and so unbelievably greasy you might as well have swallowed a bucket of oil."}
{"text":"Some dishes are good but some are not. 3 stars for everything including their pork rib with cumin sauce ( really tasty). As expected their service is slow and unprofessional. Last time I had to refill my own tea and get napkins/take out containers by myself since they were so busy."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch and ordered off the regular menu.  Flavor was decent but dishes were incredibly incredibly greasy.  Dishes were also not spicy enough (got the cumin lamb, as well as a spicy chicken dish).  I'm sure the cheaper lunch special might be worth the price, but for the $17/dish we paid, it was a huge disappointment.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Food was good but I found an order ticket in my tofu and seafood soup.  Should check the food first before eating..."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. It's very authentic Sichuan food and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves spices and some heat."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant while in Mississauga, didn't have very high expectations as the review indicated slow service etc. I have to say, the food came out very quickly even with a full house, the flavour is authentic and service improved based on the other reviews. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"If you like spicy food (the kind that numbs your mouth) this is the place for you.   We ordered the tofu in hot pot  and beef slice & tripe in chili oil.  The Sichuan cuisine is pretty authentic but quite oily and the portions were much bigger than we anticipated.  However, the non Sichuan menu items that we got like the dumpling with noodles were just average.  The service at this place definitely needs some work. When we walked in, it was clear that the one of the waitresses saw us but did not come over to seat us until 5 minutes later even though there was an empty table.  You order your dishes through an iPad here, but it took a long time for them to come take the iPad & put in our order."}
{"text":"Thick plastic cups for beers with strong smell of bleach. Poor services and terrible food . Wouldn't come back again for sure ."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to go for dinner and she said there's a place for Chinese food that's a lot like home back in China. I sighed... I'm tired of eating more Chinese food. Total overload. I was surprised when we arrived. I have eaten here once before, but hadn't come by for quite some time.  The place was packed and there was a line up. The staff was busy, but they were somewhat efficient. You did need to get their attention when walking in and I saw a table or two that diners had finished, but were still not cleaned - at least until someone waiting in line went to the waitress and told them to start cleaning it up for them to sit down. I think based on how busy it was; it's an overworked factor.  They utilize an ipad menu and call system. The only problem was the lack of English. You need to go by pictures. I probably could have asked the staff for help, but it seems they're predominantly Mandarin speaking and fortunately, my friend is fluent in Mandarin.  Unfortunately, this means I can't tell you if English menu ordering is available.  I think the Sichuan style (aside from being spicy) is meant to have a lot of oil/greasiness. A bowl or two of rice is a must when you eat here.  The first dish we received was the green onion pancake. I saw it was glistening with oil. If I was with my parents I would have asked for napkins to soak up the oil. The pancake was made the way I like it; flat like a pancake, not like some other places where it is made into a bun.   When ordering I recognized a certain dish, but have no idea what it's called except that it is a spicy cold beef appetizer and I couldn't stop eating it. The beef was cubed and slightly chewy, probably softened quite a bit from braising. Even before you see the layer of chili oil pooled at the bottom of the tiny dish you could tell it was definitely infused with spices. I didn't care. My friend fortunately found it to be too spicy so I ate most of it.  Sichuan style MaPo tofu is very flavorful and of course uses Sichuan Peppercorns. After downing a couple bowls I had to tap out because of an overload of black beans (they're really salty black coloured beans used in cooking for flavouring).  There was a sliced pork belly dish as well - same deal with the black bean overload; and a layer of oil, which I seriously doubt was vegetable/cooking oil, pooled at the bottom.  I'm trying to down a lot of water to flush out the salt and also paid for the spiciness today.  I'm going to go back soon or order take out. I saw on the website they have Gongbao Chicken (thinking it's \"Mandarin-nese\" english for Kung Pao Chicken). I need to find out if it's good there.... and I need to get that beef dish again. I NEED TO.  3 Stars because if people ate like this every day it's going to be an early heart attack."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service and restaurant management I have ever experienced!  I don't expect the best service when I go to Chinese restaurants but this place is unbelievably bad. And it's a shame too because the decor and food is on point! If they got better servers, a host, and organized their reservations/seating chart then they would have 5 stars. It's almost impossible trying to get the attention of a server. Expect to wait around 10 minutes before someone finally notices you waiting to be seated. The annoying thing is, even though it's busy, the servers still move sooooo slowly! Judging by the other reviews, this bad service is a known problem and yet the restaurant doesn't put more servers on or hire better ones. Step your game up!"}
{"text":"We grab food here about once a week It is a slow grab  Food is quite good but service is horrific Slow is the new normal here My first take is that they are short staffed-which I believe they are- yet busy or not the service is still quite poor,slow and inattentive  I would give 4 solid stars on the food Service is one or two stars"}
{"text":"This is the spot to get your Sichuan spicy food fix. The flavours are bold and authentic. You can order using an iPad. The only downside is that it is hard to wave down a server since they tend to be very busy. Although I like to dine in, I commonly get take out because the wait is less."}
{"text":"Dishes were tasty and rarely had been disappointing. But it is very interesting that the restaurant seemed to be allllways busy and lack of servants. Usually takes time to be seated and serve"}
{"text":"The place was very busy, however we manage to get a table after waiting for 15minutes. After we order our food we waited for half an hour per dish. The food was not very good. After waiting for an hour and our second dish we left and paid what we ate. The worst part their were table before us that got all there food before ours and was halfway finished.   If the place is busy for anyone to come here and eat dont bother you finish your food 3 hours later atleast.   If was possible i would have given them 0 stars"}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that offers decent food (though not amazing by any means) for big portions and is relatively inexpensive. As typical of Sichuan cuisine, it is on the oily/greasy side and although not all dishes are spicy, if it is listed as spicy, it is not the mild kind - so come with the right expectations.    Tried: Sesame beef rolls - Flavour and texture was kinda bland, so was disappointed Shanghainese fried noodles - Okay, but nothing to rave home about Spicy eggplant with garlic - This can be a tad spicy for people who are not used to 'spicy', but was my favourite dish as it was quite flavorful Curry Noodles (Ho Fan) - This was the highlight for everyone; portions were good given the price and the spice was spot on.  It docks 2 major stars due to nearly nonexistent service - it is hard to flag down a wait staff and the food comes EXTREMELY slow - like snail pace slow. We waited between 1-1.5 hours from the time we ordered (which is done on an iPad so I mean, it's not like the order was left hanging) to the food actually coming, 3 hours total spent for lunch. Do NOT go hungry or pressed for time. The place is fairly busy and packed, but it still takes forever for the staff to do much of anything. There were many tables not cleaned up despite patrons leaving way earlier!  Not a bad place for some solid Sichuan food, but go at your own discretion, depending on your tolerance for time, meh service, and spiciness."}
{"text":"I've been there a numerous number of times and I think it's pretty good overall, I really like the food there and the service isn't bad, its pretty Chinese, not like American Chinese, its really worth a try, definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"A Caucasian friend told me to check this place out.  I didn't want to believe him at first but he is right.  This place is VERY GOOD.    I love how I can use ipad to see the images and order.  You can switch between Mandrian or English.   You get BIG portion for the money you pay.  Their signature Mapo Tofu is spicy with big portion (definitely take home portion for one person).  We ordered Stir Fried Lamb with Onion ($14?) because one of my friend doesn't like spicy food.  Man, their Lamb is soooooooooooooooo good.  Juicy, tender and you don't taste that \"lamb smell\" at all.  I went back to Bashu again today to order the same dish.    I also ordered their Beef Stew noodle.  Oh my god, HUGE portion.  It is definitely for two people and it's like under $10.    They have a lunch menu which I didn't see until I ordered.  I will check out their lunch next time.  Under $8.    Their only downside is that the servants don't seem to speak good English and because they rely on ipad ordering, the service can be slow if you need server.    For the price and quality and taste, it is definitely a 5 Star."}
{"text":"I'm not really big on spicy Sichuan cuisine, but this restaurant was surprisingly good. Service could really be a bit better, but considering that this is a Chinese restaurant and we went in during the weekend, I'll just let that slide.   When we got there, there was already a line up, but we had a reservation, so no biggie. After waiting at the door for a few minutes, I basically realized that no one is going to show me to my table, so I basically just walked right up to the cashier and told her which table I should take.    We picked out our dishes via iPad (seems like a lot of places are starting to do this) and food came reasonably fast. We ordered a three cold dish combo to start, and they were surprisingly good, but the one complaint I have is that a lot of our dishes were basically flavoured with spicy oil so, as other Yelpers pointed out, the food was pretty much swimming in oil.    Overall, the food was authentic, but can be rather greasy. The dining experience, well, just imagine yourself in a bustling Chinese market and you're there. Maybe it's just me (I like my dining experience be quiet and subdued), but when I have to practically shout so that the person across the table can hear me, that's just too loud in my books. Perhaps I'm just not Chinese enough, my Chinese companions from China all said this is pretty much how things are back home, so I suppose they are more used to it than I am. All in all, a pretty authentic Chinese/Sichuan experience, though I likely won't go back again on purpose unless invited by others."}
{"text":"Great place to dine, extensive menu. Offers great variety of noodles, fried rice, meat, seafood dishes!"}
{"text":"Food was good (very spicy but with lots of chili oil and spices) and plates arrived quickly. However, main complaints are that they were initially too busy to seat us (though in all fairness, we came in Father's Day) and that they charge an obscenely high price for plain white rice and bread rolls - basically, a premium is charged for anything that acts to balance/counter the spiciness. Next time, we're ordering takeout and cooking our own white rice!"}
{"text":"This is the best Sichuan restaurant in the Greater Toronto Area. The menu is extensive and the food is fantastic. It`s not your usual Sichuan food quickly prepared in a wok. The chef is from Beijing from a well known restaurant. I have not had flavours like this since I visited China. The prices are very reasonable and the service is good. I live downtown but its worth the drive.I was at the Scarborough location (recently renovated) not far from Pacific Mall at 4771 Steeles  Ave. E"}
{"text":"Large portions always have take out left over. I would recommend the spicy beef vermicelli and their fried rice. I love spice !!! Some like it hot ;)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Yes their food is good, but you will have to wait so long just to be seated when there are lots of tables available. The waiters there are rude and inattentive. Don't recommend coming here unless you're willing to wait and be served poorly."}
{"text":"I LIKE Bashu. I find the food delicious and authentic. I DON'T like dirty tables, which is what I saw when I went there - 4 tables that were just covered in food and dirty dishes that they hadn't gotten around to clearing even though the restaurant wasn't extremely busy. Sure, no one was waiting to be seated at those tables, but still - they remained dirty from when we entered to when we left.   So, that aside, the food at Bashu is yum. The menu is confusing, though I appreciate their attempt at going all high-tech and having people browse and order on iPads (finding how to switch the menu from Chinese to English is an adventure all on its own!). They have good lunch combos too - which come with a hot and sour soup.   The plaza is currently undergoing renovations, but it should be all spiffy in no time, so I look forward to another visit. Hopefully with cleaner tables."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chinese food in general, but what I struggle with is the spiciness - specifically, at most places, no matter how many times I tell them that I want it extra-spicy, I'm usually underwhelmed at the heat level.  This place DOES NOT DISAPPOINT."}
{"text":"In short - food is very good but swimming in oil (as expected for Sichuan) - service is rushed - they need more servers - got here at 5:30.  At 6:20 there was a long line - iPad ordering seems pretty gimmicky.  They should allow customers to download their own app so each person has a menu  But overall very good and very popular"}
{"text":"It is always packed here, so if you plan to go please reserve. But the food is really good! My favourite dish is lamb with cumin seeds yum! They have nice decors but it gets really loud here, so if you are looking for somewhere to relax and have no noise, don't go. They have another branch in Scarborough too, I've been there, and I would say the Mississauga one is way better"}
{"text":"Damn good Sichuan.   Keep in mind that this is not regular Chinese food you normally see here in Mississauga.  Be prepared you crap fire cause it is SPICY.  Price is a little higher than the average Chinese food.  Food wait times can be lengthy and service is mediocre but everyone comes for mainly the food.  4/5"}
{"text":"Average across the board, a bit pricey for average though. Authentic food but service was not too friendly however efficient. Would recommend for those cold winter nights to warm up. Worth a try on lazy evenings when the group becomes indecisive of food choices..."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered take out and found peanuts in our dish even when we emphasized that we had peanut allergy and server reassured that they won't add any peanuts."}
{"text":"Shockingly good quality, really authentic, good price with large portions. If you like Szechuan you'll like this!"}
{"text":"NOTE: They accept debit and cash only, so make sure you came prepared.  Overall, this place is good.  My family and I walked in, and waited 3 minutes before we were seated. It was mildly crowded, so we were seated quite quickly (We were here on Saturday). It was a sort of big restaurant.   Ordering was simple. They get be you an iPad, and you order from there. You could also give feedback via the iPad. Ordered something wrong by accident? Don't worry! Just remove it from your list! You can also change the quantity of the food item.  Ordering from an iPad was way better than a hand written order, as it also shows an image of the food.  If you don't speak Mandarin, click the globe at the top at select your language.  Once you've finished ordering, the iPad has an option where you can call for the waiter/waitress. Once they arrived, they'll take the iPad away.  One food was delivered quite quickly. It was deliver in 5 minutes. Quite quick, compared to other restaurants.   Food Items (That we ordered), and their review:  1. Cold Rice Noodle: Okay. It is spicy, so if you have kids, probably should have them eat this. It is called Cold for a reason.  2. Fried Tofu: Good. It is hot, but delicious! I do recommend ordering this, but be sure to wait for it to cool down first. Be sure not to hurt yourself! :)  3. Chili Oil Wonton: I didn't try this because it was REALLY spicy, but from what I heard from my family, it was good. It is hard, but there is sesame on the oil.  4. Sweet & Sour Chicken: Like other restaurants, it's not the chicken that's sour, but the sauce. When it was delivered to us, it was warm, so not too hot, but at the same time, not too cold.  5. Stirred Fried Spicy Frog: It was okay. It is spicy, like the Chili Oil Wonton.  6. Mongolia Beef: Delicious! 10/10 recommended. The soft beef with the sauce is GREAT!  7. Noodle: I don't remember what type of noodle this is, but I didn't try it. I don't remember what my family members said, so I can't really give a review.  Well, that was it! Again, this was a great restaurant! I recommend you going here!"}
{"text":"Bashu is a Sichuan restaurant located in Mississauga in a plaza at the corner of Hurontario and Eglinton Ave. It's considered one of the best restaurants in the city that specializes in Sichuan style Chinese food. Sichuan food is known for being very spicy with the use of Sichuan peppercorns and lots of red chilies.  I have been to this restaurant quite a few times in the past year and we went on a recent Sunday afternoon and got seated pretty quickly. If you go there around dinner time, the place is a mad house, usually not enough staff and they don't seem to have a good system of seating people. This is probably the worse thing about eating at Bashu but the food is authentic and pretty good.  Bashu uses iPad technology for customers to order, really great idea especially if you can't read Chinese. The iPad shows the picture and price of the dish, you enter the quantity of each item you want to order and hit finish, then give a waiter/waitresses the iPad.  We ordered the stir fried diced chicken with chili ($14.50 plus tax), snowpea shoots with mixed mushrooms ($14.50 plus tax), mixed beef with hot sauce ($11.25 plus tax) and two steam rice ($1.75 each plus tax). The stir fried diced chicken, perfectly cooked and tender with a good amount of heat due to the red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. The snowpea shoots with mixed mushrooms, really good flavour and nice wok hay that you would find in a good Canton restaurant. My favourite dish at this restaurant is the mixed beef with hot sauce ($11.25 plus tax) also known as fuqi feipian, Bashu probably does the best version of this dish in the city. It's essentially beef, oxtripe, peanuts soaked in a chili oil. Nice tender beef which you would soak in the chili oil and a really good authentic spicy flavour.  If you are looking for really good authentic Sichuan food at a reasonable price in a nice modern decor then you should definitely try out Bashu. Service is just average and it can be a mad house around dinner time but it's very busy for a reason and very popular with the mainland Chinese community."}
{"text":"This place is never on the top of my list to go because is previous slow service experience. My twin requested this for our bday lunch so i obliged.   We ordered the cold spicy noodles app which was tongue numbing and delicious. We all spilt the generous portion!  My sister had the spicy fish noodle which they accommodated for instead of beef. We also polished it of together and really enjoyed the spice and flavors. The portion size was huge as well.   My partner's meal of chicken and rice wrapped in a leaf and steamed didnt come until we asked at the end of our meal... my sister and partner spit out the bites they took. There was a horrible taste they couldnt put their finger on but linked it to bad chicken. It was left untouched after that. It was on the lunch special menu so we just attributed it to day old food.   All in all decent meal depending what you order. They do ipad ordering now which is good because language barrier was an issues in previous visits."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Sichuan restaurants in Toronto. Really authentic  looking Chinese restaurant with dishes that live up to the Sichuan name - they are spicy and very tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We didn't feel like cooking on a Thursday night so my fiancé and I went to Bashu Sichuan restaurant for dinner.  The restaurant was spacious had simple decorations.  Bashu is also the first Chinese order in restaurants that I visited which uses tablet food ordering technology.  The tablet had both its advantages and disadvantages.  The disadvantage was that there is very little interaction with the restaurant staff.  The advantage is there were pictures for every item on the menu and you can see exactly what you are ordering.  Since there are large varieties of Chinese dishes, I thought it was a positive experience to see the photo of the dishes I wanted.  For our dinner.  We ordered one dish of fried noodles, a shrimp dish with mushrooms, and one dish of pork mushu wraps.  The noodles came first.  The portions were large and it was tasty.  Next came the shrimp dish with mushrooms.  There was an average number of shrimps in the dish and it was good, but not memorable.  Last came the pork wraps and they were easily my favorite!  It was a large plate of stir fry pork with lots of variety of vegetables, along with 6 pieces of thin wraps served on the side.  The wraps were so good!  In a short time I had made and eaten 3 wraps.  We were able to order more wraps for $0.50 per wrap.  The portions were large and we were able to bring the leftovers home for a second meal.  Overall it was a positive experience and I would visit Bashu again. 4.2 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This is the go-to restaurant for my family and we come here every single time I'm back in Mississauga for a visit from out of town. Decent northern Chinese cuisine that is authentic but also inviting for non-Chinese friends too. You can drive to Markham for good northern Chinese food but sometimes that's just too far.  Atmosphere: modern decor that shows off Chinese culture through the photos. You order through a n iPad which is so much easier than the written menu because each item is attached to a picture so you know exactly what you're getting. There are also some private rooms for group events as well as booth seats for two, so it's good for all occasions. They recently changed the front sign to black which is a strange restaurant presentation, but it is to match with the rest of the plaza.  Food: Many spicy dishes, but we always pick the milder ones. The food is decent portioning and we always leave with plenty left overs.  Some of our favourites: Beef pancakes5/5- Even compared to Chinese restaurants in Richmond, BC, we preferred this location. Plenty of sliced beef and sauce! 3 variety appetizers4/5- good mix of spicy cold appetizers. the last time I was here, they were low on the jellyfish.. but still a good classic when you're here with more than 3 people. There is a larger 5 variety appetizers for a bigger group.  Other 3/5 ones: sweet sour chicken - crispy and well coated. they don't cheat on the amount of meat. Beijing beef wraps - this used to be good but each time we order it, the quality varies. Most recently, it came with a lot of meat but was missing the sauce and more greens.. Cumin lamb- cumin + lamb is one of my favourite meat and spice combination (especially in skewer form!). So simple yet tasty. This used to be good but in the most recent visit, the meat was way too oily.  Service: the iPad menu makes ordering so easy, and the server comes to you at the touch of a button. the room is designed so that it is easy to see the main desk from most of the seats so getting the staff's attention is not troublesome.  Overall I enjoy my visits to this restaurant, but in the recent visits, the food quality has been inconsistent."}
{"text":"I thought this place had great food, I am no expert on Asian cuisine but I do know what I like. The portions were decent sized and tasted great. One thing I thought was lacking was service, since I am not Asian I found I wasn't given as much attention as some of the other customers, which was unfortunate. I also found it a little pricey but good food usually comes with a price. Great place for some good Sichuan, I'm told it is pretty authentic so thumbs up there as well!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of 5, and service is a little disoriented. Was asked to wait when tables were open, and only given a table once we inquired about the open ones. Decor is great, so no complaints there.   You order on iPads, which is a nice touch. Lots of options (some might say too many), though my Mainland friends gave some good suggestions.  CAUTION: Spice level here is pretty intense - But you'd expect nothing less for Szechuan food! Here's what we ordered:  - Lamb and Fish Hotpot (VERY spicy)  - King Oyster Mushrooms with Snow pea shoots  - Shredded Chicken & Noodles (cold dish, spicy)  - Sliced beef with chili oil (cold dish, spicy)  - Pork Dumplings   Total came out to about $60, so about $12-$13 per head with tip. They messed up our order once, and forgot to give us our rice (then charged for it). Come in groups of 4+ so you can try different things!   Overall: Good Szechuan cuisine experience, and I'm saying that as someone that's been to Chengdu & the real Sichuan province."}
{"text":"Best Si China restaurant in Town.prices average $10 -$15 per plate. Portion sizes are huge and usually meant to be shared oriental family style. Any person who enjoys authentic traditional Chinese food would thoroughly enjoy this restaurant given how authentic it is. Extremely flavorful and spicy. We're taking chug ice water per bite, spicy. Heavy in sauces and not for the weak when it comes to stomach acceptance to spicy foods, but well worth your while if you're craving descent Asian si chuan food in town.   Service is not ideal and you have to work hard to wave down the waitress. Debit & Credit only. But hey, if you're familiar with any Asian scene, you won't be too surprised.   Highly recommend if you miss tastes of Asia and definitely a gem on Mississauga. I'm a frequent customer here and when my brother comes in from out of town it's always the first restaurant to visit right off the plane."}
{"text":"Service sucks but I don't care. The food is worth waiting 40 minutes to get seated (it's crowded, okay fine) and then 15 minutes to get a menu (hmm, iPad ordering though) and then another 20 minutes for the first plates to come out (okay seriously? I'm REALLY hungry now!). There's a lot of self-serve (get your own styrofoam boxes from the counter when you want to pack to go) and some attitude from the servers (but it's just a typical Chinese restaurant). But I promise the food is still worth the 5 stars overall:  Because this is one of my favourite places to get authentic sichuan in the entire GTA. The food can come as spicy as it gets, and is always rich in flavour and brings the taste of home. The cold noodles are a delicate balance of tangy chinese vinegar with savoury spicy chili oil topped with fresh garlic and green onions. Your mouth will water as you mix the dish, which bulges out of the plate because it's so stuffed to the max. The noodles are made from a green bean paste, and have a nice clean texture that melts in your mouth with just a bit of chew. Other great appetizers are the spicy dumplings and wontons, and the green onion pancakes. Main dishes are plentiful - classic ones are the fish flavoured pork, chili chicken (careful - this ain't your Manchu Wok chili chicken and can knock your spice buds off), and various hot pot dishes. Veggies are always fresh and flavourful, and must tries include the sichuan green beans (packed with flavour), the hand-cut cabbage (a little smoky!), or the snow-pea leaves (subtle and more refreshing).  The portions are big, and costs are around 10-15$ per plate. You can easily get by with $15-20 per person, and often have more to take home.  If you're craving authentic sichuan, come here. Just come before you're actually hungry because you'll be in line for a while."}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant a number of times with my parents for its sichuan cuisine. I am not from sichuan but I want to say this restaurant has some very authentic tasting dishes. The portions of all orders are very generous and a great value for money. If you enjoy and can handle spicy (meaning not your average North American spiciness), and particularly numbingly spicy foods, I would definitely recommend you to give this place a try.  The following dishes are a must-try in my opinion: - Beef slices and tripe in chili oil (classic dish) - Sesame green onion beef rolls - Spicy Eggplant  - Clear noodles in chili oil - An assortment of vegetables in thick and aromatic sauce (chinese broccoli and mushrooms)  Be mindful that these are not the official names on the menu, in fact I believe the menu is in Chinese only."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher rating. The food is actually alright but the service is really poor. Every time I have come here, even in off hours, I have stood waiting at the front to be seated. The staff will see you there and even make eye contact but will ignore you until they are ready to talk to you. At least acknowledge the person waiting and let them know what the expected wait time is.   After trying this place 3 times with garbage results each time, I will drive to Vaughan, Markham or Scarborough to get Chinese food."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times. Each time has been delightful. Authentic food with incredibly fast service, albeit slightly abrupt and impolite.  The food was definitely well made and very reasonably priced, but friendlier staff would have made the experience better.  Since the last time I was here, the restaurant has implemented iPad menus and ordering. It makes ordering easier with pictures and more precision."}
{"text":"I give one star cause there isn't a zero! Food is no that great, ok food,  not Sichuan food for sure. And the serves is just as terrible as you can imagine. None of them can \"see\" customs. They just treat you as air. Standing there for 5 min, no one comes around. After we went to the counter, told them we have two people, and then they leave us for another 15 min. Terrible terrible terrible. If you like go to a restaurant that can't even order a food? Recommend ( ´??` )"}
{"text":"Went there as a friend recommended the place. We ordered their famous Peking duck as my husband was craving for it. Our order came with a soup and a side dish. It was huge for two. We were satisfied and would  definitely go back to the place."}
{"text":"Came in at 8pm and placed our order latest 830pm via iPad. By 9:05pm, not a single dish has come out. You can see all the surrounding table have gotten something on their plate. We asked them how long it will take and the old lady said, \"it's a very busy night and there's a line up\". Afterwards we noticed this table thay came after us was just served 3 dishes - one including what we similarly was going to order. Clearly this line up doesn't mean in the order we came in, just whoever they felt serving. Also this place is unsanitary, people cleaning up dirty dishes and then seating people and grabbing the supposed \"clean utensils\" right after. I had lots of time to spare to observe this as you can tell. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"TOO SLOW!  Been waiting for almost an hour and made us move the table near the washroom.   This is not cool, even the food is not bad, but the experience was bad ."}
{"text":"So I swallowed my pride because I am a sucker for Chinese food and I am glad I did. The food here is awesome. We ordered the Sichuan chicken, a prawn dish and sliced potatoes, they were all fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Asked for water twice and had to go up and get it myself. This is a sit down family restaurant, not a take out place. Also food took its time to arrive"}
{"text":"I am not from Sichuan, so I admit I am not creditable for saying the food here is authentic. But they are for sure delicious, and seems authentic enough for me. I had an amazing dinner here. Corn soup, pancakes with beef, tofu... every dish I tried were well cooked and I couldn't stop eating. Spices are a major part of Sichuan cuisine so most of the dishes are spicy. But there are certainly bunch of choices available for people like me who can't stand the spiciness.   Their menus are full of pictures which makes ordering easier. The restaurant is clean and nicely arranged. Prices are slightly higher than average though."}
{"text":"Who knew that there were soo many Mainlanders in Mississauga??  I suspected as much, but when you visit a place like Bashu Sichuan, it's obvious that they're taking over!  ;)  (And I guess this is 1 reason why there aren't many reviews for a place that has been 'round for a while.)  Location:  In the same plaza as Oceans and Toys 'R Us, in the North end, away from the hustle 'n bustle.  I think Bashu is sandwiched in between KFC and a nail salon.  Atmosphere:  Brightly lit, modern décor, it was quite busy on a Saturday evening.  Booths around the perimeter.  Round tables in the middle could use a bit more space, a bit of a hassle when you're going/coming from the washroom.  If you're in a group of 4, a booth would probably be more comfortable.  Washrooms were pretty clean, updated.  Menu:  Pretty extensive, half of the items had photos which is good.  Too bad online menu does not fully reflect what the restaurant has to offer.  Aside from focusing on Sichuan (hot 'n spicy with lots chili/garlic) cuisine, there are also items for people who can't take spicy, re:  lemon chicken, general tso (very mild), garlic eggplant, dumplings, dim sum, etc.  Menu does have a chili (or 2) to indicate that item is spicy.  Food was good and based on the atmosphere, it seems authentic.  Like other restaurants, there are some dishes that I prefer over others.  If you're in the mood for Chinese, but feel like something 'different', this is a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"This is a cash and debit only place. Make sure you come prepared.  It is often packed, and either you are required to wait for a LONG time or they'd tell you you won't get a table.  The servers are not so friendly, but they are quick! They give you an iPad to order off of, which is pretty cool.  I have always been a fan of their food. It's nice and oily and spicy, and have great Sichuan variety too."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular there. This place has gone steep downhill since it changed its owner. Barely any service during dinner, but forces you to pay a \"service fee\" which they don't even disclose when you make a payment. The food is average, but I had upset stomach after having their hotpot fish (i eat hot and spicy food at other Sichuan restaurant so it's definitely not due to its hotness) Do not confuse this restaurant with the original in Scarborough. Will not be returning to this place ever again"}
{"text":"I've heard that this restaurant changed owners recently so I went with my family there to re test some of our favorite dishes. We had the stirfried eggplant potatoes and peppers and each vegetable was cooked perfectly while keeping their own taste. Our favorite was the cumin beef, so tender! Overall the dishes I was really happy that none of the dishes were overly salty, which tend to be a characteristic for most Northern Chinese based cuisine. Now I can have my favorite dishes at this place without feeling guilty of loading up on salt haha. Their iPad ordering system is also convenient and I can imagine it being very helpful for non-Chinese customers to visualize what each dish looks like before ordering. One more thing, their portions are huge! Mt family of three ordered two veggie dishes and two meat dishes and in the end the leftovers we took home with us lasted us two more meals! Definitely one of the best Northern Chinese style restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"We were told about this place when visiting, and it was only 3 miles from the hotel we were staying, so give it try.  Very flavorful and with large portions.  The price is very reasonable compare to the states.  But it is a very busy restaurant on the weekend (with limited staff).  So we ordered take out (note it takes a while wait as well, but the wait is worth it).  I think you can order online and pick up, which save times."}
{"text":"Do I need to call 911? Is been an hour and still didn't get my food, the chef better be dead or fainted."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend for an early dinner (around 4:30 PM). Not sure if the staff wasn't on their A-game or what, but it took forever to just get tea and the digital menu. After submitting our order, another 20 minute wait before our the first half of our food arrived. The second half seemed forgotten because we had to remind the staff about the second half of the order. When we were done, we waited again for the bill. I got frustrated and ended up going to the front counter to pay.    The food however was very good. If the service was up to par, the meal would have been excellent. The food was fresh, noodles were not overcooked, the food had a great flavour. Food was 4.5/5. Service was 1/5. Hence the 3 star rating.   If Service was improved, I would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Good (spicy) flavours and you can use the iPad to see pictures of what you're ordering. The steamed dumplings are juicy and hot. And we always order the stir fried noodles (see picture). The curry ho fun had too much curry powder in it. The deep fried roll that we ordered was fresh and delicious when dipped in the sweet condensed milk."}
{"text":"Today I came to eat dinner with my family and friends and ordered fried rice and 4 other side dishes. One of them was steamed fish. from there we waited for half an hour and got 4 dishes but they forgot the fish dish. I asked once and they said that it would come soon. We waited for 20 more mins and they replied with the same thing. Eventually we asked for the fish 3 times in total. We got tired of waiting so we ordered stir fried noodles as we waited. Even after finishing the stir fried noodles the fish still didn't come. In total we waited for an hour and a half for the fish and usually the dish should only take around half an hour to prepare and steam. We've complained to them many times but they haven't replied to our complaints in a professional matter; no explanations, no apologies, nothing. This was my 2nd time eating here but I'm never going to come back."}
{"text":"I have been eaten here for almost 3 years. They have traditional and authentic Sichuan food( my favorite). The chilly dried beef was a must-have for me, not mention the spicy beef in a hot pot."}
{"text":"worst tomato fried egg dish I've ever tried, super bland and tasteless. I complained to the waitress Annie, she said that's the way it is and there's nothing she can do. so I asked for the manager and boss but no one came. This is the way it is, you order, you pay, no exchange."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Szechuan food then you have come to the right place. They serve flavourful Szechuan cuisine that originates from the Sichuan province of China.  I have no problems with the service but like any restaurant I recommend  going on a weekday instead of the weekend.  My go to dishes  from Sichuan  would be anyone since they are all very authentic .   The  Chicken Wings with  Chilli sauce are filled with flavour and  its a must order dish. My other go to dish is the mixed seafood noodle. I love the softness of the noodles and the good portion of seafood in it.   Chefs Special Chicken  was another dish that I have enjoyed because its tender, spicy and  is a good representation of Szechuan cuisine.  Its also a good place to bring groups for a casual dinner  when  nobody feels like cooking ."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??  The soup noodles are generally good and large. I especially like the beef in red sauce. The soup noodles also can come with your noodle of choice. Whether you like flat noodle, vermicelli, or hand pulled Shanghai noodle, the soup base can be the same for the different noodle types.   The dumplings are good too. They have pork and chive dumplings which is my go to and they also have pan fried pork dumplings.   I like this place because it's spacious and there's vip rooms in the back if you want more of a private space. When you order, you get your own iPad so you get to see pictures of what you're ordering and you select everything you would like to eat on the iPad.   LAST TIP?!  They take credit card so you don't have to worry about the cash only element to a lot of Chinese restaurants. The appetizers are good options to go with too. If you like beef shank, get the spicy beef shank slices with tripe in some spicy oil. Good way to excite your palate for a hearty Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"Back again for my 7th or 8th time but this time something was missing. Firstly our fav. Cumin Lamb was a one star, nothing but fat!!! Taste was just soso....The salt&Pepper squid also sub par. They did not even have white wine for us. We had reserved for 20!!! Everything else was just OK this time around. Not sure if they changed the cook of just cutting corners. But if its like this next time I come they will lose a good customer."}
{"text":"Food- depends on the cook's mood. WORST customer service ever- I made reservation for 6 people the day before. They didn't seem to have any problem with it and told me that my table would be reserved for me.  The next day, half hour before my reservation, they gave me a call claiming that they were not supposed to make reservation for groups under 10ppl they were having a lot of customers so they were going to give my table away to walk in customers(all the way yelling at me).  I was so mad since it was very unreasonable and no one had told me that we were not allowed to make reservation so I asked to talk to their manager. She then said \"okay, I will hold your table for you\".  My parents went there earlier than I did so they got the table first. The servers then started keep yelling at her, telling her that we shouldn't have made reservation. Making it seemed like it was our fault. They were doing our huge flavour to give us a table. We walked away and never returned. I couldn't believe such thing would happen, it never happened to me in the 25 years living in Hong Kong."}
