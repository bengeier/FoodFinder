{"text":"extreme disappointment. The establishment was super warm when I walked in, despite it being a beautiful day outside. The next red flag was when I ordered the shish tawook plate, and upon seeing the cook put the chicken on the flat top instead of grilling it. I wanted to eat in, but there were no chairs on the tables inside the place, and I asked the cashier how was i supposed to eat in when there were no chairs. He didn't seem too concerned nor did he go and find me chairs. I told him never mind, I would eat in my car. The chicken was very bland and the  veggie rice was ok. very mediocre food and service to say the least."}
{"text":"Although I have lived in Lakewood for almost 4 years I just realized this place existed two weeks ago. I have been twice and each time the food has been amazingly delicious. Their hummus is to die for. It seems to be just one older gentleman running the place and he is an excellent cook. It is worth a visit, order the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) and hummus. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great, truly authentic and quality food. Hummus is the best I've ever had. Love the kafka.  I just wish tea was on the menu because I think some version of what us English speakers call chai would go amazingly with everything on the menu.  They have vegetarian options that don't make you miss meat. But they also have great meat items.  Chicken shwarma!"}
{"text":"I usually don't post reviews, but this place blew my mind. I grew up in Saudi Arabia and this is the most authentic and closest to home (with taste) food I could find. It's soooo cheap too!!! Made me feel like I was back. Def worth trying"}
{"text":"Great place.        Great food.  Very Nice people, pleasant and welcoming :) They have a variety of Lebanese food that are great to try. Mainly lahm baajjine that are amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome little Mediterranean restaurant. One star off cuz of the working hrs inconsistency."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just tried this place for the first time. I've been going to Prana Bodhi yoga and walk by this place all the time and it never occurred to me to stop in until a friend recommended that I try it.   Great place to come for manaeesh, my favorite is the zaatar. The bread is perfectly toasted and crisp, just like how grandma used to make.   Prices are unbeatable and so are the flavors! The owner is very friendly. There is street parking available, which shouldn't be a problem.   Go get manaeeeesh!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best falafel I've yet had in my life. It was outstanding!"}
{"text":"great authentic Lebanese food at a great price. the owners prepare every dish fresh to order. extremely delicious and consistent."}
{"text":"What an awesome hidden gem of deliciousness! Seriously though, if you did not know about this place you would just drive on past it, very unassuming. Inside is very plain as well, just the kitchen and a couple spots to sit if you want. I mean, that's okay by me though, great food beats out fancy d√©cor any day! Only negative is that during the summer prepare for boob sweat inside because it is freaking warm up in there! But to be fair, I think most older buildings in Lakewood don't have central A/C (or don't use it, or I am just a sweaty beast).   I only saw one man working, and I assume he is the owner. He seems a little gruff, but he'll crack a smile or let out a little chuckle so no worries. Prices are pretty great! They range from $2-$13, so you're definitely getting great food at a low price (definitely no trendy markups here).  -Chicken Shawarma $8.95: Marinated sliced up chicken over what appeared to be a form of dirty rice with some veggies mixed in. Came with pickles, garlic sauce, and a lettuce/tomato salad. The main dish was a bit oily, but very good!! Garlic dip was perfect and not overpowering.  -Veggie Sampler $6.95: Hummus, 2 grape leaves, 2 falafel, tabouli, and pita bread. Falafel was excellent! Everything was pretty tasty, just again, a little too much oil for me so I had to dab it off.  -Spinach & Feta Pie $2.50: Big, cheap, and very good!   He was out of desserts or otherwise I would have tried one of those as well. So glad I decided to check this places out! Can't wait to go home tonight and eat some leftovers! Mmm"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Cleveland and it has the most authentic Middle Eastern pies I've had in the states in years. Although it doesn't look like much from the outside, the food is amazing and very authentic. Very reasonably priced and you can't go wrong with any item on the menu but my favorite is the meat and cheese pie."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets! The hummus here is to die for! Way better than anywhere else in town hands down (Sorry Aladdin's you don't stand a chance). I had the falafel pita with tahini and it was the best I've ever had! So crispy and full of delicious flavor. This spot is a hidden gem!! Please check it out and I guarantee you will leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Adega is the classy new Mediterranean restaurant at the 9. I am not going to check it out. I prefer to support family businesses like Oasis Bakery in the heart of Lakewood. I also have less of a chance of running into Johnny Manziel at Oasis which is a blessing. I was disappointed when La Pita Express closed down a few years ago. Oasis took over the location and is doing a great job at providing excellent Lebanese food to the community. The meat is delicious and halal. The falafel and tabouli are great vegetarian options. Oasis is slightly closer than the many great Middle Eastern places on Lorain Ave so I will dine here a lot. I have not had a bad meal. If somebody suggests Aladdin's or Taza, tell them no and go to Oasis."}
