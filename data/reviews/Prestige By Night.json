{"text":"Very disappointed. We came in to watch a show by the \"comedy riot\" group composed of 5 comedians from the Philippines. Only 1 out of the 5 came (AJ) with the special guest Keanna Reeves. The audience were never informed that just 1 of the advertised headliners is there until the actual start of the show. The organizers still charged full admission price. They gave away prizes which is a discount for purchasing a condo unit in the Philippines. This is after we paid $35 to watch the show.  The place also has poor insulation. It is very cold inside even when dressed appropriately. The food is also not very good, the calamari is very salty. The chicken wings are bland. The food gets cold quickly too because of the poor insulation.  We will never come back to this place ever."}
{"text":"The place is ok. it is big but kind of dingy at the same time. too many Men that goes here just to pick up Filipino Women. Lots of Women who are also looking for hook ups. I feel when i come here that I am cheap. I don't know what it is but it is not a classy place.  the Ambiance that it gives almost like a hook up place for desperate people.  the music is ok, sometimes the DJ not sure how many are they i think gets confused with the music. they sometimes play the same music twice in 15 minutes intervals also they play the same music every time. I come here maybe 2 times a year just to take a break from the hustle  and bustle with my girlfriend & i notice the same music playing from 6 months ago.  also the Food is not something you will look for after either. they need a better chef.  I am not a negative person but since this is a review i have to tell the truth.  if you like classy places and a place where you feel you wont get hit on by an Old Man who thinks he is rich like Harvey Weinstein. Please do not come here.   having said that. Big Parking and Waitresses are Nice and ok Looking. I am great friends with the Manager and he is great to me and my friend whenever we come here. he is the only reason why i do so as well. i give my business to him instead of the other bars. i support him that's all.   if he did not work here, then I wont come."}
{"text":"We ordered food and it never came. Service was rude and security was rude. Place was poorly lit. Other patrons were also stuck waiting for their food. Don't ever come here."}
