{"text":"This restaurant is actually called the Bruceton Grille, not Inn. The food was ok, but they don't give you a lot, and the fries I got were cold. The service was terrible. They were very understaffed with servers, but had six hostesses standing around doing nothing."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to dine at Bruceton Grille and see what it's all about. We were one of 5 tables in the dining area at this particular time. We waited 10 minutes for someone to stop and ask what we wanted to drink/give us a drink menu. Another 10 minutes to bring drinks (we only ordered water while we contemplated our drink order). Once our waters were dropped off we ordered food (I ordered a bowl of spicy stuffed pepper soup and my fiancé ordered an open faced pot roast sandwich). Curious of our wait time, we took bets on how long our food would take and we turned on the stop watch on my phone. After waiting 32 minutes we had no food, never once saw our server, and the booth beside us sent back 2 of their 4 entrees. I was hoping to see our server and check the status of our order, but she was no where in sight. We're not ones to walk out since we didn't want to start from scratch elsewhere. My fiancé and I got up to leave and conveniently ran into one of the two servers \"helping\" us that evening. We told her that we've been in the restaurant for almost 1 hour and we only have 2 waters. She never once offered to go back and check on our order or try to correct the issue. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. Came home and ate cereal since we were miserable and not in the mood to whip anything up."}
{"text":"This place is flat out horrible. The food is below mediocrity. Prices are well above what it's worth. Found a piece of hair in my meatloaf. The meatloaf just sucked to begin with and when I brought it up to the waitress and management staff about the hair, they said, no one in the kitchen has hair. This place is a joke. You can definitely do better and recommend you do so."}
{"text":"As it just opened a week ago, I will try to be kind....    We had a wonderful waiter, after the first one was obviously overwhelmed by a party of 6..... Hmm.... Was  seated quite promptly , but then waited 15+ minutes for a waiter to show up [#2]. Then about another 10 for the order to be taken. Once served, 20 minutes later, my companion has the roast beef sandwich which he said was excellent. I had the Black and Blue Shrimp Salad... Never had warm lettuce before, and the 4 tiny shrimp were obviously cooked a long time before serving... Like rubber. The flavor of the balsamic dressing and the blue cheese was terrific, but if I had made this at home, I would not have served it to my guests for its poor quality.  The bill with just the two items and one iced tea came to $34 with tip, sorry too high for what was served. Being a Friday night, in Pittsburgh, I was surprised there were  no fish specials, just three choices on the menu, grilled salmon($17), some sort of breaded shrimp, and my salad . With the number of Catholics here, they need more seafood or vegetarian specials on a Friday.  Had high hopes a good restaurant in the area. Don't mind at all paying for a good place, but if this place doesn't make some MAJOR  changes soon, it won't make it either. Staff needs to be better trained, menu needs to be tweaked, kitchen needs someone who can put food out promptly and well made.  Also saw no sign of a manager type... Odd....."}
{"text":"All around bad experience.  It was 88° outside and 90° inside. Took some time for server to ask what we wanted to drink. Hardly saw server while dining and didn't get a drink refill until five minutes before we left. Asked for the check, that was another 15 minutes. Server said I could substitute a salad for fries, ended up charging me for it and when I questioned it, he apologized and said he should have told me. Son's chicken looked like it came frozen from Sam's ($11) and the food is way to expensive for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Pros: Gave 3 stars because they're new, the food was good, and atmosphere nice.  Cons: prices high for basic entrees & limited menu (hopefully this changes), waited over 10 minutes after we sat for a drink order, then over 5 minutes for her return & take our order (which I insisted at this point). I had the burger which was really good & so were the fries. I had a hankering for buffalo wings so I got those too - which were great. My parents entrees (chicken basket & hot turkey sandwich) were decent but nothing to write about, really.  Recommend: once you get your investments balanced - you gotta lower those prices and have more choices to survive there. It's a great building with ample space with the great patio.  Get something unique for a draw. Pleasant hills needs something non-franchise to watch the games. Pittsburgh alone, does value family owned / independent business- use that to your advantage"}
{"text":"Sign on building said closed until further notice. Wasn't able to eat there.  No date on when it will reopen."}
{"text":"New restaurant with nothing new. You need an IDEA to launch a new restaurant. None here. Wings, burgers, and very ordinary sandwiches with - what a surprise! - sports TV! Yuk. High prices for food and small drinks. Owners start over or join the others who failed at this location."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials: full price on everything but Miller Lite. Best of luck, but I think I'll wait for whatever comes next in this space."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us in our party.  They advertised happy hour.  Two of us ordered drinks.  One drink was made incorrectly. Waitress said that the bartender had never made the drink before. The person ordered a different drink.  It was over poured. Maybe to make up.  We ordered mozzarella appetizer. 3 came on the plate. Those who ate them said they were ok. Our orders were fried shrimp, side salad, chicken parm, cheeseburger with lettuce, onion, and pickle only with side of mayo and ketchup, 6 garlic parm wings. 2 cokes, one coke with lime. Waitress said we don't have limes. I ordered a captains and diet coke. She asked me if I wanted lime. I said that I thought you didn't have limes. She said the kitchen doesnt, but the bar does. Duh...I said no lime for the drink, but bring lime for his coke.  Captains came with lime in it.  Orders come.  Shrimp came with fries and the person ordered fries because he didn't know and Waitress didn't say they came with fries. She said she would take them off bill.  Cheeseburger came with lettuce, onion, pickle and tomato. Not how it was ordered. Chicken parm was overcooked and dry. Cheeseburger was good. But mayo was separated and dried out. Wings were not crisp, but done. One tiny piece of celery. Bill came...she had wrong orders on the bill. No discount for happy hour.  She took it back to correct, still wrong when she came back.  Food was just ok and I agree with other review, food on the line of Eat n Park. For 4 people $85.  Pricey for quality of food.  It was extremely noisy and difficult to carry on a conversation. This is not a place we will be returning. Hopefully, the food quality will improve."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Our server was great and so was the food. I had a build a burger and my husband had the open face pot roast beef sandwich. We were very happy with both. Brownie with ice cream desert was the perfect ending. We will be back! Want to watch a game here... They have tv's on every wall in the bar!"}
{"text":"Soooo!!! Wanted it to be good!! I swear I need to have a restaurant....come on man....what were the owners thinking.... After eating out more than I probably should have I can put together a better menu .....If your nachos are worse than the local high school football games....on the high end pricing on the low end food... you need to rethink the choices made."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to try this place. We had eaten at this restaurant before when it was Wentzell's. It looks like they have kept some of the Wentzell's employees. The decor has changed and it looks a lot nicer.  I started off dinner with a drink. It was supposed to be Sangria with fresh fruit. I'm not sure what was in it but it was a very week drink. The fresh fruit was a lemon slice and a cut up strawberry. Very underwhelming.  I ordered the fish sandwich that came with two sides. I chose coleslaw and Mac n cheese. The piece of fish was enormous. It had a crispy outside and the fish was cooked nicely. The bun was toasted and was a nice compliment to the fish. It had lettuce on it and the tarter sauce seemed homemade. It also comes with tomato and lettuce but I asked to leave those off. The Mac n Cheese had NO flavor. One bite and I was done. The coleslaw tasted like it was half onions. The onion flavor was incredibly overwhelming. Two bites and I was done.  My son ordered the buffalo chicken salad. There was no tomato or egg on it as was stated on the menu. It had two chicken strips on it. They were small. It needed one or two more. It also was bland and not spicy at all. Again, very disappointing.  The two stars is for the service we received.  Nothing else was worth any stars."}
{"text":"15 min wait to be seated , and when we walked back to be seated there was at least 20 open tables.  Allot of young workers standing around doing nothing .Service was ok, menu was not big at all. Prices was very high. 12 dollars for a gyro?? Was not that impressed.  I don't mind spending money on good food, but I could have went to the gyro place up the street and got a better gyro for 7 bucks."}
{"text":"This is the 4th business to open in the same location. If it doesn't fly they should just raze it. Hoss's gave way to Damon's gave way to Wintzell's Oyster House gave way to what is now The Bruceton Grill. There are few changes to the space. The bar has been dressed up and there is a cigar bar in the rear. The dining area was untouched and even the artwork/decor is much the same.   The drink menu looks decent and the drinks are definitely cheap. There is a page of shots and a page of mixed drinks. Drinks and wine are mostly $5. The food menu is basic (good looking but basic appetizers, burgers, some salads, sandwiches and dinners that \"include a dinner roll\".) We had a Black and Blue Shrimp Salad, some wings and a side salad. The food is somewhere around a Denny's quality. Since the restaurant just opened today I expected the fresh factor to be a little higher. The salads were all iceberg lettuce, which was mostly crisp I guess. The wings were totally average at best, served just layed out on a plate. The shrimp salad had 4 small-medium shrimp in it and was just ok. Service was average, but being the opening day I can understand some lag.   The formula is the same that Damon's had. Basic. Wintzell's offered something different for the area. I'm not sure how this business will set itself apart from other establishments in Pleasant Hills, but it needs to. The food is not special, the drinks seem cheap. There is no real draw. There were no specials. I hope that others disagree and have a much better experience because I hate to see businesses fail, and Pleasant Hills is a great town in need of more great places. If Bruceton could grow, offer something other than Eat N Park fare, and have some kind of draw it could make it, unfortunately I think it already needs a major makeover to get people to come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is ok. The major problem is food is average the menu is limited and the prices are high. This service is good the staff knows their job well and it's not their fault the prices are set so high with such a limited menu. I feel that this restaurant could someday be decent as the location is good."}
