{"text":"We came here for Summerlicious. Wow the atmosphere, the price and the food. Amaazing.  The waiter was very friendly and courteous.  If you havent already been, a definite must."}
{"text":"I am referring to the BRUNCH only.  I used to come here for a delicious Sunday brunch around 2003-2005.  I recently went back and was extremely disappointed in the quality of not only the food, but also the buffet set-up (spatulas are caked with food) and the staff working the buffet.  

At this point, they're simply relying on their reputation from the past to pack people in there.  

I definitely won't be back.  Try Boiler House instead"}
{"text":"Here at a conference from San Diego. Food was wonderful and more than I could eat, staff was very attentive and helpful, and hostess was simply lovely, warm and welcoming. Definitely recommend. Love garlic week especially!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with the family and I really enjoyed the live jazz performance that was happening. The food was far from life-changing however they had some pretty delicious omelets. 
 
The environment seemed a bit crowded but it wasn't uncomfortable. The service was great and our server was very helpful.

I would recommend this place for a large group of people. It would be a bit too hectic for a small table for two."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. I find this place is always pretty consistent in terms of food and service. I go here a lot and tend to order the same thing but occasionally mix it up. The mussels and calamari which are always just so delicious. The servers are friendly and knowledgable. I have not had one bad experience at this place. Their menu really has something for everyone so I feel good about bringing various friends here and knowing they will find something they will enjoy. The drinks are great, I find they are a bit on the expensive side so I don't choose this patio as often as I would for that reason but they make a mean mint mojito."}
{"text":"I've eaten here with friends or family maybe forty times over the last 10 years. It never fails to be an excellent experience: delightful staff, delicious food, and ample portions for greedy types like myself. It's smart enough to be suitable for special occasions, but unpretentious enough for a spontaneous bite to eat."}
{"text":"Expensive, slow service and food wasn't worth it. Took 45 minutes to give us our food. Fish and chips special was 17$ and they used way too much sea salt on the chips, I would describe it as 'McDonalds fries' but with way more salt. Don't think I would recommend this place to anyone. And that 17$ mediocre fish and chips lunch did not include a beer."}
{"text":"Some good and some questionable food.

We've been to Hot House 3 times.
First time I had the mushroom gnocchi, and it was so good.  It was heavy, but fresh and flavourful.

Second time I had the mushroom gnocchi, the cheese sauce had obviously gone bad.  The whole dish tasted really off, with a little sour aftertaste.  I also had the mussels, and they were nothing to write home about.  I would not order it again.  We both did not feel very good after that meal.

Third time (we went back because the wait for another restaurant was too long, and we were hungry) I had the jambalaya, and we both thought it was one of the worst jambalaya we've had.  It was basically some pasta sauce with 3 tasteless shrimps, some bland chicken, and thinly sliced sausage mixed with rice.  Tasted like ingredients drowned in heavy sauce without much spice.  I wouldn't actually call that dish a jambalaya.  
My partner's Mongolian Beef entree was good though.  He ate the whole plate.

Service has always been friendly, restaurant is non-pretentious, clean, and spacious, and the complimentary bread is much appreciated and memorably delicious.  The bread is probably one of the reasons we go back to the restaurant lol"}
{"text":"For my birthday I chose to come to the Hot House as it has always been consistent in quality and quantity. Today definitely did not disappoint. 

As a starter, we ordered the chipotle mussels which were quite delicious (but you need to ask for more bread to really appreciate all that flavourful goodness). And shrimp app that was served with yummy shrimp chips and a spicy sauce. As entrees we ordered the Sicilian Gnocchi, which I go back to every time (makes my tummy happy always).  We also ordered a spaghetti with shrimp pasta- lots of flavours packed into one little bowl ( lunch or dinner size servings are available).  Overall the food was quite tasty and we had no complaints 

We ordered a mojito (yay real mint) and a margarita (yay freshly blended - but make sure to specify you want the fresh stuff to your waiter/ress) 

The reason I'm giving the hot house a 4 stars instead of 5 is because of a small issue when we first got there.... When we arrived it was still raining but we still wanted to sit outside (which any torontonian can appreciate as we only have a month and a half of summer). There are two sections of outdoor seating: one to the right and one to the left, both partially covered by an overhang. The one to the right we being served but only had high seating, which we did not want to sit at as one of our party has a physical issue with it. The one to the left had low seating, was a bit wet, but had plates and cutlery already set up. 

When we asked to be seated there we were told that the section was closed, and were offered a place on the high stools. We insisted on the low seating but were then told it was wet and if we wanted to check for ourselves to see if it was too wet to sit or not, but the waitress did not want to offer wiping it down for us... It was a \"take it or leave it moment\" we opted to sit inside but eventually made it to the high seats outdoors as one of our group members were able to finally get on.  As a former bus girl and waitress, a current restaurant owner, and someone in the hospitality business I know that waiters and waitresses should always try their best to make guests happy, as long as it is a reasonable request, like we had. You don't have to tell someone you have a physical disability in order for a waitress to wipe down a wet table and keep an eye out for you if you're sitting out of her immediate section. 


Anyways !! When the waitress was serving us (at the high seating) she was most courteous and was pretty attentive to anything we asked for. I don't think she was trying to be rude when we first got there, but i think she couldn't have been bothered with our comfort. 

Ciao for now."}
{"text":"Wish I had gone sooner! 
I've heard tales of the famous Sunday brunch at Hot House, but only had the pleasure of enjoying it for the first time last week.
Excellent service, the jazz band and the wide variety of excellent dishes exceeded my expectations. 
A not so hidden gem in this wonderful city!"}
{"text":"After hearing many good reviews from co-workers, I decided to give the Hot House a try and it definitely did not disappoint. Went with a group of 5 for some after work drinks and dinner (they have martinis on special every Thursday) and we all enjoyed the food/drinks as well as the experience.

Management came by to check on our table and seemed very attentive. Very reasonable pricing considering the size of the portions and much better value than Jack Astors in my opinion...

Will definitely be coming back to try out the brunch :)"}
{"text":"I want to say I'm indifferent or neutral to this place, but I've been meaning to try Hot House for a while because I live in the vicinity and it always seems to be popping, especially on the patio. I eventually went here and tried their Summerlicious menu - that was my first mistake. My friend and I ordered the artichoke dip as the app, which came with three measly, slightly burnt pieces of pita bread and the tiniest dip. The steak frites was drenched in a questionable brown sauce and on the burnt side. The gelato was decent, but overall disappointed. I was with good company, which helped distract me (slightly) from the slow and inattentive service (took a while to order extra cocktails.......) Overall, disappointed and my advice would be not to participate in Summerlicious if you're just going to cheap out. Don't participate for the sake of participating."}
{"text":"I love the patio at this restaurant in the summer. They have couches outside and a beer in the hot sun in the middle of the St.Lawrence Market can't be beat. I wouldn't go there in the winter though. The decor inside is a little bland, dated and strip-mallish."}
{"text":"I went in to the restaurant on a Friday evening. My friend ordered the salmon with fries. I ordered calamari and asked the server if I could order mushrooms with the burrata instead of beets. He said it was no problem. Well, to my disappointment, I got limp calamari and mushroom bruschetta with asiago cheese. The mushrooms smelled really off. My friend's salmon was delicious and the fries that came along were decent too.

I didn't bother complaining about my order and waiting for it to be replaced as we were to catch a movie right after. That being said, I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Good solid food, fairly priced and well presented"}
{"text":"When in doubt of what to eat, drop by Hot House.  They've been around forever, love their brunch.  Last Friday we tried having dinner - they have a pri fix menu for $35, you get salad or soup, 12oz steak, dessert.  One person cannot finish it.  We are glad the food quality is still holding up....Service in the beginning was ok, near the end, it was nice, there seems to be tonnes of staff working that night, and they were all busy.  Need to head down in the summer to see if their brunch is still as good as 5 years ago!!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent! So happy with the service! When we arrived, they were ready for us and escorted us to our section. We are a bus group of 50 and we were seated in our own section.  The food was hot, with plenty of variety. It needed no seasoning. The French toast was to die for. Along with the ham. Delicious gluten-free chocolate cake. They also made sure our bus driver was fed, after he parked the bus. All I can say is we need one in Baltimore!"}
{"text":"What Hot House has going for it is its patio. The patio is huge and usually sunny. Great place for drinks. I've been here several times and the food is fine. I've never had anything terrible, but I've never had anything particularly memorable either. That being said, it's a good place to go with a group because it's big, the food is inoffensive and the booze selection is decent."}
{"text":"Came here for their popular brunch.  We had reservations and had to wait 15 minutes for a Sunday 11am reservation.   Staff very friendly and courteous while we waited for a table to be available.  We asked to sit away from the live band when we made the reservation and they honoured that request perfectly.

Brunch was a selection of comfort foods:
Roast beef
Ham
Bbq chicken
Lasagna
Tortellini
Mussels
Different types of sausages
Potato/omelette cake (kind of like a quiche/frittata)
Plus more!

The cake station was very popular, they have staff managing it so you have to line up to receive slices of cake.   They even have dairy free, gluten free chocolate cake, aside from the classics like strawberry shortcake, chocolate cakes, chocolate raspberry Moses cake etc.
Etc

Food is tasty, but can get very busy during brunch!"}
{"text":"PLEASE STOP WITH THE JAZZ MUSIC!!!!!!

The brunch is incredible, been here 100x. But the jazz band is so horribly annoying, nobody wants to yell over their table on a sunday afternoon.

Please stop with the jazz band! 

Literally NO ONE likes it."}
{"text":"Once again the hothouse cafe provided excellent food and excellent service at a very descent price. I've never been disappointed. Tonight we just split 2 hors d'oeuvres and a salad. Shaun split our salad onto two plates, and brought bread for our mussels. Their staff seems to take pride in what they do, and gestures like this reinforce that."}
{"text":"Kind of indifferent to this place. The food was okay and the beer wasn't the coldest. The service was kinda slow but the atmosphere was great and with friends and a few drinks this could be a great spot for drinks. I would return but probably only for drinks."}
{"text":"I love nearby and I think have probably spent over a grand at this restaurant. Mother's Day, New Years, BDay, Holy Communion, Confirmation, Graduation....Literally almost every milestone of my life I have ate at this restaurant for. The staff are always kind. Food has always been above par, and just a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Attended a Bridal Shower Luncheon on Saturday 10/24/2009 and overall the service and food was GOOD..........
Greek Salad - Have had better
Atlantic Salmon with steamed veggies - OK
Pink Velvet Cake from \"Dufflet Pastries\" - Amazing!
2 Thumbs Up to our waiter AJ he totally went above and beyond the call of duty being present and so into the moment of catering to 15 women!"}
{"text":"AVOID. My co-workers and I went for lunch and I cringed when this place was even suggested. I went along with it because I didn't want to come across high maintenance. Now I know why I don't come to this place.

This place is lucky they're getting even ONE star from me. First off we waited an hour for our food. Then finally....while we were getting our food brought over the server walks behind me with a massive plate of oily, meaty, creamy pasta and proceeds to drop the whole plate all down my back, all over my new, and I might add, very expensive jacket. It was completely covered in sauce and oil stains.

The server really didn't seem that bothered and after I left to go home without even eating, one of the other servers has the audacity to say with regard to the other server \"I'm not responsible for what he does\". I was very gracious at the time but am now LIVID. Then the manager calls me and offers to pay my dry cleaning and said he has sent a gift certificate with my friends and my lunch. That was nice of him to do..but too bad they even managed to send me the wrong bloody lunch! A pasta with meat...to a vegetarian. Great thanks. Beyond inept & just pathetic.

I will be giving the $50 gift certificate to a homeless person."}
{"text":"I'd come here for dinner years ago and I wasn't very impressed, but my friends insisted the brunch was worth it--and wow, it really is.  Every time you think you're done with the buffet you realize there's another table that you haven't even seen yet!  

There's a great selection, from traditional breakfast foods like French toast and eggs (there's an omelette bar!) to things like shepherd's pie and baked pasta.  The place is busy, which means service isn't that prompt (drink refills took a while, as did plate clearing).  It's a good place for a large party, as evidenced by all the extended family groups in the place, but I probably wouldn't go back unless someone else really wanted to go there."}
{"text":"Brunch was good, and had an enormous variety of items, but the things that were wrong on this Sunday afternoon were the basics.  The eggs were poor quality and the bacon was deep-fried and deep-fried *way* too long.  If there are two items at brunch to get right, I would think eggs and bacon are the ones. 

That said, the desserts were amazing, and the cappelletti and cannelloni were great, the roast beef was exactly how I like it, nice and red. 

I am not a huge fan of buffet, as I just overeat and at the same time, rarely eat enough to cover the cost of the meal.

The Hot House is strangely laid out and even with a Jazz band playing (a scorching 25 minute rendition of Caravan) the place felt corporate and bland. 

If you are looking for a good buffet, then you might have a hard time beating the selection here, but for the money, you can get full elsewhere, and with better food."}
{"text":"The signs outside the restaurant had a large amount of dessert advertising. Since this is what we were looking for we went in and got sat down. The waitress was not happy when we informed her that we were only there for dessert. We got the tiramisu and the chocolate utopia and they were both delicious."}
{"text":"What can I say... I think the Sunday Jazz brunch is highly over-rated (although yes, the waffles are good).  The regular menu is average.  The place is huge, true...but it has no soul.  Doesn't feel like an urban eating experience to me - more a suburban one.  Not a huge fan.  But, if you have a big group - it's a decent enough option."}
{"text":"5 stars for the coffee alone.  

They serve the commercial blend of Folger's concentrated coffee.  I recommend the Ham with Gruyere Cheese omelette."}
{"text":"Long time Hot House customer and usually very satisfied with Hot House.  However, went to Family Day breakfast on Feb 20th.  Disappointing.  For $16.95 eggs and bacon and sausage, waffles and pastries, no toast, coffee/tea not included.  First and last time for Family Day breakfast."}
{"text":"The Hot House is an overrated place that old people go to and the buffet was despicably disgusting. The food reminded of a school cafeteria and even a school lunch would've been better. The cakes were dry, the create your own pasta was bland and had no taste, and the lasagna looked like it had come out of a freezer. I would not recommend this establishment, avoid at all costs, and enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends after work and was greeted by the most enthusiastic hostess/owner of the restaurant. She was super welcoming and repeated \"thank you so much for joining us\". Waitress was super attentive, and service was great. 

I tried their winterlicious menu, dinner was only 28 dollars, which to me is a steal. Their \"surf and turf\" (lobster and steak wrapped in bacon) was delicious, though the lobster was a bit on the salty side, which is why I took off a star. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not our first choice for valentine's dinner but they had room and away we went! Service throughout was excellent.  Lovey had the fixed price menu ($45) and I went for just a main.  She started with the crostini with beets and mushrooms, followed by beef wellington.  Both were excellent with the main being done a perfect medium-rare. My main was the chicken stir fry - a large portion! dish that came out hot and perfectly done. Loveys desert was the pannacotta - she did all but lick the plate!

Got to admit it was hard to find any reason not to like this restaurant!  Great service,  great food and the ambiance was nice! Absolutely would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was below average, tasteless and nothing to brag amount. I will not be returning.. Basically my pasta was bacon bits and peppers in a sauce that was as tasteless as it looked.. Service was good food was horrible."}
{"text":"This place offers brunch on sundays and my husband dragged my family here after eating there and let me tell you, this place is amazing! I was so stuffed after eating here but the food was totally worth every penny (littly pricey at 22$ per adult).. They offer an omelette station (reminded me of the resorts in the carribean).. although the line up for this was way too long so I let my family members get theirs and then tasted theirs and they were all good.. There is a pastry station with waffles! A salad bar, and the best part of it all, lasagne and pasta.. to die for.. I will definetely be returning.. On a side note, I got charged incorrectly because we were a large group and the managers were kind enough to reverse it.. And the server who served us was probably the most obnoxious and rude person I have ever come across. Remove her out of the picture and I wouldve give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Soooo I was downtown looking for food and came across this place.. 

A few things to highlight:

Food was average...  I ordered the hot house penne...  It was spicier than I thought it would be...  But perhaps I'm just a Lil panzy...  There was a robust amount of sausage in my pasta which was good but there was so much more meat than pasta...  If rather have more than less but there needs to be a nice balance...  Was still a decent dish.. My gf got the sicilian gnocci which she said the pasta was a little too mooshy...  Her pasta was pretty heavy... 

The nachos were good.... Portions here were pretty good especially since we had to pack up all 3 dishes lol... 

Our server James was pretty friendly Imo.... 

Service in general was a little slow but not as bad as some other yelpers have received...  But we went at like 6 pm... 

Ohhh one thing that can be improved is to provide complimentary bread...  That should be standard at a place like this... 

Overall I wouldn't mind going back and perhaps try something else... 

So congrats Hot House Cafe you are TooTuff approved!!!!"}
{"text":"I needed to write a review about this place as I have neglected to do so for some time and today is my catch up day.  So we used to come here regularly,  always enjoyed the food but had to stop due to the number of mice scurrying around the dining areas. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick dessert after having some pizza nearby.  Since my friend and I had never been in Toronto before, I looked at the previous reviews for this place and it seemed decent enough so we decided to come.

Once we entered, the atmosphere was welcoming and pleasant.  We were seated and when the waiter came by I asked for the toffee pudding and a hazelnut cappuccino.  As soon as I uttered the words \"hazelnut cappuccino,\" the waiter gave me a look and asked nastily, \"And where do you see that on the menu?\" as though I was five years old.

Unbeknownst to me, apparently flavored cappuccinos are a little harder to find in Toronto then in my native New Jersey so I guess I was ordering something that wasn't on the menu, but certainly there was a friendlier way for the waiter to handle my request.  He could have just said, \"I'm sorry but we do not offer flavorings, only plain cappuccino\" with a half-smile and that would have sufficed.  Instead, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, despite the regular cappuccino being decent (small as it was for $4+).

The toffee pudding was good, not great, and the vanilla ice cream on the side was the size of a large tablespoon, way short of a typical scoop served with desserts.

And of course as I was finishing up the dessert and some diners around me were finishing up their late dinners, this friendly waiter seemed to disappear without any warning.  Then after a few minutes, a nice younger gentleman took his place and handled our checks.  Since the young man was pleasant, I gave my usual tip but truth be told, I was not impressed with the way I was treated by the original waiter.  

What these businesses always fail to realize is that one member of your staff can make or break you.  If I'm in Toronto again, I will NOT be returning because I want to have a nice dessert, not a lecture about what is or isn't on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for YEARS and have never had a bad experience or a bad meal.  I am very particular about how my food is prepared and the servers are always very patient with me ;)  They get my order perfect every time I am there.  We had my daughter's birthday dinner there a couple of weeks ago and then her Sweet 16 birthday party there this weekend, a large group of young ladies.  The servers Charlie and Carlie (sp?) were quick, attentive and catered to the girls, made them all feel very special.  Everybody enjoyed their food and dessert.  Arif and Peter made sure that our party went smoothly and went over and above to ensure a great time for us.  Food is always fresh and good portions and the staff warm and friendly.  Would recommend this place for a quick bite or a sit down meal for a large group."}
{"text":"Hothouse is a very good restaurant to get together with either family or friends. The menu has a good selection, and the wine list provides a lot of variety. 
I had a pleasant eggs benedict, and my friends had omelets. We had a relaxing brunch on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is definitely for brunch on Sunday that you have to book well in advance.

It is always pretty busy but finally after a couple of times that I've tried to book it for me and other 2 friends we finally found a spot on a Sunday morning around 11:30am.

The food is very abundant and all the staff there is very friendly and nice. 

The only thing is that sometimes they have line ups when you want something specific at the buffet and I usually can't stand waiting too much for food, but it's ok.

Some may find it is a bit pricey but in downtown Toronto where isn't?!

I love the fact that you are right in the heart of St Lawrence market district and you can walk pretty much every where and you find quality food or places to go.

It is also close to my favourite hair salon, Tony Shamas, so every time I go for a hair visit I usually come here after even just for a drink with a girlfriend.

It is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"For great ambience on Front St., and for bringing visitors into town from the USA, it was a great location.  Flatiron building, super vibe down in the St. Lawrence District, great skyline views, my USA friends were impressed.  The restaurant itself, only been there once, was pretty standard, and it seemed to be really popular with the business/suit crowd.  Definitely get on the patio here, 50% of the experience is being out on Front St.  The food was good, nothing out of this world, but tasty, quickly prepared (and we were pretty much close to peak lunchtime) but now and then, we had to chase down a server to ask for additional things, i.e. they didn't check up on us except the usual \"welcome, sit down\" and the standard, \"how is your meal\".  It took us quite a while to get the bill, especially since my out of town guests wanted to explore the area!  All in all, a pretty good pitstop for food, but like I said, the patio is the thing."}
{"text":"Came here for the valentines day menu with my beau. This will not be the last time I come back!

My boyfriend had the soup of the day which I want to say was minestrone, and i had fried rice balls (i forget the actual name), for the appetizers

for entree we both got steak, which was the disappointing part. Maybe it was a bad night, but we bought got the fattiest part of the cow, i had to throw out 20 or 25% of my steak due to fat! It was tooooooo oily for my liking, i get that they used truffle oil but it was borderline soup. So stay away from steak.

For desserts he got toffee pudding or something like that, that was really good and i got tiramisu. Both were heavenly delicious!!

Service was A+, Manager and server checked up on every table 

Food A, minus the plus for the oily, fatty steak

Interior A+, I also loved the soft music and the elegance

Next time i come i'll be trying the sunday brunch buffet! and pasta and pizzas"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go to St Lawrence Market on a Monday...when the market was closed. We didn't know until we got there. But, the surrounding stores were still open. We were starving and this restaurant stood out to us.

They have a good selection on their menu, but I feel like it doesn't stand out. I tried one of their pasta dishes and it was really tiny for the price of 15 dollars. The pasta was not outstanding, but it was still tasty.

This restaurant is huge on the inside and outside. It also has a pretty view of church street in the St Lawrence Market (:"}
{"text":"Good food, usually friendly service, prices are high but that's to be expected for the area. Overall a good place to eat in old Toronto"}
{"text":"A great meal and excellent service!  Split an entree and two all salads, leaving room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch. The food quality was ok and the selection is not huge. 
The service was pretty poor. The hostess gave us attitude when we requested to change seat (it was pretty hot under the sun and we were literally melting) We asked for our bill and the hosted said she would let our server know and she never did. The service was very slow and our server was nowhere to be found for a good fifteen minutes. We had to walk to the counter to pay for our bill because we were not going to spend another fifteen minutes waiting for the credit card machine. I am not sure if I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch with Numerous Deelish options! Everything I had tasted good or great. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a decent restaurant. The atmosphere was nice, it almost had a brunchy kind if feel to it. There was a lot of seating, for two, four, or more, and there were lots of windows letting natural light in. 

The food was decent, but not amazing. I had a pizza and a salad. Both portion sizes were good. The salad was very large, and is very much a meal sized salad, the plate was heaping. The pizza was also good. It was thin crust with multigrain options. I got a pizza Margherita, but their pizza Margherita is not a pizza Margherita. It has peppers and other ingredients on it, I'm kind of a traditionalist, so I didn't like that very much. 

That said the food was good, the wait staff were a little bit slow, but present, and periodically checked in with us to refill drinks. 

The place doesn't really stand out for me. The food didn't knock my socks off, and the atmosphere was just ok. A decent place to get lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with this place. A great menu (heavy on pasta dishes) where everything I have had has been excellent.

Some standouts are the Gnocci in blue cheese, the penne a la vodka, the three bean salad and the Caesar salad.

Prices are fair for both the food and bar. Atmosphere is lively but not too noisy. It's great for groups, couples or solos.

Best of all the place is consistent. A real regular for me."}
{"text":"The food is meh...
The only good thing: (they serve in large portions) and the sticky toffee pudding was really amazing"}
{"text":"Arguably the best brunch buffet in the city. Unlike other buffets where with low quality cuts and powdered eggs this place doesn't cut corners. Everything is fresh, plentiful and delicious. Plenty of breakfast lunch and desert options. You will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had the jambalaya, too much sauce and a few too many peppers. 
The gnocchi was very good. Crab cakes were also okay. Caesar salad was very good. Service was adequate but not great. 
Overall it was an average experience. 
We have hundreds of other places in Toronto to try before returning."}
{"text":"I come here for one thing...the gnocchi. It is so dammnnn gooodddd!!! Little pillowy balls of heaven, mixed with a gorgonzola cream sauce, mushrooms and pancetta. How could anyone NOT like this, cmon! I haven't ever had anything else there, but on several occassions my mom has had the crab cakes, and jambalaya and another friend the cheese capaletti, all have received very good reviews. 
N.B. For all you vegetarians out there, they also make a vegetarian style gnocchi minus the pancetta. 
Also this is from the dinner menu, have never been for any other meals."}
{"text":"I did the brunch buffet here a week ago. This place is adjacent to the Flat Iron building in St. Lawrence. 

I was surprised by the capacity of this place. It's huge. The waiting area was packed on a Sunday at 1pm.

Food

There's plenty of selection in their brunch buffet but the quality of the food is very disappointing. I struggle to find anything decent tasting and I really question if the chef / kitchen staff is actually tasting the food that's being served - it's really bad.

After sampling a cross section of the foods at the end I was making my own croissant sandwiches with the meats and cheeses and getting the omelette station guys to cook up some spinach on the side. 

The live jazz is the place's savings grace. 

Food is 1 star, but add another 1 star because of the band."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Had dinner there, could've been better. But hey, at least the place looks nice. Don't get the lobster pasta thing."}
{"text":"It's gettin' hot in here. so take off... nah. 
 
But that's what I thought of when my friends told me we were going to The Hot House. The inside was quite nice with huge gigantic tables for large parties-- a mega bonus. The staff was super nice, our waitress was kind enough to take several rounds of photos. She was also rather generous in bringing the 3 bottles of wine we ordered throughout the evening. 
 
There were pretty pleased faces across the table during the entire evening. We all pretty much opted for a pizza of some kind. I got the PIzza Capicolla with capicolla, fontina, and ricotta. The capicolla was amazing tasting! I could've just eaten that. I also nibbled on the waikiki- great caramelized onions and the Il Diavolo- super spicy. I can't complain, it wasn't outstanding but it was certainly good enough. 
 
I'd love to go back and try a pasta dish. Although it is fairly pricey but comparable to other Italian joints in the neighbourhood.

Sidenote: I didn't really have enough time to explore The Hot House, but the washrooms were off the hook!"}
{"text":"This is near St. Lawrence market. We went by here on our trip to the market and it looked like it had some good vegetarian options for my friend. I got a salad and a tropical drink. Both were really good. The server was very friendly and was very genuine when he talked to us."}
{"text":"Great buffet on Wednesday nights.  Did not know so it was a pleasant surprise when I stopped by last night.  Just get there before 8:30 pm since it closes down at 9 pm."}
{"text":"Hot House is a wonderful restaurant. Big enough for groups, intimate enough for just a table of 2. I have had several menu items and nothing has ever disappointed.  I suggest the Sicilian gnocchi or the lobster pasta for any pasta lovers out there. 

Try and get a seat on to patio if you can. It's a nice area and we don't get enough summer months in Toronto to not enjoy it while you can. 

Waiters tend to be pretty flat here. The service is fine, but the servers are often a little uptight or just flat out dull with no personality. That's ok though,  the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is usually busy.  I can only credit it to the location (great patio) because the food is mediocre at best.  I also attended a wedding celebrations here and the food was much better than what is offered on the menu.  Would only eat here if it was the only place left standing after an apocalypse."}
{"text":"I took some friends here for brunch. The place is very nice and clean and the service was great. The vegetatian fritata was amazing and i am not a fan of eggs so thats a big deal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for a late dinner after a ten plus hour tourbus ride to get here.  Located in the heart of downtown Toronto, we were thrilled to have to wait only 10 minutes to patio seating.  Although not fine dining, this is exactly what we were looking for!  I had a very tasty pasta dish and my husband took a chance ordering the lamb...and was pleasantly surprised.  Most impressive was the friendly staff.  This was at the tail end of a crazy busy day, as Toronto was in the midst of their Buskerfest.  Lots of people and enegy in the street!  Yet all the staff we encountered gave exceptional service.  We recommended it to some friends who were also in town and they also enjoyed their experience there the following night.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great for get-togethers! The staff here are so accommodating and took excellent care of all of us during a large family function. There's even a sign at the front hostess stand which states 'Reading glasses available', so I'm guessing it caters to an older clientele. The food is pretty decent but nothing memorable, I wouldn't mind coming back for brunch on their lovely patio when summer kicks in."}
{"text":"We had our wedding here in August 2016 and Hot House was nothing short of amazing! The food and service was absolutely incredible!! Shout out to Erin and Arif for all of their help and hard work, they made the planning process so easy."}
{"text":"I visited Hot House because for a work lunch and was surprised to find such a large venue like this in downtown Toronto. Because of it's large size, I noticed that a lot of big groups end up here which when I visited ranged from medium size groups of professionals to families / tour groups. The prices were fair considering that the styling of the place was pretty old and traditional - more of what I'd expect to see at a restaurant in the suburbs than in downtown Toronto, but then again I am more of a person who dines for the overall experience rather than just one key thing like the food / novelty / decor. I ordered the vegetarian pasta off the menu and my waiter somehow managed to write my order down as 'with meat'. I had to send back my plate and the staff were very attentive in fixing my order for me - the manager visited my table to apologize and even comped the meal. 

In summary - Fantastic service and great for big groups. Don't take anyone you want to impress here as both food and decor are very meh."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for Mother's Day Sunday brunch. The place was pretty busy. They have live jazz during their Sunday brunch which added a nice touch to the ambiance of the place. Decent selection buffet items. Some items that made this buffet unique were the smoked salmon, steamed mussels and the huge variety cakes. Didn't get a chance to try their cakes as I was pretty full by the end of it. I did tried the omelette station but it was nothing special, I could probably make the same thing at home. The service was attentive and the food was refilled regularly but the food quality was just average."}
{"text":"I feel badly because I should've written about this place a month ago. But here goes ...

Came here for a friend's birthday brunch. It was a Sunday, so the place was definitely hopping. 

The food selection (despite my late arrival) was fairly decent - everything from eggs, bacon and sausage to little finger desserts. As other Yelpers have mentioned, this is a good place for groups of any size. Pricing for what you get is also good.

Since it was a Sunday, there was a live band playing ... which is good IF you're not sitting next to them. (This was what happened in our case, which meant we had to raise our voices to speak to one another.)

I'd say decent overall."}
{"text":"Had a group of 20 people here last night. We had worked with Hot House to have a custom menu, 3-course meal prepared. There were many options which was great. Here's a quick outline of our evening:

1. Got there at 6:00 pm, left at 9:00 pm - too much time between courses, main course took very long to come, but understandable, it was a big group.

2. During service, sour cream was dropped on the floor that went all over some of our guests bags and coats - very apologetic and cleaned up.

3. One of the main courses (the Salmon) came completely raw on the inside, everyone else's was fine, it was just this one - again, very apologetic, gave the individual discounts for next time, etc etc.

4. Large portions, I personally had the steak, which was ok, the chocolate cake afterwards was great, should have ordered a glass of milk with it!

All in all, interesting night, not sure of this is a typical night, but that was our experience. I will be going back at least two more times, and my group is expected there another 6 times over the next month, will continue to post if the experience gets better or worse."}

*Famous for brunch on Saturday & Sunday
*Live Jazz

Hot House Cafe is located near St Lawrence Market and is famous for their brunch buffet on weekends. I've passed by this place so many times on weekends everytime I went grocery shopping to Metro which is right next door. I went in October so the weather was warmer back then, you can dine inside the restaurant or sit out in the patio (during summer).

Brunch buffet is $19.99 so it's def not cheap...but...who can pass up on Breakfast Buffet? I can't! Hot House Cafe was on my list for awhile and when my friend (tiny one who eats twice her size) was visiting me from Vancouver, so I decided to check it out with her.

Their buffet station consists of hot food, cheese & fruit station, pasty & bread station, cake station, meat station as well as omelette station.

There were about 20 different types of bread varying from rolls, banana bread, baguettes and croissants. At the meat station, they were serving turkey, roast beef and ham as well as cold salmon on the side

Omelette station consistently had long lineups throughout the meal because they make it for you on the spot. Few of the choices that could be added to the omelettes were ham, green onions, cheese, fresh tomatoes and grilled onions.

Hot food station had about 10~15 types of dishes starting from your regular scrambled eggs, sausages, lasagna, bbq chicken, bacon, potato hash and mussels.

It is a buffet so I can't comment on everything that I've tried, but few of the dishes that stood out to me (got seconds of) were:

*Omelette: surprisingly done very well, it will depend on what you add but I added onions, bacon, cheese and mushrooms

*French toast: drenched in walnut and raisin syrup, it was delicious with the real whipped cream on the side

*BBQ chicken: it was well marinated and cooked throughly. there was some smokiness to the sauce which i enjoyed

*Lasagna: very cheesy and it tasted very home-made. It was so comforting!
Mussels: the mussels were small in size but the soup was really good (tomato based)

*Caramel cheesecake: good consistency and I liked how it wasn't too sweet

The service was excellent at the Hot House. Our waitress was super friendly and refilled our water consistently.  I went back one more time with my family after the first visit and I made the mistake of going without a reservation. MAKE SURE TO CALL FOR RESERVATION!!! I had to wait for an hour and 40 minutes....and it was not fun.

Summary: Overall, I would say the food is quite average for buffet style restaurant. I just wish omelette station didn't take so long, and would like a hot crepe or waffle station. Food is refilled constantly which keeps it fresh and never empty, which is important for buffet restaurants. Nothing impressed me out of the standard, but I left full and happy. Would I go back? maybe in few months!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Wide variety of dishes and the dessert is to die for. Never had cakes sooooooooo amazingly delicious. The best value for money. I will be back again and again and again with friends and family."}
{"text":"Fabulous! 

Went there last night for a birthday with over 20 people. We had reservations and they were fantastic. Very accommodating with bringing in an outside cake. 

Service was incredible and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Insanely popular for their brunch on Sundays, Hot House serves up a delicious buffet with live Jazz.!

It's a madhouse, so you'll want to make a reservation.

The first time you see the buffet... it seems huge!
Station after station with pastries, breads, spreads, waffles, bacon, sausages, yogurt, prime rib, seafood, salads, fruit, desserts.... all that is considered brunchy fare ($19).

Everything looks marvelous and you can't wait to take a bite out of everything!

The second time up, you grab some of the items your really liked and anything \"new\" that you missed.

Third time up... now you're just trying to get the best bang for your buck.
You don't really want to eat it...but you put what you can in your mouth and chew...slowly.

I'm not usually a buffet type of gal but I do love live music and brunch. 
If you are in the St. Lawrence market area and want to stuff your face, Hot House is a fun and glutenous way to start your day!"}
{"text":"I like this place for what it offers:  decent (if uninspired food) lots of space so no trouble getting a table.   It's a good place for a last minute, no hassles, pleasant dining experience, but not a good place if you're looking for interesting food or a special/unique experience.  What can I say - competent mediocrity has it's place sometimes."}
{"text":"The food was good. I went to the sunday brunch,  Truly worth it.  Great environment, food and the price was right!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many, many times and it always the best.  Great service, food, location and reasonable  prices. You can't ask for more than that. Sunday brunch is outstanding. Make a reservation well in advance."}
{"text":"I'm rating this for their brunch buffet.  You would think a weekend brunch buffet for $20 per person, would have eggs Benedict!! Instead you serve lasagne, and cakes for brunch?   We made a reservation two weeks prior to going and was told that we would be seated near the buffet.  We arrived with our party of seven on time and were told that our table was not yet ready, then almost ten mins. later were finally seated and was told  we did not have a table near the buffet. Then for being a brunch buffet you would think that there would be more then one omelette station.  So instead you had to wait in line for almost 20 mins to get your omelette that was the size of a small dessert plate.  The food was sub par, the scrambled eggs looked like they were shipped in from the McDonald's menu. To top it all off I came home and started to feel very blotted,cramping,sick and nausea for the whole day.  I couldn't even get up from the couch. ( and No I'm not pregnant) My husband also was feeling nausea. I couldn't even eat dinner.  If you value your money and your stomachs don't eat here for brunch."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my co-workers.  I ordered the lasagna.  It was pretty good, but I found it too salty.  The bread that they give you in the beginning is very good.  For dessert, we got a slice of tiramisu to share because we were celebrating a birthday.  It was quite good.  Nothing too special.

The service was friendly and fairly quick.  Can't complain much there.

Overall, for the price it was decent, but I found the food salty.

Would I go back?  It wouldn't really be my choice, but I wouldn't be against it either."}
{"text":"Good bruch, very extensive.  You have to be a large man to take advantage of this place.  On the expensive side."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for Sunday brunch whenever I'm in Toronto.  Great spread. Great atmosphere. 

I love the omelet station here. For some reason,  I've never come across a brunch spot that has better tasting omelets. 

If I'm in Toronto on a Sunday,  then I'm here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty consistent. Love the atmosphere and it's in a great location. Service was solid. My friend and I split the crab cakes which were pretty good. The pizza diavlo was very tasty. The star of the show was the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream, it is a must try. Overall I would give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here to eat on many occasions. I order different items off the menu every time i come and never had a bad experience. The staff is nice and friendly. 

This place has the BEST tiramisu I ever tasted. 
it is just divine and a must have after a delicious meal."}
{"text":"The name would suggest your food will be served hot. 

It won't be. 

We came here for Winterlicious and how disappointing. 

Firstly we were seated in a cold area with a great view of the Metro next door even though there were plenty of other seats. The chairs were very uncomfortable and the decor (in this section) was hideous. Some sort of net looking material on the ceiling. 

The Good:
1. Fast. The food came out fast.

The Bad:
1. Food. The food was horrible. The Caesar salad was tiny and looked/tasted like something you get from a cafeteria. The steak was bland, the vegetables were clearly from a bag, and the fries may have been McCain. No joke. The dessert (creme brûlée) was terrible. 
2. Service. Though the food was fast, we waited a good 10 minutes for someone to come collect the bill/Visa card. Also, a manager opened a door right beside our table to let 4 people out of the restaurant and it was FREEZING. Way to make our meal even colder! 
3. Atmosphere. A random blend of students and old people, the atmosphere here is more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. 

Recommendation: do not visit the Hot House, at least for winterlicious. I cannot comment on regular menu items but I can tell you I am not willing to find out after that experience!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Their french toast is one of the best i ever had. BBQ chicken, omlet bar, cheese, deserts, lasagna are few that i liked most.
The roasted beef was bit dry and place can be bit crowded. Have to wait in long line up and wait for the french toast to be refilled. 
Overall yummy food."}
{"text":"I've been for brunch many times for special occasions. The food and service is consistently good. Check out all the photos for the assortment of options."}
{"text":"Great brunch on Sundays- well described in other reviews so not much to add. One of the head waiters was particularly helpful with out toddler and attentive throughout. Huge choice for all tastes so good for a crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food served  in large portions. My lovely wife and I were visiting Toronto when we randomly picked the Hothouse for lunch because the ambience looks welcoming. We were on the hunt for a place that serves liver (we are both low on iron) and the Hothouse coincidentally serves it. Liver can be dry but they prepared it perfectly moist and delicious. 

The service was also professional, friendly and attentive. We were already amazed by the super friendliness of the hostess who was chatty and polite. From there, our waitress was personable with a good sense of humour and who wasn't in our face too much while we were eating. 

After our first day at the Hothouse, we decided to go back a few days later to have a tea and use our computer. We thought for sure we would be told something because the Hothouse is a restaurant and not a coffee shop but they were totally cool with it. Again, our waiter (a different one) was friendly and attentive, even as we sat there for a couple of hours sucking their air and not ordering anything more than a cheesecake and coffee. 

The restaurant itself is clean, tastefully decorated and has a nice wrap around view of Church street and whatever the cross street is. A good place to people watch."}
{"text":"Previously wrote a great review about Hot House for their yummy Sunday brunch. I've also had a positive experience at lunch here with a big group of 20+. Sadly my most recent experience overshadows these terribly. 

Went here for summerlicious lunch. This is a mistake in itself I admit -  most restaurants don't fairly represent their quality and cuisine for this event. Nonetheless I went in with low expectations. 

First, our meals took excessively long to arrive. Over an hour for our entrées which is unacceptable especially considering many patrons are here during a work lunch. 

Appetizers arrive and they are acceptable. Entrées come MUCH later and were probably the worst meals I've had in some time.  My friends got some Vietnamese rice noodle bowl which was a bunch of raw (unseasoned) ingredients thrown together and with a flavourless dressing. How this dish can take an hour to prepare is beyond me. 

My dish was borderline inedible. Steak and onion sandwich where the steak was ridiculously chewy, strangely seasoned, and the bread was stale, dry and chewy. I only ordered this dish because the rosemary frites caught my eye, however the fries I got were plain. When I asked my server about it,  he simply states they're having a bad day in the kitchen, and it's no surprise to him that my fries don't have rosemary on them. No apology, no offer for new fries or even a side of rosemary - take it or leave it. He probably just thinks I'm lucky to have received a meal at all! 

I don't blame the server, I know it's not his fault and he's probably swamped with other angry patrons. But even still, this dining experience is inexcusable. I would be okay with the wait times if the food was even half decent. We had to take our desserts to go, which turned out to be mush in a take out box that I threw straight in the garbage. 

Worst summerlicious experience EVER."}
{"text":"We wandered into the Hothouse Restaurant after seeing what looked a science experiment going on at one of the tables near the window.  Interest peeked...  that was the \"smoked old fashioned\" that we needed to investigate.  It was outstanding.  It is the reason this restaurant goes from 3* to 4*.  We decided to stay for another and figured we better have some food too...

The food:  we started with a finocchio pizza, which was the best thing we ate.  I had the sambuca pasta that was pretty good and my coworker had cappelletti, also not bad.  None of the food had us talking about it after dinner, but the smoked old fashioned is worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Went on Easter Sunday at 6:30 had a party of 11 for my birthday. The place was packed and the waiter was great very attentive and when my husband asked to return his jambalaya because it was way to spicy the manager came over and apologized and had it remade with no hot stuff the other 9 people and myself loved it the Sicilian gnocchi was amazing I kept stealing from my friends plate. Thanks for making my birthday great Hot House. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends and their babies! Really kid-friendly and they gave my party of 8 lots of room at the back during a Saturday lunch hour. The servers were so kind and took care of us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite buffet ever! If you have never been here for their Sunday buffet, hurry up and book a reservation!!! The food is amazing, the price is fair for the top quality dishes they offer, and the service is impeccable. We were there today and even though the place was packed, the manager helped us find a table that would be accessible for someone in our party that has a mobility challenge. Truly an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We had ordered here on Christmas Eve, also being a local patron in the area. We ordered the jambalaya and lamb burger, which came with a side of house salad. Upon a couple of hours of eating this, we had both experienced terrible cases of food poisoning. There was certainly food contamination in either of those dishes as we had shared the meal. Surely enough, this was a lousy Christmas experience. Never will I ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times for lunch and the service is slow slow slow. Do not go if you have only an hour for lunch. Food is good but the wait ruins it"}
{"text":"This is a lovely place for a Sunday brunch.  I was invited to a paint party bridal shower here a few weeks ago. I ordered the omelet with the toast and it was perfectly cooked. Service was ok, we didn't all get out food at the same time.  Portions were large and food was hot and delicious. Parking was not great but nothing in that area is. 
I would love to go again."}
{"text":"Whatttt ... only 3.5 stars? We went to the brunch buffet on Sunday and loved it! Great choices and options. Not overly crowded or picked over. Plenty of available seating and nice jazz quartet. Well maintained location with friendly staff. $26 for all you can eat - can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Such a fan of Hot House! Their Valentine's Day fixed menu was amazing. I tried the Sea Bass and it was beyond expectation and absolutely delicious. Their service was also quick and they have friendly staff. I have been going to Hot House for years and will continue for a very long time."}
{"text":"I've had some friends who didn't really like this place for some reason, but I came here with an acquaintance for summerlicious. 

The starters weren't that great and the dessert was ok, but the main was done very well. Had he ribs, and they were extremely tender and full of flavor. 

I'd definitely come back here after to try some of their regular menu items. Maybe I'll haul my naysayer friends back and force-feed the delicious ribs down their throats until they change their minds.

(Only suggestion I'd have to this place is to offer a better choice of starters if they're doing summerlicious again next year)"}
{"text":"Fabulous to wine and dine, the patio is the best in Toronto love the service .  Scott is amazing Andrew and his wife treat you like family. There is something on the menu for eveyone."}
{"text":"My other half and I have been coming here for years and I felt that I finally had to write a review because we had such a good time! We had taken the subway from the west end of town, and walked down to Hothouse. Usually we like to sit at the bar for fun, but the bar stools were packed last night (always a good sign). As we stood assessing the lack of seating, the floor manager recognized us, and escorted us to the patio seating which we had chosen as an alternative. I highly recommend trying their French Martini! For the first time in many years, I gave in to mussels. I had their chipotle mussels, and let me tell you, the bowl got polished clean! The sauce was killer! My friend also had the spinach salad, which never disappoints!  Don't listen to any negative reviews, after 20 years, this is still our fave spot in TO! Their chicken supreme rocks, as does their steak, and jambalaya, and tikka shrimp!!!  But don't forget to try their French Martini ;)"}
{"text":"For a place called Hot House, the restaurant wasn't very hot.

We came here for Winterlicious and we were not impressed.

The Food:
Came quickly but was the main was lukewarm. It also came out pretty bland. I got the surf and turf which had one jumbo shrimp and a 10oz steak. I didn't finish the steak because it wasn't worth the calories. The vegetables tasted like it came from a frozen bag and didn't taste fresh at all.

The Service:
We had reservations and there seemed to be plenty of space in the prime areas of the restaurant. Yet we were seated in the back /old decor section of the restaurant facing the Metro. We sat right beside the emergency exit. A manager decided to let people out of the emergency exit and let a cold burst of winter air in while we were eating. Finally it took a long time for our waiter to grab the Visa and the manager noticed and rushed to get it processed.

It's a shame because I really wanted to like Hot House but it left us feeling cold in so many ways."}
{"text":"I had lunch there with my parents yesterday.  The service was great, the quality of the food was great - we ordered from the Winterlicious menu.  Portions were a bit small, but not enough to diminish the experience.

I personally had the Cesar Salad which was excellent.  The Chicken Penne pasta which was really good too.  Then for dessert it was a lemon cake which was probably the best I've had.  

Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday night. When we got there it was packed, we had no idea that Wednesdays were all you can eat dinner buffet. We made reservations so we didn't have to wait too long, maybe 10 mins. My husband and I never tired the buffet here and the waiter kept raving about how good it was and the various selections they had to offer so we decided to give it a try which was a big mistake. The selection wasn't that great. Only things we actually enjoyed eating were the BBQ chicken and the cheese filled pasta. The roast beef was as raw as raw could get. The cup of water I got from the server was dirty beyond belief. Not saying I won't be coming back to the hot house but definitely won't ever be coming back for the dinner buffet. Seems like the servers are focused on way too many guests to actually serve you properly."}
{"text":"Very ordinary and nothing special. I do like the Sunday buffet but it is very blah. It reminds me of Marche, everything looks better than it taste. I give it 3 stars simply because although it is nothing to get excited about, as far as buffet is concerned, it is as good as it gets in Toronto. Unfortunately for me, I travel a lot in Asia, where the buffet table has been mastered.  I've also been here for lunch and it was just ok and dinner was less than OK."}
{"text":"HISTORY/ABOUT: Hot House Cafe has been a Toronto Brunch landmark for a very long time, I can't even remember the first time I went. They are open during the week and on Saturday for breakfast but make no mistake, the Sunday award winning brunch buffet is all I have ever ben interested in. 

DÉCOR/AMBIENCE: Cozy, moderately upscale. The type of restaurant where you can walk in with jeans and a t-shirt, and still pull off a blazer. Live Jazz on Sundays, very chill. I love sitting at the bar as well. 

MENU DESIGN/READABILITY: I have never looked at the menu, strictly come to slay buffet .

FOOD QUALITY: Ok. I will admit the food is not incredible. But personally I am a huge believer in spreads, and by spreads I am not referring to maple butters and artichoke dips. By \"spread\" I am referring to the sheer diversity of the food available. There are so many options - breakfast/omelette station, carving station, various lunch items, waffle station, bread station, cold salad station, hot station, dessert station, and more, it really is insane. 

On a standard Sunday I would normally plow through fluffy croissants, bacon, sausages, omelettes, waffles topped with strawberry sauce/maple syrup/whipped cream, meat lasagna, steamed mussels, roast beef & horseradish, pickles, bocconcini, soppresatta, greek salad, various cheeses, cheese tortellini, fresh fruit and I am sure I left a couple things out. For me to hit up a brunch buffet and have everything mentioned above and so much more in relatively infinite amounts, makes me a very happy camper. 

PRICE POINT: $18.95 for the Sunday brunch buffet, extremely worth it (especially when hungover).

SERVICE: No issues with service, hostesses and staff are friendly. I highly recommend sitting at the bar because you constantly have the bartender in front of you so you have essentially immediate service for drinks, plate clearing etc. 

BATHROOMS: clean. 

FINAL THOUGHTS: Definitely not a regular Sunday outing for me, but I do enjoy it quarterly. Again, you can not expect to be blown away by the food, there are some great tasting dishes and some not so good, but with things like waffles and bacon etc. you can't really mess those things up. Based on the spread it is a steal and well worth it for me, I do love this place for what it is."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, the restaurant was nice and the staff were friendly. The lunch dishes (Burgers, salads, etc) looked pretty good but I decided to order from the brunch menu. I got the French Toast which was three pieces of bread floating in a pool of syrup with some squishy sugary \"fruit\" on top. Maybe I don't have enough of a sweet tooth for this, but I think you would have no teeth if you ate this regularly! 

Overall it seemed like a good selection of food and ok prices but there are a lot of good restaurants in this neighborhood. I don't think this will be my first choice the next time that I go to a restaurant in that area."}
{"text":"I see the appeal.  Brunch buffet, which can sometimes be an easy option for a mixed-generational-group -- where can we go that great-grandma doesn't need to wait too long, where everyone can find at least something, and we can get in and out quickly?

It failed for me on a few levels.  First, you do have a server, and in my opinion if I'm giving you a tip, you might as well do something -- I think it should be mandatory to bring water to the table, for instance, whereas we only got water once asked and only for the people who specifically asked.  Coffee was fine, but for the group of six we only got a tiny canister of milk, and no cream at all.  

The selections for the meal were lackluster.  Make your omelette station is always nice, but not when the guy making the omelette screws up, offers to remake it, you say \"ok, sure, remake it\" and then he reneges and just plops it on the plate anyway.  Fruit selection was all underripe and unappetizing.  Basically no salads or healthier option besides that.  Not worth the price, or the wait.  I'm giving it three stars because it does hold a value in some circumstances."}
{"text":"Came here for a meet up with a friend last week. The place is kinda funny. It has been around forever (my friend had worked here 10 years ago). It reminds me of some of the casual restaurants of my youth, right down to the booths and the fresh bread on the table. 

I had a fancy cocktail (whiskey and vanilla) and Putanecsa Pasta with black olives, sardines, capers and tomato sauce. It is a classic recipe and this interation was served the way it would have been at most places 10 years ago. A giant portion with lots of sauce. It was very competently done , but not anything amazing.  

I have mixed feelings about this place. It seemed well...dated.  It has a giant menu, and seems to be trying to do a lot of things. Maybe a bit of focus on the classics and on the bruch buffet."}
{"text":"The staff from the host to out waiters and bus staff were all friendly, polite and professional.  The appetizer was more than large enough to satisfy four adults.  The entrees were delicious and filling.  Some of our party had drinks and desserts and the verdict was great.  I would recommend Hot House to anyone looking for a reasonably priced dinner with friends or family."}
{"text":"When i used to work in the area, my coworkers and I would come here every few months for someone's 'birthday lunch'. I always liked it for lunch.
I recently went to Hot House for the infamous Sunday Jazz Brunch Buffet. Wow! It's super busy on a Sunday! We arrived quite early, in between 10 and 10:30 and didn't have a problem finding a table for two inside near the windows. But there was lots of space on their great big patio as well and i would have gladly sat out there as well. It's farther from the food, but it was a gorgeous morning. 
I started my brunch with a chocolate croissant and some fruit. The croissant was really good! Super fresh and buttery with yummy chocolate meltiness inside. I went back for another. Second round was a waffle and some bacon. Mmmmmm..... baaaaacon.... I had more than the 3 or 4 slices of bacon that you usually get with a standard breakie. That in itself is worth it in my books :) In fact, third round i went back for more bacon. Had some roast potatoes and some cheese and... i forget, there was so much food! But we did spend a good couple hours there and casually sipped our teas and coffees in between plate fulls. Plus we enjoyed the live jazz as well. It was a delightful Sunday! There was quite a line-up at the omlette station so i would assume that's a popular item. I don't like omlettes myself so i skipped that. But they will make them to order for you with whatever you fancy. 
The price is quite steep but there is tons of food, and if you take your time, enjoy the company and the music, it's worth it for a nice Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"My partner and I frequent the Hot House Cafe a lot. I guess you could say that we're 'regulars'. It's close proximity, dependable food and great service makes it an easy place to go for lunch, brunch, dinner or just drinks on the large outdoor patio.

Known by most for their Sunday brunch, the Hot House serves up favorites such as lasagna, bbq chicken, salads, roast beef, bacon & eggs, and a dessert table that's undeniable. 

The prices are very reasonable and right now they are featuring their own 'Summerlicious' pre fixe menu. They also feature an annual garlic festival menu which I would recommend to anyone who loves garlic.

If you've heard about the Hot House but never tried- do it this Summer!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Hot House another chance since they had the ideal location to watch the Santa Parade.  I have to say their service and food has improved ten fold since I was last there.

The Sunday Brunch is open until 3pm and it is really delicious.  The head chef gave me a tour of the buffet and told me everything that was both gluten and lactose free.  This was a really nice surprise.  It was really nice of the restaurant to do this for me.

The servers are very attentive and friendly.  They kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  They have lots of drink choices on the menu and did not try to rush us out of the restaurant.

Sunday brunch at Hot House is definitely a great way to enjoy a Sunday morning or afternoon!"}
{"text":"We always try to make it to this spot about once a year about towards the end of June. Usually, summertime is the best because you can utilize the patio. The buffet never disappoints. Waffles, omelettes, french toast, scrambled eggs, stir fry, bbq chicken,  and a host of other dishes are freshly made. Service is always great, I have nothing to complain about the staff. They do have flat screens at the bar area to watch an event. This place is highly recommended for family and friends."}
{"text":"This is my goto place for a decent after work meal with my hon.
The food is tasty and they have one of the best summer patio's in the area.
There is lots of space here so it's not usually hard to get a table.

I recommend the mussels, calamari and penne ala sambuca and if you're thirsty they make a lovely sangria!

On a side note I would recommend ordering off the menu rather than having their weekend buffet."}
{"text":"The Hot House confused me.  Is it a casual diner or upscale restaurant?  Is it Italian?  A pizza/burger joint?  Corporate or family-style?  I honestly couldn't tell.  The font on the menu looked romantic date-night while the light wooden chairs looked like a sunday brunch place.  Such odd decor.

Food is decent here.  My husband and I shared a late-night, post-theatre bite of pizza and it was really good.  Spinach infused with truffle oil and wild mushrooms.  Can't complain about that.  But service was inattentive and slow - strange given that the place was half empty.

Do I recommend this place?  I guess.  I enjoyed the food, although my summary of the place comes down to the word, \"Meh\".

Vegetarian score: 7.5/10.  Decent veggie options - mostly pizza and pasta.  But it all seems yummy and not entirely cliche.  (And my husband informs me that he loves their chocolate cake.  Then again, he loves any chocolate cake.)"}
{"text":"I came with 3 other friends for a weekend lunch, during their summerlicious period. The menu was appealing and the price was fair, so we said why not?

Here's why you should not...
Their service was awful. We barely saw our waiter and the service was so slow. We sat outside, on their patio, and I don't know if it was because of where we were sitting, but I felt like we were forgotten a lot of the time. We asked to get a refill on water at least 3 times.

The food was only mediocre. The salad, the appetizer, was an arugula salad with balsamic dressing topped with peppers and apple slices. The main was a plate of jerk chicken, coleslaw, rice and a pineapple ring. However, there was no spice to it at all. The flavour was subtle, we asked for some peppercorn sauce on the side. Once again, we asked for the sauce at least 3 times. We received the sauce eventually. It came in a small tray (similar to the one you would pour your soy sauce into at a sushi restaurant)

For dessert, there was a praline-like scoop of icecream, which was the most flavorful part of the meal. 

When we received the bill, little did we know that the sauce would cost us an additional $3 each. THREE DOLLARS FOR A BIT OF SAUCE ON THE SIDE?! Why wasn't this mentioned before we asked for the sauce..? 

Service was poor, food was mediocre. I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"A good place to go for brunch near St. Lawrence. Spacious inside and nice street view.

Went there for brunch. Food was ok, not much surprises. The french toast I ordered was given a fancy name called \"Hot House French Toast\", should be their special, but not that special to me, as it got soaked in the maple syrup which made the whole dish very soggy and super sweet. Even I like sweet but still couldn't take that much. Next time hope they could offer the syrup on the side.

Other than that french toast, everything was good."}
{"text":"This review is really only for the All-You-Can-Eat Sunday Brunch buffet. I'll open by saying that their brunch buffet is pretty much the best AYCE brunch I have ever had. There are so many amazing options and everything is truly top quality. The only problem you may have is that this gem of a brunch buffet is now well known and so it's CRAZY busy every Sunday morning! Don't bother going unless you have a reservation. If you try to walk in, as I have once or twice, you'll be waiting 30-60 minutes for a table. You may also find that the omelet bar has too much of a lineup for you to bear but if you keep an eye on it, you'll find opportunities to jump in and get a quick custom omelet made to your liking.

Really, I can't say it enough that the food really is great during their brunch buffet and I really have yet to have found a better brunch buffet anywhere in this city.

As for their regular dining experience. I've been a couple of times and I found that it's absolutely standard fair for this kind of a restaurant. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Hothouse on a regular night than Milestones or wherever else but that's not a bad thing, it's just not a stand out thing. Really, Hothouse stands out when it comes to their Sunday brunch and that's when you should be making a point to visit!"}
{"text":"With all the options we had for dinner we chose this place. Soooo glad we did!! Our waitress was fantastic, our drinks were good and the Mediterranean Trio appetizer and the Waikiki Pizza were out of this world! If we ever visit Toronto again we will most certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Sunday Jazz brunch is a BUFFET! YES!

Not as urban or as cool or as cultured as the Boiler House (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/boiler-house-toronto). And yes it can be mistaken as a wannabe Boiler House...

But for a generic breakfast item brunch buffet it's still pretty damn good! ...Omelettes, roast beef, seafood and pasta, all the traditional breakfast items, the belgium waffles and continuous decadent cakes to choose from.  I can visualize the buffet right now.

It's good for my tummy, good for groups (even if the group of us are a little rushed at times) and also good for kids too!"}
{"text":"I liked the gnocchi quite a bit and the lemonade was really good. Three stars for the slow staff and their is no atmosphere. A family restaurant if that's what you are into. The apple dessert was nice, but otherwise it was average overall."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places to go for Brunch. It is full of wonderful food, from salads, roasts, entrees and breakfast foods. The deserts are also very excellent. In face there is too much for one person to sample it all. The service is fantastic and the ambiance is wonderful. It's a treat to come here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Throughout the years Hot House has always delivered great food and great service: these are the reasons that patrons are loyal. HH is always busy and if you have definite plans, you are best to make a reservation. During spring and summer, good luck getting in - whether inside or on the always popular patio in this lovely neighbourhood. 

I've never had a meal here that I didn't fully enjoy:  Penne alla Sambuca and Supreme of Chicken (stuffed chicken) are my personal and highly recommended favourites. I've always enjoyed any pasta and the salads are excellent. Their pizzas are very popular. Wine selection and desserts are always great. 

Whether you are just stopping by for a meal or a glass of wine or celebrating an anniversary/event, down-to-earth and family friendly Hot House is a favourite - it's a comfortable, warm, and easy atmosphere.  The host and hostess are always friendly; wait staff are friendly and attentive.  In many years (dining as a couple, small or large group) I can say barely any service issue (possibly the odd slowness of food during a peak time - understandable and not an issue for me) and never any disappointment with the quality of the food, wine, dessert etc.  I can truly say this for friends and family as well!"}
{"text":"Went to Hot House for their Wednesday AYCE buffet dinner for $21.

Service was good: waiter checked up on the table from time to time and water was re-filled frequently.

The items I enjoyed included BBQ chicken, roast beef, mussels, the lasagne, and the clam chowder. They also have a selection of fruits to choose from, such as watermelon, honeydew, grapes, and pineapple. There's a small salad bar, and a pasta station where you can build your own dish and have them prepare it for you on the spot. They also have a selection of cakes and other desserts to choose from.

In terms of variety, it's rather limited. Hopefully, they have enough items that you like, otherwise you may not have as great of an experience. There was definitely a lack of vegetable options for me, given that I'd stock up on leafy greens when I go to a chinese buffet. I guess at an italian place, you'd just have a mix of cauliflower, carrots, and some other vegetables. No leafy greens!

Personally, I found a lot of the foods to be quite salty, but I'm not particularly a fan of too much salt. Especially if it results in me drinking more water and thus having less room for other things.

Also, no ice cream. But cakes were great.

Overall, not too bad. It's located near st lawrence market, and I'm not sure what your options are for AYCE buffet in the area, so if you're just looking to get lots of food for a reasonable price this is not a bad option."}
{"text":"came here for weekend moring brunch.  had noooo idea it was a buffet.  
a little pricey for what I want on a weekend morning, but if you are a big eater then you will love it here.
great selection of food and deserts.  it was breakfast and i was in the mood for bbq chicken, go figure.  ka-ching!  it was tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food! So good we had to go back the next night! 

We stayed a week near the restaurant but didn't go until the end because it was not on the top of a lot of restaurant lists. Do not know why! 

First evening it was a party of five including myself as having to eat gluten free and we all loved the food. The next night it was just my husband and I who was willing to split two gluten free meals with me which shows that the gluten free was amazing!

Both nights the servers were great!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Hot House at least 10 times over the past few years, as it's close to the office.  Every time someone suggests going to the Hot House, I cringe.
I've tried their burgers, lasanga, spaghetti, carbonera, just about everything on theiir lunch menu.  

You can't say their food is bad.  However, regardless of what you order, everything tastes the same.  Full of garlic and overly salted.  The pasta (which is what they are known for) is way too heavy; the sauce overly rich.  And you feel as though you've put on 5 pounds for food that wasn't that good.

We sometimes term this restaurant the 'gas house' - always a bad feeling of indigestion afterwards, and it's every time.  Regardless of what I order, I feel sick afterwards.

The servers are extremely professional and well-trained, but unfortunately you can't eat service!  The portions are large, but the prices are to match."}
{"text":"I want to be honest and confess one thing.

It has been over 2 weeks that I visited Hot House Cafe and its blueberry scones still calls to me everyday.

If I comment about nothing else. Not the service (superb), the food (glory goodness!) or their overall ambiance (jazz and dripping candles!) - I must confess that I would revisit HHC... just for the scones.

This review was strictly for the scones (10/10)."}
{"text":"I came to Hot House with a friend over the holidays. We both weren't really hungry and just wanted a simple meal. Hot House was perfect - it had that Christmas vibe, warm and welcoming feel and the menu items were reasonably priced. Pasta and pizza around $12-16, latte and smoothies around $4, wine and cocktails around $8-10. My friend ordered a glass of red while I got the blueberry and elderflower martini...to be honest we were both a little disappointed as we felt the portion was less than what a typical glass would be. We ordered a pizza to split with salami, sausage and sweet sausage... It came split in half for us already. As much as it was a kind gesture, I'd have preferred to have the pizza come as a whole so I could take a nice picture. We didn't expect much and wanted just something simple that wouldn't break the bank. Ambience was important as we wanted to catch up in a comfortable environment. Overall it was a good place for that and we appreciated that we could take our time there. I heard Hot House has the best brunch in the city so I hope to try it next time! The restaurant donates their food generously to Second Harvest charity which I think is wonderful. Happy holidays nomming!"}
{"text":"They do not deliver FYI.  I have now called seven days in a row to confirm.  Every day they say they \"can't deliver today\". It's an ok place.  Food is somewhat decent.  Would definitely keep it in the rotation.  Just don't consider it a delivery option."}
{"text":"Great menu. Nice interior. Good ambience. The lobster pasta was delicious. very good service. Lots of space and didn't have to wait at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I hit the Hot House instead of getting room service at our downtown hotel during our in-town getaway.  Yes, it's a gigantic place, and it does feel a bit suburban - but a really nice suburb! The service was a bit hit-and-miss, with my mimosa never appearing, but I suppose it's not that strange for a buffet. 

Everything I had was delicious, my husband adored his to-order omelette, and the selection was mind-boggling.  Not a hip joint, but a nice place to take your parents or a girlfriend for a low-key splurge."}
{"text":"Hot House Cafe is somewhat of a landmark in the St. Lawrence Market.  For those of us without lavish corporate expense accounts - this is one of the places to go to grab a bite to eat.

It has quite the buzz for its brunch buffet, and a huge patio in the summer time.  The restaurant itself is quite spacious inside as well.  

I came here with co-workers as one of them was leaving the company.  We were a bit pressed for time and informed our server of such.  He was quick to take our orders, but everything slowed right down after that.  The wait for the food seemed long and I think that our respective definition of \"time-constrained\" was like the North and South Pole.  But the theory I came up with is this: If you're not a regular here, don't expect stellar service.  

We did manage to get a spot right next to the windows which was a nice second to sitting outside, but it was too cold.

The decor is nothing fancy.  The menu is quite extensive, but like the decor - nothing fancy.  

I opted for the Fruitti di Mar pizza ($14.95 + $1.50 for multigrain crust) which had shrimp and scallops atop a bed of pesto sauce with red peppers and Asiago.  It was quite a yummy pizza, though I could not ignore the oily-ness of the filling.  I could probably swim a lap or two in it!  I know pizzas are not healthy, and yes they're oily - but this was overly so.

My coworkers ordered the Gnocchi ($10.95 for a small) and a Warm Chicken Salad ($11.95).  The salad was a generous portion and the gnocchi looked creamy and delicious.

I would probably eat here again, though definitely not if I want to grab a quick bite to eat.  The service here is pretty lacklustre but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here for my program graduation dinner, and it was pretty alright. Cushy cozy restaurant, quick and attentive service, decent food (nothing outstanding but nothing bad either!). My night was memorable because of the event itself - Hot House was a good venue!"}
{"text":"Great food ... Great service.. 
My son chose this place for his birthday celebration. I was pleased !!
The food was quite tasty and I especially enjoyed the pasta that my better half ordered. My salad was fresh and very flavorful as well. The atmosphere was very friendly and the place was clean. I would recommend this place! 
By the way our server was very friendly very able.."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful spot. The service was great, prompt, and smooth. The manager was very active overseeing things and did take the time to come and check on us to see how things were. He even was able to say goodbye on our way out. 

Parking was only $10 nearby underground. 

We ordered a the frutti di mare pizza to start and it was a decent light starter. I then mulled over a number of choices and our waitress was helpful in giving her opinion. I went with the wild boar bolognese which was a large portion, filling, and tasty. My girlfriend ordered a beet salad that was filling as well. Dessert we both highly recommend the caramel apple slice which came with ice cream and was quite tasty. 

Overall the night was very smooth and the meal filling and tasty. The ambience was pleasant and I'd much rather prefer a venue like this that a conversation is easy to have versus a place pumping music all night. 

Definitely recommend the spot as it was a hop skip and a jump from the Sony theatre. 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"The Hot House is known for its award-winning weekday buffet and it did deliver - to a certain extent.  

I went on a Wednesday night with a large crew of food adventurers.  Although we were a large group, the service was always prompt and the servers were very hospitable.  This is a quality that I think is lacking at many other buffet restaurants, so it is a definite plus in my book.  

As for the food, the selection is Italian themed, so you will find several pastas and pizza dishes.  The highlight of the selection was the mussels, as many of my colleagues relished platefuls of nothing but these sea creatures. Personally, however, the mussels were not spectacular; they were well-cooked but lacked any strong flavour to be memorable.  Additionally, the foods were replenished quicker than what you would normally see at other buffets, which suggested that  the dishes are generally fresher here. However, the caveat was that the selection was small. For example, there was only one type of pizza, two types of meat (roasted beef and chicken), one type of soup, three types of pastas, one type of rice, and two types of hot vegetable dishes besides what was available at the salad bar.  Even ice cream/sorbet, a drink bar, and vegetarian hot foods - all of which are general features of a buffet - were non-existent!    To give some visual-spacial perspective, the salad bar, hot foods, and dessert bar are tucked into a corner of the restaurant, matching up to about a third of the size of the food areas at larger buffet chains.  Of course,  Hot House doesn't exclusively serve buffet fare, so a smaller selection is to be expected. However, I would have appreciated at least a second soup and some frozen dessert options with which to end my meal.  

Please don't get me wrong though; I did enjoy some of the food. The dessert bar was made up of six or more varieties of cakes, many of which were cheesecakes.  The two or three that were sponge cakes were not dry and hard like what you would normally get elsewhere, so I easily filled myself up with strawberry shortcake and raspberry cake.  If you're not a cake person, they also have apple crumble, though without any ice cream on-site to pair with it, it may be underwhelming. 

Overall, my experience here was decent.  The service was phenomenal and the price was fair. It's a great place to eat at with family and friends as well. However, because the selection of foods is so limited, I do not believe I will dine here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was with my grade 8 class after we visited the Hockey Hall of Fame. I remember the good times we had here and years later I returned a few more times. 

On one occasion, I had the Penne alla Sambuca, which was really scrumptious. The portion size was quite large and satisfying. It came with bacon, chicken, vegetables and a sauce similar to a penne a la vodka cream sauce.

Recently, I came here for the Sunday buffet brunch to celebrate my friend's birthday with a large group. Was it ever busy with families, couples and groups of friends. 
Someone in our group who is a vegan wanted to order from the regular menu, but was told it wasn't permissible and everyone had to partake in the buffet lunch. However, there were plenty of options for her and she was happy. 

Even though there is a smorgasbord of selections to choose from, none of the items were good quality, so I was less than impressed.  There is a  meat carving station, a wide variety of Asian, Italian, and continental cuisine to choose from. I would possibly be back for dinner, but wouldn't recommend the brunch. If you do decide to go for Sunday brunch, you can enjoy live jazz music."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for their Sunday brunch. The food, the amount of choices, and the service -- none of it disappoints! 

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that we were seated so far away from the jazz band that we couldn't hear them play at all unless we were on our way to the buffet. But when we were at our table the music was impossible to hear over all the conversations."}
{"text":"Hot House is a place I would go to again if I was in the area, but will probably not be a place that I'd actively go downtown for, unless it was the designated meeting place.

Their wait-staff is friendly, the tables, chairs and floor seemed clean, the food was fresh and appetizing, and the live band wasn't so loud to make it impossible to listen to your table-mates.

Shamefully, I did not have the cappelletti; though I was told, by those in the know, that it was The Best.  My plate was already full by the time I got to this dish, and even though I had every intention of trying it on the Second Round, I didn't score a second plate of brunch.  

Yes, as a lover of all things buffet, this was truly disheartening.

I made the buffet-for-beginners' mistake of piling up on rice; and delicious as it is, that starch will end you.  And this is why I couldn't go for that second plate.  My bad.

The food I had tried was good though. The vegetables were crisp, and cold.  The pasta salads seemed fresh, and the hot dishes were just on the cusp of lukewarm, which is about all you can ask for in a buffet styled meal.

For dessert, there aren't a lot of cakes that I can eat (with that finicky intolerance to all purpose flour), so even the assortment of sliced cake was tempting, I had their crumbly apple crumble instead.  The apples themselves did taste fresh, which is obviously a good thing; as there's nothing worse than *knowing* you're eating canned apples for dessert.  

We didn't see any ice cream, which thinking of it now, is usually a staple for buffets; even sushi buffets know this rule, with their limited selection of Green Tea, Red Bean or Mango ice cream desserts.  But somehow Hot House had missed the day in class that covered \"Iced Desserts: Creams, Milks, and Alternatives\" (Chapter 4 of Buffet Staples for Beginners.)

Word of wise though: even though whip cream kinda looks like vanilla ice cream in the most basic sense, and tastes just a sweet (if not sweeter), whip cream on top of apple crumble does not a yummy dessert make."}
{"text":"Pros: Accommodated group of 12 within a few days notice, very good food, prices correspond to food received, generous portions, quick service, service was friendly.

Cons: Decor was nothing to write home about.

Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went to their place for a Summerlicious dinner. The lobster fettuccine was fantastic. The server was nice, but the service was a bit slow. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here for a retirement party lunch today. Absolutely fabulous service. The waitress kept refilling my hot water. Very attention and friendly service.

In terms of the pasta, I don't like tomatoes sauce and they are very accommodating and changed it to cream sauce. It was tasty and there were tiny bits of anchovies that gives it a good kick.

Food and service have improved so much since the last time I came here for lunch. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Really good! The lobster risotto is amazing! Probably the best I have ever had :) a pleasant environment and decent service"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch after STWM 2017 great food and selection, fresh and quick turn items, friendly staff, busy place, cost is reasonable for a buffet place"}
{"text":"It's so good. I was looking for a winterlicious restaurant and surprisingly found this one. With $25, I have a seafood chowder, bolognese, new york cheese cake and a cocktail.  Very good!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot. 

Had to book lunch on a patio for a group of 30 for work. Hot House was one of the only reasonably priced that would accommodate. I'd never been and was nervous which was unnecessary because it ended up being fantastic.

It was gloomy out and they called to confirm and asked if we wanted to be moved inside. 

Everyone's food looked and tasted amazing. They were so on top of everything and although it took a while to get the food out, when it came it was hot and came out basically all at the same time.

The venue is nice and clean and I can't stop raving about it.

I got the gnocchi and the smoked Old Fashioned. Totally worth it. I tried my friends calamari. Amazing."}
{"text":"The manager / owner of this restaurant is atrocious. The food is sub-par. I wouldn't recommend eating here. There are much nicer places on Market St. just one block over."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch with the family today. Food was excellent for all of us as well as the service from our server but it took forever to get our food...otherwise I would have rated it a 5 out of 5. Would definitely go back as the prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but after two visits, I can't say I'm pleased.

My first visit was during Winterlicious with my cousin two years ago, which we collectively agreed was an ordinary meal.

My most recent visit was for their Sunday brunch, which my cousin said was amazing. And knowing my cousin, she wouldn't exaggerate over something like food.

I also took my cousin's advice in making a reservation. Thankfully I did, and we were able to bypass those restlessly waiting in the holding area. I could feel their eyes piercing through me as me and my friend were seated immediately.

After sitting down, we were told about their buy-one-get-one free mimosa special. Sold! Shortly after, we asked where the buffet was and we were directed to the general direction. We turned the corner, and let out an, \"Oh...\" I guess I hyped myself up thinking it'd be a Vegas-style brunch based on the size of the restaurant and the raving reviews.

There wasn't much of a selection, to which my friend suggested that perhaps they've refined their menu. Nope, just as ordinary as the Winterlicious dinner. The highlight for me was the salad station of all things, but that alone isn't enough for me to give this place a third chance."}
{"text":"my kid wanted to try an all you can eat.  I'm generally not a fan of them but I thought I'd let him try it as a treat.  We went Easter Sunday $23.95 for adults and $12 for 10 & under.  So not too bad.  the selection was adequate:  the usual omelette bar, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns for breakfast plus sweet stuff, waffles & french toast.  There were decent salads quinoa and wheat berry.  A meat server slicing up Roast beef & ham, plus there was bbq chicken.  I was surprised at the lack of italian food as I thought it was italian and there was lasagne plus tortelini stuffed with cheese in rose sauce that was pretty good.  The favouriite for most of us were the mussels though. Very tasty sauce though the mussels themselves were small. Other seafood was the poached salmon.   They had a moroccan style lamb and black bean noodles...both of which seemed kinda out of place.  Lots of desserts.  
My kid only had one plate...LOL after all that.  oh well...It's not something I'd do often but it was decent enough and not crowded either.    They can accommodate large groups so I thought that was a bonus and where we sat it wasn't too noisy and we were close to the buffet.   overall, not bad especially if you have a large group with varied tastes."}
{"text":"5 of us went here for our New Year's Eve dinner. It was a last minute decision as our previous reservation at another restaurant did not work out as planned. We were set with Italian and there weren't many openings for the time slot we wanted. I was skeptical after seeing the restaurant's logo in a picture but its opentable page stated that it has a \"smart casual\" dress code as opposed to \"casual\" in all the other restaurants. I wanted to dress up a little for New Year's Eve so I picked this restaurant over the other ones. Well, it didn't take long until I realized the restaurant does not reinforce such a dress code and nobody felt the need to dress up a little at this restaurant (must be that sign at the front). Everyone else wore t-shirts and such, and our group looked over dressed even though we only wore casual business-like attire. ._.;

The food was alright. Nothing special, but at least there isn't anything we can complain about. Our waiter was friendly and kind of cool :D but the lighting inside is really dim for a restaurant.

We finished our meal and left without any complains but neither were there anything to rave about. It is an okay restaurant, but we will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at the Hot House Cafe, complete with live jazz, is akin to Special Turkey Dinner Night at my 86-year-old grandmother's all-Hungarian people old folks' building. But without the 100% Hungarian requirement. 

I don't get it. 

On the one hand, I've been for dinner, and I know the menu is....meh.....so why should I be surprised that the brunch is lesser even, then \"meh\"?
 
Perhaps because it's often touted as one of the best brunches in the city, which is both appalling and embarrassing. It's basically \"The Mandarin\" but with breakfast foods. It's such an odd, weird mish-mash of cuisine, not unlike the meal of various coloured foams in the movie \"Hook\". 5 points if you recall what it is I speak of. To where the points apply, I have no idea. But if you're competitive with yourself, go for it. 

Anyway, they had a mimosa special, 2 for $9. That's decent. Even more decent if, after ordering the mimosas, they show up. 

I headed for the buffet. And let me add this; I was an overweight child and young adult. I KNOW how to buffet. There's a line of code in my DNA dedicated to strategic buffet planning, implementation and execution of buffet strategy, etc. You head for the \"good\" stuff to get your moneys' worth- whatever the gigantic meat offering is, the cheese and the dessert. All the rest is filler which you reserve for plates 2 and 3, respectively. 

At $19.95 per head, I find the buffet's offerings slim and strange. The first offerings are a table of breads; muffins, croissants, bagels, etc. And then dessert immediately follows that table. Why? Why oh why? Dessert comes last. Or sometimes it's plate #3 (on a dinner sized plate, not those shitty dessert sized plates) and then you follow up it with some carbs. I like to use the dessert shift as a palette cleanser, of sorts. 

There is no salad bar, but rather some potato-type salad, some quinoa-type salad and a bunch of other weird non-salad salads. Then a gigantic salmon. Then the weirdest selection of hot foods; meat, mussels, cheese cappelletti, tofu stir-fry, some kind of chicken legs....are you getting weirded out yet? And then all the traditional breakfast offerings; scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and smashed potatoes (another interesting choice) and a custom omelette bar. 

Basically, the Hot House buffet seems to strive to cater to too many a person. It's like they had too many ideas and got over-excited, like when Homer decided to build a website and ended up having every kitschy, tacky chotchka on it (Dancing Jesus, Y2K Countdown, you name it). 

I think the buffet needs some serious revising. Oh, and more staff, always helpful. 

Sorry Hot House, I love a good buffet, but this one misses the mark. 

The decent things- you CAN make a reservation, even for the coveted Sunday brunch, they replenish everything on the buffet frequently, you might rope yourself a slick old Dude for your new BF."}
{"text":"I like Hot House. It gives me the option of stuffing my face with embarrassing quantities of good food rather than mediocre food. The \"award-winning\" Sunday brunch buffet is what I came for and I must say, the food quality justifies the price. Both are pretty damn high! (~$25)

Onto the food itself, I didn't find there to be that much variety but this is brunch after all. What it does have, it does very well. Omelette bar with fancy ingredients? Uhh...yes please! Cake cutting station with 10 different cakes? Pile it on! Not only did the food taste fresh, you can SEE some of it being freshly made (like waffles). Gotta love the mussels in white wine, the crab salad, and the mixed berry white chocolate cake. 

I also have to give shout-outs to the waitstaff, who are some of the most attentive and professional around. Within 2 minutes of us noticing our table was wobbly, a polite man came up and said \"Here sir (to my dad), let me fix that for you!\" without us even asking. I saw someone ask a random person carrying dishes away whether or not a certain dish was vegan and not only were they responsive, they were actually very helpful! Major props to the amazing training at Hot House. 

Was it worth the trip downtown? Yes, just this once, but I probably wouldn't do it again. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in the area though. Highly recommended for those who are in the mood to eat until your pants protest.

{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious (dinner) today with 2 friends and it was just amazing. I wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it was because it was only $25. 

Let's start with restaurant itself:
It was my first time here and I expected a small, quiet, \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurant. To my surprise it was quite large and beautifully decorated. It had a very nice view and a lot of natural light. My friends who don't usually go downtown were just mesmerized by the view of the city. But to most it might not be all that special. Nonetheless, still very nice. 

The service:
I had a really nice waiter whose name I can't remember. He was very patient with us seeing as how it took us a bit long to decide what we wanted. He constantly checked up on us throughout the meal and he was very welcoming. He even brought us bread at the beginning which wasn't on the menu. He catered to our every need. 

The food:
Since it we ordered from the winterlicious menu, we each got an app, a main, and dessert. I had the caesar salad to start which was good considering I usually don't like Caesar dressing. The croutons were also very nice. For the main I had the \"surf and turf\" which was a 10oz steak (which is what attracted me to the restaurant!), a jumbo shrimp, seasonal vegetables, with a choice or mashed/baked potatoes, fries, or rice I believe. I had the fries. I asked for a rare steak and one of my friends ordered a blue steak and they were cooked to perfection. Most places tend to over cook it when asked for blue or rare. The fries were also very good; not too salty which I find is usually the case.  I'm not a fan of shirmp but it was a nice touch. The flavours on it were very good. For dessert we all had the creme brûlée . It was my first time trying creme brûlée and I must say it left a good first impression for it. It had a crisp top and coconut flakes. 

Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely go back whether or not it's winterlicious."}
{"text":"Quite pleased with my experience here the other day.  I think it is excellent value; I've paid more at other places and gotten far less.

The space is large, tasteful, and has a nice open flow.  We were a pair, but there were a number of larger groups and I'd be happy taking a bunch of friends here.  The waiters are polite, competent, and well dressed.  Overall, it feels dramatically more refined than other places at a similar affordable price point.  The eggs florentine were delicious.  The egg was perfectly poached with a core of hot yolk surrounded by a nice orange partially firm layer.  The hollandaise was light and served in just the right amount, with a few strands of chive on top.  The truffled spinach was delicious, not soaked in truffle essence.  Home fries were hot, lightly sautéed in olive oil with some roasted red pepper, a welcome change from the standard greasy variety you get at most brunch places that treat the sides as a throwaway."}
{"text":"Have been here twice with large groups and can say that they can offer, consistently, average food with average service. Doesn't quite offer the authentic Italian experience for its price point.

Must admit the one good discovery is their roasted beet salad with chèvre. The goat cheese comes all warm and crusted with nuts...mmmm."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch buffet.  They take reservations.  I don't even think they take walk-ins.  The cost of the brunch buffet is $24.95 per person.  They also have a dinner buffet on Wednesdays for $23.95 per person.

We missed our reservation after 15 minutes.  They tried to accommodate us, but it took over an hour to be seated.  It is very busy.  Tour buses come here.  The place was packed!

After all that wait, there is also a wait to get the food.  The line ups to the buffet were extremely long.  The space for the buffet was L-shaped, narrow and small.  Everyone was going one way in the line up with no breaks, so if you wanted to bypass the bread section because you don't want any to get to the cake section, it would seem like you're butting in.  This is the downside to the space layout.  There is a bar area where you can purchase alcoholic drinks to the right, just before the entrance to the buffet area.

Food was great overall though, with a few misses.  The selection is something to boast about. They have a variety of fresh bread, waffles, cakes, strawberry sauce, whipped cream, cheese, tasty glass noodles salad, salads were tasty and looked fresh.  There were mussels, roast beef, salmon and tasty chicken legs.  They had scrumptious pork sausage, rice, potatoes.  The down side, the scrambled eggs weren't that good and the chicken sausage was too hard to actually eat.   They have a make your own omelette section which I didn't try.  You can order mimosas, coffee, soft drinks or fruit juice.  The coffee comes with free refills, however, based on the waitress coming by, you will probably only have one cup of coffee.

The waitress was friendly enough, but did not come around often.  It was understandable considering how busy it was in there.

To add to the ambiance, there was a band playing.  They were very good and really made the brunch enjoyable.  They started a little later, approximately at 1:00 pm.

Come here if you want a good selection of breakfast and lunch items.  I really enjoyed the salads, cheese and bread selection.  The mussels, salmon, chicken and pork sausage were my favourites for the hot meal portion.  The waffles with whipped cream, strawberry sauce tasted like funnel cake (no ice cream available though).  I also enjoyed the band playing.  

Take note that you must be patient if you want to eat here."}
{"text":"I really like Hot House Cafe. Love how you can watch your salads being prepared in the middle of one of the seating areas so you know it's fresh. Jazz Brunch of Sundays is only fair by comparison. Of course, having lived in New Orleans we have a completely different rendition of what a Jazz Brunch should be like. So I'm jaded. Decor is fantastic and I usually end up here. Especially with the Dominion next door."}
{"text":"Really solid 1/5. I know a lot of folks on Yelp have diverse tastes and often rate based on their general impressions on the staff, ambiance, price, food, etc as a package deal- so this is how I'm rating this place.

I'm going to say right off the bat: you can tell by the manager's attitude here that they're certainly making more than enough money without your business. They make it clear that they don't give a shit how you feel about your dining experience- and I guess that's between them and the owner.

The food is probably about as good as Golden Griddle- so it's alright, but nothing spectacular. It's too bad the crowding and the wait times for your meal are much longer and it costs a lot more. So basically, you're paying extra money for a bit less convenience. Even at off hours, the service here is atrocious.

All that said, I doubt my review will deter many people from wasting their time and money at this joint. If I can save one soul a few hours of their lives and $40, I'll die a happy man."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. They serve a quality brunch, but it's not noteworthy. If you simply want brunch, you won't go wrong here.

I'm not a fan of the jazz they have going, but on-site live music is something I'm picky about and I suspect most people rather like it. In any case, I found it a bit difficult to have a conversation.

The staff were polite and courteous.

The food was good, but again it was neither spectacular nor unique. I was a bit mislead when told I'd find good brunch here, as there was both breakfast food (omelettes made -- to order -- in front of you, fruits, waffles, breads, scones, sausage and bacon, etc...) as well as proper dinner selections like lasagna, roast beef, fish, a variety of green and non-green salads, barbeque chicken, and so on. I have no complaints about the food, and if you want a good bunch place, choosing here is very much guaranteed satisfaction.

My major disappointment is that I wasn't receptive to the mood, but that's not for lack of their trying. Again, if you are one for soft jazz, you'll love it here.

As an aside, their raspberry lemonade is particular ace."}
{"text":"This past weekend, I participated in a work function that had me enjoy a dinner with my colleagues here. Our reservation was for 7 PM and we were seated right away. As soon as everyone was seated, servers came out with appetizers and various wines. 

Individually, I ordered the house salad and a BBQ chicken pizza. The house salad comes with a house dressing, which I found to be quite nice. It wasn't too heavy. The BBQ chicken pizza was quite hot, but it was still enjoyable. For dessert, the tiramisu was served. It was absolutely delicious. 

I had a positive experience at the Hot House, but I can't say that the food or even the experience was ingrained into my memory. My memory of my Saturday night would be the fact that I got to know my colleagues better, which has nothing to do with the Hot House. In other words, I'll be okay if I don't come back here."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day and ordered the following from the winterlicious menu:
crab cake, chicken & goat cheese ravioli, and cheese cake for dessert. 
The food was okay. The crab cakes were probably the tastiest part of the meal and I could have eaten a whole plate of them! They were fried, not too dry or too crumbly. Not salty at all as I often find crab cakes have too much salt added to them. Definitely a good crab cake. The ravioli was okay. I couldn't really taste the goat cheese or even notice the chicken as it was overpowered by the pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese. The cheese cake was good but the slice was too big of a portion, The service was a tad bit slow but I guess that is expected during the winterlicious event!"}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day and I know the food is great and filling and somewhat pricey but I knew I'd get my money's worth.

ONLY thing is is that the waiter kept coming by and asking us for our order and I felt rushed and uncomfortable: people have to give you some time especially when your spending time with your significant other. Please and thank you =)"}
{"text":"BF took me here for a surprise brunch date. We made reservations the day before so we expected to get seated on time. 

When we got there we did not get seated until maybe 40 mins later...paid parking might as well have been expired. The staff seems to not really know what to do about the crowd building up. There does not seem to be a good flow for those that have reservations. When we got seated, our waitress did not seem to care for refilling our waters or really engaging us whatsoever. The food is good, the omelette station can be a long line. I would have liked if there was more brunch food selection and also the dessert cakes were served in a tiny sliver of a slice to each person. But I understand because they don't want food wasted. 

Coffee and tea not included. Would have been nice to have a self serve coffee/tea station in the buffet area."}
{"text":"One of THEE best and consistent buffets I've been to in an extremely long time. Hubby and I came here during our honey moon and we were blown away at all of the tasty food options. The live music was awesome and the fresh fruit drinks were delish!! This place was spacious and clean. The salmon was awesome! I had this delicious seafood salad that I just could not stop eating. My hubs was all over the waffles (which a line was formed just to get to). And not to mention all of this for a low price of what I think was about $24.99. Will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"It's \"Reunion Time\"! It's interesting how certain people draw you to certain places! The girls from work and I use to go here on lunch runs. We always order the cheese cappelletti and pizzas. But that was a few years ago. Now I'm back in town and it's catchup time with the girls on a late Saturday morning at 11! 

By this time, I have already eaten brekky, but who says I can't have a SECOND brekky? =P  ... I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine; two poached eggs on top of mini muffins topped with creamy spinach and oozing with hollandaise sauce, with a side of your choice (home fries or fresh fruit). Delish! Good portion size, decent price ($11.95 w/o tax or tip), filling and tasty and really hit the spot! 

Tip: You can get gluten-free alternatives for $1.50 extra. I didn't try it, but my friend ordered the pizza and got it gluten free, which she seemed to have enjoyed.

This was my first Saturday here. If you come on Saturdays, service is impeccable! The waiter was always poking around the corner, almost eagerly filling up our coffee and water! And we when asked for the bill, it almost magically appeared in our hands.

I've also been here for dinner and SUNDAY Brunch. Dinner was Meh. But BRUNCH BUFFET on Sundays is GRRRRRRREAT! It's $19.95 per person, plus tax. (no drinks included). Reservations are highly recommended.  There are 4 buffet stations ( Hot food / Salad & Cheese & Fruit / Omlette / and Dessert). The ambiance on Sundays is lively, as the air is filled with a live band! 

Warning: if you do not have reservations for Sunday's brunch, waiting time is nasty (or is that ME cuz I hate waiting for food when I'm hungry?). But it is absolutely worth the wait! For the quality & selection of food, it is almost a steal! 

Great for groups, big or small.

{"text":"The first time I came here was for sunday brunch with the famjams, and a whole lot of others. It was an okay experience.

They have the awesome buffett which was plentiful, but all the food tasted a bit bland to me.

But I've been back here a few times for their regular menu, and I do like it. 

I've had the:

Frutti De Mare (sp?) pasta - Mixed seafood. It was all good, I found the scallops and the squid to be a touch overdone

Jambalaya - I really liked it. Wasn't spicy though. White people I swear! *shakes fist*

I might be back here soon, I'm usually in the area. 

I'm always down for the brunch buffett, but get a reservation in bro!"}
{"text":"I went here after planning for awhile.  It was for the Wednesday night buffet.  At first, I had a pretty good experience and the staff at the door were quite nice.  The food wasn't amazing but it was a nice buffet. Ultimately, I got super sick after I left.  Their quality of food might be lower end...

Food: 2/5, buffet choices weren't a lot and it was secluded in the restaurant. I had to walk quite a bit to get there.  Desserts were probably the best part of the buffet.

Service: 2/5, not great for buffet service. We had to ask for water often and there was too much \"are you done with your plate\".

Ambience: 3/5, nice looking restaurant 

Price: 2/5, hard to find good buffets these days but not sure if it was worth $25 here. I'd rather go to Mandarin."}
{"text":"Hot house...kept getting this name confused with Heart House (which is at UofT!).

I went here with a group-around 40 or so. This is a big restaurant with multiple seating options, including a meeting room (which we didnt use but it looked nice with windows lining it). In fact, there seem to be windows all around-our view ended up being the metro grocer which is very close by and also has big windows. I found it quite funny to look up from my meal and see people across from us doing their regular grocery shopping.

Our waiter was very nice. Considering our group size, I appreciated his attention to each one of us at our table. 

This place reminds me of...the Beer Bistro. Something that has more of a generic appeal. A good place to bring your parents who are out-of-towners and like to keep their meals simple.

I went with just a dessert this evening (Tiramisu!) Great serving size-in fact it was so big I couldn't finish it. I noticed everyone else had quite large serving sizes too. Meals were around $15-20, the pastas looked very rich. 

Once again, I will have to come back to give this place a full review of their food. I heard this is 'the' brunch spot in the city, so likely will come back for that."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and glad we did! The food and service was amazing. Cajun calamari was excellent. Drinks were also great. There is nothing bad to say about this place. 

Our waiter was friendly and cared for us. We visited on vacation from the US and he provided great recommendations."}
{"text":"The black olive tapenade (part of the Mediterranean trio sharing platter) was a lot less salty this time, so was actually edible. Even my partner finished his share of this spread. The grilled naan was again lovely - very slightly burnt from the grill (you can imagine it to be from a tandoori lol), but aromatic and soft.

I tried their pasta for the first time! Yes, goodbye low carb streak. I've been craving Italian food lately, so why not start at this less than authentic Italian/hodgepodge of cultures place in my hood. I ordered the lunch size ($17) pescatarian-friendly Puttanesca, featuring big juicy scallops and shrimp in a non-cream-based tomato and EVOO sauce with cherry tomatoes, small black olives, capers, and anchovy in the sauce. I loved the seafood medley and thought the lunch size was perfect (though I could only eat a bit over half since I didn't like the pasta). My main criticism was the pasta - it was tagliatelle, so supposed to be larger width, chewy egg pasta that remains firm even when bathed in heavy sauces. However, the Hot House version did not have a chewy texture at all, got soggier by the second in the tomato sauce, and tasted like grocery store pasta. Not sure if I want to order pasta here anymore. 

My partner ordered the dinner size Cappelletti ($18), little pasta pockets filled with 3 cheeses (ricotta, mozarrella, and Romano) baked in a creamy cheese sauce. Very heavy, very caloric. The dinner portion was definitely way bigger than it needs to be - typical North American lack of portion control. Also, no vegetables! Sad.

Bill for 2 came to around $67 including tip."}
{"text":"Solid date night place. 10/10... errr, 5/5.. oops, sorry yelp.

Perfect place to wine and dine your significant other. The service is top notch and fancy; everything came very quickly and they didn't come ask if you were doing ok every 2 seconds and when he was here, he'd somehow find the perfect timing so he'd barely disrupt us. 

Tons of vegan friendly options here, marked clearly with a V. I had the asian stirfry, which impressed me - and I'm asian! The sauce on it was mixed well and delicious with the abundance of veggies and rice. (you can add shrimp/chicken too) It was mouthwatering and I wanted to stuff my face over and over again. Dining partner got the filet mignon and not being a meat eater myself, I can say it looked delicious. Came with potatoes and veggies too, nom.

There's a nice wine selection there and we got 1/2L of a red wine.. forgot the name, but it was amazing. Perfect sipping and chatting about inappropriate things kind of wine. That's my kind of wine. 

Prices aren't ridiculous either. I'm a fan, I'm a fan, I'm a fan!

.. Also, all these reviews mention brunch... hmmmmm. I need to get on that."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table that had bird crap right in the middle. I had to ask them to clean it.

Water wasn't offered and had to ask for it. The wait for two thin crust pizza was 18 minutes.

Pizza tasted good. However, later during the day we had stomach problems."}
{"text":"Hot House Penne was amazing!  The peppers, penne, sauce and vegetables in this dish was great!  

Ambiance: swanky
Dress: Casual 
Good for happy hour and dinner"}
{"text":"The name and the sign are confusing since at first glance, I believed the location to be a strip club for up-and-comers but I was wrong, way wrong. The location is ideally situated, at the corner of Church and Wellington and for lunch, the place is delightful without being too stuffy or bohemian for that fact. Service was prompt and friendly and you can actually have a conversation in this place without it being overbearing because of the noise. The food was good, I had the jambalaya and it was well presented and tasted good. In fact, this could become my goto restaurant. I wonder if the action changes after 11:00 pm. Hmmm."}
{"text":"We just went for Winterlicious 2017. It was a incredible experience. I order the aracini, followed by the short rib meatball and ended it off with Nutella creme brûlée. Wow!! I couldn't believe how amazing everything tasted. The restaurant is clean and at a great location. The staff was soooooo friendly! Everyone greeted us and thanked us from beginning to end. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"first and last visit. went for lunch with co-worker. ordered Il Diavolo pizza and Margherita pizza(switching to pesto sauce) with sweet potato fries at 1:15pm got our drinks and then our waitress disappeared. when i noticed that it was 1:55pm and we had not seen our waitress much less for the food, we flagged down another waitress, explained and then waited some more. 2nd waitress came with pizzas and 1st waitress coming up behind with fries. Was told that it was only 23mins(not true, and 23 minutes for 2 personal thin pizzas?). 1st waitress stated that it was so long cause of the pesto change? really? did they have to go to Italy for the pesto? Asked for the manager, explained to him the situation and that we have no time to eat. he said he would give us 20% off....really...food should have been compted! then all of a sudden 1st waitress was super attentive....no, we do not want water, nothing else, we are going to get indigestion from scarfing down our food. Btw....my pizza was cold and dripping with oil.....gross. Waitress came by with the bill, walked away, and not five mins later, came back and opened the bill to see if we had left anything.....RUDE & IGNORANT. Needless to say, no tip(and i always tip, no matter how bad the service) and will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and skip the winterlicious menu come here instead on Sundays for all you can eat brunch or breakfast. The food is much better and it's all you can eat. Don't let that fool you the food is terrific. I love the pastas and me at a that are served everything tasted fresh and delicious I was overstuffed on the meals. The seating area was a bit crazy as I'm sure everyone knows to come here during brunch. I really enjoyed myself during the all you can eat brunch would come back for this offer only."}
{"text":"It seems most people come here for the buffet. I wish I'd known that before I spent my money on an overpriced frozen burger for dinner. I left feeling annoyed and bloated."}
{"text":"The Sunday Brunch is an institution I was raised on and the tradition continues today in my family. Birthdays, holidays, special occasions. Reasonably priced. You must experience. The food is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good restaurant that is not over the top, this is the place to be. The service was outstanding and food was great! It is not too fancy, hence the prices are not too high, which makes it an affordable place to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday. We had a party of 7 people for brunch on Saturday and all had a very enjoyable experience! The restaurant was mostly empty, so we didn't have to wait at all, unlike 99% of brunch places in Toronto. The wait staff were also extremely friendly and attentive! We're a pretty rowdy bunch and our waiter humoured us and laughed at our jokes.

The food was okay. Very standard brunch fair. Amongst our table, we tried almost every item on their menu and I would say that the ham and cheese omelette was the most impressive dish (unfortunately, I was not able to snap a picture). The French toast was a close second. The St Lawrence Classic and Egg Benedict were nothing too special. If you are undecided between the choice of sausage or bacon for a side, definitely go with the bacon. They serve real peameal bacon with generous portions!

Our favourite part of the meal were the mimosas! They have a special where you can have two mimosas for $9! The tropical mimosas is a must try! There are other cocktails on the menu, but two for $9 really can't be beat!

I will definitely come back again for the service and atmosphere, probably on a Sunday for their brunch buffet!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the rave and reviews about the brunch buffet at Hot House, it was one of my top choices to try on a Sunday afternoon. Walking in 1:30pm without a reservation on a cold and rainy day, we expected a slow crowd, but man was I mistaken. The host informed us that the expected wait time was 1hr, but she offered 2 seats at the bar which we graciously took. Why not? You're hardly going to be sitting down for long anyways!

As we made our way towards the buffet, we were greeted with a wide variety of warm pastries, bread, and fresh fruits. Followed by hot waffles made on the spot, with choices of maple syrup, chocolate or strawberries with whipped cream to accompany. The meat station consisted of smoked ham and roast beef. 

The highlight was the omelette station, with 5-6 toppings to choose from, cooked on the spot to your liking. About a 5-10 mins wait time but well worth it!

The hot stations of the day consisted of sheppards pie, BBQ chicken, lasagna, chipotle steamed mussels, capelletti, stir fried noodles, rice pilaf. Of course, you'll have the usual scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausages. 

The dessert section was heaven for cake lovers. There were 6 cakes to choose from and all looked so delicious, but I was only able to try 2 slices. They consisted of red velvet, chocolate bananas, white chocolate, chocolate truffle, cheesecake, strawberry mouse. Oh, so good!

Service was quick and friendly. Dishes always cleared by the time I returned, water consistantly refilled. Live jazz music in the background. 

But it's definitely pricey ($19.99) for brunch fare. But worth the trip if you're a huge brunch fan.

Note: As noted, make reservations before going!"}
{"text":"I am a fan. What can I say? It's not the BEST food, nor the BEST atmosphere in the city, but we often end up back here! The location is really convenient and the food is good, as are the prices.

It's big enough that you can usually get a table/make a reservation on a holiday but small enough that it feels full and popular. Sometimes it DOES affect service, but I would say more often than not the service is good here.

This is a great place for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. The menu is large and the specials always offer a great range of new choices. They usually offer a seasonal menu insert as well, which always uses the freshest seasonal ingredients.

They just introduced a new menu at the end of July... but there's a lot of the same stuff on it. I was happy to see my favourite wild mushroom bruschetta and shrimp appetizers were both still on the menu.

I'll go through this one meal by meal...

BREAKFAST/BRUNCH: YUM!!! Like Kat, I have no idea why, but they are only open for brunch on Sundays, from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. It's a HUGE buffet with everything you can think of, and it's all great. There's an omelet station and sooo many options. Plus, live jazz! And it's all for only $18.95 - not bad!

LUNCH: A great place to meet for workplace birthday lunches, lunch with clients, etc.

DINNER: They shine here for sure. One of my favourite places to eat pre-theatre downtown, it's a perfect stop before a St. Lawrence Centre/Bluma Appel Theatre, Sony Centre, LKTYP, ACC, etc. show. Their pizzas are very yummy, but really they do everything well.

OTHER: Pretty good for cocktails & apps, but keep in mind there's no bar to sit at if you're going there for drinks. If you like girly cocktails, try the \"Berry Sparkler\": Smirnoff Citrus, Grand Marnier, crushed Blackberries, Pomegranate Blueberry Juice
and lemon-lime soda... mmmm!

The summer patio is DELIGHTFUL! This is just the weather for it too!"}
{"text":"Average. Not amazing, not terrible. Slooowwww service. We arrived and were greater by our waitress in training who obviously didn't know much about the menu or how to say any menu items for that matter. We both ordered a salad to start, but our main meal came first? Followed by the salad side by side with our meal. A bit confusing. I had to find another waitstaff to order my drinks. I'm sure our waitress was still learning but her trainer should know better and be able to teach her timing I would think. I the gnocchi which was.. Just ok, a bit over cooked and soggy. I've certainly had worse but had higher expectations from all the accolades they displayed. It wasn't cheap but not high end priced either. Probably good for a family night out where kids might not be as concerned with phenomenal flavors."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friend, food is average, wine was good, had a burger with french fries."}
{"text":"Hot house has always been a popular restaurant serving some classic dishes and notable for its Sunday Brunchs where they'd have a live jazz band playing. Located in the heart of Lawrence the place is huge with plenty of seating.
Though I've been here in the past, our last experience was painfully slow.
Ordering their classic Hot House Breakfast with pemeal bacon our group order took a long time.  After all it doesn't take THAT long to make breakfast unless everyone's order was mixed up.  However long story short, after taking advantage of their well priced 2 Mimosas deal our food finally arrived.  In terms of service we cannot blame our waitress who was always kind and attentive. 
Would I come back here, probably not as there are many other breakfast/ brunch places all over the city."}
{"text":"Really not worth your time or money. The food is overwhelmingly bland, dry, and overpriced. Service is just okay -- I wouldn't expect to get water or accompaniments for your meal. Ambience is non-existent. Anywhere else is better even the chain burger joint across the street."}
{"text":"Friendly service, although food was served rather slowly. We tasted the pastas and salads: large portion, tasty food ! A pleasant meal outside in a sunny day !"}
{"text":"I would have had great things to say about them, if they weren't so unfair. Do not go to this restaurant in a group larger than 4 b/c they will give u two hours to eat... which is ridiculous & unfair considering that 6 ppl equates to more money than 2, yet only larger groups get this unreasonable time constraint. I somehow don't think that it is legal either, especially since it's all u can eat & not all u can eat in 2 hours. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place b/c the brunch place we wanted to go had a 30 min wait. Glad we went because we were all presently surprised. I had heard about their famous Sunday brunch buffet and it definitely didn't disappoint. The variety was great (cold salmon, roast beef & ham carvery, omelet station, tons of cold and hot pasta dishes and amazing desserts) and the quality is IMO above par for buffets.

We sat in the patio because we didn't have a reservation, which I subsequently learned is must for this place (I see why). But it was perfect because it allowed us to enjoy the beautiful neighborhood. 

Will definitely go back!! FYI the price is $19.95 per person."}
{"text":"Very tasty omelettes. 
I really enjoyed their omelet with sautéed onions, mushrooms, bacon and cheese. It was delicious. 
The buffet was very clean, organized and appealing. 
The food was cooked really good. 
I was though disappointed that there was no ice cream that I could add to my waffle. 

I hate going downtown. I only did it for a birthday party. The staff did a beautiful job serving the birthday girl a slice of cake with a sparkler candle and had the jazz band play the happy birthday song. That was really nice :)"}
{"text":"We went for the Wednesday evening buffet and overall the food was very tasty. There was a good selection of different pastas, salads and desserts. My favorite part was the dessert table, although there was no ice cream, they had different kinds of cakes, cheese cakes, fruits and puddings and all were very delicious. The only downside is that there was a tour group dining when we went. It was very noisy and the entire buffet station was overly crowded. I had a reservation beforehand but was given a table very far away from the buffet all the way on the other side of the restaurant. But other than that there was nothing to complain about the food or the service. Overall I enjoyed dining there and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"it was ok. I think the boiler house on distillery is waayy better."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were looking for a lunch spot but it just snowed the night before and it was freezing so we picked the closest place we could find that wasn't Spring Rolls (we did Spring Rolls 2 days in a row lol) and Hot House it was.

It looks very chainy because of the large huge restaurant and the large menu but the food was decent.  The service was awesome as always and the portions just right.  What I've noticed from eating in Canada is that their portions are significantly smaller than the portions here in the US which probably explains why everyone in the US is disgustingly obese.

Boyfriend and I had the pizza da parma which wasn't much of a pizza at all, the crust was super thin (I opted for multigrain) and topped with a bit of cheese and on it were thin slices of proscuitto and arugula.  It was realy light and yummy.  My boyfriend ordered the tortelloni which was really tortellini stuffed with cheese and truffles in a leek tomato sauce.  It didn't come in a lunch portion but the waitress was able to get a lunch portion made for us.  Like I said, great service.

All in all it a good spot with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Grab one of the couches on the patio and order drinks."}
{"text":"I must've been here a thousand times and not even once did they dassapoint me. The food is pretty generic however (pasta, fish, salads) but it always tastes good. The pastas here are the best tasting in my opinion. The service has been consistently good as well, regardless whether i was with a group of people or just by myself. The prices are average for the downtown area"}
{"text":"This place is A-OK...  The food is pretty good but not outstanding... 
Nice place and great spot for patio when the weather is right..."}
{"text":"Pretty good casual relaxed spot in a good location.  Was here for a work Xmas party lunch so was a set menu.  Was pretty good though, better than I expected."}
{"text":"Do not get the French toast at brunch. All you can see is syrup, dates and pecans. The toast was soaked in all of the above and was not appetizing at all. It was sent back. 

The service was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gnocchi mushroom fughi. So tasty! Very heavy as expected but huge portions. Definitely value for money. Well worth the $20. This place is very reasonable priced and has great service. Our waitress as always on point and attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent stop for a Saturday night. The calamari was amazing. Bonus they serve wine from the local region. Service was excellent and top level checked in more than once. We ate on the patio but the inside also was excellent. Family- toddler friendly for a nice night out on the town."}
{"text":"Cafe here for a celebration brunch with my family. It was the perfect spot. They gave us a large table and excellent service. 

The food was remarkable! So much selection to choose from! From eggs to waffles, fruit trays to lasagna they have everything!! The quality of the food was outstanding also. 

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were there to celebrate our friends birthday party.
Went in on a saturday without a reservation.
We were pleasantly surprised to be seated in a privet room.
** The Grilled New Zealand Lamb was fantastic, my wife had the Grilled New York Strip loin, well seasoned with savory mushrooms. Garlic mash was an excellent side for both dishes along side fresh firm veggies.
*** The server (forget her name) kindly enough highlighted the gratuity, which you never see done anywhere.. This made us only leave a bit more. ***
Overall excellent staff, very hospitable and were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I try my best to not write reviews when I am emotionally charged - I give it 24 hours to cool off, so I can jot something halfway decent and objective. 6 months later, I am STILL cheesed so be warned, this may just turn into a long rant.

This is not the first time I've been to this place - I have been here at least 2 times before mostly on insistence of friends,far and few in between -which should have been a good indication that I wasn't going to be happy.. This time was no different. It was a bday dinner for a friend and probably only one that would accept such a large group (there was 12 of us I think) on short notice.

Of course I arrived fashionably late (30minutes) which the waiter kindly to point it out to me, when the food started arriving, but I am skipping forward here.

When I arrived, I was surprised that the waiter promptly asked me for my drink order, which lead me to believe that he's going to be awesome: of course not. I think I spent good 20 minutes mauling over the menu and good 20 minutes looking for my waiter. In fact, we had to go ask someone where our waiter was. Which was a bizzare, as the place was far from \"popping\"; in fact, there was one table of 5 behind us and a table of 6 or 7 to the left of us and the section was quite empty. Had I been the waiter I would be lingering around to ensure maximum satisfaction and of course, tip. Apparently the waiter and I didn't see eye to eye on this view, as finding him was like finding Waldo - Waldo was easier.

We finally order - I get an iced tea, crab cakes and something pasta. Chatter away - I go on a hunt for a last cigarette of life - and fail. I return and notice :the table left to us is constantly being attended to, and from what I understand they arrived only shortly before I, yet there they are, getting the food before us. Is it because the table consisted of men and we were a table of 12 Asian woman?and really, as a male server, shouldn't you be extra nice to the women then the men, considering we tend to tip better? WHATEVER.  I also noticed that my crab cakes have arrived which was wonderful; it was going to be GRAND after all. NOT TRUE.Our waiter simply disappear into the void  to never be found -we had to constantly  ask others where he was and each time there was no guarantee that he would reappear.

The reason for this odd behaviour was because we are large enough of a group that the tips will be included in the final bill automatically so the waiter doesn't have to work at all for it, whereas the others are just small enough that he needed to work his magic for the tip.

We  finally start to get our food; by this point the we've been waiting at least 15 full minutes since arriving. The waiter tells me upon eye contact, that my food will be coming late because I arrived late. I said, that's fine but where is my iced tea? I bit my tongue and didn't mention that my crab cakes have already arrived, so don't give me this poop about my food being late cuz I was late; I worked in service for a very long time and I can tell u otherwise , *humph*

Of course my food arrived with the food of few others who have been patiently waiting since the start, except one. And her food was a burger - probably the easiest thing to put together. We had to get a manager to figure out where that burger was and when it arrived it wasn't edible.They gave a complimentary caesar salad for her, which was nice - but she had to eat all by herself now. The cheesecake I had requested  for the bday girl was also missing.

By this point, I am thoroughly pissed off and stomp off to speak with the floor manager. What I noticed about this place- EVERY TIME I got up the staff assumed that they  knew where I was going to go. When I went on a hunt for the last cigarette the floor manager shouted the directions to the washroom to me;when I was looking for the manager they assumed I was still looking for the washroom and barked the direction to me before I can speak.

I spoke to the manager - this was an unacceptable service at any level of restaurant (I didn't know THIS was a 5 star?!price maybe)- this was supposed to be special night and it has turned into a stressful disaster. I hope he was going to comp the burger at the very least - which he apparently was going to give thought. He was going to send the cake right away though and speak to the staff. 
Few minutes later the waiter came to ask when he can bring the cake and ruined the surprise,because people were \"eating.\" I snapped to let him know that they had not touched the food for at least 10 minutes and if he could bring the cake now, that would be FABULoUs.

We did pictures. The angry birthday girl had a chat with the manager and gets a complimentary glass of wine.He said the bills would be separated - and we took that to mean that the automatic tip will not be included - but it did. OMG I can go on but there is a word limit; short end - blacklisted."}
{"text":"The one thing the Hot House Café has in its favour as its size.  It is huge.  Vast.  There are three main seating areas that house as many tables and chairs that could be found in some small size restaurants.  As such, this place not only runs buffets but also a full menu-driven food line.

Anchoring itself in Italian food, there's not much that is wrong with the menu nor is there much this stands out.  Outside of the Garlic Festival that occurs annually, the menu is fairly standard, and child and parent friendly.  You'd be hard pressed to find anything that you wouldn't want to eat on the fairly large menu that exists.  As such, it's hard to find anything that really stands out.

There are a few beers on tap and there are is a fairly decent wine list.  If its a tame evening that you're looking for without much in the way of a challenge from either the food or the wine list, there's nothing wrong with the Hot House."}
{"text":"Just when my girlfriend and I were about to give up on finding a place that was still open to have dinner in the area we were wandering, we walked past Hot House. This place seemed like a chain to me, but it's actually just this location, and we were glad that we walked in here.

We started with Capriccio Bread, and as an entree I went with the Makhani Curry Chicken. I enjoyed both dishes, and our server was very friendly and got us our food in good time. The restaurant itself, and I think it was because we came in so late, was empty except for another couple stopping by after the Blue Jays game. That was a bit worrying when we first walked in considering the size of the space, but then we realized what time it was. Overall, great food and great service paired with a nice atmosphere will have us coming back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I hit this place for lunch and it was great.  Our server was very friendly and the food was great.  We had a late lunch so I missed out on the pasta special but the server let me sub in any pasta on the menu, now that's just good customer service.  The soup of the day was a carrot, pear, and ginger which was superb, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like ginger.

The restaurant is big as is the patio so they can easily accommodate larger groups.

Overall just a great experience."}
{"text":"Had the Wednesday dinner buffet after taking some photos around St Lawrence market. To sum it up food was good but not enough variety. Unlike other buffets I was surprised it is not just drenched in oil. Ingredients tasted fresh. The mussels were amazing but unfortunately I didn't think there was enough dishes to make a good buffet."}
{"text":"After my reservation got messed up at Vagabondo for my friend's farewell party, the 8 of us ended up at Hot House Café that evening.  I was glad that they were able to seat us in less than 20 minutes (considering that it was 7:30 PM on a Saturday).

My friends and I had an amazing time that night.  Service was amazing once again.  My drink was questionable - I wasn't very pleased with the Berry Sparkler.  Next time, I'm opting for something else.

I had the penne alia sambuca.  It was fairly good and quite filling!  I couldn't even finish it because it was a huge portion.  

After a night that I thought was going to be a disaster (damn you Vagabondo), my friends had an amazing time at Hot House Café.  I would definitely suggest this place for large groups."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant downtown Toronto. Their Wednesday buffet has the most beautiful pasta bar, and you can get the same Gnocchi Gorgonzola from their menu (which, by the way is a true addiction). They never fail to amaze me. Even my fiance who is a meat and potato kind of guy was blown away by his burger. That was probably the best part. Seeing someone enjoy this place as much as I do. Thank you time and time again for the amazing drinks, atmosphere, and food."}
{"text":"Came by this restaurant with a friend for dinner last week, food was mediocre. We ordered a chipotle mussels and a chicken stir-fry."}
{"text":"We were staying nearby at the King Edward, so this spot rated 2 visits on a rainy weekend. We opted for inside, although big umbrellas and tiki torches sheltered and warmed a few outdoor guests. Window seats were great for people and weather watching.

Draft beers were all excellent, but on the second trip I opted for one of three hard ciders (can't remember the name, but it was Toronto made) on the list. It was a cold and refreshing changes and went down easy. Many excellent selections on the menu, but I've got to say that I had the world's best Jambalaya on the first visit, almost good enough to order the 2nd time, but I opted for Mongolian Beef, which satisfied my desire for Asian but was not quite what you could get in Chinatown. On the two visits, my wife had a beet and goat cheese salad and a tasty roast chicken dinner, both which she thoroughly enjoyed.

Both waitstaff and the owner stopped by frequently to check if we enjoyed everything. We did."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with a friend. Was quite happy with the Jamblaya rice. Tasty food with good portion for lunch."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to try this place on a whim. The restaurant is huge, and the decor is a little bit dated to my taste. However, the pasta was amazing. I had the Sicilian Gnocchi, and it was one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had! The price point is mid to higher range, but you do get a lot for the dinner portion."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed by the food here! Had a great experience visiting Hot House for the first time with 3 girlfriends. We came for the Sunday brunch and I was thoroughly impressed with the food, service, and overall ambience of the place. Our server was prompt and friendly, and our coffees and waters were always topped up while we spent a couple hours chatting away. We sat out on the patio on a nice Sunday afternoon so I didn't notice how busy the restaurant was until I would walk in to get food from the buffet. Despite this, it was no detriment to the service. The food was amazing, fresh and always replenished. They have a huge selection of dishes for the buffet, and not just breakfast foods. Lots of meats, salads, and pastas. I'm drooling just thinking about the tortellini and lasagna. They also have a live jazz band playing for Sunday brunch, a real classy touch! My best friend and I plan to come back for their Wednesday night dinner buffet one day, being the piglets that we are. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Dropped in last Sunday for brunch. There were 3 of us and it was 10:00am.
Hostess immediately told us that we couldn't come in as we didn't have reservations. Place was fairly empty, but I get they may have a big party booked or a large reservation list.
The manager, who happened to be walking by, told us to follow him...and he escorted us to an empty table (in the section he seated us, there were several empty tables) and told us our server would be by shortly.
Within a minute, a great server came by and took our drink order and asked if we've ever had brunch there before....and directed us to where it was located in the restaurant.
There's something for everyone...eggs, French toast, cheeses, fruits, croissants, breads, buns, salads, deli meats, roast beef, pasta's...etc. etc. It is a fairly large menu.
Food was good....nothing really stood out but nothing was dreadful either.
Would score higher is it wasn't for the hostess at the door and the fairly costly bkfst (per person its around $25...not including drinks.
Server was excellent, room was warm, fairly noisy once it got busy, but overall a good place for brunch"}
{"text":"This is strictly a review of the brunch, as I have not dined off the regular menu:

Get there early, if possible, not only to avoid waiting for a table but to also avoid long lines at the buffet tables.

The brunch is a very good bargain - at $15.95 (during our visit) you could stuff yourself for a whole day.   Fresh squeezed orange juice is very good and if you are six or more, order a pitcher or two.  We were seven and one pitcher served all of us nicely.  

Atmosphere is pleasant, somewhat canned but not objectionable.  Live soft jazz was a good brunch accompaniment.

The brunch food consists of a select-your-ingredient omelet station (be prepared to wait), a carving station (offering ham, roast beef and salmon when we were there), a bread and salad bar, a dessert bar (the chocolate cake I picked was rich but not all that well flavoured - same for the apple crumble), and a steam table bar containing hot foods and cold items.  Lasagne was very tasty, but a shrimp salad was not fresh and should have been eighty-sixed.  My partner raved about the waffles.

This is a good place for a group brunch or for a young person to take parents who have fairly conservative food preferences.  There is nothing unusual about the food but it was generally good and the variety was enormous."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Staff very attentive. Buffet brunch was great. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We ordered the prosciutto pizza, organic burger, and a custom poutine. The pizza was pretty much flatbread with arugula, the burger was great, and the gravy on the poutine was unreal. We also ordered the cappricio bread and it was amazing.
The first pitcher of beer was warm, we made a comment and they brought us a cold one. The sangria was strong with a heavy lime taste and lots of pulp. The vodka 7 drink was smooth and great.
Service was a bit slow, our waiter spilled 1/4 of our pitcher on the ground while pouring, and forgot a few times to bring our drinks.
Management was very appreciative, friendly, on the ball, and eager to please."}
{"text":"I come here because it is in a good location, but it is always either mediocre or poor experience. A bit disappointing.

Ordered the lamb burger this time. Taste like beef to me. And seems to be randomly thrown together. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday. Was extremely impressed! Their food was delicious, and their service/friendliness was amazing! Would definitely be going back! The atmosphere was incredible!"}
{"text":"Open, airy & well lit restaurant.... popped in for a quick bite & to cool down from walking around on a Saturday afternoon. ...quick didn't happen at all. For any empty restaurant, our app took long to get to us. 
We ordered the nachos with wild boar chili. It was tasty - not great. 

Enjoyed the nice jazz music playing while we ate."}
{"text":"Welcome to Summerlicious 2013. First stop, Hot House Cafe.

I came here with a friend yesterday for lunch to try their $15 prix fixe menu. I started with the soup of the day (clam chowder soup), while my friend had the crab cakes. Needless to say, I should've gotten the crab cakes...the soup was quite disappointing, since the clams just melt in your mouth, there was too much bacon, and the bread that came with it was inedible.

Both of us got the smoked chicken and goat's cheese anglotti. However, despite that, our plate sizes were different! I got a round plate, while my friend got an oval plate. The anglotti was actually quite good! There were a couple of burnt spots in my plate at least, but overall I was satisfied with it.

For dessert, I got the cheesecake while my friend had the mango sorbet. The sorbet is a large portion; be careful of that if you're too full. The cheesecake is a smaller one, and once again it tasted quite good! However I didn't think the strawberry sauce went very well with the cheesecake...

Service was quite good the whole way, however when we had to leave it took a while for the waiter to arrive. We were only planning to stay till 1:15-1:30 (arriving at 12:30), but we ended up staying until 1:35-1:40. The receptionist informed us about the Sunday brunch and the Wednesday AYCE night as we were paying for the bill. It did sound interesting, and I'm willing to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Oh let me count the ways to enjoy the Hot House Cafe. Yes it's big, but that means easy access. Yes the Brunch on Sunday is a bit pedestrian but there really is a great selection of food choices and options abound: sit inside and listen to jazz, outside and enjoy the Sunday sidewalk scene. Be seated at the bar and enjoy chitchat with the friendly bartender. 
People; what's not too like? Don't get your panties in a bunch it's only brunch.

My fave, the dinner & movie tickets deal during the week . Bevy at the bar and enjoy a great martini made by Shamus accompanied by the mushroom crustini then saunter on down to the Rainbow Theater for a charming little movie experience (think antithesis of Scottiabank theater.)  

Still whining? Then stay away from the Hot House Cafe, why spoil it for every one else ya friggin crybabies.."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for the brunch buffet and Wednesday night buffet but not for the regular menu so I thought what a great time to try it during winterlicious. I was not disappointed. I love pate so decided to start with that and it was delicious full of flavour. For my main course had the halibut poached in a mushroom broth. It was cooked perfectly which is hard to find with halibut as it can be dry fish. Finally I had the creme brûlée which was a light delicate finish to my meal. The service was also warm and friendly. Overall our table had a great time and would return for dinner or lunch anytime and not limit ourselves to just the buffets."}
{"text":"My recent visit to Hot House was disappointing. I was there for their Wednesday night dinner buffet and had made reservations in advance. We were seated at an odd foldable table covered in multiple black table cloths in the center of the restaurant where the a la carte cakes are displayed; we knew it was off as multiple servers were tripping on our chairs because this table should not have existed. 

The buffet menu is almost always the same and yet the quality seems to deteriorate with each visit. Nothing stood out in a positive way. The desserts all looked great, but they were all mediocre (I remember they were amazing in the past). If they weren't too dry, it was too moist, or too sweet. 

The reason I've even writing this review is because the service I received from the hostess was awful. When I went in and advised them that I had reservations, she just pointed to a direction as to where to find my table. Luckily for me, I saw my friend standing there, so I knew that was actually my table. Surprisingly, my friend had the exact same experience except he was the first one there and didn't know where the hostess was pointing so he had to go back and ask but no one was around, and then someone asked him if he was lost... I mean... are you serious?

I highly doubt I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"3.5

Review will be based on both the Sunday brunch and dinner menu.

Pros:
Very good Sunday brunch buffet
Very nice staff

Cons:
Place gets very busy at times

Most people know Hot House for their Sunday brunch buffet.  Come early on a Sunday because the place fills up fast.  Hot House has one of the most varied brunch buffets I've ever been too.  There are tons of items available.  It's a little pricey for your average Sunday brunch, but being all you can eat makes up for it.    

My only gripe is that it gets too busy for the staff making omelets to keep up.  There's usually a huge wait time for them because so many people want them.  I just skip it altogether because it's not worth the wait.  Other items could be finished quicker because of all the people, but Hot House manages to refill them pretty quickly.

I also came here for dinner on a Sunday night just this past weekend.  Not surprisingly, it was very busy again too.  We were told they had a table, but it would be a 15-20 minute delay for food. We had already been turned away from 3 other places so we stuck this one out.  The delay wasn't too bad when you factor in how busy it was and the fact it was father's day.

Our table ordered a couple of pasta dishes, a burger plate while I had the rib steak.  I was surprised to see a rib steak being offered as places like these usually only have sirloins.  The pasta portions were very big compared to other places like this. My rib steak was a very good cut of meat that I didn't expect.  It was a nice thick piece, not thin like other non-steakhouse restaurants offer.  I did ask for medium rare but the steak was more medium.  If you like it more on the rare side, you will need to ask for rare here.

The staff were all pretty nice throughout the meal even though you could see they were very busy.  They did a very good job despite the conditions they were under at the time.

All in all, Hot House is a pretty nice place to go to if you're in the area.  The food is good, but not anything special.  You won't be making the trek downtown just for this place, but it's a great option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Consistently consistent.

The food won't change your life, but it's always good. The Stella Mussels are awesome, and the pastas are delicious (though probably a bit overpriced).

The service is unremarkable; it's sometimes a bit slow/inattentive, but it's never been downright terrible.

The decor inside is a little tacky, but aren't all family-owned restaurants? The patio is a great spot in the summer."}
{"text":"Came here for a pre Paintnite meal. They have Paintnite at the back of the restaurant. We decided to have appetizers and drinks beforehand since we thought having a full dinner would take too long. Drinks were typical, nothing to report there. Their cocktails weren't that good for the price you pay but I guess you expect a decent tasting drink for what you pay for. The food we ordered was bruschetta and calamari which were recommended by our server. It was okay, but nothing special. I thought the calamari pieces were a little small and greasy. I did have a good time at Paintnite though and the service was good during that time. I don't think I'd come back for dinner but I'll definitely try their brunch buffet next time since I heard that's what the restaurant is known for. I do enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant for sure. It was nice and cozy but this was a Tuesday evening. I'm sure the brunch morning is busy!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 6 stars ! Our server was great! Food was amazing. We sat outside and it added to our experience. I had the Asian stir fry with shrimp ....YUMM!!!"}
{"text":"The 3 rating is only because the service was excellent. The food, on the other hand, was dismal. The pizza was bland, and the pasta left nothing more than a taste of tomatoes in the mouth.."}
{"text":"Yesterday I made a return visit to Hot House after not having been there for several years.  I was there with a large social Group for brunch; I'd previously had lunch, dinner, Sunday buffet brunch and buffet dinner there going back 15+ years but I'd never had brunch from their menu before.  I've never had such a delicious omelette before (ham & cheese, which came with also very delicious whole wheat toast and home fries) and we had great service for such a large group.  If I recall correctly I quite enjoyed all of the previous meals I've had there over the years and I believe they still have live jazz music on Sun. mornings for their buffet brunch that day.

The venue is quite spacious throughout and somewhat upscale in appearance.  It's also a fairly short walk east from 2 subway stations - King and Union - and St. Lawrence Market is close by (a couple of blocks east on Front St.) so it's in a nice, convenient to get to neighbourhood as well.  The venue also has a front patio during the warmer months."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at The Hot House Restaurant & Bar with my pals.  Our intent was to hang on the patio but the threat of rain had us sitting inside.

I ordered Makhani Curry Chicken.  It was good (it had a bit of a bite) and I'd get it again.  Franca ordered an Asian Stirfry with Chicken.  Rona ordered Tuna Poke Bowl.  Liz ordered Cappeletti.  I ordered an Apple Caramel Pecan Tart for dessert.  It was yummy!  I offered to share (note the four spoons) but only Liz had a couple bites.

Lisa was our server.  She was patient (she let us yak and catch up) and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious dinner on a Saturday and managed to get a spot outside. Their patio is large, as is the restaurant itself. To start we ordered a pitcher of the rose sangria which I thoroughly enjoyed. For starter I got the peach cold soup which is something I don't usually go for but ended up liking. The soup was a generous bowl size as well. I also tried the crab cake starter which came with one crab cake but was still satisfying. For main we all got the surf and turf, which for the price I can't complain. Dessert I got the lemon cake and also tried the chocolate tort with raspberry sorbet, both of which were really nice. The chocolate torte although was very very rich and would be too much to eat on my own as a dessert.
Looking around at other people's plates who didn't order from the summerlicious menu has tempted me to coming back here to try the regular menu items as they looked delicious and generous in portions."}
{"text":"Truly ladies and gentlemen, few things in life are extraordinary. One hopes that when you run into one of these things, it'll be an exemplary experience. But sometimes you come across something so awful, so horrible, that the experience itself becomes something like a revelation. 

Brunch at Hot House was that kind of horrible.

The eggs they served were something like the experience of a medieval sailing ship - tasting hard and dry like wood, but floating in a pool of murky water. Way to go, Hot House. I've never seen a chafing dish used to chafe so thorougly in my entire life. 

This went perfectly well with our room-temperature bacon, our large slices of dry toast and our gross and soggy breakfast pastries. Oh and let's not forget the actual DIRT on our grapes. They weren't just unwashed, but were perhaps dredged through the leavings of a vacuum cleaner at some point before they hit the restaurant? 

All of this for the miraculous price of about 21 dollars. Let me write that out in capital letters. TWENTY ONE DOLLARS. And the kicker, the KICKER to all of that? COFFEE is NOT INCLUDED. 

I mean, I've seen some cheap things in my life, but to not include an eighty cent cup of hot bean water with your breakfast, but to instead charge three bucks for the hour-old concoction of stale, bitter horror made this whole experience magically infuriating."}
{"text":"Came here for the Wednesday dinner buffet. Not bad. A good selection of foods; everything from carved beef, to fresh cooked pasta, and even rice with bbq chicken. And as Toronto's #1 consumer of cake, I was also happy about the 7-8ish cakes they had to choose from. Would recommend."}
{"text":"It's all about the sunday brunch. During the week, i'm not too impressed (except they do groups well), but the sunday brunch is something i crave every so often.

This is not mind blowing food. But the brunch has something for everyone and the sheer size of the place gives it this 'bring your extended family here while they're visiting for a wedding feel' to it. It's cheap at $17.99 per head and it also has live jazz music playing while you eat.

It's a buffet style brunch which a medley of different options like cold shrimp salads, mussels, jerk chicken, cold salmon, etc. The highlights in my mind are the prime rib roast carvery, and the freshly made egg station.
Then there is my aboslute favourite - the dessert station where you can have freshly made waffles and amazing amazing cakes to choose from. 
The dessert is one of the reasons i like going.

It's extremely busy, so you want to plan this sunday brunch and make a reservation. Don't even think about going without one."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible service. We stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch. We  gave our food order when the waitress came by for our drink order because we had enough time to review the menu. Then waited 30 minutes for our food, waitress didn't stop by to ask if all was good after. Needed our drinks topped up as we drank them during our wait. Finally I had to get up and go find our waitress to ask for the bill. Food was alright but 40 bucks for 2 burgers a handful of fries and 1 soda wasn't worth it.  
What a waste. 
She did ask us if we wanted dessert but we didn't have another hour to kill as we trying to catch a 3:45 movie! 

The restaurant was also filled with misbehaved children running around screaming. Next time we'll just go to McDonald's

P.S. My  lamburger was way over cooked."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. The service was poor and slow, and the food was pretty average. On a positive note the patio is big and the food's not crazy-expensive. I won't be back though."}
{"text":"Is your sense of taste deserting you? 
Do you have difficulty masticating?
Are you having difficulty viewing objects from a close distance?
Do you want to experience dining in the banquet hall of a seniors' residence?

If you answered yes to any or all of the above questions then Hot House Cafe is the right dining establishment for you! With active taste buds and active visual and olfactory senses no one would want to eat this terrible excuse for a buffet.

With a buffet that serves such tasteless, unnamed slop it does take quite a bit of fantasizing to ingest the stuff. I tried really hard to imagine that I was eating lasagna but the horrendous dish resolutely thwarted my efforts! All I could keep thinking was that the dinner served in my university cafeteria tasted better! The other dishes were pretty tasteless too.

On top of everything, our glasses were never filled unless we asked.

No matter how beautifully Cinderella's step sisters were dressed up they were still hags. Similarly, Hot House Cafe, your nice looking patio doesn't distract from the rubbish you serve during the buffet or that you're the perfect venue for a geriatric conference on bad food."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The food was good and priced very fair. We had the Tuesday date night special and both meals turned out excellent! We were both pleased with our choice to dine in this restaurant."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a buffet. A couple of decent items, and mostly crappy ones. For $21+, you are better off going anywhere else and ordering from the regular menu. I ended up eating the fruits and a couple of pieces of cake because they were the only decent items--my experience got shot to hell the minute I bit into cheese that had gone bad. Nasty! Avoid this overrated brunch."}
{"text":"You ever tried getting psyched to eat because of how huge the place is only to fall flat on your face because the food and experience didn't meet expectations? (whew!) well this is definitely NOT this place. You better bring your Game  if your having their Sunday Brunch buffet, albeit on the higher side in terms of price you won't be beat by the wide selection and variety that these guys have to offer. There was so many food selection that no wonder they area was huge and brimming with clientele. Service is superb! I don't know where to start, they have a very efficient omelet station that makes tasty omelettes my picky 9 year old  just gobbled it up quickly no excuses given.(thumbs up) a wide array of casseroles, pasta, Cold salads, breads, cheeses. highlights: mussels , omelette, CAKE STATION (yes, emphasis was needed). Their cakes were just amazing and they have an attendant that serves you your cake of choice which to me is good idea then theres no waste of food .They slice it thin enough for you to have your fill yet still be able to sample everything on their selection. Sharing the dits to my hubby and friends which dish or cake to try next just added to our already enjoyable Family weekend.:)"}
{"text":"I love the brunch at Hot House, esp the cake section.  Their chocolate cake is not too sweet and suit my taste.  I also love the chocolate croissant very much that I usually will have 3-4 each visit.  Although the thai salad is a bit spicy to me but I still love it.  With live Jazz I think worth to give it a try.  Better call to reserve a table a few days before in order to avoid long lineup."}
{"text":"I cringe writing this review. I lived in Toronto my whole life but I've since moved to Vancouver. I planned a trip back to Toronto to see friends and family; I raved about Hot House Restaurant to my friends in Vancouver and told them all how excited I was to eat there again. 

My best friend and I showed up at 11:30am on Sunday for the brunch buffet. We were told it would be an hour wait. I was looking forward to eating here so we put our names on the list. Sure enough, an hour later, we were given a table. 

My friend is a vegetarian, so other than the omelet station, the buffet was a bit of waste for him. Meanwhile, I stuffed my plates high and goobled down food as if I had never ate before. 

Our server was great. She was friendly and refilled our water often. 

I left feeling full and happy. I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day!

The next morning though, I didn't feel so great. My stomach was hurting and I thought I must have overate. Then I ran to the washroom and threw up. Over and over and over. I spent the entire day puking and feeling absolutely terrible. Turns out, I was suffering from food poisoning! My friend thought it must have been from the shellfish, which he didn't eat. Could have been from the beef as well. Whatever it was, it ruined a day of my vacation and I will never tell anyone to eat here again."}
{"text":"We went here on valentines night for the first time. The service was brilliant and very quick. We had three courses and it was all amazing we were really impressed. We were shocked that the overall price was so low aswell for such a good meal. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out this place and glad I finally did. Interesting and varied menu and excellent cocktails and wine list. The servers were excellent and attentive, without being annoying. We ordered the jerk cauliflower, which was good. Then we had pizzas and salads which again were delicious. 
I found it to be a little pricey for what we ordered but it was a good evening all around so.. it all worked out!"}
{"text":"Went to Hot House for their buffet brunch on New Year's Day. I didn't think it would be so busy but it was! The place was packed. They have lots of different food stations & types of food to try. There's something for everyone. I really enjoyed the waffes, roasted potatoes & salmon. I wanted to get more waffles but they make them fresh & they kept disappearing before I could get more. There's also an omelette station where they custom make your omelette right in front of you. 

The waitstaff we got were friendly, professional & quick. This restaurant is pretty big so be prepared for crowds on the weekend. This place seems pretty popular. I don't live near here so I wouldn't come here often. But it was a nice experience. I hope I can find something like this in my own neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Wife loved this place, I thought it was only ok. Went for dinner on the patio. Staff was a little slow but friendly. Food was only ok for the price we paid. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Hate to say it but the words buffet and fine dining rarely ever co-exist for me .    Sure the Hot House has a live band playing pedestrian jazz and the  charming clientele is mainly of the cane & personal mobility scooter variety, sporting the scent of Vick's vapo rub and what of the little brats who bud in front of you in line and get their icky little hands all over the serving ladles/dishes if not on the food itself.

Despite my best efforts to distance myself from the perils of Hot House we ended up coming here today for an impromptu Brunch with the in-laws.

  I found Hot House waaay overpriced and my frugal Father-in-Law was understandably miffed that the meals for the four of us that consisted of  unremarkable if not slightly better than cafeteria fare, plus a pitcher of spring water, a club soda & 2 coffees came to be over $100!!!    I realize we could eat all we wanted (which we didn't) but really it wasn't anything THAT spectacular.

* Mentionable tip: Try not to park on King BEFORE 1pm on a Sunday like we did!  We got nailed with a $60 ticket...not a good brunch day at all....  :("}
{"text":"I sure do hope you are reading this while they still operate the patio. Hot House is one of our default restaurant when we can't think of anything else. 

It's because it's good. 

Try their Gnocci and tell me you didn't like it... I'll tell you four million reasons why I love it. Call me, now. Ok.. granted, sometimes they can use less salt to make it but it's good more often than not. My friends always stare at their orders and salivate on my calorie-filled Gnocci whenever they taste it... on my plate. 

People, you gotta believe me. 

Two couches outside the patio with white linens add to summer ambience. It give a classy look. 

Food ranges from $ 15 lunch menu to just about $ 30 or under... it's worth it. They have a  good selection of wine list (though I don't drink) and I believe you can do BYOB for a corkage fee. 

On Wednesdays, forget your diet and dine buffer-style with style for under $ 20. On some days, wanna bee performers entertain the guests. Waiters are generally happy to serve you. 

Oh and check their bathroom.... there's a creepy mirror packed with ads - so I deducted a star."}
{"text":"The wait was long for a table (20 minutes with a reservation!) and I was hoping it would be worth it...but it was mediocre.
We made a reservation in advance for a Sunday lunch, but a table wasn't ready when our reservation time came up (and we even got there early in hopes that we'd get the table on time).

The buffet is edible, but nothing to be too impressed about. The layout is small and the lineup for fresh eggs was ridiculously long. Perhaps 2 cooking tables should be considered.

One thing i liked was the live music. But that's not enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"First time visiting Hot House and I wasn't disappointed at all. I came here for a friend's birthday brunch (group of 10). Great waiter service & a nice variety of food. You have choices of bread, croissants, sweets, fruit, cheeses, waffles, fish (salmon) olives, chicken pot pie, stir fry tofu, scrambled eggs, mussels...the list is endless. Even though I do not eat eggs, I was impressed with the omelette station where by there might be a short wait but your omelette is made to perfection with any ingredient you desire! I was 100% visit again...reserve in advance if you can!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the signage for this restaurant immediately makes me not want to go here.  Having lived close by for many years, I have never once been tempted despite the fact that it often seems quite busy and a few people have told me the food's pretty decent.

Having said that, yesterday I finally looked past my revulsion.  I met my family here for lunch mainly because we had plans to go to the Market and the Front St. Winners after.  Although it was a Saturday at one o'clock, prime lunch time in my opinion, the Hot House was very empty.  First the signage and now this... two bad signs.  We were shown to a table in a windowed alcove which made for good people and dog watching.  Good thing too because the service was so slow!  Our server was very pleasant, but it seemed like an eternity to get our food.

I had the smoked salmon plate.  It was a generous portion and although I will acknowledge it's pretty hard to mess up something as simple as smoked salmon,  cream cheese, and pumpernickle bread, it was good.  Other dishes ordered at the table included the eggs Benny, the lamb burger, and the french toast.  The first two were enjoyed but the french toast was a fail.  Honestly, when that dish arrived, I though, glad I didn't order that!  Apparently, it tasted as bad as it looked.

Overall, it was better than I expected in regards to the food, but I see no reason to return here."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Hot House Cafe a lot of times in the past.  It's the kind of place you choose when you're with non-adventerous eaters or you need something generic to please a large group with different palates.

We decided to come back to Hot House for a Summerlicious dinner ($25) before a girlfriend's stagette.  I easily made reservations online and was assigned a four person table on their large patio.  The patio seating was nice as we were able to watch the activity on Front St.

Appetizer - I chose the seafood bisque as the other 2 options were both Caesar salad.  The soup was hot, a bit spicy with some chunks of seafood but had an overwhelming fishy smell/taste.

Mains - I chose the swordfish with rice and vegetables.  My god, I swear this has turned me off of swordfish for the rest of my life.  It was extremely fishy smelling and tasting.  The swordfish meat was kinda chewy - somewhere between pork and fish texture.  I'm not sure how they caught this swordfish but I'm thinking it was probably clubbed on the head several times and then dragged by it's tail behind a boat all the way back to shore.

The others chose the surf/turf option and the ravioli.  Both seemed like a way better choice than the swordfish.  What was I thinking?

Dessert - I went with the sorbet (one scoop of passion fruit and one scoop of mango).  It was probably the best part of the meal, although I found the sorbet a bit gummy. 

Service was just okay.  Server seemed a bit overwhelmed with the dinner rush.  Also got the dreaded eye roll from her when we didn't order drinks other than water.  We were going to be boozing it up later that night for my friend's stagette so we were saving ourselves.  I hate that I have to explain myself in these situations - what if we were all pregnant, recovering alcoholics or diabetics that don't drink sugary pop?  The possibilities are endless but I hate being made to feel like a criminal just because we chose to stick with water.  *hiss, hiss*.  

I won't be enthusiastically suggesting Hot House in the future.  It's going on my 'last resort' list."}
{"text":"I have passed this restaurant a lot of time and have always observed crowded. So I thought of celebrating my birthday here. We tried Wednesday dinner buffet and every penny we paid was worth. They have so many options and well a spread buffet. Live pasta counter is amazing as you can try all types like red , white , green or mix  sauce pasta. My favourite was white pasta with spaghetti which was served pipping hot. They have good spread of cheese and different cold salads which was yummy. Best was ravioli pasta with cheese stuffedA in it. This is also part of their alcarte menu and would surely come back to eat only ravioli. Pizza was also part of buffet and loved that too. Lavish spread for deserts of more than 10 options in pastry and fruits. Enjoyed this place and would recommend Wednesday buffets."}
{"text":"I understand they are known for their bunch.  I hear it's great.  Met friends for lunch.  Regular fare and pricey for appetizers but the portions were of medium size. Very congenial staff.  Many tourists but that's  the draw of the market area."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch for my birthday. Was not disappointed! For 22 dollars all you can eat breakfast, talk about reasonable! They have a cheese board station, bread, scones, croissants station, cold salad station featuring a huge salmon with capers and lemon, omelette station, breakfast station, hot food station, roast beef station and dessert and waffle station. I would be lying if I said I didn't come here to eat as many waffles as my face could stuff (weird obsession with waffles, strawberries and whip cream). I tried a little bit of everything some hits and misses but my boyfriend liked everything ( I'm a bit pickier). I would definitely recommend this place as they have a little bit of everything for everyone. Especially if you have a sweet tooth the cake selection is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here tonight and I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was.   I wasn't sure what to expect after reading reviews. But the martini and dessert was exceptional. The dinner was ok. Io to the chicken supreme. It was the best dish I have ever had but it was good. I would probably order something else the next time I come. The food did come out very fast and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Very casual but nice place to grab a bite or have a few drinks with friends or family. They can accommodate a large size group because it is quite spacious inside. There is also a secluded area for a large group. We had the gnocchi and pasta and it was good. Had the Viognier French white wine and it was also good although their wine glass smelled funny- a little bit like wet towel or when wet glasses and left on a counter top upside down. Will visit here again."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant for my foodie family as I've eaten at Hothouse off and on for more than 25 years. Both my mother and brother ordered fish with rice pilaf and both woke in the middle of the night with upset stomach. Service was good but the kitchen needs to get their act together. Too bad because I now live in this neighbourhood. The buffet was good but ordering a la carte shouldn't be a problem.

Hello Andrew,

Thanks for the quick response. My brother is a chef and has worked in professional kitchens for more than 40 years, at times with his name on establishment, and he was quite aware what came out of Hothouse's kitchen was sub-par. 
My mother also noticed the rice pilaff was hard -  she described it was burnt bottom of the pan scrapings. I understand your restaurant not wanting to accept liability for upset stomachs however, the two people at the table with the same meal had the same reaction and woke up in the middle of the night with ingestion.  We all would have been better off with the buffet but the kitchen staff needs some review. Again, too bad. I would not recommend eating à la carte and tell diners to stick to the buffet, bar and desserts."}
{"text":"The jambalaya is a meal on its own and well worth the adventure!  Good food, good service and general ambience.

But gosh, the parking is fun!  The closest lot featured an automated machine that claimed to work but didn't give a receipt so who knows?  (BTW, it didn't appear on the monthly statement but it did keep the money of the next guyI warned him!)  

Not wanting to have to recover a towed vehicle and spoil the evening, I moved to another lot ... it took my money and gave me a receipt ... that was blank!  I put it on the dash and took a chance.  It was worth it!

It`s all been said before; accessible."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have only come here on Sunday for the brunch buffet and it's great! The food is always delicious and the staff are always friendly. I love how they have a jazz band to tune out the noise of ppl as it gets pretty busy here. The perfect time to come is between 9:30-10:30 am. You won't have to wait for a table between those times and you'll be able maneuver through the different food items easily. The food is not bland like u would expect from a regular buffet. Everything is seasoned well. My favourite is the bbq chicken and fresh hot waffles. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, not too loud, service was great. Crab cakes were delicious, wild boar bolognese was decent and huge portion (could only finish half). I would definitely return."}
{"text":"So, I've been to this place many times, and have always found it to be good, but maybe not great. My latest experience however was fantastic.

My mom was on a wheelchair, and they seated us in an area which would be convenient for her, despite the crowd at Winterlicious weekend lunchtime.

Service - quick, attentive, courteous and great overall!

Food - we ordered off the Winterlicious menu. There were three of us and I took a bite of everyone's food, so here's the rundown. Crabcakes - delicious and amongst the best I've had, served with good aioli. Tomato basil soup - fresh, thick and flavourful. Bolognese pasta - delicious! Chicken and goat cheese ravioli - loved it. Not an overpowering goat cheese flavour, but a delicious hearty pasta. Pizza Napolitan - thin, crisp crust with a delicious flavour sauce and great toppings. Dessert - mango sorbet was excellent, strawberry topped chessecake was fabulous (huge portion, good for those with big appetites). Peanut butter - white chocolate pie - another delicious dessert with nutty, salty and sweet flavours balanced well.

Wine - the featured Winterlicious wine was a good Pinot Grigio with well-balanced flavours.

$15 per person was never better spent than on this meal. With drinks, charges came to $77 for 3 people (taxes in)."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! Live music and all you can eat buffet for $20. This place is classy and spacious. The only downside is the waiting time, which can be up to 40 minutes without reservations. Strongly recommend the cheescake and the variety of salads."}
{"text":"Had the pollo pasta. Did not like the use of half-shell pasta for this dish. Also tried a bite of the dill salmon which I guess was ok if you like dill. Side veg were doused in oil. It was basically as good as I expected. I would give it 2.5 if I could. It was not horrible or anything, just not something I'd pay money for again. Was surprisingly busy for a Sunday night though."}
{"text":"Came here once for a friend's birthday brunch. Right away, I think I fell in love with the architecture and design of the restaurant. Design aside, we were seated right away (as we had reservations) and hot a wonderful table with a good view. It was a Sunday, so the place was packed! 

The selection of food was quite impressive, ranging from your typical breakfast foods to more exotic choices, which I found quite neat. I'm a huge fan of savoury breakfasts, and that's what I got! Tons of potato choices, eggs, shrimp, breads, bagels, and even an omelette bar! That was pretty cool. 

The selection of cakes and pastries was quite impressive as well, with muffins, cakes, Danishes, and other lovely goods! 

We were also lucky enough to see a live band performing, and the jazz music was a beautiful complement to the birthday brunch. 

The price of the brunch was about $30 (I ordered coffee as well) + tip. The experience was lovely, with superb service and great food choices. My philosophy on this is \"why not spend a bit for a good time?\" And that's exactly what we did and had! :)"}
{"text":"Good place for Sunday brunch, it's award winning buffet style! Very busy place so you definitely need to make your reservations ahead of time, especially for larger parties. They had a good variety of salads, breakfast items, hot savoury items, breads and desserts. There several meat options in the hot savoury items but not as many vegetarian friendly dishes other than the salads. They also had a custom omelette bar. Live jazz music plays between 11am-3pm. During brunch, they had a mimosa deal, 2 for $9. Not too bad as regular price for one mimosa is $6. Our server was very kind, topped off our waters, coffees and teas regularly without being asked. Overall a great place to bring someone for their first brunch. Parking around Hot House is free until 1pm on Sundays but they also have a shared parking garage."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's day Brunch.

Very busy and organized. Have been going to the Hot House for Mother's Day for the last five years. 

The food was Ok but nothig special. It's a buffet.  The mussels were bad. Actually very bad.

 The rest of the buffet  was good. 

I don't think the food has improved, but remains the same.

See you next year."}
{"text":"After the painting classes, we picked a restaurant randomly. Luckily, we picked the correct one. 
The decor, menu variety, service and the taste were amazing. We three ordered jambalaya, which was so filling and yummy. Lunch menu, 13. Dollars.
The rice and meat were juicy and creamy.
Minha's baked potatoes and Cherry's lobster spaghetti were awesome! Will come back!"}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed my favorite restaurant in Toronto??? I have celebrated many birthdays (both mine and friends') here. I have always been impressed by the food and the service. I have been to their Wednesday buffet as well and each visit I have always walked away satisfied. I love to go explore new restaurants but The Hot House Cafe will always hold that number 1 spot in my little foodie heart. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Unappetizing pastas and pizza. Food was mostly cold and lacking in flavour. Super friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Went today for Sunday Brunch! They've upped their prices to $26.95 per person.

We made reservations easily a few days before hand so we didn't have to wait, but there were quite a few groups in front waiting so make sure you reserve a table! Even though we reserved for 5 people, they gave us a square table meant for 4, so it was a bit squished.

The restaurant feels very classic Canadian: Nothing fancy but feels home-y/cozy. The seating area is huge but the buffet area is on the other side of the restaurant and isn't huge. 

The food is pretty yummy but a lot of is carbs to fill you up faster I guess. The more expensive stuff like smoked salmon & salami ran out really quickly and they stopped serving it. If we came 30 minutes later, we wouldn't have gotten any at all. I think we were most impressed with their mussels and veal. 

They also have an impressive dessert area with many varieties of cake! Perfect if you have a sweet tooth. Drinks other than water are not included. Mimosas are $9 for 2 which isn't bad.

The food was pretty good but at that price, I doubt I would make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"They have Blanche de Chambly on tap which warrants a mental note to come back for at some point in time.

As for what I've had, it's Coffee and Tiramisu. Turns out it isn't a bad spot for some weekend afternoon tea, as odd as it may sound."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their Sunday Brunch. This has to be the best brunch in town. Fresh, hot, steaming food. Everything from salmon to pasta to mussels. BBQ chicken thigh, omlete station, lasagna, pilaf. Coffee is excellent. I love coming here especially during the summer. Desserts are amazing, but often I don't have room for it. Strongly reccomend making reservations if you are planning on coming here for the brunch."}
{"text":"It has a very good plates, it's our first time in Toronto and we have good reviews from this restaurant.
BUT, I had an incident with one of the waiters. He throw over me a mussels plate... He replaced it but the owner didn't have any kind of reward with us... I'm not talking about to have our food for free, but at least the coffee.. She (the owner) acted very arrogant.
It's easy to treat your customers in a good way, but is easier to do whatever."}
{"text":"Hot House is a good standard restaurant in the St. Lawrence Market area. It's a good restaurant, but I've never found the food to be outstanding.  Last time I was there I had the orange roughy which was very good, but again not outstanding. The desserts that I've had there are excellent"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at this place. 
For dinner and lunch, they have a nice patio which is a perfect place to get drinks, mingle with friends, and people watch. The personal pizzas are delish. Can't go wrong with pizza and drinks. Crust is nice and thin. The rest of the dinner/lunch menu are just alright 

However, My favourite thing to do here is Sunday brunch with my girlfriends. Nice ambiance with live jazz band playing in the background. It's all you can eat brunch, quality and selections are good. Price has gone up over the years, we had brunch today, it was around $23 per person. Fresh waffles, french toast, omelette station, cheese & fruits, and other lunch items (pasta, lagsana, mussels, roast beef etc). I like the cake selection 

 Perfect place to enjoy good food, and spend time with friends"}
{"text":"For some inexplicable reason Hot House is only open for brunch on SUNDAYS. This makes no sense to me as I've been in the neighbourhood on Saturday mornings and erroneously attempted to score brunch there at least half a dozen times, always forgetting that no, they do not serve brunch on Sundays (forcing me to head to the lesser Druxy's down the street). They should really start offering Saturday brunch, especially considering all of the tourists in the neighbourhood at HHOF, Union Station, Hummingbird Centre, ACC, etc.

The selection of brunch items on the buffet tables is astounding. Everything ranging from custom omelettes to yogurt and fruit, tortes and pies, rack of lamb, spaghetti, etc. 

Do try the cheese cappelletti. Not a typical brunch item, but it's worth a sample even if you're craving eggs & pancakes instead! I have to fight the urge to return a third and fourth time with a plate of just cappelletti - it's that good!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times, for dates, hanging out with friends or dining with coworkers. They offer a huge assortment of food. I recommend going Wednesday nights for their pasta buffet bar where for a low price of $20, you get custom cooked pasta, a selection of steak and a healthy helping of desserts like chocolate layered cake. This has been a favourite choice for winterlicious and summerlicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's huge!

I've been here for both Summerlicious and Winterlicious, and I loved the food. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge! I always end up packing half of my entree home. 

Service was a little slow, but nothing too terrible."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza. Enjoyed the patio dining. Slow service but friendly. Good menu!"}
{"text":"Hot House is a solid neighbourhood standby. It's a sprawling space with warm ambiance, and thus manages to simultaneously be a good date spot and a place to bring a big group, even a family.

Sunday brunch is a standout, and the dinner buffet is fantastic. As for the regular menu, good pizzas (including gluten-free crusts!) and pastas, and the appetizers are above average. Milage varies on the rest of the menu, but I can't comment on the meat dishes.

Servers are typically friendly and helpful, I've been a dozen times and had perhaps one or two subpar service experiences.

Overall, the food may not blow you away, but it's a reliable place if you're in the neighbourhood and don't want to risk a bad experience. When in doubt, with a group or on a date, duck in!

Oh and grab the little fruit candies on your way out!"}
{"text":"The Hot House Restaurant and Bar (before it was The Hot House Cafe) was part of my whole adult life.
I went there on one of my early dates with my then girlfriend and now wife.  Went with my fam and the inlaws.  Now finally went with the kids.  Why so long?  Sunday brunch in the city is a long drive from the Hill.  Also, this place does brisk business on Sunday from morning till the brunch closing.  Always hard to get a reservation unless you plan ahead...so...plan well ahead and call them a at least a few days in advance.  More if you have a group of people.
Brunch has changed over the almost two decades.  What is the same is the ubiquitous omelette station (two nice guys really sweating it out in the hot house - they are working 3 burners each under the hot sun that is glaring into the solarium).
The standard meat station - make sure you tell the guy exactly how much roast or ham you want.  For some reason, he cut me a sliver of roast that was paper thin, and folded it onto my plate and said \"Bon appetit!\"  Not sure if he was saving the roast or trying to tell me that I might be getting round...either way, I told him to redo his attempt and then wish me a good meal again!  The salad bar, dessert station, and breads also remain the same.
The rest changed with the times.  There are Asian foods, Indian curry, different salads, and Italian favourites nestled all the way around the solarium area.
My kids had their fill and I left there making sure I didn't over do it and fall asleep on the drive back up.
Overall, the brunch was good - can't get excellent food when prepared in batches and self served by the masses.
The brunch is not only one of the better ones in the city, it is also fairly priced.
If you enjoy Jazz, there is live music and it can get a little loud.  If you want some place quieter to sit, make sure you tell the hostess when you make your reservation.
Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday brunch and had a lovely afternoon! The brunch had a great variety of food, particularly since I'm not much of a 'brunch' person, and the 2 mimosas for $9 were a great deal!   The mussels and the broth they were in were DELICIOUS - I had three bowlfulls, as was the salmon and capers! I also had bites of almost every cake, all yum, but I think the waffle, red velvet, and coconut cake won in a three-way tie!

The best part of Hot House was how accommodating they were of our large group. A few people were running late, but they allowed us to sit down and get drinks while we waited for them to arrive instead of making us wait in the foyer. We were there towards the end of brunch, so it may have been because they were less busy, but I appreciated it!"}
{"text":"Great location & brunch option!! I've been to Hot House on many occasions for brunch and love the live jazz while having their tummy buffet that has many options. If you want a fresh omelet ... Done! Craving carving station...its there!!  My favourite dish in buffet is their cheese capeletti.  It is comfort, saucy and cheesy, Great combo.  Their desserts are out of this world! Be sure to try the banana chocolate cake and the baileys cheesecake.  They also have great brunch cocktail options such as 2 Caesars for $9.  We needed an extra shot of vodka with ours but still great deal.  The brunch is all you can eat and offers great value."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant by chance because an establishment that I frequent was closed for a private function and I already paid for local parking. It was a Monday night so not too busy. Had the Monday special of a pound of PEI mussels for $10. Was excellently prepared in Stella Artoise. Moved on to the wild boar pasta which was hearty and generously portioned. Only complaint is that a wine bottle re-corking service is not offered. So I had to do order by the glass."}
