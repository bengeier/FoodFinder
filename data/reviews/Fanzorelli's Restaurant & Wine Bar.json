{"text":"Huge disappointment! I'm being generous for giving this Restaurant a 1 star rating. That's only because the shrimp appetizer I had was good. The service and the food was of very poor quality. Don't order the steak...bad cut of meat and had no taste. The steak meal comes with veggies that were not seasoned either and a sorry looking roast potatoes that resembled hash browns from a diner. If you are charging $28 for a steak dinner, then give me a decent cut of meat...not something that looks like it was purchased from a grocery store. Someone from our group got sick from eating the pasta (which didn't look appetizing).  The pizza was not good. There was nothing special about their salads either. I don't understand how restaurants can charge a certain amount for food but don't deliver in quality. I do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice clean restaurant in Brampton. Friends told us about Fanzorelli's. Here's what we thought....

The service was ok. Our waitress was very nice and helpful.  

The atmosphere is a little cheesy. The pictures are stapled to the wall and the tables and chairs are predictable but clean. The hanging lingerie on a clothes line was a nice touch but again, cheesy. The atmosphere was filled with funky house music. Nice touch

The menu was a little too large.. To many choices. We were surprised they did not offer a calabrese salad. We were even more surprised when they custom made one for us and it was very delicious. ( If you order one make sure you ask them to include the balsamic vinegar)

My wife ordered a pizza and I ordered the quail. Both were good.. Not great but good.  The pizza was fresh and my quail was fried just right. The mashed potatoes were a little bland. The portion size was massive! I was also pretty full after the salad.

We would go back if just to see if the experience can be duplicated. 

If you're in Brampton.. Try it.. You may like it!"}
{"text":"Cozy little spot. Good service with pretty good food and excellent size portions 

Wine list a little sparse though for an Italian eatery and \"wine bar\""}
{"text":"Well my brother and his girlfriend and her family went here for dinner yesterday. And by the looks of it none of them liked it. 9 out of the 16 people partaking in the meal sent it back because of various reasons. Ranging from pasta still being frozen to a steak taking 2 hours to cook coming out to them extremely black. Id say 2 hours is an extremely absurd amount of time to wait for your meal. Making them pay for it is another story. I just hope if you suddenly have the cajones to go there it will be better than their experiences."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great authentic Italian restaurant try here. They are friendly and the food is a reasonable price. A little hint for the guys, after dinner Gage park is within walking distance so make sure you bring your skates and have a romantic skate in the park."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, had the nicest waitress who helped all of us with our pronunciation of the dishes and the host was very friendly when seating us. I had the gnocchi and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent food but is overpriced and service is below average. Went on a Friday evening and probably won't return."}
{"text":"It's a tiny restaurant but it's cozy and sweet. I have some sentimental relationship with this place but nonetheless its great. I have had pizza and pasta dishes there and it's always delicious. Me and my boyfriend both have random cravings for the gnocchi-it's the best.

The only thing that I've had a bit of an issue of is the service, they are, without a doubt, sweet and knowledgeable but a lot of the time I feel forgotten and is hard to get their attention. 

But overall, no question I would go there again!"}
{"text":"Classic Italian restaurant in Brampton been around for decades. 

I enjoyed the simple, but slightly tacky atmosphere. 
Nice staff, slightly slow but friendly nonetheless. 

We ordered the Leonardo and margherita pizza. Both were really delicious, having a traditional Italian flavour to it, which is rare. Excellent tomato sauce and good toppings. Wasn't too impressed with the mozzarella but still good overall."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing live entertainment, the night I went there was this elderly gentleman singing good oldies classics like Neil young, Frank Sinatra, totally mesmerizing. The old school Italian feel."}
{"text":"This is our favourite date night or special occasion spot. The salads, the pizzas, the daily specials. And ohhh the desserts . Great wine list, and excellent service."}
{"text":"First time with family wanted to try someting new... great loaction in old brampton ...great portion sizes, good service and very good on the wallet"}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten here in many years - we always felt it was not great.

We've recently been for dinner on 2 separate occasions and are now fans. The menu is varied, includes pasta, meat options, pizza. The flavours of the pasta and pizza we had were very good. Salads make good starters.

Portions large, prices fairly reasonable.  They have several choices of wine by the half litre."}
{"text":"Had a family dinner for my sis in law's birthday tonight. 

I ordered the grilled calamari & salmon. The calamari was good & the salmon is one of the best I've had. My family ordered two pastas & a pizza. One pizza & pasta was on their special of the day menu & the other pasta was the seafood linguine. They also ordered the homemade tiramisu. I am on a strict low carb diet so I can't eat any grains, dairy or sugar. My family really liked the food. I will come back just to try their pizza & homemade tiramisu."}
{"text":"Mother's day lunch was great. Good food, pleasant service and great atmosphere. It was loud but the place was busy with families so it was understandable. Another good experience. I'm looking forward to out next meal there."}
