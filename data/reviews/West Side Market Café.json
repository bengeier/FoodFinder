{"text":"Fantastic breakfast, and great lunch!  Cleveland classic- and a great cure for that hang-over.  Friendly staff, and hometown feel."}
{"text":"Always super friendly service and great food!   I love their many manifestations of eggs benedict and their sandwiches are killers."}
{"text":"Great location for a pit stop during shopping.  Amazing breakfast if you're in the mood for diner-style food."}
{"text":"I used to be really in love with the hashbrowns here. They were diced, with diced green and red peppers and onions that were all sautéed together and were so amazing!   But ever since the new menu they have breakfast potatoes - :( - which are fine but not hashbrowns.  You can request the hashbrowns but it's not the same recipe.  It's as if they get a hashbrown patty, chop it up and then throw in some fresh peppers and onions - not good.  I'd frankly prefer the breakfast potatoes to this poor substitute. Makes me sad every time I go there.    I generally just get the breakfast special which is good an cheap and so for that 4 stars; I can't speak to the other dishes."}
{"text":"Good LORD, I have never ever had a better Eggs Benedict in my entire life. And the prices? Good luck getting mediocre food for that kind of money, much less amazing food! And it WAS amazing! I highly recommend this place. It's a seat-yourself, full-of-regulars type joint, but they're nice to anyone who walks through the door. Great beer specials, too."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing for breakfast.  Good price amazing food.  Can't wait to get back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This small diner outside Cleveland's west side market is that perfect place to have breakfast.  Bustling and friendly, this Cafe has great food at very reasonable prices.  It's small and crowded at times but no one seems to mind.   I had the Benedict Arnold and it was absolutely delicious.  The hashbrowns were the best hashbrowns I've ever had.  My only complaint is that the tomato wasn't quite ripe. Would highly recommend hitting this place up for breakfast or brunch and then heading over to the market for some fresh produce, meats and cheeses.  Love this area of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Since the previous owners, Randy and Linda, moved on I really haven't felt the need to come back to the WSMC. There are still some breakfast/lunch choices of what once remained, but also some newer choices by whoever runs it now. A couple months ago I stopped in for breakfast, the simple eggs, potatoes, and bacon. Their version of homefries is the Yukon gold potatoes, which were just ok...not the awesome, crispy hashbrowns that were probly the best in town back in the day. Needless to say it was disappointing.  Today I decided to come back in again, because why not. I ordered the same thing as last time except with eggs scrambled, sausage, and surprisingly enough the old hash browns o'brien. As soon as I saw that plate I was so happy and excited....if only for a moment.  The eggs were cooked and fine, a couple pieces of toast a little burnt but still edible-not alot of butter. The sausage looked a little to pink and sketchy being cooked and the flat-top marks on only one side, but its been a few hours since eating and I haven't had any undesired trips to the toilet. As for the \"famous\" hashbrowns, I really was bummed out. Not any crispy goodness to them at all, and just heavy with oil. They weren't very bad, but could have been better. Alot of peppers and onions thrown in as well. Perhaps asking for them to be crispy or well done would help next time? Who knows.   My galpal had the WSM omelette, which was decent. An open omelette with bacon, scallion, feta, spinach, and mushroom. Never liked spinach and feta, but I could make an exception with that omelette.  Server was great, real chill and attentive. The visit wasn't that bad, and wasn't that great for a Thursday morning. I assume some or most of their products are courtesy of the market vendors, if so that's great. Alcohol for breakfast? No problem. Maybe a lunch visit could be warranted one of these days, but who knows."}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast in town! The staff and the food was great. I had the WSM omelette and a mimosa and I was pleased with every bite. Since I was alone I wanted to order to go at first, but when I felt the pleasant vibe and nice demeanor of the staff I opted to dine in.  I go to the market often, but this little gem is new to me."}
{"text":"Had eggs Benedict Arnold there yesterday.  Eggs were done perfectly and the sauce was great.  They've recently gone to bigger hash browns which are good, but not as good as the smaller more expensive ones they used to use.  The coffee is excellent and the service is quite good.  I like this place quite a bit.  The strip steak is also excellent."}
{"text":"After touring the West Side Market, my husband and I stopped by the West Side Market Cafe. It was conveniently located towards the back of the Market, so we just had to go and experience it!  Evidently, we got there just at the right time - before the breakfast rush came. So, there was no issue getting a table in this tiny diner. I got the Spanish Open-Face Omelet since it sounded the most interesting.  I thought it lacked chicken in my opinion. But the salsa verde foam thing on top of my eggs was fairly tasty. Unfortunately, I detected some egg shell in my dish, which kinda turned me off but these things happen...  Overall, the food and service was decent. However, I think most people come here for lunch, so I might have come at the wrong time..."}
{"text":"Tucked in a corner of the West Side Market there lies the market's very own cafe.  i've been to the market dozens of times, but never had really ventured into the cafe until today, when i met one of my friends for brunch. i'm not sure how much of an institution brunch is for any of ya'll, but brunch is a special deal in kimmy land.  the cafe does a pretty good job of it, as well.  my only complaint is that service was wicked slow, and it took a long time for our food to arrive.  however, we were filling the time with good conversation, so nothing is lost.  they don't have a \"brunch deal\" that comes with champagne or a bloody mary or anything like that, but they do have a wide selection of some good stuff to eat for brunch. and good coffee.  it's not too pricey, either.   i highly recommend for a lazy sunday morning/afternoon."}
{"text":"West Side Market Cafe: casual, cheap, eccentric  *Eggs Oscar: Two eggs poached on a toasted English muffin w/crab and topped w/ champagne cream sauce. (Too much crab)."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem, not too many other places in the city alike. Not trendy, expensive or exotic. Just a real, delicious diner, with fresh food and quality ingredients. I haven't been here for years and not much has changed. Still has surprisingly standout eats for the cheap.   Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service can sometimes be a little slow. Waiting 20 minutes for food @ breakfast, no bueno.   No matter what you order from here you wont be disappointed. Between the french toast, bacon, potatoes, chipped beef, egg sandwich, everything is so good and cheap. Great choice for breakfast if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese burger in the pictures is no longer available. That was disappointing!  But the stuffed pepper soup is delicious. The walleye po boy was good but small. The west side market burger was great! We will return."}
{"text":"I come here for brunch often and it never fails to satisfy. There is never a wait to be seated and the food is always great quality. My favorite breakfast item is the wsj omelette. It's one of the best omlettes I've ever had! I love the feta and mushrooms with bacon. Tastes very fresh! The hash brown are also amazing with diced green pepper and onion. This place is definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Straightforward, All-American breakfast.  You can't go wrong with the $3.25 Market Breakfast--two eggs, toast, and potatoes.  Trust me, you won't be hungry.  And their Eggs Benedict is pretty good, too.  It looks like a greasy spoon and it IS a greasy spoon.  Just touch the back of your chair before you sit down.  eeeeewwwww.  But you gotta love the Seniors who congregate there during weekday mornings for their morning coffee and discussions about how they got free samples in the market that morning.  Viva America."}
{"text":"A no frills diner. We stopped in for breakfast and had the traditional breakfast and huervos. The traditional had thick cut bacon. Highlight were the Yukon gold breakfast potatoes. Huervos were pedestrian. Prices were reasonable.  If you go in not expecting to get your sox knocked off you will get a decent breakfast."}
{"text":"Super old school and cute. The girls are really sweet & know their stuff. Get the fennel sausage gravy over eggs with rosemary toast. Coffee just right. Very relaxing atmosphere, they don't hurry you along or crowd you in too tight. Totally going back & bringing my mom!"}
{"text":"best meal I have ever eaten. Get the waffles with preserves and whipped cream. The cream is homemade, the preserves are too! I loved it! Still thinking about it months later! Smoky hash was also great!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. There's a certain charm to the West Side Market and all its attachments.  WSM Café is no exception - it's a place that feels like it hasn't changed too dramatically in the last few decades.  Despite the classic diner feel though, tables aren't too terribly close together.  Cost: 5. They seem to have just launched a new menu, yet stuck with rock bottom diner prices.  Two words: Market Breakfast (ok a few more words, 2 eggs, home fries & toast).  One price: $3.50.  Beat that $5 footlong.  Food Quality: 3. Acceptable quality for a nice morning breakfast before shopping at that market or as a stop on the hangover recovery train.  Love the spicy bacon.  Had the pancakes in the past which are also pretty good, and they serve real syrup too.  Service: 3. Hit or miss over the multiple times I've been, but in typical diner fashion then tend to care more about themselves and less about the customers.  That said, I've had a few great waitresses recently.  It's also nice they they're open on Sunday despite WSM being closed.  When to return: Pre-West Side Market shopping.  Hungover.  When the bank account is dwindling ahead of payday.  For a no-frills breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast for a great price.  Classic old diner, good service, and a great venue given the market and surrounding business district."}
{"text":"I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong. I wanted to update my review because I finally got the chance to come back here. They must be under new management because the service was night and day. No complaints! Attentive and very friendly. We were approached and sat and then served within a few minutes.   Now I can finally review the food! I never got the chance to eat here and I'm so glad I did. Our server said the special today was chicken paprikash. Ohhhh you said the magic words! The chicken was fall apart tender, sauce was perfect, dumplings were perfect... no complaints. My  date got the steak sandwich, which he enjoyed. But I won't go into detail because he can write his own review later.   Overall, I'm really happy with this experience. I would love to add this to one of our regular hangout spots and put that old one star review behind us. No hard feelings!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to the historic West Side Market. It had recently caught on fire and was restored within the last 18 months or so.  After living in northeastern Ohio for the past almost 9 years, this was one of our opportunities to explore the area. The West Side Market was fabulous.   We arrived there hungry and wanted some place to sit down. The vendors inside the Market directed us to the Cafe. In retrospect, we wish they hadn't.  First, our server literally threw our utensils towards us on the table. She would later go on to toss the plastic cups of blue cheese dressing, tartar sauce, and salsa on our table. She probably thought it was fun and familiar, but we thought it was completely unprofessional.  Second, my wife and I ordered the chorizo dip, a fish taco, a cup of chicken poprashaw, a cup of coffee for me, and a cup of tea for my wife.  Our total was $39.15. We were stunned! The service was below average and the food was barely average.  Specifically, the fish taco probably would have been better if it wasn't fried super dry. The chicken poprashaw was super thick and had the consistency of gruel. Finally, my Buffalo chicken chopped salad was so salty, I could not finish it. In all fairness, the tortilla chips with chirizo dip was all we should have ordered. The rest of the menu, the environment, and our server, we're all a disappointment.   Next time we visit the West Side Market we will eat somewhere else first and make our way through the wonderful market environment."}
{"text":"I come here with my coworkers after our night shift at the hospital for breakfast and beer. Great place! The food is always delicious. The staff is very friendly. This is just what you need to decompress after a long night int the intensive care unit! I wish they could serve \"hard liquor\" mixed beverages in the mornings. Sometimes, you just need it! Overall great place. If recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wavering between 3-3.5 stars. Very cute and busy little cafe inside the West Side Market (which I LOVE and come to frequently). I ordered a mushroom omelet with hash browns and bread. The best part of the breakfast was definitely the mushrooms (good variety, and presumably they were from the market) and the bread (rosemary bread, toasted and buttered perfectly! Also presumably from the market.) I could eat the rosemary bread forever. The hash browns w/ onions and peppers were also good, but I'm a sucker for anything with fried potatoes.  What's left is the egg from the omelet... it was overcooked and a bit rubbery. I felt a little disappointed that I wasn't able to finish it. Seems like the execution and cooking needs some work.   Great place to meet up with friends after a trip to the market though."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place showed up on my search but regardless, went with the many reviews of praise only to be sadly disappointed yet again.  It must be that what I think is good food is not the same as what others consider good food.  Hell, I have friends that still think McD's is great for breakfast. Go figure.  In saying that, this place is hidden inside the west side market, made up of a vast amount of meat markets.  Lots of sausage and slabs of meat, one after another.  Strange but interesting.  We finally found this place and it is a diner/cafe, lets just say.  It looked and felt more like a bar with a dining area.  Anyway, we were hoping for breakfast but didnt make it so I settled for the Wild Mushroom Grilled Cheese, I was disappointed, maybe because I hate settling and the menu didnt offer anything else I was interested in; for me, a recipe for disaster.    The fries were greasy and the sandwich was so sour, I could not even finish the first half.  And I was so hungry.  My BF has the pulled pork which was also, Meh. He attempted to finish mine but he also found it to be sour.  He ate his because, yes, he was hungry.  Nothing worse than eating something that you dislike just for the possible nutrition content and to rid yourself of hunger pangs.  :(  Sorry I couldnt give this place a better review, it is what it is."}
{"text":"This place is terrific!! Good menu, good service. Love going here for lunch."}
{"text":"Typical diner.  Fries were a little over cooked.  Great if you want a good ole fashion diner experience or are in a pinch with two hungry kids.  Probably better places to eat in the area, but overall not bad.  Iced Tea tasted freshly brewed, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Great prices, good food, nice atmosphere.  Got the eggs Wellington and pancakes. Goood sized steak and the pancakes were huge and fluffy. I'd go for BK again!"}
{"text":"While visiting the West Side Market, my friend suggested going to the Cafe for lunch. I was very much in a salad mood and I was delighted to see some choice salads on the menu, as well as soups. It was rather chilly in Cleveland on the day we went to the Market, vice my first few days, which were insanely hot and humid.   For an appetizer, we shared a bowl of Italian Chicken Noodle soup. I can't quite pinpoint the exact differences because it isn't regular Chicken Noodle (obviously), but it was delectable. My friend had a burger for her main course and I had the Italian Chop salad. As I have a lactose intolerance/allergy, I substituted artichoke hearts for the gorgonzola.   I was completely blown away by this salad. The peppercinis that were in the salad were house-made as were the pickled red onions. The waitress also told us that the red wine vinegarette that is used in the salad is made from the vinegar left from the pickled red onions. The best part of this salad was the Salami crisps. I guess this is a local Cleveland thing to fry up salami or pepperoni, but boy, I had never had salami cooked in this fashion and I couldn't get enough. The sheer size of this salad was unreal as well. They don't scrimp on you and I had plenty for a snack later on in the day."}
{"text":"My standards for diner food are really high and this place is cheap but it just didn't cut it.  Nice service, no wait even though it was busy this morning.  I went with the standard breakfast, nothing fancy, ordered eggs over easy with toast and hashbrowns and opened up my book to study.  I was able to read about half a page before my breakfast was brought out to me.  Now this immediately raises alarm bells in my head b/c I know that the majority of my meal was probably just seating under heatlamps from the night before or from really early in the morning.  It probably took them about 2 minutes to get my plate to me from the time I placed my order.  Eggs over easy?  This still means that the whites should be fully cooked, the \"over easy\" part refers to the yolk.  \"Toast\" was barely toasted, more like a couple slices of warmed Rye with some butter on it.  And the hashbrowns didn't even compare favorably to McD's hashbrowns, they were hard, barely seasoned and had about 5 small chunks of green pepper in them...uh, if you're going to add green pepper, add it, or just leave it out completely, don't tease people!  So, maybe I caught the cook on a bad day, but I'd rather pay a couple of dollars extra and get a decent breakfast than go cheap and unsatisfied...."}
{"text":"There's nothing like taking the time to sit back, read the paper and enjoy a good breakfast. I don't have the time to do this at home, so I always make it a point to get my early morning grub on when I'm on the road.    The West Side Market Cafe was the perfect place to tie on my early morning feedbag. An Omelette, some hash-browned taters, toast and a couple of gallons of coffee is what this old body needed to start the day. The service was good and the food was excellent. I'll be sure to make another pit stop at this quaint little eatery the next time the road takes me though Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! The staff are friendly and efficient, never had an issue with service. They have a great breakfast selection and the blueberry pancakes are the best!"}
{"text":"Really nice wait staff, food was pretty good. I loved watching the chef come in with fresh meat from the market next door. You know everything is fresh and deliceous. We had the zucchini fritters (yum) tuna melt and turkey blt, it was hot, fresh, and we didn't have to wait long after we ordered. Good prices on all the menu items."}
{"text":"Breakfast was really good and we all fell in love with the rosemary bread/toast. Our meals included omelets, sausage gravy over toast (sounds weird to me but hubby liked it a lot) and super good and actually crispy like we ordered them hash browns.   I had to decide if this would be a 3 star or 4 star review.  I bumped it up to 4 stars because of the historical aspect - kinda cool to realize how old the building is and you have to give props to a place that's been around as long as it has.  The food was a bit expensive, imho.  We were there during the week for breakfast and yet no specials?  Oh, and the service wasn't stellar...a bit slow and impersonal.  We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a big deal, but I can see where it could be a bit annoying."}
{"text":"Jess and I went to the West Side Market Cafe this afternoon while shopping the west side market. First off, we thought it was REALLY friendly, so there's a plus right there. Next, the food was pretty decent. Jess had the apple smoked BBQ chicken wrap and I had the smoked salmon BLT. Both were really good, and exceeded our expectations.   As for the decor, it reminded us of an OLD building with really solid concrete brick walls and the smell that goes along with it. But still, great stuff. We enjoyed it and everyone there. Four stars because the food wasn't THAT special, but it was a great retreat in the middle of a crazy market.  As a side note, they don't sell breakfast after 12 on Saturday, which our server was nice enough to tell us right away (when I ordered coffee)."}
{"text":"This place has actually changed quite a bit in both good and bad ways. Let me explain...  No longer are the days of the greasy diner breakfast on the cheap. Oh no--now the prices have gone up quite a bit along with the menu. There are much higher-end, bistro-type selections now, with some unique takes of \"comfort food\" mixed in.   I get it--uppity menu, higher prices.   But, then again, this is the West Side Market Cafe, well known for great, greasy diner fare. There are plenty of places in town, let alone Ohio City, where I can find a fancy brunch and blow a wad of cash. When I come to the WSM Cafe with my boyfriend and his 8 year old for brunch, I'm not expecting an $80 price tag.   The adults also a couple of mimosas and bloody Marys but even these used to be way cheaper (and WAY stronger.) The food was great, although not worth an $80 dip into my pocket.  I'm sad to say that I miss the old diner days of WSM Cafe and my wallet yearns for its return. Le sigh."}
{"text":"Small place and filled with regulars.  A bit on the cold side because of the weather.  Menu is mostly generic but daily specials are not. Make their own chips in house. Sandwiches dominate the menu. Pastrami reuben was nothing special. Neither was the  Cuban. They were good just not inspired.  Prices overall were cheaper than expected (under $10 for most items). Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food (I've never tried lunch or dinner).  Fresh, local ingredients. Good stop while shopping at West Side Market. Great decor.  Recommend the omelet."}
{"text":"I had the wild berry cheese blitz and it was perfect! The lemony cream filling was just right. Portion size was good.  If I could have liked my plate, I would have.  The staff was very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"We came to the Westside Market hungry, and popped into the cafe for breakfast before shopping. I loved my \"Market Hash\" with its generous chunks of spicy andouille sausage (which seemed to be the major component of the dish), potato, green peppers, and onions. My dining companion had three of the thickest pancakes I've think I've ever seen, dusted lightly with powdered sugar and served with a generous helping of fresh fruit...and he said they were quite good as well! Loved the vintage diner atmosphere here, and the wait staff's friendly banter with the regulars. Service was quick and attentive. I'd f'sure be a regular if we didn't live a couple hundred miles away from Cleveland! I also enjoyed the vintage photos on the wall - a couple of photos taken during the market's construction hung above our table."}
{"text":"I went to Cleveland for my birthday and wanted to eat someplace unique to Cleveland. The west side  market cafe was perfect, I loved the energy of the small diner, the food and service was excellent. I had the chorizo scramble wow it was amazing. I wish I lived closer I would eat there often, when I go back to Cleveland it is definitely on my list to visit again."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast, prior to shopping at the WSM.  It is cozy.  Menu has a variety of breakfast staples and omelets.  They also have a liquor license, so you can get mimosas, etc.  I ordered the turkey omelet, my son ordered the southwestern omelet.  Both of them sounded better than they looked or tasted.  The omelet and eggs were a bit greasier than I like and were burned.  Toast was ok.  The server was friendly and attentive.  I do not know how it would be for lunch.  A bit of a disappointment, given the abundance of fresh proteins and produce surrounding them."}
{"text":"Not a big menu but standard and delicious. Service was quick and friendly which was a big plus when eating out with babies."}
{"text":"What a dive! (And not in good way). Food was awful with service to match. What a disappointment. Do yourselves a favor and stay away!!"}
{"text":"Fun and funky breakfast place adjacent to the West Side Market. It's open even on days when the market is not . One of the few places in this area actually open on Sunday (see my review for Great Lakes Brewing Company, ahem.) I thought they could have done better with the coffee. But overall, a great find for a couple of fish out of water folks from Chicago!"}
{"text":"What a nice little place for breakfast.  After wandering around the market for an hour we decided that it was time to fuel up.  This place  is tucked in the corner of the market was playing B52's and was serving breakfast.  The three of us had eggs, hash browns, and toast.  $2.95 a pop.  That was a great price for some really good hash browns and eggs.  The staff was very friendly and took good care of us.  The rest of the menu looked good but sometimes you need runny eggs and toast at a good price."}
{"text":"A fine old school diner!! I went there before a tattoo consultation at nearby Voodoo money and was glad I stopped in. The food was great and after got to sit and sip a beer since my artist was running behind.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I am a FAN of this place. I'd go back again if I lived closer, but I dont. Our main trip to Cleveland was to see an Indians game, but had to take the hubby to go see the West Side Market. On our way there, it was lunchtime, so we decided to try out this cafe. Its a small place, but there's enough room to seat many people. The staff was friendly and took our order quickly. The hubby had the turkey club with fries and I had the Wild Mushroom Grilled Cheese and it was FABULOUS and good. There was enough fontina cheese and mushrooms with just the right amount of stone ground mustard on it. The coolest part was when the fontina cheese was oozin' out the back side of my sandwich. Mmm!!!!!!!   The prices were reasonable for lunch. I dont see it where it is overpriced at all. You definitely get what you pay for.  Great place for a quick lunch or dinner! Highly recommended!!! Cant wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, if you are in town, stop by early in their cafe part. My friend had an amazing corn beef sandwich and I myself, had the best breakfast ever, they're signature omelette. Bravo to the chef and everything was decently priced. I would be a regular if I lived close by. Our waitress was super helpful too and said we wouldn't be disappointed. She was right!"}
{"text":"This gets 3 stars on the diner rating scale. Good food (better than avg diner fare) and very good service. Interesting mix of locals for Sunday brunch before a home Browns game. They serve beer and wine too (was not expecting this) and appear to rotate a seasonal beer too (in addition to Labatt Blue and Shiner Bock -- a combo that always makes me play eeny-meeny-minny-moe)."}
{"text":"A totally decent diner/café right by awesome West Side Market.  In fact, there's a door that connects the café to the market.  My friend brought me here a couple Fridays ago before she and I headed to West Side Market--a totally unnecessary food stop given how much irresistible food is sold within the market!  Nevertheless, our café breakfast was good.  I ordered the tomato and cheese frittata, which was quite nice, and the hash browns that came with the dish were possibly the best I've ever had.    Friend and I sat at the bar where we watched coverage of the Casey Anthony trial--I've been following the case since July 2008 and am absolutely disgusted and appalled that the jury managed to find Anthony NOT GUILTY--and received casual friendly service."}
{"text":"As always, I love this place. The food is always good, fast, and reasonable. It's a must go for me when I'm in Cleveland. I love their sage biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to & loved a New Jersey-style diner - but hated that Jersey hospitality - then West Side Market is the place for you. It's got all the trapping of a Jersey diner, including plastic booths, a bar, Formica, local newspaper clippings all over the walls, a great but simple menu - but it's got a distinctly Midwestern vibe, with friendly servers & hometown pride.  Their menu is ample, & basically anything you get here will be delicious, given that much of the food comes from local vendors whose goods you can buy just next door in the attached West Side Market. I was a HUGE fan of their cornbread waffle, which I expected to be, well, just a waffle, but was in actuality the best, crispiest cornbread I've ever had, topped with piping-hot honey butter & real Ohio maple syrup. My boyfriend wants to branch out but can't seem to stop ordering their reuben sandwich.  The West Side Market doesn't look like much, but it's a Cleveland staple, & it's a perfect tourist spot for your in-town-for-the-weekend visitors. Show 'em what Cleveland's got!"}
{"text":"Touring the market in the morning can work up a large appetite so when my husband and I were finished exploring WSM we went next door to try out the WSM Cafe. The interior is very clean and the atmosphere  gives you a since of being transported back in time to a small town diner which is a pleasant experience.  The cafe is small but they seat and bring your food out really fast.   The food is cheap and very good. They have a large breakfast and lunch menu full of food that will remind you grandma and grandpa's house. I live in Southern Kentucky and the taste of this food is a direct remind of southern food served in the north. I recommend  the WSM Cafe to anyone!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the WSM so I figured I'd give this place a 1st time shot. I hope it was a one time screw up for them or else they should be doomed.   The place was steady but not that busy. I sat myself at the counter & waited for the server. There was a manager(or owner) right in front of me & 3 girls working. I had to get my own menu (which wasnt at the counter), ask someone for  coffee & water & flag them down to order. Not a good impression so far.   Onto the menu, its basically eggs, pancakes & a few misc. items. No big deal, I like simplicity. The Market Hash jumped out to me. Andouille sausage, peppers & onions with potatoes, 2 poached eggs & a creole mustard sauce on top for about $6.25. I seriously think the only part of the meal that saw heat were the eggs. I was biting into raw onion, the diced up pieces of andouille didnt have a single grill mark & the potatoes looked like they were steamed. There wasnt any carmelization on anything. You would think that since potatoes are cheap  there would be a lot of them. Honestly there was about 2 ounces of them.   The better part- the rye toast & the eggs were cooked properly.   The server gave me the bill but never asked if I needed anything or if it was ok. She did give me a coffee refill though. I had to flag them down to take my money. Nobody ever said thank you or if there was something wrong with the meal. I thought that would be obvious since i only ate the eggs & toast.   I am far from a high maintenance. But this visit will be my last."}
{"text":"Wow, what a solid breakfast!  The eggs benedict are simply incredible, and there's something magical about their deep fried hash browns. Best part? Cheap as hell. Go get some good grub in the market and top it off with a hearty cheap breakfast in the Cafe in the back."}
{"text":"The cafe is somewhat cramped and has a diner atmosphere with the white-tiled walls and some Cleveland memorabilia. However, The food, good service, beer selection, all priced reasonably make it a bit better than an average diner.   The pancakes were fluffy and didn't taste like usual diner pancakes [probably was the buttermilk used to make them] and came with real maple syrup! [$1.50 extra]. The hashbrowns were the type from the round press patty, but then mashed up, well fried and crispy without too much oil, plus some green and red peppers. Omelettes were around $6-7 each.   When I went on a Friday morning at 9am or so, the food came out quickly, our server was very friendly and deserves extra kudos. After placing my order for a rolling rock, I saw Summy Shanty listed on a new drafts list. I politely asked our waitress, now behind the bar, if I could switch to a Summer Shanty before I immediately noticed that my RR was already opened. She went out of her way and gave me a Summer Shanty [with a lemon] without charging for the Rolling Rock.  They have a good beer selection with around 5 drafts [Dort, labatt, and summer shanty - yes! ] plus around ten bottles, including some imports like duval.  What a way to start out the spring and summer :)"}
{"text":"delicious breakfast for just five bucks and some change late night menu too  After a bit of turmoil, the Westside Market Cafe is better than ever.  The \"market breakfast\", for five&change, is a bargain.  The quality of bacon is outstanding.  No razor thin slices of salty meat product here folks.  Oh no... This was thick, smokey, flavorful and hearty. Delicious fried potatoes too.  Other breakfast menu items include biscuits and gravy, hash, eggs benedict and such.  Lots of menu items involve product from the market vendors as well.  Nicely adventurous lunch menu as well.  Nothing too extreme, but good stuff with a good bit of whimsy as well.  Beer and wine, good service, and hey!  You get to go to the Westside market as well! I am a fan, and will be a regular.  Carry on."}
{"text":"A nice diner experience - attached to the West Side Market.  Very friendly staff - didn't give us any problem as we walked in with coffee bought at a stall in the market.  A nice egg, hash brown and meat breakfast - properly executed over easy eggs. Give it a try if you're in the market."}
{"text":"Bummer. I guess this indicates inconsistency. In bullet points:  * I called 30 minutes before arriving to check that they serve breakfast all day on Thursdays. I was given a firm \"Yes\" from the gal on the phone. When we arrived, we were the only ones there, and the waitress told us that the chef just decided to stop serving breakfast. When I informed her that I had called 30 minutes ago and was told otherwise, she (with a teeeeeensy bit of fussiness) gave us breakfast menus anyway and we ordered off of them. Did I mention we were the only ones there, and they were still giving us a hard time? * I ordered bacon and the \"berry\" granola, and YIKES. I guess we pissed the chef off, because what came out was seriously disturbing. The bacon looked like it had been torn from a frozen block, and was skimpy and thin. The two strawberries served in my granola were absolutely disgusting, and I'm *shocked* they served them to patrons. Bruised, mushy, discolored and repulsive strawberries (that were suspiciously positioned to hide their spots), and the same with the blueberries. And to top it off, the yogurt was sour. I ate about 1/4 of the small cup of granola before unearthing more repulsive fruit and completely losing my appetite.  * And once again, even though we were the ONLY people in the place,  when I was served my granola, it took about a year to get a spoon for it, and one of the waitresses was boorishly knocking chairs and tables around to sweep, including under our table. The one we were sitting at. Still...the only ones in the restaurant.  All-around miserable experience, I can't believe I was just here a month ago and had such a different one. I'm not willing to risk this endeavor again."}
{"text":"Don't get the grilled cheese with mushrooms. Two dry pieces of toast with a wimpy slice of cheese, a couple mushrooms and some mustard.  This along with some overly cooked chips cost $8. A major ripoff indeed. Had I not had my parents with me who didn't seem sold on getting something to eat from the vendors and walk around with it, I would have never come here. I would rather have had a gyro. Do yourself a favor, skip this place."}
{"text":"What a great surprise to find such a gem attached to the Market. College girls reunion weekend and we were starving after all the shopping! We popped in here and were really surprised by the unique menu.  I had the lamb slider appetizer which was the perfect size for lunch for one. Three little sandwiches, each with a dollop of tomato, cucumber, onion and feta on each.  Sweet potato tots were very tasty, but needed some sort of sauce to accompany.  Two of my friends had the wild mushroom grilled cheese and couldn't put it down."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a weekend trip to Cleveland and let me tell you how amazing the breakfast was. All weekend we had looked for a mom and pop breakfast spot and this was it. Everything made from scratch, service was great. Our waitress was very helpful with us Californians. Would definitely come back here if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"It's a diner attached to a giant market. I mean, really, that's what it is. Get done shopping at the market and then head on over to the attached diner for some quality diner food.  There's nothing crazy outstanding about the place. It's a little loud, because it's busy and it's a diner. The food is giant portions and a little greasy, because it's a diner. It's just a solid diner, really. Diner.  Of course, if you're on vacation and haven't had alcohol in a month like me and therefore are using that as a blanket excuse to day drink, you should know the mimosas here are both strong and served in pint glasses. That is very important information."}
{"text":"A crowded Saturday afternoon and a first time visit to the West Side Market left me and my traveling companions a bit confused as to wear we could eat. Overwhelmed might be a better word. We saw \"West Side Market Cafe\" and made a bee-line for sit down prepared food.  Despite a line, service moved relatively fast. We were squeezed into a table within 5 minutes. At 12:30pm on a Saturday I was informed that breakfast was over. Bummer! Don't they know it's a crime to end breakfast before 2pm on a weekend?  I saw something like \"Crab Spinach and Artichoke Dip\" and ordered a plate of that for our table to share. The chips were a bit stale - in that they were pretty soft and chewy. The Dip was a bit runny and thin and had an overwhelming fishy taste. But I'm a sucker for a good Patty Melt, and the one I got at the West Side Market Cafe was a darn good Patty Melt. It comes with homemade chips, but I would opt for fries the next time after sampling some off of Matthew B.'s plate.  Service was fast and friendly, and I want to return for a shot at the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Traditional american diner with a nice breakfast menu. Good and fast service with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"The WSM Cafe offers a small menu of reasonably priced items. The quality of the food was decent; however, the service was pretty slow.   While I can see the draw of the cafe for market workers, I'm disappointed that we wasted our time and money here when we could have simply eaten our way through the market for breakfast."}
{"text":"Always delicious! I have been a regular at this place for ages. There have been many changes on the menu and with the staff, but the quality is always consistent.   I recently have fallen madly in love with the most gluttonous of their menu offerings...  The BMD or Burger of Mass Destruction. Imagine a delicious double stack of fresh beef, smothered in cheese, topped with crisp veggies, and then placed between two grilled cheese sandwiches... yup that is what I'm talking about. This burger is not for just anyone and it should definitely come with a warning!   Everything else on the menu that I have had the privilege of sampling has been pretty  awesome. Never a dull meal here."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich is the BEST! Soft roll, thick maple syrup bacon, fried egg cooked so the yolk drips. Perfection. Recently tried the pancakes and loved the crispy edges. Breakfast usually runs us $20-25 for 2 people. Can't beat it.  Diner/greasy spoon atmosphere, packed on Saturdays."}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem. Were it not for the friendly olive oil vendor I would have walked right by this little cafe located in a corner of the West Side Market. Prices are reasonable, the food is fresh and they always have a seasonal Great Lakes beer on tap.  I loved my fried perch sandwich and it could have been one of the best I've had - super fresh fish and a lovely fried batter. French fries would have been nice, but the potato chips were the only option.  I've heard that they serve a phenomenal and cheap as anything breakfast!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! !!.Service not much better! !!.Worst breakfast ever!.This place is disgusting! !.They should be ashamed! !!Will never go back!!!.They should close this place!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to go in, 'cause it looked too cutesy -- but my buddy noticed a large table of raucous old people and pointed out to me that \"They ain't gonna throw their money away on crappy food.\"   Later we realized that the waitstaff knew their customer's names -- and there's no better endorsement than customers that keep coming back! Cool old historical pictures of Cleveland on the walls, friendly staff (Hell, everybody in Cleveland seems really friendly) -- on to the food.  The food came out McDonald's-fast (but it wasn't McDonaId's quality, so you get the best of all possible worlds).   I started with a grilled Provolone and grilled cheese, while my buddy got the West Side Market Hash, which turned out to be some kind of New Orleans-influenced breakfast creation with potatoes, eggs Benedict, and exquisite andouille sausage.  The Benedict sauce was a delicious brown, peppery concoction. So then I got hungry, and being in Eastern European Cleveland, I ordered the blintzes, which turned out to be the loveliest pillows of dairy-filled contentment, and also turned out to be accompanied by some lovely hash which turned out to be chopped-up fresh potato pancakes, with lovely bits of fresh, tasty red and green bell peppers scattered amongst them.  Everything -- meat, produce, cheese etc. -- was so fresh I wouldn't be surprised if it comes from the market which houses this restaurant."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place in Cleveland. I had the Eggs Benedict, my friends had pancakes, Benedict Arnold and French Toast. Everyone was really happy with their selections. I came on a Sunday and had no problem finding parking. Saturdays seem really hard to find parking so it seems as if Sunday will be my day to come here. I will return many times as long as I am alive and living in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great breakfast creations!  Love the hash browns. Came here two days in a row for breakfast while in town for family hospital stay at Lutheran Hospital."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a visit this week. The 5 star rating must be qualified, however. I'm not comparing this place to Blue Point or The Metropolitan... I'm comparing this to places like Slymon's. I had the patty-melt and it was just awesome. Also, everyone there was really polite and prompt. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time visitor. Had the chorizo scramble. Highly recommended, added salsa. Chorizo had just enough heat and Monterey Jack was nice and melted.   Staff was friendly and efficient.   Partner said link sausage had that perfect pop when he bit into it.   Right next door is the West Side Marketplace, a fun visit.  Thanks Cleveland yelp for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"You know a place is good when every one else is closing or offering 2 for one specials but at the West Side Market Cafe you still have to wait in line to get in. I first visited the cafe on a really hot day in June because there is a big sign that said \"ice cream\". Guess what? They don't serve ice cream. Apparently the sign is a relic of an ancient incarnation of the space. But stumbling on it like that was a very lucky day for me. Attached to the West Side Market the cafe has easy access to some of the freshest, most flavorable and diverse food in this part of the country. Now I have seen some great food turned mediocre by an inept kitchen. Fortunately the chef (and he is certainly a \"chef\" not not not a short order cook) has mastered the art of creating great dishes out of great food. The breakfast menu is not two eggs over easy bacon and toast. They have three or four variations on eggs benedict. The hash is made with andouille sausage and the pancakes are served with real maple syrup. The hash browns have bits of onion and green and red pepper. Unbelievably good. Lunch and dinner includes perfectly created dishes from the best ingredients at the market. This is food you expect to find at a fine dining establishment and food that fits perfectly at a casual diner. In other words there is something for everyone. The owners are everywhere. Every customer is treated like a long time regular whether it is your first visit or if you have been sitting in the same seat since the day they opened. The service is quick and efficient even on a busy day and your coffee cup is like the cornucopia, it stays filled all day."}
{"text":"I've neever noticed this place until I went to Westside market to get lunch. Not seeing many stand options, I found this place tucked on the side of the market.  This place has good food and a friendly waitstaff. My brother got the fish-n-chips (fried walleye on the menu) and I got a crispy chicken sandwich. When the waitress set down our platters the universal comment was \"this looks good fried\" meaning that it was done the way it should be and not with a removable layer of bland batter. And it was. The food was yummy and i'm looking forward to returning for breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"Came back this weekend for breakfast before I explored the market. Still great - got the same exact thing (why mess with what works?). The place was much busier than my previous visit which I attribute to the market actually being open (I came last time on a Sunday). I got a table quickly though.   Every time I eat here, I want to move to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Brunch is fine but this review is not about brunch.  I joined a couple of girlfriends for lunch at the Cafe.  They split a tuna salad and I got the chicken Tortilla salad.  I love salad but somehow this was the worst salad I've ever had.  Bad Salad?  How is that even possible?  The iceberg lettuce was wet, covered with a dollop of a chicken salad kind of mixture.  It was bland and tasteless.  No, really, really bland and tasteless.  As a dressing, I was offered sour cream and salsa.  That's not dressing...I tried it and it just made it gross.  Our waitress was so busy that I just stuffed it down a well as I could ( it was $8 remember) while my friends are their pitiful tuna sandwich and shared about 6 chips total.  I don't know what their profit margins are, but they must be substantial."}
{"text":"Went to the Westside Market on 12/15/2015, heard to go the café for breakfast. I had the Cleveland Mess (layered with potatoes, bacon, cheese, eggs, and country gravy) and toast; my wife had their Market Breakfast (2 eggs, potatoes, meat, and toast). It was fantastic. One of the best breakfasts we've had in a while. Nice atmosphere and great service. A must go to if your in the area."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and great location make this a favorite spot for breakfast. Try the eggs benny, a real winner."}
{"text":"The mushroom grilled cheese is unusual and delish! Don't know what kind of pickles they serve, but they are wonderful. Sweet and dilly at the same time. Huge portions. Excellent lunch!"}
