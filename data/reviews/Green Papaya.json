{"text":"If you enjoy flavoured water instead of tasty curry, frozen meat, slushy vegetables then look no further. An utter insult to Thai food. If this place manages to say open in to the new year it will be the only thing that impresses me with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food ** Service **** Ambience ****  Mediocre food, Good portion sizes. I was told the restaurant has new owners now they are cost cutting, which clearly shows in the quality of their food.   Not recommended"}
{"text":"I might change my rating after I taste their food but at the moment I'm pretty annoyed.  Is it just me or is it kind of funny when a restaurant puts an ad in your home mailbox offering free delivery, takes your order, then tells you when they get to your door that you are outside their delivery area.  Boo."}
{"text":"I had 'dinner for 2' delivered and it was the worst food ever. It was suppose to come with general tao chicken, pad thai, 2 shrimp rolls, and 2 bowls of steamed rice.   Pad Thai was ok. Portion was ok.  2 Shrimp rolls did not exist. Instead I got burnt spring rolls instead.  General tao chicken was soggy fried chicken in a non-flavourful watery sauce.   Food was terrible. Delivery took almost an hour and I live pretty close to the place. It was a waste of my money and my time waiting for dinner to arrive. I will never waste my time and money on this place again.   The person who took my order also hung up on me while I was asking her a question."}
{"text":"Don't order from them online, they don't get the orders. Left me starving with no food on the way. WTF? Way to go!"}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food is sub-par.  We tried a few different dishes, and all were very disappointing.  The food was bland and relatively flavorless....expected much more for the price."}
{"text":"while the flavor was fine, we ordered crispy beef and after eating 3/4 of it, i pick up a piece with a massive white hair in it. Now, i call our server and she tells me they won't cancel the order because we ate 3/4 of the food. Because somehow we were supposed to go fishing into our food before we start eating for hair or other by products. like it was our own fault that we found the hair too late or at the bottom of dish. the manager was an asshole. it my friends kid fav dish and he was visiting from vancouver and then witnessed this crap. then the server said that basically she would have to convince us or it gets taken out of her wages which im pretty sure is illegal. so there u have it...slum practices for workers and refuse to take off dish with a long ass white hair (luckily mine is black and friends is brown) . your choice to support this horrible rest owner. all happened yezterday at 5pm."}
{"text":"Walking around the area and at first wanted to go eat somewhere else, but decided to give this place a try. This place use to be super popular, along with Lemongrass. They were the 'Asian Legend, or Pai Northern Thai Cuisine'. We came in around 7ish and it was very quiet, maybe because of the warm rain temperature.  We started ordering two drinks. My gf got the Ice Lotus Soy. We both tasted, and it was quite powdery like and the flavour is quite light. (Didn't like it) I got the 'Passion Fruit Juice'. And it had a sweet/sour taste. Which is the norm for this fruit, but this is the plus that it even had this juice. (Rarity in resto)  I got a pre-fixed dinner for $19 which gives you a soup, app and the main with dessert.  Lemongrass Veggie Soup- Consist of beansprouts, tomato, onion, cilantro, lemongrass. The broth for me was kind of boring and it tasted sour which I presume is how lemongrass taste. Not really an exciting soup.  Chicken Satay/Mango Salad- You get two skewer of chicken with peanut sauce. This is cooked well. Chicken was not dry, and tasted fine with the peanut sauce. Mango salad was okay.  They called the main \"Drunken Shrimp w/ Pad Thai\", but it turns out its actually \"Garlic Shrimp w/ Pad Thai\". The taste in general of this dish is okay, but not so good. Maybe average at best. The pad thai is ketchup flavoured (no tofu btw). This place did say on the door that they're 'Pan Asian' cuisine, so they may not have much signature items.  My gf had the 'Glass Noodle w/Chicken'. Chicken was moist in pieces, and noodle tasted fine with sauce. I would say its better than my pad thai.  Overall: Food is okay. Service style is drop your food to your table and leave you alone. We didn't get any water when we ordered our beverage. This is likely a one-time trial deal for us."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on Yonge street just above Eglinton, Green Papaya is a great eat if you live in the area. They have fast service, and a good selection of Thai food reasonably priced. Their dinner deal is wonderful, and if you do take out and pay cash you even get 10% off. I typically have the Pad Thai but most of their dishes are standard Thai ."}
{"text":"best asian fusion in the city"}
{"text":"It doesn't taste like authentic thai-vietnamese cuisine restaurant. Their papaya salad is the worst (I only smell and taste of strong vinegar). Their Thai ice tea is lack of strong flavour of the tea and quiet too sweet for me. And the Pad Thai is too soggy. 1 star is only for their decor and location."}
{"text":"Was here for a late dinner with a friend. The food was incredible! We ordered the shrimp platter appetizer, chicken pad-Thai and finished off with Lychee martinis. I highly recommend the pad Thai, it's The BEST in the city. So delicious. Good pad Thai is hard to find. This place is great! ! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome set menu for about $15 and fast service! My favourite items would have to be the laksa noodle soup, green curry, curry pad thai and shanghai noodles. They also have a pretty extensive drink menu for a thai restaurant. regular customer! :)"}
{"text":"Green Papaya is a Thai & Vietnamese restaurant that has a variety on their menu. Their menu includes: stir-fried noodle dishes, fried rice, curries, pho, a variety of wok dishes, dim sum, soups etc. They also have gluten free options.  The interior here is clean, modern and sleek- nothing too special. The food here is a hit or miss and the portions for a lot of the dishes are small.  I've tried plenty of their dishes overtime and been disappointed with almost all of them. Their pad thai is nothing special, some of the stir-fry noodle dishes are bland and the tomato pho was disgusting. I remember trying their house speciality- five spices chicken ($11.99) and the chicken had so much fat around it that it was hard to eat. However, I did enjoy their Thai seafood fried rice ($10.99)- it had a good amount of shrimps, calamari, crab meat mixed with eggs. I also like their iced ginger honey tea. For dessert, I had the mango sticky rice ($5.99) they gave you a handful of black sticky rice and it was sweet, creamy and delicious, but the mango slices were not ripe and were somewhat bitter.  The staff here can be friendly but each time I came here I experienced slow service which put a downer on the dining experience. The price is reasonable but not worth it if the food is not generally good and the service is bad.  Overall, Green Papaya is not my favorite place for Thai or Vietnamese food. I generally tend to walk across the street and walk a block north towards Sorn Thai if I'm craving good Thai food and a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere and decor was modern and nice. The waiters quickly seated us and were welcoming. We started off with their mango martini and sangria. Then, we tried some of their appetizers. Their mango salad was very tasty and tangy, which was savoury. We also had their tom yum chicken soup, which is one of the best ones I've tried as it was tasty and had a fragrant broth. For entrees, we decided to go with their signature dish pad thai, which was delicious. Their noodles were cooked perfectly and it was the perfect balance of sweet and a little bit sour, making it an amazing and recommended dish. The green curry chicken was a bit spicy, but tasted great alone with the jasmine rice on the side. We also ordered their thai pineapple fried rice, another one of their signature dishes, which was one of my favourites entrees. As for dessert, we redeemed for the mango ice cream and tried their fried banana which was surprisingly good. Overall, the modern atmosphere, reasonable prices, amazing food, and quick and efficient service makes this one of my absolute favourite thai restaurant. Definitely recommend this restaurant to people who are around the area who are looking for a place to eat tasty and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Stylish, fast, clean, speedy service. Lunch specials are a good deal. Spring roll + small salad + pho/ fried rice/ pad thai combo is under $8 after tax. Pad thai was a little too moist for me and the beef pho was very plain (no basil leaves, lime, hot sauce, seafood sauce, etc).  My roommate is obsessed with their sticky rice. Would not go out of the way but it's right around the corner from my condo so I go there from time to time anyway."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while I was with a friend. We ended up ordering the rolls, coconut soup and pad Thai. The soup was decent but overall the food was bad. Not your traditional Thai fare. Most of the rolls lacked flavour or was too greasy. One of them even had the freezer burn taste. Yuk! The chicken used in the dish (rolls, soup and pad Thai) had a pretty bad taste to it. Would def not go here again. Service was decent."}
{"text":"That was probably the worst pad Thai I have ever had. Tried their cashew chicken too: meh... not good either."}
{"text":"The food was good and so was the service. This place is ok priced (10-15$ per person for an entree), which is maybe a little more expansive than other Thai restaurants, but you pay for the ambiance and the location. The decor is nice too. I would definitively go back there."}
{"text":"The mango chicken tastes like Lean Cuisine. I could make something better in the microwave. I ordered the pad Thai, but requested their peanut lime sauce instead of the tamarind sauce. As the waiter was serving the rest of my family, he informed me that the chef was not able to do this. It was a simple request: just substitute the sauces, so I didn't understand why they couldn't do this. I ordered the Indonesian satay vermicelli instead because it had the peanut sauce, but I couldn't taste the peanut sauce at all! I don't even think they put any peanut sauce on. The noodles were very mediocre and I couldn't finish it. Mr. Noodles is more appetizing.   The only good thing about the restaurant was the relatively fast service."}
{"text":"I've been working in the area almost a full year now, and this is the only spot that was a let-down.   I had ordered a vietnamese coffee and a Pad Thai. The coffee tasted okay, but had a lot of the liquid had been spilled onto the outside of the glass. The Pad Thai consisted of mushy, overcooked noodles, what must have been a pre-packaged sauce that was wayyyyyyy too sweet, bland, chewy chicken, and leeks/green onions that had been chopped and left out for far too long.  The dishware and cutlery weren't quite up to my standard of clean, but not awful. The glasses were pretty smudged up though.  The service was fast, but it wasn't at all busy, so I can't say how they'd hold up on peak hours. The man serving me was also very abrupt and just seemed like he really didn't want to be there. Can't blame him for that, really."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite weekend lunch spots.   The food is always tasty and the lunch specials make the food seem even better!  Recommend trying out one of their combos, but I know a lot of people enjoy a big bowl of noodles too!  The restaurant can be a little noisy - but wouldn't let that keep you away!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing about our delivery experience was that they were professional on the phone and it was delivered in literally 15/20 minutes.    The food was horrible though.  Fried rice wasn't fried...just white rice with some egg and barely cooked shrimp.  The Tamarind veggie mix was INEDIBLE....my few bites have actually made me feel nauseous from the vinegar taste.  The coconut chicken mushroom soup was ok but watery.  The veggie spring rolls were very basic and flavorless as was the sauce.  The mango fresh roll was pretty good but was missing something.  Maybe other menu items are better or this was not typical, I don't know.  We will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Green Papya multiple times, both for take-out and eating in. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. I usually get the beef pho while my boyfriend gets the curry pad thai, and we share some mango rice paper rolls. I tried the vermicelli bowl once and it was awful, but everything else I've tried has been fantastic. Very nice service too."}
{"text":"one of my fave places for lunch :) they have a good variety of lunch combo's all under $6.99-$10.99, salad, wonton/veggie soup/ and spring roll plus a main (noodle/curry) - so flavorful and made fresh. the service is fast, plus their lunch is till 4pm which is pretty good in my books (cos not everyone can make it to lunch between 12 and 2!) the restaurant itself is clean and very chic. the staff is friendly. but mainly i'm in love with the lunch combo's cos they're such a good deal, and its not like servings are small, they're a decent size (i always have a doggy bag). i haven't really been here for dinner though cos i find its a bit pricey and there's a less expensive (and equally good) thai place across the street (mai thai), but green papaya's lunch def ROCKS!!!  around $8-10 per person.   must try: lunch combo, wonton soup, spring roll, curry fried rice. and green curry........actually u can't go wrong with anything on the menu! i've pretty much tried it all :))"}
{"text":"Love the free mango ice cream u get when u check in on yelp!! and their wonton soup is so good.  One of the best lunch spots in the Yonge/Eglinton area."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in the area! Have loved it since the first time I went. It's our default if we can't decide on what to order, for years now. They've never got an order wrong. We've never waited too long for delivery or our meal in the restaurant. The staff always seem a bit rushed but they're eager to please. The food is top notch and there's a LOT of it. One delivery order of pad thai or fried rice will easily last you 3 meals."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place, but was pretty let down. We ordered:  - Veg Shanghai Noodles - Veg Black Pearl Pad Thai - Veg Vietnamese Taro Spring Rolls - Veg Dumplings  Everything was just so plain! The Taro Spring Rolls tasted like KFC to me (which is not at all appetizing!) and everything else was just boring. Even slathered with a bunch of Siriachi and some Hoisin sauce to spice it up it was only just okay.   Will probably not order from here again, though we had such high hopes we may give it another shot, the menu seemed good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious,  excellent service,diversity on menu and great service, will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This place has it all - The friendliest staff, delicious food, and fair prices! My boyfriend and I live in the area and come here at least once a week. We have never once had anything less than stellar service and food here. Love it!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to get a regular Asian fusion fare at a decent price point. I stick with pho wonton soup, and sometimes spring rolls platter. Hubby tried several dishes, and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"Excellent good...very \"white, sterile\" decor...I thought it was much nicer before their renovation....but still great."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here a while back and both enjoyed it! The restaurant is not too busy and the waiting service is good! The food was good and for the portion and price, it was worth it. Green Papaya is not my favourite thai place, but if I'm in the area and really wanting thai, I definitely know where to stop by."}
{"text":"Through orderit.ca I had Green Papaya delivered for dinner  Worst pad thai I have ever had.  I think I would find more flavour licking a lamp shade.  Really?!  Really?!  This isn't pad thai.  It is bbbllllaaaahhhhh thai noodles with poor quality shrimp and chicken.  There was hardly any sauce to speak of.  No lime, no peanuts.  Wow...shameful.  Along with my lame pad thai, I also ordered prawn rolls.  The presentation was the best part (see attached).  There was no seasoning and the quality was really missing.  If you are looking for good, flavourful thai - skip this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good, solid Thai food.  Weird service from a terribly contrary server  Food: - Vege Spring Rolls: Eh. Have definitely tasted better. But at $3.99 for 4 pieces, passable - Seafood Red Curry: I wanted it extra spicy but the rude server basicaly said \"it's Already Spicy\". Well, Mister, it WASN'T, so there. When a customer politely asks for it to be extra spicy, just make it extra spicy and don't be rude. The shrimps were plenty and quite large and otherwise tasty.   The server was rude to my friend too...i don't know what his deal was, but whatever. Not coming back even i wanted to like it, since it's 2.5 blocks from my apt"}
{"text":"Wanted some Thai takeout on a Friday night and wanted to try something new. Green Papaya had an extensive menu with tons of yummy sounding items to choose from. I ordered the spicy steamed dumplings, mango salad and green curry (chicken).  The dumplings themselves were alright but the spicy peanut sauce was totally flavourless with the texture of gooey peanut butter. The green curry was watered down, flavourless and chicken had an almost chewy/slimy texture, not to mention the chicken was giant sliced pieces which made it hard to eat. Mango salad was ok, half of the container was just pieces of lettuce and there were 4 small pieces of red pepper on top. I was so disappointed I didn't finish the curry and threw it out. I just kept saying out loud, \"so disappointing,\" as I tried each item. I will never return as the food was flavourless, small portion sizes and it was $25.00. Not impressed."}
{"text":"From the outside, I never really found Green Papaya that interesting.  I've past it a million times, and never gave it a second thought.  The only reason why I came here was because of Yelp (thank you Yelp!).  I searched for Thai places in this area, and figured a bunch of 4 star ratings don't suck.  I went there, and it was very good.  They had a great prix fixe menu that was both affordable and kept you satisfied.  I feel like I can't give this place 5 stars since I've only had one meal there.  I guess I have to go back! Anyone want to come with??"}
{"text":"I had ordered the lemongrass chicken vermicelli as takeout but they gave me pork instead.  The pork was sour and i wasn't able to finish my meal.  The whole dish was drenched in oil.  Quite upset."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. I ordered fresh rolls and dumplings. Fresh rolls are light and really delicious. The dumplings were filling.  Place is clean and spacious. Friendly service. Next time I'm trying a main course."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars. Nothing really wrong with this place, but not spectacular either.  Ordered the lunch special - Bangkok chicken w/steamed rice, spring roll and lemon veggie soup.    Lemon veggie soup - good flavour, not spicy, but fresh.  3.5/5 Spring Roll - it was acceptable. 3/5 Bangkok chicken w/steamed rice - 2/5. Rice was dry and not moist (felt like it had been in a fridge or they didn't add enough rice to the rice cooker) and chicken was chewy and I expected it to be crispy.    While cheap ($8.50), I'd probably rather go to Lemongrass in the Yonge-Eglinton food court for Thai fusion type food."}
{"text":"Oh dear, oh dear!   Stranded in Yonge and Eglinton on a Friday night with a group of friends, we headed to Green Papaya for dinner as our other plans had fallen through.  We were all very hungry and the service was quick, the restaurant looked clean and was quite empty...given how late it was that wasn't too surprising.   Our food arrived quickly and so far so good.  Up until my friend found a bug (possibly cockroach) in her food that she was sharing with her husband (it was dead and had been cooked with the food).   That for me was the end right there; unfortunately I was sick (I have a very weak stomach when it comes to these things) we waited for the rest of our party to finish and we left.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I used to live in the neighborhood and would go for lunch here. Great specials and affordable. Loved pad Thai and noodle soup. Really good spot and recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed in a take out order than I was ordering their pad Thai. Paid for chicken and shrimp -- no shrimp came in the container. Pad Thai tasted like watered ketchup. It was so bad I second some of the other posts who stated they were also disappointed. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is the curry we also ordered was received well by guests. There is much better Thai in area."}
{"text":"Have had lunch here a couple of times because I work in the area. They have a lot of lunch specials for a very reasonable price. I always order the chicken pad thai and I manage to have enough left over for it to be another meal. Service is good - quick and efficient. As mentioned, I find the lunch specials to be very reasonable. For under ten dollars, I get a starter salad with a spring roll and a generously portioned pad thai dish. The last time I dined here, I also ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee, which was super tasty.  Anyway, when I need a quick lunch, I usually go to Green Papaya as you can't go wrong here.  Good for: lunch"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Green Papaya since 2011. Living in the neighborhood, we visit this place  for \"lazy\" lunches/ dinners quite often. Food is  reasonable priced. Menu is simple but attractive enough. What else do we really need?  Last night I was there with my friend.  We both ordered traditional beef dishes (oyster and blackbean).  When we got them, dishes looked absolutely identical. The only difference was a disproportion of broccoli and meat ( lots of broccoli!) in the blackbean dish.   There was actually no sauce at all. In combination with steamed rice, it was very dry. When we mentioned it to our server, he said they remove sauce because we care about our customers. Actually this waiter (seems to be new and related to the owner) was arguing with any comments/suggestions we tried to express. At the end of our diner he did not like our decision regarding tips,  threw receipt on a table and demonstratively walked away.  Never before had I seen such disrespectful behavior.  Our evening was destroyed and after more than 3 years our relationship with this restaurant we decided not to come back there again."}
{"text":"This is a stylish little Thai restaurant that offers up some great cuisine. I've had a few different dishes now and have been very much impressed. As an added addition, they have some great dinner specials; for $14 you get a soup, salad, entree and rice! Great deal, try it out!"}
{"text":"Surprised that the reviews aren't so great for this restaurant! My friend and I ordered a chicken pad Thai and lemon grass shrimp. Both taste pretty good! I personally can't eat a lot of spice so I really like the taste of the pad Thai (not too spicey). Our servers are also really nice and we each received a free ice cream by checking into Yelp! Pretty decent place so I'll definitely visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Servers were very attentive. However the food was mediocre.  Ordered the green curry chicken and the sauce was very light tasting, not very strong and it was very watery. Portions are okay however the food did not taste authentic."}
{"text":"The salad and pho were average. It's probably the worst Thai/Vietnamese restaurant in the neighbourhood. The service was also really bad, the waitress was impatient and disrespectful. Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is a great go-to for a pad thai fix. It is reasonably priced and whenever I go, the wait doesn't seem very long since I have never been there when the restaurant was packed. I have also tried their mango salad rice paper wraps-- also very good. I would definitely go again and again!"}
{"text":"Love this place - I found this place while craving a big break from Springrolls' Tom Yum Goong soup.  What really lured me was their set dinner for $14.99 - soup, springroll and entree. They definitely don't skimp on the meat - I ordered a coconut chicken and it was all white meat.  But what really sold me on this place was their lemongrass soup - it's like a lighter twist of the tom yum, and if you order the veggie version they load it up with tons of veggie (and believe it or not, theres some bits of pineapple in it).   You MUST go try it! Especially if you're feeling like detoxing and going light, order this soup and you're good to go. You'll feel clean the next day. And it makes you sweat while you're enjoying it. That alone is worth the price."}
{"text":"I love their tom yum soup and am addicted to black been everything I love their black bean sauce it's amazing. Service is decent and the prices are as well. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Modern space with quick service in a contemporary sit-down setting. Perfectly good Thai food, and BRILLIANT lunch combos (2 or 3 \"courses\").Regular a la carte prices are reasonable too.Fresh ingredients AND they deliver!"}
{"text":"It was horrible thai restaurant i've been..... moreover, water had some bad smell"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place about 7 times but I haven't been back since my last visit.  I ordered the mango chicken plate with brown rice.  I knew as I started eating the food that something wasn't right - the chicken tasted like bad meat.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of continuing to eat it.  I left disappointed and ended up going to the movies with my gf.  We couldn't even finish the movie as I started to feel really sick - started to shiver and feel really light headed.  I am not a doctor or expert so I can't say for certain that it was the bad meat that caused my sickness, but the experience itself has led to me not going back again to this restaurant.  To be fair, the food was not bad the other 6 times that I went there.  I may have given them a second chance had I not gotten sick after but now it is too risky to return."}
{"text":"I have only been to Green Papaya a handful of times but I have to say that it has become one of my favourite thai places.  The menu itself offers a large array of choices, so if you are looking for a light meal, a huge dinner or a specific chicken, beef, seafood or veggie dish, they probably have it!  Here is my full meal description for you...  The starters range from $3 to $10, depending on the item. My personal faves are the fresh mango or chicken salad roll or the veggie Vietnamese spring rolls.  For the main event, I would recommend the following for everyone, which includes all meat eaters and veggie people:  - Shrimp and veggies with the blackbean sauce ($15)  - Mango Chicken with veggies, topped with ginger and basil ($14)  - Thai Spicy Blackbean Veggies, mixed with garlic ($12)  - Pad Thai... the traditional kind! It comes with chicken, shrimps, eggs and tons of veggies ($11)  - Classic Wok Beef with tons of ginger garlic and teriyaki sauce ($12)   As you can see, I am a bit of an expert when it comes to Green Papaya.  And for the backdrop of your meal, you will be in a very blank canvas, with a sterile atmosphere (that my boyfriend loves!).  If you love Thai or are looking to try it for the first time, go midtown to Green Papaya or go home!"}
{"text":"- Lunch combos are at a reasonable price - Food tastes great! I suggest the crispy squid  - Also been here for dinner, and their combos are fantastic. You get choice of wonton soup or lemon veggie soup, an appetizer of springs rolls and mango salad, and a wide variety of main course selections  - Their coconut ice cream is delicious, with real coconut bits in the ice cream  - will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I ordered the sauteed lemongrass shrimp with rice. It tasted quite inisipid and bland. The next day I came down with a bad case of diarrhea, which I can't positively pin on the last night's dinner, but make up your own mind. I most likely won't be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how to rate this place, because it has its good points and bad points.  Bad news first.  My chicken pad thai was tasteless.  When I go to a place where pad thai is available, it's probably what I would order for myself.  With that being said, I've had my fair share of pad thai.  I've never been to Thailand, so by default, I have no sense of what is \"authentic\" or not.  It's really a matter of preference in taste I'd say, but this one, NO TASTE.  I can't understand how food can be so tasteless.  I had to ask for Sriracha hot sauce, just so that I can taste something and this is something I've never added on my pad thai...*never ever*.  I just wanted to be able to taste something.  The good stuff.  Well, the noodles were made to my preference.  It was soft, but not soggy.  The bean sprouts were crunchy enough, but not under cooked.  The actual technical cooking of it was good and the size was reasonable. I was full at the end of my meal, but I was not satisfied.   I thought it was just me, so I actually planned on going back for a different dish. When I told my coworker about my experience, she also thinks the place is terrible. She ordered Thai Curry and she said of all the places she's been to, they are the worst.   Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"On a never-ending quest to find reliably good Asian delivery in Forest Hill, we decided to place an order from Green Papaya. Twas a cold wintry night, so we ordered:  Chicken wonton pho - verdict: great! Yummy broth, excellent little chicken wontons. Very tasty.  Spicy thai tom yum soup with chicken - verdict: pretty good.  Crispy beef - verdict: excellent! One of the better versions of this dish that I've tried via local delivery...great ginger/soy/sesame flavour. Though by the time we cracked it open, it definitely needed a crisp-up in the oven...5 minutes or so did the trick.  I'd order again from here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I just order the right stuff or this place was just not that good during my visit. None of the flavors seemed to fuse together well. The salt balance was off. The Thai tamarind soup was awful - I had to send it back. The mango salad was refreshing but not at all like really yummy ones I've had elsewhere. The spring rolls were very oily. The satay tasted like chicken skewers with a peanut sauce strewn on top - vs like a nice warm flavorful appetizer that would melt in your mouth. Drunken shrimp was literally sautéed shrimp in olive oil & garlic with some peppers & green onions - nothing Thai about it  - I could have made it at home. Sticky rice with mango was good. Coconut ice cream was yummy. Make sure they actually have what's listed  on the menu under their preset dinners before you order it. That was a miss with our experience this time as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant had great customer service.  My green thai curry with veggie was alright.  I wish the gravy was a bit more thicker (and that's how I like my curry).  Nevertheless, the service was fast and you do not have to wait too long for your food."}
{"text":"Good lunch combos and ambience! Modern restaurant that is great for families.   Made a catering order for my office that went really smoothly! Free delivery over $20."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Green Papaya and yet I've somehow never reviewed the joint. A visit on a recent Friday night has provided me with the opportunity to change that.  I'm a noodle guy so I decided to try the Malaysian Noodles (\"rice noodles w/ chicken & shrimp, egg & beansprouts in spicy miso paste\") and I asked for them extra spicy.  The dish came to the table less than five minutes later, before we'd even received our drinks. My dining companion wouldn't receive her food for another five minutes, but at least her appetizer arrived at the same time as my food.  It's a good dish. I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it arrived to the table piping hot and it had a good mix of flavors. The chicken and shrimp was relatively plentiful, and the noodles were cooked well. The food would definitely not quality as \"extra spicy,\" but there was at least some heat going on.  I should also note they've got a pretty extensive drink menu, with all their alcoholic beverages coming in at under $10 (which is no small feat in this day and age). I tried an Appletini for the first time in my life and it was pretty darn tasty. I get it, J.D. I get it."}
{"text":"I have to be honest - I find most Thai restaurants to be very similar to each other.  (If anyone knows a place for a truly unique Thai experience, please share).  This one though I think is a slight cut above many of the others.  Very large menu and I always find the food to be nice and tasty.  They have a patio on Yonge Street where I recently thoroughly enjoyed a nice glass of white wine with my meal on a warm evening.  They also have a great dinner special where for $15 or so you get a soup, mango salad, choice of one of about 6-8 entrees, and rice.  I've also had mango and sticky rice for dessert - the rice is awesome (it's black rice) although the mango they served with it was not ripe enough."}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab takeout today on my way home. The restaurant itself is very nice inside- well maintained and clean. I ordered the veggie pad Thai with a veggie spring roll. The spring roll was very delicious! Literally one of the best I've had in a while. The pad Thai however was mostly rice noodle and few veggies. The sauce was also not very flavorful and I found myself adding a lot of the chili sauce to it. Wouldn't recommend the pad Thai."}
{"text":"We discovered this place when we first move to the Yonge and Eglinton area and I can say its one of my favourite restaurants in this area. Food is always fantastic, service is great and delivery is a bonus! I even introduced it to some of my family and every-time they visit they always ask if we can eat at Green Papaya. Never have had a bad meal from here."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in the yonge and eglinton area hands down. So cheap and so much food and nice place to eat in.   their dinner, which i've never been to, seems the same. Good good value."}
{"text":"I planned on bringing food home for my roommate and I so I went in to Green Papaya and asked how long it would be for a take out order.  The server said 10 minutes max.  I made my order, paid and went to a couple stores while I waited.  I figured the wait would probably be closer to 15 minutes so I took my time and then went back.  From here I waited and waited while the server kept assuring me my order was coming up next.  After a total of 30 minutes I asked her to check again or bring me the spring rolls I ordered because I was starving!  As I looked on I knew something wasn't right.  She was frantically sorting through orders and looked very panicked.  When she returned she said they had no idea where my order was.  Disappointed, I said \"while you look for it, could you please bring me one of my spring rolls?\".  She said she could not do this until she found the order - she was the one who took my order and payment and recognized me, just didn't want to do it til the order was located.  She called the manager on his cell and found out that he had taken the food thinking it was a delivery order.  She asked me to wait for him to return and still did not get me something to eat.  When the manager returned it had been 45 minutes since my order was placed and he barely apologized and handed me the bag.  The server nicely opened the food bag and gave me one of the soggy spring rolls since she knew I was desperate for something.  I ate the spring roll standing up and the only offer they made was a glass of water.  I was not expecting a refund or anything, but I feel like they could have been more apologetic for the error or maybe even given me a small salad to hold me over.  By the time I got home the food wasn't hot anymore and everything had a lot of condensation on it.  I think the food is pretty good if you eat there but the service could definitely use some work."}
{"text":"VIBE  I was craving a big meal and I hadn't been here for years, so I thought I'd give their pad thai a try again. It's very minimalistic looking in here. It's light and airy and if you sit near the front, you can people watch through the windows.  Service is okay. It's not bad but it's not exceptional.   I ATE  The lunch special: $.799 for a vegetarian spring roll and chicken pad thai. Not a bad deal! But this is the thing: Khao San Road set the standard for Pad Thai and it has now ruined every other thai resto in the city for me.   The thai spring roll tasted like this: get some cabbage and wrap it up in a fried phyllo. Ugh.   The pad thai was goopy, glunky and egg, chicken, and onions slopped together with some peanuts on a plate. The noodles had some red colouring on them. It just tasted ...ugh. I won't go back for this, that is for sure.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I think I felt green from it all. Again, Khao San Road is downtown and worth the wait. That said, I'll still look for something a bit better in the Thai department in this neighbourhood. I would like to hear your suggestions."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE COCKCROACH IN YOUR FOOD!!!  Eight of us visited this premise on October 12, 2012.  My husband and I ordered one ginger beef to share, two other people ordered ginger beef as well.  While eating I discovered a dead cockcroach (~1cm long) in my dish.  I showed it to my table to confirm it was a dead bug, then notified the waiter and manager of the restaurant.  My friend puked after the sighting.  I got sick as well and puked at the restaurant.  While I was in the washroom, there was an insect flying around the bathroom stall.  The manager apologized and claimed that each dish was cooked separately.  The manager still charged everyone except the ginger beef dish that had the cockcroach.  I had diarrhea for the next two days.   I reported this incident to Dinesafe and the restaurant was inspected on October 18.  They found a few dead cockroaches in a glueboard positioned near an area of wall in disrepair.  Failure to cover food from contamination, improper maintenance and sanitation of surfaces and equipment were also noted in the inspection."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time. 1)  The veggie spring rolls were crispy and delicious. 2)  the green mango salad was the best part of the meal - nice, sweet and tangy. 3)  the pho was unfortunately not good at all.  The noodles were soggy and overdone, the broth was very, very oily and it didn't come with any accompaniments like the bean sprouts, onion, cilantro, etc.  There was an odd bean sprout in the broth but not much.  Overall it was ok, but there are so many choices on Yonge St, I probably won't be trying again."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Asian Restaurant, and    this one is on my top five! (Trust me, I know. I only rate, if I'm impress with Foods and Services.) The space of the restaurant is a little bit small but it's welcoming and it's just right once you start drinking your soft-drink, cocktail or whatever maybe. The only downside is that they have small space."}
{"text":"My hubby, 11 month old baby and I came here for late lunch. It was pretty empty at that time. There was only one waitress who seemed to have been misunderstanding orders for more than couple customers.   Besides that, food was mediocre...we had green mango salad, iced coffee, chicken satays, Szechuan spicy tofu with cashews, some beef dish ( sorry, can't remember the name) and got chef to make tofu satays. Tofu Satays was okay, wish it was marinated to get crispy taste like chicken, but glad chef agreed to try something different.   Overall, place and food were okay, may return if in area."}
{"text":"The service is very efficient. Being vegetarians, we find a lot of choice in soups, wok, stir fried and fried rice dishes."}
{"text":"I was craving Pad Thai when I came to Green Papaya for a weeknight dinner with the family, so I ordered the Pad Thai.  I am still craving Pad Thai.  Green Papaya isn't a terrible restaurant, and it's clear that they're at least trying. The \"Pad Thai\" that I got was fairly edible, and the Tom Yum soup we had wasn't bad either. But Green Papaya, despite its name, isn't really a Thai Restaurant. It's another one of those pan-Asian restaurants specializing in sugary General Tso's chicken and half-assed renditions of other Asian specialties. They have some decently priced combos and the food isn't too bad, but I'm tired of going to these places.  Give me some real food. The kind that people eat.  I did get a small scoop of ice cream for checking in on Yelp, which was kinda cool.  As with my earlier review of Thai Island, I might actually be able to recommend Green Papaya if you really like mediocre whitewashed Asian food."}
