{"text":"The pizza here is phenomenal. The salad was very good. The dessert, OMG. Passing this place by is a huge mistake. Oh, the staff, awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and we both loved the ambiance created by the low lighting and thoughtful decor. The outdoor seating area is very nice too. We had great service.  My boyfriend had the half calzone half pizza and substituted pepperoni for the ham. I had the Vegetarian pizza. The reason I gave this restaurant three stars is because my boyfriend said his pizza was \"tasteless\". I didn't taste it since I don't eat meat. As for me, I usually only get white pizza's when I get a pizza but Ciao Grazie doesn't have a white pizza on their menu so that's why I got the Vegetarian. I didn't love the Vegetarian but I'm not surprised about that because I really only ever order white pizzas. We won't be going back but the restaurant itself is lovely along with the staff."}
{"text":"I have now been to Ciao Grazie about dozen times and sampled all of their pizzas and some of their appetizers and desserts. What a gem this place is! I have eaten a lot of pizza in my lifetime but theirs is now an absolute favorite. The goat cheese, prosciutto and basil pizza is to die for and I hope it ends up on the permanent menu. They have perfected the pizza crust!  The service is top notch and genuinely friendly and they even have live music on the weekends.  I still need to check their entrees but I just can't get beyond their pizzas...  :)"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and the staff is great, attentive and accommodating. We go here regularly and always leave happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Ciao Grazie 3 times in the past 2 weeks and each time we had a delightful experience. The staff is friendly, offers great recommendations and remember their clientele.   Happy Hour is from 3:00-6:00 and all appetizers and several pizzas are half price-which is a great deal for the amount and quality of the food.   We tried the bruschetta mixto and have to say that the salmon bruschetta was by far my favorite while my husband raved about the sausage and cheese variation. The pesto bruschetta was a bit overwhelming with the amount of garlic but still good. When I go back I will be ordering the salmon bruschetta so I can enjoy more than 1 piece!  The pizza is amazing-5 STARS for both the margarita and pepperoni.   Ciao Grazie is a must try!"}
{"text":"Dear...!! R 2 waitress ...*twins an r the cutest. .ever..!!!:)pizza great an we r picky....!!!!! Lovely atmosphere. .very pretty and very  groove music... Dessert was orgasmic...!!! Lol  ;))))((  xo"}
{"text":"Really like the new changes at the bar. New bar stools and bar top tables are first class. As always food and service was top shelf. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a really great time here with my friends from out of town. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Oh my god , delicious Italian food I can't stop thinking about. Definitely recommend their Manicotti. Very Yummy!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and Kevin was very helpful with suggestions on great wines and very tasty dishes.  The pizzas are great, salads very fresh, and there is a great selection of wines.  We look forward to returning to this great place!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Ciao Grazie many times because we live nearby. They have great service and gluten free pizza options plus they state that they use some locally grown ingredients. I like the gluten free pizza a lot, but it's not the best out there and sadly they often cook it so the edges are burnt a bit too much. Still, it's nearby and gluten free so we eat there more often than not.   They also claim to have truly wild caught salmon. For this, I sing their praises because so few restaurants offer wild caught fish.   They have a good happy hour with pizza special prices."}
{"text":"The pizza was terrible and we tried four different kinds. The crust was either burnt or under cooked and had no flavor. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"After reading my review, the manager (Kevin) invited me back for another try. I am happy to say that my mind has been changed. As I mentioned in my previous post, the food was good but the service is what did me in. According to Kevin, that issue has been resolved. I had the Salmon Bruschetta and a Roast Beef Panini for lunch and both were terrific....so was the wine and service! Just like every person deserves a second chance, so does every restaurant, especially if the management is willing to reach out, apologize and invite you back.  Thank you to Kevin and Ciao Grazie for their hospitality, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good wood fired thin crust simple pizza. Service is always good. If you skip all other entrees and stick to the pizza you'll enjoy it and come back.   If you come with small children and the weather is nice, sit outside. A bit cramp inside for active little ones."}
{"text":"terrible service...food ok but they had 2 server's covering the whole place the night we went and waiting for a pizza took up to an hour...and its not so good that it's worth the wait. too bad because we were hopeful for this neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Everyone kept saying this place wasn't that great, but it's so close my home that I decided to try it. I loved it and will be back! The wine selection is EXCELLENT. I had the margarita pizza and the Emiliana salad. The pizza was great and the salad was very fresh and light. The food was served very fast. Totally recommend this local gem. I think they have live music on Saturday nights too!"}
{"text":"Almost always empty and you understand why with the very so-so service. I don't know how this place manages to stay in business as there are lots of better places to go in the area. Popped in for a beer during 'happy hour' and I was the only person on the terrace. When I queried the full price, I was informed by the owner that happy hour prices don't apply if you are sitting outside. That's a new one. Won't be back and will warn off others."}
{"text":"Tried Yelp for a new dining experience and discovered Ciao Grazie. The owner, Kevin, was training a new server and the service was seamless. Asked for a wine recommendation as I was unfamiliar with the Italian red choices and Kevin gave us a winner. Salads were very good as was the garlic bread. No spaghetti as they cook everything on a wood burning stove, but the eggplant parm and the manicotti were delicious. Again, Kevin made a dessert recommendation to die for. I'd recommend going there just for the Panacotti - \"Italian crime brûlée\". Absolutely wonderful. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you're going to have a pizza for dinner, get in the car and go here. Don't order delivery. Don't get Digiorno. Don't pick one up at Papa Murphy's. Go here. It's delicious, and the best pizza, by far, anywhere in this zip code. Aside from the great food, the service is exceptional. The owner, if you're lucky to catch him working, is the nicest guy on earth. If he recognizes you as a return customer he'll go out of his way to say hi and make sure you've had the best experience. This place is really, really, good."}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner w friends, lots of food. Great service from Heidi. Plan to return. Have not tried the pizza, but they look good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!! love this place, def a hidden secret in DC RANCH! Super excited about their new summer specials and wine events they are promoting too!! Tuesday Marg pizza and a bottle of wine 20 bucks?/ wow! Tuesday Funday for sure!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why all the good reviews about this place. We have been sitting at our table for more than half an hour and have no food. We had a difficult time getting waited on when we got here also. Not sure we will ever get fed. It is also really noisy. More of s bar atmosphere. Hope the food is worth the wait. Will not come back. Too many other good choices. This place is only for people who don't want to drive out of their neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you like quality pizza - Neapolitan-style - this is the place to go.  We had the Complimenti alla Mamma pizza which has mozzarella and ricotta cheese along with ham and sausage - I forget what else, but it's truly delicious.  The wine selection wasn't extensive, but was very nice.  Also, contrary to another review I saw on here, the service was wonderful.  We came in maybe 20 minutes before close and our waitress was incredibly helpful and considerate - super nice.  She checked up on us regularly - water, recommendations on wine, how we liked the food, etc. - and we never felt either rushed or forgotten.    Excellent."}
{"text":"I love the setting and the decorations of the restaurant. The pizza I ordered was OK but nothing to write home about. I did enjoy the bruschetta."}
{"text":"Great place off Pima not far from the 101. Bar has a TV that is great for watching a game right after work. Staff is friendly in that come on in and relax sort of a feel.  We come here often & year round and we love their PIZZA!!! Perfect thin crust! Typically we keep it simple with the Americana (pepperoni) and Toscana (mushroom & sausage). Traditional wood fired pizza never tasted so good!!  Also the Insalata Della Casa (house salad) is perfect to share. Order it with the 2 dressings mixed together, Balsamic Vinaigrette & Creamy Gorgonzola.   I am not big on long reviews...just love great pizza. Food is here, time to enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The five cheese pizza, scramoza appetizer and the manicotti are all amazing!!! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I bring my mom to Ciao Grazie for lunch every 2 weeks and we always get the Emiliana salad and margarita pizza.     The food is great!    But the service from Kevin is TOPS!  He really makes it an \"experience\" for us each and every time, which is what keeps us coming back over and over.    Love this neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. When the owner makes it a priority to spend time after your meal... Just to chat and talk Italian heritage, it shows they're more than just a restaurant. The time they put into each and every meal... All wood fired mind you, comes out in every bite. This place is a long haul for us, but rest assured, we'll make it a regular on our list. Some of the best wood fired pizza we've ever enjoyed. Gotta try the half pizza, half calzone. I dare you to try and not eat the entire thing!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago for the first time on a double date. We were all disappointed. I will start with some pros:  - great location  -chicken parm was good.  -Our waitress was great. So patient and very professional. The kitchen was so slow, but she kept her cool and was wonderful. Kudos to her - big time!   Cons - service was extremely slow. They were short staffed and I felt so bad for our waitress. She did the best she could. Our pizza was a huge letdown. I was expecting something like LAMP or LGO and I was so wrong. It was cold and flavorless. The only thing cooked and slightly warm was the dough - everything else was just raw on top of the pizza. No sauce, no melted cheese, meat wasn't cooked - just thrown on the top. So sad! Not what I expected at all. Maybe I misunderstood what kind of pizza I ordered? Were they in such a hurry to get food out of the kitchen that they just forgot to cook the pizza with the toppings?   Our friends got a salad and some spaghetti. They didn't care for their spaghetti and said the salad was just \"fine\". All in all - we were disappointed. Everything was just OK.  If you want Italian in N. Scottsdale, I would recommend LAMP, Spiga, NORTH, etc. I wanted this place to be somewhere we would come on the regular since it is fairly close to where we live, but we probably won't be back. Sorry - just not for us."}
{"text":"I happened to be working out across the street from grazie at the village and noticed a now open sign on the front of the building.  this is exiciting because there is nothing better than feeding your deprived body after a long workout.  I walked across the street to meet my buddy for some pizza and salad. Upon entering it was really loud and hard to hear. maybe because I am approaching the big 30 I am going deaf... maybe not?  anyhow the restaurant is laid back with a wine bar and multiple tables and unique lighting throughout.  I was approaced by the hostess and quickly seated around many families and kids playing on gameboys or portable dvds.  Our waitress Lauren came over wearing a nice scarf and was a sweetheart. we later learned she manages the grazie in verrado.  I asked her if she took a helicopter out there for work or just rode her bike.  we started out with the salad emiliana which consisted of arugula, baby greens, onions, red peppers, pine nuts and freshly grated parmesan cheese with a balsamic vinagrette.  This was tasty. lauren then brought us some fresh bread and olive oil with more cheese. good thing I am not lactose intolerant ladies :).  we then ordered the pizza toscana with sausage.  this was good.  the crust was a little burnt but tasty. the sausage was great and it was a thin crust deal.  The sauce was a little bland but we were starving and it was tasty.  you can never really have bad pizza.  Lauren then asked if we wanted desert.  unfortunately she was not on the dessert list... so we were forced to try the dolce della casa which was GREAT.... This consisted of a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and banana topped with vanilla ice cream.  This was insanely great and you have two sizes to choose from small and large. the small is plenty to share for 2.  Overall between the location, salad, desert and good waitress I will return soon."}
{"text":"I want to like CG but the pizza is so average in every way...crust, sauce and toppings.  Lots of better options out there.  Great location though."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service!  Loved the Chicken Parmesan and the chocolate calzone  Will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"I liked it.  The pizza crust was the best, I think I will try other toppings next go around.  I got the Toscana with pepperoni, and it was a bit much *for my taste*.  Caesar was good.  The kids pizza was huge for my son."}
{"text":"The atmosphere sets the stage perfectly, for this incredible Italian dinning experience!   If you enjoy sitting down with friends or family to relax over a glass of wine and not be rushed, this is a must try.  My wife and I have taken several friends, clients and family members to this location and everyone has enjoyed their chosen meal.  Whether they opted for the pizza, lasagna, eggplant, salads etc... Oh and I won't even try to explain the amazing deserts and cappuccino.  The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and attentive to the needs of their guest!"}
{"text":"Terrible We went this evening to have pizza at 8 Was met at the front door by two young women  I asked for table for two and was informed they were full for the evening  There were several open tables both inside and out  Never asked if we had a reservation  Very rude no explanation How can a pizza Place be full when there are open tables  We are a middle aged couple well dressed what a joke of a place  Never coming again"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night during busy Barrett Jackson - the restaurant was packed but we were given a table in a short amount of time - the service was friendly, fast and since it was our first time we asked a couple questions about the menu and our server was so helpful! We split the  Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza finished off with cappuccinos. A great cozy little place that will most certainly be a place we put on our must go to list!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising find. Great thin crust pizza where the ingredients, not a sauce, rule. Calzone was wonderful. All made on sight. Nice, quiet atmosphere (on a Monday night anyway). We would actually drive a ways to go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Ciao Grazie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.  We've driven by this restaurant any number of times to/from one of our favorite Phoenix-area hikes.  Most recently, we dropped in when our typical Italian/Pizza joint was packed as usual on a recent Saturday evening.  Our first impression was not good considering it wasn't at all busy.  Which in Scottsdale is very rare on a Saturday evening.  However, we found the food really well prepared and the bartender (Heidi) particularly attentive and helpful.  Its was also tastefully/colorfully decorated.  And I think fair to say they really appreciated our visit.  Our only complaint was that the prices were, in our opinion, a little high.  But feel this was a small price to pay (no pun intended) for the food, service and atmosphere.  We'll be back in the next few weeks.."}
{"text":"Small and simple is good... think of it as focused.  There's no stove, so everything is cooked in the pizza ovens, which makes for a succint menu.  The good news is it's all tasty and reasonably priced. It's not the finest food in town, but rather it's straight-forward food at fair prices, and everybody there is super-friendly. Great neighbordhood joint."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The best sausage ever.  Thin crispy crust.  I can't wait to try some other stuff here."}
{"text":"Alright, you get the point from all the other reviews that this joint can fire up a kick ass pizza so let me tell you about the best thing on the menu,... The Eggplant Parm! It's as good as you can get unless you head to Little Italy.  Glad this place is back on it's feet and hope it can continue to earn the business and great reviews. More importantly, I hope the Scottsdale elite wannabes will continue to take their misbehaving kids to that Romper Room pizza joint in DC Ranch and keep this pace brat free!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Great thin crust pizza. Nice pasta too.  Good wine selection. Great for outdoor sitting when weather is good."}
{"text":"People ask do they have Chicago style pizza or New York style pizza? The answer is they have Italian pizza and it is the best you will find any where around these parts. As a matter of fact everything about this place is very Italian. This is a class operation"}
{"text":"I love this place, been here several times for both happy hour and dinner.  This place has great happy hour!  It's fun to sit at the bar and Jeff is friendly and funny.  A couple of pizzas on the menu are half off and I had the Americana.  It was good...thin crusted and not greasy.  I could devour the whole pie. :) Beers was served in a chill glass and even though I am not a beer drinker, i enjoyed a beer there.  The Italian beer was light and smooth.   For dinner, i had Lasagna.  It was fantastic and covered with mozzarella cheese.   Emiliana salad was yummy!  Mmmmm...it makes me hungry thinking about the food.  They do have live music on Saturday with a musician playing guitar and singing.  Overall, everything was amazing!  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So I've been here three times already and all I can say is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! The owner and staff are delightful and hospitable as if they are hosting in their own home. I mean the service is awesome! I should know trust me, I have managed restaurants and they meet all expectations. The food is fresh, and prompt. I can't believe they make their own cheese and sauce! It helps that most of the staff are real Italians, and know their food! I've had the Piatto Misto, Americano Pizza, Carpaccio Bresaola Salad and their pepperoni gluten free pizza, all YUMMY! I found a new hangout spot! Yay!!!"}
{"text":"When you enjoy your faux-Napoletana pizza with cardboard-thin cracker crust and a faint drizzling of sauce, do you like to do so in a dining room with walls of plastic bricks and populated with boisterous children?  If so, you'll love Ciao Grazie.  We came here because we were going to be in the neighborhood anyways, and this place for some reason has mostly good reviews.  If only we knew the people who had eaten here are the same sorts who actually think Sauce makes a good pizza.  The meal started out OK.  The service was adequately warm, even if the over-the-top decor left it a little cold (it's OK for a restaurant to be unassuming - really, it is!).  The garlic bread was edible, even if it was just a piece of flatbread with butter and garlic salt on it.  Would have preferred actual garlic, though.  The pizza?  I went with the capricciosa, and my friend had the sofia.  When our tostadas... I mean pizzas... arrived, the unfortunate lack of substance in the crust was readily apparent.  The cornicione was almost nonexistent.  I have said it before, and hopefully I don't have to say it too many more times, but if you think the cracker crust is good, you're absolutely wrong.  There are certain propositions that are not open to different opinions, and this is one of them.  Furthermore, the toppings, besides the olives, were pretty lame.  The prosciutto on my friend's sofia was barely distinguishable from normal ham.  Ciao Grazie is all style and no substance, and the thin, lifeless crust serves as the perfect microcosm for the place itself.  If you like to eat that garbage, just go to Sauce, it's cheaper.  If you don't, do yourself a favor and go a few miles down the road to the far superior (and understandably more crowded) LAMP Pizzeria."}
{"text":"I ordered eggplant parmigiana and it was dry and overly salted.  My wife ordered a pizza and it was very good.  Unfortunately it was not a remarkable dining experience for what we spent.  Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood because I had to do a presentation. Unfamiliar with the area, I did a Google search for places to eat nearby and this restaurant appeared. I read the reviews and thought I'd try it for lunch. I parked in this open area and walked there. The place was clean and had the typical Scottsdale vibe. There is a patio outside and seating inside. The host/server was Anthony. He had about six tables total (indoors and outdoors). I didn't notice anyone else in the restaurant working besides him. He provided great service with a smile. Definitely, ask for him as your server. I ordered the Emiliana salad ($6). I thought it could use an additional drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette dressing and more pine nuts. Considering the price of pine nuts, I can say that I wasn't too surprised. I also ordered the Americana pizza ($9). The salad and the pizza were good. The crust was super thin with a good crunch on the edges. I thought the lunch special prices were a little pricey. But, what I expected to pay in Scottsdale. Excellent service, good food and a great milieu."}
{"text":"So far I have had the Napoli and the Roma.  Both very good pizzas; the Roma if you like anchovies.  Good football clubs as well.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in..."}
{"text":"Good pizza, bad service, and the place wasn't exactly packed.  No one came over to our table for what seemed like forever, and then finally the hostess came to take our drink orders.  We had to ask twice just to get some water.  From start to finish, the server was always very hard to track down when we needed something.  The ensalata de la casa was just fair.  Field greens, olives, and cucumbers basically.  Nothing exciting.  We only got it because it was one of the few that came in a \"large\" size.  The dressing wasn't bad...    We asked for some bread and they brought us some seriously hard ciabatta with no butter, no olive oil, nothing to put on it.  Even though I remember getting bread at the other location, we were told they don't normally serve it, so that's why they don't give you anything to put on it.  And it was way stale.  Supposedly they use it for the bruschetta, so make a mental note not to order the bruschetta.  The vegetariana pizza was delicious.  I'll give them that.  It has carmelized onions, which I love.  The margarita pizza was nothing special at all - just an orange-y colored pizza of cheese and sauce, like you'd get in a mall food court.  They do have a huge wine list with some reasonably priced bottles."}
{"text":"Great fresh salads with simple oil & balsamic dressings. Excellent wood fired pizzas & classy decor.  Enjoyed relaxing on south patio. Service was top notch. A perfect spot to recharge after a hike. Thank you for the quality eats!"}
{"text":"The topping of caramelized onions   on the salmon was a bad combination but the salmon was good once i scraped the onions off, the lasagne was kind of bland.  Sausage pizza was good but there was barely any sausage on it."}
{"text":"Happy hour all day Sunday . Make sure you see the happy hour menus . If you order the marigatta pizza it's not on the happy hour . It's the marigatta flat bread that's on it . So be careful,what you ask for."}
{"text":"Just delicious. In addition service was amazing! The pizza and the dessert were both great."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago.  Fabulous pizza (If you like authentic, wood fired, thin crust)!!!  Friendly service (ask for the sisters).  Combined modern and rustic upscale ambiance.   Family run?  Separate bar area to meet and chat before dinner, ample Italian wine list and Black Butte Porter (Bend, OR).  If you like thin crust pizza, these guys have it NAILED --- thin and bubbly, crispy without being cracker-like.  All fresh, flavorful ingredients."}
{"text":"Extremely tasteful Italian spot in north scottsdale that has a great wait staff and decor. There is a good sized patio if you want to sit outside.  Started off the dinner with a caprese salad and fresh ground pepper, fresh mozzarella is made daily in house. Don't forget the basil :)  Next course was the Margherita pizza. A thinner smaller pizza is a good way to describe the pie. Pizza can easily serve two, but if you're hungry you may want to order more. My only complaint was that the pizza was served cold and not straight out of the oven.    Last course was undoubtedly the winner, hands down. Apple \"pie\" (which is only seasonal and was told will be off menu soon). This was absolutely heavenly, served warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel. The pie dough was perfect and the size will be able to serve more than one!   I enjoyed meeting Marco, the owner from Italy with a lovely accent! He visited our table at the end of the night and was very interested to learn how our dining experience was. It was nice to see the owner helping out around the restaurant. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and salad to go last night. Food was ready before the pick up. The waitress and bartender were extremely nice and we enjoyed a short conversation. Restaurant seemed to be reasonably full however I really believe this to be a real gem and I hope that more local more North Scottsdale residence take the time to stay in. Two delicious pizzas and a salad for $30, very good deal."}
{"text":"Super nice restaurant, very affordable (we were surprised at how reasonable everything was, were expecting to pay a lot more).  We went there last night, I had the filet minon with garlic mashed potatoes & mushrooms, husband had manicotti, we all shared an amazing pepperoni pizza, LOVED the garlic bread appetizer, the kids LOVED their mac n cheese with fresh grated parmasean on top (my kids don't always like every restaurant's mac n).  Finished with sundae's for desert.  I had a lot of beer with a fresh icy glass each time (so reasonably priced and a nice touch!) --Everything was superb.  Service was on point, the place is absolutely gorgeous, pristine.  I love the area, we took family pics afterwards, there is a scenic fountain with mountains behind it, makes for awesome photography.  Wish I could post a photo, truly gorgeous!"}
{"text":"This place is legit thin crust heaven.  Came here for lunch last Saturday and loved everything from the service to the flavors of the pizza and salad.  Wines were also pretty affordable.  Has all the makings of being Scottsdale's next big pizza destination."}
{"text":"Great place!  Went on Monday night.  It was half off salads which is a nice special.  We got their Emiliana and Venetizana salads and both were good.  The house dressing is delicious!  We also had the brushetta assortment and it was good too.  The Super Tuscan red blend is very good.  Above all the service was fantastic.  Our waitress was super."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite close by restaurants services wonderful food is magnificent great take out as well"}
{"text":"Great thin/cracker crust pizza. My wife and I came down for a nice dinner on Sunday. We started with the garlic bread. Unlike a previous reviewer we like the simple garlic bread. I wife had the marina and I had the Tuscany. Both were good. I did find the sauce was a bit sharp. The crust was wonderfully thin with good marks on the bottom showing the best of the wood fired oven's heat. They have a long list of wines which looked very good. And I saw a desert go by that looked amazing which we will try next time we are here."}
{"text":"Great pizza - hot and tasty.  terrific wine list too.  very italian.  try the primitivo.  love it."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Somewhat disappointing after seeing so many 5 star reviews. Perhaps we went on an off day but with only a few people in the entire restaurant, I'm not sure why it would be so off. We started with the Insalata Veneziana and it was very good, although somewhat pricey at $12 for a large (meat would have been $4-5 extra).    The pizza was built up so much in the reviews that we decided to ask what the favorites were.  We decided on the Complimenti Alla Mamma which was highly recommended.  Unfortunately our order must have gotten mixed up and 45 min. later, we were still waiting for the pizza.  Finally, our waiter sees us with no pizza and checks the kitchen.  Not good when there's only a few people in the place. When we finally got the pizza, I was really disappointed.  The flavor was just meh.  I found it to be salty and the sauce was forgettable.  The texture was very nice at first, but by the 2nd piece the middle section was soggy.    I do have to compliment our waiter for apologizing for the mix up and he provided us a free dessert."}
{"text":"I went their with my bestie during their happy hour. The happy hour wine offerings were very good, and only $5. They also had a very good selection of wines. Kevin at the bar made a great recommendation of the Petite Syrah.  It was beautiful yesterday,  so we sat outside and enjoyed the sunset on the patio.  We had a delightful waitress Brigitte, who recommended the Insulate Veneziana. We both ordered it with chicken and it was outstanding. I wish I knew what is in their balsamic dressing, it was truly divine.  This restaurant has wonderful ambiance, food, staff, and wine. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing pizza and save room for the Chocolate Calzone! So happy to have great pizza in North Scottsdale! This former east cast gal has found her new Pizza Joint with a nice ambiance to boot. So glad this close to home spot re-opened with better pizza, better service and super happy hour!"}
{"text":"At last, a wood-fired pizza that makes sense of all things nonsensical.  Its crust, thinner than Kate Moss when she was in her heroin chic phase. Its toppings, imported from Parma and all places Italy. And the sauce, sneakily unobtrusive, not attracting attention to itself which is more than I can say for the typical Scottsdale posers who light here.  Throw in a hug and a kiss from a 1500 degree wood-fired oven and you've got a pizza fit for, well, me.  The servers are friendly and attentive. Their prices are fair, considering the location and quality of the food.  One drawback, the parking. There are less than a dozen parking spots outside the restaurant, which means you'll likely have to park across the street in The Village's parking lot. No biggie. There's no traffic to speak of so crossing the street means dick when that old soccer limp flares up.  If you're going to plan a visit, wait until fall when all the snowbirds flock to town. I rather enjoy having Grazie all to myself this time of year. If you do visit in summer, leave your little brats at home. I can get enough of that shit at Grimaldi's where all the DC Ranch shitheels parade their a-hole kids around like its a kiddie pageant."}
{"text":"The food was flavorful and delicious! The pizza was great and so was the bruschetta that we ordered. The service was great and we were seat quickly on a Saturday night! I plan on returning here time after time. I hope that everyone who reads this review tries this place!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic pizza. I was very happy they had a vegan option here however it is quite plain by itself so you have to add on more toppings which can get pricey. The crust is fresh and taste just how I want my thin crust to be. But unfortunately it was quite disappointing as cold pizza and reheated. It's one of those things you really need to experience at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly and cozy atmosphere. Great Italian wine list. You won't find a better pizza anywhere. But don't ignore their other dishes. The filet mignon and kabobs are outstanding. Perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. Want something lighter - try a delicious salad with salmon. And don't leave without trying Grandma's cannoli!"}
{"text":"The decor and location are great, the food and service not so much. The salmon bruschetta was way to salty, the garlic bread was plain and the lasagna was nothing special. First time here and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this quaint little Italian Pizzeria! The Alla Mama pizza is my favorite. The Salmon bruschetta is very yummy as well! Small beer selection & I would recommend adding Stella to it. Great wine selection & I love their big patio, you don't feel like you're on top of the table next to you. The owner is very friendly and greets all customers when he's there. This is one of my top 3 pizza places in the valley! Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For me there are two kinds of good pizzas--either truly Italian (Napoletana) like Pomo and Andreolis on Wednesday and Saturday evening or great Italo-American pizza like Johns of NYC.  This was neither.  This was like a bad version of Grimaldis (a 3 star pizzeria at best).  Oh what a disappointment!  I called the restaurant a few days ago and spoke Italian (I'm Italian from Lake Como) to whoever answered the phone.  I thought, \"great finally another wonderful pizzeria other than Pomo.\"  Wow, this just wasn't good at all.  The doe is that thin, almost cracker tasting doe.  The sauce was so salty, the cheese banal and the prosciutto was not what I ordered.  Not only was the pizza seriously disappointing, but no one was in the restaurant at 1pm.  I started with a pepsi that was all soda water and very little pepsi flavor.  The restaurant has a cute atmosphere--even though I was the only one there--but the pizza is a c minus.  Che peccato!"}
{"text":"Came here mid day..between lunch and dinner and it was super quiet.  We were the only ones in the place.  We ordered bruschetta and Prosecco.  My husband had a calzoni and I had a caprese salad.  Everything tasted fresh.  The staff was very friendly.  We will come back and try the pizza.    Love the location and there is plenty of parking nearby."}
{"text":"My friends and I love checking out Local restaurants midweek to break the monotony and drink a glass of wine and shoot the breeze.  Last night, on our way to Armitage, my friend swerved right suddenly and we found ourselves in Ciao Grazie. Franco, who is the owner, was super helpful and friendly and patiently helped us find the best wine to wind down on a Tuesday night. When we said we were vegetarians, Franco recommended the warm flatbread with fried mozzarella and delicious mushrooms. It was really really good. We also got a plate of Bruschetta. The Pesto on the bruschetta was fresh and bursting with flavor. The Al Fresco pizza was divine. We ended the meal with a memorable port and the most delectable, melt-in-the-mouth Tiramisu. While we did tease Franco about what on earth possessed him to leave a gorgeous place like Sardinia and live here in the desert, we feel so lucky he chose to! Ciao Grazie! But we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Just okay. First, I was craving pasta for lunch and they don't serve pasta so maybe that's why I'm dissatisfied.  When I asked the waiter/bartender for an alternative to mash potatoes he just stared at me until I said never mind. also, I waited a little longer for my food than I thought it should take. The chicken Parm was just okay...the suace was good but otherwise not that impressive, particularly for $18 with an $11 glass of wine for lunch.  In their defense, I think this place is more of a pizza joint and I was in the mood for pasta...which I did not get.  Grain of salt...but not a great experience."}
{"text":"I love it when a restaurant owner (Franco) is as involved in running a business as this place. His Italian accent made it even better. Even while being the only bartender, he was still attentive (I was sitting at a table in the bar area). The food was reasonably priced and quite good. I do wish the tomatoes on the Caprese were a little riper, but the huge slabs of mozzerella made up for it. The decor is cozy and inviting. I will be back."}
{"text":"First things first, this place is in the middle of no where. It is a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the area and heaven forbid it is dark, (which it was) then it makes it even harder to find because there hardly no lights leading up to this place. But once you find it.....   OMG!! I had the pleasure of going here recently with a friend of mine. Once we got there we were a little worried because the website said they closed at 10pm but the sign on the door said 9pm and it was a little after 8. Yikes. Especially since it was pretty empty. But no worries, they welcomed us with opened arms. It is quite different from the Grazie in old town Scottsdale. This one is bigger and more modern but the food is still amazing.   We ordered a bottle of the House Chianti, the Insalata della Casa with the creamy gorgonzola, Vegetariana and the Sofia. First things first, I was either really hungry or that salad was really good. I am going to say that the salad was really good. Perfect blend of cucumbers, red peppers and even olives (I don't even like olives and I ate some of those). Next came out our lovely pizzas. I have never seen so much prosciutto on one pizza in my life. OMG! It was perfect. I had the Vegetariana, which was still as amazing as the first time I had it but my friend ordered the Sofia and we were both like WOW that is alot of prosciutto. We were in pizza heaven. Needless to say we each ate our entire pizza and finished off the Chianti. I felt like a pig but our lovely waitress told me that she sometimes does the same thing so no worries. Considering that she was super tiny and gorgeous I took her word for it LOL.   So will I come back, HECK YES! I am not sure if I will visit this location again or the one in old town Scottsdale, but either way its a win win. The service was good, the pizza was good and the company was great."}
{"text":"Great choice in choosing a spot to open your 3rd location, Grazie!~ DC Ranch can totally use another pizza place on this side of town!  When Jared and I decided to go grab some dinner last weekend, we had no idea that Grazie would be so crowded - after all, this place just opened!  Well, word has gotten around, because it was a zoo!  We waited a few minutes for a table... and were both pleased to be seated inside shortly after.  The acoustics in the restaurant were not great.  We couldn't hear each other speaking let alone the music playing amongst all of the chatter.  Aside from that, we had a great meal...  I actually met Jared at the Old Town Scottsdale location of Grazie almost 2 years ago, so it kind of holds a special place in my heart.  It's a consistent, laid back, old standby for pizza, salad, wine, and that amazing 'dolce della casa' dessert of theirs.    During this visit, we mixed it up a little and went with an order of the eggplant parm or 'melanzane parmigiana' as they call it; in addition to sharing a large insalata della casa.  I hate to say it, but stick with the pizza... the eggplant breading stood out more than anything in the dish... don't get me wrong, it was good, but the pizza is probably a better choice.  Of course, even though I begged Jared not to order that dessert, he went for it... and sure enough, I have no will power, and I ate my fair share.  I have to say - it's frickin' good too!  Don't ever tell me the nutrition info; i don't want to know it.  The ingredients make me feel guilty enough; it's a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and banana and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Talk about a splurge!  And of course I took a huge bite just as I was tapped on the shoulder by a friend I hadn't seen in awhile - how embarrassing!  I think i was drooling chocolate at that point!  So, all in all - Grazie is great... I am sure I'll be back to this and the Old Town location.  I do have one suggestion other than the acoustics in this place.  Please add protein options as add-ons to the salads!  (IE: grilled chicken, shrimp, salmon, and turkey).  If you had these options, I'd go more often for lunch and not feel like I was completely splurging with every visit!  Lastly, if you go to Grazie, make sure to request Kaycee as your server - she's fabulous, and she's a fellow yelper!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local pizza place.  Super friendly staff and my daughter loves their pizza too! Always yummy!"}
{"text":"Went with my family for Happy Hour on 4/6. The staff was very friendly and the service was good. They have a nice variety of both food and drinks that are competitively priced."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with family and family friends. Maybe it was a Sunday night or a lot of people don't know about this place, but it seems a bit too empty for a cute and chic place! The prices are very reasonable and there's something on the menu for everyone such as pizzas, calzones, fish items, salads, pasta, etc.  I had the chicken parm and it was supposed to come with mashed potatoes but they said they weren't satisfied how they came out that day so they gave me Caesar salad instead. I appreciated their honesty. It was delicious, it was piping HOT! I really liked it. Parents had the sausage pizza and they really enjoyed it.  Most of our family friends got the salad and got salmon on it, they felt that for the price, they did not get that much salmon/protein on it so it was disappointing for them so hopefully that'll change soon! Otherwise it's all good and I wish them the best! Next time ill try the dessert! :)"}
{"text":"This place is very nice with exceptional staff and an efficient manager. Great drinks and I had my very first half pizza half calzone which is now my favorite.  Five stars all the way"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the middle of the McDowell Mountain Ranch neighborhood, this Pizza joint is a hidden gem.  We've driven by it dozens of times and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  It was a Sunday night and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant.  After browsing the menu, I spotted a unique item...it's called the Vesuvio.  It's a  1/2 Calzone,  1/2 Pizza concoction....I had to try it.  Additionally, it was happy hour, so Pizza was 1/2 price!  So we ordered:  Pepperoni Pizza, $14 (regular price, happy hour is 1/2 off) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=BLFokFO1e7C4iph6BcJU7Q#BLFokFO1e7C4iph6BcJU7Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=3hFzBESdIbdRZ8zZDx63tg#3hFzBESdIbdRZ8zZDx63tg  The Vesuvio (1/2 Calzone, 1/2 Pizza), $16 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=cxvJ6_KDrbbIG4YlrnFdBg#cxvJ6_KDrbbIG4YlrnFdBg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=00i0JtsGG9qUkCIeJTkx-A#00i0JtsGG9qUkCIeJTkx-A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=itgoHpgq-OCxgkoetT6GYA#itgoHpgq-OCxgkoetT6GYA  After a short wait, we  got our food and I was looking forward to diving into the Vesuvio, so that's what I tried first....I cut a piece of the Calzone and Pizza.  I tried the Calzone portion first....and it was bland....the Dough, Ricotta Cheese, and Ham were good and fresh, but it didn't have a much flavor....I think if there was some Sauce for dipping or if they had Sauce in the Calzone, it would be better.  The Pizza portion of the Vesuvio was awesome...it was a Mushroom/Cheese Pizza.  It had good flavor and was cooked perfectly.  After the 1st bite of the Calzone, I started to combine a piece of the Pizza and a piece of the Calzone together to make it taste good.  Perhaps that's how I should've been eating it from the start...?   The Pepperoni Pizza was awesome....full of flavor and the thin crust was cooked perfectly.    Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner here.  I'm glad we stopped by.  We'll definitely be back for Happy Hour.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this review as I feel that the employees tried so hard but the food was awful. We had a calzone which came out looking like it would be amazing but when we cut into it it deflated. The carpaccio was gross we misread the menu and thought it was real but instead it was cured beef. The margarita pizza was flavorless and even the wine was disappointing. We spent $130 on one of the worst meals ever. It's sad that a neighborhood restaurant in such a good location is so bad."}
{"text":"The service was WONDERFUL and the food was Delicious! I had the Chicken Parmesan Rosa, my husband had the Shrimp Alforno, and our four kids split a pepperoni pizza. Our plates were scraped clean. Then for dessert which I'm not a big fan of but this time I couldn't stop eating the chocolate banana calzone  It was intoxicating. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Was our first time here and had a great lunch.  We split the house salad (amazing salad dressing) and a vegetariana pizza.  Food was excellent and our server was awesome.  Loved this place and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place is slightly off the beaten path, but it's worth going to if you're in the area. Tasty Italian food in a hip setting. Try their delicious pizza or their slightly unconventional lasagne. The food tastes better right after leaving the gym (across the street)!"}
{"text":"I passed this place many times, but never thought to go there until my friend invited me for Tuesday ladies night.  This restaurant looks like get the traffic from people live in DC ranch & the surrounding area and of course the snowbirds.  They served mostly pizza and some salads as well as appetizers.  It was mellow night passed the happy hour by the time at 9:00pm the employees start cleaning up and ready to close the door.  I had Emiliana salad which is arugula, baby green, red peppers, pine nuts and shaved parmigiano reggiano in balsamic vinaigrette, it was good actually."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and great Italian wine list. We're all gluten free, which was the major draw. Our pizzas were ok. The crust was undercooked and gummy. My pizza was wet with sauce or the veggies weren't drained properly. Disappointing. If you're offering Italian style pizza and gluten free at that, it should be light and crispy, just like Italian crust."}
{"text":"So, I decided to give Grazie a try today for lunch with my sister. I've driven past it a million times and I figured \"What the heck?\" It was mediocre, and that is being generous. My sister and I weren't hungry, we split a \"large\" pizza. She got half cheese, I got half pepperoni. It was a 12 inch pizza. There was no bigger.  So, as we entered, our hostess ended up being our server and the bartender apparently. The place is understaffed due to not a large amount of people coming in for lunch. They need to figure out a way to promote it more. Might I suggest deals? NYPD is being quite successful with those.  Right before the pizza came, I decided to ask for bread after reading reviews on Yelp where a fellow Yelper said the bread was horrendous. Well, it was. As my sister puts it, \"My school's bread tastes like this.\" The pizza came shortly after, thank god.  I thought the pizza was decent. Was it the best I've had? Nope. Was it okay? Yep. Patsy Grimaldi's offers a much better pizza for the same price down the street (literally, it is at market street a mile and half away).   I plan on sticking to Grimaldi's and NYPD for my gourmet pizza. I was expecting something much better. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"If your looking for a warm, classy and overall friendly place to take your date or family...Ciao Grazie is it.  Franco, the owner provides exceptional customer service and remembers you whenever you return.  Great wine, appetizers, salads and the fire-grilled margherita pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been coming here every Saturday for the past month. The service is consistently good.  I love the house wine with the goat bruschetta for $10 during happy hour!  The oven is a true wood burning oven and I find that to yield a good European like thin crust pizza! I feel at home!"}
{"text":"Came here again today.. we had the americano pizza.. so so so freaking good! And get their tiramisu! Will be back over and over again.. love."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The pizzas are outstanding, and we are as picky as can be.  Don't go to Barros, don't pay too much at Grimaldi's - try this quiet spot between Windgate & DC Ranch.  I promise you will not be disappointed.    My 12 year old has forsaken ALL other pizzas, brushes his teeth, completes his typing exercises, and even does his homework without being nagged - all for the ability to have Ciao Grazie a couple of times a week.  Please support Ciao Grazie, as we have 6 more school-years ahead of us :)  -tom"}
{"text":"I really love this place! Grimaldi's used to be my go-to wood fire pizza place, but I think this place has replaced it! The bruschetta, salad and pizza were all great! The people that work there are also super nice. I'll be coming back many times!"}
{"text":"I found my new pizza stop while in Scottsdale. The pizza is fantastic and waiters make your dining experience FUN. You will go back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing gem!  A must go to!!  Great fish, pasta, salads and pizza!! The ingredients are all fresh and have just a wonderful artisan Italian flavor!  Great wine list with many Italian vintages!!! Eat at the bar, inside the restaurant, or out on the patio (that is a super place to watch a sunset!) Do not miss out!  Try it!  You will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow.... finally found a great wood fired restaurant in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  Been missing it from S CA and boy did we find a great one. They make everything in-house (mozzarella, sausage etc) and everything is cooked by fire except for panini sandwiches.  Attention to better quality ingredients and simple flavor combinations.  Happy to become a regular here.    Pictures: Crostini, mozzarella and prosciutto appetizers, Cesar salad,  Pizzas: Dame Edna and Sofia"}
{"text":"We love their pizzas, especially the \"Vegetariana\" one..  Great for take-out and eating in too."}
{"text":"I like Grazie. The pizza is good and the atmosphere is cozy. I do wish they had a few more pasta dishes though. All they have is the lasanga."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a few times while wintering in Scottsdale. Love the atmosphere with spread out tables and the patio is really nice. Tried four different pizzas and were not disappointed. Great wine list and the staff are friendly. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Come here with friends for every special occasion - the pizza, wine and dessert is DELISH.  I love the atmosphere here and the patio is the place to be on a cool winter night.  This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town (aside from Cowboy Ciao!)"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant there is in town. Food is Italian original;  service is professional and consistent. All friends and people I invite are blown away with this place every time I take them there. We love Ciao Gratzie. I also buy gift cards for friends to celebrate  their especial occasions and everyone really loves it. I highly recommend Ciao Grazie."}
{"text":"Great place!  Tables are spread out nicely for privacy, patio dining is nice and cozy.  The Emilina salad with filet is my favorite thing of the menu!  I get it every time.  The filet is highest quality.  They offer gluten free pizza.  Beautiful neighborhood.  Great for kids and or a dinner date."}
{"text":"I went here with a work girlfriend for happy hour yesterday, and we loved it!  They have great food and drink offerings, with great specially prices, too.  The owner, Franco, took great care of us during our visit, and is obviously passionate about providing delicious food to his customers.  My friend and I started by sharing the Piatto Misto, which featured three different meats, some aged asiago cheese, seasoned kalamata olives, and crispy bread sticks.  Yum!!  We followed that up with the Margherita Flatbread, which Franco suggested we garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Delizioso!!  My friend's husband showed up later in our visit and ordered the Italian Chicken Quesadilla, which he seemed to really enjoy - I couldn't help but notice the generous portion of chicken that was included.  It looked delicious as well.  Franco was very prompt, accommodating, and personable.  We will definitely be back!  I can't wait until it's cooler so we can enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"The owner followed-up with my about my experience, which I do appreciate. Not sure if I will come back but to take the time to respond to negative reviews is something worth noting."}
{"text":"I've come to appreciate Grazie. I had been to the one in Old Town 3 or 4 times a few years ago, and always thought it was okay. Maybe Grazie has improved over the past two years or maybe my palatte has changed, or maybe I was just really hungry. Either way, we had a great dinner there over the weekend! My boyfriend told me that I was  in charge of the ordering that night.... Pressure!!   My order:  Their bread was very good, perfect to go along with the salad we started with.  The waitress brought us a couple of wines to try. I went with the Nebbiolo - nice wine  Emiliana salad: Arugula, mixed greens, red onions, red bell peppers, shaved parmesan. Good mix. I've always thought that Grazie is a little heavy handed with the oil and too light on the balsamic on their salads. Still slightly true. A dash of salt and pepper perfected the salad for me.   Vegetariana Pizza:  (a waitress suggested to add red sauce, which we did and it was a great choice!). YUM! The carmelized onions and sweet peppers were delicious. Very good crust too. My highly carniverous boyfriend commented that he didn't even miss not having meat.   The Grand Finale... Dolce della Casa. This is a calzone stuffed with nutella (we thought probably almost an entire jar) and bananas then topped with vanilla icecream. We ordered the small to share - I can't even fathom the large size. It was delicious! Very rich, so neither of us could finish.   Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We enjoyed the perfect weather on the patio. A little traffic noise - I'd prefer the patio not facing Thompson Peak Pkwy. Definitely going back to Grazie!"}
{"text":"I went to go pick up my boyfriend from work to have luncg. he suggested this place...  Oh my word. This place was in the middle of nowhere.  Very low key, nice decor, probably four people was dining in. We got seated right away. . The waitress was so hard to a comprehend. We ordered the Caesar salad first. It was really good. Then we ordered the el forno pizza and the Tuscana pizza.. Not deep dish. Regular.. It took 25 minutes for the pizza to come out.  Everything was good with the tuscana pizza. But the el forno, it was delicious! But they put way too much vinaigrette.. :(  Overall, the service was great. The food was decent  .. kinda pricy. ..  I'll go back, but not for the el forno pizza."}
{"text":"Grazie's cheese pizza is my all time favorite. I love it because it is delicious and doesn't overwhelm you with tons of sauce. The Thompson Peak location is super cute and nestled in the mountains with a great atmosphere and patio. I love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Pizza is to die for! Don't miss the cheesecake dessert!  You will never be disappointed with the pizza. Nice bar with Tvs to watch sports."}
{"text":"We went here this past Saturday night. We split a caprese salad and it was fine for two people. Everything was fresh and good. We ordered a Margherita wood fired pizza with sausage and thought it was good. We do like thin crust pizza and knew what to expect. We finished with fresh brewed coffee and Tiramisu. Both were very good. Our waitress was very attentive and the bar tender even took the time to walk over two beers. They have inside and outside seating. We will go back again and try something different on their menu."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here! Wonderful service and even better food! We live in the neighborhood and have always wanted to try this place and we were so happy we finally did! The manager came to our table and was so friendly! He bought us dessert for our anniversary, and it was to die for! A dessert calzone, Nutella, banana and a sugary crust! Heaven! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On February 16th, we had our wedding reception on the south patio at Ciao Grazie.  The food was fresh, plentiful and very, very delicious.  We're still talking about the lasagna!  The setting was lovely.  Most importantly, the service was amazing.  We didn't want for anything.  Cosmo and his staff went out of their way to ensure a perfect evening.  We have been to Ciao Grazie a number of times, and the food & service have always been great.  The view of the sun setting on the McDowell Mountains while sipping wine on the patio is not to be missed!  This place is one of Northeast Scottsdale's hidden gems."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Caio Grazie, especially the authentic thin crust pizza. The friendly service, food, and ambience keep us coming back weekly. The salads are so fresh! Can't say enough about this place. Consistently excellent!"}
{"text":"U gotta love this place for happy hour Best deal in town; great menu, fresh food, really nice service - now how could u beat that?  Whether it's the bruschetta salmon or the insalata veneziana or the apple calzone with ice cream and butterscotch sauce - it's all memorable! Can't wait to return to try more"}
{"text":"My first experience at Ciao Grazie was less than superb, but I'm happy to report that management has made things right. It's not common for a restaurant manager to take ownership of guest experience at such levels, but Ciao Grazie was an exception. We were invited back for lunch and out 2nd experience was much better.   I ordered the Al Fresco, a co-worker ordered the Margherita, both were superb. We were also presented with oils to have with the pizza and those were great as well.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The good stuff: lovely decor and very friendly service. The bad stuff: we waited for AN HOUR for our food (3 pizzas). Our gluten-free pizza was majorly undercooked. We ate it anyway because we were starving. (Our sweet server took it off the bill.) I don't think we'll return - way too many better options out there!"}
{"text":"Quiet early on a Sunday evening. Bruchette Pomodoro was fresh with lots of basil, just like I like it.  Lentil soup was a very generous portion and delicious. Alle mama pizza came hot and yummy with dollops of ricotta to add a creamy top on the crunchy thin crust. Great end to a fun day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza but still has a little chew. Highly recommended!!  Very friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"amazing food pizza was great yes thin however had great texture and taste they use wood.fired.oven owner is from Italy better then some of the places I have had in vegas. sauce is light and airy taste the dough fresh made.also split a salad can't remember name but it had red wine in it? That was the groups favorite salad.overall about 60 bucks.for 2.salads a pizza split and salmon brucheta. There evening hours are.light trade.so in a rush best time happy hour wine bar esk."}
