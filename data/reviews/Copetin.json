{"text":"It was a lovely experience coming for Copetin's soft open. Their menu is an eclectic collection of tastes with a flavour for every palate. The wait and bar staff was extremely attentive and social. Everyone was knowledgeable of the ingredients and pairings within the dishes. A great addition to the Old Toronto neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Compare to most of downtown resturants, Copetin have very spacious seating. Creative menu, beautiful plate decoration & tasty food. Very friendly service, Cocktails are good but still have room to improve . Price reasonable, recommended !"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 3.5, will go with 4. Food is fine, a bit pricey by comparison to most places in area. $22 for a hamburger with fries. Mediocre beer selection, much like a corporate restaurant. Cocktails average $15. Staff was attentive and professional, patio is great. 3 different menus depending on where you sit... Odd"}
{"text":"The food was better than it sounded on the menu. When we first saw the menu, we were not super excited as the descriptions were a bit boring. However, the food was very tasty and well presented. I would recommend the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0  Copetin is the latest restaurant venture opened up by celebrity chef Claudio Aprile whom you may recognize as one of the judges on Masterchef Canada as well as for his previous restaurants like Origin and Colborne Lane.  This restaurant features a main dining area with a central open kitchen concept as well as a bar and outside patio - all of which have their own separate menu offerings.  At first glance, the main dining menu generally focused on Canadian cuisine but it also incorporated diverse cooking methods and ingredients from various ethnic foods.  A great example here would be the tea smoked squab dish which uses a traditional cooking method found in some Asian cuisines. In terms of the dish, the meat itself was well prepared, juicy and tender. However, we thought the price of this dish was quite steep for what it is and not really fitting as an entree due to its minuscule portion wise - it's a 3.5* for me.  I would say this entree is still one of their better dishes as we also tried the lamb which was quite underwhelming and would definitely not recommended - it's a 2.5* for me.  The service was friendly and you can tell that they have been properly trained to provide a more elevated experience but the main entrees came out 20-25 mins after we had finished our appetizers which is longer than expected. Overall, we were expecting top notch food and kitchen service at their price point but that was not the case unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the creations by Chef Claudio Aprile for a long time and Copetin is evolving with Claudio in a great way. Starting with the front of the house experience, we were seated right away and our server, Diana, was extremely friendly and walked us through the menu.  My companion and I were sharing all the dishes and we created our own tasting menu. After each course our plates and silverware were replaced. Great service.   The food....  I have been eating Claudio's beet salad for a long time and I don't even like beets. This latest evolution is amazing. Other dishes that we tried included the crispy squid (we actually saw some of the chefs preparing fresh squid for dinner....fresh). Some surprising flavors because not all the components are listed on the menu but was later explained by our server.    Following this we had the chorizo, Bimbambop which features amazing kimchi and a tea smoked egg).   Great experience and great service and great food."}
{"text":"This is my sexy neighbourhood spot and it is addictive.  Great outdoor patio with very nice wine list and great tapas.  Delicious cocktails.  Great servers.  Duck tacos and lamb keftas are flavourful and addictive.  The octopus is pretty but tough so don't get it.  The gnudi is carb heaven.  Great with a luscious red wine.  Highly recommend this spot for a drink date.  So happy it is here close to me and that I can go any time I want:)"}
{"text":"Our Wagyu was quite obviously  overcooked and without concern after we mentioned it. The dishes are visually appealing but there is too much going on, less is more."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant because of the hype and the fact that the chef was featured on master chef Canada. I think my expectations were too high. My husband and I went for a belated Valentine's Day dinner but it wasn't very romantic. The quality of the food was good but very pricey. The only good part of the night was the service. Not worth the high prices in my opinion."}
{"text":"Saturday night, bar 1 of 3 was Copetin.  This Spanish inspired bar is serving up some traditional and eclectic food and drinks.   In terms of ambiance, its quite the place, beautiful bar, with hints of contemporary and chic bohemian decor here and there its got a cozy, chilled out and romantic feel.   They do have a great menu, however do be advised though I found their dishes creative/ innovative it was a bit on the expensive side.  Service was okay, but tough to get attention even though the place was quiet to begin with.  After a glass of Rioja we were on our way to the next place.  Would I come back, they do have free tapas during happy hour, but do call in to find out more details.  Though this is not a traditional tapas bar I still find it hard to comprehend how people spend an arm and leg for tapas.  I guess Tapas bars in Spain could teach Canadian tapas bars a few tricks."}
{"text":"That celebrity chef, Claudio, unbelievable in comparison to what we view on television. I had to get up and leave with my sons seeing the behaviour he displayed by the patio bar. Yelling at his employees in front of customers. The food is nothing to brag about. All it is, is the hype people make of it and his celebrity friends who've given his restaurant the 5 star reviews. You're not missing out. Go elsehwere and enjoy your meal without unprofessional employer distractions and harsh working conditions from what I witnessed. I wouldn't tolerate that for a second!"}
{"text":"Don't pass up the opportunity. Stop in for a drink and I promise you will stay for awhile. Comfortable environment that will draw you in to experience the best of your senses."}
{"text":"I don't understand Yelp's rating of $$. My friend and I thought it was very expensive. Ended up paying $15+ taxes for 4 small slices of bread with 3 cherry tomatoes and a little bit of mozzarella. The bar itself is very nice with a dim might and is cool for a quiet drink, but it was way more expensove than what we expected and there are very few vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The food was quite good.  The service was excellent.  I do not expect gargantuan portions but these portions were ridiculous. The brussell sprout salad was delicious but so small that I carefully measured my bite size to make it last.  Seriously, would it cut into profitability to add a little more, especially considering the price.  The same with  the pasta.  Quite tasty but ridiculously small. Why give any food at all?   What really got me was the prices of wines. Absolutely ridiculous.  I would not go back to this restaurant out of priniciple and I will certainly warn my friends. I always order wine at decent restaurants but this was the first restaurant where I have ever abstained because of the prices ( and the 5oz scam)T The wines are offered in a 5oz glass or a 9 oz glass. Most restaurants offer a 6oz and a 9oz glass. 6oz is too small. 5oz. is just stupid. Maybe they are hoping you don't notice.  The price for a 5oz. was approximately $12, which  is really $15 with tax and tip. I think the cheapest wine in a 9 oz glass was about $20, or $26 including tax and tip.   I was just in London England, a city that everyone thinks is very expensive. Real estate and hotels, yes.  Restaurants there offer significantly better value.  Proper portions, not a portion that makes you feel like the restaurant is doing you a favour giving you any food at all. When you ask for a glass of wine, they pour a proper glass of wine, not a small pittance, and they wouldn't dare charge the prices that restaurants in Toronto charge.  What does please me is that many of my friends, many who are reasonably well off, are starting to get angry at the prices here. It won't be long before restaurants will suffer.  If this restaurant offered significantly better value and proper portions , I'd be back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a little after work drink (have to mention about the Sour Saint cocktail here, it's ssssooo good). Foods are all served as snacks, so don't be afraid to order some more. All dishes are really culturally diverse. I love how the Asian elements are integrated with western styles."}
{"text":"Located in the SE corner of King Street East and Church Street, MasterChef Aprile's newest multi-concept venture, Copetin Restaurant & Bar, replaced what used the former home of Origin.  My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary a few days ago, and we had a wonderful evening :) I've always been a fan of Chef Aprile since Colborne Lane, known for the molecularly inclined creations, so I came in with higher than normal expectation.  I love how the Copetin kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant, you can see Chef Aprile and team working away during dinner service. There is also a Chef's Counter, which will seat 6 guests a night with a completely different dining experience. On the other side of the dining area is a gorgeously lit lounge bar with a separate menu, and a Botanist Bar in the patio that specializes in tapas and cocktails made with Botanist Gin x fresh in-house garden-grown herbs.  To kick start our celebration, Copetin kindly offered us some welcome champagne, and a beautifully presented Lobster seviche (thank you!). We ordered Charcoal-grilled octopus and Beef Tartare for appetizers to share. Both dishes were nicely plated, and the flavours and textures were new and exciting, and of course, very delicious!  For the main course, we shared the Ricotta Gnudi (so good!) - it was light, fluffy and creamy. Husband had the Wagyu striploin - it was excellent; the ingredients paired so well together! I had the Lamb loin - it was overcooked to a medium well, but I really appreciate that they offered to redo it again. The second time around was definitely better, but could be much better.  I had a chance to try all 3 desserts on their current menu! The Rosehip Bavour - a light blueberry dessert - is a must order! I loved the presentation with the dry ice - instant wow factor :) It was a very nice dessert to end our evening.  The Caramelized Tres Leche Cake, on the otherhand, was on the heavier side - the caramelized banana was heavenly. I also sampled the Citrus Moon (My friend was celebrating his birthday at another table and offered me a piece, thank you!) - it was a very nice surprise lol. It was citrusy and refreshing but not my favourite one of the 3... I'm not a big fan of citrusy stuff (sorry!).  Overall, very enjoyable experience! Our waitress was very friendly and gave great recommendations. Thank you for making our night extra special :) Keep up the great work, Team Copetin! I'll definitely be back for the Chef's Counter another time ^^"}
{"text":"We've been here several times since it opened and we've never been disappointed!!  Everything we've eaten has been amazingly prepared, creative and very delicious.  This is my favourite place for cocktails in the area! You have to try the Sour Saint or the Cold Tea!!!    The atmosphere is great, the staff is incredibly professional and friendly. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for lunch since the patio is absolutely gorgeous.  What use to be Origins is now Copetin, chef Claudio Aprile's latest restaurant (from Master Chef).  The lunch menu is very selective, opted for a corn diet and loved both my hockey's: Corn on the Cob (with Mexican spices and a creme fraiche) this was really really messy and Corn Ice Cream with Carmelized Popcorn . Not the traditional lunch choices but I really did not want a salad... which was the only gluten free choice unfortunately.  I loved the corn ice cream a little bit to too much   My friend had the chicken Parmesan sandwich and he was very disappointed.  Chef, I think you need to take this up a notch for the lunch time crowd... I think we will be going back to Chef Michaels restaurant just down the street."}
{"text":"Expensive...but in all truth...worth it.   Service is great. We went for appetizers.   Beef tartare...7/10 Octopus...9/10 Beet salad: 8/10 Soup:9.5/10"}
{"text":"We came in expecting this place to be pricey. And it was. However! The quality of the food the drinks were amazing. They did not cheap out on the ingredients that went into what they put on the (small) menu. It wasnt very busy when we went. Mind you it was Saturday at dinner time. The server was very nice. Explained our orders pretty well... I think. Lol lets face it. I dont know what half the terminology was.  So... Would I go back? Probably not. Nothing against this place but it was pricey. And these are dishes I probably wouldn't crave during the hormonal times of the month. However it is worth the visit. Their cocktails were delicious. And I would recommend them to anyone."}
