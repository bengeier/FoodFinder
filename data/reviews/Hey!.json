{"text":"Had an uncomfortable dinner their as their cooling system wasn't working...felt like I was eating in a sauna.  Service was good.  

Food was okay but overpriced.  $18 for two pieces of fried chicken?  Wife had beef stew which was okay (also small portion) but again overpriced.

Won't be heading back unless I hear of price changes."}
{"text":"Thought I would give him another try....what a mistake! I made a really poor decision and brought my parents here on Thursday Night.....it has actually gotten worse! Although the place was basically empty it took over an hour to get our food which was completely F****** up....every item was wrong....this is unreal.....DO NOT GO HERE!
will not return"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very attractive, nicely done. Service was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately disappointed with the food. The tourtiere was Overcooked, dry and the pastry was actually burnt in places. This happened to me and another customer who was sitting beside me about 45 minutes apart today at lunch. I didn't want to cause a scene and was starving so i ate instead of complaining. However it should have never been sent to the table the way it was. Hope they can improve on their food as it's a lovely restaurant and welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"Liked it. Went there last night and were seated straight away. Granted it was a little on the later side of the evening but the staff greeted  us with friendly smiles and words.
Our food was really tasty (fried chicken and the burger and the beet salad). I believe that the chicken must be brined because it was very moist.
We will go back. Loved the layout of the place. It was cozy and comfy for such a windy chilly night in Toronto."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Hey for a birthday celebration this week. We were warmly greeted and found the server helpful and friendly. We were seated just above the kitchen and thoroughly enjoyed watching the chef. 
When we left we were told that they were still working on the menu and we certainly had some thoughts on the food. 
I ordered the falafel and since it was listed under\"mains\"I thought it would be more that 3 small balls in a sauce with some parsley on top. It was tasty but certainly not a \"main\" 
My sister had calzone and although it was tasty it was quite dry without some sauce or salad. For dessert we had bread pudding but again it needed something to complement the denseness.
We enjoyed the ambiance but left with some disappointment and I certainly left hungry"}
{"text":"So there's this time we went to Hey, and we had 6 adults and a baby and a 4 year old. We travel as a pack see? 
So it's been a long day, and it was hot, so we got Sangria (which is juicy, fruity & made with love!) and I decide it would be fun to play a game of pretend lollipop with the 4 year old (who is one of my favourite little people) and the baby needs to eat so his mama is breastfeeding him at the table, lots of laughs, everyone catching up on their day, when the 4 year old grabs the invisible lollipop back from me and in turn, pulls the entire pitcher of cold, delicious Sangria, onto the quiet and peaceful breastfeeding baby and mama.
Well, you can imagine a really cute baby drenched with delicious Sangria, which of course is preferable to the reality of a 2 second stunned silence, followed by a squelching wail of a child interrupted. The baby, so mad because he is now so cold, and not nearly old enough to drink the Sangria, screams his little red wine covered head off, and we all scramble to clean up mama, who took most of the pitcher to the crotch.
Long story short, staff was amazing! Re-seated, new pitcher of Sangria, baby and I took a walk down Roncy ringing everyone's bells on their parked bikes (hot tip to all the aunties out there, works like a charm) until he was at peace with smelling like the delcious baby covered in fruit and red wine that he was.
I had the Rodfather (meatball sammo) which was just as delicious as I wanted it to be, with a side of rapini, more Sangria & something chocolately for dessert. The staff really saved our bacon, and we had such a lovely night (and the baby smelled good too)"}
{"text":"Hmmm....well I need to update because I've been there several times now and my first visit was definitely the best.  They've been hit and miss ever since.  I feel horrible because I really want to love this place but it's not living up to the potential I saw during the first visit.  I'd give it 2.5 to 3 stars now.

The service has been up and down.  I called it distracted in my first review...it became non-existent and now is much better so overall it's definitely improved.

The food, not so much.  The wait times can be insane even when it's slow and meals often don't arrive at the same time.  I was there last week with three people and two of us received our dinners a good 15 minutes before the other two.  More attention needs to be paid to the sides as well.  The main part of the dish is consistently good but whatever it comes with (let's say the veg for example) seems to be an afterthought if it's a thought at all.  

Rod has come over to apologize to us on a couple of visits and has given us cookies on the house as we were leaving so he's definitely aware of the problems and trying to fix them.  I'm still hopeful but not as enthused as I was the first time out."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Hey last night and we weren't impressed with the service or the menu.  For starters, two of us ordered the kale caesar and were pretty excited to see it on the menu, garnished with a bean and slice of lemon.  It came with neither.  When we asked the server to bring the garnishes (it needed the lemon) she seemed perturbed, anyway, they didn't have lemons (despite multiple fruit shops nearby).  The menu was also disappointing.  For such a well-equipped kitchen there was a pot-pie, a stew, and a cottage pie among only a few other items.  These are too similar; simply not enough choice.  The appetizers were tasty, but our mains were only decent - nothing to write home about.   Also, this is definitely not an Italian restaurant as it was listed.  Sure, there was one pasta on the menu, but the rest of it was more Irish or even English.  Overall, none of us would recommend it.   Hey, please introduce new items to the menu and train your staff!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal!! The burger was unreal and the ketchup was so tasty, can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick beer and meal before work.  Showed up at 4:45 and were told that dinner menu doesn't start until 5 but they could offer us a calzone.  We were starving so we agreed.  Ordered a beer and calzone...sat for about 30 minutes until someone asked us if we ordered.  We were told there was an issue with the computer and they didn't get the order.  Since it was after 5pm we asked for the menu.  Ordered and received our meal within 15 minutes.  The meal was great but over priced. After we finished our meal we were then told we had to move because they had a party coming in.  They offered us a dessert on the house for the trouble.  Not only did no dessert arrive but after we finished our beers, we were sitting for 20 minutes waiting.  We finally walked up to the server with our coats on and asked for the bill.  What we thought was going to be an hour turned into 2 hours and a $30 parking ticket since we didn't intend our outing to be so long.  Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Hey! closed for a few days (over a week?) a few months ago and changed a few things. It no longer has table service, and has essentially lost its bar in the process since it is now where you line up and order food.

They need a much more serious make over. Get rid of both bars and put some tables on the ground level - people want to see their happy neighbors eating through the window. Re-instate table service which professional wait staff, and season the food!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times now and my experience has gotten better at each visit. It certainly feels like they have most of the kinks ironed out. The food is great and I love the fact that it's all local and sustainable.
Some find it expensive, but it's still cheaper (and better) than other nearby restaurants that serves a lower quality food (I'm looking at you Mitzi's).
My only issue remains the service. Am I supposed to pay at the bar or my table? This remains a mystery...
They are open on new year's day which is when I plan on getting my answer. Until next time!"}
{"text":"what have you done to my \"i'm too lazy to cook, let's walk a block to hey! and get good service and interesting food at reasonable prices\" place. when hey first opened, the menu changed frequently, which was cool, i like trying new stuff. then it started changing less. then the daily specials were constantly sold out by 8pm. service and food was always good though, so we kept going on a quasi weekly basis. now the format has changed. you don't get seated, you have to order and pay at the counter, seat yourself, when your name is called, you come get your food and take it to your table. this would be acceptable if the prices had not remained the same. being in the service industry myself, i can vouch for the fact that you cannot offer less service at the same price and expect people to like it. i was not impressed. reading the rest of the reviews, awesome service was mentioned in most of them. too bad hey! has gotten rid of their top offering, service. if i wanted to serve myself, i would stay home."}
{"text":"We maybe shouldn't have gone when Hey! was quite so new.  We were there on September 29th, and I think they were still ironing out some pretty significant wrinkles.  

I think the menu is ever-changing, but on this particular day, I had a spaghetti with meat sauce, which I quite enjoyed.  My husband however, ordered a pizza, and it was TEENSY TINY.  It was maybe 8\" in diameter, and while he did love the taste, it wasn't really a practical serving size.  Luckily, he had ordered a soup as a starter - however that was served just barely warm.   We watched the table beside us order it later in the evening, and saw that it was delivered steaming hot.  So perhaps we should have spoken up.   However, it was rare that a server visited our table.  We felt like we were often forgotten about.

My husband wanted red wine with his pizza, but we were told they didn't yet have red wine (they hadn't received the shipment).  They had rosé, but that wasn't going to cut it.  We couldn't help but wonder why they wouldn't have just bought a few cases at the local LCBO?   I don't understand how restaurant liquor licences work, but there must have been an option?  

We then ordered dessert (some sort of cake, I can't remember now what it was), and I, being pregnant, thought a decaf latte might have been nice with it.  But, we were told the decaf coffee hadn't come in yet.  Again.... wondering why they couldn't improvise by running up to Starbucks and buying a few pounds of decaf?  

The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable, with a real \"at home\" feel to it.  Lots of kids, very family-friendly.  But the service is a definite area for improvement.  Food seems to be hit and miss so far.   And our receipt was hand-written.  So like I said, maybe we just went to early.

I want to like this place!  I love to see great success on Roncesvalles.   C'mon Rodney Bowers, show us what you're made of!"}
{"text":"love this place! i don't even live in roncy but my husband and i come to roncy just to eat and work at this place. plus good beers on tap! plus the decor is awesome."}
{"text":"Just when you thought it couldn't get worse it does...

Reminiscent of the ikea food court,patrons are expected to order from a skimpy list of lacklustre offerings (no desserts anymore folks) and are left to seat themselves, where ever...no need for table numbers, when your food is ready the same bored counter staff you just dealt w moments ago bellows out your name for pickup. Note, your table will not be getting their meals together, it's a slapdash affair over here.

Seating is now limited to the upper level so while they tout 'kid friendly' you better leave that stroller behind.

From the street this place looks like it's closed for business and the front is now painted a sombre flat black, blinds drawn. If I hadn't have called ahead to confirm they were open evenings I would have assumed otherwise...I wonder if they are slightly ashamed of the food court format and in hiding?

I'm guessing there are no tips to be made here as patrons are expected to clear their own tables, 15 min in I'm still sitting next to an uncleared table. This lack of service and attention does make one hell of a place to squat for hour w/o ordering a damn thing. Wonder if they have free wifi?!

Unless you are desperate skip this joint n keep heading north. 

oh did I mention they no longer serve the nice teas they used to (only herbal tea on offer now is a bag of mint or chamomile mint), no more lattes or capps either...and zippo to a decaf as well.  ug."}
{"text":"Just had a super family friendly (they have a kiddie nook complete with toys and books) early evening meal with friends here. 

The vegan meatballs (lentils, mushrooms, sweet potato etc) are wonderful and the salads are fresh. My friends were also very happy with their meals and its easy to eat here if you are staying away from carbs.

Service is friendly and it's one of the most homey experiences I've had dining out with my toddler... I'm going back soon!"}
{"text":"Been for a few brunches and always enjoyed it...but last night I had dinner and it was without question one of the top 3 meals I've had in Toronto. Part of that was due to the food that was prepared and part due to the fun atmosphere provided by Chef Rodney Bowers and his staff. He recommended the beef tenderloin (from a cow living up in Uxbridge) and it was the best steak anyone at the table had eaten in memory. It was served on some mashed potatoes and root vegetables. It was perfect.

Also tried the gnocchi and beet risotto which had forced everyone to share each plates. 

Wednesdays are cheap whiskey ($3.75) and wings. So mark your calendars. I'll see you there. Also: Music selections included Third Eye Blind, Jimmy Buffet, and LMFAO. Hey now!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Was very pretentious before. They closed and remodeled to become hey meatball. Still pretentious staff and food. Meatballs are very dry. Only worthwhile thing on the menu was a chicken blt sandwich that they no longer have. Also $20 for a sandwich and side salad is ridiculous. Go to The Dizzy instead"}
{"text":"A fairly underwhelming dining experience. 

The decor is bright and airy with a hint of country chic. The menu items however, are fairly uninspired. The food taste and quality was average. 

We were seated in a comfy back nook that was filled with cushions. While this was good in principle, it meant we were invisible to our wait staff. Our server kept changing for each portion of the meal. They forgot to bring one of our dishes, and I had to leave the table and find the server to remind them. The server was generally disinterested in our 'OK' food.

All in all, a pretty mediocre experience due to poor service and average food. Likely won't return."}
{"text":"Staff: My sister and I came here with my 2 year old nephew for dinner a few Thursdays ago. As we came in the door my nephew tripped and hit his head on a bar stool. Within 10 seconds one of the servers was there asking if he could help. Another server brought my nephew a snow globe, and even one of the owners came to check and make sure we were being taken care of.  This restaurant has an AMAZING staff! Throughout the night we had at least three servers bringing us food, clearing space for our new dishes, and attending to our every need. In addition, I couldn't have asked for a more accommodating atmosphere for my nephew. One of our amazing servers even brought him a few toys as he explored the restaurant. They went above and beyond, and were so patient with us. Not to mention, it doesn't hurt that everyone working in the restaurant is both good looking and charming. Just adds to the warmth of the space.

Food: There ended up being three adults plus my nephew for dinner and we ordered every appetizer on the menu. The food was fantastic. Comfort food but with all the delicacy that you would expect from a really hip restaurant. Top billing goes to the brussel sprout and kale salad with chanterelle mushrooms and bacon. Absolutely wonderful; warm and flavorful, but still light and complex. Also amongst the favorites were the French fries with homemade ketchup and the charcuterie plate. All the dishes tied together beautifully and were made with both love and exceptional ingredients. Kudos to the chefs! For wine we drank a yummy (and generously poured) Rioja out of charming mason jars. 


I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out on the weekend and although I loved the layout and atmosphere, I would not return because of my disappointment with my entree. I ordered the clams, mussels, and lobster in a tomato broth and it was the smallest entree I have ever received. There were literally two mussels, six clams, a couple pieces of calamari and a piece of white fish sitting in a very shallow puddle of tomato broth; no lobster even! 

With that said, please still consider checking this place out if you aren't looking for a real sized meal. Their cocktail menu was interesting enough (I ordered the innovative kale caesar that recommended by the bartender. I was not a fan but my friend was so we easily switched) and their dessert bar had a few options. I do not recommend going if you are actually hungry."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and haven't gotten to eat anything.

First time was on an already hot summer day, for brunch, and where we were seated had hot air blowing on us (likely from the open kitchen). Add to that, the lackluster menu, we decided to leave.

Tried again yesterday for lunch, and after waiting at our table for 10-15 minutes, we were never approached by a server (although they were at the table next to us at one point). There were only 2 other tables, so they weren't busy. Obliviously we left. Ironically, as we left, the guy behind a counter thanked us for our business.

Only restaurant I have ever walked out of. 
And TWICE!

Disappointed, because I love most of the restaurants in my neighbourhood (Ronces), and had heard great things about this place."}
{"text":"Hey (meatball)  is a perfect set up for families with delicious food!  There is lots of space for kids (larger than most Roncy restaurants) and it's easy to make a quick get away because of up front counter service."}
{"text":"Hey! has what you'd want from a local brunch joint: cosy, lots of light, comfortable seating, beautiful design and good food...

BUT what they're lacking in is the reason why they're struggling in good reviews and repeat customers.

The prices are high, which at times can be understandable when you're menu is promoting sustainable and local goods, but a good business will not survive on this only.... Hey! Are big stingers. The value for what you get on your plate doesn't even come close to what they charge you.

I got a piece of quiche and it looked like it was missing 30%. It came with a small measly handful of mixed greens and two slivers of beats. Price tag $13.25. Crazy!! It was tasty, but I was still hungry and I'm hardly a big eater. 

Also service is strange. There seems to be so many people just standing around, hanging out. It took 10 minutes for our bill to arrive. There were at least three people standing by the open kitchen doing nothing that could have brought it.

If you want good food, good service, and good value go to Mitzi cafe. I swear by them.

Won't be back to Hey! Unless they can stop stinging and over charging. Regular glass of juice is $6.50!!! Where do they get off?"}
{"text":"Went to Hey last week for a late late afternoon snack (otherwise known as \"lupper\"). The restaurant was empty except for 5 other customers. I ordered a calzone, which was actually pretty yummy. My server was great, and things were looking pretty good until she vanished, never to be seen again! Left to my own devices, I finally got up and buttonholed a server who was playing close attention to the table next to me. She appeared quite indifferent when I complained, but did respond to my request for dessert. I found myself feeling grateful for the attention (always a bad sign in a restaurant). Of course, once it came time to pay my bill, she showed no signs of bringing it to my table until I has thrown on my coat, at this point considering the possibility of a dine and dash. 

Really Hey, really??? The restaurant is almost empty and your servers can't be bothered to look after their customers? Lame. And one last thing: you never serve bread pudding ice cold. It wasn't the most incredible bread pudding to start (Mabels up the street on Ronces owns that honor), but a little heat and a little whipped cream might just have warmed my inner bitch."}
{"text":"Delicious food, with polite, friendly service. I don't know much about decor but it seems to be a beautiful space. I like that you get a clear view of the kitchen so you don't have to wonder what's going on in there. Weekend brunch can get crowded/loud, but great place for dinner. The quiche is incredibly moist and is a must-try, as are the rosemary parmesan frites - with house-made ketchup, of course.

6/20/2014
This is now a Hey Meatball location. Fries are still good but I find their vegan sandwich overly salty. I really miss what this restaurant was."}
{"text":"Went a third time. Not brunch, not coffee but dinner. Waaaay better! I was full! The food was delicious as usual but served at the right temperature! They had wine! Better value for your money portion-wise. The \"kid\" portion was enormous! AND on the way out, I noticed a cute little corner where mom and pop could believe they were having dinner on their own with a little table beside it for the kid near the crayons. Brilliant. Service was still uneven (super attentive when not needed, non existent when it was) and chairs kinda uncomfortable but we'll be back. Glad we gave it another shot."}
{"text":"Awesome service! 

Hey burger is delicious! Best part is that they use Rowe farm organic beef. Mmm mmm good!

They also make their own 'ketchup'. It's quite delicious with the fries. 

I also tried the meatball sandwich, which I thought they have the perfect Marinara sauce. 

I asked for the soup as my side, their daily special happened to be the potato leek soup. Very tasty! Not too thick, not too runny, not too pungent either.

I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"We had the \"fry up\" breakfast (I think that's what it was called) and at $12 it was a treat, everything tasty and fresh, the bacon was outstanding, the sausage we were told is from Rowe farms, eggs cooked exactly as we asked, service outstanding."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, love the casual atmosphere but not the organic house made ketchup.  The decor was great it felt like you were in someones country cabin, very cozy yet chill.  Yes I know bottled ketchup is not good for you but still somethings should be left alone!"}
{"text":"This venue's is so damn nice it's such a shame it is used so poorly. They have really made too many mistakes here. It's a big place and they attempt to offer diverse ingredients for our veggie vegan gluten free eaters. Nonetheless, when I went, it felt super disorganized and all over the place, the waitress flirted with my dad even though he was obviously with his gf and daughter. They had shitty beer, and there were huge pillows piled on the bench. Not a good evening vibe. Really hope something  new takes over. I love the space. If you DO go, get a salad and some wine and call it a night!!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. With it's connections to the successful Hey Meatball, and the gorgeous space they are in. Sadly, after all this time I feel they are still not living up to it.

I ordered the hamburger and side soup (cream of celery root). I was then asked if it was okay that they cook the burger medium here, and that it would be slightly pink. Which got me excited, and I said \"No that's great\". So I then had a lot of hope for the burger. If I was there again, I wouldn't order the burger. I'm trying to eat better these days, so when I eat a burger I need to make it count. It needs to be a good one.

It took a while to get our food, even though there were maybe only six tables with people, including us. Which is fine, but then you would hope there would be a lot of care put into the food... alas, there was not when it came to the burger. The burger was not pink in the middle as advertised. It was a good thickness, which I liked, but in that case it would be even harder to overcook it and dry it out. Besides the paddy, as individual elements there were good things going on. The tomato relish was nice on its own, but when slathered on the burger, it made it seem more meat loafy than a burger. The bun was good on it's own, but coupled with the well done burger, and lack of condiments left for a fairly dry experience. There was really nothing that brought the whole thing together, or what Guy Fieri would say... the kicker as well. The burger cried out for more condiments but there was none... There was cheese on the burger, but it was undetectable except in appearance. A good burger should either be a tasty well cooked paddy, or a burger with top notch condiments that just drool down on to your plate. This burger was neither.

To end on a good note. The cream of celery root soup was lovely. It was velvety and frothy and had nice depth to it as you kept eating. It is good to see they are capable of making good food with nice flavours, just maybe not made to order? I also had from the beet salad, and that was yummy as well. I think they can totally do soup and salad well, but I worry about their mains.

I tossed and turned about what rating to give Hey. 2/3s of the food I tasted was yummy, so I went in with a cautious three stars (60%). And I hope for better things in the future."}
{"text":"My gosh!! what's going on there! what and why all these bad reviews, especially on the service!?

I went there yesterday and had one of my best dinners over the past months! I was to write that this place is a pure jewel lost in Lansdowne area!

Food is inventive creative and a hit. Cookers behind open-concept kitchen really look like they enjoy working and love food. I had very good home-ceasar salad, terrine with veggies, fabulous smash and bangers, beef stew \"like at home when I was a child\", hey! brew is really good. I was too full to have desert! 

Atmosphere, as already written in other reviews, is very homey with heavy wood tables and cozy cushions if you like that. So nice!.

Waitresses were really OK or perhaps that is because ours spoke French, and French speaking people are much nicer, effective and attentive than non French speaking ones (because speaking French is painstakingly difficult, thus you need to be into what you do!). It is not a fast food for sure (go to MacDo down the street if you are in a hurry!)."}
{"text":"It would seem that Hey! has ironed out many of the kinks that previous reviews have mentioned, because some pals and I had a great experience this past weekend.

I ordered the squash gnocchi, which had really delicious pieces of brussel sprouts and other veggies in it.  My two friends ordered the pork shoulder and the bolognese, both of which were very good.  They make their pasta in-house and it was remarkably fresh.  

The wait staff informed us that they also make their desserts and sodas in-house.  My friend tried a cocktail with a house-made soda and it was really tasty.  

Our dessert, a zucchini chocolate cake, was superbly legit: not too sweet, not too dense or light, the icing was thick but melted in the mouth.  It left you with that extra-satisfied-but-not-bloated feeling good desserts tend to do.  

The ambience is homey and cozy but maintains a certain level of formality suited to the quality--and price--of the food.  We were seated right above the kitchen and had ample ogling time at the other dishes being prepared.  I have a feeling I'll make the effort to return and try them!"}
