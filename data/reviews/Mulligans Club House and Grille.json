{"text":"I love this place! I have been looking for a place to go on weekends that has allot of people and allows smoking. I have been  hanging at a few dives around the Harmar, Cheswick, & Springdale but was never comfortable and really haven't been having much fun. Thank goodness for this bar/restaurant. I am down there every Tuesday for their awesome \"all you can eat\" crablegs. Occasionally I go down for \"Name this tune\" on Wednesday but I am always down there on Saturdays. I love the atmosphere and people down there. I always have a great time, and the menu, wow. I expected a limited menu with nothing but bar food but there is so much wonderful food to choose from that I don't know what to get when I go to eat with the family or friends.  I definately have been telling my friends & coworkers to come down with me everytime.
Also, apparently they have a signature dish called the mandog?
Try and go down with friends, you as well as them will be highly impressed as I was.

This place IS the best kept secret in town."}
{"text":"Nice bar to go to in an area mostly full of dives.  Happy hour half off all drinks and appetizers.  Tried a steak sub which to my surprise had real steak on it very good but don't order the nachos unless you like the cheese found at most gas stations.  Lots of wood In the bar and a fireplace makes it feel cozy.  We were there to watch a penguin game the tv's are located well and they kept the sound up for us.  The karaoke dj waited for the game to conclude before starting.  I know there is a second bar downstairs but did not check it out.  If you go with a lot of people ask for separate checks or they will put it together and you will be left drunk trying to figure out who owes what."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly fun bar located in an area in need of \"surprisingly fun bars\".  This building has been home to many bar/restaurants throughout the years and it seems that finally this one may stick.  It's located in Harmerville, right off the turnpike.  I live across the river and it's relatively convenient for me, but I imagine it wouldn't really be a destination spot if you weren't already in the area.  The reason that I've been here a few times recently is that an old high school friend, George is the current bartender.  George is a pro and very good at the art of tending bar.  The bar/restaurant is kind of seperated into two bars in one location.  The upstairs is more family dining calmer laid back fare and the downstairs where George works is more of a bar bar with dark lighting, darts, pool tables and drunk people.  I was there last night downstairs and it was relatively empty.  However, the first time I was there it was packed because It was name that tune night or something like that with a dj.  The food seems to be pretty good and I'd say it's a bit more upscale bar food than typical bar food.  I had a burger the first time I went that was cooked well, seasoned nicely and I think served wtih sweet potatoe fries.  I didn't have anything to eat last night as my diet consisted mainly of liquids.  I've never ordered wine here, but I'm guessing there isn't much of a list.  They have guiness on tap George makes a very stiff jack and coke.  The space upstairs is nice with a lot of wood, a golf theme and plenty of plasmas.  The downstairs as I mentioned is darker and more for the drinking crowd.  Another weird thing is that somehow they are able to let people smoke downstairs because there is a separate entrance, so if you are a smoker you'll probably appreciate not having to go outside.  All in all a pretty good bar with decent bar food and good service.  I can't think of any other bars in that area that can really compete with this place."}
