{"text":"During my initial 3 minute visit to Twisted Café, I found an interesting freshly baked Chimney Bun. The bun was crispy outside, mellow soft inside, and I saw on the menu that they used apple sauce and potatoes instead of milk and eggs as ingredient for the buns. It also comes in the following flavours: cinnamon sugar, vanilla, chocolate, almond, coconut, and walnut flavours. They also have espresso machine; next time I should try their Espresso. Minus one star for the service, because I want to try the chocolate flavour chimney bun instead cinnamon sugar; I do not know why they won't make chocolate flavour sad face for me. Anyways, be advised they only take cash payments. Good luck if you can pick your chimney bun flavours."}
{"text":"Just went to Crossroads Farmer's Market and checked out Twisted Café for my first time... I had to try the famous Chimney Cake, and OMGGGG. Honestly, one of the best things I have ever eaten!!! 
I am a donut, cake, beaver tail lover and this is in my top 3 for sure!! It doesn't have that gross deep fry flavor or smell, it's not heavy, it has just the perfect crunch,
I could go on... I got mine rolled in walnuts, cinnamon sugar and vanilla... Wow wow WOWWW! I will be back!! I sat and ate the entire thing in just a few mins.. Best part about it, it was only $4 for small and it was the size of a 1L bottle of water! If you're gonna cheat or indulge in something, I highly recommend the CHIMNEY CAKE!!"}

After wandering through the Crossroads Market one day we stumbled across this little place called the Twisted Cafe by one of the main entrance's and across from the honey sellers.  These funnel cake type looking things caught our eye.  And so we did what any curious food thrill seeker would do....we inquired and we purchased one to share along with some coffee.  And we were hooked.

Chimney Cakes (an ancient Transylvanian street food) are actually Hungarian Kurtoskalacs....a sweet, spiral shaped Hungarian Pastry.  This melt in your mouth treat comes out of the oven super hot and are rolled in your choice of chocolate, coconut, cinnamon, walnuts or cinnamon sugar.  They are super delicious and the Hungarian family that owns the cafe super friendly.

It is now a habit, every time we go to the Crossroads Market to purchase 1 (usually more) more chimney cakes as a treat...they are just that good.  The coffee here is also the best in the market."}
