{"text":"I use to love going here, but since the name change, they kind of stiff you. Never really have been a fan of the food, but their wings are definitely something to try. But if you're going just to hangout and have a few beers, buying a pitcher is not the way to go. I'm serious, my grandmother, who has lost fingers from diabetes, could pour a better, more professional pitcher of beer. It's $7 for a domestic pitcher, and you only get 3/4 of a pitcher, that's if it's not full of foam. Seriously, it doesn't take a genius to do it, and if you're getting the customers, you shouldn't have to resort to screwing them over by charging full price for 3/4 of a pitcher. That's not a deal, that's a crime. Also, their \"Pop'a Shot\" doesn't keep score, so don't waste your money. I give two stars for the atmosphere and the hockey rink."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! We went there on a Saturday night, it was crowded so we were seated in the area with the pool tables and pinball machines, which is not problem as long as we could see the tv for the hockey game.   We completely understood the business as I was a bartender previously and held our patience for the most part.  At one point it was over a half hour from when the waiter asked us if we would like a refill until we saw him again.  I went up to the bar and immediately got served but could not find our waiter.  He apologized and took our food order.  The food was nothing I would come back for and the service after that was still slow.  The thing that REALLY ticked us off was that for 4 people and 2 separate checks we both wrote in the tip and total took a copy and left.  On Monday, BOTH OF US WERE OVER CHARGED!  One 30 dollars and the other 5.  It was as if he wrote over our slips once we left.  AND to top it off even though the experience was TERRIBLE, both of us tipped over 20% to begin with!!  I will NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Zucchini plates were 2 inches wide and 6\" long fabulous. Iceberg wedge also hit the spot. Highly recommend for anyone waiting for their hockey player."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to give 1 star.  If I had the option to give none, I would. I went to this establishment in July 2016 and sat at the bar for faster service. It was a Tuesday evening, so they weren't busy at all (approx. 4 people at the bar) and the two bartenders laughed and stacked clean glasses while I waited patiently. After a while, the one girl asked for my drink order, she returned it quickly and then brought me a menu. After she dropped off the menu, she never returned!  She was laughing with other customers, joking around with the other wait staff, and wiping off the counter continuously. After 25 minutes of waiting, my husband and I grew angry. He left $2 for his pop and we walked out and went elsewhere for a late dinner. This place either (A) does not properly train their employees or hold them to a high standard or (B) does not care about their customers. What a shame!  We will not be returning, especially since their are many other fantastic options in Southpointe."}
{"text":"Great spot for a thirst quenching Yuengling on tap and listening to local bands, all while you enjoy some delicious wings.  If you get in before 9 you pay no cover charge. Great food, good people amazing time."}
{"text":"watch the pens, drink beer, eat food, play volleyball... love"}
{"text":"Pros: Cool view of a hockey rink, lots of drinks, plenty of beers on tap  Cons:  Food is not very good.  I had nachos and a bleu cheese burger.  The nachos were cheap and unimpressionable.  The burger just didn't taste very good, kind of bland, and the \"set-up\" of lettuce and tomato was of very poor quality.  They served some cheap onion rings with my meal that looked identical to the cheapest grocery store freezer section product.   If you want to grab some drinks out, surely this place is fine (it comes from a bottle they didn't make), but from a food standpoint, I will not eat at this restaurant again. Actually, I didn't feel very well for the rest of the day; not sure if it was due to poor food quality, but I eat a lot of bar grub and rarely feel that way.  (Third edit of this review, I am struggling because I don't want to completely rip on this restaurant (bar area is cool), but if you want food, don't go, crappy fast food is 20x better.)"}
{"text":"Get the Penne noodle with vodka sauce, and the teriyaki wings."}
{"text":"Pretty cool lunch spot. The shrimp salad was delicious. I do want to mention that the tap water tasted terrible here, so I recommend you get a soft drink instead."}
{"text":"Restaurant-bar adjacent to Southpointe Icoplex, overlooking ice hockey rink! Good service, fair prices, and great munchy food with lots of options but not too many. Clean, fun environment."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with my wife and screaming kid (yes we were those people) on a Sunday afternoon.  Service was very good despite the number of tables this poor kid was waiting on. He was attentive without being overbearing. I got the wings which had delicious wing sauce. They could have been done a little more but that's ok. I also had the Italian hoagie. A little more meat would have been nice but overall it was tasty. This was our first time but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends for dinner. The wings were excellent and my salad was gigantic.   I would definitely give the food 4 out of 5 starts, but the service was rather slow and our waitress rarely asked if we needed anything else.   However, the outdoor patio was really a lovely place to sit and chat and the novelty of being able to see people play hockey from inside the bar is very worth the trip. A great place to go for a thirsty sports fan and a good place to grab some grub."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. Haven't been back since. I got the wedding soup that had so much salt added to it I wasn't able to eat it. Next I tried the shrimp salad to give it the food another try that same night cause the whole reason I went there was to eat. It was HORRIBLE. I bit into the shrimp and it was gritty and still frozen. Will never go back."}
