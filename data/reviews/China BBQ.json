{"text":"Great skewers, cheap beer, good (English) music. This place was awesome. The other reviewer that mentioned the service was bad must not have been to 90% of he other Chinese places in the area. The service here was amazing. Prompt, and very friendly waitresses. Go here. Go with a big group. This will end up being one of your go to BBQ spots real quick. 

P.s. I do not know the owners or anyone else here. This is based on my dinner here last night."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night for dinner.  The restaurant was rather empty.  The servers spoke Mandarin with minimal Cantonese and English speaking proficiency.  However, the digital menu on the iPad has English descriptions.  With the iPad, you can see exactly what your total cost will be.    

We ordered a variety of skewers, a cabbage dish, and a spicy soup.  The food was generally well made.  When you place the other, the server will ask you what spice level you prefer.  I would recommend the lamb skewers.  They were tasty and flavorful.  They also serve Presotea,  The downfall is that it is cash only.  For an establishment that has iPads for ordering, they should accept card payments."}
{"text":"We had a blast celebrating Chinese New Years Eve. Won some great prizes !! This place has very friendly staffs and cheap beers ! The BBQ grill was good but a little too spicy, the best was chicken Skewers and chives. 

Best of all, they are open until 3:00am"}
{"text":"I did my Yelp research and learned about their Tuesday half-price lamb skewers ($2 for 4). It's one of my bf's all-time fave foods so I knew it was going to be a successful outing. True to the reviews, Tuesday night is pretty empty. Major language barrier (Mandarin only), iPad system, cash only, ATM on site. (It's great to know the reviews are fulfilling its purpose, right?) We waited about 15 min for our skewers to come, it smelled amazing, straight off the grill. Not too lean, not too fatty. The skewers are showered abundantly with spices; about 3-4 skewers in, it became totally overpowering. But I ain't complaining, because at $2/4, I couldn't be happier :) I guess next time I could request for less seasoning, but you'll have to learn how to say that in Mandarin! A great late night snack to pair with a drink.. mmm~ Haven't tried anything else, but just for this I'm down to come back any Tuesday!"}
{"text":"3.5? 4? Somewhere in-between. The food is a 4. The service loses them some stars, for the most part. There was one table occupied when we got here around 6:30pm (Valentines Day, mind you). By the time we left, there were probably at least 8 tables occupied. Service is still quite difficult. The servers really struggle with languages other than Mandarin. They do have one waitress (or manager) who speaks Cantonese, but she wasn't there for most of the night. She was very nice though. She gave us heart chocolates before we left. 

We ordered a number of things on the menu that they ran out of. Some of those they told us about as soon as they tried to place our order and found out they were out of stock. One, however, they did not tell us about until we had received everything else we had ordered. Then, they asked us if we wanted to order something to replace it. We declined. We didn't want to have to wait as they made us something else.

On Tuesdays, they have half price lamb skewers. Regular price, they're $4.99/4. That means today, they were $2.50/4. At that price, I don't care if they don't really taste like lamb. If they taste like meat and cumin, I'm getting them. Some of the ones we had were on the dry side, but some of them were also fairly juicy. I'd come again to get them (on a Tuesday, mind you). We didn't know if there were limitations on how many we could order at half price. We ended up ordering two orders. We asked the waitress if both orders were half price. She took it to mean that we wanted half an order of skewers, and she said we could only get them in quantities of 4 skewers, which is how many come in one order. We struggled back and forth for a while before she got another waitress to come over and we cleared things up.

The cumin chicken rack ($2.99) is a decent portion of chicken bones with meat scraps. The sauce on these is delicious. It's slightly sweet, slightly spicy, slightly smokey, and fairly savory. It's quite complex. We enjoyed it a lot. It could have been hotter, temperature-wise. My dad said he had a piece that was still cold. That was slightly worrying. Most of it was quite warm though.

The BBQ chile ($3.99) is quantified as in a dish. It's not chili. It's chive, if the translation I'm using is correct. A dish has three skewers and each skewer has a good number of these chives threaded to it. It's oilier than I expected it to be, but I still quite enjoyed this dish as well. It's unique. 

Dried bean curd kebab ($3.99/4). While I enjoyed this dish, the price to portion ratio was way off. These were not rolls of bean curd. These were dried bean curd strips (not bean curd stick kind of sheets, but the textured dried bean curd) on skewers, one strip per skewer. In other words, this was 4 thin strips of tofu for $4. I do really like how the edges of the tofu were crisp though.

My favorite dish of the night went to the skewered fish ($5.99). In English, it says the portion is (1), or presumably, 1 fish. In Chinese, it says 1 portion. When we received it, we had 3 decent-sized fish on skewers. I was quite concerned. We had to call a waitress over to make sure she didn't put in 3 orders for us by accident. Thankfully, with a little bit of struggle communicating, we figured out that this was indeed the correct portion, and that a portion could have 3-4 fish depending on the sizes of the fish. The fish were super crispy on the outside, and the flesh was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I basically ate the entire fish save for the spine. The tail and the head were the crispiest part. Yes, eating the head looks gross, but there's something to be said about knowing you're eating the fish's teeth (yes, rows of teeth you could eat), and finding them deliciously crunchy. At $5.99, I'd come to get them for lunch if they were open for lunch, but they're not. A light dinner it is, I suppose.

I'll come again for the food. I'll put up with the service. The fish and those 1/2 price lamb skewers are worth it."}
{"text":"Beef skewer is pretty good here.  Service is so so because of the language barrier.  Food also comes out pretty slow despite lower traffic.  Priced well for what it is.  Presto tea inside so that's a plus.  
Protip:  Cash only, despite visa/interac logos at he entrance"}
{"text":"We came here due to Destiny's next door being closed before it was supposed to be, and we kind of eenie meenie mo'd the restaurants next door and decided to go to this one! We had never been to a restaurant where the main food was skewers but it was really good! Some amazing dishes included beef and lamb skewers, chicken heart skewers, house special fried rice, squid tentacles, sweet corn with egg yolk, pork belly and CLAMSSSS. Most of the meats we got were seasoned the same spiced with I think cumin as the main one, but it still let the flavour shine through. I recommend getting something like the sweet corn with egg yolk to have in between the strong flavour kind of like what people do with wings and celery. If you get the pork belly, keep the sauce you dip it in for the entire meal! It's really good.

Looking at previous reviews I was really perplexed, the service was really good, they spoke English and even if they did it was mainly, \"hi can we get spoons and water\" because the ordering system was on the iPad in which you could tell the prices of each item! 

I will warn you, some of the dishes were pretty oily, mainly the seafood fried rice, I urge you to get the house special instead, and the meat dishes that were not skewers....but the flavour was still amazing. 

Lastly, they only took cash, I was informed the POS was down, but we got a 20 percent promo discount, I don't know if we came late and that's why it was down and gave us a promo, or it was just a promo night, but it got our bill down from 120ish to 105ish. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was poor to mediocre at best. Beef pancake was very salty and the cucumber jelly fish cold dish was extremely sour and tasteless all in the same plate! 

Services was terrible...Severely understaffed, they forgot two of our orders and left us hanging for 40 minutes despite us repeatedly trying to signal the waitress. Had to leave without having our orders fulfilled..."}
{"text":"Just an average place to chill, get a couple of drinks and snacks. 

We went on a Saturday night 11:30pm and it was relatively quiet(I think there were 3 tables occupied) Ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of a club, or bar. The lights are dim and music is quite loud - i wouldn't suggest anyone coming here to discuss about serious matters. 

We ordered scallops and lamb kebob. Food is decently priced but drinks are priced a bit cheaper than other places."}
{"text":"The food was meh. I would rather to go Chatbar next door.
On their menu they had Pork Intestines, which we ordered and turns out it was sausages. When I questioned them they said it is indeed pork intestine sausages? A little play on words but it definitely was not pork intestines. It tasted like the Filipino sausages, which are super juicy and sweet. I mean it tasted good, but its just not the meat I asked for.
I felt their menu was lacking, and I didn't see much that I wanted to order. Tried the usual beef and lamb, and both were super chewy and not tender at all. The seasoning is good, but I think the quality of the meat is more important.

The atmosphere was nice, like the concept was interesting - to have a DJ mixer and giant tv screens playing chinse shows, and with all the lights making it look like a club/bar, but the food was just not good. 
Service was horrible too. They don't respond to you when you ask questions, it's almost as if you just assume that she understood and is going to follow up for you."}
