{"text":"I came to this place for dinner during my trip to Montreal. I ordered the cold salad roll and beef noodle in soup. The food was decent. The salad roll was a bit small. The noodle only had beef and some onions in it (usually it comes with basil, bean sprouts and lime in authentic Vietnamnese restaurants). The taste was good. I didn't specify what size of the noodle I wanted and the waiter automatically got me a large, which was massive! I wish he ha clarified before ordering for me! Overall this place was okay but I probably won't come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Pathetic food. Had to leave the meal in the middle. There are plenty of better choices in chinatown for chinese food. Never visiting this place again."}
{"text":"C'est toujours une bonne option de venir ici durant mon  dîner,  le service y est rapide et efficace, sans compter que les repas y sont abordables. Généralement, je commandes le plat avec poulet grillé et vermicelle et c'est toujours bon."}
{"text":"I This is a typical Asian food greasy spoon, disguised a a trendy fast food outfit. Service was very poor, or,  worst, non existent. The owner-waiter showed up three times: to take  the order and to deliver the dishes. We were a party of five. 
The food was very very ordinary and not worth the money. 
At the end of the meal I had to go to the cashier myself because the server was not showing up. Yet they were not busy, there were only two additional tables inside with two customers each. 
To add to the bad experience, the owner-waiter at the time of presenting the bill added an 18% service charge. I suspect he thought we were tourists, but he later claimed that they do that for all groups of five or more... regardless of the lack of service. I reminded him that I did not have to pay the service charge, but, in the circumstances, etc., I paid it, but I now regret it. But I am also taking my revenge : I will not be visiting the place again (we had been there before)... and I get to write this review. 
Avoid it!"}
{"text":"L'intérêt principal de ce restaurant asiatique est la taille plus que généreuse des assiettes et des bols. Les soupes sont très bonnes et les plats variés. Difficile de rater son coup en mangeant là-bas, surtout pour le lunch. Mais attention, il faut arriver tôt, c'est très populaire."}
{"text":"really just a waste of money and calories. Unimpressive fare that left me really thirsty after. Very full  during the lunch rush hour, I am assuming because of it's location since the food leaves a lot to be desired.

Worst part was after paying the woman at the cash kept insisting that we leave her a tip, when we didn't understand what she was saying at first because it was so busy, she began angrily demanding a tip. 

I am usually a good tipper, no need to yell at me for one. Found this quite gauche."}
{"text":"Overpriced | Low quality food | Below standard service | Horrible attitude | Not satisfying | Do not recommend

This little Chinese-owned noodle/rice place is located near the Eaton Center. Great location but horrible service and food. The quantity and quality is not worth the price you are paying ($9.50- $15). They do accept credit and debit cards. 

The pho-style noodles were made too al dente, not authentic Vietnamese style. The portions were small. I ordered #8 which should have came with raw beef, tendon and beef balls. My friend and I ordered the same thing, neither of our bowls had tendons and the portions were definitely barely enough for the price you are paying. The bean sprouts, lime and mint looks old too.

The photos printed at door-front looks nothing like what you really get at the end. 

The service, mostly the attitude, was what lowered my 2-star rating to a 1-star rating. 

As we were paying with our credit cards, the options of 15%/ 20%/ other tips were shown. Because of the food, I decided to only give 10%, after the lady saw what I tipped, she murdered something along the lines of \"... minimum...\", continued without saying thank you turned around and walked away rudely. Once she got back to the cashier area she gave me a disgusting cut-eye dirty look. They speak Cantonese so I am fully aware of what they are saying. One of my other friend paid in cash, the lady counted in front of us as if we will not pay enough. She also mumbled something to another associate after taking the cash back.

I have worked in the food industry before, if your food/ service/ environment deserves it, I will pay 20%+ tips.  But if you have room for improvement, I will let you know too. The way she reacted to our tip is probably worst than the food not meeting standards.

I will not return and do not recommend Soupebol Nouillerie."}
{"text":"Mes pad thai préféré de montreal!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ventured into Soupebol for a quick lunch and I guess we came during the lunch \"rush hour\".   Even though the restaurant looks tiny from the outside, the dining area was quite large and people (including us) were able to find a table pretty immediately upon entering.  It's almost a good thing we came during lunch since others were in and out of there immediately.

This restaurant has a pretty neat concept of noodles served Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Filipino, and Thai style as far as I could tell.  They have both dry and wet noodle options and also serve rice options for those who do not feel like noodles.

The husband ordered Pansit (Filipino) and I ordered Grilled Beef Vermicelli (Vietnamese).  We were surprised by the large portions and could have split the pansit between the two of us.  The food and service was good.  I loved how the ingredients were fresh and the sauces for the noodles were not too overpowering.

I would come back again, even at lunch hour."}
{"text":"I really love Singapore noodles.... In my option they have the best one in my taste.  Also soup with coconut milk and seafood is amazing.  Pad tai is pretty good.  However fried rolls always overfried."}
{"text":"I'm pleased to report that they are back to their former greatness. The wonton soup is world-class again. Massive bowl for $10 with a generous portion of wonton's, vegetables and nooodles. Nothing like it on a cold winter day in Montreal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mettons que ça vaut pas vraiment le détour, mais que c'était correct pour un dîner rapide entre collègues. J'ai pris la soupe Tom Yum aux fruits de mer. Les crevettes étaient très bonnes, mais les pétoncles et la goberge étaient BEAUCOUP trop cuits. Par contre, le bouillon était bien assaisonné et j'ai apprécié la quantité sans compromis de citronnelle. Bref, une soupe bien, mais pas transcendante. De plus, j'ai goûté au poulet général Tao de ma collègue et il y avait beaucoup de trop de sauce à mon goût. On s'y perdait un peu. À recommander si vous êtes pressé, mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Unorganized.  Food is okay. Not the best. Pricy for the quality. Worst is they ask for tips. Be careful if your paying with cards. They going to enter the amount of tips on the terminal. They said 15% but put 16% or more.

Just walk maybe less than 10 to chinatown for better and cheaper food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, bad food and unreasonable price! One middle-aged Chinese waiter was super rude to me!(The one who is always wearing a cap) Will never come back!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah 3 1/2 étoiles! C'est un peu un pot-pourris comme resto asiatique. On y sert les classiques mais aussi du Phô, du General Tao, des nouilles, etc..Vraiment beau bon pas cher. J'ai bien aimé mon pho aka Soupe Tonkinoise sur le menu au boeuf et tendons. Pas exceptionnel mais pour 9,00, vraiment pas mal du tout.  Rien de wow comparé à Toronto ou certains autres endroits de Montréal mais vraiment potable."}
