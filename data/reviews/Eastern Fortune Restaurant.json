{"text":"We've been here several times for birthday dinners and the food is usually fresh and flavorful.  This last time there were a couple of dishes that missed the mark namely the peking pork chops and tofu hot pot.  However the crispy chicken was a perfect balance of crispiness and juicy chicken.  Also another favorite is the green beans with minced pork and preserved olives.  It may not sound all that appetizing but the combo is delish.  Be prepared for limited parking and small cramped quarters along with hit & miss service in exchange for some of the better tasting authentic chinese food in town."}
{"text":"Eastern fortune is always a great place to I eat. Whether its for dinner with your family or at 2am with your friends. The food is delicious. I particularly enjoy the salt and pepper tofu and the pork chops with the sauce (I can never remember what it's called) but very delish. Eastern fortune is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. Highly recommend it especially if you want a late night meal."}
{"text":"This is where one dines for truly authentic Cantonese food. Be adventurous, they do have ginger beef but that is as Chinese as pizza. They do not serve westernized combo fare so do not look for it.

I eat here an average of once a month and have never been served a meal I did not enjoy. The service is amazingly attentive, the staff take the time to translate the Chinese only menu, food is prepared promptly, and the portions are ooohh so huge but albeit, a wee tad on the pricey side but definitely value for the money.

On the menu, make sure you ask for the Chinese menu, you will find items you never new humans ate. Sweetmeats (do not ask) are a soup specialty and yummy. Pigeon, quail, and partridge are all wonderfully gamey all dark meat surprises. The lobster or crab with ginger and green onion are fall out of the shell tender and succulent beyond your wildest dreams. The have a dish with egg tofu on the bottom and jumbo scallops on top marinated in fish sauce, light soy, and ginger that is served with chili oil on the side that will tantalize your taste buds like never before. Try the Hakka noodle dishes or the beef chow fun. Like any Chinese restaurant, they also serve rice. I recommend steamed rice as fried rice will overpower the delicateness of the food they prepare.

Two people should expect to spend $50 and up. Almost 100 percent of their clientelle at any given time is Chinese. This is one of Calgary's best kept secrets for Cantonese food and they are open when everyone else is closed."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for a few years now because the food's pretty tasty and consistent. The owners recently retired and sold the restaurant so I was worried the food wouldn't be as good. I ordered some of my usual dishes and it tasted pretty much the same. I love the fried tofu with crab sauce because it has a thin crispy batter and its smooth and creamy inside. The steamed oysters are fresh and delicious. I tried two new dishes on the menu and it was alright. I'll be back for my go to dishes and maybe some of the new northern dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Didn't know about it till earlier this year, and this is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant. My favorite dish is Jelly fish with Chicken (served cold) but it tastes fantastic with rice. Not a lot of Caucasian people know about this place, most people you see in the restaurant are Chinese. But this is not Cantonese food...it's Chiu Chow (not Canton). I've had couple other dishes there as well and they never fail to impress me =) This is my top choice whenever we go out with friends =)"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night with a large group of people, who were mostly Japanese, Filipino, and Chinese. The food was already ordered when I arrived at 10:15. It's crazy to me that people eat dinner so late, but I hear that Asians do.

Some of the dishes were good. One was really awful (bitter melon? yuck) but they were all very oily. We had lobster which was awesome, a chicken dish with snow peas and walnuts that was also very good, and some shrimp balls that I also really liked. It was strange because we only received one dish at a time for most of them. People were requesting rice with the other dishes, which didn't arrive till almost last. It was the same with some noodle dishes that I would consider sides, they really should have come out much sooner. 

The service was not great. I do not expect great service at a Chinese restaurant, but after reading reviews here about the service, I thought it would be better. My drink was empty a few times and it seemed like they were annoyed when I asked for another. Maybe it was the time of night, but it wasn't that late if they stay open till 2 am.

I would consider going back to this restaurant if I knew I would be choosing the dishes I'd be eating, and hope that the timing of the dishes would be better. All in all, it was just an ok experience."}
{"text":"Under new management since Sep 2015. Foods were ok, good service, best dishes were jumbo oyster & sticky rice."}
{"text":"This was our first time here for a late night dinner.  I was starving after accompanying for a fundraiser concert!  Be prepared to drive into a crowded parking lot and you might even have to wait for a table at 11pm!    Delicious food! The garlic dow miu (pea shoots) were sauteed to perfection in a garlic sauce, the crispy chicken had the right amount of crunch but was still juicy, salt and pepper squid was lightly battered and not swimming in grease, and the seafood soup was served in a tasty broth base.  I was a bit disappointed in the oyster omelette though; I would have liked more oysters in it and a softer omelette (it was a bit odd to have crunchy scrambled eggs...)
      The service, however, was average.   It was hard to get the server's attention when we were ready to place our order and our teapot mysteriously disappeared during the middle of our dinner.    I don't know about the condition of the washrooms since I usually don't use washrooms in Chinese restaurants..."}
{"text":"There are only a few meals in one's life that can be considered the best meal of your life for various reasons, e.g. the company you're with, location of dining experience, level of skill required to prepare the dishes, fact that you're on vacay. I'm basing my review on the ingredients, quality of execution, and exemplary service. Jack, the General Manager, welcomed us on a Saturday evening with a friendly, unpretentious manner. The restaurant itself is in a non-descript strip mall with plain decor. 

We were a group of 6 and were seated right away. The place was packed and humming with happy, satisfied patrons. We immediately noticed the dishes that other tables ordered and there was a theme of steamed oysters, jelly fish and baby octopus cold appetizer, and tofu. We ordered the beef tenderloin with green and red peppers, steamed oysters, in house made tofu with crab sauce and broccoli, jelly fish and octopus cold plate, and the mustard and pork stomach soup. I know, the name of the soup is not appetizing but, the flavour was complex balance of savoury, spiced with white pepper corns and a hint of acidity that cut across any heaviness. The bursts of flavour from every bite was truly overwhelming. I highly recommend our menu items to anyone who appreciates complex flavours, impeccably executed textures and temperature of food. My benchmark for foods - I'm a serious food connoisseur who experiences dining at places ranging from 5 star Michelin restaurants to hole in the wall establishments for sheer pleasure. You're welcome -- enjoy the best meal of your life! Life is short!"}
{"text":"Found this place late night. Amazing authentic Cantonese good. Just order by the pictures and proportion is a lot bigger than expected. Beef so tender and fried squid is amazing."}
{"text":"Seek and you shall find the diamond in the rough!  Drop in for dinner or even late night Chinese food and your taste buds will be impressed. I have been here multiple times: take-out, late night, and for a special event. Every time I visit I always leave more than satisfied. 

A surprise highlight are the cold plates. The jellyfish and chicken are bursting with umami flavour. The cold meats are also tender and have an amazing taste that lingers making you reach for more helpings. Other favourites here include the mapo tofu, salt and pepper squid, and the special chow mein which are great staples. 

A notable thing here is the 10-course set dinner. I spoke with the manager of the restaurant to plan an event and he was very helpful and welcoming. Not to mention, the food was top notch and something I would definitely recommend you to try. I definitely want to go back for many meals here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Chiu Chow cuisine, you've come to the right place at Eastern Fortune Restaurant.  They are famous for their

- salted preseved mustard greens with pig intestines ( Chiu Chow soup) - the pig intestines are nicely sliced up and served in a steaming bowl of delicious broth and spiced nicely with cracked white peppercorns
- loh shway ap (marinated duck)
- ho peng (oyster omelette)
- any Chiu Chow dishes

Of course, they also serve other types of Chinese dishes that you are used to but their specialy is Chiu Chow.  

I'll be back again to sample their other dishes.  

After 9 p.m., they usually serve the traditional Chiu Chow little dishes with plain congee.  The restaurant is open till 2:30 a.m.!  Great for those hunger pangs late at night!"}
{"text":"A good friend had a craving for late night Chinese.  With hearing talk all day about stampede's midway menu that boasts some different delicacies including mealworm pizza...I thought why not be food adventurous in my own back yard?! I enjoy going to Chinese restaurants and ordering at least 1 item that isn't your typical ginger beef or salt & pepper squid (which I do love btw and always order it). Tonight we saw on the menu pig intestine....what the heck, let try it. Not bad! Has a fattier texture than tripe, the taste reminds me of pork belly.  Definitely a heavier dish...so if you're calorie counting probably not the dish for you. We also ordered the jelly fish and chicken cold plate as per other yelpers' suggestions, DELICIOUS! So thank you yelpers! Service was fast, food came out in 10 minutes, and prices average $10 per dish. Not the most aesthetically pleasing restaurant but an extensive menu, fast food and good prices."}
