{"text":"The poutine was nasty. It smells AWFUL in there. USE FEBREEZE. The cheese on the poutine was gross and the fries were frozen and had mo SALT on them. They put gravy first. Y'all really tried it, calling that filth poutine. The seasoning on the food had little to no flavour at all, at the end of my meal I had felt sick. Also, can't y'all afford A/C? There were a lot of flies in their lights. Improve your food please. Thanks."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza All fresh ingredients. They even make their pizza dough from scratch. Surprisingly low prices too!"}
