{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed to be honest. I was a regular at the old Victory Cafe for years and was cautiously excited about it's grand re-opening on Bloor. I knew it would't have the charm of a big sun-drenched patio anymore but I was still expecting something special.  Basically, if you've been to the Crafty Coyote across the street, you've been to the new Victory Cafe. The owners (who also own the aforementioned Crafty Coyote) have cloned the same bar and put it right across the street. I'm not sure why they did this but I can see cannibalization being an issue with this strategy eventually.  I'll give it 3 stars because it isn't the worst place to go, it's fine... it's just more of the same and that saddens me :("}
{"text":"We had to leave after being completely ignored & getting no service. The waitress looked right at us & served the white couple with the blond baby who came in after us, then continued ignoring us. Nope."}
{"text":"Why maintain the name if absolutely nothing else was retained from the original? I miss the old dive bar and drink prices. That said, beer selection was decent and service was first class, which was exactly what the old location was not known for."}
{"text":"As mentioned in other reviews, this is nothing like the old Victory Café.  I went on a Sunday mid-afternoon and they only had a pizza menu and a brunch menu.  I didn't get it, but I'm glad to see they kept the mac and cheese that the old location had.  Other than that I wasn't terribly impressed by the menu.  They have a good selection of beer though.  I did have the home fries and they were pretty good (nothing to write home about, but they were hot and tasted like home fries).  The vibe and décor is very different from the old Victory Café.  Apart from the name, I wouldn't have even realised it was the same place.  It seems to be exactly the same as the Crafty Coyote across the street, but the Crafty Coyote at least has more food items I would want to eat.    Overall, as someone who frequented the old Victory Café, I was pretty disappointed in the new Victory Café and as I don't live in the Annex I probably won't go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were VERY excited to check out this new Annex spot, but we were quickly disappointed. Not only was the staff rude, but they treated us extremely poorly when we opted for iced tea instead of alcohol. The food is also sub-par. Bruschetta? is supposed to have more than 2 diced cherry tomatoes on a piece of stale bread. This place has a very pretentious vibe but does not deliver enough quality to justify it. Also the communal table thing...not something I'm?into?o if I'm? looking to have a sit-down? meal with a friend. Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Not super impressed with this place. I was a big fan of the old one. I don't get this one, it weirdly looks the same as Crafty Coyote across the street. I guess it has the same owners. Why have two competing and very similar businesses across the street from one another? Also, the pizza was not that good...just because you inherit a pizza oven with the building doesn't automatically mean that you make great pizza. The servers are not particularly friendly, in fact one of them made a rude joke about my friend to their face which really surprised me. It's stuffy, it's stiff, and I would love for someone to tell me how exactly it is any different from the bar across the street. Don't settle for some generic bar (that has a good beer selection, but that is also very common these days) that is just riding on the fumes of its previous successes. There have been 4 different businesses in that property in the last 10 years, and I'm sure in no time, this new Victory will follow that trend because it brings nothing new to the 'table', and it is literally a copy of a restaurant across the street."}
{"text":"Really basically nothing like the old Victory Cafe. Just another overly expensive chalk board beer bar with no past and no future."}
{"text":"Wow finally they've open up on bloor street west and it's so beautiful and they make wicket pizza and they have a very large selection of scotch and Irish whiskey as well as a huge selection of Ontario craft brewers"}
{"text":"I had some stout to start first, then I ordered seafood pizza. The pizza was cooked over fire which is different from other places and I like this better than oven baked pizzas. The only thing I didn't like was the waiter took a long time to get us checked out."}
{"text":"We loved the old location, but it seems the vibe and the decent food have not made the move with the rest of the business. We stopped here for brunch on a holiday Monday, and it was pretty lackluster. The food wasn't too bad, but chintzy portions and funny tasting sausages took away from our meals. My friend's mac n cheese was better, the salad on the side was a bit limp and sad.   The servers seemed to be doing their best but struggling to manage the brunch crowd. It took a while to get our order in. There are only tall bar-stool style chairs and tables, which is never that comfortable. Probably won't go back, given the choice."}
{"text":"I havent written a review in some time but yesterday's dinner experience was below mediocre.   A beautiful sunny day and lots of spots on the patio at 6 pm so we decided to eat at their new location.   I had the Victory salad with the add-on of Flat Iron Steak. And my partner had one of the pizzas with bacon and sausage.   One word for both meals - disappointing.   Mine was especially bad as there was grit in the salad and I couldn't tell if it was because they did not wash the salad (Bibb lettuce and froissé) or from wind blowing dirt into my food. I think it was unwashed spring mix with brown lettuce pieces.   I would not ate their again.   I would only go their for their beer selection..... drinks only."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have pretty much visited every restaurant in the Bloor/Bathurst/Annex area. This place is a great addition. The pizza was excellent, amazing flavour - we weren't really sure what to expect walking in and we instantly agreed mid slice - we are coming back here. Our waiter was great, super friendly and knowledgeable. Deducting one star because of a few \"opening period\" growing pains I think they'll get past. Service was a little slow at first and we didn't have cutlery/napkins when we were eating. For some people that's a rookie deal breaker but the quality of the pizza was fantastic and this is something that will come in time for these guys. Excellent beer selection and nice chill at atmosphere."}
