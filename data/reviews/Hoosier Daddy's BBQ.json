{"text":"Nice place!  Got three mini BBQ sliders (one chicken, beef and pork) with pickles and peppers, one side salad, baked beans and fresh iced tea, all for $8.00!!!   I will go back if I'm in the area.   P.S The guys at the front are really nice too :)"}
{"text":"I can only review on the basis of one BBQ beef sandwich, but it was a great one. The guy who took my order is in fact a \"Hoosier\" from Indiana, and since I'm from Ohio, we got to chat about being immigrants here. The food is the sort of thing I'd find at little drive-in ice cream places off the highways back home, with meat that's been simmering in crock pots for ages. My sandwich had a great balance of spicy and sweet for me, and the roll did its job soaking up all the goodness.  There are fancier BBQ places in town that like being faux-rustic and sell you tiny portions of comfort food for $10 or more each - good for them, but that's not this place. This place is fast food at fast food prices, but something different and with bigger portions than the usual. The \"tenderloin\" pork cutlet sandwich - which is an Indiana thing - has been recommended to me, and I will probably go for that next, along with the desserts. But for now I can tell you this is a place well worth seeking out, especially if you're tired of the same chains and Asian places for lunch."}

{"text":"This is a fast-food barbecue joint in the Cumberland Terrace food court, which is slated to be redeveloped into condos, so it probably won't be in this location forever. I'd imagine that it will relocate within the area though as this looks to be a new chain that will add multiple locations (there is already a planned location at Village by the Grange).  For a food court establishment, BBQ sandwiches are a bit of a different concept. The combos come with two sides and a fountain drink. I had the large pulled pork sandwich with potato and pasta salad and they even threw in a free slice of pie for $9 all in.  The pulled pork is quite good -- I really like the sauce used -- and everything else is pretty mediocre. You can get better pulled pork in any number of pubs or places like the Black Camel, but I'm judging this as a food court experience."}
{"text":"This place is in the Grange foodcourt.   It can be accessed from St. Patrick Street (near the Police division) or McCaul Street (near the OCAD/AGO).  It has an enthusiastic staff and low prices with a large amount of food for your dollars.  I went for supper.   They had combinations on special that really kept the prices down.  I've tried both the pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches.   The quality was good.   I'm glad I said yes to the pickles and peppers, it adds a nice pop to the sandwich.  When I go next I will order apple pie rather than the pecan pie, which I found was a bit  uninspired.   This place would get 5 stars if they had whole wheat buns, fresher desserts, and beans that are spicy/savoury instead of sweet.  Great value for the money makes this a place to go to."}
