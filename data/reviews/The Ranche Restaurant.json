{"text":"So called the 'Ranche' because it's an old converted ranch house built in  1896. It's located at the end of Bow Bottom Trail, inside of Fish Creek park. When I approached the house itself, it was beautifully lit up, with the trees surrounding it, and it reminded me of something out of a Christmas card. We entered the reception room and the staff took our coats, and asked us if we would like to order drinks while we waited. We were a large group for a Christmas party, and they managed to make sure we were seated on time.  We started off with the Charcuterie Board, with had things such as salmon, wild boar pate and deer sausage. I felt like some of the meats were indistinguishable from each other, and we had to ask the server which was which. This appetizer was enough for 4 people to share. After, I had the Lobster Chowder, which was creamy, without being heavy, and had a sweet taste to it. For the main meal I went with the Angus Strip loin. I couldn't tell the difference between this, and a steak from the Keg, the latter having a much better price for their entrees. All in all, I thought this was decent food at a price point which was too high. My only other complaint is that the place can get noisy. I have heard that brunch at the Ranche is a completely different experience, so i would go back to try it, and for the beautiful view."}
{"text":"Been there several times. Everything about it is first rate. Make sure you sit on the patio if the weather is decent. It's awesome"}
{"text":"Great restaurant located in Fish Creek Provincial Park. Service is exceptional with just the right amount of attention. We had the Northern Caribou, cooked to perfection. Wine list is varied with a range from mid to higher priced wines. The character of the restaurant is exquisite and you feel \"tucked away\" from the rush of the city. Easy to book reservations if you are using the open table app on ipad or iphone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So good. Great people who are all passionate about the menu.  A always order the charcuterie board.  The best one I have ever had."}
{"text":"We went here for my mothers birthday on sunday. 11 of us. Great ambiance, but terrible food. 9 items on the menu. Which is fine, so perhaps one or two would be bad. We ordered 5 between us, and all were terrible. Gnocchi was the worst. No taste. Dry, poor texture. (perhaps a lesson from Mercato would help) The steaks had a bacon vinaigrette of some sort. (we dont eat pork) So instead of the chef substituting something else, he just left it out. There were 5 orders of this particular dish, so he could have easily made something to compliment the dry steak.I didnt think anyone could mess up a steak. Hardly any accompaniments. except three corn battered onion rings which were horrible. Avoid this restaurant. An excellent place to just visit and walk around."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there for our anniversary. Its a truly a beautiful place. The warm and cozy interior and surrounding nature outside makes for a wonderful ambiance.  The food was great and the service was excellent. The staff hold themselves to a high standard, and do a great job at meeting those standards. While it is a bit pricey, DH and I have decided to make this our Anniversary \"spot\"."}
{"text":"Close to a 5 star but the price point is a tad too high in my opinion.  The venue is amazing and I can't believe I grew up here and never heard of this place until tonight.  14 of us went for my buddys bday and we got our own private room (probably a good thing cuz we were pretty rowdy) The salmon/scallop cakes were my favorite appy and all the entrees were pretty tasty....especially the wild boar and tuna.  I might come back again if the right occasion arrives but overall I think the prices would keep me away ($18 for 2 crabcakes, $36 for 10oz piece of boar and a few $10 caesars can really add up)"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, outstanding service and delicious food!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for my wife's birthday, and we had a wonderful evening and meal. Our server was excellent, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu changes quite frequently with the seasons so the chef can use local and fresh produce service. One of the specials was PEI mussels and I was taken back by the quantity, price and quality of the dish that I got. Another special that I I could not resist ordering was their bean and truffle oil soup which was so delicious. The spectacular caribou medallions finished my dinner feast. My wife loved their gnocchi and the caramel chocolate hazel nut birthday cake they made for her to take home."}
{"text":"It is located in a very beautiful park and the food was really good as well.  The service was a bit slow, but it was worth the wait. We had a walk around the premises afterwards which was quite lovely."}
{"text":"After a day of biking around Fish Creek Park, my boyfriend and I ended up by The Ranche. A friend had her wedding there, and I assumed it was too upscale and pricy for me to afford on a whim. But the cozy, historic  house, surrounded by a field and trees, didn't look too unassuming, and soon weI had reservations for dinner at 5, muddy shoes and all.  We managed to clean off some of the mud before we got through the door and were given a nice table by the window. After an appy of tomato and burrata (which appeared as coloured discs on the plate, red, white, and green, tomato, cheese, and green tomato, with pesto underneath, and was one of the best things I've ever had), we dug into our mains. I had the salmon and boyfriend had the caribou (specified as 57 degrees Celsius caribou, which is of course the only temperature I eat my wild game). Both were very good. The salmon was cooked just right, not too dry, and the tomato broth, and the chorizo sausage complimented the buttery flavour of the salmon well. I've never actually had caribou before, so from what I tried of my boyfriend's dish, it was an interesting taste.  Ok but guys, then there was dessert. Roasted Strawberry tart with house made dark chocolate ice cream, and a berry mouse with lime drizzle. It was all good, but if I could have smuggled a bucket of the house made dark chocolate from the kitchen, I totally would have. I agree with other reviews that it's not cheap to eat here, but I think that for the portions and dining experience, plus the high quality of the food, it's worth it.  Treat yo self!"}
{"text":"A good place for corporate events - and that's about it.  Menu is professional-grade, but personally I didn't enjoy whatever I tried... how to explain that... an alright stuff, but nothing to remember or tell friends \"you should definitely try that\"?  Service is clearly shaped for working with big parties, I can't imagine dropping in there on my own, would feel almost like I popped at the other company party by mistake.  The location is nice though, (not sure how it looks like now after all the flooding in the area), and can work just fine for a corporate eating-out celebration."}
