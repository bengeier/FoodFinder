{"text":"Headed here after a night at the movies after spotting it on the drive by.

The prices are pretty standard for an asian dessert place, so when the total came to more than $30 it wasn't much of a surprise.
Ordered the Matcha Sago with Red Bean and Mochi (~$6.45), Black Glutinous Rice with Mochi, Mango, and Coconut Milk (~$6.45), Mango Sago with Coconut Jelly and Mango (~$5.45), Mango Slush (~$5), Curry Fish/Beef Balls- 6 pcs (~$5), and Glutinous Rice Balls with Peanut and Syrup- 5 or 6 pcs (~$3.45).

The taste overall for each of these items wasn't bad; was pretty good and not too the sweet. The matcha sago was a little bland, but oh well just won't order it next time. The mochi could have been a little better, because with these desserts I was expecting the boiled kind of mochi but they use the mochi you find at the toppings bar at frozen yogurt self-serve places. A little disappointed about that, but will also know to not order stuff with mochi in it next time.

But the problem with each of them (minus the fish balls and the rice balls with peanut of course) was that they WEREN'T COLD ENOUGH. They were honestly only a little under room temperature, and that made them a lot less enjoyable than they could have been.

But other than that, not bad at all! They don't seat many people but I go a seat right away on a weeknight. May come back again."}
{"text":"Good place to eat lunch, all asian style foods, specially the \"Japanese Style Curry Chicken With Rice\",  taste delicious and quiet place for eating chinese desserts at night time, I like the \"Half Of Slices Mango Sago Mixed\", love it so much, will definitly order it again, open 7 days a week, mon to thu 11am to midnight, fri 11am to 2am, sat 6pm to 2am, sun 6pm to midnight, for sure you guys will get times to come and try all the good stuffs in here!!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with girlfriend. Very quiet, cozy place and in the heart of Markham (close to soon-to-be Downtown Markham). Friendly and generous staff and family owned. Waiter does very hard to satisfy all your needs. The rice dishes are very delicious and portions is good for the price. During the grand opening, add $2.95 with the purchase of food can get you a mango slush. The slush is much better than ones sold at Pmall. Will definitely come here again and spread for the word out to friends. Even from friend's mouth, the mango desserts at \"Sweet Dessert House\" is an ABSOLUTELY MUST GET! The place is small so don't recommend large groups as its only got about 20 seats. 

Quality of food and dessert -  5/5
Service - 5/5
Location - 5/5
Environment - 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I thought this place was a lot better than it looked. It is a small place and can fill up on weekends. I have gone both on a weekend and weekday so i have compared. The reason was because they only offered tofu pudding on weekends. 

Honestly, I don't remember the name of the desserts I ordered, but i will definitely describe them. Don't worry, I didn't eat them all myself. You may notice I enjoy green tea and mango in different ways :) 

1. mango sago with grass jelly, pomelo and diced mango
2. green tea ice cream with mochi,jelly and red bean on the side 
3. green tea slush with tofu pudding and red bean
4. purple/black glutinous rice with coconut milk, mango and mochi. 

All of them were good and serving size was great for the price! THOUGH, one thing that will trip you out is that 3 and 4 were hot and cold, respectively. We thought it would have been the other way around. 3 could have also been a little more sweet. Regardless, we would come again, but remember to ask if the dessert is hot or cold. 

As for items on the menu, they have a lot of variety, BUT many options are blacked out,
Go check them out if you want some chinese dessert."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall type of dessert house. It is located in a business park and you don't really see it unless you are driving south on birchmount.

Every time i have come here, it's been really busy. 

my family and I always opt for a mango sago, some sweet soup (almond or sesame) with rice balls and the durian puff. 

Everything is great but when you order items that people rarely order, you can tell it is not fresh. 

I would definitely give this place a try if you're looking for chinese dessert with good value."}
{"text":"Usually, my friends and I love coming here at least once a week. We love the sago and the environment, but this time, the staff was extremely rude to us. We ordered over the phone a mango sago with pomelo and green tea ice cream which was around 7 dollars. They charged us for mango sago with ice cream which was 2 dollars extra, which in total was an extra $2-3. The extra few dollars didn't bother us but their reasoning did. When asked why the exact same thing cost more (keep in mind that this did not have pomelo in it either), the lady could not answer and had to ask the back. The people in the back didn't know either and the chef even yelled that they already made it. Not and SINGLE person was in the restaurant, so it wouldn't have been a hassle to add pomelo to it and charge us for the order we actually wanted. The lady in the front refused to charge us for the cheaper price when I even heard one of the people from the back say to just give it to us. We are REGULAR customers, so good thing for them saving that extra 2 bucks but losing good paying customers."}
{"text":"The location is very small and hidden away but it is the best Asian dessert place I've ever been to and I'm not usually a huge fan of Asian dessert. I love it and I always go and bring friends to try it too. I definitely recommend Sweet House Dessert. Trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Was having pregnancy cravings for late night sweets so called my mom and my aunt to check out this little hidden Chinese dessert joint.
It's very hidden and a small family owned Chinese dessert place in an industrial area, very unexpected. Upon walking in we got a huge whiff of durian! They have a good variety of desserts and drinks that were generous in portion from seeing my neighbouring table order it. I ended up getting a mango, pomelo sago dessert and hubby and mom/aunt got a walnut paste with rice balls. We arrived around 1030 and they were all sold out of the popular tofu custard so that wiped out a portion of the menu that we wanted to try. Also sold out of almond paste... they only opened maybe 2 hours before so we were a little surprised. My mom was disappointed they didn't have her favourite steamed egg/milk custard. I would have given then 4 stars but minused 1 because of these shortfalls.

The portions are good and prices are average, around 5-8 bucks. We spent 26 for 3 desserts and the bill included a 10% tip.
We would return again if we had another dessert craving but might try to go earlier as it seems desserts are limited in quantity and they sell out fast."}
{"text":"Saw this place many times and finally make a stop here. Shop is small but that's fine since there are only 2 people working here. Had their durian pancake which comes with 2pcs, mango sago with lychee jello, and durian purple gluten rice dessert. They are all good and not super sweet. Mango is sweet and soft. Decent size of durian in the pancake and there is cream in it, but maybe ask for less cream if you aren't a fan of eating too much cream. Purple gluten rice with durian is normal, but I just wanted to have durian that night and I always like purple gluten rice dessert, lol. Overall it's a good place for dessert with good price and portion. But not suggest if you are having a big group to the store"}
{"text":"Had to come back to my favourite dessert spot. This time we already had a massive lunch so we weren't so hungry. However, we still had to try the snacks and hot food in addition to full filling out sweets craving. 

Definitely try the baked spaghetti with cheese and bbq pork rice. Not too sweet or salty. Even the rice in tomato sauce was delicious. You also won't go wrong with the mango sago!"}
{"text":"Mango with grass jelly and evaporated milk. So tasty. Mango was super ripe and sweet and there was half a mango. Portions are quite large."}
{"text":"This place is quite pricey for the snack that they offer.  Interestingly, for take out, they add a 25 cents surcharge for each item.  Is that even legal as I have not heard of this anywhere else. The menu gas several items increase in prices, but it was not reflected on the take out menu.   I don't know, but I sure don't feel very good about this arrangement.  For this alone, I would not come back to this place because it was not really advised to me during the ordering process. 

))updated after tasting food((
The food ends up being quite good, but incorrect pricing on the menu is totally unacceptable.  Even on the take-out menu, the chicken wings was listed as $6.49, and two orders should be $12.98.  But instead, I got charge $16.48.  Can you do the math as to why?  Wouldn't it be just $12.98.  I was like, \"what is going on here?\"  I was doubting my math skill for a split second, but it did not sit right with me, so I asked the server again.

 When I asked the lady to explain, she was not able to explain the pricing at all.  She asked someone from the kitchen to come explain the price to me and she said it cost too much to re-print the take-out menu, and she showed me the in-house me for the restaurant which listed chicken wings as $7.99 per order.  As a result, two order would be $15.98 plus $0.50 for two containers.  

When did a restaurant set up a menu that is a math question for the customers?  I think most customers would over look this, but she was giving me an attitude the entire time while trying to explain it to me.   Sigh~ I did not have the energy to negotiate since I worked almost 12 hours by that time and my shift had not ended at my work place.  I just would say I am disappointed with this place.  

No matter how good the food tasted, I would not be able to come back to this place with the expectation pricing might be incorrect again.  
 
All two stars are for the food only since I did not have a good customer service experience.

If you want to try out this place, make sure you ask about their current pricing before ordering anything."}
{"text":"Not that great ordered popcorn chicken and fried porkchop with rice.. 

Overpriced and took them 30minutes to bring the food.. when it wasn't even busy...not to mention they gave our popcorn chicken to the wrong table and brought it back.

Also half the menu stuff are not even available anymore !

Anyway i will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I had no problem getting a table when I arrived on a weekend since it was still early in the night but when I left there were people waiting for a table. Unfortunately the desserts that I liked the most had price increases compared to the last time I went such as the mango and durian pancakes. The previous prices were covered up with a label in the menu. This dessert place is pretty small; it only has room to seat around 26 people so can get pretty busy at night.

I had trouble flagging down the waitress as she was the only person there taking orders and serving food to tables. A lot of times she disappeared in the kitchen so I would rate customer service as 2/5. 

The mango pancake's skin was soft on top, but on the bottom it was too thick and a little hard to eat. Besides that I liked the large chunk of mango inside. I also had the almond tea sweet soup+tofu pudding which is not too sweet and is a good portion size to share. The tofu was really soft. Overall I will be back next time and would go earlier to avoid lineups!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Sweet House Dessert. It's awesome that it's close to the VIP Cineplex in downtown Markham. I am rating it a 4 because I felt that although it took awhile for them to make the dessert and it's not my favorite in terms of taste, it felt fresh and the lady who served us was nice and welcoming. I ordered purple rice (or black glutinous) with peanut rice balls (comes in 3). The sesame balls are tastier so you should opt for that next time. Did not like the durian pancake scent wafting in the air but it's a must go if you're a durian lover. They have a whole page of desserts devoted to durian. A cozy dessert place to try out - or to even bring your young kids for dinner to, like a dad did on our visit. They serve up BBQ pork and egg on rice or some noodles, even a baked minced meat on spaghetti which is what I'll go for next time!"}
{"text":"Sweet house? More like full house as soon as we went in! They have about 25 seats and they're usual always packed. Service is also relatively slow considering they're a small family run business (1-2 in the kitchen and another as the server). 

Aside from the service and environment, the food here is pretty good. My classic favourite is their durian mango sago and mango sago with coconut jelly. If you love durian, this has to be one of the best dessert place for durian. They also have your traditional Chinese desserts here as well!"}
{"text":"This a small place in a random location but the food, dessert, and drinks are delicious! I always get the mango coconut sago drink...yum! I also would recommend going during the quieter times as it can get busy. Two times I went, I made sure to arrive before dessert time (before 7:30) as after we put our order in, there was always two large groups who would walk in and take up the rest of the restaurant."}

The sweet house dessert is a very small restaurant that is in the middle of a industrial plaza. There's literally nothing open around it during the night time. However, it doens't take away the effort they put into their dishes.

I would like to say first that their service is really good. They were very accommodating to ours needs such as holding tables for more potential people and only asked for the space when the place was starting to fill up. The menu was straight forward and had lots of pictures showing us all the possible yummy desserts.

The best part is how true those pictures are to the actual dish. Our first order was black glutinous rice with mango, mochi, coconut milk, and tapioca. The mochi was so soft and chewy, that it makes the mochi at Yogurty's mochi seem stale. The glutinous rice was sweet and full of red bean flavour without the sandiness as expected. Overall a very well done dish.

The second dish was sago, coconut jelly, with durian ice cream. All staple flavours in my opinion put together, except the durian(my fav). A fair warning though, this dish is full of sweet flavours in every bite. My kind of chinese dessert. Best part was the portion size! Most places skimp out and give you a small chinese bowl. This place gives you a normal size bowl.

Looking for a late night chinese dessert place? Look here! Very foreign friendly."}
{"text":"Nice dessert place if you like Chinese milk shakes and sweet soups. Desserts with durian or mango are served here, too."}
{"text":"After dinner around Downtown Markham, my friends and I have a craving for something sweet. I recalled there was a \"sweet soup\" place around, and we decided to come here. Came here around 9ish and the lot isn't too packed. Once we got in, the place is small with about a dozen tables that are all filled with people. Luckily a group was leaving, so we were seated not too long after. 

We looked up the menu with their many choices. I decided on getting the purple rice with sweet rice ball (with black sesame filling) sweet soup. I am a sucker for the purple rice sweet soup dessert. Wherever I go, that's my go to thing no matter what. My friends also made their choices. Not long after our desserts came out. And of course I dived right in. The sweet soup wasn't too sweet, and the black sesame gluttonous rice balls were just right with texture and flavour (again, not too sweet). Traditionally, sweet soups came out too hot. However the temperature was just right. Kudos to the chef. Overall, I like the dessert. 

Only drawback/comment I have is... the place is too cramped? But good places like this \"mom and pop\" store will always be tiny. They don't win me with their decor or how nice the seats are. Rather they win the customers over with their food and service. Will I come back? Yes I will."}
{"text":"Passed by this hidden gem accidentally and so glad I did. The first thing i said was \"do you smell that? Smells like heaven\" but ofc to my friend it reeked...reeked of DURIAN,

DURIAN LOVERS. THIS. IS. THE. PLACE.

They have traditional chinese desserts but i cannot stress enough that they have durian desserts! durian pancakes, shakes and other goodness!

This dessert house is mom and pop owned so don't expect anything fancy, it's small and is short staffed.

The prices are good as well!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with my friends at 9:00pm. Walking into the shop, i could smell faint durian smell from their durian desserts. I decided to get number 111 on the menu was matcha green tea ice cream with jelly, mochi, mango and red bean. It was a delicious combo and was extremely large for roughly $6.50. 

Unfortunately, the space is tight and the waitress kindly asked us at 11pm to leave because the table is booked by another customer.

Would come here again!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars based on the quality of our take out dessert. Came here on a whim after reading some positive Yelp reviews. It was packed on the Saturday night that we went there. The cafe is fairly small and gets pretty packed on weekends as it probably seats only about 24 people. After realizing that our party of 5 were not likely to be seated within 20-30 minutes, we opted to take out some dessert. 

The menu includes a lot of refreshing Asian desserts such as mango or durian pancake, tofu based desserts, and mixed desserts containing mango, +/- durian, with sago, coconut jelly, grass jelly, and pomelo bits. Although we didn't try it, we noticed some people had ordered hot food items such as Japanese curry, noodles, and other meal items. Something to try for next time. 

We ordered the 3 orders of #71: mango sago with coconut jelly. Each order came to $7.57 including tax. The size of each serving was quite generous, about 300 mL, and included a decent amount of coconut jelly and cubes of fresh mango in a blended mango/sago base. Very refreshing and not too sweet, just the way I prefer mango desserts to taste. Next time I plan to try their mango pancake (looks more like a crepe) or the mango/grass jelly/pomelo dessert.

 Apparently there is another location at the Peachtree plaza near Hwy 7 & Kennedy. We were told that that location has extended hours on weekends from 12pm to 8pm but it has much more limited seating. 

I have often passed by Sweet House Dessert while heading south on Birchmount but it looked so out of place in what essentially seems like an industrial area that I wouldn't have thought to stop in. However it is one of those hole in the wall types of restaurants that seems to get repeat customers from the uniqueness and quality of their food. My tastebuds were intrigued by the limited dessert experienced and I plan to go back another time, perhaps closer to their 7pm opening time to improve our chances of dining in.

(16/100)"}
{"text":"The best purple rice mango soup ever! Can't find other stores that sell anything like it. The mango pancake is another all time favourite for me! Just the right amount of mangos n cream just wrapped around.

The durian smoothie apparently was amazing according to my friend cause the durian smoothie had so much flavour over just having ice or milk"}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this already but I guess not so here we go. My best friend took me here last year and I was surprised to find this so finely tucked away in a dark area. Because of this, there's never many customers here so I hope that this place is doing well enough to survive and surprisingly it is. 

I liked it a lot more back then than now- the prices were a lot more reasonable and the portions a lot larger. The durian desserts are mouth watering especially for a durian craving girl like myself. The durian pancake is one of the best- the pancake itself is super soft and it's like eating a tiny pillow. The durian is soft and flavourful, which is heaven in my mouth. As I said, the pancake used to be $7-8 and now it's $10.95, which is a bit ridiculous. I think my jaw may have dropped when I saw that. It seems like all the durian dessert prices have skyrocketed and $10 for a small bowl of sago is not worth it. 

The people that work here are very nice and always present their service with a smile. The desserts come fairly quick and although they're always watching the chinese channel, they're quick to respond to you. 

I'd love to come back here because the desserts are oh so good, but dude... increasing prices by that much makes me want to pass out..."}
{"text":"I dont get how two desserts (durian pomelo sago & red bean tofu pudding) can take over 40 mins. It's pretty ridiculous, esp when they can be made beforehand. They weren't worth the wait either; just average."}
{"text":"Went there again as I haven't been back there in ages... In the end, waited for 45 minutes for the desserts! I guess I went during the most busiest time at 9pm?? But the desserts that were ordered were so simple....does not justify such long wait for things like mango with sago and ice cream.  Never again..they also messed up my order and had to redo it, after I pointed out mine came with ice cream. They simply apologized but nothing was rectified on the bill to make up for the messed up order or the long wait..

Verdict: Go there if u have time to kill or if u are not that hungry yet or can wait 45 minutes (at least). Or go to their Kennedy location..so much faster.  I knew I should have went to Tracy desserts instead..my gut was telling me to go there..."}
{"text":"This is quite the hidden joint in an industrial complex just north of Birchmount and 14th avenue..
Opened for about a year, this is a small mom and daughter place that's serving some traditional Chinese desserts and a few warm bites in small unit. 
Keep in mind this place is only opened from 7pm onwards to midnight.

For desserts I ordered shaven ice with ice cream and red bean. Presented in a glass, with lots of fun filled chilled goodness. 

Jen had warm sago with taro and coconut milk, served in a bowl, it was a nice warm comforting choice. 

Overall a great local place that's serving traditional desserts, reasonable and in a clean environment.

Great job!"}
{"text":"I totally have to agree with the yelpers down here who's written about long wait times. Its very true. The place is quite small and there's only one worker. 

I'm usually a really nice reviewer but today, I'm just going to be blunt and honest. 

I ordered the black glutinous rice with mango and coconut milk with tapioca. What came to the table was all of the above except for the tapioca. I waved him down and he said we haven't done tapioca in a while. Well I'm sorry but it was on your menu and you could have at least told me when I ordered it. It is really frustrating when you didn't tell me in the first place AND you didn't even try to ask if I wanted something else because I didn't like what I received. So not only is the foods wrong, the customer service wasn't great. 

The dessert wasn't bad and that's why they deserve these 2 stars. I'm not sure if I'd come back again.... Maybe just for the dessert I'll get take out. But I risk them giving me the wrong dessert without them telling me again?!"}
{"text":"A typical Chinese dessert place. The price is good for the portion. My go-to order is #98; mango sago with grass jelly and pomelo. The only down side I have is they don't serve much bubble tea and the hot desserts come in a smaller size."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Let's start of with the good stuff. The desserts here are amazing. Very consistent and also very traditional. It's definitely a great place to grab a dessert.

But the downside is that there is always a super long wait. And they serve desserts at separate times so each time I have visited, half or all of the rest of my party would be done their desserts and one person is still waiting on theirs. They really need to manage their timing and perhaps it would help if they hired another staff.

My main problem is that when they run out of certain components for their dishes, they won't notify you. They will just do a substitution. This is not acceptable because first off, Ofcourse this is not what the first wants or expects. It's always worse when you don't let them know. That one feature could have been the whole reason they ordered the dish in the first place. And secondly, what if the patron is allergic to that new substitution? 

So food is great, but they have quite a lot else to work on. I can appreciate that it's a small business, but minor changes can make a huge difference."}
{"text":"This place is definitely  not an easy place to come by. There's no way you would find it by just driving by. Ordered 4 things, all decently priced but the flavour was good (but a lot of cheap ingredients used like their coconut jelly and mochi). Their mango pomelo sago was delicious though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night all excited but quite disappointed. The only dish worth talking about was the durian mango sago. Definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"Grass jelly with mango pomelo & sago- Totally recommend this dessert! The mangoes were sooo sweet and delish ! Overall, all the elements of the dessert worked well together and had a perfect amount of sweetness ! 

Also, they have a T.V.! They play STRANGE Mandarin movies ( with English subtitles) but interesting enough for you to get sucked into watching it! ^^

I'll definitely come back and try other desserts!"}
{"text":"Ordered way too much stuff here for two people and sadly not one dish met our expectations. Its not that the desserts tasted bad but it each dish was lacking something.

Black glutinous rice with mango, mochi and coconut milk $5.95 - the was probably the best dessert we had out of everything. The mango's were fresh but just thought it was lacking in sweetness. 

Matcha with read bean and tofu pudding $5.95 - I'm pretty sure this dessert is suppose to be served cold but it was like a drink that was left out and warmed to room temperature. Once again we thought it lacked in sweetness.

Durian and grass jelly in vanilla sauce $8.65 - I saw the picture that Jennifer K. posted of this dessert and it looked amazing. I even show the picture to the waitress and said I wanted this exact picture. What I get though was a little different. I got the durian which was really fresh by the way and I did get grass jelly but the vanilla sauce was just a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It tasted okay but it just wasn't what I was expecting. 

Mango pancake $7.95 - the dish looked very appealing but what this dish really consisted of is a thin rubbery orange wrap the mimic the look of mango and on the inside its cool whip cream and a mango. The mango was really fresh once again. It was really messy eating this as the whipped cream would just get every where when you cut it open. I loved eating the fresh mango but that was about all I enjoyed with this dessert.

Popcorn chicken $5.70 - tasted good but nothing special to point out. Its popcorn chicken so its hard to get this wrong.

The place is really small and felt as though I was visiting my grandparents or something because they had Chinese drama on TV. Service was excellent.

I know this place deserves higher rating because I could taste how fresh everything was but I just did not enjoy the desserts here. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items. I also find the prices a bit high here for some items."}
{"text":"To be fair, I made two visits. Once on a weekend and once on a weekday, both times at night.

The place is small, coworker seems nice but she is very pushy, and quality is below average.

The curry fish/beef balls seemed like they were just microwaved warm, and curry was just poured on top. Er, that's not curry fish/beef balls? The place up at Pacific Mall makes them waaayyyy better.

The desserts were nothing special. And they are pretty slow.

I was most disappointed to see what was in their fridge was mostly store bought items like packaged glutinous rice balls (tang yuan - ??) and cool whip. Why am I eating here when I get them at T&T and make them myself? 

Also, they will kick you out once you are done eating. The lady will push you the bill then tell you they have 'reservations'. Just rude and disrespectful. For all of the above, I will not come back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 9ish with two others. Place was full and we were told that we'd have to wait for around 20 minutes for a table. Got seated in about 10 minutes.

The smell of durian was strong in the enclosed space. Definitely not a big fan of it, but durian lovers would be happy.

Small dessert place with minimal tables and servers (only one actually - I believe she's the owner). Other than that, the desserts are quite delicious and the customer service is excellent. 

Interior and exterior wise, not so great. Place is too small and it's pretty much in the middle of an industrial area.

Overall, I'd go back for the desserts."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and kind of hard to find! So I've only been here twice. First time was couple months ago and second time being yesterday. The service is quite friendly although the speak Cantonese and I'm not sure if they speak English... Their menu has English in it and you write down your orders so it should be ok if you don't speak Cantonese. The menu has a decent variety of desserts. One popular one being durian pancakes.. yuck! I am definitely NOT a fan of durian. It's also pricy for durians man! $10 for the dessert! I get the mango desserts and they are quite nice! They also offer lots of sago desserts  and snacks for a decent price. The place is tiny so be careful.  I don't come here enough to know which days are packed. Not a bad place haha will probably come back again!"}
{"text":"Chinese dessert place in a odd neighborhood, seems to be a mom and pop place that has about 8 tables, very limited seating, lots of Chinese dessert variety, ordered the green tea w red bean and tofu pudding, flavors did not blend well for me, the mango sago was decent, also got the black sesame paste, it was okay

Beware they automatically charge a 10% gratitude on top of your bill without letting me know, it was good my girlfriend caught because I was going to pay tips on top of the bill"}
{"text":"I was feeling adventurous one day so decided to try durian for the first time! The place is kind of hidden so it's really easy for people to drive past it on Birchmount without knowing it exists. It is close to the overpass near the VIP theatres. Considering how hidden it is I was surprised the moment I got there that there was already a line up. The wait time for us was about 20-30 minutes. A very small place with small wooden chairs and tables. Due to the small space the tables are aligned very close to each other as well.

I decided to keep my order durian themed so I ordered the Durian pancake and Durian Pomelo and Sago Sweet Soup. The Durian Pancake was actually quite interesting. The durian pancake was baaically a piece of durian wrapped with a crepe and stuffed with some cream.

The pancake was very fresh and cool (kind of like mochi). I Ioved the soft chewiness of it. It is a nice way to try durian because the cream helps neutralize the durian taste and the sweetness of the pancake makes it good. So even if you are not the biggest durian fan or lover the dessert is still okay and enjoyable. If you are a durian fan the dessert would be perfect because they really give you generous portions of durian and overall it tasted pretty good.

They give generous amounts of Durian for the pomelo and sago sweet soup as well. I liked this one because it was like drinking mango soup with sago in it and the durian flavour wasn' quite overpowering despite the fact that they give you the whole chunk.

All in all it was an interesting experience and I would come back to try more items :)"}
{"text":"It is a very small restaurant, mostly they serve dessert, they also have some snack n noodles to choose from. The staff here are friendly maybe because the tips are already included. Food taste right and for sure will come back."}
{"text":"A total gem for the Chinese desserts, especially if you like durian - which you get a whiff of as soon as you walk in. I got the mango sago with green tea ice cream, heavenly!! It's tucked away in a small plaza but quite busy given I went there on a weeknight. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Haven't Tried this place so I figured it why not. First of all it is a nice hidden corner of Markham, so there is lots of parking even at odd hours. Small area so it can't hold that much people. It does get busy near the end of the night. I ordered Mango sago with pieces of mango and grass jelly with pomelo and also had the sweet ginger soup with rice balls. Both equally good. We had a quiet setting so it wasn't too bad. Will for sure try again."}
{"text":"I've looked for a mango sago place for quite a while now missing home and my childhood sweets. This place hit it right on the mark. It's really tiny , like a hole in the wall and the choices aren't a lot but it's nice the way it is. free wifi! And the popcorn chicken is really good ! Yup is a must for them . I didn't like the dessert bun though too much cream for my hips ."}
{"text":"Went back again and got the mango sago with mango and lychee jelly $6 .... Smaller than the grass jelly series sooo for that reason I'd get the grass jelly combo haha

Quick service. Guy who's there owns the place and he's super friendly. 

The mango sago with mango fruit shake was delicious! $5

Still one of the more affordable Asian desserts. And they have mango during off season! Sick."}
{"text":"Its one of the closer options for chinese dessert if youre in the downtown markham area. But... seriously, every time i come here, they run out of the stuff i order; they dont even tell me until at least 10 min later. And its not even like i come at 12 am where everything is sold out. Also, for what offer, the prices arent that well balanced. Youre better off going to the ones on hwy 7 or at MK Plaza where not only do they offer similar if not same quality of food for practially what theyre charging here, but they also have more experience in serving customers.

Parking is also very limited, which is the same with their seating. I did notice however that they have a take out? shop at MK Plaza, if you guys ever want to check that out first.

Onto their quality of food. Not the best; borderline pass for me. Lot of their stuff tasted watered down... which is a big no no when it comes to chinese desserts. Some of their sweet soups were so runny i started to wonder if i was paying for water. Even though they have a pretty big menu, what does it matter when you dont even have half the stuff half the time??"}
{"text":"A solid 2.5 stars rounded to a three!

Food: Ahh traditional chinese desserts. In my opinion, it was pretty good but not anything extraordinary. Did have to wait about 20 mins though for food to arrive. 

Service: The lady was polite despite being the only one on floor running around. 

Decor: Reaaally small space located in the middle of nowhere so try to avoid coming in a large group to avoid the wait. Packed on a tuesday evening. Could really benefit from upgrading to a larger space."}
{"text":"This place is only opened from 7pm - 1am. We arrived here at around 12:10am and it was packed. Yes the place is small, but you don't need a large space for a dessert place. I enjoyed the sesame paste a lot because I could really taste the sesame. Really brought back my childhood memories. The mango with purple Glutinous rice was served cold, and I was taken a shot since I thought it was hot. I wouldn't have ordered that on such a cold rainy night in Toronto. I could imagine having it during a hot summer, but does it even get hot in Toronto?? The purple yam & black sesame rice balls were only okay. The syrup that it was served in was too sweet to my liking. I'm not really into sweet things."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful dessert restaurant with many options to choose from; either traditional desserts or ones with a more modern twist. Weekend evenings are probably the busiest for them though weeknights after dinner can get busy as well. It is a family business and run efficiently. I've had their sago items, both kinds of \"pancakes\", and their durian milkshake.

The sago items are refreshing. The mango one in particular is really good. They actually take the time to ripen the mangoes when they're not in season so they are definitely focused on getting the quality right. There's nothing like mango sago during the winter. The green tea sago with red bean is all right, I find the mochi topping is a bit tough. 

The pancakes are by far the best among the GTA region dessert places. Other establishments will either give you less fruit or less whipped cream/cool whip, or the crepe skin is too thick, but Sweet House nails it every single time. The pancakes are literally bursting with cream and you get a generous portion of fruit. Again, they make sure their mangoes are ripe before serving and if you're not sure, just ask. They are more than willing to tell you whether the mangoes are ripe enough for service or not. 

Lastly, the durian milkshake is incredible. It is a rich durian flavour with small chunks of durian left in the milkshake for you to chew on. I've tried quite a few, including the one at Golden Turtle downtown, and this one is by far the best. If you love durian, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A true hole-in-the-wall dessert shop (I sat next to a makeshift \"wall\" which was actually the back of their kitchen fridge with a sheet over it no-joke).

You walk in, in stinks or it smells wonderful. Why? Because it's the smell of Durian fruit. 
Over 50% of their main dessert menu contains Durian. Lots of combinations between mango, Durian, and herbal grass jelly.

I ordered a mango, Pomelo, grass jelly, sago mix bowl, and I ate the whole thing despite not having a huge sweet tooth for Chinese desserts. It was great, the perfect portion and the ripest mango.

The best part about this shop is it's open late (Midnight), and you don't need to spend more than $10-12/per person."}

What should I order?

I was overwhelmed by all the choices here at Sweet House Dessert!

342 items of ice, pudding, slush and snacks to choose from in a small dessert place that has a capacity around 15 customers. 

After studying the menu for awhile, we decided on:

#78 Matcha Sago wi/Red Bean & Mochi ($5.95) - great texture contrast of all the element. A little taste of bitter from matcha and a little sweetness from red bean.

#21 Durian Grass Jelly in Vanilla Sauce ($7.95) - When I saw the girl took out a fresh durian from the fridge, I knew I would like it. That huge ball of durian flesh was the star of the show.....

So now 2 down, another 340 item to chose from the next time I am here!

Sweet Home Dessert has this sweet homey family vibe. Price point might be a little higher than other places. Yes I did spent $8 plus tax and tip on my durian dessert, but it is OK to splurge once in a while, especially for something I enjoy!

BTW, why was my Yelp Friend kept moving further and further away from me?"}
{"text":"Well, it was my first time here. Small place with limited parking spots(not sure if there are more spaces in the back). We were there on a Tuesday at around 11pm or so and it was packed! Moreover, there were 1 person in the front working.

We didn't get our food for probably a good 40 minutes. When she came, we told her we haven't received our food yet. She went to get prepared right away since apparently they had misplaced our order.
She was nice about it, since it was pretty busy and she was on her own running all over the place.

We ordered glutinous rice balls with peanuts, mango sago mixed, and black glutinous rice with mango, mochi and coconut milk. It was good. It would be a full 5 stars if it wasn't for that little incident."}
{"text":"This is your hole-in-the-wall Chinese desserts place. Driving along Birchmount south of 14th ave. you can barely see it being there. The exterior of the building looks like a commercial plaza. Within is a cozy place with I'd say more than 5 but less than 10 tables to sea everyone. It is a very small place. There is an overhanging lcd in the corner showing the latest Asian news tidbits for everyone's entertainment. If say there is about two servers at most at any given time but they run a very tight ship and when I was there one server was running the floor.

The dessert is on point which is why my rating is high. I had the durian pancake and the black sesame dessert. Like I said, both were on point. Friends that ordered fresh fruit desserts weren't disjointed either as the fruits we're fresh and delicious.

All in all the dessert is on point but the place is rather small and would sum it up as your hole in the wall Chinese desserts place!

Parking out front is free and should be plentiful!"}
{"text":"Unacceptable!!!!! We have to wait 20 minutes for 1 dish, they need to hire more people... And they don't have pork or rice when we tried to order the curry pork rice

I think this is their first time to open a restaurant

However, The desserts are great!!!!!"}
