{"text":"Fresh and good food but plater should be $7 not $10ish. You get rice small salad and 1 stick of meat extra stick is $4."}
{"text":"My first experience with Afghan food. Loved it. Fast service and generous portions. I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them a few times and I love their food. The staff is very friendly and they give you great service. I like their rice here better than some other afghan restaurants. Their prices are very reasonable and their food is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Try the chicken tikka and the shami skewer! Home made hot salsa is on the table, and the naan bread was freshly baked to order! I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb shank dinner and kabuki kebob dinner. Lamb shank was cooked very tender and flavourful, nice aroma, super! And we loved the chaplee kebob so much it was with very aromatic and nice special spices. But the kebob was on the dry side, which was not as juicy and tender as we had expected. It actually was our first time trying the Afghanistan cuisine and it was a great experience. By the way, their spicy sauce was fantastic! Must try!"}
{"text":"I would give this Afghan place a 2.5 stars on an overall bases 

First impression when getting in... nice size place with plenty seating arrangements. Take a menu and once decided you will have to order and pay for it at the till and wait for the food. 

Food wise the price is decent but they don't have an extensive menu as some other Afghan restaurants,  so we had their Qabilee Palow, Shami Kabab, Beef Kabab, Chapliee Kabab and Tandoori Chicken. The kababs were very nice and taste but Tandoori chicken wasn't worth the price and wasn't spicy at all to be called Tandoori. They did give us the red chili sauce but they weren't serving the white sauce. 

The service was OK, there was enough seating and Parking. 

They lost the stars because of not providing the white sauce and non of their chain do as I went to one at Rexdale ave in Toronto, same scenario. Their naans were quite small when compared with other similar vendors. They only had one person cleaning tables so the restaurant was a bit messy.


For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat."}
{"text":"This place was huge! Talk about being packed. There is something to be saud about a packed place. The food was fresh, flavorful and the business could not keep the line down. While visiting Toronto we stayed in Mississauga and dined here one evening. The cashier (adorable teen) was very helpful as to what we should order. Despite the chaos, taking phone orders and dealing with the line that did not die down she was professional. The meats were tender, the bread was warm and the food had tons of flavor. This was our first time trying Afghan food, but it will not be our last. Next time we'll dine in for ths full experience!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place...its not very busy and you can sit relax and watch tv as well:) Waitress is friendly and can strike a conversation with them.
This is my 'go to' place when craving kababs. Portions are huge. Prices are same as any other kebab place.
Ambience is nice, clean washrooms and clean seating."}
{"text":"I would give this Afghan place a 3.5 stars on an overall bases but they lost the half star because of not providing the white sauce.

First impression when getting in... small place with some seating arrangements. Take a menu and once decided you will have to order and pay for it at the till and wait for the food. 

Food wise the price looked decent but we were their during lunch so I had their Kabab lunch special. You get 2 kabab with rice, salad and a pop. You can select to have both kabab chicken, beef or one each. You guess it! I went with one each. The kababs were very nice and taste. They did give us the red chili sauce but they weren't serving the white sauce. Even with the take out order I have to ask for the sauce. 

The service fast, there was enough seating and Parking.

For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat."}
{"text":"I sometimes go here if I am at Canada computers (next door) and feeling hungry. This is an afghan eatery, meaning it's similar to Arabic or Persia food, but different.  The lack of humas is my biggest peve. Otherwise the portions are large and the food is good. I usually get a spicy double chicken kabob dinner. It comes with rice, salad, and a big piece of bread. With a drink and taxes it's less than 15$, and unless your a big eater like myself, one portion is enough for two people. The place also got renovated recently, which is badly needed.  Overall, 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"The food is alright. I didn't really enjoy the meat or the sauce used. The quantity is more than enough for the price.

The service was good and quick. They are not very busy, so there isn't a long wait for anything.

Don't live near here, so I will not likely return. Either way, I think it's a so-so place."}
{"text":"It's honestly hard to put everything I feel when I walk into here. Firstly the for, fantastic, I always get two Chaplee pieces and two naan, and never disappoint. The naan, fresh tasty, fluffy it's just perfect. 

The staff, just amazing but there's one gentleman there, maybe in his 20s. He has such an upbeat attitude. Always friendly, polite, kind. He's always making sure that customers sitting down and picking up take out feel welcomed, he's a huge part of why I can consistently come here and eat. 

If you like kabobs, this is a place you need to try!"}
{"text":"I find myself getting Afghan almost every time I go to Mississauga. This is one of my options. I have certain expectations of Afghan meals and this place meets them all. Fresh naan bread, meat is not over/under cooked, rice has flavor but not overly swimming in oil, and some sauces. Check check check. 4 stars. Prices on point. Non-existent service just like most middle eastern places, but I don't mind at all. I would definitely come back. 

There are many Afghan places in Sauga and most of them are on point. I haven't given any a poor rating yet. Most of them are about the same. I usually just end up going to whatever's closest for convenience."}
{"text":"I've tried several Afghan kebab restaurants in Mississauga and this is by far the best.  I think I've tried most of the meat items on the menu.  The lamb shank with Qabilee Palow is outstanding.

I usually get my order take-out.  My usual order is the Sultani Kebob dinner which comes with rice, salad, and Afghan bread.  The bread has toasted nigella seeds which I find very unique. I have found that their Tandoori Chicken is much hotter/spicier than versions at Indian or Pakistani restaurants. The counter staff have always been friendly.

I have not eaten in the dining room, but it is well-lit and clean,"}
{"text":"Dudes and dudettes - I want to give this place 5 stars or 3 stars! I don't know what to do!

After reading David's review, I had to go and try the lamb shank.  I walked in and the place was very quiet.  There are some slight cracks in the flooring, but place was nicely decorated and furnished.  However, when you walk in, you are hit with a big grill/food smell and some people may like that, but I prefer not to smell like my food.  In addition, there is no wall menu, and the cashier (at first) seemed very distant.  So for service and atmosphere 2.5/5.  

But I didn't dine in, I did takeout.  I knew I had to do takeout the moment I walked in because I don't like to smell like food or else I'd end up eating myself.  I digress.  So yeah, ordered the lamb shank with rice.

The lamb shank was very tasty and was fall off the bone.  I can see why David likes it a lot.  The rice was more sweet and while not my style, I just added their hot sauce to it. The hot sauce is more of a Chinese style hot pepper sauce that you might see at a congee place, but it goes very well with the rice. Delicious.  So food 5/5.  

I guess that means on average, that's a 3.75/5, and I'll round up to 4 since its a small business and I want to support them."}
{"text":"This place is a bit too pricey and expensive, other afghan joints are a but cheaper than here."}
{"text":"The inside of the place looks a lot nicer than you'd expect. I'm sure I'm not alone in this first impression of the restaurant. 

I visited 6 minutes before closing, while they were cleaning. Though they wouldn't allow sit-down diners at the time (which is totally understandable), they did accommodate my group's fairly large takeout order. 

I had the lamb shank dinner, which includes rice, salad, and naan ($11.50). The shank was a decent-sized portion of meat, nothing super impressive. It was cooked to be very moist and flavourful though, and easily fell off the bone. Though it isn't inherently unique in any way, I haven't visited many places that have a similar dish. It was very good. 

The basmati rice was topped with raisins and carrots, and was quite sweet. It's definitely a unique pairing that I'm happy I've tried. The naan and salad are quite nondescript - shaved lettuce and a thick slice of naan. Not the worst I've tried, but nothing special. The salad didn't come with any dressing, which may delight many (but not me). 

The 4-star rating I'm giving is for the core offering - the lamb shank. The accompaniments in the meal were decent but not noteworthy. Service was adequate, the servers were friendly and created a casual atmosphere. 

Lastly - the part that matters most - would I make a return visit? Yes. That lamb shank is too good."}
{"text":"Overall its pretty decent place I've eaten there a few times now in the Bamiyan kebab sweepstakes. 
Service is pretty basic. The  attractive Asian woman with blonde hair seems to be spending more time in the back than in the front. I guess there's more than just food that's cooking. 
The rice , naan bread and salad are just standard fare. I had the double tikka  dinner with a skewer of beef and chicken for $16.50 which is a decent price since the quality is just as good as anywhere.
I never got around to trying the lamb shank that people have talked about in previous reviews. I would say Bamiyan Kabab does give slightly larger portions of meat although the quality is comparable."}
{"text":"Moved into the area a year and a half ago. When doing some renovations a friend brought over a bunch of wraps.  Well it is now my go to place. I eat there at least once a week! They are perfect when your hungry and need something fast. The wrap special is the best for a fast cheap eat. The wrap (chicken my fav) and pop. $5 plus tax.  This is the lunch special, but I've paid the same price even after the lunch time special was up. The serving is perfect and not small in anyway. I always add rice so should you and hot sauce if you like that kick. Over all i recommend this place to everyone. When friends come over we phone an order in and pick up. 

Eat in or take out. Great service. Great price. I've eaten in and dish sizes are real good."}
{"text":"We came here one evening.  We were starving and not feeling like cooking.  I was pretty happy with my food.  I ordered from the menu that's above the cashier.  I can't complain about the portion size, it was a massive box of rice and 2 big meat kebob things.  I'm glad I read Bilal's review, because I asked about the white sauce and they gave it to me.  Also it was $9.99 + tax or something crazy.  I was stuffed!  I wish I could remember what it was called, but I think it was the second from the right and it started with an \"S\".  (I clearly should have taken a picture) or the menu.  One thing...they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, it took like 20.  I think they think it takes 10 but it doesn't."}
{"text":"This place serves delicious and healthy meals. Big portions and fresh bread. I usually get either the chicken kebob or the shami kebob. Cant go wrong with either one. Dont forget to ask for the dinner so you get the delicious rice with your meal"}
{"text":"The quality of food is consistently good.  

Favourites: Shami rice dinner, korma, and beef kebobs.  

Their chapli is a bit too spicy for my liking.  But if your tolerance for spice is on the hotter side you may like it.  

When I order take out, I always order an extra side of rice.  Their rice is that good!"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place for lunch. Got in before 3:30 to try one of the 8.99 meals and got the shami kebob. Was only a 1$ off their regular menu(+a pop), but got it nonetheless. Very decent food prices. The staff was also nice and polite. 

Food came in about 8-10 minutes like the guy said. They don't give you naan bread like other places do. 
Big portions of food, fresh. However, comparing to bamyan kebab, the salad was quite empty, just a lot of lettuce put on, barely any tomatoes or cucumbers or even sauce on top of it. 
The rice was topped off with a nice flavour and the kebab was amazing! 
Will definitely be back to try their lamb shank!"}
{"text":"Great alternative when I don't wanna drive all the way to Watan Kabob!  This place is literally up the street from me...and much more quiet than Watan.  I *don't* think they have fish though which sucks 'cause I really like the fish at Watan.

I came in for a takeout and it did take a while for my order to roll out, just under 15mins I'd say, but everything was fresh, fresh, fresh!  Tastes similar to Watan, but the Tandoori Chicken ($11.99 for dinner) here wasn't as red/spicy.  Could use a bit more heat, but that's what the hot sauce is for, right?

Dinners are good value as you can spread them out for at least 2 meals.  Once for dinner, the rest for lunch the next day!

Salad was meh as lettuce was shredded, bottom didn't look super fresh, and dressing was just squirted on top.  I just ate it to mix up the protein/carbs combo.

Would definitely visit again and check out other items on the menu, especially the lamb shank!"}
{"text":"A no frills, hidden gem nestled in a Rexdale strip mall that really hits the spot. Clearly a family run joint that serves up a ton of different Afghan options in an area that could use more Middle Eastern cuisine. I opted for the chicken tandoori wrap and they threw the skewer right over the fire when I ordered, so you can appreciate the freshness. Awesome tandoori seasoning, great in-house hot sauce and their naan-reminiscent flatbread really puts this wrap over the edge."}
{"text":"Carefully seasoned meats and super tender lamb shank! I must come back to this restaurant and encourage everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"My dad comes here a lot because the food is so fresh!

I popped in on Monday for dinner. Got the chapli kebab. It is a ground beef patty that looks like a burger but with spices. So good and so fresh! I opted out of the rice and naan bread. Service is a bit slow but I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when I want to get away from the traditional American and excessive Chinese restaurants.
I've never tried a different cuisine other than the said above until last year and man, all I've got to say is that I've been missing out for way too long.

The staff here is very polite and some of them actually engages in conversations with you, I've never been looked at weird or spoken rudely to, which ive experienced first hand at other middle eastern restaurants in the area. They treat me like a brother.

Another bonus about this place is that they deliver right to your door step through \"Skip The Dishes\" and you could also call and order for pickup.

I've introduced my parents, siblings and a handful of friends to their food and they also love it.  5/5 from a newly loyal customer."}
{"text":"Excellent Afgan food near the heart of Mississauga right by the Mavis and Burnhamthorpe junction.

We had the lamb shank which came with basmati rice with raisins and some bread.

The lamb was excellent and rice very moist.

I topped it with lots of chilli sauce and had a wonderful meal!

See the pics I took!

I have since been back and this time had the lamb chops which was quite good but I think I will stick with the shank next time!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Afgan kabob restaurants. They have one of the best kofta and shomi kabobs (both chicken and beef) in the city. Freshly grilled each time i order and the price is reasonable. The restaurant is close to major highways and there are parkings in front. They do not have very large dining area, so, may not be good for large group."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the lamb shank here!  It is so tender and fall off the bone kind!  The chilli sauce that goes with it is also a must.  It brings out the flavour in the lamb shank so well.  The raisin and sliced carrot rice is also marvellous.  

Price for lamb shank is $12.  There are many other Afghan dishes here that are also great.  All around the $10-13 range.  My other favourite is Mantou which is a neat savoury dumpling with yogurt on top of it.  Super yummy!

You can just order the rice alone as well.  Great side dish as an extra.  Definitely recommend this Afghan place for a fantastic tender lamb shank."}
{"text":"Good pricing
Pleasant service 
Tried the Mantu for lunch. Was good. Although the dumplings could've had a little more meat in them. But not bad for what it is."}
