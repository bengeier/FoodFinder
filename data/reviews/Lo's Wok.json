{"text":"FMP food court used to be full of places serving Cantonese style cuisine. Many of my previous go-to food stalls have closed down. One of the remaining restaurants is Lo's Wok. They serve pretty standard fare with options for \"daily special\" entrees on rice for $6.50-$7.50. For those with bigger appetites or needing to feed several hungry individuals, set meals for one ($8.99), two (17.50), three ($26.00), or four ($32.00) are available. The set meals allow you to choose your main dish (such as sweet and sour pork, or spicy deep fried squid, or sliced beef with broccoli), with which rice and free daily soup or soya milk is included. 

In a rush to get the food to my hungry family, I didn't open up the takeout containers to inspect my order. Upon arriving home, I was mainly disappointed with the food. The spicy deep fried squid I ordered had only a dozen small pieces of squid with the remainder of the container filled with styrofoam-looking fried noodles. The beef with broccoli was slightly better, with ample amounts of \"Canadian broccoli\" (as opposed to Chinese broccoli or gai lan) but relatively little beef. The sweet and sour pork actually had a decent amount of pork in it. However unlike other places, it was not served with any stir fried bell peppers or even onions. 

I was secretly hoping that this place might replace my previous FMP go-to of Oriental Delight, where I used to order party trays of food. Unfortunately due to underwhelming food, and questionable cleanliness, I don't think I'll be returning to dine here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tried the location since I was in the mall. Was looking for a place my dad and I used to go but seems they closed down. So I said why not try them! 

I ordered a general tso, fried wontons, and a coke. Cost about 14 bucks. 

The wontons are delicious and a definite recommend. The general tso was okay, nothing amazing and had a bit of chewy fat bits, but I could eat it. When I was getting full, I bailed on the chicken and enjoyed the wontons. The coke was good too in case you're wondering. 

All in all, if your close by, it's an okay choice. Not the greatest, but I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"This review is strictly to rave about their tofu pudding which is quite an amazing value. For only $2.50 you're getting the entire bucket of tofu pudding which is cheaper than what you're paying for at dim sum. Quality of the tofu is excellently done as well, velvety soft and dissolves in your mouth. 5/5 just for this tofu pudding.

However, can't say much about anything else on the menu sorry folks lol typical chinese food court fare, hence minus one star.

Just come for that tofu pudding after dim sum or whenever you're craving for some no nonsense tofu pudding (1000x better than what they serve at sugar marmalade, trust)."}
