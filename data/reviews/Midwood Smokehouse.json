{"text":"We went last night finally after craving some barbeque for weeks.  Overall, our experience was awesome.  We had an awesome server, Cliff, who gave us his suggestions and was pretty entertaining.  We took Cliff's suggestion and got the Combo platter since we were newbs.  We ordered the brisket, ribs and doubled up on the pork bbq.  For our sides we got mac n cheese and fries.  Everything was really great.  The ribs were probably our least favorite, but they still tasted great.. just not as tender as we were hoping!  Pretty good beer selection and great service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"best bbq in charlotte..... bacon wrapped jalepenos were just alright though. bacon seemed a little on the chewy side, possibly just a preference. hushpuppies awesome. baked beans awesome. also, they have great ice.   service was wonderful, friendly, energetic"}
{"text":"Great bbq just outside the city.  Great atmosphere but they have very limited table seating and parties of 5 or more can only sit at the high top tables. (at least that's what we were told) I've dined at countless bbq restaurants and have made great bbq for 15 years and every place is different.  I will tell you this about Midwood:  it is true SMOKEY bbq.  If you like your bbq on the sweeter side and not as smokey, this place is NOT for you.  Personally, I appreciate most styles and tend to make my own this same way so I found it pretty tasty.  The Cuban sandwich was great also as were the sides."}
{"text":"My favorite barbeque in Charlotte.  If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have only rated it a 3...because they had removed the smoked, creamed corn from the menu for a while.  It is back and I love it!  My favorite time is to swing by after church (Calvary Church...shameless plug) when the Panthers are playing.  I enjoy the first half of the game with my family and then head home at half time!    My favorite dish is their smoked brisket with collard greens.  Get their pepper sauce!  If the color is bright...it is new and not too hot, but if you want good flavor, look for the more muted colors.  They have at least 3 types of hot pepper in the sauce, which makes for a yummy taste.  The brisket is tender and smoky, and really does not need sauce, but the sauce is tasty too.    The bacon wrapped jalapenos vary in heat...be warned...sometimes you will get a tasty one that seems mild, and then sometimes you will get a heat bite...still tasty, but be aware.  Oh, and the pecan \"cobbler\" is rich and yummy...plan on rolling out of there if you get that.  It is football season, see you there."}
{"text":"To be frank I am in love with Midwood smokehouse.  My wife and I went on our first date here, it's the first restaurant I bring family/friends to when visiting, and it's the first words out of my mouth when somebody asks where to go for BBQ.    I always get the giant platter with a nice portion of everything on it.  I kid you not I can usually feed a couple of people with the leftovers.  The Brisket and the ribs are the stars of the show but everything else is fantastic as well.  The sides are great and I don't think I can ever get my fill of bacon wrapped jalapenos and hushpuppies. Thinking of the warm evenings I've spent eating in the outdoor section with a bourbon, giant plate of bbq, watching the sun go down is keeping me warm this winter! Are you still reading this?  Get your butt over to midwood!"}
{"text":"I had the Pimento Cheese Fries, Burnt Ends and fries. The pimento cheese was bland and didn't add anything to the fries. I honestly could've done without it. Burnt Ends were a different experience. I liked the idea of crispy brisket, but half of the cubes were partially fat and there didn't seem to be enough flavor in the BBQ Sauce. They were alright, but i don't think i would order them again. The beer specials were good and the service was excellent. No complaints there."}
{"text":"OMG the brisket is so good. Midwood has somehow figured out how to smoke. The food we had was very good and the brisket was a highlight for sure. The mac n cheese was also incredible. Local craft beers on tap and all in all a great place for some meat and sides that were very well done."}
{"text":"Just now getting to doing a review! Was in Charlotte for the day of meetings and managed to grab lunch. What a treat!!! Food and service were spot on. We had the bacon wrapped jalapeños ... Delicious! Followed by chicken/rib combo... So good. Will definitely be back when in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Midwood and was so disappointed. It was awful. The pork tasted like someone had poured liquid smoke over it and it was dry. The sides were not good either! I actually threw away the entire meal and ate a pb&j at home. I was so disappointed because I had heard great things!"}
{"text":"So far the best we have found in Charlotte.  Pulled pork is cooked and seasoned just right!  Don't miss the fried pickles and save room for the pecan cobbler.  Warm pecan cobbler is amazing and worth every calorie!!  Atmosphere is fun, great outdoor seating for when the weather is warm."}
{"text":"So much food!!!! OMG.. we went for my sister's b-day and I don't think any of us could move after. Great service, fun staff.. tons of food and yumm-o desserts!"}
{"text":"this has got to be the greatest bbq in charlotte nc. from the food to the staff, this place is the best..... been here several times and never disappointed.  a must try"}
{"text":"AMAZING BBQ! Glad my friend recommended this place. Got a few \"pig outs\" for our group and was not disappointed.  Better than a Chase Utley Home run in September. It's Cadillac time!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!! I love their food! I've gotten take out during the holidays, and I ate in yesterday. Service was excellent! Tom was very knowledgeable and patient, explaining sauces & flavors easily from food to drinks. He was very thoughtful and I can't wait to go back. Even though they were busy, the food came not and timely. The 1/2 roasted chicken, brisket, chopped salad, Mac & cheese, greens, and hushpuppies were fantastic! I just enjoyed it all. However, the banana pudding although tasty didnt seem fresh. The bananas were already gray/brown and slightly slimey...um, yall need to fix that ASAP lol- That's the only reason its not 5 stars. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place, after the reviews .  Hubby and I shared the combination  pick 4 items and 2 sides.  St Louis ribs, pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage with mac and cheese and bacon  jalapenos.  The ribs was delish ! I could not believe how much meat was on them.  Everything was very tasty.  Our server was very good in helping us decide.  Nice place !."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood option for barbecue. They offer a little bit of everything for everyone--no matter where you fall on the great NC sauce debate (red or vinegar) or SC mustard-style. The pulled pork and the pork ribs are my favorites here. There are good beer options. Standout sides are hushpuppies and mac and cheese. The slaw is only OK, but to me, slaw is essential for barbecue. This is why I wish the small plates came with two sides. The sweet pickled onions are a nice touch. There is a reason it sometimes gets crowded."}
{"text":"The burn ends looks very ugly,like black rocks on a plate. But it tastes very good! Crispy outter layer and juicy inside. Worth to try! The side of creamy corn is also very good!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. 1 star for the service. Multiple tables that arrived and ordered after us got their food 10 minutes before us. The server ignored us and kept going to other tables. The managers excuses were annoying too. She said because we ordered grilled items they take longer but how did it take my medium burger 10 minutes longer than the 3 well done burgers ordered by the ladies sitting next to us that came in 10 minutes after us.Then the manager offered us desserts and said she had already let the server know. He never asked us what desserts we wanted and I had to flag down the manager to take care of us."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We were on the prowl for quality 'cue and chose to visit Midwood Smokehouse. Our server was friendly and prompt and made good recommendations. We got half price local beers--the Bad Penny is a Tasty Deal--and split the \"Choose 4\" platter between the two of us with a few bites to spare. With three beers and lunch for two, it was $30 (not incl. tip). A fair deal!  I'm not always a sausage fan, but their version is packed with flavor and nice and moist. I also can't stand mustard, but I swear this version with the sausage tasted like tangy cream sauce. The beef brisket was one of the more tender, flavorful versions I've had, and paired with their brown sugary house sauce, all I can compare it to is Christmas.  Mac n' cheese was just dandy, and the fries were hot and crispy.   Hush puppies were well done, but would have been phenomenal with a side of honey.  All in all, a good barbecue place we will visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq especially the brisket burnt ends and don't forget the pecan cobbler.  Food and service were great.  A very good dinner"}
{"text":"This was our first stop of our BBQ weekend in the Carolinas and it didn't disappoint us.  We ordered the well-fed BBQ combo and was worried we might not have enough food, but by the time when we leave, we're indeed very much well-fed. We ordered ribs, brisket, pulled chicken and chopped pork. In one word, delicious! or in two words, not disappointed! We even ordered some extra meats to take with us. It's a long drive from home, but we will visit the place again."}
{"text":"I have been to Midwood a few times now and have never been disappointed. Service is always nice, atmosphere is pleasant. But the ribs! Om nom nom. We always share the big combo that has a variety of meats and two sides. My favorite is the ribs, tasty without any sauce and falling off the bone. Macaroni and cheese is always perfect as well.  For dessert, the banana pudding is a good option.   Overall, always a good choice for barbeque."}
{"text":"Love the decor. The service was excellent and all the good was great! Prices were reasonable also. Have gone before and will come back often."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the pre-opening. Wait staff very professional and eager to please. Food delicious."}
{"text":"Been here 5 or 6 times since I moved to Charlotte last year. As a lover of 'cue who has traveled all over the south in search of the choice stuff, I've actually been kinda disappointed with the clt bbq scene overall.  But midwood smokehouse holds its own.  I mean, it's no 12-Bones (outta Asheville), but you'll leave happy enough.  The ribs are quite good, as is the pulled pork and brisket (I like a mix of lean and fatty).  Sausage was only alright, and I'd steer clear of the KC burnt ends, normally one of my favorites, but which were too tough and bland for my liking (lacking that sharp bark-y zing). Sides are solid: mac and cheese, beans, Carolina slaw, and bacon-wrapped cheesy jalapeños for the m'fin WIN!  Also has pretty good beer list, especially if you like NC and Southeastern craft brews."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Just want to start off and say this was an amazing experience and BBQ.  In Charlotte one night, I had to pick right or I risked having a bad foodie experience in Charlotte.  I did it!  Sydney was our waitress and she was awesome!  Super friendly and took the time to educate my coworker and myself on North Carolina BBQ.  We even met Jenn, one of the managers there who was kind enough to show us the Smoker and explained how all the magic works.  That was awesome!   Lastly, I ordered the following: Carolina Shredded Pork & BBQ Chicken, Brisket, and St. Louis Style ribs, ALL were fantastic and my coworker and I would definitely order ALL of them again.  A must have, is there creamed corn, so good!  Midwood Smokehouse is right up there with ALL the GREAT BBQ smokehouses in the country!! I recommend making Midwood Smokehouse a destination when you are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan of barbecue before coming here. Now I am. The sweet potato fries were forgettable but the small bbq plate I had was a generous portion, reasonable price, and the most tender, flavorful barbecue I have ever had. I Will most definitely be coming back here. Parking was an issue at lunch so maybe try to come at a less busy time,"}
{"text":"This is another totally overrated BBQ place.  How is it that few in this town have experienced really succulent ribs with a dry rub?  I had a brisket sandwich...barely passable.  Maybe customers at Midwood should eat first, to really taste the food, then drink their spirits to help them forget they just overpaid for mediocre BBQ.  In case you think I'm wrong-take a drive up to Saluda, NC It just 90 minutes west of here-there's a place called Green River BBQ   Their brisket sandwich is as good as great sex!  It's a hole in the wall, been there for years, owned and operated by a woman who cares about the food, the service, the customer."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it very much! One of my favorite bbqs in town!  I had been meaning to eat at this place sooner, but every time I would drive by, there was a ton of people outside waiting to get in or no place to park. Then I saw on TV that Obama and Hilary Clinton had stopped in so I knew then I had to check it out! So we headed there at about 5pm on a Saturday.   I had the dry rub ribs with sweet potato fries and a side of sliced brisket. He had the pulled pork with a side of burned ends. We specifically asked for side of just meat because we didn't want to make another full plate that came with more side items like fries, etc. So this is the easiest way if you want to sample the different types of meats they offer. Also, it wasn't expensive to add this on (something like $5 each).   I thought the price was excellent for what you got. The dry rub ribs were some of the meatiest and tastiest I ever had in Charlotte. I am giving this place 4 stars and not 5 because of the crowds, limited parking, and mediocre decor."}
{"text":"From out of state visiting for the weekend and was craving some good ole' BBQ. Stumbled upon this place and what a great find!  The food was DELISH and I loved the atmosphere.  Sat and ate at bar.  Bartender was super nice and very attentive.  Will most definitely go back next time I travel to Charlotte."}
{"text":"BBQ HEAVEN!!!! with a side of Mac and their amazing hush puppies and my belly is so happy."}
{"text":"Great NC pulled pork with warm vinegar sauce. Great BBQ coleslaw. Pimento cheese fries were very good. Good service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times and have enjoyed it everytime. The place is usually packed and the food has been great. The only issue I have with the place is it is a heck of a time to find parking!"}
{"text":"My parents were in town last night and I live on the east side so I wanted to keep it local and chose Midwood Smokehouse !  Boy am I glad I did...  We had a wonderful dinner !!  Everything was just delicious !!  I dont have time for a long review but I would recommend this place to anyone !  I want to go back for lunch today !  I love east side Charlotte...."}
{"text":"Great Barbecue spot! Fantastic BBQ chicken sandwich. The Midwood sauce is a nice spicy rich sauce. Good local craft beer options. Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ at fair prices.  Serivice is quick and staff is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has great food and good service. Pulled pork was delicious! You have to try the pickled onions they had a nice sweetness to them."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good BBQ. Of course I am - I'm a Southerner by birth and the grace of God! So I am always excited by the prospect of some good 'cue.   I'm sad to say, I gotta give it 3*s 'cos it's a crazy mixed bag. Some things are incredible (this is some of the best pulled pork and mustard sauce I've had in the Queen City, and no mistake about that; the bacon-wrapped jalapenos are delicious; and the collards are downright tasty), but other things kinda... Suck, frankly (as noted by others, the service, for one - why did I have to ask MULTIPLE TIMES to have my water replenished, for example? I don't know - they weren't that crowded). And some of the menu items kinda just didn't get it done for me - the ribs, for example, were well-prepared, but I couldn't taste the ribs for the flavour of the wood in which they were smoked; the mac 'n cheese is merely middlin', and Mac's brisket is far superior. And since when does a server not offer dessert, anyhow?   So, it gets a solid three: what it gets right, it gets CRAZY right. What it gets wrong, though, really puts a damper on things."}
{"text":"Wow, guess we caught the new Midwood location at a bad time. I've seen and read many favorable reviews, sadly, our experience was such that I told the manager on duty their products were average, at best. We arrived at 9:30, probably not the best time, but if the lights are on and the doors are open, the food should be as good as Noon or 7:00 PM. It was not, not even close. When we opened the car door the smell of wood smoke was a wonderful welcome, that was the highlight. We went in and waited and when no staff came to seat us I went to the bar to ask if they were still serving. She said yes and seated us. It was obvious folks were working to close, it appeared the kitchen had closed down early too. We got four portions of meat -- chicken, pork, brisket and ribs. Without exception they were all overcooked. The ribs were not hot (barely warm) but they were tough and dry. If I had been blindfolded, except for the texture of the meats, I could not tell the difference in taste between the pork and chicken. The chicken was overly moist, as though it had been in a holding tray being warmed and water condensation had dripped on the meat making it too soft. The brisket had a nice smoke ring but like the pork seemed to have been cooked much earlier and dried out. As a result it was tough like the ribs. I have eaten and judged BBQ throughout the southeast, as I told the manager, this would not have made my top ten. In fact if I was judging, under the rules I would have had to write individual notes on each sample as the score would have been so low. Hopefully it was a bad day, the review have been good but on this night it was average, at best. I will go back, it has to be better..."}
{"text":"We had brisket, chicken and pulled pork, they were all equally delicious. Great sauces and sides. Cute, nice and clean place with friendly service."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ we've ever had, especially the queso dip."}
{"text":"This place is just AMAZING. The atmosphere is loud and seating is limited. However the food is just great. If you're from NC or SC or even GA you can find some southern cuisine here to put a smile on your face. It's a little pricey in my opinion for this type of food but the portions are large and the flavors impressive."}
{"text":"As a fan of all things BBQ and a resident of the Elizabeth neighborhood, I was thrilled with Midwood opened. I wish my enthusiasm for the the place could have been maintained following my 3 meals there.  The food is on point over all. My only real beef is with the BBQ beans which lack the sweetness and bacony flavor that I expect with BBQ beans. There's are mushy and taste too much of green and red pepper for me. The 'cue is solid from the sandwich to the brisket, to the chicken.   Why only 2 stars then? Well, the easiest answer is the service is borderline terrible. While generally friendly enough, they tend to disappear for unacceptably long periods of time and when they do return to grace you with their presence they have usually forgotten something you requested, like a drink refill, or have delivered the wrong food. If you are gonna charge $8.00 for a chopped sandwich I don't think its unreasonable on my part to expect a consistent service to go along with it.   If you ask me, they seem all too aware of their owner and his other success and are resting on their laurels a little bit too soon."}
{"text":"God bless the South! Had the bbq sandwich with bbq slaw and mac'n'cheese, unsweet tea. Everything tasted just how you would want it to taste right down to the freshly made bun and the eastern NC sauce. The portion was just right for me so it might be on the small side for some. Other members of my party had the pulled chicken, crinkle cut fries which were fresh made, hush puppies, brisket and from scratch banana pudding. All were good. One person in my group enjoyed the Monday special of $3 pints of NC beer - he swears by OMB Copper Ale. Service was good - had Matt as our server - but we did go at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Monday."}
{"text":"Decent bbq, either we came on an off-night or this place is a tad over-rated on here. \"Texas Toast\" is essentially just toast, beans are good, smoked meats were tasty enough. Will likely stick with Mac's Speed Shop for bbq when we visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Just ate at the new Midwood Smokehouse in Ballantyne.  (I have always heard how great Midwood Smokehouse is, but never had a chance to check it out all the way on Central Avenue.)  The Ballantyne location is soooo convenient for me!  I have already had lunch there twice and dinner once.  Try the brisket and pulled pork!  Honestly, the best brisket I have ever had!  Service and management were very friendly and attentive.   I do a lot of business in the Ballantyne area and feel that I can trust these guys to take care of me.  Keep on doing it right, Midwood!"}
{"text":"Ok so I heard about this place, saw the high score with a lot of reviews and I was super excited to visit. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon and they were really busy. Place my order at the bar. Service was good for takeout. Although I wasn't staying, the atmosphere seemed cool. I ordered the ribs (sauced) with mac and cheese and baked beans. Oh yeah, I also got an extra side of creamed corn. On my first visit to places, I like to get several options. My hope is that at least one is a winner that gives me that gotta go back feeling. Well this one was a bust. The creamed corn was awful. It seemed to be fresh whole kernel corn with some sort of cream base added to it. I'm a southern girl. Fresh corn cut off the cob there is a natural milk that can be scraped off the cob to get a cream base if you are somewhat of a cook. Lol. The Mac and cheese was baked but it was just a step above that kiddy cheesy Mac that are in the commercials. The only reason I know it was baked it because it had that brown baked cheese topped crust which can be sooo good. This one had a charred tasted. The baked beans were the best of the sides but just ok. I could taste a tomato base. I'm just not a fan of tomato based baked beans. And finally the ribs. They are definitely smoked and seem to be slow cooked since they had no problem coming off the bone. Not the best ribs that I've tasted but I did enjoy them. All in all it didn't leave me with the feeling that I had to get back there and get back there soon. 2.5 stars would have been better but not so good that I was willing to round up to 3, so I'm leaving it at 2 stars."}
{"text":"Frank Scibelli extends his master restaurant skills to the realm of BBQ, with his newest creation, Midwood Smokehouse.  When the weather is good, the (two) patios expand the limited amount of tables to be decently acomodating; otherwise, expect a fairly significant wait.  Once seated, prepare to stuff your face, because the food is good and the portions are plentiful.  Surprisingly, there are a fair amount of veggie options on the menu - vegetarians aren't restricted to just a veggie plate of sides, but can also order a grilled cheese or black bean burger.  Unfortunately, the macaroni & cheese scores only about a B... bummer.  But the carnivore in all of us will be pleased by the pork, chicken, brisket, ribs, or smoked turkey, and three BBQ sauces (vinegar, Texas tomato-based, and SC mustard) satisfy even the most picky eater.  Don't fill up too much though, because the pecan cobbler is not to be missed... and yes, add the ice cream.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"The food was incredible (pork sandwich, and the caramelized brisket called \"burnt ends\") and our waiter was fantastic.  We will definitely visit every time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is unbelievable! I've been here a few times when I was absolutely craving some nice NC bbq. I usually get the BBQ pork sandwich and add cheddar cheese--unusual but makes the sandwich so good. Their bbq baked beans are also incredible! Looking for great southern bbq in Noda? This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best BBQ restaurants I have been to! The brisket burnt ends are amazing. All of the sides are delicious too."}
{"text":"Service here has gone down hill in a big way.  They have started nickel and diming customers for items that were previously free.   Came in for dinner with my daughter, and the waitress got upset that I was sharing her drink - very strange. Seems she wanted to charge me for that too, but generously opted not to.   Good quality is still fine, but customer service is lacking.   Too many other great barbecue restaurants in Charlotte than to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Midwood tops my list of BBQ spots in Charlotte. Macs, Queen City Q and City Smoke are great, but Midwood is my favorite.  Huge portions and a very diverse menu. Believe it or not, they have very healthy options and amazing salads. Granted, I prefer jalepeno poppers, burnt ends and mac & cheese.  Parking can be tight, but there's usually at least space on the street around the block.  Beer selection is fairly strong too."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but thought the prices we're too high for the portions. Also craft/import beers start of at $5 and up which is too expensive. Too many choices in Midwood with great value on food and drinks and don't see that at Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Better than most...  But not among the best BBQ in the city.  Good to above average service.  Visited for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner while traveling from Hilton Head.  Great choice for BBQ. We ordered the burnt ends and the pulled pork with collards and coleslaw as sides.  Everything was delicious.  Nice selection of local craft beers on tap.  They also have wine by the bottle.  Service great as well.  Seemed to be loved by the locals. We were near the bar and saw several customers picking up take out.  Recommend if you can enjoy BBQ."}
{"text":"Love the food but need MUCH improvement in customer service! Arrived at 7:41 pm to order takeout. Left at 8:27 with food! No \"I'm sorry\" or anything from servers at takeout counter (which is where I stood ignored for most of my wait). If there was anyone \"in charge\" at the bar/takeout counter, they must have been on break the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"Might be my favorite bbq place in town. Great food and great service at both the mid-wood and Ballantyne locations. Definitely have the brisket, ribs or the beer can chicken. And try the poppers"}
{"text":"Even though it was a Friday night when my friend and I went yesterday, we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  They have parking too, which is a huge plus for me!  I had the sausage, macaroni and cheese, and sweet potato fries.  It was a large portion for the price.  The sausage wasn't listed as a combo plate, just as a meat for the 4 meat combo, but I was able to order it anyway.  She had the macaroni and cheese, with added brisket, and ate every bite.  The bacon wrapped jalapeños had seeds removed, which I liked, since spicy food is not my favorite."}
{"text":"Believe the HYPE!  The hardest thing about eating here is deciding what to get.  There are so many options on the menu and everything looked tasty (looking around at other's plates).  I got the brisket and it was out of this world delicious.   The service could have been a bit better, but it wasn't bad.  My drinks were refilled and an occasional stop by was made.  They just didn't make me feel welcomed.  But, I'm not a needy person so that's alright with me.  The food won me over and I will be back time and again."}
{"text":"Went to the Ballantyne location. Was disappointed there were very few healthy choices.  Only two salad options to pick from!  Seriously?  That's what is wrong with our country and why so many people are just plain fat! I asked for the side of veggies and received a greasy oily mess.  Not going back unless you re-think your menu. Not everyone wants to be 20 lbs overweight!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ not far from downtown Charlotte. Restored my faith in Charlotte area BBQ.   Ribs: perfect amount of bite through and not dry at all. Rub was well balanced and no sauce needed.  Brisket: very moist with good flavor. Carolina chopped pork: excellent, moist, and just enough bark for a slight crunch. No extra sauce needed. Sausage: Very good. Seemed to be made in house or at least fresh from local supplier.   Sides: Mac n cheese was good but not stand out. The bbq baked beans were good with the right amount of sweetness and kick.   Overall, this is a great spot for bbq and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My sister and hubby were visiting from out of town and were dying to try this place out.  We went on a Sunday evening and it was beyond packed.  We were a party of 9 and they told us it would be about 1 hour wait.  We decided to wait and about 15-20 mintues later my sister went up there and god knows what she said to them but we were seated right away.  To start of the smell of the BBQ was absolutely mouth watering.    Once we ordered and waited about 10 mintues then the waitress comes out to say they ran out of ribs.  HUH??? but ok, we decided to go with the saugage and brisket. Then we asked them for a complimentary appetizer to make up for running out of ribs.  Guess what?? They all of a sudden had ribs left, so we ended up getting what we originally ordered.  Now to the food part.  The ribs and brisket were very tender, tasty and of good quality.  Definitely better than alot of other restaurants.  The baked beans we didn't care for.  They are very reasonably priced, actually cheaper than I expected.  For the 9 of us the bill came to $110.00  For the food 4 stars, price 5 stars and  the service, hhmm 3.  I would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing But bring back the fried pickles... PLEASE"}
{"text":"This place was busy!!! Even at 5pm on a Tuesday!   Came with a small group, was taken care of fairly quickly. We had a great waiter, can't recall his name :( but he was helpful. He really described each dish along with drink choices. He was awesome.   My group settled on the brisket, BBQ pork sandwich, and the chicken. We also had the bacon wrapped jalapeños. Along with sides of fries and hush puppies.   The meat was tender! The brisket was to die for. It was seriously so good. Especially when paired with their BBQ sauce. The pork was also nice and tender and packed full of great flavors. Loved the jalapeños, they weren't too spicy due to the bacon. Even the fries were cooked perfect. The boyfriend loves the hushpuppies (I'm not a fan of them in generally but he said they were great).   Nothing was left. Seriously. Every crumb was eaten.   Throughly enjoyed will be back."}
{"text":"Yum!  The best:  BBQ pork, chicken, beef brisket - they smoke it all!  THIS is the place we take friends and family who are visiting Charlotte for the first time.   Midwood lives up to the South's reputation for great barbecue.  In addition to sweet, sweet meats, they've got delicious sides (hush puppies & collards!), a great beer selection, and very reasonable prices.  Go!  Today!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Midwood Smokehouse is definitely the best BBQ restaurant in Charlotte. The pulled pork and the brisket are a must try. They have excellent cocktails as well. Try a Beehive!"}
{"text":"We went to Midwood Smokehouse tonight for dinner! It was great as usual. We arrived at about 6:15, which was perfect because we got to sit down right away. There was hardly anybody there. By the time we left (about 45 minutes later), there was definitely a wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a cross-country drive that took us through Charlotte.  It was recommended by a friend, and neither of us were disappointed, but I've had better NC BBQ in my day.  The pulled pork was a little too saucy for my taste (not vinegary enough), but the burnt tips were delicious.    The mac 'n cheese gets 5 stars.  I would go back just for that.  The queso with brisket was a little disappointing--tasted like fake cheese.  The service was great--they even allowed us to eat outside with our dog.     Overall, very satisfied with this stop."}
{"text":"Restaurant closed tonight for a corporate event for Met Life.  #lame"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and Service We went here on a very busy Saturday afternoon. Got seated very quickly. We ordered one of the combo plates. It was just enough for the 3 of us. Turkey was a little dry,but the pulled pork and ribs were great. Good sweet tea as well. Everyone was polite and attentive. Parking can be challenging."}
{"text":"Don't tell my grandmother, but the banana pudding is phenomenal.  The best I have ever had.  The take out service is slow every time we order, but the food is great.  The chopped salad with meat  is almost too big to eat, but it is delicious and the dressing choices are unique.  The burnt ends are good, as are the ribs, but surprisingly my favorite meal is a burger, Mac and cheese, and banana pudding."}
{"text":"Food is ok...not great. The service is inconsistent at best. Management is nowhere in sight. There are better options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth barbecue and brisket. The mac & cheese and creamed corn are also delicious. Try everything!  Also, if you like Cheerwine they serve it in glass bottles. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Barbecue was great.  We had burnt ends, brisket, chicken and salmon.  Loved all of it, except for the chicken.   The hush puppies, sweet potato fries and mac and cheese were all great.  Coleslaw is so so.  Food prices seem mostly reasonable, with some  priced under $10.     Mixed drinks a little high.  Lots of beer choices.  Server was friendly, but not overly attentive.  The five stars is for the barbecue"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way through town headed north.....great food, nice sized portions, super sides ......definately a great find!!!"}
{"text":"After getting mixed reviews of this restaurant we decided to give it a try. After a 30 minute wait, we were seated and service was prompt and satisfactory. My wife ordered the ribs, I ordered pulled pork. The food arrived promptly, but, unfortunately it was not particularly outstanding. The portions were generous, but my fries were limp and greasy, pulled pork was good. My wife's ribs were dry and not very \"meaty\". We found out later that if you want the \"meaty\" ribs you have to pay double! Really? The couple next to us found this out the hard way when they received their bill, which was over $30.00 for a rib dinner. While our dinner was ok, I doubt we will return, there are better choices available. I don't know, maybe it's the building they are in. Sticky Fingers closed because it went downhill in quality, hope Midwood Barbecue has better luck. They will have to improve greatly to ever get me to return."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed the New Smokehouse yet? What a bad yelper I have become. I originally went open weekend and was blown out of the water. Solid BBQ here! Go for the Brisket and Beer Specials!   So I've been twice, and if I cared not about my waste line it would probably be more. First of all you gotta start with the pimento cheese fries, why? two words: pulled pork. Yes they hook it up. I am actually really embarrassed that I ordered them because I am not a fry person. The roommate wanted them so I ordered them. A Must have!  As far as BBQ goes it is all smoked to perfection, unlike the other \"M\" place. Brisket is the best hands down, then ribs, chicken, pulled pork. It really is all good and the sauces aren't something you really need. The meat has such good flavor without it, but you know the mustard sauce is bang'n. Midwood has solid sides as well, tried them all.  I have never had a bad server and that bartender that looks like an all-growned-up Bobby Hill is so sweet! Great people all around. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Ballantyne location: Best BBQ we had in years! Excellent service when ordering takeout. The menu has something for everyone. We ordered Carolina BBQ, ribs, Cuban and burger. Not one negative thing to say."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte and have been enjoying dining my way around the city. Midwood Smokehouse was on my list from the get go, and my husband and I finally made it there on a recent Friday for dinner. I am noticing a trend in my reviews that when you can smell the restaurant from down the street, it's usually a great sign. We parked in the gravel lot off the side street, and could smell the smoker as we walked toward the restaurant. We arrived a little after 5:30 and were surprised that we pretty much had our pick of tables. The Yuengling draft special made this PA girl happy - we've spen the lastt 4 years in Texas without access to Yuengling - so we're thrilled that so many restaurants in Charlotte stock it. We split the Well-Fed Combo Platter - with Carolina pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, brisket, and chopped chicken barbecue.  The \"smaller\" Well-Fed combo platter was plenty of food for the two of us, I appreciated that our waitress did not try to convince us to go with the larger Pig-Out platter.The platter came with pickled onions, hush puppies, and choice of two sides - we picked barbecue baked beans and mac & cheese. The food came out pretty quickly and looked great! The ribs and pork were our favorite; after spending so much time in Texas, we should probably know better than to order brisket anywhere else - it was decent, but reminded me more of a pot roast than the brisket we've come to know and love. The mac & cheese was delicious - most barbecue joints in Texas don't offer it as a side, so I've been getting mac & cheese everywhere it's offered. We finished the meal with the peach cobbler ala mode, which was fantastic as well, love that it's only 75 cents to add ice cream. The only downside of the whole meal was that there was a piece of glass in my beer - but luckily I found it before it made it into my mouth! By the time we finished, almost all of the tables inside and many outside had filled, so we just arrived a little early that night. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love the \"fatty brisket\". Is it a chain??? I really don't know. I don't usually love chains, but the brisket is perfect every time! I used to go to the one in plaza before this one opened-always good! It's a place I go OCCASIONALLY bc the food all kinda has the same smokey smell and taste. But it's a place I  can depend on for yummy brisket."}
{"text":"A few months ago I posted a review complaining about the ridiculously high salt content of the meat.  (I enjoy high levels of salt, so you should know that when I complain about something being to salty, it's reached a level of ridiculousness).  Anyway, I'm pleased to say that they seem to have toned down the saltiness somewhat.  I'm giving them an extra star.  I highly recommend the smoked half-chicken, the brisket, and the ribs.  The hush puppies are the best I've ever had, though I'm not a fan of the hush-puppy genre.  For sides I recommend baked beans and slaw (or bbq slaw).  I also enjoy the pickled onions that come with every meal.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos are pretty boring, sadly.   They are just globs of fat without much flavor.  Staff is super friendly and owner is very nice."}
{"text":"I used their catering to host a Birthday party and I was thoroughly impressed how good it was. It was a crowd pleaser and made my hosting job a breeze. They were really good on having it fresh and ready at the time you need. We choose to pick it up 30 minutes before party started. It worked out perfect. Their side items such as baked beans and mac and cheese are pretty typical so I made my own very easily. So if your looking to host a big BBQ they will hook you up with some good BBQ. Thanks Midwood BBQ"}
{"text":"Lowcountry as sweet tea I know my own taste I shove mustard-based BBQ Into my face  Ambling into this split level  Church of smoked pork I ordered a plate of pulled ..and a fork  The sauce, so tangy I said, \"Wait a sec... This vinegar base Defies my red neck.\"  And the puppies So crispy, the insides so sweet Extra sauce on the side Complimenting the meat  No Bush's Best, no sir! No salty slime douse The baked beans they bake here, They bake them in house  If I had a thtomach of much wider girth I'd have thtuck around longer And had thome desserth.    Instead I played corn hole On the patio out front And finished my beer 'Cause I do what I want  One day I'll return For vinegar suits Those weeks that I drift From my mustard base roots."}
{"text":"I've been in the Carolinas for almost 10 years now and just finally found my favorite BBQ place! Love the quality of the food here. The ribs are cooked perfectly, all the bbq sauces are not overpowering and I LOVE the cheese fries! This is the only place I will go now."}
{"text":"We got the combo platter with Carolina Chopped Pork, Beef Brisket, Saint Louis Ribs, and Smoked Sausage. All of the meats were good, with the brisket being the best and the ribs being only ok. The pickled onions were delicious as was the sweet creamed corn. I would also recommend their drinks I got a Jack's Beehive (Tennessee Honey, Lemonade and Ginger Ale) which was great, but all of their drinks looked awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ we've experienced so far in the Charlotte area.  We lived in the Sanford NC area before moving to FT. Mill SC and had eaten at the Pik & Pig in Carthage NC and their pulled pork and Brisket is phenomenal.   This place is very good and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ.   My wife and I had moved from Memphis, TN and considered ourselves fairly good judges of BBQ from not only living in one of the towns known for great BBQ but also competing in competitions for many years.  It is hard to find a place that actually uses a smoker on site, most either cook off site an then reheat or steam their meat.  Smoke flavor is amazing, only knock is that the menu is a little limited and they don't have a \"sampler\" platter where you can get the brisket, pulled pork etc all on one plate.  Great addition to plaza midwood and will be going back for more!  Oh yea and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY the place to go.  Was recommended by close friends, and it did not disappoint.  It has become my favorite place to go. The brisket was awesome.  Staff is very attentive, but the best servers have been Matt and Brian.   Always good service and food.   Small plate seems to always be enough for a good meal, but the large plate is plenty to take  away for a meal later.     Everything on the menu is GREAT.  ONLY draw back is.... Parking can be a challenge at times. Make sure to check it out."}
{"text":"Extremely good barbecue, particularly the pulled pork and the brisket. The smokiness of the meat was perfect - not overwhelming, but dominating the flavor at the same time. These people know what they are doing. Also highly recommended: the dry wings with sauce on the side. WOW. Some of the best wings I've ever had, served sizzling on a cast iron plate, amazing flavor and you can enjoy the meat separate from the sauce.   Also worth checking out: the bacon wrapped jalapeños (not at all spicy, my fiancé through they were green peppers), the mac, and the collard greens"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful will take all my friends and family there. The beef brisket is so tender it just melts in your mouth and don't get me started on the hush puppies...wow"}
{"text":"Really some of the best pork I've had. Very moist, flavorful, and juicy. The taste without the sauce was excellent. I honestly thought the BBQ sauce took away from the pork flavor.   Cole slaw was not good, and the Mac and cheese was very so-so, but based on the excellent quality pork sandwich I will give it five stars."}
{"text":"It was pretty dope. Get the ribs. Get the burnt ends. Disclaimer: if you don't like fatty meat then don't get the burnt ends."}
{"text":"This place was legit.  The burnt ends required no additional sauce, and the side options were so impressive that I ordered a third.  The sweet tea was good, and we ended the meal with some banana pudding.  I also found the staff to be quite friendly.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Bar B Q!!  Love the brisket and the slaw is amazing!  I have only been there 3 times but every time is great!  Sometimes it's very busy on the weekend but worth the wait!  Great to sit outside and enjoy the view while enjoying great food.  All the sides are tasty!  I especially like the bacon wrapped jalapenos!  Yum!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that I am a 20 year restaurant veteran and somewhat of a BBQ afficianado.  After my second visit to Midwood, I am sad to say that I will not return. Evidently success has ruined the effort given and the portion sizes seem to be shrinking.   My entree last night was $40...a large sampler platter with double ribs so that I could sample both preparation styles, with both cuts of brisket (props for offering lean or fatty) and the sausage (which I had enjoyed on my first visit.  Beans and corn for sides.    Neither style of ribs was edible...tried as I might.  The waitress was friendly and fairly prompt with beverage refills prior to food being delivered, but no check back for quality.  When the waitress finally asked, she didn't believe me that the ribs were terrible- didn't send a manager, and disappeared after processing checks for our party of 6.  Sorry- neither value nor good ribs to be found here...."}
{"text":"For lunch the food was great...not a discounted lunch menu though.  Got the \"well-fed\" portion consisting of chicken, sausage, ribs and fatty brisket (vs lean...in TX we called this moist vs dry). Also creamed corn (meh, a little underdone but the cream was good) and cole slaw (phenomenal). Hush puppies are like savory onion donuts. 22 bucks for all that is not a bad deal. It fed both of us until we were bursting.   Atmosphere is new American bar and grill. Lots of televisions. Saw a few business lunches going on.  Would easily recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good but didn't understand their upgrade menu choices.  They ask you to pay more to get more of a certain item (on the 4 Protein entrée) but then you have to drop one of the other proteins.  Then I bumped it up to the \"extra\" amount and they made me drop another item.  Doesn't make sense and I certainly did not get 45 dollars worth of Q."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse did some catering for a Southern Christmas Party I hosted - and I have been meaning to post a review.  They were great to work with, offered great advice about how much food to get - rather than having me get way more than I needed.  The BBQ and smoked wings were the favorite items on my buffet!  The wing are fantastic, and the pork BBQ tender and delicious, made even better with their collection of sauces.  This place is legit.  Eating there is great, but consider them for some local, delicious catering for your next party as well!"}
{"text":"I was sad the day we moved to the suburbs. I've lived uptown for years and moving to south Charlotte made me feel like I was barrel aging and buying strollers. But that all changed when Midwood opened here. As good as ever and all the charm and culture is here too. The meats are all fantastic and they have great craft drinks too! We get takeout from here on late work nights."}
{"text":"I recommend the nachos with brisket and burnt ends! The hushpuppies, slaw & beans were in point as well. The service was friendly & helpful. Great beer selection too. Went 2x within 24hrs it was so good! I don't recommend their bloody marys or the pimento cheese fries, we has them plain & my daughter (who LOVES cheese) hated them too."}
{"text":"Our 12 hrs layover at Charlotte: Midwood was our second lunch. The meal consist of brisket, spareribs, sausage, pulled pork, hush puppies, baked beans and Mac n cheese!  All that food for only $22!!!!!  All the meat was deliciously smokey flavored.  My favorite was probably the spare ribs.  Hush puppies were not too greasy, just wish that there was jalepeno in it.  The baked bean was just perfect, great tangy smokey taste.  The Mac n cheese was sooo good, especially the top crispy crust.  Our waiter Andra was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Their homemade barbecue sauce is amazing and loved all of the sides.  You can order take out and it's just as good. I'm really glad I finally made it to Midwood and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Was there a few days ago and was really looking forward to trying this place but ended up disappointed. Had the brisket sandwich.  Menu said it was chopped but the texture was more like they threw it in a blender and pureed it.  They also served it with bleu cheese on it, which sounded strange but I figured it must be good or they wouldn't serve it.  I was wrong.  It was not a good combination at all and I found myself looking for mints after my meal to get rid of the aftertaste.  In addition there was hardly any brisket in the sandwich.  In fact I think there may have been as much bleu cheese as meat.  My friend had something else and simply said their meal  was okay.  Was expecting more for the price. In addition the meat tasted strangely like it wasn't really smoked but just had some artificial smoke flavoring added.   Wanted to love this place but that isn't what happened.  Went back about a year later - Was better.  Got the burnt ends and they were pretty good, along with some collard greens.   Nothing amazing but pretty good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: B Food: A- Service: B+  Low key/casual, very good food, and good service pretty much captures the Midwood Smokehouse.    Both the setting and service were good, in fact, they complement each other well.  This is not an in-your-face place, which would be antithetical to what bbq is all about.  It takes time to smoke the meat, it should take time to savor and enjoy.  The hickory smokes wings were very good; no sauce and they didn't need them at all. The brisket was very good and the collard greens-likewise.  I appreciated that one of the staff had a pepper infused vinegar and promptly put that in front of me--definitely good flavor there without overpowering the greens.  I like pickled onions....a lot and seeing them on the menu and then on the plate was a pleasant contrast to the rich brisket.  Midwood offers well balanced plate between the meat, greens, onions and hush puppies.  I don't trust a bbq place that finds the need to smother everything in sauce, the true flavor is in the meat.  Yes, I know styles differ, but for me it is about the unadulterated flavor of the smoked meat.  Midwood does a very nice job.  I would come back and try more on the menu.  If the other offerings are as good as the first, I could see going to five stars; however, with only one visit under my belt four stars are the maximum."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Great BBQ near uptown Charlotte on Central Ave."}
{"text":"Passing through and wanted good barbecue. Found the place!! Had the 22 sampler with extra ribs and Mac & cheese bacon wrapped jalapeño !! Really really great and great service to boot."}
{"text":"Drove 30 minutes for ribs on Father's Day.  Arrived at 5:30, sat at 6:00.  Put order for apps in.  Then ordered dinner.  Five minutes later were told that there were no ribs.  Brisket was good, but I wouldn't drive for brisket.  Feel like they should've offered free dessert or apps. free.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte we were looking for good bbq.  Visited thus restaurant and we're not disappointed.  Best briscuit and chicken.  Appetizer of pimento fries with briscuit and bacon wrapped jalapeños.  Dessert was also very good...pecan cobbler.  Service was the best ever in a restaurant from the second we walked in the door until we left"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the National Parks and Rec Convention. Our hotel the Westin, suggested Midwood Smokehouse. Great recommendation, friendly service, great atmosphere and excellent food. Loved the creamed corn, BBQ beans and banana pudding and sweet potato fries. And of course great, BBQ meats."}
{"text":"Always love everything I have ordered from here from the burnt ends, dinner specials and pulled pork! The cream of corn side is delicious and I love their salads. This place has not disappointed me yet!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very slow service. You would think they were cooking the bbq to order"}
{"text":"Stopped here as we were driving thru town and it was fantastic!  Drew, our server, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  They have an extensive bar menu - and showcase local as well.  They are a true smokehouse and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"At a workshop around the corner and knew I had to have lunch here!  Got the brisket (mixed, both lean & fat), sweet potato fries, mac & cheese and finished with might the best banana pudding I have ever had!!  This is a cornerstone for BBQ in the Charlotte region!!"}
{"text":"This place is good. The longer you live in NC the more of a bbq snob you become. Once you have convinced yourself that \"'y'all\" is an acceptable thing to say you have entered full on bbq snobbery. This place is good for the city life, its a comfortable setting, it was pretty good food but compared with all the other amazing bbq in NC, its just a pit stop between other bbq destinations outside of the city."}
{"text":"I have a hard time picking between this and Mac's Speed Shop for best BBQ in the city. Midwood is really close to my condo so I usually go here.   Oddly enough their pulled pork is my least favorite thing here. But literally everything else I've had on the menu is out of this world. Bacon wrapped jalapeños... umm YES. Brisket is phenomenal, BBQ chicken isn't run of the mill chicken at all, extremely flavorful and different. Just thinking about the smell of this place makes me hungry.  Tip: if you get the BBQ chicken instead of the mustard based BBQ sauce ask to get a few different ones on the side so you can taste them all."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly service. Good value. For your first time, bbq sampler is a good option, but the ribs are the best."}
{"text":"This place is the best BBQ I've had yet! The waiter was friendly, attentive and informative. The food was awesome and the atmosphere was enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best brisket in town.  I started off with the bacon wrapped jalapenos today and the bacon tasted a bit old, which is not normal for what I am used to at Midwood.  I also order the TX Brisket sandwich with the Philly-style Mac and Cheese, which also happened to be the day's special.  The Brisket sandwich was spectacular, but the Mac and cheese was basically a few peppers and a couple pieces of brisket slapped on top of Mac and Cheese... definitely not worth the $5 upgrade to the premium side.  The service was excellent and I will continue to go to Midwood as my 'goto' for BBQ in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Yummy. Sweet sauce is excellent. Ribs meaty and succulent. Mac & cheese is great as well. Go now!"}
{"text":"Parking is tricky and be prepared to wait.  It's worth it. Service is superb and the food won't disappoint. If you aren't a big eater there will be enough for a second round the next day."}
{"text":"I ate here last Friday. Got in right at 12 and they were already packed! We were able to sit at the bar and the food was terrific. I ate the pulled chicken with mustard sauce, it was very messy but very very good. I will defiantly come again!"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner at Midwood a few weeks ago and it turned out absolutely fabulously. Midwood is one of our favorite spots and we both knew we wanted to have our rehearsal here b/c the food is so Carolina and southern to us. I want to be clear that the success of this dinner is a testament to the staff at Midwood Ballantyne rather than the Midwood private events coordinator. I hate leaving negative reviews for 1 person but I felt Mark, in comparison to all of our other wedding vendors we worked with, was an office oriented person and regurgitated our contract when asked about things. It seemed like he was quick to say no or put restrictions on simple requests. An example of this is when asked if his staff could hang up 1 small banner and light a few LED votives in paper lanterns, he said no and told us we could get there 30 minutes before our scheduled dinner to set up decor but added that he couldn't guarantee our room would even be available 30 minutes prior. As a rehearsal dinner, of course we were going to be rehearsing right beforehand. Fortunately, I stopped by a few hours before our dinner on a whim (was getting manicure at Apple Nails across the street) and the staff on site was SO HELPFUL and didn't hesitate to say \"yes, we can easily take 5 minutes to hang a banner & turn on 10 LED votives!\". Anyway, with that rant out of the way, I want to make sure that I give credit to not only the awesome wait staff (wish I remembered their names!) but also the kitchen team b/c the food was wonderful. As always! We had about 30 people, so we chose to do 2 meat buffet with several sides, wings as appetizers, banana pudding dessert and beer and wine. Now on their private events menu they don't offer fries as a side and they actually forgot them initially but when I mentioned that we were supposed to have fries, they served a bunch of baskets of fries on all our tables! Which turned out great and I think people enjoyed having them to snack on (especially since french fries don't really translate well to heating dishes, right?). We stayed late and almost closed the place down, they were so nice and even brought out takeout boxes so that our guests could take leftovers! I would probably hesitate to book another Private Event with them b/c I like a more receptive Events Manager.  I have booked private events at The Capital Grill and Dressler's (both locations) and their Events Team were more customer service oriented, flexible and understanding with small requests. They are willing to go around their \"rules\" to make your event a success... and while the staff at Midwood Ballantyne were awesome, I shouldn't have to show up in person and request things on site and hope they are willing to do it for me, it's not fair to me or the team working that night. Love Midwood as always and I think it's the best BBQ in Charlotte so I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"They serve pretty tasty Southern BBQ. Our party had ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and various items from the children's menu.   There was not a complaint amongst us. The service was excellent and timely."}
{"text":"Midwood has a good thing going for itself: great food and drink in a comfortable yet casually upscale setting. I came with a group of four, and we happily dined on some crazy good pimento cheese fries and bacon wrapped jalapeños. Another major plus is $2 National Bohemian beers, which goes great with salty and smoky meat by the way. Delivering the knockout punch was my full rack of ribs, which was nothing short of phenomenal. Great stuff comes from the kitchen here and I'd love to come back!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ with multiple sauces - check.  Good service - check.  Fair market prices - check.  Generous portion size - check.  Fairly crowded (so you know it's good) on a weekday for lunch, but not too crowded for a long wait - check.  Parking adequate - check.  Eyes bigger than my stomach - check.  What's not to like?  Pimento cheese fries.  Bacon wrapped jalepenos.  Huge salads you can fix up with BBQ chicken/pork/etc.  I still love Mac's Speed Shop, as well, but Midwood Smokehouse provides an alternative closer to Dilworth (location of my employer).  I'm not sure a city can have too much high-end BBQ.  Not only is it in the rotation, I'm putting it near the top."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ sandwiches I've had in town. Their drinks are meh but appetizers are green light as well. Service was fast and our server was very friendly"}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork east carolina style bbq sandwich.....the vinegar based sauce was a little sweet which was nice to off set the saltiness of the sandwich.  I also tried the fried pickles which came out very fast even after the server informed me it takes a very long time.  When I got them they were so salty and soggy i threw the rest away.  The mac and cheese was good, but for 16.00 no drink included it was a rip off.   The location is cool for happy hour but the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte 3 months ago. I did the usual google searches for Carolina's best bbq, and i even told my friends, \"yeah its overrated i havent had anything worth writing hom about\" until today. I stumbled onto midwood smokehouse by accident.  The BBQ , sauce (not even needed the meat is so good), and sides were AWESOME!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"It is very Yummy BBQ. Consitently good. Good Service. Great beer selection.  The first time I went in, the waiter 'got mad at me' for getting a light beer and 'made me' \"get a real beer fit for a man who works everyday\". That was some good banter you wont get at a lot of places. It stays packed so be ready. Good people watching, great beer. pretty good BBQ. It isn't hardcore BBQ but this is Charlotte and good luck to you if you are looking for the holy grail. This is a great weekend place, with good food, nice people, great beer. Really can't go wrong for the money, quality of food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ our waiter Tyler was super nice!!  The best beef brisket I have had so far.  Very tender and the BBQ sauce on the table is so good.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm sad today. What was once my mainstay for BBQ in Charlotte is no more. Perhaps it's the challenge of repeating on a larger scale that which is successful on a smaller scale. Who knows. But it seems like the flavor of the food has taken a back seat to having it served quickly.   The ribs were simply bland. Same for the chicken. This from the one place where you could always order anything dry knowing that the flavor of the rub and smoke would shine through. Not so today.   On top of that, there aren't any bottles of BBQ sauce on the table to sample from. You have to ask for it and they basically have only three sauces (regular, vinegar and mustard).   Maybe I'll need to go back to the original location on Central. I'm hoping that they bring back the flavor. Even if it means a longer wait."}
{"text":"go to mac's or lancasters! i had very high hopes for this place... couldent wait for it to open and try it out. ordered it to go. got home and half the order was missing, and very small portions. high priced for what it is. they were out of a few items also, so before  you get your heart set on something call! they do have an awesome beer menu. cant comment on the ambience because i got it to go."}
{"text":"In town for one night and wanted BBQ.  Found Midwood and gave it a try.  It was nice to get out of the rain.  Atmosphere is very nice, clean and relaxing.  Waiter was friendly and beer and food selection were good.  Decided on the small sampler plate to try a few bbq items.  Brisket, turkey, pulled pork were all very good.  Vinegar and bbq sauce was average to good.  The sausage link was not to my taste but overall food, drink and staff were really good."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pimento cheese fries are a definite must try as are the smoked wings. I always order the BBQ sandwich and macaroni and cheese. I have yet to even try anything else due to the sheer perfection of these two items. The hubby usually gets a trio of ribs, sausage and burnt ends, its a huge plate with plenty to take home. The baked beans are kind of spicy, but we'll worth the heat. This has quickly become my favorite BBQ place in Charlotte. If you love good BBQ, midwood is a don't miss."}
{"text":"This is my first review and I was so impressed I had to.. I travel for a living and that travel takes me to all of the BBQ regions in our country. My company home office is in Kansas City, I have been all over Texas, travel to Memphis a good bit, and Lexington is right up the road... so I have been to the best all these areas have to offer. Milwood is different than all of those in a really good way! Prob borrow a little from those regions, and the result is their own thing going on.   I will just say you can tell someone has smoked a LOT of meats to get it this right. Most other BBQ places has something over-powering going on.. Either the smoke, the rub, the bbq sauce, but here it is such a good mix. That's why I say someone has smoked a lot of meats because no one gets that lucky lol. The ribs and chicken I tried were both smoked perfectly. The BBQ slaw was the best I have ever had! I do my own sauce at home and I will say one of the hardest things to do is to get the sweet vs sour just right, but they do here! I just appreciate something done right and they do smoking right hereI will be back!    Curt"}
{"text":"Great BBQ meal! We arrived at 11 pm for a late dinner after picking up friends from the airport.  We started with the bacon wrapped jalapeños which were tasty. Spicy jalapeños and smokey bacon, a win win! I ordered the Cuban which was delicious, juicy and perfectly pressed. The flavors of the pulled pork, ham, and the melted Swiss are a perfect combo. My friend ordered a chopped salad with the chicken and said the chicken was cooked perfectly with a great smoky flavor. And lastly, my other friend ordered the burger. Not much to say about a burger piled high with pulled pork and bacon with side of cole slaw. Delicious. Great selection of local beers on tap as well.  As I said, we arrived late and the kitchen closes at midnight. We were the only people left in the restaurant at around 11:45 pm and the staff didn't make us feel rushed to leave or approach us to move on.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Yep!  This place is awesome! !!  Best meat in town.  It's that brisket.   I dream about it!!"}
{"text":"We usually always go on weekends for lunch right when they open, thus we have no trouble being sat in a spacious, comfy, quiet booth.  The service is prompt, polite and never too \"in your face\" . The smoked wings or the jalapeños are a home run for an appetizer. Then again, everything on the menu is pretty much a home run depending on your taste. The food and drinks are consistently good. The atmosphere is welcoming, not overkill for a BBQ restaurant. All around an A+"}
{"text":"Have had the ribs at this location twice. The first time they were good; last night they were bad. I may return, but not anytime soon.  Service was very good on both visits."}
{"text":"That Sunday special need rib is so ridiculously good. The house salad is awesome and so is that avocado dressing. Sides are pretty good. I don't even care what the rest of the menu taste like I want to go just for that rib every time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite BBQ places in the city. Great beers on tap, bacon wrapped jalapeños are delish, and friendly servers. One time I came with my family and they were closed for renovations but gave us two $5 gift cards so that we would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing wings!  One of the best wings I've had.  Service is great!  Food was all good including the salad.  The ribs were very good and moist."}
{"text":"Visited this past weekend.  The food was really good.  We started off with the smoked wings,  pretty good nice flavor, but not as good as Sticky Fingers smoked wings.  We had burnt ends plate and the the combo platter with brisket, ribs, turkey and pulled pork  Burnt ends-  Good but nothing special  Brisket-  Juicy and flavorful (portions on the combo werent that big)  Turkey-  surprisingly the best thing on the plate,  good flavor and was very moist  Ribs-  A little too fall off the bone for me, but were still very tasty  Pulled Pork-  Not bad  very juicy the flavor wasnt to my liking though  Sides we had Mac and Cheese -  Nothing special here but still good  BBQ Baked Beans-  were  the best beans I have had EVER!  So good I had to order some to go ( kinda disappointed though because for $5.00 the container I got was on the small side and not even full)  So far this is the best BBQ I have had in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I came here recently with a large group during a 3 day conference being held downtown.  Despite being told by multiple cab drivers that Charlotte is not known for its BBQ, this place was surprisingly good (and I say this after a recent visit to Austin where all we did was eat BBQ the entire time).   We came with a party of 12 on a Friday night at 7:15 p.m. with no reservation.  The host was very friendly and kept us updated as to our remaining wait time.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes - 1 hour; luckily we had drinks at the bar to entertain us.    I ordered the smoked half chicken Midwood style.  This dish was only $10 and came with hush puppies and two sides!!!  I got the baked beans, vinegar coleslaw, and collard greens.  The chicken was juicy and tender and the BBQ sauce had a nice spiciness to it without being to vinegary.  The baked beans were delicious and had a good amount of meat.  The collard greens and coleslaw were also solid.  I attempted to eat only half of the massive portion of food but somehow ended up finishing the entire plate.  Others in my group had the burnt ends, mac and cheese, ribs, etc. and all said they enjoyed their food.  One thing that could make this place better is if they offered biscuits or cornbread...all they have currently is Texas toast.   Our server was extremely attentive and friendly.  She didn't bat an eye when we requested separate checks even though I'm sure this was a supreme hassle.  Good atmosphere and food - I recommend coming here if you are in the mood for BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is where I get my barbecue in Charlotte, hands down. I am a fanatical fan of pulled pork and have suffered through a lot of poor excuses for barbecue - which is inexcusable in NC. Midwood does pulled pork right and their N Carolina sauce and S Carolina sauces are spot on.   I could speak extensively about the hushpuppies, mac 'n' cheese, or fries, but instead I will say that I am most pleased by the pickled onion. Genius.  Their barbecue chicken is great too, and as much as I philosophically disagree with Texas brisket, they do that well too.   If you like barbecue, you can't do better in Charlotte than Midwood."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork was incredible! I tasted my fiancé's chicken, it was amazing too! We also enjoyed the bacon wrapped jalapeños! This is, by far, the best BBQ place in town! Plus, friendly staff and comfy atmosphere! Good beer selection! Definitely highly recommend this place, it's delicious food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Edited: thank you Kathy K (Midwood BBQ Bartender) for sharing - made the Watermelon Fresca last night and they were a hit! Still a fan.... Customer service thing. Food is fantastic. I was at Midwood a couple weekends ago and they had a specialty drink cocktail - a Watermelon Fresca. I went back a few days later when family was in town, wanting to share one of our favorite places, and they didn't  have it anymore. I bought a watermelon hoping to make it at home but it just wasn't as good. Called Midwood and a very abrupt person on the phone said they don't give out recipes. Seriously?! It's a specialty cocktail you don't make all the time - it's not like I can come get one if I have the hankering - and you're not going to share? If you gave me the recipe, every time I make it for company, I'd likely say \"I got it at midwood smokehouse and they were so awesome they shared the recipe.\"... like... \"go there and eat... it's one of our favorite places.\" Poor showing, Midwood."}
{"text":"This is just the worst place ever, if your lookin for a bad time and bad food. Because this restarsunt is literally my new favorite thing out of everything in everything. ILL SEE YOU AT MIDWOOD SMOKEHOUSE!!!!! So excited"}
{"text":"Very cool place to eat just outside of main Charlotte downtown area. I has the burnt ends and baked beans. Baked beans are AMAZING! 30 bucks for 2 people including an app. And you can smell it from the parking lot and shops nearby. My wife said the turkey sandwich is the best she ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. I'm from Chicago and I'm always looking for some good ribs and pulled pork. This place has it!! Great service and a good time :) I will definitely come here again for BBQ!"}
{"text":"Very good! We'll be regulars and bring more friends. Wait staff- even the boys-  are friendly and Professional. Music was great tonight -80's. If one of those 5 tv's played something out of their box, like TCM, or comedy channel. Plaza midwood is overloaded with sports bars, they have no personal identity. Plaza middwood is a mixed community! That's the beauty of it. So the culture should follow. Makes it much more interesting. I could offer other suggestions to bring in plentiful sub-groups. I'd like to see it stay around for a while."}
{"text":"I have just eaten one of THE BEST BBQ plates in the 25 years I have lived in this area. Grateful I live in Plaza Midwood but this was at the Ballantyne location. Smokey, flavorful, moist Eastern BBQ. Excellent mac and cheese side. The baked beans were spicy, which I loved. This was a to go order that I was told would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there in 10 and the order was waiting for me. I have also eaten at the P-M location but this was my first BBQ plate. It certainly will not be my last."}
{"text":"Totally legit Q! Great location, though parking can be a pain during peak hours  I recommend the fatty brisket or the pulled chicken BBQ.  Tell them to double you up on the pickled onions. They're like candy. Sweet, earthy candy!  Burnt ends plate is awesome, too. But I recommend you telling them to do the extra sauce on the side.  Their best house sauce (they're all house made, btw) is the sweet habañero sauce. Don't be scared of the habañero part. They did an awesome job of making it where the heat is just right.  Round it all out with the bacon-wrapped jalapeños and the mac&cheez, and you'll be set!  Wait staff is super chill, so that's always a plus."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, but portions are small for prices and the parking is an absolute nightmare. Its a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"We had such a delightful lunch as we were driving through Charlotte on our road trip. The staff were all so unbelievably friendly and accommodating (we were travelling with a dog). They kept bringing him bowls of water and treats, and he loved the attention. The human food was just as delicious as his treats! We got two barbecue plates- one with burnt ends, and one with ribs. We got macaroni and cheese, baked beans, and collard greens for sides. Each of the meals came with hush puppies as well. Literally, everything was just divine. Both the collards and the beans were loaded up with bits of meat, which seems so rare when restaurants usually want to skimp on the good stuff! The hushpuppies were just the slightest bit sweet and were perfect. Our waitress also brought us a variety of BBQ sauces and vinegars to try, and all of them were wonderful. Our waitress was particularly kind when my boyfriend couldn't make up his mind about what kind of beer to get- she brought him samples of a bunch of different types, and gave him recommendations and descriptions of each. We just had the best time ever here. It's a shame we won't be driving through Charlotte again any time soon, because this restaurant was just top notch."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is great!  Enjoyed everything from the loaded potato appetizer and the half fatty/half lean brisket, all the way to the banana pudding.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner today with my wife and kids and really had a nice time and a great meal!!  When we got there, parking was a little tricky..... There was none available in their lot but I was able to park on the street right outside the place.  We were quickly greeted at the door and seated right away.  Our waiter was Matt and he was simply great!!  My wife had the chicken with veggies, we got a pork sandwich for the little one and I got 1/2 rack of ribs with the hush puppies, which were delicious!!  The ribs were top notch with great BBQ sauce!!  The only drawback for me was the men's room.... It had a very strong stench of urine and just wasn't very clean.  But I feel like bathrooms should be both the staff and patron's responsibility to keep clean..... That's just my opinion.  The price was very fair I thought.  The food was very good!!  I would go back!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch twice and even though I wanted to love the place, I can only say that it's okay.  I had the brisket the first time (when they initially opened) and it was dry and hard.  I had the mac and cheese and some other side but they weren't good either.  While I normally find it blasphemous to eat subpar mac and cheese; I figured they were new and needed to adjust so I tried them again. The second time was better.  I had a burger and fries that were good (but they aren't to get right(.  I would eat there again, but they wouldn't be one of my choices as when looking for great food."}
{"text":"My significant other and I have been here three times so far and this past time was the best. The ribs and the hushpuppies are delicious! Also having grown up in the south, I must say their sweet tea is one of the best I've  ever tasted. Service is always great and quick."}
{"text":"The best barbecue in Charlotte. You can't go wrong with the pulled pork, sweet potato fries and bacon-wrapped jalapeños."}
{"text":"Poor service, extremely slow. Our waitress didn't show up until about 15 minutes in, then it took forever for her to bring the food (despite the fact the table of 4 next to us ordered from her about 10 seconds before we did, we didn't get ours (a table of 2) until a good 10 minutes after them). She even said she saw it, but then didn't bring it for another 5 minutes. Before we had gotten our entree she came by and asked if we'd like any desert. Totally clueless.  Now the food. It was just ok. They got the order wrong and messed up the sauces completely. We both had the pulled pork, but neither was very pulled, more like chunked. I shouldn't need a knife to eat pulled pork, but I certainly did. It was also extremely fatty. I had huge pieces of fat and gristle. It was also way oversalted, and this is from two people who like their salt. The fried pickles were just ok, we've had better. They were too soggy. The jalapeno bacon poppers were good, but not outrageous as I was led to believe. The texture was a bit off, and the bacon wasn't crispy. The potato salad was good, as were the hushpuppies. The smoked vegetables were a bit soggy as well, not crispy as you'd expect, but they were ok.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food! I love the mac and cheese, and they have some amazing cocktails.  I'm from Kentucky, and I know my bourbon, and I was impressed by their selection."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Delicious food.  Affordable.  I like the smoked chicken (a half chicken!) with two sides for $10.  Lots of fun.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good bbq! Nice hickory smoked sausage and ribs were.fantastic. We had the combo platter with 4 meats, the small one is plenty for two people."}
{"text":"I'm going to get soooo fat with this place only a few miles from my house!  It's no wonder this place is multi-award winning.  I want everything in my belly!! Service was outstanding, TVs everywhere (there was a Thursday night football game on and I did not miss out!) and the food is fantastic!! Their sauces are not just the normal Carolina vinegar and alternative ketchup based, but they have 4 options, my favorite being the smoked jalapeño awesomeness.  Wings are big and meaty and grilled, so you can pick your bbq.  I had a monster sized salad with shredded pork that lasted for the next day's meal too.   I will be back to make sure I have one of everything on the menu....twice!"}
{"text":"EDIT: So I've been back since my first review. I didn't edit it, because it still wasn't all that great to me.  I got a call from some friends to come out for lunch. \"Sure, where to?\" I asked. \"Midwood,\" they said. \"Ugh. Well, ok,\" I replied. I went back begrudgingly, but with an open mind to try something new. This time I got the Red Neck Cobb. It was lunch, and I didn't want a sandwich or anything too heavy. The salad was a good portion, with plenty of smoked turkey, bacon, and other goodies on top.  Much to my surprise, I really liked the turkey! Just enough smoke flavor, a bit dry, but very tasty nonetheless.  One friend had the special of \"Burnt Edges\" with a Dr. Pepper barbecue sauce. This was very good, too. I could tell it might get to be a bit rich, but again another pleasant surprise.  I will go back again and be more open to trying other items on the menu. --------------------------------------   Hmmm, I wonder if I ate at the same place as the other reviewers?  Took the fam there to try it out. Right away I was excited because the service is great!  I ordered the small bbq plate, with mac & cheese as my side. Well, for $9.95 I expected more. I got a very small portion of bbq, 3 very tiny drops of hush puppies, and an appropriate size of mac & cheese. (Is this the americanization of large portions in me to expect a bit more? Perhaps...) But truly I don't think it mattered. I was unimpressed with the bbq.  Hubs ordered the appetizer wings as his dinner. And he was unimpressed, too. The wings were dry (both in texture and no sauce). I gave him my eastern style bbq sauce to dip them in, and that helped.  However, the surprise dinner we both thought was really good was for the kid - the sloppy joe was really good. (Made with the brisket.)  All in all, I might give it another shot. But only until I see some more yelpers out there saying that the food cost is more reasonable to the portion. And that the bbq has gotten better. Will probably go back for night beers with friends, and maybe some apps (I heard the bacon wrapped jalapenos are good...).  I give the food 2 stars and the service 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I've been to the Original location a lot. We walk in the server was in over her head and there was nobody there. She sat the bigger group that was behind us entering the building before sh sat us... A smaller group. The table she sat us at was avail when we walked in, it took about 7 minutes to get our table. The water they served us had a bad taste. Our meals were not as good as the original location. Burnt Ends & BBQ Plate."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and had stopped by to try the bbq. Had the combo platter with corn, bacon jalepenos and hush puppies. Very nice atmosphere with outdoor seating and a very friendly staff. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of the vinegar based Carolina style bbq. With that said, I thought the bbq here was really good. The brisket and porks ribs were the best. The ribs had a touch of sweetness and all the meats had a decent smoke flavor. The pulled pork was too tangy for me and seemed a bit mushy. Overall worth a stop if you're in town."}
{"text":"I came here because of a recommendation from my boyfriend. Excellent food, excellent service. As soon as we walked in we were politely greeted by the hostess. Although we were told the wait would be 20 minutes, it only ended up being 10! Our waitress was attentive and was helpful in menu decisions. I settled with the Carolina Pork BBQ small plate. It was delicious! The portion was a lot larger than I would have expected. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I have tried this place twice....hoping the second time would be better, but it wasn't.  Both times, servers were less than friendly, were upset if you just felt like drinking iced tea with your lunch, and whatever you do, don't ask for extra bbq sauce - it might not be part of her job description that day.   Ordered tacos - brisket tacos might as well have bee called beef jerky tacos because the meat was dry and there was a sliver of avocado so the bite I took stuck to the roof of my mouth. The Chicken taco was GREAT! The jalepeno in the middle was still very crunchy, but the taco overall was good!  Nachos - not good. The server said it was homemade queso - which apparently translates to melted shredded cheese.  The Chili was good. Good flavor and texture. I like the other restaurants within this group, but this one really let me down.   For good BBQ go to Mac's on South Blvd."}
{"text":"This is only to do with the food not the service - ribs were garbage. Bones breaking off in meat. Lots of fat not a lot of meat. Hard to eat because of bones and fat. From the BBQ I've tried in Nashville, Kansas City, Chicago, Houston / Austin / Dallas and other cities this was not a good showing for Charlotte."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this location but something seems to have changed in the past few months. First the food is always good here. Their burnt ends are my favorite.  The first bad experience the waitress charged my card for more than what was specified and did who knows what with the cash we gave her to go towards the bill. It took 3-4 calls to get a manager to assist me they refunded me the difference but didn't seem that concerned. I just recently visited this past Sunday and was so disappointed. When i ordered my drink it was watered down from where the tea was still warm. This caused it also to be unsweet. My waiter didnt come to check on me as I had just received my meal but couldnt eat it without a beverage. I had to ask the person bringing out drinks to help me. Because of this my food was cold. The waiter had 3-4 tables at the most so I wouldnt expect such horrible service. When i was ready to leave and asked to take my leftover meal home I was given random containers to pack it up on my own. Then when I gave the waiter cash for the bill and told him I would need change. He didnt come back with it and was trying to send me on my way. I had to let him know about the miscommunication which he didnt seem so happy about. I've taken many people out to dinner at this location but really not sure if I want to go back. I left disappointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  The burnt ends were dry and tough. The side of Mac and cheese was barely warm."}
{"text":"Two words....burnt.ends. Cubed pieces of tender brisket vines eat like a luscious piece of braised short ribs. Perfect combination of texture from the crust, softer meat, fat and sauce.   Food: 8.75/10 Atmosphere: 8 Service 7.5  Overall 8/10"}
{"text":"Love midwood smokehouse. We eat there at least once a week, and it is always consistently delicious. The smoked wings are some of the best, and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Tried the smoked wings, pimento cheese fries, moist brisket, ribs, and burnt ends.   The smoked wings have some amazing flavor and goes really well with their bbq sauce. No complaints about the cheese fries.  Moist brisket was the meat I liked best. Ribs and burnt ends were decent but the brisket was the star of the meal. If you've ever had moist brisket from Rudy's in Texas, you'll have no issues devouring the brisket at Midwood.  Service here was great."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, excellent service. GREAT FLAVORS! The Mac n cheese is great as was the bacon wrapped jalapeño.  Probably not cardiologist approved.... If you like BBQ this is a must! The Pecan cobbler was a great way to finish off the meal.  Parking is scarce though."}
{"text":"I hate bbq everything. except mcd's bbq sauce on my fries. Midwood blew me away, I tried things I never thought I would and loved them. Our waitress was super friendly. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue! I love the ribs and the brisket! If your undecided it's best to get the variety \" pig out \" choice on the menu. It gives you four choices of meats and two sides. It a fantastic introduction! Make sure you order dessert too!"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse has almost become a weekly experience for me.  Best BBQ in Charlotte and I would have given it 5 HUGE stars up until a month or so ago. Menu changed but unfortunately so did the portions, consistency and, to a lesser extent, the service. (on one visit... me: \"excuse me the roll for this sandwich is stale.\" server: \" oh, i'm sorry\" *smiling and staring* me: *picking at the insides of my sandwich* \"you might want to tell the kitchen.\" server \"ok.\" *walks away*  aaaand scene.)  For now i'll blame the change and continued growing pains but c'mon MSH let's step it up!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp and I felt after eating here I needed to warn people about this Sub par bbq place because there are so many better options for NC BBQ in the area. Felt like i consumed a salt shaker with sub par service.  Had to stop at a gas station to get water after our meal, i was so thirsty.  Sides were good.  Mac and Cheese, BBQ Baked Beans, Fries, Hushpuppies (although on the small side).  Ribs were meaty but oversalted so there were hard to finish.  Same with the Chopped Pork.  The brisket was fatty.  The only thing that was worthwhile was the sausage.  Don't know why people would wait here to eat because you are better off going somewhere else for BBQ."}
{"text":"I can die happy now. Probably the best BBQ place I've been to so far. A great menu with the most flavorful pork I've ever had. I started with the pimento cheese fries and fell in love. Just make sure you have at least 3 other people with you because this plate is huge. I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the menu here. Whatever you get, I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to Midwood Smokehouse a couple times but I felt my last experience deserved to be reviewed.  To start, the food as always was delicious.  I usually go for the ribs but our server had suggested the burnt ends and they were phenomenal.  Will definitely be ordering them again in the future.  The banana pudding is the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is the music- needs a lot of improvement. They had also ran out of a beer that I wanted but our server, Jennifer, gave me similar options and I ended up picking one I liked even better than my first choice.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable- excellent service and good at her job.  I also appreciate the manager checking in on us to see how we were doing.  Great food and service, just work on the music (type and volume)."}
{"text":"The hostess was horrible. She didn't pay attention to us and seemed like we were disturbing her by requesting a table. She took our phone number down wrong so we never received our text when our table was ready. Other than the initial poor experience, the food was good. We had a little bit of everything. The ribs and chicken were better than the pulled pork, in my opinion. The pork had a plastic after taste. The neighborhood and atmosphere was nice. I'd probably go back, hut the service was a huge turn off for me."}
{"text":"I LOVE Midwood Smokehouse. Everything I have tried has been prepared wonderfully.The salads are fresh and all of their dressings are homemade. I love the Salmon Sammie, grilled cheese,(be sure to add the beef brisket) and of course the sweet potato fries..they are to die for!!!  You can split a half rack of ribs easily with another person, the portion is that big! We come at least once a week and have never left disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cuban sandwich which was very good. The pork that was on the sandwich was smoked well and very tasty! There were a few things I was disappointed in, however, one of which being the habanero barbeque sauce they had. I am a fan of all things spicy, and I was expecting a pretty big kick from the sauce. I was disappointed that the sauce was actually extremely mild with hardly any spice at all. Also, the smoked vegetables were not really that flavorful and had kind of an odd taste to it. All in all, I will definitely come back because I had very few complaints about the place. The jalepenos were also delicious :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic brisket and burnt ends. Love the bacon wrapped jalapeños poppers.  Baked beans very good and nice selection of draft beer."}
{"text":"The brisket at Midwood Smokehouse is the best in Charlotte hands down.  I never had the Q because everytime I come back, I get the brisket!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bbq places in Charlotte. You must get the beef brisket - it is so tender. And I have not had a bad side there yet - really loved the creamed corn and the baked beans!!!"}
{"text":"Of course, the Cuban sandwich and the cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped, jalapenos are a must."}
{"text":"The burnt ends and ribs are always delicious.  The sampler platter is more than enough for sharing and has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte -- and I've had it all! The mac and cheese is incredible, too. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, good stuff. Yes indeed the jalapeño bacon poppers are insanely good. My first bite I thought good then I started thinking about the tastes in my mouth and are most if the appetizer plate. Must have.   I tried the BBQ sandwich and it was delicious. Much smokier than typical eastern vinegar based. Loved it with cole slaw. (The creamy version not the BBQ slaw) yummy.  I has to sample my tables choices as will and the Mac and Cheese is worthy of every 8 year old, the baked beans had a great twist with some tomatoes and a tiny bit of pork and the sweetness was perfect. The curly fries were Fab too.  Add to that a great selection if on tap beer, friendly staff? Quick service and I will be back. Nice job Smokehouse."}
{"text":"I was here recently and not in the mood for meat, so I ordered several of their side items. You can order 4 sides for the cost of $9.  Order was as follows:  Sweet potato fries-cut approximately the size of shoestrings. Lightly salted and a nice mixture of crispy and softly cooked pieces. (I prefer the softly cooked.) There were several in my party, and everyone who sampled them enjoyed them.  Baked beans-flavorful with the tangy sweetness of bbq sauce, and small amounts of meat added in. Not sure what type of meat it was, but it was very tender.   Sweet creamed corn-corn had a nice smoky, peppery flavor, but the cream sauce seemed a little greasy, and the corn was undercooked.  Mac and Cheese-No flavor, just pasta with some cheddar cheese added in. Also had several overcooked bites.  Texas toast-Cost $1.00 extra, and they serve you 4 pieces. It was overcooked, almost to the point of being burnt.  I also received hush puppies with my order, and they were soft, chewy, with a little bit of sweetness, and very good.  Banana pudding-very good, and they serve you a fair amount. I would definitely return just for this!"}
{"text":"Great Carolina BBQ place! First time having Carolina style BBQ and this place was awesome.  Pulled pork - awesome.  Brisket - awesome. St. Louis ribs - awesome.  Hush puppies - F'in awesome! Actually the first time I had them and were so good I ordered an additional side order for dessert.  Definitely look for this place if you are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  We tried the Mac and cheese, baked beans, collard greens, bacon wrapped jalapeños, fat and lean beef brisket and the hush puppies. Good food almighty it was all great.  The collard greens had big chunks of ham hock, the beans were spicy and the Mac & cheese was cooked to perfection. I would recommend going with the lean brisket and not mixed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast and delicious food. Hush puppies and 4 meat combo, nothing was dry, highlights were ribs and fatty brisket.  Baked beans were fantastic too. Rarely fully impressed with BBQ joint but everything here was a winner!"}
{"text":"Not much to say. Great barbecue and great atmosphere. The ribs and burnt ends are highly recommended but I haven't tried anything I don't like. I always walk out satisfied."}
{"text":"The best brisket in Charlotte. Mac & cheese is good as well. The pulled pork is a tad over seasoned but still tasty.   The beer and bourbon selection is very good."}
{"text":"I like their stuff. They have ribs and chop barbeque that I like. I know I will have a great meal whenever I go there. And neatless to say I go there about ones a week."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot off BBQ in a lot of places and this is amazing.  Nice smoke to it, seasoned perfect, now drowned out in sauce...you add the amount you want."}
{"text":"We are longtime fans of Midwood Smokehouse. Consistently good food and great cocktails. But I have to give a special compliment to the current waitstaff. Last night we had a great server- funny, efficient, and had some great ordering suggestions (plus, she knew the beer list so well!)- but the server at the table next to us should win some kind of medal. An older, disabled lady was dining alone and had a large number of take out boxes. Her server offered to help by taking the lady's boxes out to her car for her and met her at the door with the car keys. I was really moved. Nice job, Midwood Smokehouse!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite bbq place in Charlotte, but the last several times the pork has been very fatty. Sorry Midwood, Mac's and Queen City Q have you beat. P.S. 3-stars because the beef brisket is very tasty."}
{"text":"So me and my friend are BBQ lovers and we wanted to try out this place.    First off, finding the place was a little tricky and the parking can be a hassle as well. We went on a Friday night and it was not too crowded. We sat at the bar area because we did not want to wait for a table and the aroma was making me hungry!  We ordered the fried pickles and the smoked wings for an appetizer. The fried pickles were good. Not the best in Charlotte, but good. The smoked wings however were great and had some flavor to them. We got a combo platter to share because we wanted to try everything. We got the smoked turkey, pork ribs, pulled pork, and the brisket with 2 sides. The sides we got were the mac n cheese and fries. OMG!!! Everything on that plate was fantastic and we had no complaints at all.   I can't speak for her, but I know I will be coming back here again. Especially for those yummy flavorful ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  This place has awesome BBQ.  It's really busy all the time so I recommend getting there early.  The portions are way to big but you get to try everything.  The pimento cheese fries rock and you don't need the meat on them unless you want to into a food coma before dinner.  I was surprised that the brisket was so well cooked.  They obviously take their time making it because it's really tender.  They have a large beer selection supporting the local Charlotte breweries among others.    Service was fast and they have a knowledgeable wait staff.  I also have ordered their bulk to-go food for parties and was not disappointed except for the kitchen manager who was kind of a jerk on the phone."}
{"text":"This is the best brisket I've had in Charlotte.  I got a lean portion and it was juicy and flavorful and cooked to perfection.  My family was with me and said the pulled pork BBQ was the best they've ever had.  My Dad wanted to go there every night they were in town.  The sides were decent - I had potato salad and cole slaw.  The mac and cheese was supposedly pretty good.  The hush puppies were pretty awesome.  Table service was great.  We sat at a booth, which was comfortable.  They also had some high tops.  Four stars only because parking sucks.  The lot is way too small and you have to find another place to park if the lot is full."}
{"text":"Yummers.  This place was recommended by a few people I know who have been to Charlotte so we decided to check it out during our visit and it did not disappoint.  Hubs got a pork BBQ sandwich with fries and BBQ beans. I got the pulled chicken sandwich with sweet fries. The chicken had a mustard BBQ sauce which went well with the chicken and the fries were perfectly crisp and warm.  Overall a solid BBQ joint with excellent prices and very personable staff and service."}
{"text":"Had the brisket for lunch.  I was told it smoked for 16 hours and I believe it! The meat had great flavor and melted in my mouth, no need to saturate it with sauce.  Inside or patio seating available, nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Love the food. This is my new barbecue place- sorry Mac's. Usually the side items at any place are ok, but the beans, bacon wrapped jalepenos are awesome."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is the bomb!  No sauce required, it's moist tender and just plain delicious.  I still put sauce on though, just because sauce is the boss!   Beer specials on Friday or Saturday would be good, but I understand why they don't have them.   It's not exactly a budget friendly place with $12 plates and $4 beers, but it's totally worth it!  From burnt ends to BBQ to bacon wrapped jalapeños, it's all good here! Make sure to check in early or you'll get stuck with quite a wait...but hey if you do, just drink awesome beer. +1 to the music too, just my style with all the classic rock!"}
{"text":"One of the best bbq joints in Charlotte. I had the bbq sandwich...simply amazing. Fries and fried pickles were good too. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Great 'Cue + Ambiance + Killer Service = Feeling REAAAL Good. (Bloated, but real good bloated!)  After spending 3 years living in the Kansas City, eating some of the BEST BBQ in the country, it's pretty hard to stack up to a Gates or Jack Stack's (5 Stars IMO) but the service and ambiance really bump this place up to 5 stars for me.   My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday, when it was packed. Even so, we were seated quickly, and had our unsweetened iced teas on the table within 2 minutes.  Our server gave us some recommendations-- but I would have liked if she \"sold\" some of her favorites better.  (The chicken salad is good...the chili is our special of the day...I like the mustard sauce.)   What our server did do, was offer us options.  My husband wanted a pork and brisket sandwich, but since it wasn't on the menu, our server said he could get the brisket, and add a $3 side of pulled pork, and she'd give us a buttered bun.    Our server recommended the chicken salad so I got that on lettuce leaves, roasted corn, tomatoes, red onion, cheese and orange honey mustard on the side.  The chicken salad is good, no doubt, but didn't have the smoky flavor I was hoping for.  If this wasn't at a BBQ joint, it would be A+.   When our server learned we were 1st timers, she brought us samples of each of the house sauces.  A mustard based one (sweet and thick, really nice), a hot and spicy tomato-based, a regular tomato-base and a Carolina vinegar based.) Alongside were 4 hushpuppies for dipping.  We appreciated this and were able to decide which one we wanted with our meats.   The real star...  Frank, the owner came over to us, and we started chatting.  When he learned we were first timers at his restaurant, and that we were from KC, immediately offered to bring us two of his ribs to try.  He explained how he smokes his meats everyday, (unlike Mac's Speedshop, where the meat is smoked somewhere else and then brought in...I was not surprised) and only used hickory wood to smoke.    The ribs were tender and fell off the bone.  The outside is extra seasoned and some would say salty, but to me, it was perfect.  All that spice and salt permeated the outside and helped seal in the juices of the meat.  Tender, moist...didn't need sauce.   My macaroni and cheese side was good-- as were the sweet potato fries.   The BRISKET was unreal.  You can pick lean, fatty, or both, and I recommend getting the \"both\" option. Tender, juicy, nice browned bits from the outside. LOVE.   Note: They have crushed ice here-- bonus!  $2 small banana pudding super creamy-- wafer cookies IN the pudding and on top.  NOT YELLOW. Delish.   Overall, the casual, but rich, warm interior and mirrored bar area really made us feel welcome.  Nice patio area too. Lots of drink specials daily.   Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Visited here around dinner hours and it wasn't too busy.  Ordered the fried pickles and they were actually the best that I had eaten in quite some time.  Wife wanted a mix drink and she ordered a Mai Tai.  Big mistake, the bartender wasn't at all experienced.  The waiter brought a small shaker glass full of this blue mess.  It tasted as if they just poured the two rums in a glass and sent it on its way.  I asked the waiter to take it back and put it in a bigger glass with some pineapple and orange juice.  When it came back it was sour and did not taste at all like a drink should be.  Told the waiter it wasn't good at all and he did nothing about it. My wife ordered the BBQ sandwich with slaw and hush puppies.  I ordered the small chopped plate with fries and the plate had some kind of onions soaked in vinegar and hush puppies.  This place had to have the worst BBQ that I have ever eaten.  The BBQ was mushy and just didn't taste right at all.  The hush puppies seemed doughy and the fries and slaw were actually good. The atmosphere of the place was cheerful and upbeat.  The staff was super nice.  Too bad the food wasn't all that good."}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews and I must say I agree with the ratings.   I had the traditional pulled pork and was very pleased. Very little fat and the taste was great. The sweet potato fries were the perfect side.   Service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and our meals came out really fast, especially considering that we were here at 12 noon."}
{"text":"What a refreshing modern take on barbecue!  The decor, music and drinks were fabulous. The premium sides could use some special attention, but overall the food was satisfying.  I would definitely return for round 2:)."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmm good! Edges out Macs (also a fav). We've been here 3 times now and each time was fan-tas-tic!"}
{"text":"After having been to city smoke, mckoys, mac's and saucepan's, this place is by far the best. The grilled veggies are delicious and I love the combo plates you can get with different meats and sides. The bar area with high top tables are a nice edition because you can catch a game during dinner. No complaints about service or quality of the food! Only downside is parking is a little scarce during peak hours."}
{"text":"I am a pescatarian and also have a weird wheat allergy so basically I'm an extremely difficult person to eat with. My husband eats all the things and especially adores ribs and any BBQ. I was initially very hesitant to eat here as the only thing I can get is the salmon with a side of veggies and that can get boring. I was wrong. We eat here all the time, I'd probably eat their salmon every night if I could. It's alarmingly good. I mean possibly the best salmon I've ever had good. And according to my husband every other thing on the menu is also amazing.  The service is consistently great. Once we had an obviously new and overwhelmed server on a busy night, she kept forgetting things and we felt bad for her, and instead of getting angry the manager and other servers just pitched in and were extra friendly. It's always great to see supportive coworkers and customers who are so thrilled with their food that they don't get all rude and complain-y about some occasional mishaps. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Midwood smokehouse is a welcomed new addition to the neighborhood.  They have awesome beer specials every day during the week that go great with whatever 'cue you order.  I had the Texas style brisket yesterday and it was to die for.  No knife necessary, most tender brisket I've ever eaten at a barbecue joint.  The bacon wrapped jalepenos are delicious.  The first time I had them they were very spicy ad second time not as much. (I preferred the spicier version).  Smoked vegetable special was divine--portabellas, squash, onion, and more cooked in their custom made smoker to perfection.  The smoke flavor brought out the meatiness in the fresh veggies without overwhelming them.  Will definitely be visiting Midwood Smokehouse regularly.  Brisket is a must."}
{"text":"I have been to Midwood 4 times so far and the previous three experiences have been excellent.  Unfortunately, I went  last night with a table of four and the service was not up to par.    We elected to sit outside instead of wait on a table inside.  We ended up waiting anyway because no one greeted us for 15 minutes.  As a server I understand sometimes when its busy you may be unaware that you have been sat so I went inside to inform the hostess we had yet to be greeted.  Our server (Jessica, I believe) then showed up and took drink orders.  I asked if there were any specials and she said no.  (I found out as I left that there were $5 vodka drinks on special.)  After she tried to push appetizers we ordered our meals.  A food runner brought them out to us and my order was wrong.  He walked away while another runner brought out the second two orders which were correct.  My order was brought back out and the runner claimed the correct side item would follow.  Another side was brought but it too was wrong and he left so quickly I was unable to tell him so.  The entire time our server did not check on us once.  My boyfriend had to leave the table, track her down and ask again for the correct side along with some extra sauce (she did not ask what sauce he wanted with his pulled pork to begin with.)   When she finally returned with the correct items (without a single apology) I was nearly done with my main dish.  Don't get me wrong; I don't expect a barbecue place to be fine dining.  However I do expect prompt, courteous service in any restaurant and unfortunately, this time around I did not get either.  I will return though;  that pulled pork is too good to pass up!  Hopefully next time the service will match their food."}
{"text":"Just an update to my previous review:  I'm not certain if they changed the brisket sandwich for good...but it's now on a toasted bread with much less blue cheese.  Very good!  I also feel the need to mention the Cuban.  I imagine that many people overlook something like a Cuban sandwich while at a barbecue joint.  I too, tend to be one of those people...until now.  I am truly thankful, that I can so easily step outside of my box. But...now I feel like I'm going to be stuck for a while.  The Cuban sandwich is SO good.  I mean...really, really good!  P.S.  Did I mention how good the Cuban is?   Try:  Really??  Avoid:  Not trying some sweet potato fries for your side...very nice"}
{"text":"I had the combination platter so I can say it with confidence: everything is good! The brisket is insanely juicy and the sausage has just the right spice. Everything has a strong, distinctive hickory flavor, just the way it's supposed to be. On top of that, they have a nice selection of local beer and Chad the barman knows his stuff. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Another reviewer claimed this is not AUTHENTIC NC BBQ, he's right. Real hickory smoked pork BBQ is almost impossible to find, both in NC and SC! I've made trips to nationally rated BBQ joints in both states, Sweatman's, Scott's, BBQ King and Lexington, among others. None are close to Midwood to me. If you don't like smoked meats then this is not the place for you. But if you do, you won't find any better. Moist and tasty, don't ruin this by putting sauce on it. Kudos to Hayley, an excellent waitress on two occasions I have been. To management, make a trip to Pit BBQ in Griffin Ga for some outstanding Brunswick Stew. You would make a killing as a side here in Charlotte. And gluten free, please."}
{"text":"Over-rated . Noisy. Mediocre service.  The chicken and ribs were dried out and not hot enough. My wife's burger was over cooked and tasteless. But the smoked veggies were excellent.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ and service! We were in from out of town and looking for a good place to eat. We chose Midwood based upon other reviews and were not disappointed. The smoked salmon was cooked to perfection and the smoked meats were extra smoky - deliciously infused with hickory. The collard greens are a must too!  Be sure to say hi to EC too!"}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork tacos, brisket and ribs. Collards and mac n cheese were great as well. Service was excellent. We were in town from TN doing some shopping and stopped here because of the excellent reviews. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I was impressed with Midwood before I even arrived, their wide ranging menu features lots of options, including some unique items like pimento cheese fries and bacon wrapped jalapenos. The experience did not disappoint. Patrons are seated by the hostess and it's a full service dining experience. I was really hungry - I ordered the large Carolina pork plate and a pound of smoked wings. The plate was a good deal with generous portion size for $13+tax. The smoked wings didn't seem like quite as good of a value at $8+tax, but still an ok deal. Everything was served piping hot. The hushpuppies were a bit tough. The mac and cheese was spectacular, great flavor. I tried their smoked vegetables (squash, zucchini, peppers) which had good flavor/seasoning, and are a nice option to offer. The pulled pork was juicy with very little fat. The vinegar based sauce did not add much flavor to the meat, but I don't think it needed sauce to dress it up, seemed good as is. The wings were ok, the BBQ sauce on them seemed to be different from the sauce on the table, more tomato based and did have a slight bit of a peppery kick. I'd like to try them again with the ranch instead. I topped it off with the pecan cobbler with ice cream, which is probably a little overpriced at $5.50+tax. The pecans were a little over-cooked for my taste, it seemed like too much of a burnt flavor.   This place was hopping during the middle of dinner time on a weekday night. Their outdoor seating was comfortable given the pleasant temperature during my visit. I definitely want to come back and try out some of their other menu options."}
{"text":"We had family night here Monday night. Our waiter Andrew was awesome. He recommended pull pork, and tacos. Which was delicious.  All the food we tasted was good. Thank you Andrew!  The manager recommend \"banana pudding \" yo this is soooooo good. If u come here please try their banana pudding and their pull pork.    This is my family new spot when we are in Charlotte nc."}
{"text":"So, finally made it here to eat their famous barbeque.  There are limited choices for me because I have celiac disease. I wish they would work on their menu  for those of us. I did try the barbeque , and it was delicious. Great atmosphere and definitely go for the drinks !!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant. I came here on a friend's recommendation and I was not disappointed! The staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was great!  We started off with the Queso cheese appetizer and we added brisket to it. This was the first time I had meat with Queso and it was great! I ordered the large sized BBQ Pulled Chicken with BBQ coleslaw, and sweet potato fries, the meal comes with hush puppies and sweet onions on the side. The meal ready by the time we were through with our appetizers. I was definitely full by the time was done!  They have tv's throughout with ESPN on, so I'll definitely be back here for the games."}
{"text":"1st time here today. OUTSTANDING. The food and service was some of the absolute best since moving here a year ago.  Paul S. our friend for the night was nothing short of amazing. Attentive and so polite, I never felt hovered over or uncomfortable. He was genuinely happy to help.  We had pulled pork nachos, pulled chicken sandwich with slaw and hushpuppies, and a chicken bacon sandwich. I could have eaten it all with my eyes alone. So glad to have used my mouth instead!   Hushpuppies were hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. We had freshly cooked tortilla chips with that DELICIOUS dip of nacho sauce and tender pulled pork. The slaw and mustard sauce that came with my sandwich were seriously good enough to eat on their own.   I will ABSOLUTELY come back with my friends and family when they visit. The service and choice of drink specials kept me intrigued enough to do so. Thanks so much to the hostess and Paul today!"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse was good! I went there with two friends a few Fridays ago. We ordered fried pickles and a wing special for appetizer. We also ordered bourbon slush (not quite sure of the name) drinks. OMG drinks were so delicious! I didn't try the wings, but the fried pickles were good.  For dinner I had the brisket (I ordered 'both' - fatty and lean). Brisket was SO good. My friends ordered the BBQ chicken and the pulled pork. The pork was a bit disappointing, not sure if it was the sauce we didn't like but it just tasted a little off. The chicken was good, but the real standout was the brisket - I'd definitely recommend that. We wanted to try to the banana pudding but we were so full after all of the food. So, we will have to return for some pudding and ribs!"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious, service was prompt and friendly, and portions were enormous. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my brother.  They really wanted to take us for Carolina BBQ, so Midwood was the place.  Great atmosphere.  Before we even opened up our menus, our waitress told usbtheyvwere out of ribs.  For me, no big deal, I don't like them.  But a BBQ place with no ribs,  at 7pm on a weekend evening?  I ordered the brisket dinner.  It came with hush puppies and I got mac and cheese and the bacon wrapped jalapenos.   The food was amazing.  My brother who was disappointed there were no ribs, got tacos.  One of each type, brisket, pork and chicken I think, and he loved them all. Also ordered was the BBQ Burnt Ends and the Pulled Pork sandwich both of which were enjoyed.  Food was served quickly, but we never felt rushed.  We will be back next time I'm in town.  4 stars just because of the ribs."}
{"text":"This place serves it right when its gone its gone for the day.  This bbq comes straight from that days smoke as real as it can be.  You want ribs better be there before 7:00 they had 73 slabs when I ordered they were down to 18 for the day.  Now about the food ribs have a great bite, burnt ends tossed in a beer bbq sauce ununbelievably delicious. Jalapeno bacon wrapped poppers rock and the pecan cobler with vanilla is a sweet sensation.  Great selection of local and national crafted brew.  Come with family or friends the staff is great as much as the atmosphere.  Thanks Richie, Midwood will be a must and a goto landmark for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great bbq and the sides are incredible!  There's something for everyone and a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Charlotte hands down. The portions are huge and the service is usually pretty quick. I wish they had a sweet BBQ sauce but I can go to Sonny's to get my fix for that. Never had anything I didn't enjoy here!"}
{"text":"I went there with my husband and son, after my husband was at the original Midwood Smokehouse in Plaza Midwood and thought it was great.  To be honest the meal was OK nothing over the moon.  My husband told me I have to try their other location."}
{"text":"Awesome! Delicious, best barbecue in the south! Amanda, best waitress You will love all the meats but the hush puppies, Cole slaw are fantastic. Please open one in Greensboro!"}
{"text":"Had beef brisket and Burnt ends very very good for both. Save room for the pecan  cobbler a must! We have never had poor service here all servers are friendly and know the menu well.  Only suggestion is they should give a basket of hushpuppies to you when you sit down that is the sign of a true Bar B que joint."}
{"text":"Best brisket in Charlotte - no sauce require....  but the Midwood sauce is great. And I love that the baked beans are more like chili than anything else."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte and had my second try at NC BBQ. Turns out Midwood smokehouse is in my backyard, which in turn happens to be extremely dangerous for a BBQ nut like myself. The food was incredible. The chili was smoky and not overpoweringly spicy. The wings (both the menu ones and a garlic buffalo special) were incredible. 2 very different flavors and textures, but 2 very successful, meaty sets of wings. Finally, the pulled pork was delicious. I'm from up north so the whole vinegar style sauce is new to me. This place made me a real fan of it!  On top of the food, the vibe and decor is fantastic. Everyone was extremely friendly and thanked us for stopping in. They made you feel like a part of the neighborhood and that we were doing them a favor...when in fact they did me and my stomach a huge favor! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'd heard mixed reviews about this place, but being a huge fan of BBQ, I figured I'd try it myself. The first thing that jumped out at me was the Bacon-wrapped Jalapenos. The same company does this app at Paco's Tacos and Tequila in South Park, the difference being that at Midwood, they remove the seeds, so that you may actually enjoy the flavor. The bacon was on the chewy side, but the flavor was right. Then again, it seems hard to mess up anything w/ Bacon, Cheese, and Jalapenos. Being of small frame, I thought it best to jump right into their \"North Carolina BBQ\" before I filled up on apps. I must say, it was very,very good. I opted for the vinegar based sauce, but there are other options. Honestly, it didn't need sauce, it was done properly. That is to say, it really is authentic, slow smoked BBQ. As far as ambiance, service, and all the other fixins, I'll just say, It's a BBQ joint, I didn't expect much, and was not disappointed. I have been back, and will go again."}
{"text":"I had the baked chicken and it was okay. The food was alright but I truly didn't understand the hype. I would definitely try it again but this time I would try a different meal. Again the baked chicken was okay, a little dry and not flavorful. For sides I had the hush puppies, collard greens and mac and cheese. The sweet tea was alright. They didn't have enough variety in sauces. I like more sweet sauces and I didn't find anything that I liked."}
{"text":"Brisket here is amazeballs. Love their pickled onions and the bacon wrapped jalapenos. They used to have this brisket chili that was the best chili I've ever had and they took that off the menu. WHY?!  It really made me sad. I'm still sad about it actually."}
{"text":"Dare I say it? Midwood Smokehouse has the best barbecue I've had inside Charlotte's city limits.  I know, I know, that's not a bold claim to make, but the barbecue here is seriously good. This is four-star barbecue, my friends. The pulled pork is tender and juicy, although I think a lot of that juice comes from the vinegar sauce it's dunked in. In addition to a vinegar-based sauce, there's also a mustard-based sauce and a more traditional KC-style sauce, which are all pretty solid.  But as good as the barbecue is (and, trust me, it's pretty damn good), the real stars here are in the other parts of the menu. The smokehouse veggies are as good as veggies cooked for hours in a smoker should be. The macaroni and cheese is the real stuff with the crust on top and lots of cheesy goodness. And the chopped salad? Could be one of my favorite salads in Charlotte. Tons of fresh veggies including smoked corn cut off the cob. Let me say that again. SMOKED CORN CUT OFF THE COB.  But there are two things that bump this up from a four-star, solid barbecue joint review, into OH-EM-GEE, THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF: The pimento cheese fries and the Kentucky Slush Puppy.  The pimento cheese fries are just what you'd expect -- crinkle-cut fries smothered with melted pimento cheese, a mound of pulled pork and just enough green onion for some bite. Yes, this will give me a heart attack, but it will be worth it.  And the Kentucky Slush Puppy is a grownup slurpee made with lemonade and bourbon. Yes, that's right. A bourbon slurpee. Thank you, Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Best bbq I have ever had. Been searching for something comparable ever since I've been here with no luck."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, sides and love the hush puppies that come with the dinner as well. I have been to this location twice visiting in the area and brought 2 sets of families and they both loved it!"}
{"text":"I was going to go with 4 stars for this place, because the food is really good, but the wait staff is also spectacular, so that pushed it over the top.  I first tried this place on a whim, and took my whole family for my Dad's birthday. That's seven adults who went, plus a baby and a four year old that can't sit still. Our waitress was patient and prompt, and light-hearted about the whole thing (sometimes the people I love can be difficult customers :) )  I got the whole mix of tacos, and every one was mouthwatering. The coleslaw and hush puppies were divine.   This is my go-to place for BBQ in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times now.... the first two were very good. However my last visit was not so good.   The waiter Brian was anything but attentive. The large version of the burnt ends arrived cold. I  finally was able to grab a manager to send it back to be heated as Brian was no where in site. I ordered coffee with cream and he never asked if I wanted a refill... nor did he ever bring the cream I asked him for three times. And he never checked on us or asked if everything was alright until the end of the meal.   The bottom line.... the food is always tasty (when hot) but the service on this trip was simply horrid. I'm not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Visited the new Ballantyne location of Midwood Smokehouse yesterday for lunch. I was by myself and figured the location would be insanely crowded, but decided to walk in to see.  I've tried to talk my husband into going, but he's always adamant that he likes to give new restaurants \"a month or so\" to work out any kinks before he tries them. Since he was off doing something else for the afternoon, it was my chance to try it without him.  The restaurant was busy, but there was no wait and there were seats available at the bar. I grabbed a chair and ordered a PBR ($2.50 drafts!) and after a brief review of the menu, figured I'd try the side dishes/veggie combination plate instead of going for actual barbecue on this visit. I figure this way my husband can't get TOO upset that I went without him for my first visit!   I ordered the creamed corn, cole slaw and stuffed jalapenos. I was originally going to get hushpuppies as one of the items but Chad, the bartender, assured me my dish would come with a few since the platter of sides was considered a \"plate\". When it came out devoid of hushpuppies he noticed instantly and said to the foodrunner,  \"We're going to need a side of hushpuppies and pickled onions for that.\" They were delivered right away. Thanks for having my back, Chad!  The creamed corn was delicious. I chose to believe it was \"healthy\" in spite of the clear abundance of well, cream, in the dish. I was least enthusiastic for the coleslaw, but it ended up being my favorite item on the plate! The 3 jalapenos were delicious, but a little small. I'm used to a friend's bacon-wrapped jalapenos which are not halved, and are enormous.   Some people have written that they find the hush puppies too sweet. I find them to be just perfect, no ketchup needed to enjoy! I also loved the pickled onions. I devoured everything on my plate quickly, and found it to be just the right amount of food. I've never had a chance to try all the delicious sides I've wanted, so this was a great opportunity.  Chad made me feel welcome and was very attentive, getting me a second PBR just before mine went empty. We shared some Words with Friends strategy during a moment of downtime, as he saw I was playing on my phone.  I was very impressed just watching Chad work. He handled a few carry out orders, and as each one showed up, he opened up all the containers to quality check them, and went back for a few items with each one. This restaurant, being so new, probably still has a little confusion going on, but he made sure every order was right, whether it was mine or the carryout orders.  All told, my bill was $12.99 for a delicious meal and 2 PBR's. The value for what I received can't be beat!  I was originally thinking I might be uncomfortable eating solo at what is so clearly a sit down family restaurant, but the bartenders were all very friendly, and it was such an enjoyable lunch I definitely see swinging by for more solo lunches in the future!"}
{"text":"This place does not feel special. The Bloody Mary was not that good it was missing flavor and it came out of a bottle. The burnt ends were inconsistent. The bacon wrapped jalapeños were good. The baba sauce on the burnt ends was was solid throughout I would buy just the sauce. I don't think I need to come back here though to many other places to try."}
{"text":"I'm a native Texan and I have to say these Carolina boys know their way around a brisket I'm impressed."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a go-to BBQ place in Charlotte for a while, but no more.  Everything here is fantastic, but I loved the pulled chicken with their mustard BBQ sauce.  I could take a bath in that stuff.  So good.  Go get yourself some."}
{"text":"One of the better places for BBQ in town. I always try to visit when in town and take many a business associate to try the local offerings. The food is plenty, the service fast and attentive, the prices reasonable, and the BBQ is good. Even off BBQ items like Salmon, and Salads are very tasty."}
{"text":"this is on my top 5 bbq joints in charlotte. I like the rubs and sauce they provide. I haven't tried everything on the menu but enough to fall in love with it. pulled pork sandwich with slaw is my fav so far. Parking can be a hassle but thats plaza/midwood for yah."}
{"text":"The nachos libre and Cuban sandwich were both great! The Spiced Boody Mary was perfect! Our service was great! Wish I had gone sooner."}
{"text":"YUM. So glad we stopped by while we were in town. I had the Texas style brisket sandwich with cheddar  and Mac and cheese and my PIC had the burnt ends with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious, great flavor, cooked perfectly, awesomeness. Great atmosphere too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best BBq I have had. I've been to other states but NC was where I found mid wood smokehouse . Had the brisket, ribs and pulled pork and all were amazing. they even give you fat option on the brisket."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!!! The brisket melted in your mouth!!! The burnt ends was fabulous!!! So much flavor and the staff was so friendly! Would definitely recommend this place to friends!!! The portions were a good size too!"}
{"text":"Stick to the PM location. Here you'll get lower quality service and food with noticeably smaller portions"}
{"text":"Excellent ribs, B-B-Q pork, Mac-n-cheese and hush puppies.  Picked up all those things for some visiting \"Northeners\" and everyone went home very happy.  I even got to enjoy some leftovers the next day and things.  Great location, food and service.  Will go back after I burn off all those carbs."}
{"text":"When I want really good ribs close by, these are my go to. Fall off the bone tender and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant with terrific staff, wonderful food, and a great atmosphere, all for the right price.  I took my family here (small kids included) and everyone came away stuffed to the rafters and eagerly wanting to not only come back, but recommend it to everyone else we know.  If you like barbecue, it's a must visit!"}
{"text":"Love Midwood! All of the food is great, the environment rocks and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"100% better than Mac's Speedshop. The best option for two people or more are the feast platters. I would suggest the collard greens as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We had the combo platter with 2 sides (Pig Out size). Split between 3 people and it was perfect! I dont live in NC, but if I'm ever back, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place that served brisket in the area that had good reviews.  This place was a HOMERUN!!!!  Doc, the bartender was very kind, along with the rest of the staff working.  And the Brisket was right on point!!!  They even give you a choice of lean or fatty style! (you can go half and half too!).  Looking forward to going back with friends.  Well done Midwood!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here yesterday, KILLER Q!!!! Is it as good as Lexington # 1, the world capital of bar b q? Well, i wouldn't go that far however, if you are looking for high quality Q in the city, this is THE PLACE, no doubt."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great as well. Turns out that I got a little food poisoning later in the night however. May have just been an unlucky batch of the Carolina pork."}
{"text":"The beef brisket is the best I've had in Charlotte.  You can order fatty, lean or both.  I ordered a combination of the two but next time it's 'diet be damned' as I'm ordering all fatty. Oh my goodness - very tender and flavorful with a large enough portion that you'll be all but begging for a doggie bag.  Service was on point.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great service, great food. I had the brisket (fatty, not lean!), sausage, sweet potato fries, baked beans. Brisket was awesome, but everything was good.  Waitress (Erin) was excellent.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, quality food and friendly staff. I highly recommend their food! Consistently delicious food that will not let you down. If you're wanting something specific call to make sure they have not run out because that does happen from time to time."}
{"text":"A great addition to South Charlotte.  Excellent food.  The pork is eastern NC style, which is not my preference, but everything else is so good. There are not many places that serve burnt ends, and it's worth going to Midwood just for that. Their smoked wings are really good, and the banana pudding is delicious.  The only problem is that it gets crowded and there is a wait during peak hours, but what else would you expect?"}
{"text":"Went to the new location last week which was their first week open. For only being open a few days, the food was INCREDIBLE and the service was wonderful! The prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous. Diverse menu with plenty of options to choose from. Huge selection of craft beers!    I ordered the pulled pork, which came with hush puppies (delicious) and a side item, I chose the delicious macaroni and cheese (seriously some of the best I've ever had). The people I went with ordered the salmon sammie with a side of greens, and the brisket with a side of sweet potato fries. For dessert we ordered the banana pudding which was the best I've ever had!! Everyone was more than happy with the quality of the food, the portion size, price, and great service. Definitely make a point to go here!!"}
{"text":"The food was as good as the original restaurant on Central. I had the BBQ (burnt ends) with hush puppies, collard greens, and sweet potato fries. Our waitress was helpful to explain the different BBQ sauces. My wife had a salad, and macaroni and cheese (and shared some of my sides). There was also a good selection of draft beer. There was an issue with the taste of her salad, and our waitress changed it out to a regular salad. The manager came over twice to ask if we needed anything, and he wanted to make sure we were okay. Great service; makes you feel taken cared of! We enjoyed our visit, and will return."}
{"text":"Decided to add this place to our have tried list for BBQ  I personally think there flavor is a little to smokey for my liking ...the smokiest tasting anything I've ever tried ..I will say that they do have the BBQ nachos that are awesome ...cool divey  decor kinda biker bar ish cool place I thought ...."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte and found this place on Yelp.  I'm glad we did!  The food was great and our server Ashley was very helpful explaining what options we had.  My wife and I split the combo plate which included (moo, cluck and oink) brisket, pulled chicken, ribs and chopped pork.  We chose bbq beans and coleslaw for our sides.  We had plenty to eat and took the rest home for another meal all for $21!  The chicken with the mustard sauce was my favorite."}
{"text":"My first experience wasn't a very positive one. Meals were cold, service was slow. We ordered the popular bacon wrapped jalapeños and they were extremely cold and soggy, not good at all. The only upside to our visit was the manager on duty was very understanding and took off the plates that were cold. We were very excited to try this as we saw many positive reviews, sadly we will not be returning. Def not the best BBQ."}
{"text":"We started with the palmetto fries which were great. The beef brisket is the best I've had. We ordered a combination of the two both the pulled pork and brisket was very tender and flavorful with a large portion .  We'll be back! We need to try everything."}
{"text":"So good..you really can't go wrong with the brisket or the pulled pork.  Also, bacon wrapped Jalapenos..awesome. Nice beer selection too, which you can't be mad at."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to Midwood Smokehouse, and we will definitely be back. In addition to the menu items and specials, they were offering \"add-ons\" so we were able to try additional meats with our meals. The crispy St Louis ribs were our favorite, but the stockyard tacos, burnt brisket ends, burnt pork ends, sausage, mac & cheese, and creamy coleslaw were all delicious. Our server, Bridgett, was wonderful, and all the staff were attentive and helpful. My only regret is that none of the food was actually HOT when it was served, but it was still very tasty. That's the reason for only 4 stars; otherwise, it would be 5."}
{"text":"Nothing special... Side items were good, but ribs were blah! I wouldn't make this a regular place.."}
{"text":"We come to this place often and we enjoy there Bbq. My wife and I always order the hush puppies and they are great. I had the chopped pork which is good and the BBQ beans are great. My wife order the chopped salad with BBQ chicken on it. She enjoys that salad but says it was just ok this time. The large salad is very big so be ready to eat a lot if you order it."}
{"text":"Super yummy!!! I had the combo - ribs, brisket, pulled pork and sausage - ALL super flavorful and juicy meats. Sweet potato fries and smoked veggies are pretty on point too.  I love the outside seating & the street art on the back."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss but I am giving it 4 stars solely based off the bacon wrapped jalepenos.  These bad boys are probably one of my favorite things to eat ever.  Wings are hit or miss and often cold (are very good when they are actually warm because of the unique smokiness).   The tacos are surprisingly good (especially the one with the bacon wrapped jalepeno!).  They usually have good beer specials and service is good.  Parking can be a pain because of all the construction."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the BBQ here - so smoky and delicious! My dad and I agreed that it was great. My grandfather was a fan of the baked beans and I liked the flavor of the smoked vegetables. The fries and hushpuppies were pretty standard and the unsweet tea was a bit weak. The server was kind and patient and struck a good balance between not checking on us every minute and not ignoring us completely. In short: very pleasant experience and yummy BBQ. If you want to avoid the crowd, Thursday at 5 pm was pretty quiet!"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq our waiter Matt was one of the best waiters I've ever had.  Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was born and bred on pure Kansas City BBQ, so I'm trying not to let that bias me. Too much, at least.  With that being said, I'm a huge fan of BBQ either way and HAD to try some Carolina 'cue while I was out here. After some debate, we went Midwood since neither Kenzie K. or I had been here. Burnt ends were a little dry, and I had much higher expectations for the Fat Tire sauce (which I could barely taste). The Carolina Pork sandwich wasn't bad, and I'm glad that we at least were able to get samples of all of their sauces to try with it. Echoing what Kenzie said, the sides were a bit disappointing, especially the dry mac and cheese, and bottles of sauce would have been nice/preferred.  I wish I'd been visiting longer so I could have had some more meals to really develop an opinion on Carolina BBQ beyond Midwood. I'm optimistic for my next trip back and subsequent BBQ trials..."}
{"text":"This place had great food and a plentiful supply of local craft beer- how can you go wrong?!  I had a special turkey sandwich.  Service was nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"First off if anyone thinks that Mac's speed shop is good BBQ, you don't know BBQ!!  The food was amazing, Ive been looking for some good BBQ in Charlotte for a while now. Tried a whole bunch of different places and this is by far the best! The only reason it only gets 4 out of 5 stars is strictly because I have only been here once and I need to try some more of their food.   I ordered the \"Super Bird\" let me just say one word, AMAZING!! It was so so good, I also had some brisket which again was AMAZING, fall off the bone just like it should be! You can never go wrong with fried pickles and they do it right. It is not pickles chips like most places have but actual pickle slices. What this does is make it have more pickle flavor without all of the breading which is very good.The waitstaff is friendly and very inviting. That in itself is hard to find. We had the waiter Zach and he was great. Made a bunch of good recommendations on the menu and even other restaurants in the area.   A whole lotta people try BBQ and not many people can succeed and let me tell you, they go it right!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving some southern bbq/ brisket type food, so we picked this place. We had small sizes of \"briskets\" and \"burnt ends\". They were awesome! The briskets were really tender, almost melting away in my mouth. The burnt ends are really burnt ends of the briskets - chunks of meet that are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Both items came with nice hush puppies. We had bacon-wrapped jalapenos and crinkle-cut fries for sides. The jalapenos were really good. But we didn't like the fries. They were overcooked. Their spicy habanero sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte, I've eaten here on a regular basis. I always leave happy. If you have time to eat at one and only one restaurant in Charlotte, this is it."}
{"text":"Really delicious BBQ.  I would highly recommend the burnt ends and the mac and cheese.  I also got the fries as a side but would not recommend those.  Try some of their other sides instead.  Still a solid BBQ place and I would happily go back again!"}
{"text":"Bought a large banana pudding for 5.50 and the container was half full, aside from the fact that their banana pudding is basically just cool whip with 3 nilla wafers on top, barely any bananas in there. Very unremarkable desert experience, but their food is good. If you've got a sweet tooth, go to Lupie's on Monroe road for your banana pudding fix."}
{"text":"Midwood was close to my hotel and I wanted to see what Carolina Barbeque is all about. Let's just say that I took a few bites of the ribs and decided it best that I just leave them alone and chuck it up to a loss...I'll stick with the \"q\" in L.A.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Smack yo momma in the mouth, come back for more then punch yo daddy in the mouth, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great staff, our waitress, Harmonie, made some excellent recommendations. The brisket was good and you must try the whipped banana pudding."}
{"text":"Super food and even better service! Cortes was our main server but it truly a team effort! The grilled cheese with brisket or smoked veggies --- yumlish."}
{"text":"I went in for Lunch on Sunday with my daughter and both of us were happy. She praised the service and enjoyed the food and I too felt the same."}
{"text":"Pork plate is always on point. The mac and cheese is waaaaay better than Mac's Speed Shop, probably my favorite in CLT. Smoked veggies are a treat, but I wish the portion were a little bigger. You have to ask for a sauce sampler plate if you want to try anything other than the basic vinegar sauce (which I find a little weak for my taste), but the hot, mustard and sweet are all solid."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good.  Best que I've ever had & especially the brisket.  I think they make their own sauces on site--just an assumption.  Even the side items were awesome."}
{"text":"So I went here today for my Anniversary and 1st let me state the waitress Molly C was rude. The tried to sit us a little table but my husband is 6\"5 and the chairs are to small. We requested a booth and the hosted said they keep the booths open for guest with a party of 8. But when we look over at the booths,  there is guest of 2 sitting in several of the booths. The hostess walks up back up front and tell us we would have to wait until someone get up from the booths closest to the door to be seated, but than changed her mind and seat us in the same booths she told us we could not sit in. After we was seated, I notice the waiter Molly walk over and asked why she put us there and the hostess said I just sat them there, I'm sorry,  \"I am still looking for you a big party.\" So this immediately mad me mad and I knew it was all about the tip. The waitress Molly came and was at 1st rude, it was written all over her face. Later she tried to relax, but kept running to the hostess station, to complain and the hostess kept assuring her that she is sure I big party was going to come in. Molly kept coming to our table to check if we were anything, hoping we were done for she want miss out on a big party if they came in. I asked for a to go box and left her an $11 tip, when our food was only $24, to make her aware that you have to watch how you treat people,  your actions and what you say could have affected your tip and the restaurants business. But I will never go back here again the baked beans was spicy hot, who in they mind serve hot baked beans, I suffer from a medical condition and cannot have spicy food. The cream corn was the only thing edible. The mac and cheese had a cheap taste, and why bring out a handful of onions with hush puppies?  Who in their right mind just going to eat raw sliced onions? The smoked chicken was dry and you could not pull it apart. I was expected garlic bread, but got sour dough toasted bread. Word for the owners please reconsider your ingredients for dishes, you don't know who could have a health condition or could be allergic to something and the waitress is not warning the food is spicy or have onions in it. They can never get my business again, besides feeling discriminated against the food was nasty."}
{"text":"This place has excellent bbq. Everything I've had there is delicious and good. It tends to get crowded at times so be prepared to wait a bit"}
{"text":"I am such a happy camper! Great food and even better service. The icing on the cake is the fact the mac & cheese is some of the best I've ever tasted. Compliments to the bartender as well. I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Second time here and tried the app smoked wings and pimento fries with brisket really good! Service is always great, staff is friendly. Will def be back next time in area"}
{"text":"After posting my review, Cory L. got in touch with me and wanted more information about my visit. She was very responsive and even asked my thoughts on things. This proves to me that I had a rare occurrence when I was there, as I thought may have been the case. Big thumbs up to customer service and Cory! Thank you for taking the time to respond. I look forward to my next visit there, I have been wanting more of that brisket and the bacon wrapped jalapenos!"}
{"text":"The food was so great! Get the mac and cheese with BBQ on it! Great servers and staff as well! The night we went was really busy but service was timely!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Bad service.  Dirty glasses, long wait for service with lacking follow-through.  When I told them that my ribs were cold they didn't offer to warm them, instead  they said that the air conditioner vent above me was the reason for the cold ribs!  Cocktail refills were hard to get.  They used standard lip service to talk away the conerns rather than taking action to cure.  The manager took our glass for a wine refill and literally 10 minutes later returned with a refill.  He offered it for free because he reolised the failure in proper service.  The food tasted great.  Their service left a bad taste.  We took the ribs to go.  Went elsewhere for dessert and drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here during the week around 8:00 or so and it was still pretty busy, so that speaks for itself with how much folks like the place.  Atmosphere was nice and it was cool to see that former President Obama once even ate here as can be seen by a couple of pictures near the front door.  I thought that was pretty cool too. It was a laid back place and casual attire is acceptable.   As for the food, it was recommended by the waitress to get the brisket since she said it was her favorite things there.  Worked out well because that's actually what I came for and let me tell you, it was some great brisket; some of the best I think I have ever had. It had a perfect smoky taste to it and I enjoyed it without even using any sauce on it since it tasted so amazing on its own. We will definitely be returning and I highly recommend coming here if you are in the Plaza Midwood area and want some great BBQ."}
{"text":"One of the best rack of ribs in my life. High quality pulled pork, sides, and service.   If you are visiting Charlotte and staying downtown, a visit is worth an über or a short cab ride"}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte on a business trip and sought out a good BBQ joint. This was the unanimous recommendation. The menu lists a good variety of smoked meat items. I ordered the burnt ends with a side of bacon wrapped jalapeños and an Oktoberfest from Olde Mecklenburg Brewery (they have a good rotating selection of craft beers, too). My wife ordered the sloppy joe sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both entrees were delicious and brought out hot. The beer was cold. We would definitely come back if we were in town again."}
{"text":"Great barbeque - pulled pork is good. Service was fab even though it was busy and our table was ready quicker than we had been told we would have to wait."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE WAS GREAT, THE FOOD WAS EVEN BETTER, BUT THEY'RE A BUNCH OF SCAM ARTISTS  We're visiting Charlotte for a concert and we wanted to go to get some BBQ. This place had a good rating so we went. Our server was really nice friendly and helpful. And he gave us the hard sell on their \"lunch special\" which was smoked short rib. The food came out and it was big and tasty. We both loved the food however we were both struck with awe as we saw our bill. The lunch \"special\" was 29 FUCKING dollars. When we saw that this place was not to expensive and saw the menu. We thought the lunch special would be similar to the affordable prices of the rest of the menu.   What we were given was a bait and switch that ended up fucking us over in the end. I'll go back here but I'm definitely not going to fall for this scumbag move by our waiter again."}
{"text":"Nothing like a little jaywalking and a mad dash across Central ave to stoke the appetite. While the parking is limited the food is great. The pulled pork platter is what I hope for when looking for BBQ. A mound of pork, creamy mac and cheese, hush puppies, along with sweet potato fries, and I'm in heaven. I'm hard pressed to think of a better BBQ place in Charlotte and look forward to trying their new location in Matthews."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good:  The bacon wrapped jalapenos were very delicious.  I think that they are cooked in a bit of brown sugar and some spices so they have a great sweet and spicy flavor.  Now the bad:  The BBQ, which is the most important part of  a BBQ place, was very mediocre.  I got the sampler plate with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork and I would describe all 3 as dry and a bit tough.  Basically, this is Chili's or Wendy's or some other fast-food-type place level BBQ trying to masquerade as real BBQ.  Even a mediocre hole in the wall type place will have better BBQ than this place.  I don't go to Charlotte that frequently and I was upset that I trusted the reviews on yelp and went to this place.  I wasted an opportunity to try a better BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse FTW!!   My fiancé and I went out to dinner with a couple friends and when plans fell through at another establishment because of a storm (closed kitchen), Midwood Smokehouse pulled through! First off, I would like to compliment our waiter Cameron for his excellent customer service! He was very personable and provided us with great recommendations for both food and drinks. I got the pulled pork platter with macaroni and cheese and cole slaw and it was amazing! The burnt ends would be another fantastic choice (a little bit fatty, but good!) It was kind of loud when we were there, I think they turned the music up loud to offset the alarm that was going off because of the storm, but that was out of their control! I've dined at this particular location several times along with the Ballantyne location, but this will be my go to for BBQ! Awesome experience overall! Ask for Cam!!"}
{"text":"Visited last Monday evening with a large group. Ordered the St. Louis ribs. Was informed 15 minutes after my order was taken that they had run out of ribs. Tried ordering the burnt tips only to be told they had ran out of them as well. Never would have happened in Texas!"}
{"text":"This adventure of Excited about Eating takes us to the Midwood area of Charlotte to Midwood Smokehouse. This restaurant is tucked into the edge of a building, but it's bigger than it looks.  A Friday lunch was a 10 minute wait, but it probably took that long to snag a parking spot. Although the restaurant was jammed, service was attentive and prompt.  For starters we ordered the Fried Pickles, unique, in that they were sliced length-wise. They were coated in a spicy batter, crispy like I prefer, but I would've enjoyed them more with half the salt.  Since we expected to eat a hefty dinner that night, we shared the BBQ combo which included four meats: pork ribs, sausage, brisket (lean, fatty, combo), and chopped pork. We chose mac and cheese and creamed corn for the two sides.  The combo plate came with three dipping sauces: Midwood Signature (sweet, with just a hint of tang) for the ribs and brisket, Eastern NC Vinegar for the chopped pork, and South Carolina (spicy) Mustard for the sausage. The ribs had a wonderful smoky flavor and fall-off-the-bone meaty goodness, the star of the meats. Dora here, the ribs were finger-licking great, but Ernie's home-smoked ribs are still better. :)  The sausage ranked second, mild with just the right amount of kick. I especially liked the dark bark in both the chopped pork and brisket. Ditto for Dora. And the corn had a firm consistency, not soft or mushy. The spiral pasta had a deep cheesy flavor, but it could've been a tad warmer for my liking.  I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq in a really cute neighborhood!  The wait staff was really friendly and helpful.  Brisket and pork had tons of flavor and the portions were just right.  I was here on a business trip and so glad I made a stop at Midwood!  We went early because we had the kids with us and it was family friendly. Love the art work, really fun atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Pimento cheese were awesome! Hush puppies were really delicious too with ketchup. I had the BBQ pork sandwich - it was very tasty but a little difficult to eat as the bread fell apart pretty quickly. My friends enjoyed the ribs, said the chicken was a tad dry. Overall great BBQ and good service."}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounded up for good service and a great atmosphere and THE AMAZING PECAN COBBLER.  I've heard much about Carolina BBQ and it's goodness, so I decided to pick what seemed like one of the best BBQ joints in Charlotte.  I'm not a BBQ snob by any means, but I've had my fair share of the stuff and am a Southern Belle originally, if you may - I know good BBQ when I taste it.  Service here was great - our waiter was helpful, extremely patient with us waiting for our 3rd person, and very friendly.  Great show of true Southern hospitality.  We opted out of ordering appetizers, since the one we were going to order (bacon wrapped jalapenos) was a choice for a side dish.  The 3 of us \"pigged out\" with the pig out combo platter and doubled (actually, paid extra and tripled) on the ribs and got double brisket.  The ribs were delicious and I loved it with the habanero BBQ - love the heat, which isn't too much.  The brisket, however, was lacking for me.  It wasn't the best brisket I've had and it wasn't as juicy as I've had other places.  They have choices of lean, fatty, or both.  As for the sides, the mac and cheese was heavenly.  Not way too cheesy and just the right amount.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos reminded me of jalapeno poppers, but not frozen, and seems like they are made fresh.  A little too much bacon for me though (I know right, too much bacon said nobody ever).  The cole slaw (regular flavor) was refreshing.  Bottom line - get the mac and cheese!  Now the dessert was THE STAR OF THE SHOW.  The pecan cobbler, which is basically like a MASSIVE piece of pecan pie without the crust nobody likes to eat, is probably one of the pecan-pie-anythings I've ever had.  You MUST get the vanilla ice cream on top for an over-the-top overly-sweet indulgent dessert and you must NOT think about the calories.  My friend and I shared it and didn't think we would finish it, but after the first bite there was no stopping us.  I love love love loved the filling of the pie - perfect consistency.  I will definitely come back just for this.  Great choice for BBQ in an area close to Uptown."}
{"text":"Lots of good food, but avoid the beef brisket. I LOVE their pulled chicken, spicy sauce, mac & cheese, and collard greens. A \"5\" for those. But twice now, I have ordered food for a party, and both times the beef brisket was so fatty that guests barely ate it. NOT what you want to have happen when feeding 25 people. NOT worth $18/ pound, when it's 50% fat. The 1st time, I assumed it was a one time bad batch. But this 2nd time causes me to think that the restaurant willingly buys and serves very fatty beef brisket, at least for bulk/catering orders. Not cool."}
{"text":"Just HEAVEN!  I really wanted try the whole menu!  But this time I had the pulled pork and WOW was it good!  I can't wait to go back to try the brisket!"}
{"text":"Delicious. My bff and I used to eat here as often as we could. Nomzz."}
{"text":"Our group from work had lunch at Midwood today. The place was packed but our group of 6 were seated fairly quickly for a Friday.  I ordered the Small Carolina BBQ plate and side of sweet potato fries. The BBQ was delicious, moist and flavorful. Fries fantastic.  Our server Amanda was amazing. Even though the restaurant was packed she kept refills coming, table clean and packaged up to-go items with fresh containers of sauce. All done with a smile.  Wish I had saved room for dessert - maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I visited this comfortable restaurant today for lunch, and I'll definitely be coming back. A few of us split the queso, and the other side had the queso with brisket (which is a tad more delicious). I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, with the slaw on the side and a side of BBQ Baked Beans. Instead of getting the SC Mustard sauce that comes on the sandwich, I asked for a sweet sauce and they provided me with the Midwood House BBQ sauce. That was suuuch a great decision! The sandwich was wonderful; the pulled chicken was tender, and there was so much meat that I was able to take some home. The baked beans, which our server Kecia recommended, were delicious!! They had meat in them (for all the plant-based eaters) and they were sweet and soft. The cole slaw was also pretty delicious. I was at a table with 5 other ladies, and all of us got bags to go home. The sweet tea was just a tad bit strong, but good indeed. I'll be back soon to try the brisket.  Had to make a quick edit; I think the chicken messed with my stomach. It started hurting about 20 minutes after eating, and was sensitive for a good 2 days. I'd recommend the brisket and be careful with the chicken."}
{"text":"Decided to come by here after visiting the record shop nearby as I saw a lot of people dining here. Parking was an absolute hot mess but somehow found a spot in an alley. The place was really loud, had sort of a bar atmosphere. Could see this being a great place to catch a game. They had a happy hour special on shiner bock which was awesome. Service wasn't that slow considering how busy they were. I ended up getting the brisket and when it finally arrived I wasn't too impressed. It was a little overcooked for my taste. Such a disappointment. My date had the cheese fries and they were pretty good. Overall not a bad experience but not a place I foresee myself visiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We eat here more often than I'd like to admit.  Hits: PIMENTO CHEESE FRIES (Add pulled pork), Chopped Salad (Add pulled pork), Barnyard Burger (Burger + Bacon + BBQ + BBQ Sauce + Fried Onion rings = Perfection), Hush puppies, ALL OF THEIR SAUCES, homemade salad dressings, and any/all meat they offer  Misses: Mac N cheese wasn't impressive but that's about all I can think of...  This place knows meat. Best BBQ joint in Charlotte for SURE but that's not saying much really...it's some of the best (moist) BBQ and pimento cheese i've had anywhere!  Do yourself a favor & try this place! The service is always great too! Nothing but positive things to say :)"}
{"text":"Dining at Midwood is always a pleasure. I had the Brisket Rueben and it was killer. Pair it with some bacon wrapped jalapeños and you can't go wrong. Definitely will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Get the Mac and cheese!!! So freakin good! Also had the pulled chicken, which was flavorful and hush puppies that came with my dinner were good also. Hubby had the ribs, which were pretty good, but not as good as the ribs we had at the Plaza Midwood location. We were being fat that day so we shared the pecan cobbler which was amazing!! Our server was also very attentive and friendly. We scarfed our food so quickly I wasn't able to take yelp pics!!"}
{"text":"Make this a must stop on the way or while in Charlotte! So so so damn good! From the apps to the combo platter to the out of this world deserts! Stop here do not pass Go! Go directly to Midwood!!!"}
{"text":"The wait time was a terrible start. We waited about 30 minutes to get seated. The moment we were assisted we were given time to look over and place our order. I had the bbq chicken, I wasn't really impressed with it. I've definitely tasted better. Our server never refilled our drinks since we arrived. Not really worth the price I paid for my meal."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. The gf and I sat at the bar in our usual fashion and ordered a few drinks before eating. The bartender (sorry, can't remember the name) was very friendly and gave us some recommendations for parts of the city to check out while we here.   BBQ was solid as were the hush puppies. None of that smother your meat in sugary BBQ sauce nonsense; all tender, juicy meat, and you add your sauce. You could not go wrong coming here, good atmosphere, good food, good company. Overall a memorable experience but wouldn't quite hit my top favorite BBQ places."}
{"text":"i had pulled pork, it was pretty good but the burnt ends were the best! i also really loved the baked beans with bits of pulled pork in them. i'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Shared the combo plate with Mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapeños.  Brisket,  ribs, sausage, and pulled pork were all great.  Sauces excellent especially the spicy and eastern nc vinegar based.  Atmosphere is nice and service fine."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a smokehouse before. Now I know what I have been missing.   Kaz was an excellent server.  Very friendly and fast. Love the music and the decor.   Will come back again soon.  Had the ribs. The burnt end brisket.  Excellent.   They also have tv s to watch sports and a nice bar."}
{"text":"Loved it. From the appetizers to the dessert, we had an excellent experience. Barbecue plates, salads, and sandwiches all got great reviews. The pecan pie cobbler with ice cream was a revelation. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"This place has great barbecue. Meat is smoked to perfection with a variety of sauces to choose from. The wings are one of my favorite things to get. This place has a great atmosphere with friendly service to go along"}
{"text":"I visited Midwood with my teammates to select a bbq place to cater our company picnic.  We were able to sample a lot of things from the menu.  All was very very good.  The service was great in the restaurant and we were did not hesitate to agree that we wanted Midwood to cater for us. And 2 weeks later....we were at Freedom park and Midwood provided great food and service for our event.  The greatest thing that also prompted this 5 star rating is....the service we received from the person that delivered the food...and helped with setup and service.  Simply amazing.  Will get back to Midwood for another great lunch or dinner!!"}
{"text":"Go to for BBQ. I am from Charlotte and strangely not the biggest fan of BBQ but this is some of my favorite. Their brisket is the perfect balance of fatty and meaty and with great staples like mac and cheese and collards you will not leave hungry.   Also tried their kickin' mule (moscow mule with jalapeno) and it was great!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Carolina-style BBQ I've had since moving to NC, and the collard greens were fantastic! Parking is a little scarce and Midwood is pretty popular, so be prepared for a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. Service was fast and courteous, even with the crowd (thanks, Mallory!)  Dinner with appetizer and a soft drink came out to about $24, before tip."}
{"text":"I am a 60 year-old BBQ aficionado. When I travel the southern half of the U.S. (which is often), I am always in search of the best BBQ. I have had spectacular BBQ in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Kansas, and North Carolina... tiny mom & pop joints, chains, one-offs, the most famous, and unknowns. Midwood Smokehouse may be the best I've ever had, anywhere.   Though it's not my favorite, I do like good pulled pork. The pulled pork at Midwood is THE BEST I've ever eaten anywhere, hands-down. Doesn't even need sauce. Terrific smokey flavor, good char on the outside bits, just amazing.  The brisket is also maybe the best I've ever eaten. Tender, smokey... you can get it lean or juicy and more fatty... really incredible.  We tried their bacon-wrapped, deep-fried (!) rib appetizer and though a bit crispy and dry for my wife's taste (she's a Californian and I'm a southerner), I thought it was excellent.  Creamed corn was delicious... her grilled veggies were truly excellent. Servings were HUGE (\"Are you SURE that's the 'small plate'?\"  And big kudos to manager Natalie who went out of her way to welcome us, and even personally make some sandwiches (off menu) we could take on the plane for our flight back to CA. Every restaurant in America would do well to try to find someone like her!  Will definitely eat there any time we're in Charlotte. Have also eaten at the Ballantyne location... same excellent food.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Terrific lunch today with server Kim, backed up by a team that all works together to make sure you're really taken care of. Sizable portions and everything is tasty. Brisket and Carolina BBQ are tops and all sides tasty. Bonus - hushpuppies! and plentiful servings off beverages. Cool hostess/manager. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Midwood Smokehouse.  It's right down the road, they have good beer specials & I'm a big fan of bbq.  But the quality is just not there.    I liked the cuban sandwich, it wasn't amazing but it was certainly tasty & the mac & cheese is pretty decent,  but everything else there I've had has been seriously lacking.  I ordered a BBQ plate the second time we went there & the bbq was completely dry & their sauce did nothing to help it.  The third time I had a bbq sandwich & ended up with food poisoning.    A word of warning, the bacon jalapenos are no joke, they are absurdly spicy, too spicy for me even."}
{"text":"The BBQ ( and all of their other food) is so good here!  I got St. Louis Style Pork Ribs with Hushpuppies, Mac & Cheese & Baked Beans. The ribs were full of flavor, and so moist, that they practically fell off the bone. The sauce I got was the Midwood Signature and they've got it goin' on. The hushpuppies were so good. They were perfectly fried and were little bites of yumminess. The mac & cheese and baked beans were good as well. We also got some Banana Pudding for dessert and it was really good. It was fresh, creamy, and full of banana-y flavor.  The service was good. Our waitress was very helpful and checked on us pretty often, even though we were sitting outside.  This place gets packed as the night goes on, and parking is bad since the lot is small. So yeah, if you don't want to wait long, or deal with parking, make sure to come here earlier."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  Worth the wait. We tried the pulled pork, chicken, ribs and burnt ends. Sides were excellent too!! Can't wait to go back and try dessert as we ran out of room. :)"}
{"text":"Run of the Mill... Perhaps I have been spoiled by North Carolina BBQ.  This place does not meet the standards.  The sauce was ok, but the sauce did not make the BBQ good.  I was not excited about the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal for barbeque.  Very nice beer selection as well.  I also thought our server did a great job and was very helpful, even though the place is very busy so it's not easy of the staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Charlotte for the Elevation Church Live recording at Time Warner Arena and needed some late night grub after that event. This place hit.the.spot.! The service was fast and very friendly, atmosphere was what you'd expect at a non-chain BBQ spot. Parking was easy. And most importantly the food was amazing. Great Mac and cheese, beef brisket was out of this world and the pork burnt ends were packed full of great smokey flavor. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've come here a few times and it never disappoints. The service is awesome too, they're all attentive and personable without being overly attentive. Good portions for the price and it's seriously the best BBQ I've ever had. The hush puppies are amazing as well and the vinegar house sauce is sooooooo good. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Is really nice. The service is fast and consistent. We went there because the reviews in yelp. And really they are very close to te reality. Really is good place to have a great meal or drink."}
{"text":"We have been to Midwood Smokehouse many times, but never on a Saturday night during the heart of the dinner rush. Wow! They were slammed! With that being said, we waited the 20-25 minutes they told us we would. We were seated, with our waitress showing up shortly thereafter. She wasn't rattled or rushed and got our drink order out quickly; she took our food order, and our meal came out fast, considering the crowd. Like with any other time we've been to Midwood, we thoroughly enjoyed our food- my husband got barbeque and I got chicken tacos. More than enough food and always consistent in taste. We spent $25 on 2 meals, not including tip. People were waiting outside and several deep when we left at 7:15. Worth the wait! Apparently they now take reservations, which we will remember next time."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue, and a great place.  Had the pork, collards, baked beans, and hush puppies.  All of those were among the best I've had, and that comes from tasting great barbecue in Texas, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Memphis, and Kansas City.  Collards were exceptionally good, and pepper sauce added a little kick.  All by the recommendation of the server, Liz, who was as sweet as could be.  Atmosphere in the place was also notable, with all-American decor and classic and new rock hits playing over the speakers.  Overall, an outstanding place to spend a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First time come here and the food was good! I had the pulled chicken BBQ and they gave me a generous portion of chicken. The mac and cheese was good, nothing to write home about but good. Greens were surprisingly tasty. Overall the food was solid. Well earned 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this place. I asked my Airbnb host where I could find some real Carolina BBQ and she pointed me to Midwood. We ordered the brisket (both fatty and lean portions), bbq baked beans, cole slaw and pecan cobbler. The brisket was tasty but a tad bit tough, but the baked beans, cole slaw and pecan cobbler more than made up for anything lacking with the brisket. The place was slammed busy all night so I knew we were in the right place."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is great (see what I did there). The service, food, bourbon and company could not have been better. Had the smoked wings won't ever be able to eat any other wings again!!!"}
{"text":"This is on my list of Charlotte favorites.  Beef Brisket was awesome. Got the half and half (lean and fatty). While the fatty piece was truly fatty, it blended well with the lean to provide a very satisfying taste. Even though I love brisket and BBQ, the large 10oz serving was pretty hefty.  6oz serving of pork or brisket appeared to satisfy my entire party so keep in mind that the bigger platter comes with the extra side so that could also factor in your decision of 6oz versus 10oz or heck - possibly even share a 10oz platter with a friend.  Bacon wrapped jalapenos could easily make an appetizer menu at any bar or restaurant across the country. It truly was the hidden gem on my platter. It wasn't that spicy and bacon wrapped anything.... well, it's just plain cool and great!  Mac & cheese was enjoyable.  Staff was awesome with service & refills. She was quick to make recommendations and the manager came by to ask how we were doing and thanked us for stopping in.  Definitely felt the Southern hospitality at Midwood!"}
{"text":"Endless possibilities of delicious filling BBQ options. Come with an appetite and Tums. Parking can be a challenge during busy times. I also used Midwood Smokehouse for catering my rehearsal dinner as well as a neighborhood picnic, and they did not disappoint. Great service and good food in a hip hood. The bar isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Found this gem thanks to Yelp it was amazing BBQ, all my colleagues were pleased.... Had a Bee Sting drink with sweet tea and it was amazing. The Collard Greens were some of the best I ever had. Must visit if your in the area looking for BBQ."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Needed to come here for good southern BBQ since I was in the area and I was very pleased.  Started with the smoked wings with sauce on the side (best thing they had here). Wings we're so flavorful and delicious it was unreal! For my plate I had the pig out portion of the meat combo and got mixed brisket with burnt ends and double ribs. They were all very good but not the best BBQ I've ever had and the portion seemed kinda small even though I ordered the larger one.  Brisket and burnt ends stole the show for the entrees.  My mom got the burger with brisket and it was fantastic, definitely recommend looking for a massive and delicious burger.  Desert was great, I didn't know pecan Cobbler was a thing but O man was it delicious! Apple pie was on special for the day and it melted my heart it was so good! Best BBQ I've had in the Carolina's and the service was very friendly.  Unfortunately they have a tiny bathroom and unneeded to go the entire time but it was in use from the moment I walked in to when we left so that kinda dampened the experience but I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a great BBQ experience."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and all I can say is, WOW! Delicious food and tasty handcrafted cocktails. I highly recommend Nicki as server, she is funny and caring while providing exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Midwood is delicious and very casual as bbq should be. The food is always hot and plentiful with plenty of options and variations both flavor and selections alike.  Great kid friendly options with a good price. All in all its my favorite neighborhood bbq joint!"}
{"text":"Wow I wasn't expecting the brisket to be that great as I just moved from texas but I was horrified when the pork was even worse. I always bragged NC knows pork BBQ and Texas honestly is not that good at it. Sigh. I will never understand yelp reviewers. This is objectively not good bbq."}
{"text":"Great food! Their brisket is some of the best in town. And they've got great sides and specials. Good beer selection too! No, seriously...get the brisket. Lean, fatty, or mixed. I prefer mixed. I've always had awesome service too."}
{"text":"So, I rave on and on about good BBQ because it's probably one of my favorite things to eat. And I can rave on and on about Midwood! The problem is, that it's so affordable, we can get too many sides and then end up being full before our wonderful, juicy, fall-off-the-bone MAN-MEAT portions arrive. (Make sure you try the fatty brisket! Uh-oh! Mouth's a-waterin'!) And then we have to be abolutely miserable to try and stuff down dessert. I mean, we do try...  This place is excellent. Service is a tad bit on the wonky side sometimes, and parking can be an adventure (as if the lot's full, you'll have to park across the street and play Frogger with the crazy Plaza-Midwood drivers), but I implore you...nay, I dare you to find better BBQ in Charlotte! (And if you do, please tell me all about it!)"}
{"text":"La atención excelente, probamos el full rack divino. Los hush pupies, los jalapeños con bacon , la crema de maíz . Los burnt ende de verdad que recomiendo este sitio."}
{"text":"Solid spot for authentic bbq. One combo platter is enough to share for most couples unless you ordinarily eat a lot.  The chopped pork is okay. The sauces weren't mind blowing but relatively standard.  The ribs were good but also nothing mind blowing.  Service was nice and price was reasonable. Food comes out fast.  Not near the best bbq I've ever had but thought it was a good showing."}
{"text":"Everything was really delicious!  Parking was a nightmare, but that's typical for Charlotte and Midwood.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Tasty mixed (fatty and lean) brisket with tangy sauce and PROPER IPAs on tap is all this humble Seattleite could hope for this far from home."}
{"text":"Love the Midwood Chopped salad! Tasty and it works for vegans who have meat-loving friends."}
{"text":"This place is quite good and worth traveling outside of uptwon Charlotte to locate (much better than the BBQ I tried in uptown).  They have a good menu selection of pulled pork, chicken and beef brisket, and a healthy choice of sides to choose from.  The problem I had was what to try, but my salvation was the taco plate.  Yeah, that seems like a strange offering in a BBQ place, but you could mix and match 2 or 3 tacos to try all meats (pork, chicken and brisket), and it comes with a choice of side too.  HINT:  The creamed corn, and bacon wrapped jalapenos are delicious.  The coleslaw comes on some of the tacos, so you got to try that too, and it was good.  We got fried pickles as an appetizer and a couple of local Carolina craft brews on draft made for an enjoyable meal.  Too full to try the cobbler for dessert, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state, a state that is known for it's barbecue, and this place is delicious! We had the decadent pimento cheese fries with brisket, delish! I had the midwood chopped salad with brisket, a salad with lots of good stuff in it-highly recommend. My sons got wings as an appetizer that they raved about, St. Louis ribs they loved, and a grilled cheese with pulled pork sandwich which was amazing. Staff was nice, bar staff was great too.  Would come again if I'm ever back here in the area."}
{"text":"Dude, this place is awesome!!!!! I got the beef brisket which is insane. But even better I was able to get a side of the Fat Tire BBQ SAUCE!!!  The sauce comes with one of their specials, but the bartender guy let me order it with my brisket on the side.   The bacon wrapped jalapeños are crazy good-I ordered the collared greens and was so satisfied.   They are super flexible with the menu and let you mix and match. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The flavors were not all there. The burnt ends were not as crusty and delicious as they should be. Brisket was ok, but nothing too special.  I miss Smoke Modern BBQ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had! Got the beef brisket and it was perfectly fatty and tender. My sister got the burnt pork tips and they were good too, not as good as the brisket though! The cocktails were super yummy, I had something that tastes like lemonade and my friend had something that tastes like sweet tea (forget the names, sorry!) but both were tasty and didn't taste like alcohol. Would defs recommend coming here if you're visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about mid wood and have been a couple times recently. Each time I have gotten the pulled pork sandwich, and while good, it didn't live up to the hype. I found the fries to be really salty both times.   This is definitely a great place for bbq! I wouldn't be opposed to returning. I might be getting the wrong thing, it just wasn't the best I've had in town. But everyone was else I was with loved it! So if you like bbq definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"A ton of food for a super reasonable price! I had the BBQ pork with bacon wrapped jalapenos and sweet potato fries. It also came with coleslaw and hush puppies. The large plate filled my belly and left me enough meat to take home for another meal. I liked that they offered a couple different BBQ sauces in squeezable bottles so you could have as little or, (in my case) as much sauce as you wanted.  While I didn't have a drink that night, the beer/cocktail/liquor list looked extensive.  They work with the 'No Wait' app and it's busy every night of the week, so I'd take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and perfectly cooked. Love the mac n cheese and brisket. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Midwood about once a week for 2 years. I never grow tired of their chopped salad, fresh Romaine lettuce tossed with black beans, corn, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots and cheese. I LOVE this salad. The smoked wings are large and tender and oh so good. The ribs are fall off the bone delicious. Service is always friendly and prompt. Cannot say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Yes I love bacon, yes I love pork, and yes I love this place!  I ate until my stomach, mouth and soul could eat no more.  The ribs don't even need sauce they are perfectly smoked and seasoned. The meat clings, just barely to the bone, and waits for just a hint of your teeth to come cascading into your mouth.  It's heaven from a firey pit.    Parking is a bit dicey at times, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place since I heard good things but unfortunately I wasn't too impressed. The waiter was kind of rude, as if he seemed annoyed to be there. I ordered the brisket sandwich as did my friend. I ordered mine with pimento cheese and my friend ordered cheddar, however we both received blue cheese. I really do not like blue cheese and this blue cheese completely over powered the sandwich. I would of complained but our server wasn't even the one to bring us our food and we didn't even see him again til the check came.   I don't know if I'll be returning to give it another try."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever, not counting Goode Company in Texas of course. Ribs are good but not that Goode. But I'm in Charlotte, so, I'll stop being so fussy. And Midwood has Banana pudding to die for. Go early, it gets very crowded. Sit at the bar for quicker service."}
{"text":"We LOVE Midwood Smokehouse and have been to 3 locations.  We have visited this location a couple times.  I stand by my 5 star reviews with the main location and this one had the potential to be 5 stars as well, as the food has been top notch each time.  This location just has issues with service.  One time we we missing a side with a large to go order but we didn't realize until we got home.  Didn't do anything about it as it was just a side. Just worth mentioning now since there are issues with this location.  Last Friday we came here to send my brother in law off with his last bbq before he went overseas for awhile.  Midwood was busy and had a wait, no issue, but when we were called in we were a table of 3 put in a booth meant for 6-8 people it looks like.  Made it incredibly hard to have a decent conversation with how wide we were spread out!  We ordered drinks from the bar.  Wrong drink came for me but it was fixed.  This was because the server wasn't paying attention, I even said my drink twice because I don't think he got it, clearly he didn't.   Food came and was prompt.  Was great as always.  Loved the pork and burnt ends!  Always consistent.   But after we got the food, it just seemed like they were trying to get us out as quickly as possible.  Asking if we were done.  Nope not yet.  My husband and I were finally done and had ours boxed up.  Server came back with the box and asked the two of us if we wanted anything else.  No.  Then he tries to take my BIL's plate when he was still eating.  Then he comes back with the bill.  Okay BIL is still eating and just got a new beer.  What is he wants something else?  He eventually finishes his plate and then he starts on his beer.  Waiter tries to take the bill but there is nothing in it, plus my BIL and husband are still working on beers.  One of the hostesses comes by and takes our water cups.  Okay, I guess we are done here then.  We just decide to pay and go on our way since they probably needed that large table for a different group.  Either way, we are still customers and should not be pushed.  Fix your service and you could be 5 stars too!"}
{"text":"The previous review took the words out of my mouth. I've been in Charlotte for a long time and love BBQ. There are a number of great BBQ restaurants here. What I love about Midtown Smokehouse was not only the food, It is incredible, but the service in the midst of packed place was PERFECT. I love it when I the appetizers vs. the entrees are timed perfectly. Meaning, when apps are requested they don't come out at the same time as the entree's. I know that may sound trite, but it really does show attention to detail. My complements to the Chef, Staff and Management.   For those who are visiting, you may wait for a table, but it's well worth it.   Mac's Speedway and Queen City BBQ, I love you very much. Ya'll are awesome. But you have some competition. :-)  Mean that with respect."}
{"text":"Have eaten at both the plaza midwood and Ballantyne locations. Have had great service when dining in and taking out. Nice beer list. Have enjoyed their brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. Love the different sauce options and their mac and cheese was pretty good. Definitely recommend for someone looking for a good BBQ dinner"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is a real smokehouse. With smoke.  The place isn't huge, I'd say it seats around 50 with the bar. But that's just perfect for me when it comes to BBQ. I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and by 12:15, there were just six seats at the bar left open. I started off with a regional craft beer, MW serves a good amount of regional stuff along with 1.50 PBR drafts on Saturday. Be sure to look at the board behind the bar for drink and food specials and if anything is 86'd.  I went with the brisket sandwich special w/ bleu cheese and red onions. I got a side of mac n cheese with it for 8 bucks. The sandwich comes on texas toast and is loaded up rather nicely. While I've had better brisket in Kansas City, I'm tipping my hat to Midwood on what looks to be a winning combination for a long time to come.   I'll be back to visit the food and friendly bar staff again!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm a snob, or spoiled, I'm not sure. Probably both. I don't understand what the fuss is about. First the BBQ pork my son has was good..not great, but good. I thought that mac and cheese was pasty and lacked flavor. It was warm, nit hot but tasted like glue. The hush puppy's were good, though. Now, the brisket... I'm not from Texas and love me some pork BBQ  (Lexington is the gold standard) but this brisket was weak... The \"fall off the bone\" tender actually was mushy. It tasted like it was boiled or steamed before it hit the smoker. It had NO smoke ring and the smoke flavor seemed to be artificial. I ordered mixed fatty and lean, as I know fatty is the way to go. It was actually greasy, not the luscious melted fat of a well smoked brisket. The \"bark\" was soggy and was overly salty. Again I think it had liquid smoke or smoked salt. or something. No spice or depth of flavor. Again the meat was \"unnaturally\" tender. steamed or boiled or maybe a \"meat tenderizer\" was added. A bright pink smoke ring should show on a brisket this thick, but none was apparent.  Needless to say, I was disappointed, especially at $10 for a small plate (1 side).  I'll give them another shot, but anyone how gives this place 3 stars or better doesn't know what they are talking about when it comes to Q! If it hadn't been or first visit I don't know if I would have given it 2 stars.  Oh, yea, service was good to excellent, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Tried the new location for Midwood tonight. It was opening night and the food was awesome! Lives up to the original Midwood standard and all the staff were very attentive. Brisket is great, collards are perfect, and mac n cheese is ridiculous. Management also gave us a piece of the pecan cobbler on the house. I'd never tried it before but I'm so glad they laid it on the table. My wife and I destroyed it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"While I'm no BBQ aficionado...I loved this place.  Started with bacon wrapped jalapeno/cheese poppers what we smoked and delicious.  We sort of split tow plates: the Burnt Ends and the Pulled Pork.  With that had four sides: Fries (meh), coleslaw (just OK), baked beans (yum), and creamed corn (rich version).  I enjoyed the pork more than the ends - pork was moist, perfectly pulled and sauced (with more available on the side) and nicely smoked.  The burnt ends were hit and miss - some nice and moist, others pretty dry.  Nice beer list of local and non-local craft brews, great music and vibe with adequate service.  I'd definitely go back if ever back in town.  We were debating between this and Mac's Speed Shop (describe to us later by locals as having a \"Hooter\" feel...they affirmed we went to the right spot!)"}
{"text":"The experience started out great with a queso with brisket. It was very good. The fried pickles were sliced very thin and they didn't have a lot of taste.  I would pass on them next time. I had the brisket sandwich. They added blue cheese and onions which over whelmed the brisket. I love brisket so it was disappointing to find that I had a blue cheese sandwich.  Overall I think they wanted to upscale the menu and lost sight of what makes a great brisket sandwich. Next time I'll try the sliced brisket to see how it tastes."}
{"text":"I'm ticked off at The owners of Midwood Smoke house.  After living in Plaza Midwood for over 10 years, you finally decide to open the most incredible barbecue joint there is in Charlotte and I don't live there anymore.    Let just start off by saying BURNT ENDS, BURNT ENDS, BURNT ENDS.  I don't care what you order, you have to at least try a side of burnt ends.   After traveling to Texas and Oklahoma this is the closest fatty brisket, I have found that even compares.  I would say it's even better, because it is a whole lot closer.   I cannot give a fair evaluation of all the food because the only thing that I've had is the fatty brisket, burnt ends and the bacon wrapped jalapeños.  Twice in the last week and will be going back in a few days with my co workers that have not been there yet.    I think as long as they stay true to the food that they are creating, they will have a long legacy in Charlotte.     Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my lil family were visiting charlotte and this place was my favorite of alll the other bbq spots we tried !!!! The brisket and turkey and ribs were sooo yummmmmy the cranberry sauce for the turkey was a tasty also mac n cheese was ok and the jalapeño jus need to be cooked a lil more but by far the best"}
{"text":"An understated outpost of 'cue on Central Ave., Midwood lacks many of the typical sign posts I look for when in search of great barbecue (i.e. storefront art featuring chef's hat and apron clad pigs gleefully cooking bacon).  If you look closely enough, you'll notice that the pig on the sign is smiling.  Once inside however, you instantly know you're on to something.  The bustling dining room offers tightly packed tables with plenty of seating, but I opted for a seat at the bar which offers a little more elbow room.  The stout bar stools offer support should you imbibe too much brew, or be overcome by \"the itis.\"  I can only speak for the pulled pork, which is served up Eastern style, and the mac 'n cheese--both are delicious.  You'll need access to a roll of paper towels for this one. I've mentally booked a return trip intended to sample the beef brisket.  So deep in pork country?! I know, it sounds crazy, but it says a lot about how much these people know what they're doing with that namesake smoker."}
{"text":"We went here last night after seeing the reviews and not having success in finding a good local bbq restaurant - we have tried quite a few!  We arrived and it was packed.  We were told 30 minutes, but it ended up being 5 minutes to wait, we will take that! It doesn't look like there are many tables, I can see this place being very busy in the summer.  Because it is small, it gets loud easily.  When you walk in you immediately notice the smell - and start drooling! Good thing it was only a 5 minute wait.  Kevin and I had the platter, picked 4 meats: shredded chicken, pork, turkey, and ribs.  Sides were mac and cheese and stuffed jalapenos wrapped in bacon.  Turkey: just okay.  Would not go for this again though.  Shredded chicken: Good flavor, but did not stick out in my memory like the remaining meats.  Ribs: the meat fell off so easily and had an awesome smokey flavor! A++ ribs!  Pork: the smokey flavor and whatever seasoning they have on the pork is outstanding!!  I'm drooling just thinking about it again.  A+++++, the best pork ever!  They give you sauces to go with the pork.  They are just okay - they have mustard based, tomato based, and vinegar based sauces, the first two being my favorite.  I didn't really use them, not because they were okay, but because the pork was just so good, I didn't want to mess with the flavor!  Sides, both excellent.  Mac and cheese was a good homestyle kind and cheesy!  The jalapenos were something I've never had, so bad for you, but yet so good!  Service was outstanding.  We were greeted and welcomed by our server quickly.  He never let our drinks get low and was very helpful - said if we didn't like something he would find us something to like! Wanted us to have a great experience, and we did.  Love this place and will be back soon for more pork!"}
{"text":"I am far from an expert in BBQ, and so I present my opinion as a lover of BBQ sauce and lifelong carnivore. This is indeed the place to be, and the Midwood combo is one of the best ways for 2-3 people to taste a broad selection of Southern BBQ. Out of the 5 meats to choose from, I give my stamp of approval to the oh-so-juicy brisket and the tender and succulent ribs packed full of flavor. For sides, go for perhaps the BEST BAKED BEANS I've ever eaten!! (It's gotta be that molasses...) The mac and cheese was A-OK.  Tip: Ask for sauces! The BBQ sauces come with varying levels of spice and some meats come with their own sauces too."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for the weekend and a friend from NC recommended that we tried their barbecue with vinegar sauce. We found Midwood Smokehouse on Yelp and decided to give it a try. And I'm glad we did! I got the Carolina BBQ with a side of hush puppies and collard greens. It was well-seasoned, perfectly cooked, and the hush puppies reminded me of corn bread, which I love. The portions are super generous and I'm sad that we had a plane to catch and I couldn't take leftovers :("}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is the best BBQ I have ever had.  Where are these other bad reviews coming from----maybe jealousy....I've had BBQ all over NC, Memphis and Texas and this one beats them all.  The brisket is amazing and i often dream about the beans and Mac and cheese!  I recently ordered the pimento cheese fries with pulled pork and they are the perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service... the South Charlotte needed a good BBQ place!"}
{"text":"I went to this place by accident, and wow, so happy for that detour! We had cheesesteak sandwiches (subbed mine for chicken) and both were melt-in-the-mouth amazing! Ya gotta go"}
{"text":"It's no secret, Charlotte isn't know for the best BBQ in the South. Meanwhile, Midwood does a great job at raising the bar in the Queen City. It's the top BBQ joint in town, by a lot. Many will debate that. However, I'm sorry Mac's Speed Shop, while your portions are much larger than Midwood, the quality, sauces and flavor are a notch below Midwood. Midwood succeeds at providing more than just good BBQ. They dish out great service, in an upbeat atmosphere complete with TVs and a full bar. It's a great place to come for a work lunch, on a date, with friends or for a celebration. They have plenty of local beers on tap, too, which bodes well with good BBQ.  I travel for a living, eat out three times a day more than 300 days a year and have been to more than 300 BBQ restaurants in the country (it's probably more like 500) so I'm holding a high bar comparing Midwood to the country's best. It's very good. And, when we're in Charlotte it's where we take friends and family if the word \"BBQ\" is mentioned. Hands down, if you're from Charlotte and haven't eaten BBQ consistently elsewhere, you'll definitely be blown away here. Everything is done well. From the meats, to dessert and sides, there's nothing that disappoints. In fact, even the hush puppies impress, which is hard to do.   Nevertheless, to be a 5-star, it must be one of the best BBQ places in the US and while it's darn close, it's one notch away from reaching the amazing BBQ you'll get a the Pompous Pig in Anderson, Smokin Pig near Clemson, Melvin's in the Charleston area, Louella's in Asheville, etc. I believe it's slightly better than a known Southern chain such as Jim N Nicks and blows away places like Smokey Bones and Sticky Fingers. Don't even bring up Sonny's and Dickey's. Midwood owns those places. In short, you need to eat here. It'll become one of your favorite places in Charlotte.   Deciding what to order isn't a chore, as long as you choose a combo platter, where four meats wind up on your plate. I'm not a big rib guy, so we normally split the Well Fed (feeds 2) or the Pig Out (feeds 3) and opt for the brisket, Hickory Smoked Sausage, Carolina Chopped Pork and Chopped Chicken BBQ. Consider that you are splitting this with another or two others and it's a great deal. Don't be discouraged, the St Louis Style Pork Ribs are good. I took my friends on a BBQ tour through the Carolinas and they enjoyed these ribs almost as much as a few of the above mentioned places. Another thing to consider is they do daily specials, too, such as Pork Burnt Ends, yum.   The two sides can be a challenge to pick. All are good. But, we are partial to two: smoked veggies and bacon wrapped jalapenos. Damn, these are good! If you've been to the Smokin Pig, the sweet potato fries here aren't as good, but they are much better than any you'd order at a normal restaurant and the greens are top-notch.  Another thing I like about Midwood is the range of available sauces. Rather than solely vinegar, like many places in Carolina they offer an assortment, which keeps everyone happy. All their sauces, South Carolina Mustard, Eastern NC Vinegar, Midwood Signature & Spicy Habanero are tasty and done well.   As for dessert, we've only tried the banana pudding. If you can fit any in your stomach after the large portions you ate already, give it a try. While Alabama's Dreamland continues to serve the best banana pudding, theirs is memorable, too."}
{"text":"A bit of an anomaly that a neighborhood NC bbq joint is known for their Texas-style brisket. But this stuff is legit. Got the large platter with a mix of fatty and lean brisket. Sides were also amazing - beans and bacon-wrapped jalapeños. And apparently 20oz beers are pint prices on Wednesdays, too. The bbq gods smiled on me today and this place did not disappoint- great service as well. I'm just bummed that I probably had the best meal in town on my first night here."}
{"text":"Besides getting to visit with our son and his girlfriend, coming to Charlotte and finding new places is something my husband and I love to do.  My son and his girlfriend are savvy when it comes to finding which places we should tryout and see.   Midwood Smokehouse was definitely a winner.  It is located in behind Park Road Shopping Center in a very nice building with an outdoor dining area.   We chose to be seated on the patio.  Our server was welcoming and attentive.  They offer \"small plate\" that includes one side, hush puppies and pickled onions and \"large plate\" that gives 2 sides, as well as the hush puppies and pickled onions.   I chose the small plate split 1/2 chicken  Midwood style along with fries and hush puppies.  Husband can never pass up the chance to try ribs.  He said the ribs were very good and he would positively order them again.  The four of us enjoyed our food and the different beverages offered.  My first time here but hopefully not the last."}
{"text":"Decent cue but kinda pricey. The pimento cheese fries with pork is outstanding and the beer selection is good. I was disappointed that there are no bottles of sauce on the table. I guess you have to ask."}
{"text":"Smelled great walking up to the door. All the staff were super nice. Ordered pork  ribs dry. Found the rub average at best, sauces were excellent. Ribs were a bit too fatty and meat fell off the bone and portion size was very large. I mean the meat actually falls off the bones while trying to cut them apart, i prefer a little \"tussell\" , you know chew the meat right off the bone. I probably ordered the wrong thing based on everyone else's reviews."}
{"text":"If they had a 3.5 star this would be my review, I still think they're a lil' pricey/precious on their drinks, but MAN is the food good..even the salads are killer...and I thought MACS did the best beef brisket I'd ever had til I tried this brisket....seriously so tender you can cut w/some slight pressure with a fork....  oddly the meat i think is not great is their BBQ itself....it tastes like its been soaking in a bottle of Liquid Smoke, just WAY WAY too smokey/pungent...i know u want smokehouse flavor but this is overkill....but everything else is really really good"}
{"text":"Travelled all the way from DC and worth every minute of the road trip....fantastic ribs and service top notch....definitely more road trips to Midwood are on the cards"}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. My waiter tonight was very attentive and helped me select great items for dinner. I had the brisket plate and added the burnt ends .  Collard greens were fantastic too."}
{"text":"My husband and I don't eat Bar-b-q regularly.  We hold out until it is no longer possible. When we go for Bar-b-q it is only at Midwood Smokehouse. Great servers who know the food, the food is HOT as in temp., the prices are reasonable and everything we order is great.  Good job Midwood Smokehouse! keep up the great job."}
{"text":"I recently stopped at Midwood Smokehouse to grab lunch, right before my flight back to Chicago. I was looking forward to try some Carolina bbq and this place delivered far beyond my expectations! My friends and I split a couple of \"pig out\" platters with pulled pork, brisket, St Louis ribs, sausage, and burnt ends...everything was delicious. The sides were super tasty as well: hushpuppies, mac n' cheese, baked beans (yum!), creamed corn, and the best smoked veggies I've ever had. The hosts were friendly and accommodating and Taylor, our server, was knowledgeable, attentive, and provided awesome local beer and bourbon recommendations. Midwood Smokehouse has  become a must-visit everytime I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite BBQ place in Charlotte!  The brisket is the best I have ever had. Super juicy and just the right amount of fat! (Although you can ask for it lean if you don't like the fat.) My favorite side is the grilled vegetables but I think most people would go for the macaroni and cheese or bacon wrapped jalepenos. I also love the sloppy joe and grown up grilled cheese which have all the flavors of childhood with enough flavor for my adult tastebuds!  They always have great beer selections and unlike most every other restaurant in Charlotte they don't start blaring the music at seven at night.  Easily one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Incredible meal The smoked wings might just be the best I ever had and I love all kinds of wings. Also bacon wrapped jalapeños were incredible We had a party of 8 and everyone loved it. The brisket was excellent. Great tap beers as well. Definitely coming g back when I am passing thru again"}
{"text":"Great food hurt by less than stellar service.  It has been several months since our last visit to Midwood Smokehouse.  The food was as great as ever.  My lean brisket had a great smoke ring and the right amount of juice.  My bacon wrapped jalapeños were just amazing as I remember and a highlight for me.  The pickled onions were also very tasty.  My wife's salmon was cooked perfectly.  The kids' meals were very good as well.    The only downside was not particularly attentive service.  The best example was when she refilled my iced tea, she brought room temperature tea which melted all of the ice in my class.  This left me with a like warm overfilled glass...  Yes, overfilled in that she spilled it on the floor and table when refilling.  I am not a fan of hovering wait staff, but this was to the other extreme.  It was not particularly busy so maybe this was just a bad night.    In all, we are reminded of how much we love the food at Midwood and look forward to more visits soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!  We sat at the bar while we waited for our table. The bartenders were attentive and knowledgeable about the specifics of each beer.   Our server was also knowledgeable. He was able to tell us about favorites, provide information about the company and explain the different sauces and flavors of the meat.   We had tacos with roasted vegetables and the build your own salad.  The prices were unbelievably low. Our meal total was under $30."}
{"text":"Went here once with my family, and everything came out cold and when a restaurant brings out cold food, I am sorry I can't really forgive it. They did take it back and give us new warm food again not hot and it was terrible. Save your money."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very friendly hostess. Our waiter was great and gave us many recommendations since it was our first time there. I had the BBQ pork sandwich with the vinegar based slaw and a side of Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing!! I definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"After all the reviews I was excited to go...but unfortunately let down. Went with the entire family but every sauce was too spicy for the children to be able eat anything. Meat was good but not great...I've had better BBQ for half the price...maybe I went on a bad night."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a Saturday, it was busy but we were sat right away. Luckily had the lovely Ivy as my server for my first time here. She made excellent recommendations. She recommended the Pom Fire as a drink and it was absolutely amazing. I had the Hot Mess and it was also amazing. One of the best burgers I've ever had. I probably finished it in record time. Super cheesy southern style Mac n cheese as my side. I already can't wait to go back and try more. Ask for Ivy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.. got there late so they were out of some items but everything they did have was exceptional"}
{"text":"Took my crew to Midwood Smokehouse last night...1st time there. Food was great...had the St Louis Ribs, they were done to perfection with just right amount of smoke taste. When I first ordered them I was told they were out...I asked for the manager...my server came back and was able to fill out 2 rack order.  She handled the issue just right and was attentive through the whole meal.  My wife had the Brisket tacos and Loved them...shared a bit with me and It may be a real toss-up on what to order next time.  The side were good particularly the baked bean...has some spice to them and they were yummy.  Had a few Ice cold Triple-Cs which went perfect with the food.  Ambiance is nice and casual.  Job well done! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I know many that LOVE this restaurant - but I just don't get it. I've been twice for lunch and was way underwhelmed. I love good BBQ and have had plenty of it, this restaurant does not come anywhere near the great BBQ I have had. The pulled pork sandwich, a 6 out of 10 at best. Very dry, though they do have a nice selection of BBQ sauces that you can add. The mac and cheese, rather bland - though I did appreciate it not being dry as some mac and cheese can be. The hush puppies were hush puppies, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Love bbq and tacos at Midwood. I enjoyed the meal and the service here. The original location has more character but the food is equally delicious both places. The parking is definitely easier in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Meh...  I was very disappointed based on other reviews, and maybe I went in at bad time but the food was average at best.  Our server had a bad attitude, with all the other barbecue options in the area you can definitely do better."}
{"text":"Best damned banana pudding I've ever had (and I'm kind of a connesieur at this stuff!)   Fast, friendly, and personalized service too . . . What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Here's the big question.  Midwood or Sauceman's?  Oh that could prompt an endless debate.  So here's my take:  Midwood is the more pretentious, hipster-esque BBQ joint.  This is where I'd bring a friend who I'd like to impress with a cool BBQ spot and share a few local beers.  Whereas Sauceman's feels more casual and relaxed.  Almost like eating at a pit stop.  This is where I'd bring a friend who just likes eating BBQ.   Midwood is BBQ on a creative slant.  Burgers and tacos ... that's beyond the simplified offerings from the pit.  Bacon-wrapped jalapeño is delicious but ... that's just fixin's dolled up.  But don't get me wrong.  I can gnosh on these bacon jalapeño's all day.  Whereas Sauceman's is BBQ plain and simple.  The red slaw is a perfect digestive to the heaping amount of pulled pork you'd be served.  The hush puppies balances out the BBQ tray by offering you something mealy savor.    In a pure side-to-side comparison of solely the pulled pork (ignoring every other meat and side), I'd give the edge to Sauceman's.  Even when absolutely stuffed, I just couldn't put down the fork.  I just kept eating and eating.  Again, the red slaw helps tremendously.  But Midwood is legitimately good on its own right.  Briskets were above average.  Ribs about average.  Sides were above average.  Come on .... 508 reviews can't be wrong.  It's the most popular place in all of Charlotte.  Of course you'll come and you'll love it too.  If you took everything in consideration, Midwood and Sauceman's ends up being a tie in my book.  BBQ Hop 2015 #2 [March 2015]"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum!!!  LOVE the food and never had bad service. Downside is parking and they get super busy. I just try to hit it on down times to avoid the parking issues and the wait."}
{"text":"Was in the South Park area and looked on yelp of a BBQ place to eat at. Saw this place was new and decided to try it.  And it was delicious! Staff greets you right away when you walk in. We got the queso brisket small dish and it came out and we thought it was a large dish. It was a very good choice to get that cause it was very delicious. My girlfriend got the brisket small plate  and it came with hush puppies and pickled onions with a side door of mac and cheese and they ask if you want fat, lean, or both for the brisket. The mac and cheese was very cheesy. I got the 1/2 chicken and it also came with hush puppies and the pickled onions and I received two sides with my plate. I ordered the BBQ baked beans and jalapeño wrapped bacon and they were very delicious. I could've ate a whole plate of them. The waitress we had was very friendly and asked a couple of times how we were doing. If it's a nice day make sure to ask to sit outside. They do run the ac a little low so it does get cold inside.  The patio is a very big area. The BBQ sauce was okay for me. There ice is the best! It's the little chunks that last long. It was to sweet for me but my girlfriend loved it. They have 2 other locations. If your around for BBQ this a place to go!"}
{"text":"Midwood BBQ Bar was suggested to us as it is quickly becoming a BBQ institution in Charlotte. We had the pleasure of dining there at their Ballyntyne location on New Years Day for dinner.   North Carolina and Charlotte in general have a lot of BBQ restauarants. Most are very average. Some pulled chicken or pork smothered in copious amounts of some mysterious red sauce so you can't even tell if the meat was actually good ! That is NOT the case here at Midwood. For starters they only use hickory wood to smoke their meats in a one of a kind old school manual commercial smoker.  Someone has to feed the smoker constantly to keep the fire going and maintain a even temperature in the smoker at all times. That takes a lot of work . More art than science and it shows in their food.We started with some smoked wings. dry on the outside but moist and flavorful inside. My daughter chose the kids pulled pork sandwich w/sweet potato fries. She loved it ! They have a wonderful taco selection {yup, tacos at a BBQ spot !} You have a choice of 3 . All were fresh and yummy. The baked mac and cheese disappeared promptly also ! I had a new years special that is not normally on their menu. Pork shoulder , collards and black eyed peas. All for good luck to start 2017. Their extensive cocktail and bourbon/whisky list made a choice rather difficult. My hubby kept it classically simple with a Makers Mark 46 and Ginger Ale.   Service was prompt, informative and friendly. The manager demanded we try some brisket before we departed , so we managed to try a few bites. WOW ! tender, tasty and perfect mix of lean and fat.Midwood is now our \"GO TO \" spot when we are in Charlotte and craving REAL BBQ !"}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good bbq. Thursday nights is the night to check this one out since they let you bring in 40 ounce mugs and get top offs for anywhere from 4$ to 8$ depending on the beer.   The service here is excellent and as I said the food is good but it tends to get a bit cramped inside. If you are sitting at a high top or the bar you are always getting jostled around but bring on the 40 ounce beers and all those minor concerns will fade away."}
{"text":"Great bbq, great local beers on tap, and great service. Went there on a Friday night and it was busy, but the wait was not bad at all. Just enough time to drink a beer outside on the patio. Cool atmosphere and a good neighborhood with plenty of places to grab some drinks after you eat. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Love their bbq, whether pulled pork, chicken, or brisket they are outstanding at bbq meat! I also like the el fuego & chicken tacos when I am feeling not as hungry. The sweet potato fries are delicious. And I eat the roast veggies when I'm being healthy usually. They have a good take on the Moscow mule cocktail and their margaritas that have old bay on the glass with salt. Sort of a salty sweet smoky pairing for margaritas."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had!! I wish I lived in Charlotte because I would be eating here everyday!  The brisket, mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapeños were off the chains delish!  My husband had the chicken and ribs plate so of course I tried the ribs....sooooo damn good! Plus they give different bbq sauce options and my fav was the one with the hint of jalapeño or habanero(I can't remember which pepper hint it was)anyways that was good.  The customer service was amazing! Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter was knowledgeable and very attentive.  He even surprised us with banana pudding dessert! That was to die for! I can't wait to visit Midwood again"}
{"text":"A-Ok.... Let me just say, I LOVE THEIR CUBAN Sandwich!!! to die for... the only reason why they are getting 3 stars is because some of their staff SUCKS!!!!  I think I have called in about 8 times in the past for pick up orders, each time I say PLEASE put some napkins and silverware in because I like to eat out in the park or somewhere outdoors, therefor I cannot get my own fork!, all 6 times I've ordered, they don't ive me any napkins or silverware! it is becoming super annoying , there were few times that the waiter had a bad attitude and I was just about to call the manager because that was the same person who did not put napkins and silverware, the only thing you are supposed to do!!!"}
{"text":"The bbq chicken was moist tender, and oh-so-smoky.  Got the sampling platter and split it with my husband and it was almost too much for us.  BBQ beans were out of this world, the burnt ends are fantastic.  Ambiance was just perfect, the wait staff were friendly, fun, and on their toes.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"We were driving down Central Ave last night, looking for someplace to eat.  We figured we'd go to one of the places we've already been, when we spotted the Midwood Smokehouse.   It looked nice on the outside and there seemed to be people milling about, so we figured it must be good.    There was a 20-minute wait, so we sidled up to the bar for a drink.  During our stint at the bar, some stools opened up, so we sat down and were invited to dine there as well by the bartender.  Rather than wait longer and, since the restaurant was pretty much a bar atmosphere overall, we decided to go ahead and stay put.  I didn't really want an appetizer, but the bacon-wrapped jalapenos sounded delish!  That's when I noticed that they're available as a side item.  Woo hoo -- SOLD!    I ordered the small-sized version of the Carolina Pork plate (with vinegar-y BBQ sauce) and the jalapenos as my side.  Out came this big pile of shredded pork.  The sauce was served in a small ramekin on the side, which really isn't enough.  Be sure to request 2 or 3!   On the side were my jalapenos wrapped in bacon.  SO yummy!  And, actually, not very spicy.  The hush puppies that also came with the plate were delicious, too.    I really liked Midwood Smokehouse (possibly even more than -- dare I say it?)  Mac's Speed Shop.  They have great food, great prices (on food and drink), and a great atmosphere -- both indoors and out!  The bartender (sorry--I'm not good with names!) was super friendly and efficient, too."}
{"text":"I came in December for an interview and back now in April. I knew I can to make another stop here and they didn't disappoint. Had the Carolina Pork this time and it was amazing. 4 stars because the hush puppies need to be bigger"}
{"text":"Sunday I ate at the newest Midwood Smokehouse which had just opened a few days prior behind Park Rd Shopping Center. I am no stranger to this restaurant usually eating at the Plaza Midwood location. I usually get a BBQ plate but opted for a sandwich and fries this time. First of all, this particular location is way nicer than the PM location but each fit the area and clientele they cater to. They weren't very crowded so we were seated right away. Service was excellent but the best part was the BBQ sandwich. Mouth watering delicious!! My only little issue is with the fries. I love the mini crinkle-cut fries but they don't brown them enough. They were limp. I noticed the PM location was the same with their fries too. This wasn't always the case. Back when they first opened, the fries were cooked to perfection. Then suddenly, they decided that crispy fries weren't as important. This won't keep me from returning but I will opt for a different side now instead of the limp fries."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. I know people who have eaten at the Johnston Rd location and vowed they would never go back it was so bad. One can like a restaurant for various reasons. Atmosphere & location come in second to the food I would think.   Haven't been here in 5-6 months but was looking forward to the BBQ chicken and those golden mini crinkle fries they cook to perfection.   Well, things have changed in those 5-6 months. The sauce for the chicken now comes on side, and those mini crinkle fries were not so golden. In fact, they were 1 step from disgusting. Way undercooked. The chicken was good but it was way better when the sauce was seared into the meat. I don't normally eat the hush puppies but they turned out to be the best thing on the plate.   On a brighter note, the service was excellent. Drew (man bun) has been there a while and is top notch. But I'm not sure when I will return. There are so many new restaurants opening in Charlotte and I continue to be on the prowl looking for the ones that make me go WOW! Midwood has been knocked way down on my list after today."}
{"text":"I always bring out-of-town guests here for great BBQ and a good selection of local craft brews, and this place never disappoints. I would rate Midwood Smokehouse as the 2nd best BBQ joint in town, behind Bill Spoon's BBQ, but I'm sure some Charlotteans would disagree. Besides the pork BBQ, I really like the collards and vinegar-based slaw, which is getting harder to find nowadays. If you're looking for a fun place to have a beer and some great BBQ, Midwood BBQ should be at the top of your list."}
{"text":"As family we eat here atleast once a month. Don't miss the their burnt ends!! Best BBQ in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer with the boys..We were on our way to Sir Edmund's, saw Midwood and decided to just go there..We sat at the small bar(bout  8 stools)  Would probably be better to sit at a table /booth in the future, bar is right at the entrance and all the to go orders are handled there..Small but very good tap selection. Split a brisket sandwich with my son, tasty but a bit greasy & salty(Brisket is chopped, not sliced) Side of mac N cheese was very good..Looking forward to them coming to my neck of the woods in Birkdale next month.."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great places to get BBQ in Charlotte and this is one of my favorites! Whenever I have guests in town, or anyone asks me for a recommendation I always suggest it.   I love the Plaza Midwood location! It is a great atmosphere. Last time I went, I went with 2 girl friends and we split the BBQ platter. There was so much food. It was great!! Definitely a must visit in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I went for lunch the first time and decided that I would go with the small Carolina pulled pork BBQ and a side of cole slaw.  If you are going to a smokehouse, I thought I should start there.   Delicious!  Finally, good BBQ in Charlotte.  Smoky and tender.  The slaw was good and homemade.  A few tiny hush puppies the size of Tater Tots that were also tasty.  Some pickled onions to set it off a bit.   I got a small platter, and while I wouldn't call the portion generous, it was certainly enough.  But no leftovers :(  Service was very good, quick and responsive.  Friendly and well tended on drinks and checking to see if we needed anything.  I liked the presentation on real plates, vintage retro diner type, a nice touch.    I didn't realize that this was another Frank Scibelli restaurant until I signed on to write a review.   I am a big fan of Mama Ricotta's, Cantina, and Bad Daddy's Burgers formerly Big Daddy's  (great breakfast, if you haven't tried them).  I have high expectations for anything he is associated with.  Midwood didn't disappoint me.   I expect that it will only improve as they settle in.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.    We were lucky not to have to wait to be seated, but as more folks discovered this place sometimes there is a wait.  We sat outside at the picnic tables under umbrellas, which was really nice.   Bravo..  Maybe I should give it 5 stars after all.  Just for getting the Q right.  Okay - changed.  I originally gave 4 out of 5 only because I hadn't tried more of of the menu and based it  on one meal.   Sometimes I am disappointed because I know the BBQ can be superb, and sometimes it is too salty.  I raised it to five because I realized that since it opened, it is one of my favorite places for casual and the only place I want to go for BBQ.    I say it is the best in the area for BBQ."}
{"text":"Fantastic beers and BBQ here with excellent service. Having come from Pasadena CA, we expected a lot and they delivered here."}
{"text":"Woo! I finally made it to Midwood!  I love massive amounts of protein and I love massive amounts of BBQ sauce so I really dont know how I put off going to Midwood for so many years.   Two of us split the Combo platter and at first glance, we were worried it wasn't enough for us but my gosh, it was enough and it was fantastic! The brisket is some of the best I've had in Charlotte at a BBQ place, the pulled pork was great, and the ribs were 'fall-off-the-bone-so-freaking-great' yum. We also got pork but it was covered in the mustard sauce that I don't like so I unfortunately didn't get to try it (I was a bit surprised that it came with sauce on it already and sad I missed out on it).   I really liked the hushpuppies and there are some things I am really looking forward to trying in the future, such as the BBQ Queso. That just sounds delicious.   I am happy I finally went and was very pleased. I can't wait to go back. Of my BBQ restaurants I've tried in Charlotte (and there's been a lot), this is top 3, maybe top 2!"}
{"text":"Beautiful day to grab lunch and finally get to sit on the patio. Monday's are $3 NC drafts! Already off to a great start. We received outstanding service from our server Lorilee friendly, knowledgeable, and overall had a great vibe with us and other tables. I had the roadhouse burger which was outstanding the fries are enough to share with at least three people. My girlfriend enjoyed the bbq pork sandwich which didn't take long to finish. My first visit and it definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"The belly was so happy after this grub! I love the Carolina style BBQ with the vinegar flavors.  I tried the sampler and split it with my husband.  We tried the beef brisket, the sausage, the pulled pork, and the chicken.  My favorite was the pulled pork.  The chicken had a mayo looking dressing which I was not feeling so I recommend doubling on the pulled pork because you get 4 meat options on the sampler.  the sampler also includes 2 side orders.  We selected the collard greens and the BBQ beans both excellent!  Seriously love me some Carolina BBQ!!!  Be prepared to wait in line here...it's worth it."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after several attempts( they are always very busy and often have a wait). We were rewarded with some of the best BBQ in Charlotte and some of the best I've ever had. We got wings for an app, one Crispy one Smoked. They serve a full pound, not 6-8 like so many places. The wings were smaller because they were from locally sourced, NATURAL birds not pumped full of hormones. So a pound was probably 15 wings, plenty for sharing. The smoked wings were good but the Crispy were off the hook! Seriously some of the best I've had and I am a Wing Guy.  I got the burnt ends entree with hushpuppies and Collards. Good Lord everything was just insanely good. The burnt ends were sticky, smoky, and sweet with delicious bits of crispy fat. The Collards were the best I've had in Charlotte and all 4 of us agreed. Loaded w hunks of pork perfectly seasoned I could eat a bowl of this by itself!  Local beers on tap I had a Hop Drop n Roll and the ladies had an excellent hard cider. Service was good and friendly and the food was fast considering how busy they were.  Midwood Smokehouse is my new favorite BBQ spot in Charlotte I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We are from Texas and came to this place to have dinner due to a long layout on airport. I am glad that we did because food was amazing. My husband and I decided to order the pig out with ribs, double brisket, and sausage everything was splendid."}
{"text":"Caution: know when your body is full. This place is delicious. The brisket made me feel like I was back in Austin. Also had some pulled pork with the mustard and vinegar sauces and it was to die for. The pimento cheese fries as an app are so delicious, but before you know it you have eaten waaayyy more than you intended to. I enjoyed my lunch visit here so much. So much, in fact, that i went home and celebrated with a three hour nap. Solid, cozy place."}
{"text":"Ordered a St. Louis 1/2 rack with creamed corn.  The ribs were wet with a mild red sauce, hush pups were included.  The creamed corn was peppery goodness and the ribs were cut from a slim pig (not thickly covered in meat, they serve you more though to compensate), the hush pups were,... Wait for it... Meh.   The wait staff was busy and forgot butter for the pups, silverware for the creamed corn and largely ignored me. It could improve.  The sweet tea was excellent. I am a big boy and overall the meal was well portioned."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Being from Florida and traveling for a living I eat BBQ. A lot. This was by far a top 3 in the country. Burnt ends are the bomb. Brisket needs a fork only to slice.  Drew was a great server.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Order the brisket!  As a transplant from Texas, I can tell you that their Brisket, Sausage, and bacon-wrapped-jalapeños are just like home.  I had to ask for bread and pickles (which would have come standard in Texas) but other than that, I was very pleased with my dinner.  I ordered the brisket plate and added on some sausage.  My side was macaroni & cheese and it was ok.  Service was slow, but that was probably because of the server we had."}
{"text":"I've visited this chain at several of the locations and all are good for lunch or dinner. They menu has plenty of items for people that don't want to eat BBQ. Side are generous and all the food is fresh. I especially like the pickled onions that come with the pork plate."}
{"text":"Listen to your taste buds and.....                          Get the Brisket!!!  Best brisket in Charlotte. Bacon wrapped jalapeños pretty tasty as well and not too spicy."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest I grew up on Memphis, KC and St Louis BBQ and have never really liked the vinegary style of NC/SC q that I've had before. Since I'm in Charlotte I felt like I needed to revisit it and hit up Macs my first night out, got a tip from a local yelper (thx Greg) and made our way up to Midwood.   So I order the sample platter with the choice of four meats, we get the ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken instead of the sausage. Wife and I got the same meal (almost) at Macs. Can I settle the score? Just like it takes an out of towner to decide between Genos/Pats (it's Pats) Midwood is the better of the two. Not a blowout, but enough to pick a winner, would have picked the sausage over the chicken as neither of us were crazy about it. As people have noted, get those bacon jalapenos as both of your sides. Yowza.  Why not 5 stars? Sorry pal that's reserved for Pappys in St Louis or Central BBQ in Memphis. Midwood is a solid pick and am glad we got to hit it up during our stay here."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie....hands down! Yes, I can be critical and discerning, but I like a great hot dog as well as a great steak.....so here we go.  Thumbs up: server Ev (short for Evan.....a young woman) was patient, pleasant and very helpful. Prices were in line with a BBQ joint.  Thumbs down: the food is mediocre so not sure where the high star reviews are coming from?? Perhaps, when you only have fast food to compare it to then this stuff seems like a night out on the town with the Mrs. Brisket lacked a defined smoke ring and flavor, pulled pork was bland, chicken dry and ribs were decent. All of the meats and rest of the food was salty. They have three sauces and only one was decent. The NC vinegar sauce and the mustard sauce were nasty. Sides were frozen crinkle cut french fries, small dry hush puppies, etc. The menu has too many off shoots from traditional BBQ, which should have been my first clue. Go to Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, J Muellers or Franklins in Austin and you will see what real BBQ is. If you can't eat the meat without sauce and absolutely love it.....then it just sucks, plain and simple. Seems more like a bar than a real BBQ joint. Got sick from the food. Total waste of money taking a taxi to and from the airport during a layover for this!!! In fairness, I would say if you like bar food it is OK, but nothing special at all and certainly not worth a $40 round trip taxi fare.  Keep it simple and to the basics. If you can't make great BBQ then shut it down....please do not throw stuff on the menu like tacos, bacon wrapped jalapenos, etc. All you are doing is trying to mask your sub par meats (which should be the highlight. QUALITY ALWAYS WINS!!!!  And this ain't quality. It's BBQ Bar Food"}
{"text":"Drew was our waiter! 5 stars for him too! The food was authentic BBQ, all from scratch! I even tried the Moonshine! Rated #1 for a reason. Ate here based on reviews. I have to tell you, I've lived all over the mid & southern states and this is delish!"}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in Charlotte who suggested this place. I had never had Carolina BBQ actually in NC, so I was eager to try it. I had a rather basic meal, but it was quite tasty. I had the Carolina BBQ Plate, the pork was so tender, and the vinegar-based sauce was savory and slightly spicy. The service is very friendly, just what comes to mind when thinking of southern hospitality. Good beer selection, especially a lot of NC craft beers that you can't find in MD. Meals are a bit pricey for the portions, though, I was expecting to get a bit more food."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge bbq fan but this place is amazing. I had the pork bbq sandwich and it literally melts in your mouth. The pimento cheese fries are a must for an appetizer. The bbq baked beans are so flavorful as well as the sweet potato fries. We had great service and the prices are not outrageous. Go there! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good barbeque,  nice outdoor seating, and a decent beer selection.  We ordered plenty a ton of food, large combo platter, burnt ends, fried pickles, 5 sides,  and two desserts.  All of it was fantastic.  The burnt ends were the highlight followed up by the ribs. The meats had so much flavor,  which we were told was due to a wood burning smoker that ran 24 hrs a day.  We were told this was one of the few true wood burning smokers in town, which, if true is enough reason to eat here.  As for sides, all great with the stand outs being the super creamy mac & cheese and the bacon wrapped jalapenos.  They had roughly 10 local beers on the menu plus all your standard options. Desserts were good, but not the highlight."}
{"text":"Omg I just tried this place for the first time today and it was amazing! I only had a few small bites before coming to the conclusion that this is some great BBQ!! I am so glad I found this little treasure! I will most definitely be back again, again and again!!"}
{"text":"Our go-to BBQ in Charlotte. Tender, flavorful meat and great options for side dishes. The pecan pie is beyond AMAZING! Love love love this place. Soon they'll have to expand the seating, but thankfully they're grab-n-go service is high quality too!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places in Charlotte! The BBQ sammies, Mac and cheese, and pimento cheese fries? You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I give a place 5 stars. This place however, at 9:30 pm, still was serving amazing fresh food. I mean I deliberately asked for a salad and just to see how fresh everything was going to be, also asked for the beef brisket. Being that I have not eaten any red meat in about 6 months, this was breaking my own rules. But, I had to know. How was it you asked? Amazing! Simply succulent and as sweet as it could be. There are many places that give you this rushed and dried out barbecued meats... this place won't do that. They have somehow, perfected the art."}
{"text":"We stayed a night in Charlotte and naturally wanted some southern BBQ. This place showed up as highly rated so we went! The parking lot was packed but we found parking on the back side of the building. We decided to split the 'Well Fed' combo with ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. It didn't look like much food at first but ended up being enough for 2. The ribs were definitely the winner of the day. So tender and tangy; bbq'ed to perfection! Next up was the brisket, a little fatty but good nonetheless. The pulled pork was next; very tender and flavorful. I didn't really care for the pulled chicken. It lacked tenderness and flavor in my opinion. The Mac n cheese was delicious! Very cheesy! The sweet potato fries were tasty and crunchy. I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Our waitress was great. The space was great and there looked to be a rooftop deck as well."}
{"text":"Very good. So much food! I had the brisket, burnt ends, bacon wrapped jalapeños, and Mac and cheese. It was all really good!"}
{"text":"So good.   The 50/50 split of the beef brisket LITERALLY melts in your mouth.   My kids enjoyed everything as well.   The food is delicious and well prepared.  My wife loves their salads so she can get a green and a delicious lean.   Really good stuff.   The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The manager checked in on us to make sure that we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Solid and consistent BBQ. I love the brisket grilled cheese with the Mac n cheese. Great staff and service is always attentive."}
{"text":"The bbq sauces are fantastic for sure! They'd make even great food taste better. And you absolutely *must* try the baked beans! (unless you're vegetarian)  There's been a line (20-30 min wait) the two times I've been here for dinner but I don't see what the hype is about. Both times, the food was as good as what comes out of my kitchen and I didn't have to cook it so I suppose that makes me happy. The service was ok; the waitress was friendly and got everything right but it was a long time between table visits even when bringing condiments; I think they must have been short-handed. Bacon wrapped jalapeños were quite tasty but some were waaaay hotter than others. It was like 3 were poblano and two were real jalapeños seeds included. (I like it hot!) The turkey (special of the day) was nothing to write home about but it was definitely something I'd put on a sandwich for lunch the next day.  All in all, if you're looking for a new place to eat, check it out. You won't be sorry you came."}
{"text":"If had the pleasure to dine at their locations in Ballantine and plaza midwood. Both have set the bar extraordinarily high in terms of BBQ. The brisket is made to perfection. Their brisket sandwich is a must. Also try their smoked ribs. This will always be my go to spot."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The staff made every attempt to accommodate our large party (including our wheelchair using friend). A great atmosphere. Stunning BBQ that I'll never find the equal of back in NJ."}
{"text":"Called at 6:15 on a Friday night to order 2 lbs. of pulled pork and 1 lb. of lean brisket, and were told they were out of lean brisket, and to hold on to see if they had enough mixed brisket.  They came back to the phone and said they would not have any more pork for a few hours, and that they could not fill our order for brisket either.  We were not offered an alternative, and wound up driving across town to the always reliable Bill Spoon's BBQ.  How could a bbq place run out of two of their most popular items by 6:15 on a Friday night?!  Coincidentally, I just heard the other day that the cardinal rule of bbq is \"Don't run out\"....."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place continues to deliver the best customer service experience in town. Amanda was on point with multiple items going on at once. The bacon wrapped jalepenos appetizer was nothing short of a mouth watering delight. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"So being from out of town, I told myself that I definitely had to get BBQ before I left. Unfortunately, when you're participating in a wedding and staying about 35 minutes from the venue, time runs a bit short. Found this place on Yelp, and we were a little skeptical since it was out in the burbs, but being that we were so short on time, we figured burbs BBQ was better than nothing. Upon first walking in, it was a nice sized space, clean, and pretty modern in terms of decor. My first thought was, well, guess I'm at a chain. Boy could I not have been more wrong. We were seated quickly, and the service was fantastic. The server gave us a rundown on the history and the well known dishes (i.e. the brisket). We got a combination platter of ribs, burnt tips, brisket, and pulled pork. Sides of mac and cheese, beans, and greens. In terms of the sauces, they had a standard BBQ, Carolina vinegar based sauce, a Carolina mustard, and a habanero BBQ.   The brisket was all it was cracked up to be. There was a nice pink ring from the smoking. There was a nice juiciness to it from the fat. Great smoke flavor that did not need sauce at all. Adding the vinegar sauce to the pulled pork definitely enhanced its flavor. The pork was already so tender. The burnt ends though, wow. So tender, smoky, and filled with flavor. The ribs had a nice dry rub to them and were fall off the bone tender. The greens were tender but not completely fall apart, perfect for my liking. Mac and cheese wasn't mind blowing but good. The beans had some chunks of pork in them that enhanced the flavor. I was completely wrong with my assumptions. I would definitely visit again if down in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte.....  Maybe.  4.5 star restaurant, not even close IMO.  I don't get the hype at all.  Better than Mac's and most of the well known competition in town, but that isn't saying much.  Charlotte is a desert for solid southern BBQ.  The jalapeno poppers are good.  I'm down whenever.  The wings are pretty good.  Although, I'd rather have McCoy's smoke house if that was the only reason I was going.  The combo options seem to be the best deal if you have more than 3 or so people.  Get the brisket, get the ribs and then whatever else suits your fancy.  Bottom line.  I'll be back.  But, it wouldn't be hard for another place to sway my vote for best BBQ in the queen city."}
{"text":"My favorite barbecue spot in Charlotte - and not because of the meat! If you anything like me, you love sides. Mid wood has the option to create a meal entirely comprised of their side dishes (aka my dream come true.) Their macaroni & cheese and baked beans alone keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Tied w/ Sauceman's for best bbq in Charlotte."}
{"text":"BBQ was good and the service was top notch.  We didn't like the brisket as much as the other meats.  The cole slaw was on the warm side which is never attractive to a southerner.  Baked beans were ok.  Definitely worth a second try if we're in the area."}
{"text":"The brisket was on point, I even used the word fantastic!! My wife was like wha??? Very hard to please me with brisket. Great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Best Texas style beef brisket and ribs East of Texas besides Judge Roy Bean's in Brentwood,  Tennessee.  Great variety of beers , good bloody Mary's and Atmosphere"}
{"text":"So... we bought the Party Pack for 8-10 people for our Father's Day brunch which totaled $81 after tax. The meal that we received will certainly not be enough to feed 8-10 people (more like 4 but certainly not 8 people and no where near 10 people) and was way overpriced. We are disappointed with this purchase and will think long and hard before we purchase any Party Pack from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We were super excited to see the Midwood Smokehouse sign go up so close to where we leave, almost immediately after visiting the Central location. We really liked the food, but didn't like the layout of the Central location.   A few weeks after opening (and getting their liquor license) we stopped by on a Thursday afternoon to get dinner. The dining room had a wait so we sat at the bar. The bar staff works so hard to make all of the drinks and deliver food to the bar guests. We ordered the sampler platter which is 4 meats and 2 sides + hush puppies and pickled onions. In our experience we find that it is best to get the following: pulled pork, pulled pork (x2), ribs, and brisket (combo lean and fatty) along with another order of hush puppies, and macaroni and cheese. We would get another rib vs. another pulled pork however, it costs extra and we are cost efficient.   The ribs are so good, fall off the bone, doesn't need sauce kind of good. The brisket is so good, my husband, (who said he doesn't like brisked) ate his fair share. We got 2 orders of hush puppies because they are worth it. And the mac and cheese, which I am the queen of picky, was gone. Like poof, where did the macaroni go? Kind of gone.   This is also the perfect share with another meal. And they have OMB Copper. And they have BYOM (bring your own mug) night.   Go there. But don't take our seat at the bar."}
{"text":"I did the  Beef Brisket, Chicken BBQ, Smoked Veggies and Crinkle Cut Fries. Of the two, the chicken was by far the better as the brisket was way to fatty. I mean, I like to have some fat on the meat, but when the fat to meat ratio is more fat, it seems like a waste. The smoked veggies, maybe it was because it was the end of the day, but I did not bother to eat them, they just tasted gross. Of course the fries were good!  Overall, I would come here to eat the chicken again and maybe try the burnt ends or the pulled pork,"}
{"text":"Best beef brisket sandwich I've ever had. Mac and cheese was pretty awesome. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Unreal. Food, service, ribs, Mac and cheese, atmosphere... 100%  Our server Kathy was nice and fun and playful, but always kept our drinks full and was great with my kids.  The food... wow... we had a Pig Out plate and it fed 4 of us. So so good! And the banana pudding was amazing!"}
{"text":"Burnt ends weren't cooked to a high enough temp and didn't have a great bark. Way off the mark. The service was great and atmosphere is too. I'll have to give something else a try."}
{"text":"So I am definitely one that seeks out authentic bbq in any southern city I visit for work or play. I happened to be in Charlotte for work and knew I had to stop by one of the Midwood locations. They are a brisket house by far, meaning they are a Texas style bbq.  I ordered the four meat combination platter to try everything. I selected the brisket, chopped pork, pulled chicken, and the pork ribs. By far the brisket was the best of the bunch, even though everything was quite tasty. The brisket was melt in your mouth. I selected half lean and half fatty for the brisket. Paired with Mac n cheese and cole slaw, I enjoyed every bite! Come hungry! Definitely will make another trip here."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is the best BBQ in Charlotte. We had a bad experience here a couple years ago, but family kept going back so we wanted to give it another chance. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. The BBQ queso was not good at all. Looked and tasted like microwaveable dip from a jar. The tortilla chips were somehow stale, oily and unsalted all at the same time. I got the grilled cheese with pork which subsequently turned into a BBQ sandwich with half a piece of cheese. If you're going to call it a grilled cheese - it should be ooey gooey - just saying. Also did not taste or see the grilled onions and creamy tomato sauce it was supposed to come with. My boyfriend got the brisket plate. It was dry, tough, and completely overcooked. That's the first time I've ever seen him leave brisket on a plate. Service was bottom five I've ever had. We live right around the corner, but would much rather drive to Mac's than come here ever again. Mac's has bigger portions, better food and wayyyy better service for the same price."}
{"text":"A fun place for BBQ. Nice southern style traditional food. Do not go here if you are watching your calories. Finding a healthy option is nearly impossible."}
{"text":"As I've said in other reviews, I almost never give 5 stars, not trying to sound like a snob, but this place deserves it. Great, real wood fired BBQ as well as the typical smokehouse fare. It's right off Central Avenue, the location is a bit odd in an older area of town, with some newer apartments across the tracks and some older cottages behind it. Be on the lookout if you're driving, it's tucked back so it can be easy to miss. Accessible by bus and hopefully streetcar soon, maybe 10 mins from uptown, so a good option if you're visiting without a car. Staff is polite, food is great, decent prices. The ONLY complaint I have, and that really has nothing to do with the establishment itself is that parking is very limited. I'm not one who feels entitled to a parking space everywhere I go, but you may have to circle the block a bit, the city doesn't tow this area though, so unless someone calls you should be alright."}
{"text":"My friends and I finally made it to Midwood and we were very pleased with our visit.   After a short wait we were seated and ordered some beers (they have excellent specials) while we checked out the menu. Everything sounded so delicious but I decided to go with the burnt ends and bacon wrapped jalapeños.  The burnt ends (chopped brisket) come doused in their signature home made fat tire sauce. They were delicious. The sauce was spicy and smokey! A truly great combination of flavors! And those damn Bacon Wrapped Jalapeños were outstanding. I mean any time you combine two of my personal faves it's got to be good, but the crispy bacon and stuffed jalapeños delighted my taste buds in so many ways! I only wish there were more on the plate!!!   There's so many things here I'm looking forward to try! The one downside is parking. It's just not enough here! But if you can find a parking spot, this place is definitely worth a visit! I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service makes or breaks a restaurant.  There was a healthy wait and we found a couple of spots at the bar. The bartender Pamela did what I consider best practices. She introduced herself along with everyone else behind the bar and said to please ask anyone if we'd like something. That's just good , smart service. We ordered drinks from the drink menu. I asked the bartender for a recommendation. Her favorite was a BeeSting. I thought I may have to wrestle my wife for it. I am happy to do that.  Really good! We ordered the sampler plate. (The smaller one) we both ate from it and have healthy portions to bring home. Highlights were the pork, brisket , ribs , mac & cheese & collard greens. Wait ... Thats everything. They had a vinegar soaking in peppers for the collard greens . Whoa! Almost forgot jalapeños with cheese wrapped in bacon.... Seriously!  Friendly service, great food. We will be back with friends."}
{"text":"Great food! The wait time was not a big problem. And the use of Yelp to track the wait time was perfect. My husband was able to drink his stout beer and we could enjoy the lovely evening. The atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Have been to midwood a few times now and have loved the food each time! The service is good and the staff is very friendly. Any place that serves great BBQ and keeps a cold beer in front of me is tops on my list!!"}
{"text":"I've sampled my fair share of barbeque from many different styles up and down the east coast and out west as well and Midwood Smokehouse can definitely compete with these guys.   This place was already filling up 11:45 am on a Friday morning. It was a beautiful day so we snagged a spot on the outdoor patio and immediately start gawking at all the delicious-looking plates around us.  I decided on the blue cheese brisket sandwiched served between two pieces of Texas toast and the boyfriend ordered the half rack f rib special but substituted the BBQ spaghetti with mac n cheese.  The sauces same out way ahead of time from the food which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine especially when you are really anxious for your meal. Of course I sampled each one alone and new exactly which combination of each I like. The mustard-based sauce and then Midwood sauce were my favorites. We were surprised how long we had to wait for our meals as barbeque usually comes out pretty quick, but to be fair, they were pretty busy.  Everything was pretty darn good. The sweet potato fries were most impressive to me (I'm very picky about my fries) and the brisket sandwich was very good as well. The ribs were not necessarily \"fall off the bone\" but the smoky rub was outstanding. The mac n' cheese was nothing to swoon over.  Next time I come back I'll definitely need to try a traditional pulled pork BBQ sandwich along with the delicious sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Placed a to-go order this evening at the Park Road location. We ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs, however mgr comes out to tell us all out so would we like a beef rib instead. He thanked us profusely- now we know why. Charged us $30, twice the price. Shame on us for not questioning the ole bait & switch"}
{"text":"Hands down best food and best service in Charlotte! Every time I eat at this place my facial hair grows a little more every time, my voice gets deeper, and I suddenly get the urge to fight bears and eat brass. This place just makes a man out of you."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with my family at this location. The service was great and the food very tasty.  Hubby and I ordered the well fed item to share which was enough for the two.  Kids had chicken tenders.  Impressed with the serving size of the kids portion.  Love best of all the hickory smoked sausage, baked beans which have been the best I ever had and the chopped Carolina pork.  We definitely will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. Great service. My two favorites were the burnt ends and smoked sausage with mustard."}
{"text":"Being from Arizona I am not qualified to rate NC BBQ. This was the only BBQ joint we tried while visiting. It was so good!   We had the brisket, burned bits, and the pulled pork. Everything tasted amazing. We did have to wait about an hour to get seated on a Saturday night, but since we were on vacation we didn't mind. I really wanted to try dessert but I was so full I couldn't eat anything else. I will return to Arizona and dream of returning to have more NC BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Awesomely delicious!  My husband and I visit Midwood at least once a week, it is SOOO good!  We have taken all of our out of town guests here and had them cater our Christmas Eve dinner last year.   They smoke everything onsite andy ou can smell the meat cooking as soon as you step out of your car.  The bbq and brisket are fantastic and they have the best pulled chicken I've ever had.  They have a few sauces onhand so you can have thick, mustard or vinegar sauce to accompany your meal.   I love getting the Midwood Chopped Salad and I usually add the pulled chicken to it.  The salad is filled with grilled corn, black beans, avocado, cucumbers and freshly grated cheddar cheese. Another favorite meal to order are the tacos- you can mix and match so you can try bbq, pulled chicken and/or brisket at the same time.  The mac and cheese and creamed corn are out of this world.   Plan your visit now, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food was good. We started with smoked wings as an app. For entrees we had smoked brisket  (they give you the option of lean, fatty or mixed, I chose mixed) and the ribs and chicken combo. Everything was good. Loved the fries... yummy. My man had the beans he said they had alot of meat in them. We ate it all (lol). The service was fast and Gary was the best server. Try it...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to do carry out! This was my first and only taste of North Carolina que and it was a solid choice. The place was completely packed, even for carry out! I'd recommend ordering online bc it's faster. Only thing is the combo platter wasn't an option so I waited until I got there to order mine and I had to wait a bit. Macaroni was to die for and I loved the spicy bbq. Combo platter was enough to feed 2-3 people so recommend sharing that one :)"}
{"text":"Y'all.  I can make my own salad here with up to seven (7) toppings. S-E-V-E-N.  This is the spot that J and I can 100% agree on whenever we \"don't know what we want/don't care/too lazy to cook/life is insane sometimes...\"   I have to say I haven't really ventured far from my SEVEN-topping salad extravaganza. Poor J has to listen to me every time. He's always like, are you done yet?  Midwood is so solid. I absolutely love their smoked chicken on top and have also enjoyed the pork. Service is usually pretty good here, too, which I feel is always hit or miss at a BBQ place.  On the weekends, be prepared to wait. They offer a couple (literally, like 2) brunch options on the weekend, which sometimes I wish was expanded, but I have to remember its a BBQ spot first and foremost, not a breakfast place.  We have also ordered takeout from here for a small group and it was a hit. Word of advice: over-order on the wings...they will be the first to go!  Okay it's only 7:45 a.m. as I write this and I know I just wrote about how I wish they did breakfast, but now I am really just craving BBQ."}
{"text":"This place has the best barbecue in Charlotte or anywhere else I have personally visited."}
{"text":"Well I gave take out here another chance and all I can say is check your order thoroughly before you leave because they don't.  In addition, the smoked wings were  undercooked, rubbery and not fall off the bone tender as they usually are."}
{"text":"Omg. Great Q. Green goddess dressing was perfect. Brisket was cooked perfectly. Our server Jaime was attentive and friendly. Atmosphere was great for talking.  We went last year on our yearly visit and loved it enough to come back at our next visit. The bbq sauces had a lot flavor - made the whole meal. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Smoked salmon is super tasty!  I sided it with the veggies which were equally as good.  And the hush puppies?!?! YUMMY!!  The service was really good.  They get very busy around mealtime so plan on a little wait.  Well worth the wait!  Good selection of local beers too."}
{"text":"Though it's a BBQ joint this place has one of the best salads around! Must try the Midwood Chopped salad and selection of local beers is awesome."}
{"text":"The food and service is pretty good. I've been to this place a few times. The place is nicely decorated, clean blah blah blah, you get it, it's nice. However, the BBQ is GOOD but NOT GREAT. I've definitely have had better BBQ but this place is pretty good. We've always order the Big BBQ ( I think that's what it's called) because its for a larger party but its great because you can sample pretty much all the meats on the menu. I just think I'm a bit critical because I have had better BBQ.Its great for big or small groups and the location is ideal. This is one of those places where you can go out to dinner and then check out Plaza Midwood by foot, perhaps go bar hopping (like I  have in that area)."}
{"text":"The food and the large portions were good and filling, except for the house salad already heavily laced with pepper when it arrived. If I want to spice my food, please allow me to it. The music was insanely loud and I had great difficulty hearing what my friends were saying right across the table from me. If the music level goes down, then people won't have to be constantly yelling at each other in order to be heard. Thank you."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time! When you go in ask for Donny he is the best server!. The pork ribs are amazing."}
{"text":"BBQ and Hush puppies hush puppies.....Every combo comes with hush puppies and it was so good. We ordered the choose 4 combo that comes four meats we chose a double order of BBQ with brisket  and smoked sausage. Our sides were the mac and cheese and collard greens. I must say everything was outstanding and they have the best BBQ I have ever had. They give the restaurant 12-Bones a run for there money, I must say. I highly recommend this place if you love BBQ and comfort food."}
{"text":"So glad I chose Midwood as my one BBQ stop on my short trip to Charlotte. Cool vibe & real BBQ atmosphere; sat at the bar & had Matt as my server...he could not have been my gracious in helping with my selections & informing me of everything I needed to know about Midwood.  Had the 4 meats of ribs, burnt ends, pork & brisket. Though all were excellent, the brisket was incredible; perfect fatty/lean ratio, tender & the perfect char.    Sides were a unique option of bacon wrapped cheese stuffed jalapeños (very interesting & tasty) & quite honestly, one of the greatest things I've ever eaten in the baked beans. More like a chili, these beans were moan-worthy, seriously!  All four sauces were great; vinegar based Carolina style, my favorite was the traditional, watery base, followed by the mustard based.  For only a couple more bucks, Matt sold me on the banana pudding, which I ate after I got back to Atlanta for dessert...so creamy, light & yummy!  Thanks again to Matt & Preston at the bar, the assistant GM for checking in with me & the phenomenal pit master for a memorable BBQ experience in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The brisket is the best I've had anywhere. I've been to several well known BBQ spots, but this brisket has them all beat. You also have to try the Jack Daniels cocktails and the bacon wrapped jalapenos!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at The Ballantyne location. I have to say it's so much easier to get in and out of then my usual location on Central Avenue. Parking is so much easier too. The size and seating here is much roomier and more accommodating for different size dining parties. A hostess greeted me immediately and the waitress appeared as soon as I sat down. I found my favorite chopped pork salad to be just as delicious here. I still think it's odd they don't have crackers or bread available with their salads."}
{"text":"This place is insanely good. This may be the best BBQ restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I have traveled around the nation and been to many. This place takes the top spot. I'm here for work and got the \"well fed\" you choose 4 meat and two sides. The ribs are tender and flavored to perfection. The burnt ends are a house favorite and they didn't disappoint. The sausage and the brisket were also incredible. Sometimes at other restaurants the brisket is dry or even too salty. This place does it very well. Lots of flavor without being too salty and it is not dry at all. The ribs were by far my favorite. For sides I got mac and cheese and jalapeño poppers. The mac and cheese is basic and didn't take my breath away but the jalapeño poppers were awesome! They take a huge one and wrap it with a full strip of bacon and I loved every bite! Come hungry for sure. The staff was incredible especially the lady at the bar. It was so good I came back again the next night. SOOOO GOOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Both in quality and quantity of the food. The waiter, I wish I remembered his name, was really nice and really helpful. Nice atmosphere, literally melt in your mouth brisket, and attentive staff mean this place earned all five stars in my book."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte. I usually get the sampler (around $20)  that comes with your choice of 4 meats and 2 sides and split that with my wife. Easily enough food for two people ... depending on your appetite you may even come home with leftovers. The bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers are an absolute must. Easily the highlight of my meal --- also their brisket is on pointttt. A great atmosphere and fun place to come with a small group of friends for dinner."}
{"text":"This was my first visit so can't compare it to the original location.  The place is nice, open and clean. The server was pleasant and attentive. Had the burnt ends and the sauce was really tasty.  Could have dealt with less fattiness. The macaroni and cheese was creamy, cheesy and browned cavatappi (corkscrew) deliciousness.  Was too full for dessert, but have to return and try the pecan cobbler."}
{"text":"Came here to get some chopped pork and collard greens. Sad to say the food is touch or go. Ordered the sampler which had ribs, pulled porked, pulled chicken and brisket. The ribs were really good seasoned to perfection. Didn't really care for the brisket as much but the pulled pork and chicken was good. They also have a unique mustard sauce that's out of this word. The Mac and cheese was half done and cold and the other sides were just okay. Five stars for the banana pudding very good!."}
{"text":"Excellent mac and cheese! Great sauces. But to be honest, Mac's speed shop has better pulled pork."}
{"text":"We walked in with a group of 10 -- on a Saturday night at 7:45, not the best strategy. But we were seated in only 20 minutes at two tables (6+4) -- probably as good as we could have hoped for. The staff was very accommodating and friendly from the moment we stepped in.  The beer selection was good, solid -- just fine for casual dinner. Our table had fried pickles for an appetizer and they were delicious -- crispy on the outside and cut on the diagonal to give lots of area for dipping.  The barbecue I had was incredible. Their brisket can stand up to anything I've had in a Texas restaurant. I had their signature sauce which was a smoky, sweet & tangy (more tang than sweet) mixture, on a combination of lean and fatty brisket. I was floored by how delicious it was. I also had the bacon-wrapped jalapenos as a side. Do be cautious with these -- they vary in terms of hotness (seeds, most likely). The first I had was mild and the second knocked me for a loop! But totally enjoyable. The collard greens were also solid -- not mind-blowing, but very good. The portions were very generous and there's no way to leave this place hungry after a platter.  A dining companion, in fact, ordered a platter and couldn't begin to finish his pulled pork. He offered me a taste. It was tossed in the spicy BBQ sauce already. I had a few mouthfuls, and they were exquisite. I wish I'd been able to taste with the vinegary NC sauce I love so much -- maybe next time!  The service was excellent and our waitress brought a smile to the table every time she came by to check on our progress and offer refills. I was so full of good cheer and barbecue that I was halfway planning already to come back the next night. Definitely worth a visit for a casual dinner with friends -- I would love to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have been here plenty of times for take out, as well as with big friend groups and even two work lunches. This place is really good.   I am not a bbq expert like reviewers claiming they are super pro, I just like it frequently and I am really picky about how it tastes. Midwood serves just the right sauces with everything.  Sauce is basically my favorite part of the meal and these guys nail it. I love getting the hush puppies with the regular bbq sauce, or the thin vinegar nc style sauce with the pork.   And I don't see a lot of people mentioning this, but ... the bbq chicken with the SC style mustard sauce, is probably my #1 favorite. It's so tasty.  Also important: The staff have invariably been courteous and friendly to me, even when I show up 15 minutes before closing to please get a to go sandwitch. They never make me feel like it's the end of the night or anything, I get the same bright cheer I would at 7 pm.   And 1/2 price nc drafts on mondays is pretty much the best. basically this place is great."}
{"text":"Oh..... my.......dear..... lord.... This was..... amazing. This.... THIS is why I search out  good  Q it's just.... sublime. Ok let's see, I had the small platter... SMALL mind you and I couldn't finish it. It came with 4 meats. I got the pulled pork (really dang good, pour just a little of their vinegar based sauce on it to put it over the top) Brisket (they ask you how fatty you want it it was .... oh my god ... it was awesome) Sausage (it's sausage how could it be bad?) Ribs (OMG ribs they come with a dry rub DON'T YOU DARE POUR SAUCE ON THOSE RIBS ok you can put sauce of the ribs but try them without sauce the rub is really good) Sides I got the mac and cheese (if you're sensitive to salt you might think it's too salty I thought it was good) and the beans (they  were good with an interesting pork and peppery flavor). I've drug my poor mom to three BBQ places in as many days so she got a salad and was VERY happy with it (lots of different kinds of lettuce no iceberg, roasted corn etc etc). I tasted the shredded chicken on top and it was tasty and not at all dry.  We had some hushpuppies before the meal they were very good served with their signature tomato based sauce (which is GOOD I took a pint home with me). They have a great beer selections and they even have a few vegetarian options (something called a black bean burger?? and mom says they had three different salads. I dunnow I'm a carnivore) We asked because my sister is a vegetarian  and the waitress was right on top of what they had that was vegetarian so if you have a friend who prefers killing plants to animals and you can drag them in the door they won't starve. Service was fast and very friendly they totally kept on top of keeping me in drink. I'm going to try REAL hard to make it back before I leave town. So much more to try there. And guys.. (by that I mean men) use their bathroom.... just trust me on this.   If you're a local and you haven't been here  WHY ON EARTH HAVEN'T YOU BEEN HERE?   If you'e not a local and you're just passing through seriously give them a try."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and Mac's as the place to go for BBQ and I have to say I was pretty impressed. The ribs especially were amazing. My friend and I got the sampler platter with ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. I think we also got sides of Mac and cheese, collard greens and hush puppies. The collard greens were gross but it's also the first time I've tried collard greens so maybe I just don't like them period. Hush puppies were good and Mac and cheese was okay, a little under flavored. But let's talk BBQ! The ribs were by far the best. Next time I come it will definitely be for those. They were well seasoned and very tender. Other BBQ was pretty good. I'd probably say the pulled pork was next best then brisket then chicken. If you've never been before sampler is a nice way to go but if you just want some good food get the ribs!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Midwood Smokehouse! We just moved to Charlotte and after a day of moving furniture with my family and friends we were in some serious need of food. I did a quick yelp search and decided to head over and pick up food for all of the helpers!   Came in and placed a large to-go order consisting mostly of pulled pork sandwiches, which everyone enjoyed. The best part was all of the different sides! I think that we were able to try most of the options but the stars were the mac-n-cheese, the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the potato salad. It was even super delicious the following day when we reheated the leftovers!!  I do have to give a special thanks to the bartender who went through the bag to verify all of our food was included before we left. Had he not we would have been one sandwich short and that would not have been good! So, thanks for being so thorough!   Fast forward 2 weeks, the house is all unpacked and my husband and I are craving the BBQ again. This time we decided to actually eat in. The service was top notch and the food amazing. I stuck with the pulled pork and the husband went with the special which was a brisket taco with spicy slaw (SO GOOD!!!). We were both really happy with our choices and left full, with to go cups for our iced teas. I always think this is nice, especially after a big meal like BBQ!   I will def be returning and even as I'm writing this review, I'm wondering if I will be able to convince the hubs to go tonight!"}
{"text":"Apparently, Obama and Hilary beat me to this place.  I got here though and when I did, I had the chopped salad topped with burnt brisket tips. I also tried the Bramble - which is a cocktail made with blackberry moonshine. Both were delicious! I went with a group so this was a table of 7 and service was pretty good - there were no long delays and our drinks were refilled as expected.   Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Food was so so. Drinks were small and expensive. My lady had a Cuban sandwich. Very chewy mostly bread. I am part Cuban, this was nowhere near. I had the daily special, rib meat tacos and a side salad. Asked that the salad come out first. It didn't. All came out together. The soft taco shells were cold, meat had zero flavor although it was semi tender. Drinks were seven dollars a piece, very small and lacked the vodka for the seven bucks. Hush puppies were ok, mostly cold. Side salad with Tomato Vinaigrette was plenty full and tasty. When asked by server how meal was I told here a disappointment. She sent manager over. Nice lady who listened and made our complaint feel welcomed. When I mentioned the drink she said she was aware and was waiting for bigger glasses. Nice atmosphere inside, clean with a 95 score. With so many places to choose from in the Ballantyne area this will not get my repeat business."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of really great things about this place before I finally went. Needless to say I really wanted to like it and to finally find decent barbecue in Charlotte. Unfortunately my meal was just average. I got the brisket platter with mashed potatoes, stuffed jalapeños, and hush puppies. The BBQ sauce itself was okay. The brisket average quality average taste. The mashed potatoes were a special and it was weird they served them with turkey gravy. I wish they would've asked if I wanted gravy because I would've said no. Turkey gravy and brisket is a bad combo. Hush puppies were excellent. Jalapeños were okay... Not a huge fan. The pecan cobbler with ice cream was ridiculously good! Service was excellent. I still prefer a long drive to Lancasters."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the bbq salads here! This dish is unlike any found at other restaurants. Thankfully you can buy half portions because it would be a real shame to waste any of a full portion. The original restaurant on Central Avenue is closest to me but I'm looking forward to trying the new location at Ballantyne. It can be very discouraging to see a huge crowd waiting to get in but I've never had to wait longer than 15-20 minutes. Once seated the wait staff is quick and efficient. Excellent prices for delicious and ample meals."}
{"text":"Went to Midwood looking for the elusive eastern Carolina bbq.  Oh...  I found it.  And this was an experience I'll never forget.  This was the best bbq I've had since visiting a po dunk grandma bbq joint in wake forest.  I am in bbq nirvana.  The sauces are amazing. The had sweet,  spicy,  mustard and vinegar.  Just what I was looking for.   I can't wait to come back. Can we get one of these in California.?"}
{"text":"Fair quality food, horrible wait staff, very stuck up waitresses and bartenders.  They bartenders at this location all act like they are better than you, and the same goes for the waitresses, it is a shame that they act like that when they are depending on tips as their income.  The food quality is ok, they do use the cheap ketchup though, and also charge extra money for such small things as ranch sauce.  If you can skip this place I would recommend doing that.  They do have multiple locations."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse has excellent, 5 star fatty brisket and mostly good other items.   My family of 6 (5 adults + 1 kid) split a Pig Out combo platter, 2 tacos, and a few sides.   Pig Out Platter with...  - Brisket (fatty): Amazing! So flavorful, moist without being gross like I've had at other places. Probably the best I've had.  - St Louis Style Pork Ribs (dry): A lot of nice smoke flavor in the ribs. I liked them even better when I added sauce which is an option but my dad prefers dry.  - Carolina Chopped Pork: The weakest item in the platter. Texture was good, but the taste wasn't there.   - Hickory Smoked Sausage: Good, nice flavor and texture. The brisket and ribs were good enough that I wish we had just gotten 2x brisket and 2x ribs though!   Stockyard Tacos - Why order tacos at a BBQ place? I think the answer is, \"Don't let kids order anything.\" Somehow the addition of all the taco toppings made the brisket less interesting, not more.   Sides - Hush Puppies: I really liked these hush puppies. Nice crunch on the outside, soft inside, and buttery corn flavor. The only downer was how few we got. The platter came with hush puppies, and we also ordered a side of them, but we still only got about 9.  - Mac & Cheese: Not great. Dry without any strong cheese taste.  - BBQ Baked Beans: Really good! Hearty and meaty.  - Creamed Corn: I've never had this before so I can't really compare it to any other versions, but I liked it. Very rich.  - Collard Greens: They were collards... not much else to say. As good as others I've had.  - Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos: They tasted mostly of bacon. No taste of the peppers themselves or the cheese that was inside.  - Sweet potato fries: A very generous amount of fries. I love sweet potato fries and this was no exception.   The only other weak point to mention is that for a BBQ place, they're surprisingly stingy with the sauce. My whole family had to split 4 small containers of sauce (like takeout ketchup sized). It was busy so it was hard to get more. Even after asking mid-meal, we didn't get any more until our server came by to pack up our leftovers. I've mostly been to places where the containers are just on the table. If you like sauces, ask for more at the start.   Overall: delicious brisket, generous portions, and friendly service with a few minor issues. I'll definitely be back again the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If it's good for the Prez and future Prez as well as Secret Service, 'nuff said.  I have enjoyed their entrees for the last couple of years."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped jalapeños were exceptional as an appetizer. The brisket was also very good, tender and not over smoked. Creamed corn and smoked vegetables were yummy!! Jackie was a great waitress, friendly, and knowledgeable. I'll be back next time I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"I'm a native Carolinian and this is, hands down, the best BBQ I've had in my life. The brisket is tender and delish and the chopped pork is amazing. I love the Flat Tire Sauce and well as the vinegar based one. Our service was friendly and fast, even though they were slammed for Father's Day. Definitely a must try if you love your Cue!"}
{"text":"Bit of a wait even with call ahead but the food was very good.  Build your own salad was fresh and full of the add ins we picked.  Smoked chicken was excellent - tender, juicy puled chicken.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket small plate with baked beans through postmates & wasn't quite sure what to expect. I did look through the Yelp pictures & saw the brisket. It looked amazing. When I received my order- it was mouthwatering deliciousness. The brisket melted in my mouth & the BBQ Baked beans were the best I've had this year. I also saw the banana pudding pictures & had to order it. It was very delicious but very rich so make sure you have someone to share it with. I can't wait to go in person to this spot to have more of its amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Best southern food I have had in charlotte to date! I ordered the small plate brisket which includes the hush puppies, pickled onions (yummm) and one side- I ordered the BBQ Baked Beans & I also had the banana pudding. I had it delivered via postmates - it said the wait would be about an hour to have it delivered but I got the food within 35-40 mins. When I received the food, it was heavenly. The entire meal felt like it just came out of the kitchen & was the perfect temp. The meal was superb & omg the desert! It's delicious but very rich so make sure to share it with someone! I can't wait to visit in person the next time I am in the mood for some good southern cooking!"}
{"text":"This was rather hard to find and parking was limited, otherwise it would be 5 stars. Staff was friendly and all worked together to ensure you had what you needed. Sides were delish! As for BBQ, not bad but I have to say a wee bit dry for my likes. Try the crazy bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers, and amazing hush puppies. Creamed  corn was a favorite for our table."}
{"text":"Yep. Thank goodness this place replaced Smoke. Great barbecue, great ambiance, great beer selection."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The food was delicious. The servers could have been a bit more attentive in the beginning. After it was brought to their attention, things got better, including a complimentary appetizer."}
{"text":"The Pulled Chicken BBQ,  Mac-n-Cheese, and Midwood Chopped salad were delish!  The Sweet tea is good here too if you are a native southerner...otherwise you may want to cut it with unsweet tea.   Next time, I have to try the Habenaro sauce and remember to save room for banana pudding for dessert!  For your next big party or corporate event, you may want to check out their catering and bulk pick up options."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and variety of other foods. I had a salad and it was huge! Definitely get the bacon wrapped jalapeños! Does tend to get very busy and doesn't take reservations."}
{"text":"Decent food but not traditional bar b que.  They took some short cuts with the burnt ends."}
{"text":"Look, I am someone who actually knows what food is supposed to taste like.  I have read some of these reviews and wow, maybe they have been eating Mickey d's mcrib  for years to have thought this was good bbq.   Ribs came out with almost no meat, it was all like burnt and sauceless.  We sent them back and they came out  A LITTTTTLE bit better.  Sides were good (forget which ones we had since this was a couple months ago).  All in all, sucked and go to BOBBIE O'S on old statesville, it blows away this joke of a place as well as macs or lancasters.  it only seats like 8 people tho and is hot as hell inside so do takeout if u have a few people."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my meal at Midwood.  After all of the rave reviews and multiple recommendations from others in Charlotte, I was expecting really good BBQ.  I'd say the sides were better than the BBQ.  I got the pulled pork and brisket.  It was under flavored.  The BBQ sauce was decent, but it just wasn't good enough to season the underflavored meat.  The creamed corn and the pecan pie were the stars of the meal.  The hush puppies were dry and flavorless.  The baked beans were good too.  Overall, a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Combine queso cheese and pulled pork / brisket with chips for an appetizer and you're off to a great start, just hope you are still hungry for the main course! Brisket was so tender, it fell apart with a fork; I would however suggest the lean form brisket option as the *some fat* option was mostly that, fat. Would recommend overall."}
{"text":"The brisket was great. Ordered the fatty pieces. It was juicy and had great flavor.   Burnt ends on the other hand were subpar. Some of the pieces were quite dry (like turkey) and tough to eat.   I'd say it's a little better than the ny area bbq. But not as good as the Texas bbq I recently had...  not by far"}
{"text":"I am no BBQ aficionado, but I absolutely loved this place. We went on a really busy Saturday afternoon when the place was absolutely packed by only had to wait about 5-10 mins for a table.  Midwood is pretty huge and they're efficient with service so I don't think you'd ever have to wait too long (unless you had a massive group).  Service was excellent - our server kindly explained everything to us. We ended up sharing the taster BBQ plate and everything was phenomenal but it was ALOT of food. We are big eaters, but it totally defeated us. Most of the meat was spot on- I think the pulled pork was just a bit dry. The burnt ends were really delicious and so was the brisket.   Price was very reasonable and the decor is so fun and eclectic. The whole place has an awesome buzz about it.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Second time in town...and it was the first place we went to eat.  This time it was late night, we sat at the bar and the three of us enjoyed a sampler platter with Brisket, Ribs, pulled pork and pulled chicken...sides of fries and cole slaw.  Perfect for the three of us. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Friendly service and amazing food.  We had beef brisket, Mac and cheese, collard greens, BBQ baked beans, and a spicy Mary for dinner as well as banana pudding for dessert.  Everything was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The food is great. It's consistent comfort food and that's hard to find these days.  If this review was only for food it would get 5 stars. But, there's a service component to this and it was awful.  From getting to the hostess, to being taken to an occupied table and back to wait again, to the server boxing our food up before we were finished. It was a disaster. Rude, rushed, and unprofessional.  I understand the need to turn tables, but if you're scooping full plates off of the table to move people along, you're missing the point of service.   I'll call for takeout next time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love this place. All of the staff is extremely nice and the GM is a UK fan like us!! Unbelievable smoked meats, and great drinks. Reasonably priced plus a pretty cool bar and atmosphere. Definitely try out the baked beans and the ribs!! Make sure to ask for the habanero BBQ sauce if you like spicy sauces. Haven't had one thing we haven't loved. Highly recommend trying out a meal here."}
{"text":"We ordered a huge order from Midwood for a party.   It was all delicious.  The barbecue was tender, juicy, and tasty.  The side dishes were all outstanding.  The coleslaws were all outstanding.  Really is the best barbecue in Charlotte in my opinion.  I ate so much barbecue that it will be quite a while before I'll crave some."}
{"text":"read and seen many reviews and when a trip to see the brother in law in charlotte, it was a must try.  Bought, all in large plate option, 2x ribs, pulled pork, burnt ends and brisket.  Winner was the brisket by a landslide.  Moist tender flavorful and oh so delicious.  Burnt ends were a mixed bag of dry but flavorful and moist and flavorful.  Ribs were a little dry and tough but still good. then the pull pork, its ok, its pork strips with a vinegar dressing.  We had it as 'take out' so it wasn't all their fault.  The sides were smoked veggies (meh), sweet potato fries (crunchy and good even when cold), cream corn (good), bbq cole slaw (tasted like minces cabbage in watered down pull pork dressing), bbq beans (good and tasty), mac and cheese (good).  I would go here again but would try the famous one on Central Avenue.   i guess next time when we drive 700 miles again to see my bro in law.  by the way Charlotte, NC is beautiful."}
{"text":"Stopped here during an overnight stay in town on our way to atlanta. After almost a year up in New Jersey we were craving some real southern bbq. The place did the trick. Rib and chicken combo was great especially with the eastern Carolina bbq sauce(mustard based). Sides were ok. My sons brisket was off the charts though. Next time I come here that will definitely be the go item!!"}
{"text":"Great baked beans, ribs and Texas toast. If you are a dessert person, eat it first because you won't have room at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check this place out after hearing so much about it. And it always looks busy, so it must be good right? Right!  The place is very casual, but service with a smile and good BBQ!!! Better than Mac's Speed Shop, I thought. But, I'm not a BBQ snob... I just know good food :)  We tried the brisket tacos, sausage, chicken... sausage was YUM and a large is more than enough for 2 to share.  Sweet tea is VERY sweet, even with 1/2 and 1/2.  Overall, price, location and service was great.   Wear your baggy pants ;)"}
{"text":"My 4th visit for the usually wonderful pulled pork plate. My first dining inside experience. The music choices are good but volume is too loud. I was there for lunch on Thursday and it sounded like Friday Happy Hour.  And the fan speed blows almost any paper off the tables.  My pulled pork was too mushy for me. I know they can do better.   The staff does a very good job.   I will go back based on my earlier visits."}
{"text":"I have traveled the Carolinas in search of the best BBQ.  After stopping here, my search was over.  The smokiest flavor and no fat or gristle.  The sausage is incredible as are the small crinkle cut fries.  GREAT JOB MIDWOOD!!!!! I eagerly await you opening in Huntersville.  Its kind of bittersweet that you are replacing the former SMOKE Restaurant.  I knew that wouldnt last!"}
{"text":"What a great local resultant. Parking is a bit tricky, but otherwise everything else is spot on. Had the brisket and another night the rib and chicken combo. Both great. Service was on good as well. We do plan to return for sure."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars, but for some reason I am only allowed to pick between 4 and 5.  The reason for the slight deduction is slight and rather meaningless.  While I like Midwood, this place is kind of on a busy street, so the scenery around it is just okay.  So if you are considering this place, you should know that my only issue is more of a non-issue.  Especially since the grounds and environment of the actual restaurant is fantastic.  There is both inside and outside seating.  As long as it's not too hot and dont mind a little sun on the face, outside is great.  Inside, literally, the first step you take in the place you are hit with the wonderful smells of delicious BBQ.  The food is wonderful, regardless of what kind of BBQ you like.  Fresh, juicy, lean, and just full of taste!  They have a great beer and drink selection (who doesnt like a 24oz PBR or a nice Jack Daniels-fueled drink??).  The decor is really great, I mean the men's room walls are full of sex symbols from the last 3 to 4 decades...and rumor has it the ladies room has the same style.  To me that is just a cool touch.  Great food, great atmosphere, and the staff are tremendously kind and attentative.  Go here, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST BBQ IN CHARLOTTE.. I love this place and everything about it. can't go wrong with anything on the menu  Bubba"}
{"text":"There are few times in life that a meal is so wonderfully crafted and inspired that it leaves you savoring each bite and longing to return.  This meal did neither.   As there really was not anything wonderfully crafted or inspired about the meal.   It did not leave me anticipating my next trip back.   Maybe it was a bad day, but the food was just average at best."}
{"text":"Only waited 10 minutes for table but food took a minute to come out. They were pretty busy. BUT I must say the food was great. I forgot the name of what we ordered. We had a platter were you can pick 4 meats, 2 side and mush puppies. We had Beef Brisket, Pulled Chicken, Pulled Pork and Ribs. All the meat was moist, fulfilling and delicious!! Try the collard green and mac n cheese. Man oh man the collard greens was so freaking GOOD! Mac n cheese were ok. My husband enjoyed the ribs, he ordered some to go lol."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have changed a thing here. We had the combo and couldn't finish it! The brisket was moist, the sausage was homemade, and the hushpuppies had a great flavor! Also had sweet potato fries and bacon wrapped jalapeños. If there was anything less than perfect it was the pulled pork. Atmosphere is awesome and beer was cold."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on a bad day, but the food was alright.  I ordered the wings and it was alright and we ordered the brisket, but it was absolutely dry.  We had to buy the lean one (which might be why it was dry), but the fatty one was out.  Until next time!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ joint. I had the Carolina BBQ a chopped smoked pork with east Carolina BBQ sauce. I had never had the vinegar based BBQ sauce before but it was very good. The creamed corn was the best I have had. The bacon wrapped jalapeños were excellent, a tad warm but good. Finally the pecan cobbler. My expectation was great but the actual cobbler was mediocre. It was almost like a jelly inside and I wasn't a fan of it. Overall dinner was very good, service was good. Our waiter Tobias was very knowledgeable about everything on their menu, down to the alcohol content in the beers in tap."}
{"text":"Sometimes hard to get in because the food is fabulous.  Wait staff are sharp and fast and won't steer you wrong.  Pork BBQ is better than most in the area and the BBQ chicken is perfect.  Get the Midwood sauce if you need sauce."}
{"text":"I went today 5-31-18 and I had the 1930 Cheesesteak sandwich and fries. The service was great, not a long wait for my food. The food was great but I was disappointed in the size of the Cheesesteak.  I had saw a pic of it on Facebook and that what made me go here today. Make sure you ask for the bbq sauce that's what took the sandwich over the top. I even had the banana pudding and that was delicious also. The only bad thing about this visit was the size of the sandwich and the water. I ordered water and it tasted like it came out of a rusty pipe. (The water was tap water)"}
{"text":"Smoked chicken wings, Cuban sandwich, as good as it gets!  I could eat this everyday."}
{"text":"Again can't eave enough about how great this place is .... Great customer service on a busy Saturday night the owner stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed.... Food spectacular I will be spreading the word...Great BBQ has arrived in CLT......."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Midwood I just wasn't all that crazy about the food. It was good just not great. The menu was enticing and I'd like to come back and try a few other items.  I liked the atmosphere and the service was good - I snagged a picnic table outside and really enjoyed my dollar beers.   The queso was ok a little heavy but comes in a large portion and could feed quite a few people."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying southern BBQ. And it was AMAZING. I got burnt ends, Mac and cheese & hushpuppies. Everything was delightful. I also sampled everyone else's BBQ at my table and none of it was disappointing. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm just now reviewing Midwood Smokehouse. Having BBQ aplenty in Crown Town, you've got competing businesses who want that coveted, smoky place on your palate. I'm happy to say that Scibelli has done it yet again!  The locale on Central Ave is a bit tricky for parking. Pulling into the compact lot amongst other cars whizzing by on their way to Uptown can be a bit of a hassle, but it's all worth the struggle. Parking on the street is available, too. Be mindful of your space. Be sure you don't inhabit private spaces or any of the adjacent businesses lots as it my result in towing.   Venture in to the cozy dining room, patio or rooftop and treat yourself to the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. I can barely muster enough words to describe their culinary beauty. Smokey, cheesy, spicy, bacon-y glory. If you're sitting at a table amongst bacon lovers, more than one order will be required. They go fast.   If you're in the mood for a sandwich, the Superbird is wonderful. Smoked turkey, ham, bacon, avocado mayo, tomato on a texas toast. I'd get it again in a heartbeat.   The brisket is great. You can order a lean plate, if you're not wanting the fattier, yet more tasy, cut.   The sides are where it hits home. Creamed corn that is out of this world. Spot on mac n' cheese, greens like mama used to make and smoked veggies. You can even order 4 as a meal for $9!  Do yourself a favor and order hush puppies, too. Fantastic flavor and crunchy texture paired with their tangy BBQ sauce.   The service is splendid. Friendly, fast, and very knowledgeable of the menu. Great job to our server Ben!  Look forward to each visit. These guys are making a name for BBQ in Plaza! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Sorry but nah. Everything I had was mediocre at best. If this is the best Carolina BBQ I don't care to try anymore. The brisket was ok but nothing special. Definitely get the fatty as lean is a no. The pulled pork was very dry and not that flavorful. Had to put both sauces on it. Came cause of the banana pudding comments but unfortunately that as well was just off. It seemed like just whip cream with wafers. I was really looking forward to it. But I like there to be a consistency difference between the pudding and whip cream. I seriously thought it was just whip cream. Taste was ok. Just left disappointed from start to finish. The only thing that was somewhat good was the bacon wrapped jalapeños but it could use a seed or two to give it a bite. The bartender was very polite and attentive though."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best barbecue in Charlotte. Nothing more needs to be said about this place except for pure perfection. Awesome food, great prices, excellent beer selection. The staff is well-trained, extremely attentive, and friendly."}
{"text":"Food coma abound!  I did not eat in the restaurant as it was packed when I had visited. But I got the combo platter and tried all the smoked meats minus the chicken. I got collard greens and fries as the sides. I didn't touch the fries since I had been too full.  The sausage, ribs, and briskets were delicious. I liked the carolina pulled pork, but slightly more salty for my taste.  I would love to return and try other things on the menu, but alas....this NYCer gotta eat as much BBQs as possible during his short time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good traditional BBQ. Plenty of beers on tap. Outdoor patio that's covered and heated. When I was there the smoke alarm kept going off but hey it's a smoke house after all right?!?"}
{"text":"Stopped here based on reviews and I must say they exceeded my expectations! I'm a Midwestern BBQ guy and the brisket plate with smoked BBQ chicken is everything you could've asked for. I came on a Saturday night but used the pre check in system and that'll save you a wait. Luckily the wait wasn't too long for other people as well. If you're sceptical and looking to try something based on a review please stop buy, I know I'll frequent this spot as I'm new to the area. Good eats, friendly people, and a great environment."}
{"text":"Had a taste for some BBQ while visiting and was able walk in and get a table. The food was delicious. We ended up getting a platter to sample everything. W"}
{"text":"1. Too much salt 2. The pulled pork saw more smoke than a Cheech & Chong film. It left the food just tasting like burnt wood...and salt, of course.  3. Great service. Everyone was attentive and very friendly.   Go here to make friends with the staff but not to eat."}
{"text":"I took my Dad here today on his first visit to see me since I moved here! He wanted really good BBQ and I think this place definitely nailed it!   I got the chicken and ribs plate with fried and Cole slaw. It was perfect! The fries were as salty as I love them to be and the ribs and chicken were fall of the bone delicious!    We also started with the jalapeños wrapped in bacon, oh my gosh I would buy those every day if I could, highly recommend them!   The staff was also super friendly, while we did wait a little bit to be seated it wasn't much of a bother."}
{"text":"The meat was pretty good but the portions were small for how expensive it is and the sauces were only OK. I want to like this place but I simply haven't cared for any of their meats or sauces compared to other restaurants within an hour's drive. I can see myself coming back, but if I want real BBQ I'll have to make a drive I suppose"}
{"text":"Who has two thumbs and ate waaaaaaaaay too much barbeque?  This girl.  But that is because it was super delicious. You want ribs? They got 'em beef and pork, half and full racks. Pulled pork? Check. Half chicken? Check. Sausages? Check. Brisket? Technically not check tonight but its opening weekend, cut them some slack. And all of it comes with one (or more if you ask) of their 3 delicious sauces: the tomato-y Midwood house sauce, the vinegar based NC sauce or the mustard based SC sauce.  We split the BBQ Queso dip, which was out of this world. The smoked flavor of the meat went great with the ooey, gooey cheese. I got the small pulled pork plate which comes with NC sauce, one side, hushpuppies and pickled onions. The meat was great. I had to literally smoosh my napkin in my food to stop from picking once i was full. The collard greens I got as my side were cooked within an inch of their life, but thats not uncommon and I guess better than them being tough. They did have meat in them, but our server said they have a veggie friendly section of the menu in the works. The pickled onions were great to cut through the smoky meat flavor. As for the pups, I heartily recommend dipping them in some of the SC sauce.  They have a solid beer menu, on draft, in bottles and in cans.  All the better if you enjoy them outside at one of their picnic table or on the rooftop patio they are redoing.  Midwood Smokehouse is certainly a welcome addition to the Plaza Midwood restaurant scene (especially now that Rib Palace closed), not perfect but lip smacking none the less."}
{"text":"The food is good, actually very good.  And the service at this particular restaurant in this small chain was great from the hostess to the excellent waiter.  He even invited our table to join his family for chocolate cream pie on Christmas night.  The ribs were great.  The burnt ends were great. The sides were mediocre, however, luckily the portions were small and you only got one side (cole slaw, mediocre and mayonaisy, or undercooked tasteless fries).  In the south you got to do better,  two sides to say the least.  Better sides.  And rolls or Texas toast.  Overpriced compared to alternatives all over the Carolinas. I keep of wish I had taken the funny waiter up on his offer of chocolate cream pie.  Seemed more inviting than what the restaurant tried to entice me with."}
{"text":"Best brisket in charlotte. The bbq beans have chow chow in them. Pickled onions are the best as well as the hush puppies. Smoked salmon is great,  if you are into smoked fish.  Great sugar creek beer to drink with. Brisket is not as fatty as the pork. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food oustanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It Could be best in Charlotte. Briscuit to die for Atmosphere = perfect. Service = waiter had a serious listening problem and multiple things were wrong."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 5 star  for the one gentleman who had a very strange voice, caught me off guard from the hostess stand. Their customer service and hospitality skills were exceptional.  Food and atmosphere all were on que on cinco de mayo. First smokehouse experience and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Great food!! When busy parking is non-existent."}
{"text":"When you walk in to a Southern BBQ joint and see a review from Time Out New York, you know you're in for a treat. Be sure to get your soul food fix if you're in the Southern Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"We checked out this place on a recent visit to Charlotte, based on Yelp reviews, and were very happy that we did.  I had the burnt ends with Mac & Cheese and greens, my daughter also had the burnt ends with Mac & Cheese and her boyfriend had the Carolina Pork (that he'd been craving, as he is from NC).  The food was excellent, the wait staff was very helpful.  If I'm back in Charlotte anytime soon, I will be back here checking out other menu options."}
{"text":"Great prices! I got a whole chicken dinner which was $10. The service was great and the food was good. Wish they had more of a variety of BBQ sauces but other than that, it was great! Great portions & tried a rib which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. A carnivore's heaven and true southern BBQ jackpot not to be missed. It's places like this that make me certain I can never become a vegetarian. And I have no regrets.   Highlights:  Smoked wings (dry with sauces on the side) - they're sized like nuggets but are so tender and packed with flavors. Possibly one of the best tasting wings I've ever had - would come back just for these apps.   Pig Out platter - the bigger version of the combo platter that gives you 6oz each of 4 different proteins plus 2 sides. We had the mixed brisket (MUST GET), sausages (good but paled in comparison), ribs (delicious), and substituted our 4th protein with the burnt tips (YUM). Our favorites were definitely the briskets, which were incredibly flavored and so juicy and tender. I recommend getting the fatty ones (more marbling and tender). The baked beans were surprisingly tasty as well. Would've loved some sort of carbs to soak up all the sauces.   It doesn't look much, but the pig out platter is pure meat and enough to share among 3-4. Needless to say, we had more than half of it boxed to go.   Service was prompt and representative of southern hospitality. All in all a shack-less but amazing BBQ joint without pretense - a must stop.  Tip: Work out before coming if you're looking to make gains. It wasn't until near the end of the meal did I realize I had not consumed a single piece of greens throughout the meal. And I'm perfectly fine with that."}
{"text":"Large family party went there the evening after Thanksgiving. Food ******   Briscuit as good as I have ever had.  Burnt ends excellent. Ambience ***** Menu  ****** Service *   Numerours items not delivered properly, some items wrong, bill all screwed up.  Two very nice young people, but NO profesionalism and clearly a listening problem.  Otherwise the place and the food are as good as anyplace in Charlotte.  You really need to supervise better and check with guests to insure that standards are as required. We had out of town guests who could not believe that everything be so near perfect then the standards seemed to be set by MacDonalds!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was solid if not spectacular. I had the burnt ends, queso with brisket, fried pickles, and hush puppies. Cool building and location. Worth a visit definitely....as BBQs goodness is largely in the eye of the beholder."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I really wanted to like this place.... My husband and I met up with some friends last night for a bday party at this location. First we were told it was going to be a 25 minute wait which turned into almost an hour. When we sat down we Ordered the queso and brisket dip. After about 30 mins the dip was brought out and it was cold. We waited 30 mins for cold queso? And it Tasted like can cheese.... I told the server about the cold dip and he was very nonchalant and did not offer much of an apology. The food came out one hour after we sat down and the only thing that was hot were the sides. The bbq which they specialize in was not even luke warm. I sent the plate back after informing the manager and she brought back the same plate that she went and microwaved for 30 seconds. There were 8 of us and we were very disappointed with the food... We will never come back to this restaurant... My husband's burger was pretty good but that was the only plus"}
{"text":"Last night I had made up my mind to try one of the 3 tacos. Frank Scibelli owns both Paco's and MW so tacos at MW have to be as good right?  Oh my goodness, YES!  It was a surprise to walk in thinking it was pork burnt ends night (it's Wednesday) to learn TUESDAY is Chef featured TACO night!  Fate! The tacos were deliciousness!  I couldn't finish them. Joe our server rocked too."}
{"text":"Great Great food!!!! Had the 1/2 rack of ribs.. Meat just fell of the bone... I recommend this spot to everyone."}
{"text":"I came here once on a recommendation. Was told they had some of THE best bbq in town. I felt the mac and chz was lacking, the flavors were just not there. The bbq was bland...eh i am just not a fan. I will go to Macs any day before I go here."}
{"text":"If visiting Charlotte, it's a for sure place to eat. Awesome food!! Great service!!! Definitely try the jalapeño appetizer (not to spicy). The ribs with the red sauce and the baked beans were amazing!! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I love BBQ and if I can get quality BBQ, at an affordable price and that too quickly, then dang, I'm sold. Midwood Smokehouse checks all those boxes and more. Super friendly staff, great portion sizes, flavorful sauces and tender pork - winner. Loved this place and hope to be going back soon next time I'm in CLT. All I can leave you with is that the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich is my go to and you really can't go wrong getting it your first time there."}
{"text":"Quality meat and good BBG.  The food and service are good but I still have not found that one BBG place that just makes you want to eat some great pork BBG and a few cold beers every day; and possibly for every meal. Don't knock a cold beer in the morning until you have been there."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Charlotte I have been searching for amazing brisket and hadn't found it until I went to Smokehouse! I ordered the brisket plate and got sweet cream corn and baked beans as my sides. Being that I have been consistently disappointed with the brisket around here I didn't keep my expectations high when ordering but when I say I think I went to heaven within the first few bites, I am not exaggerating. It was AMAZING! It was so juicy and just fell apart. The flavor was on point and they do give you yummy dipping sauce, but I didn't even use it because the brisket was so good it didn't need it. I wish I could have had just a plate plied high with brisket upon brisket. The sides were just as good and did not disappoint. I am so happy I found this place as this will be my go to spot for now and always.  The service was just as good as the food and you can tell that Smokehouse must have a good rapport because it was packed early on a Wednesday night. The owners or managers, not sure which, come by often making sure your dinning experience is going well, which I always appreciate and find very professional and caring. The place itself has a good vibe with a mix of different kinds of people and ages.   I will most definitely be back often and can't wait to try everything on the menu! But most likely I will always incorporate brisket into my meal any way I can! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Midwood Smokehouse. For an appetizer we tried the pimento cheese fries with pulled pork. The pulled pork was delicious as well as the pimento cheese. I had the grilled cheese sandwich with brisket and creamed corn. Both were really good and I enjoy trying a different side like cream corn. I didn't like their vinegar sauce but their regular barbecue sauce is good. I tried my husband's pickled onions and baked beans both were good."}
{"text":"I moved from Texas, so I was on the search for brisket, because apparently beef bbq is a rare quantity in Charlotte.  I took the advice of some reviews and grabbed some brisket to go after calling in an order.  A little on the salty side (though that may have been me) and before I drove away I had a piece out (no sauce, let's not be insulting to the meat) and man oh man delicious.  It definitely sated my cravings for brisket that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was great. The only negative I can think of was that my beer was a little bit warm. Great atmosphere, and I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"It's good but some reservations  on the Plus side: Awesome Greens and BBQ Beans, in fact all their sides seemed good; again maybe best beans I have ever eaten. Nice place - almost trendy inside, very unlike a normal BBQ joint Obviously fresh baked potato buns  on the Minus side: BBQ pork was average at best A bit expensive but I guess that pays for the nice accommodations the bun flavor was quite strong actually stronger than the BBQ pork flavor  Overall - good but wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Here we go...  Got a combo plate. Mixed brisket piece and it was sooooo good. The burnt ends were tasty and didn't feel dry as some others I've had felt. The chicken was nice and had the right amount of juiciness. The accompanying BBQ sauce had a good mix of tangy and a slight spice kick, but not burn your mouth levels. The ambience was nice and the wait wasn't bad, great service and quite accommodating.  The mac and cheese and greens were also stellar sides. This is a spot you cannot miss.  Got it? Good."}
{"text":"That yummy fatty brisket gets my vote every time. Customer service is good.  The greens and mac & cheese are a delicious compliment to the brisket.  Best brisket I have ever had."}
{"text":"I went with my brother on Christmas Eve close to the time they would close and that could have been the issue. All of the food was cold!  While I enjoyed the couple of bites that were lukewarm I will either try another location or not go close to closing time.  The smoked wings were blah at best.  For the entree we had a sampler plate with ribs, pulled chicken, brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork. My brother and I split the meal and ended up packing it up to go.  The pecan cobbler was tasty however just a pecan pie w less crust. I look forward to trying them again. The service was very pleasing. They were attentive at the bar area."}
{"text":"This is the BEST BBQ I've had since the BBQ I had in Lexington! The vinegar sauce is amazing! The pork platter, the brisket, everything is spot on. You can taste the smoke in the meat and its always so tender and juicy. The service is great too. Being a server, this place offers customer serviceman great food for a decent price. The decor is decent too. Old school. EAT HERE NOW! It's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"It breaks my heart that I had to come to N C all the way from California for this bbq the burnt end were fantastic and ribs were fall off the bone sausage, brisket, mac and cheese were all the best . I'm going home soon so I'm trying to eat here everyday. Truly the best. I wish they were open for breakfast as I have a am flight soon. Goodbye midwood till I return"}
{"text":"Burnt ends are amazing. The Fat Tire BBQ sauce tastes great and the greens and BBQ slaw are great pairings.  Big secret... Best time to go is Sunday afternoon. Very laid-back, great service, not crowded, football on the TV, beer is cold and food is hot! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've now been to Midwood Smokehouse three times, and the more I go, the more I like this place.  The first time I went here, it was during the middle of the week one day last summer, a little before noon.  I ordered the ribs and was not impressed.  They were full of smoky flavor, but they were tough and definitely NOT \"fall off the bone\".    The other two times I've had the chance to dine @ Midwood have been much more memorable and have both come within the past month.  In the two most recent times here, I ordered the half rack of the St. Louis style pork ribs ($13), the BBQ Pork Sandwich ($7.50), and the smoked wings ($8).  The ribs the second time around were much better and much more tender.  the BBQ pork sandwich, which I had Saturday, June 3rd, for lunch was nothing short of spectacular.  I asked for the slaw on the sandwich which added a nice, cool, crunchy texture.  The fries were above par as well.  On my most recent trip there, I ordered the wings as well.  The wings were awesome.  As a true wing lover and connoisseur, I have no hesitation in saying these are some of the tastiest, tender wings in Charlotte!  Every time I've been to Midwood the service has been great.  Every employee I've come in contact with while there, has been friendly, and polite.  I am not sure exactly where Midwood Smokehouse ranks in the pantheon of Charlotte BBQ establishments, but you have to put it somewhere in the top 5; behind Mac's, but waaay ahead of the likes of Old Hickory House.  Something tells me, this place is going to carve out a tradition of great BBQ and friendly service in the heart of the Plaza Midwood for years to come.  I am a growing fan of this spot and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to get the brisket, which is beef instead of pork.  So hard to find non-pork BBQ in Charlotte.  I really enjoyed it, though all I got was the brisket.  I didn't use any BBQ sauce so I can't comment on that either, but the brisket was nice and tender, had a good flavor to it."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! The food is to die for. Ribs and Brisket were fantastic. Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable. Our new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"2 Words:  No Brisket :(  They literally ran out if brisket when we ordered it.  A) That means it's awesome.  B) I need to get here earlier next time.  Starters we had fried Mac n cheese with salsa and smoked sausage.  It was the happy hour special.  We also had the bacon wrapped jalapeños (amazing).  For my entree I had a half rack of ribs and more Mac n cheese.  (See photos) p.s.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place! The staff is very engaging and friendly. The food is great. It's a different take on BBQ. Some things are so down-home good food that I don't know that it is country. Other things are a fusion of new and old.   The amount of beer they have is staggering! The bartender will do an excellent job of guiding you through the maze of wonderful ales and beers they have.  All in all this is a top notch restaurant."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a burger last night, so I tried the 10 dollar burger that had chopped pork on it and bacon. Trouble is that the burger was way, way over cooked. Very dry sandwhich. It's the worst meal I've had there. I will go back cause everything else I've had there has been great"}
{"text":"Moist brisket. Pulled pork. Both top notch. Homemade sauces. Hush puppies- 5 on the plate not too many not to few and Delish. Bacon wrapped jalapeños were a guilt inducing treat and the collards were as good as my dearly departed Mema's"}
{"text":"There is simply nothing that is NOT amazing about Midwood Smokehouse. You want the best pulled pork in Charlotte? You go to Midwood. Best bacon wrapped jalapeños I've ever had. The pimento cheese fries are outstanding. Prices are excellent ($8-$12). Melissa Swain is an angel behind the bar. Today I had the Roadhouse Burger but the ultimate is the brisket grilled cheese."}
{"text":"My family and I dine here pretty often. Great bbq selection. Price is great and the portion sizes are good. I've have never had a bad  experience. The best server is WALTER. He is extremely knowledgeable about each item on the menu, he explains the sauces so well. He is timely and swift. He is to  attentive to every detail. He is managerial material for sure."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and get really excited over the idea of some delicious meats served in a unique way, especially in a place like Charlotte, that's known for their BBQ.   After reading a few Yelp reviews I ended up at this place and I was not disappointed. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with great customer service and a lovely atmosphere.   We opted for the Well-Fed combo platter between two of us and it was more than enough food. We got the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sausage and sides of mac and collared greens. The brisket may have been the best I've ever had - literally unreal taste, melt in your mouth goodness. The ribs weren't far behind, as they were also delicious, smoky, with a dry rub and tasty without being greasy at all. The sausage and pulled pork however, were nothing to write home about. The mac and collared were top notch, but not the best I've ever had - the greens could have used more spice and the mac could have used a second cheese melted on top.   We also ordered two orders of texas toast, which came by the two slices, in huge portions for a dollar. Even though it was a ton of bread, with an already large meal, I'm not ashamed to say I ate it all - it was delicious and the kind of bread that does not make you regret the calories. We ended the meal with some sweet tea and key lime pie - which was good and served in an adorable way.   If you're looking for great BBQ in Charlotte look no further. I'd go back in a heartbeat, but this time just get the brisket and ribs."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and I'm not sure why I've never written a review. I was a die hard BBQ chicken sandwich fan. (With Mac 'n Cheese of course.) Then, on a whim I tried the Salmon Sammie. I've gone from a fan to an addict! At about 11:00 a.m. on Saturday I find myself craving my weekly fix! The salmon is always cooked perfectly w/ the right amount of seasoning and smoke and the tarter corn slaw puts it miles above any other salmon sandwich I've ever had. The combination of textures and flavors is fabulous! Plus, Melissa always greets us w/ a smile at the bar and even remembers what we drink!"}
{"text":"One word: YUM.  Midwood Smokehouse has an atmosphere you'd expect from a smokehouse/steakhouse. It's casual, it's comfortable, it's pretty simple. There's a great bar, a large dining area, and every server we've ever had has been knowledgeable, helpful, attentive, and just the right amount of fun/playful.  Food, served on cute home-y dishes, is incredible. I alternate between the brisket and shredded BBQ. My husband will order nothing except for burnt ends because they're \"the best meat candy you could ever have.\" The sides are just as delicious. Bacon-wrapped jalapeños (a signature Midwood dish), mac-and-cheese, fries, and hushpuppies are a few of our favorites. The banana pudding is KILLER as well. I've truly never been disappointed with anything I've ever had at Midwood. The meal can get a little pricy for BBQ, mostly because we tend to not be able to decide and order a lotta food. But, it's totally worth it! Midwood is one of our Charlotte favorites!"}
{"text":"And this is why I am fat. For real. Pimento cheese fries topped with brisket? You have got to be kidding me.  Between the beer, fries, BBQ sampler and banana pudding (yes, dessert too) it didnt take long for me to start hating myself. The only redemption I had was that everything we ordered was shared- but still.  I really love pimento, its a little weird and I think you have to get used to it, but it was sooo good on the crinkle fries. The little char from the broil just made it better, and topping it with brisket put it way over the top to the gluttonous side. So obviously I liked it!  For our shared main we split the sampler, where we had a chance to try their smoked meats along with some sides. The smoked veggies were awesome- one of the more surprising flavors of what we ordered-and I would order double of those next time. I got the mac and cheese as our second side, but after those fries that was way too heavy and too much cheese. Out of the two, the fries win hands down.  Meat wise I preferred the pulled pork and the chicken, though everything was quite good! I've got a thing for banana pudding so if I see it I order it, and I am keeping a mental list of best ones around the country. This one comes in third place! Yum! (Magnolia's in NYC is still in first place, if you are curious).  Everything here was good, but not mindblowing. I was also a little underwhelmed by the service and the bar staff, they were not very attentive (no, it was not very busy). We also had to send two things back, one was incorrect and the other cold (the mac, which made it a bit gloppy and unappealing the first time around). Overall quite good, but not a \"must go back asap\", for me."}
{"text":"While visiting family in the area for the Holidays , my cousin wanted me to try this place after both had seen it on the TV. We stopped in on a Saturday about 10:15pm  knowing they closed at 1100pm  I had the burnt ends with added sausage and started off with Bacon wrap jalapeno's.   Thought I'd loose my mind - AMAZING and the great service only added to the \" Hell yes I'll be back\" experience. BUT BUT BUT!!!!!  The very next night while my cousin was working, his wife and I made a return visit....................................It was like we went to a completely different place. This time, we did take out.  To start.............. Way to many things went wrong to list---  1) Cold. 2) Order wrong.  3) Portions seemed smaller VS night before.  4) BIG TIME ATTITUDE AND ARGUMENTATIVE DEFENSIVE POSITION FROM ROBERT.when i tried to explain. He made me feel as though I was trying to scam or just lying.  Robert even commented how angry I was - So I had to explain the difference between anger VS stern clear communication.  It was the interaction with Robert and a female staff that I initially interacted with-both was so \" That isn't possible.\" regarding my feedback.   When speaking to any owner/manager about my experience I try not to bring it up, but I trained in the culinary arts in LA and Italy; I know a little something about what I'm talking about.  Robert's attitude was less than warm and \"I'll  fix it by\" ..Didn't seem like an option for him. His comment to me was  \"What do you want me to do?\"  He was kind enough to take off the charge for a sandwich that had cheese on it WHEN IT WAS NO CHEESE request, the person eating it or suppose to eat it hates cheese.  I still have yet to see if that was done on my card.  Bottom line........... I hope the experience that Saturday night is the norm and Roberts accusative manner isn't.   I didn't come there for Robert.... But Robert is the reason I may not come back.  Take this as positive feedback, for that is the intent.   The food we got Sunday night was horrible - what should of happen was a total refund.  ( For me -- it wasn't about the money)"}
{"text":"I am just writing about this restaurant from the perspective of someone from Western New York, where we don't have too many barbecue places, let alone good ones like this.  I tried the Cheddar chicken bacon sandwich, and it was just pure deliciousness, despite the fact that I'm a stickler for crispy, lean bacon, which this particular sandwich did not provide. The same can be said for the jalapeño bacon cheddar bites, but I just worked around it.  The pulled pork tasted very good, the idea of chopping barbecue in North Carolina is an interesting concept.  The whole place looked like something you would find in maybe D.C or downtown Atlanta or someplace. It was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Wow what a neat place! Being a BBQ junkie, the first thing you notice before you even walk in is the wonderful aroma of BBQ. We came over the lunch hour so there was a small wait to eat inside but they could've seated us outside right away.   Per other Yelp reviews, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the Mac'n'cheese. They were insanely good. The Mac was super cheesy!! And that's how I like it. We also ordered an appetizer of the hush puppies. They were perfect.   My mom is a big fan of pecan pie and HAD to try the pecan cobbler, with vanilla ice cream of course. She said she'd give Midwood a 10 based on the cobbler alone.   A+ to the wait staff as well. Very friendly and always checking in. It's a shame we're not from around here to visit more often!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and everything others say is true.  Awesome BBQ, exceptional friendly service, and great selection of sauces and, oh yeah, draft beer specials and bourbons.  Can't see how you can go wrong here. Kudos.  2nd visit: Brisket is so delicious that it seems like a waste to change the flavor with sauce!  Order mixed brisket, it isn't fatty at all.  Don't care for the hush puppies, however; perhaps you can substitute something better."}
{"text":"I'm a Lexington girl myself and thought I'd never find good barbecue in Charlotte. I was able to try the pulled pork and burnt ends. I would definitely order the brisket over the pork but they were both good and the barbecue sauce wasn't that bad either. I prefered the glaze on the brisket better both their sauces. They have a good selection and the staff was super helpful in making good choices. Although some of the sides were a miss, I can't wait to go back because overall barbecue is all about the meat."}
{"text":"I could not finish my meal. SALT my goodness, the salt content was absurd. Collard greens were so salty they were horrible. Ribs, salt, the only thing that I had that wasn't salty was cole slaw and water. Never again"}
{"text":"After living in Charlotte for a while now, I have tried my share of BBQ. Midwood Smokehouse is the best I've tried. Last time I went, they had a special on South Carolina-style BBQ sandwiches. My favorite. It was delicious again. It gets crowded, so hope that you get there when it's slow. I've never had to wait, but I've seen it fill up. I'd still wait for this if you have your heart set on BBQ."}
{"text":"I love beef ribs and this place did not disappoint. They actually exceeded my expectations. The beef ribs were the MOST tender and flavorful beef ribs! The smoke ring was visible; everything was wonderful. The beef burnt ends, mac-n-cheese, sweet potato fries...The staff was friendly and we were seated rather quick. I'd gladly make this a stop while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"WORST BBQ/DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!! Ordered the bbq, was absolutely horrible. I could not even eat it. I tried my wife's food, also nasty. This place is so overrated and just plain SUCKS. Their macaroni was acceptable, but the bbq was purely unpleasant. Very soggy, oily and just a bad taste with nasty sauces. I have had way better bbq at Shane's Rib Shack, Sonny's and the Golden Corral. Midwood is thriving on the herd mentality of people for now. Those who assume that they must have good food if they are busy. There are too many options that are far better. I took my food home, reheated it and tried it with Sweet Baby Ray's. Still was plum nasty. Hopeless. I didn't even want to complain because I was done with that place."}
{"text":"I had my first Midwood lunch experience today. Service was a bit slow and the place was jam-packed. The food was just as good as it is at dinner, my only real complaint is that there were too few servers and there isn't a lunch menu.   I'll definitely be back, but Midwood is strictly a dinner place for me from now on."}
{"text":"Thanks to Charlotte Mag naming this the \"Best BBQ\" in town, this was my first stop once I moved down to Charlotte, and I was not disappointed.   The atmosphere is a bit more modern than some of the other BBQ spots I checked out in eastern NC, but the food was just as good.  For starters, we ordered the cheese fries topped with bits of brisket burnt ends, and those are currently the best appetizer I've tried anywhere in the country. I ate so many I wasn't sure I was going to be able to tackle my main course.  I ordered a full rack of ribs with beans & fries for a side. Since I had already sampled the Eastern NC style vinegar sauce, I went with the SC mustard based sauce, and I absolutely LOVED it! My friends weren't huge fans, but this is my Yelp review, not theirs.   The rack was MASSIVE, and not too tender, which made it great for dunking in the mustard sauce. My buddy also ordered a rack, but with the house special BBQ sauce, which was also really good. The portion sizes were exactly what I expected, and the sweet tea was extra sweet.  For dessert, I took home a pecan cobble and absolutely fell in love. I haven't been able to stop eating pecan pies & cobblers since!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, I'm writing the review at the table. In a word: Legit. The table had burnt ends, jal poppers, Mac and cheese (zomg!), the St. Louis ribs special of the night. It was all amazing.   With food this good, the service hardly matters, but it's worth saying the staff is so friendly you won't want to leave. Our server was so nice, we wanted to buy him a present. (New baby on the way.)  We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Love their wings. Definitely try a bourbon flight with their pimento cheese fries. The staff is always friendly and well mannered."}
{"text":"Hearing how great this place was on yelp and the people who ate here, I was disappointed about this BBQ place. Me and my boyfriend are huge fans of BBQ and have tasted multiple places to get. The wait time wasn't long so that was pretty great. However, it took then a whole hour to take our food out. I was so disappointed because we had to eat so fast. In addition, the food wasn't my favorite. I honestly think the food was ok but not the best I have eaten. The waiter was sweet and ended up giving us a free dessert because of the wait that ended up being the best thing of the night. I wouldn't recommend coming here. Tried:  Pulled pork Cream corn Hush puppies Short ribs Fries Banana pudding"}
{"text":"I got the Well Fed with double Carolina pork, ribs and brisket. All of it was super tender and delicious. Reasonably priced and awesome customer service. Shout out to our waiter Todd. Def come back here if back in NC."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese is amazing! Awesome service and everything is always fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another stop on my quest for amazing bbq since moving here and leaving my backyard and smoker behind.  I'm generally disappointed but Midwood was a pleasant surprise.  Of the dozen or so places I've tried in and around Charlotte, Midwood is probably the best but the ribs are still just ok, no char, no amazing dry rub and sauces that are moderate when it comes to flavor.  The vibe of the restaurant is laid back, has a nice neighborhood feel, the menu has all the bqq joint classics and a few surprises as well.  The staff are courteous and efficient which probably helps since Midwood obviously deals with a great deal of volume.  If I have guests who want bbq I'll likely take them here but I still dream of finding an old dude in a shack with ribs that make me weep."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite spot for BBQ in Charlotte. So glad that there is now a second location in south Charlotte to choose from. We own a smoker and dabble, but when that is too much trouble, this is where we go!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for lunch on our last day in Charlotte, all based on the reviews here on yelp. They did not disappoint.  The meat doesn't need any sauce, but the different types all tasted so delicious we used them anyway. My daughter is vegetarian, and she even enjoyed her hearty grilled cheese with broccoli in it. AND dessert was phenomenal. We had the Pecan Cobbler with ice cream. It was large enough for 4 of us to share. I literally closed my eyes and hugged myself when I took a bite!  Service is great. Food is amazing. Music is nice. Atmosphere is fun.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Looked up somewhere to eat while visiting Charlotte and this place came up several times in my search. Very lively and fun atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. The food was AMAZING!!! We has the Pig Out Combo platter with the ribs, brisket, pulled chicken and sausage. No regrets on any of out decisions! The baked beans were also surprisingly delightful. The service was additionally fantastic! Our server, Melissa, was very helpful and definitely on top of her game, and everyone else who helped us was very sincere and friendly. I wish this place was closer to home because I would come back all the time, but I will definitely be recommending it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Their brisket is hands down the juiciest and most flavorful I have ever had!!  Their appetizers are on point (hello cheese fries) and I always leave there satisfied!!  Good beer specials usually as well - this is a great Charlotte spot."}
{"text":"YESSSSSSSS SIR'EEEEE!  This place is fantastic. Our server, Doc, was great. He gave some really good recommendations and was chill but attentive.   There is a great selection of local brews that we enjoyed. He tried the smoked chicken wings with the fat tire sauce and ranch (such good sauces!) and it was sooo good. Meat was so tender, juicy and flavorful. We were about to get the queso with the pulled pork because it sounded also delicious, but the waiter recommended this because it was more of a speciality.   I got the pulled pork sandwich so I could try some genuine Carolina BBQ, and the waiter suggested the creamed corn saying it was the best he's ever had. Well of course I had to try it! It was definitely delicious. I will say it is more on the liquidy side as opposed to being creamy per say, but I don't want to say \"watery\" because that implies a lack of flavor, which it definitely not the case.    My husband got the cheeseburger that had the pulled pork on it, and it was also very delicious. Some SERIOUSLY GOOD EATS!!   Plus they have corn hole to play outside, neat decor, and awesome murals in the back of the restaurant building!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Midwood a few times now because we've been in the area.  It should do well because of its location in Birkdale but I find the menu and food lacking.  The food has been hit or miss, one time everything was too overcooked, another time it was only lukewarm.  Service has always been good but there are other bbq restaurants that I enjoy more."}
{"text":"A trip to North Carolina is incomplete without a visit to Midwood Smokehouse! We ordered the combo platter to share, and it was super reasonably priced!! You get to choose 4 different types of meats with 2 sides. We ordered the St Louis ribs, burnt ends, pulled pork and beef brisket. For sides, we got the mac n cheese and the bacon wrapped jalapenos. I loved everything!! The St Louis ribs were my absolutely favorite! It was so tender, juicy, and perfectly flavored with a dash of sweetness and a lot of savory-ness. The burnt ends and beef brisket are also a must-try. If you want really good pulled pork, you should definitely check out Mac's Speedshop!! The pulled pork at Midwood was good but the one at Mac's is GOOOOOD."}
{"text":"Super local barbecue joint. Great selection of local beers and bourbon. Food was out of this world. I had the burnt ends which were awesome. My friends had the brisket and smoked sausage and all raved about their meals. Service was relaxed but attentive. We even got a tour of the smokers. Not a white linen place but it was friendly and relaxed place to hangout, enjoy great food and a beer/bourbon or two!"}
{"text":"We love the original Midwood location, so we were pumped when this location opened up. We finally made it in for dinner, and I was so pleasantly surprised that the new location was just as great as we were hoping for. My boyfriend always gets a dish called the \"Pig Out\" where you can select a variety of the barbeque and also get a few sides. I usually trust the creative genius and go with the special. Very rarely, I'll opt out of the special and go with a loaded grilled cheese sandwich. SOOOOO good.  A few tips: 1. If you're going in on a busy shift, try using the app called No Wait. It allows you to get in line without actually being at the restaurant and will wait for you. Our favorite restaurants use it, and it has saved us from the crowded and hungry waiting scenario that everyone dreads. 2. Get the mac and cheese, then dip it in the Carolina style sauce. One of the servers at the Midwood location recommended it to me once, and I've never looked back. The bacon wrapped jalapenos are also delicious. I respect Midwood for leaving the heat in the jalapeno. If you don't like spicy, opt for the creamed corn instead. 3. If you're on a diet, save up for a cheat day. The fatty brisket will make you so happy you did. If you never take a day off, however, you can get your brisket lean.  4. Get over there as fast as you can! It's so so good."}
{"text":"Midwood came highly suggested by our bartender at Birdsong, so we ventured here after a couple of beer flights!   I ordered the Dixie Chicken Salad, and holy moly was it a HUGE amount of food. It's crammed with greens, toppings, an avocado, pulled chicken that was a little dry, and delicious chipotle ranch dressing. The BF ordered burnt ends, which comes with complimentary pickled onions (white, not red, so they weren't my fave!) and hush puppies, as well as your choice of side! He choose bacon-wrapped jalapeños per our server's suggestion, and even though they were tasty, we were only served three small pieces and it left us wanting more. Banana pudding was decent, but I'm spoiled by my favorite in Chicago.   Overall, a total hot spot for Carolina BBQ. I'm not completely sold, but it was better than greasy food after a couple of flights."}
{"text":"A wide ranging menu from pulled meats, to \"burnt ends\" to ribs and chicken.  Overall, food was good and service was friendly and prompt; has a bit of a family feel to it from the vintage style dishes and the community atmosphere in the place.  Been here a few times and been pleased each time - the brisket is a favorite as it has the best flavor and texture; other cuts can be dry on occasion."}
{"text":"Every one of my friends loves Midwood Smokehouse. Full disclosure, their type of BBQ/BBQ sauce is not my favorite (vinegar based) Their mac and cheese is one of my favorites in Charlotte. I take everyone I know here, and most of then either order the brisket or the burnt ends. Personally, I think the chicken is one of the best values on the menu."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night. There wasn't a wait at all! There is also outside seating but they couldn't let us sit out there at that time. However, the outside seating looks like a place you could definitely bring your dog one day.   They have drink specials as well. They are:  Monday - $3 off signature drinks Tuesday - $3 NC drafts & $2 off cans over 12 oz Wednesday - 20 oz for the price of 16 oz Thursday - 1/2 price bottles of wine Friday - $2 off bourbon Flights  Sunday - $3 off bloody good choices   We ordered the Queso with chopped up brisket. The brisket was very tender but the cheese could use a little more flavor.                      We ordered a large plate which is more than enough food for two people! The Carolina Pork is what we ordered with a side of bacon wrapped jalapeño's and sweet potato fries. It comes with pickled onions and hush puppies which were excellent complements to the dish! This was such a great deal for only $13!   Overall the experience was delicious and had a homey vibe. *Side Note - bring a coat, it was chilly inside!"}
{"text":"This was my second, and likely last, visit to this restaurant.  On my first visit last year, I ordered a half-chicken.  It was burnt on the outside, fairly dry on the inside, and really did not have much taste.  Tonight I tried to get my standard order when I visit a barbecue restaurant:  a sliced bbq sandwich with hush puppies.  Much to my surprise, the restaurant does not serve sliced bbq.  Really?  This is NC, the self-proclaimed bbq capital of the South.  I realize that most folks prefer their bbq chopped.  That said, this is the first bbq restaurant that I have EVER been to in NC that didn't have sliced bbq as an option.  What a disappointment! So, I ordered the chopped chicken bbq plate, which came with one side and hush-puppies.  Just like my last visit, the chicken was dry and had very little flavor.  Even the SC version of mustard-bbq sauce that came with it could not save the chicken.  The five miniature-sized hush-puppies that came with the meal were bland and basically tasteless.  The only redeeming feature of the meal was the macaroni and cheese that I ordered as my side dish.  It was quite good.  Also of note was my server who provided excellent service.  But despite the server and the macaroni and cheese, I will pass this restaurant by the next time I am in South Charlotte and get a hankering for bbq."}
{"text":"We a had good experience at this popular Charlotte restaurant. After finding a parking space (a challenge in this area), we were seated quickly with a reservation--key on busy nights. Our waitress and servers were attentive and efficient. They were terrific with the two small children in our group. The space is incredibly loud. You may want to sit outside if you want a quieter experience.  One member of party received a drink not to her liking and the staff made not only one but two attempts to get it right. They succeed in satisfying her requirements. The two appetizers we shared, jalapeños wrapped in bacon and barbecue chicken wings, were amazing. The combo platter of ribs, pulled pork, and beef was good, but not outstanding. Though the ribs were tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed the crispy sweet potato fries and crunchy hush puppies. I'd return when I visiting the area again."}
{"text":"Mother of God the burnt ends are gooder then heck! The baked beans and mac and cheese?! Make ya wanna smack yo momma!"}
{"text":"Love those bacon wrapped jalapeños. Careful, there are some really hot ones in there! Thanks to our waiter for running out a glass of milk to me.  Burnt ends sound good in theory but I wish I would have stuck with the STL ribs. Mac & cheese was standard. There was mac. There was cheese.  Banana cream dessert was spot on.  Looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"First time having BBQ since I left Texas a few months ago and everything was delicious. The bacon wrapped jalapeños were a great start. Nice heat and flavor. My boyfriend and I shared the \"Pig Out\" combo. Ribs were delicious with the sauce on the side for an occasional dunk. Brisket was tender and flavorful. The smoked sausage with pickled onions and the mustard they brought with it was a nice combo. I even enjoyed their Carolina Pork. The sauce had a nice balance to it that I didn't experience when I lived in the state 10 years ago. Collard greens and Mac&Cheese were both winners. Don't pass up the chocolate chip bread pudding a la mode. Even the tea was nice, not over brewed and bitter like some places. Although we specifically went for the rooftop seating on a perfect night and it wasn't open and the downstairs patio was full our table inside was pleasant and the service was attentive. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic feast I had. I enjoyed my meal completely and the service was so friendly. I will surely be back for my tasty meals."}
{"text":"The chicken BBQ sandwich is awesome.  There is a lot of flavor to the chicken and the SC Mustard sauce are a perfect combination.  As a side I had French Fries which were nice a crispy."}
{"text":"Really fast service. We were seated quickly and our waiter was very attentive.  I had the beef brisket dinner and my friend had the burnt ends dinner. We got our food in about 10 minutes.  The beef was tender, the smoked veggies were amazing, and the hush puppies were just the way they should be. They had a Carolina BBQ sauce and their house sauce-- both were delicious."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ spot off of Central that has gotten lots of buzz, it's evident from the crowd and the reviews they're very popular but I didn't find the food to be more than average.  I had the pulled chicken with hush puppies, creamed corn and Texas toast.  The chicken comes with a mustard sauce that was really good and you can't go wrong with Texas toast but other than that there was nothing memorable about Midwood for me."}
{"text":"I am a NY native so I am not into BBQ as much as people in the South are, however I love this place.  One of the reasons being you don't have to get something that is covered in BBQ sauce, because even the salads are good.  If you are going to go here, definitely get the burnt tips..  and the prices are great too.  I came here with two other people and I believe our bill was only $35, even though we left stuffed.  The only downside is that this place gets packed so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"We just got our doors blown off fro this place - all the proteins are smoked to perfection. I think this place should be in some barbecue hall of fame!Try the combo and Pig Out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch and wasn't too impressed unfortunately. Ordered the brisket sandwich. I was disappointed in a few ways. The first was that it was chopped brisket. Would have definitely preferred it to have been sliced. Second was the blue cheese really overwhelmed the beef. The Mac n cheese wasn't bad, some bites were a little salty for some reason, but it didn't seem dried out and old or mushy like a lot of BBQ places do. It wasn't terrible, and service was good. I'd go back to try an actual BBQ plater when I have more time."}
{"text":"Food: Pulled pork, brisket, cheddar sausage, pork ribs, baked beans, smoked vegetables  Pros: Best ribs I've ever had, no contest. Incredible texture, excellent spice mix. Great sides, beans were great comfort food and the smoked vegetables tasted good. Pulled pork was good, but I wouldn't consider it exceptional.  Meh: Brisket cuts were too fatty, couldn't really taste the beef flavor. Sausage was alright, but nothing exceptional.   Cons: The sauces were not good. We were provided two sauces, presumably a spicy and a mild one. The mild sauce was alright, but too runny and the flavor was mediocre. The spicy sauce had little viscosity and wasn't really what you'd consider a sauce.  Overall: Get the ribs. The other meats you could likely pass on and not miss out too much. The sauces were pretty disappointing, but luckily the ribs are great without anything additional."}
{"text":"Not the way to start our experience here. Called from the parking lot right in front of the restaurant and asked if there was a wait. The gentleman said no not at all. Unload the kids and come in literally 2 minutes later and told it's a 15 minute wait. Nothing irritates me more than being told one thing but having another happen especially with kids in tow."}
{"text":"New to Charlotte & searching for good BBQ, natch! Been to Mac's a few times & really enjoyed it! Thought we'd check out Midwood Smokehouse just for variety, and we so wished we hadn't! Decided to go the take-out route, our first mistake. The call-in for the order went smoothly, or so we thought. Were told our order would take 20-30 minutes. Got there with a bit of time to spare. My husband continued to get updates on its progress....'it's coming,' they said, the kitchen is just a little backed up.'  In the end, an hour plus later & we're still waiting, they confess the order was never being worked on because the ticket was lost or mishandled somehow. Not certain where the drop in communication is, on the part of the kitchen or the order-taker, but there appeared to be much confusion. So after approx 1 1/2 hours, they really started to put together our order, and here we are waiting again. Finally, my husband starts walking to the car, take-out bag in hand, only to have some guy wildly running after him & calling out 'wait, we gave you the wrong bag!' All I can say is wow. How inept. We were so hoping our minds would be changed with some scrumptious BBQ! No such luck! The food was a huge letdown. Collard greens tasted like washed out grass, no flavor, just plain nasty. The chicken - well, let's just say, I make lots better. BBQ sauce, not our favorite. My husband thought the ribs were OK. I will admit the smoked veggies were pretty yummy. One small bright spot. After dropping $50, they offered to buy my husband a beer & our dogs some water. I believe we should have been comped this dinner, but that offer never came. Looks like the best revenge is simply throwing our business elsewhere. Mac's will continue to get our patronage. Just heard some good things said about Rock Store BBQ in Stallings. Both spots are supposed to have gotten the nod from The Travel Channel."}
{"text":"When we lived in Atlanta I was ob-SESSED with Fox Bros BBQ.  Those guys set the bar immeasurably high.  Now unfortunately at this point in my life I can no longer eat beef or pork without suffering for the following 24 hours.  That being said, I still love going to BBQ restaurants for everything else on the menu.  Midwood Smokehouse has me covered with their turkey plate, salmon sammie, grilled cheese, any of the side dishes...all so good!!  And to go with it they usually (always?) have a decent beer on special for $3/pint.  Midwood is quickly becoming my go-to BBQ in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As a North Carolina native and a lover for all things barbecue this place has to be my favorite in charlotte!  I am picky about my barbecue y'all but always willing to try somewhere new! This place did not disappoint!! First time I came I had the pulled pork platter with macaroni and cheese and the baked beans! It was perfect! Ya'll those beans are life, not some cheap stuff out of a can, it has pulled pork in it! Yes please. The barbecue didn't even need any sauce(though their selection of sauces were great!). Also, the plates come with a little bit of onions on the side...EAT THESE! I am not an onion girl, but these were made from a flavor God!  They have specials on certain days that might run out so be aware of that( we got the last dinosaur size rib one day and jumped for joy). Definitely a place a bring all my none NC family and friends when they come in town."}
{"text":"We are from Gastonia and actually love trying BBQ joint we haven't tried before.  I actually enlisted Yelp for us to pick our next one.  Midwood Smokehouse's reviews looked very interesting and promising so we went on a Monday for lunch since my husband was enjoying a long weekend.  The first thing that hits you is the smell of the meat smoking.  This is always a promising sign!  The waiter was very friendly and since I told him I was a newbie, he really tried to make our experience pleasurable.  We decided to just go for the entrée but I know I want to try the jalapenos wrapped in bacon as an appetizer next time!  We ordered the well-fed Pig.  You get to choose four meats and two sides.  We chose Chopped BBQ (you get 4 oz. so I asked if I could get double BBQ and count as two choices) and he said, yes, Beef brisket (1/2 lean and 1/2 fatty), and ribs (you get 4).  I found out with the Well fed pig you get 4 oz. of meat each and with the Pig Out (you get 6 oz. of each choice).  Our sides we chose were mac & cheese and coleslaw.    First, to comment on the meat,  I am an Eastern-style chopped bbq kind of girl.  I just loved it.  The meat is pulled, not minced, like I love!  Very smoky, it comes without sauce, has nice pink ring.  You have a choice of 4 different sauces, SC mustard style, vinegar Eastern style which I used, of course, spicy bbq tomato based, and their original.  I thought it was really good and ranks up there with some of the best bbq, I have had in a long time.  The ribs were good, and although I haven't had a lot of brisket in my day, it was very good.  I will definitely be getting some more of that next time!   For the sides, the mac & cheese, I thought was delicious.  I know everyone's experience is different and so are their taste. However, I have to disagree with one of the other comments that I have read. The writer thought it tasted like a cafeteria mac & cheese.  I really have to disagree.  I found out Midwood makes it homemade everyday and it was great!  Can't wait to have that again, for sure.  Now, for the coleslaw, it is mayo-based which is how I like mine.  It is very finely chopped and for me, it just isn't my preference but it was tasty.  I would probably order a different side next time but hey, the mac & cheese is definitely a keeper.  I will have to say, for me & my hubby, we are definitely going back and probably on the weekend, so we can experience a crowd.  They have a long bar some and some good local beer on tap. Oh, on Monday's 1/2 priced local NC drafts.  I got the Highland Gaelic Ale, yummy!  It went great with the bbq.  We would definitely recommend for people to try this place and hope you have a great experience like we did!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day, but I have seen others say good things about the burnt ends here............. I have to say, I didnt agree with them too much. Mine were kind of dry and lacked flavor. Sucks because I need to find a good burnt end place in the area (I am new here). Now, I will praise the wing appetizer that we ordered. That was the best thing my group ate. The other items were decent (mac & cheese, hush puppies, bacon wrapped jalapeno), but the crispy wings were the move for me.We also tried the ribs (pretty good) and the 1/2 chicken entree (also pretty good).   I will try another spot for my burnt ends craving, but the wings are awesome."}
{"text":"I had the Carolina Pork BBQ plate. The taste was bland and the BBQ sauce was just ok. The hushpuppies sucked. The bacon-wrapped jalapenos weren't bad. I don't understand all the high reviews. I've had better BBQ in Miami and that's sad.  Service was good and attentive, though."}
{"text":"I'm starting this review early because if you read some of my reviews I do things in advance. This time I needed a big order for my daughters first birthday party. I have a million things to do to ensure everything runs smoothly. I come here on Monday to ask about an order I need on Saturday (they require 24 hours notice). The manager said I can pay on Thursday if I want (I want to get that money out and have that order taken care of). She took down my name and that I need this by 12:30.   I'm not sure what sides I want so I place an order for several sides and the dude at the bar messed it up. My husband, baby and I are waiting.... Waiting... Waiting... I come to the bar to ask about my order. He's like \"I'm sorry I thought that was for the order you want to place for this weekend. I thought that's why you wanted the manager.\" Huuuu... When I went to the Take Out side I told the guy I need 2 things: I want to place an order to go (he took down the sides that I wanted) and that I needed to discuss an order for Saturday. Smh.  Anyway, fast forward to the day of the party. I'm having it at the Gymboree (read my review for that) and I had 30 minutes to set up, so I'm scrambling, trying to get everything in order before the guests show up. My Godmother and Godsister show up early to help out. I ask my Godmother to pick up the food as it's already paid for. She calls me after getting to the place at around 12:45 saying that it's not ready. Ummmmm... I told them I needed my order by 12:30. Why isn't it ready???!!! Perhaps they should have taken my number down to update me that my order would be a little late. Actually, wait... they told me they didn't have my order. And I'm like \"HUH???!!!\" Uuuuuuhhhh... I paid $300 for that food. THEY BETTER HAVE MY ORDER!!!\" She said they found (whatever they needed to find) and that they would have it out to my   Now to the food. Huuuu... Another disappointment. The mac and cheese was good when I ordered a side to go. But ordering this in bulk is clearly no bueno. Along with the chicken (which was dry as shit) and the tea. Everyone kept asking me if it was sweet tea. It was not sweet. It tasted like leftover tea from the bottom of a canister.   The only items that were good were the shredded pork (should have had 3 lbs of that), veggies and baked beans.   I made some rainbow fruit skewers and everyone tore that up! I mean literally those joints were gone in seconds. I got rave reviews about the skewers and the party in general but yea nada comments about the food. I feel like it was a waste. Should have ordered from Viva Chicken. I think I'm done with this place. The food is not good enough for me to order in bulk or even return for a sit down."}
{"text":"I have had barbecue from many restaurants but this by far has got to be one of the best barbecue I've had around the barbecue was nice and smoked the sides were nice and big I had the french fries and baked beans baked beans are really good had a green and red peppers and I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Love this place! Kick ass BBQ the way it's supposed to be!   Fried pickles awesome way to start. Thin sliced and not the chip version. Kudos! Main dinner. The all star is the brisket and ribs! Make sure to order the mixed version of brisket a little fat and some lean to balance the flavor. YUM! Ribs are fall off the bone good! I also had the pulled chicken and pulled pork both tasty and tender! Also along with the pick 4 are the sides you get to pick 2. Skip on the hush puppies as a side because you get some with this combo. I choose mac and cheese and the bacon jalapeños. Mac was thick and tasty and jalapeños....awesome. Bacon wrapped around a hot pepper! Genius! So dam good!  Also they give you three choices of sauce to join your meal. Try them all! There all good.  Killer food guys, killer. Friendly staff cool bbq joint, can't say enough good things about the place!"}
{"text":"I was in Carolina so I had to get some Carolina BBQ.  Midwood Smokehouse had some high ratings and a bunch of reviews so I had to try them.  When I came in the parking lot was full, a good sign of they must be good. They have a nice indoor and outdoor dining areas and a rooftop dining area with an awesome view. Overall it was OK.  I went with two small plates of BBQ just to sample a variety of the menu. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte#H2NatZtWVPmD9ZZyAuwwRQ  The first plate I'll call it the South Carolina plate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte#Sfxrntd0tSFhc9eIVqU-PA it was a plate of smoked pulled chicken, South Carolina mustard sauce, bacon wrapped jalapenos, and hush puppies.  The pulled chicken wasn't that bad for chicken pretty dry, the SC mustard sauce was tasty, and bacon wrapped jalapenos and hush puppies were MEH.  The second plate I'll call it the North Carolina plate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte#GtO6lixO30zEUv7twrDXPA it was a plate of smoked pulled pork, Eastern NC vinegar sauce, BBQ slaw, and hush puppies.  The pulled pork was good but not amazing, the NC vinegar sauce OK, the BBQ slaw not my favorite.  So which BBQ wins this matchup SC or NC BBQ? Hard to say I wasn't wowed by either but NC wins just because the pulled pork tasted better.  I don't think it was a good representation of what SC and NC BBQ was. Not recommending any of those plates. Maybe try something else their ribs, wings, and fries look good. Since I can't try them I have to keep it neutral 3 rating, BARELY, for their food.     They have a nice atmosphere, friendly service, and a full bar. The outdoor patio has ceiling fans perfect for when dining outside on warm days.  They have random decorations; one that stood out was the Hawaii license plate that started with a 'K'.  If it starts a 'K' it usually means Kauai but it seems like whenever see a Hawaii license plate hanging on the wall it starts with a 'K' now. There's a cool mural on the wall of the building behind of Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Wow!! We asked several locals if they recommended any decent bbq places and no one had anything to say, found this place on yelp and will make sure to be back. Ordered the pig out with ribs, brisket, pulled pork and sausage. The pulled pork and sausage were amazing and everything was spot on!! The pimento cheese fries are love at first bite....seriously....LOVE this spot!!"}
{"text":"Good portions. One of the best place for ribs in Charlotte. Good presentation. Fast and good service. Not too expensive"}
{"text":"The best food and the best service. The staff was super friendly. A MUST if you ever visit Charlotte. Ordered the nachos, with beef. The beef brisket and the bbq chicken. Sides were fries, roasted veggies, creamed corn and coleslaw....each and every item was fresh, and packed with flavor. The sauces with the meat were flavorful. Tried sweet iced tea for the first time, am addicted to the stuff now. I wanted to try the peach cobbler but they were out of it (emphasizing on the freshness of the food). Instead I ordered the banana pudding(if I'm not wrong, it was a banana dessert though.) Loved it.  I left this place, utterly satisfied."}
{"text":"Yum!  I had the delicious and creative tacos with brisket and pulled pork, while my husband split a massive platter with my dad (fortunately, I got to sample theirs too). The coleslaw was great with sweet hunks of fresh corn cut from the husk.  All was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always packed and for good reason. You know a restaurant is awesome when they have bacon wrapped jalapeños as a side. Midwood shares the title of best BBQ in Charlotte along with Mac's Speed shop, although I can't say one is better than the other because they both do different things really well. Midwood could get a 5 star rating with their baked beans alone. The beer selection is great and food is even better. Prices are extremely fair for the portion sizes. Their meats are all outstanding. Mac n cheese could use a little makeover, but overall it's not bad. Both locations are fantastic. If heart disease and obesity were not legitimate concerns, I'd eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Solid as ever; solid as the others.   Excellent BBQ with delicious sides (highly recommend the beans), topped off with consistently great service...you can't lose at any of the Midwood locations. I love that the experience is consistent across all 3, but the original location in Plaza Midwood holds a special place in my heart, so I'm a little biased.   Beer and drink selection is also great at very reasonable prices. This location is of course still family friendly and very casual. Overall, close to the same atmosphere has been achieves across all 3 locations.   If you are new to the area or need a fix for some excellent Southern BBQ, don't pass up Midwood. You will find that it quickly becomes a go-to spot for you."}
{"text":"Didn't take them long to grab 5 stars from me.  I sat at the bar and was served perfectly.  I ordered a 1/2 rack with sauce on the side.   Both bartenders brought samplers of different sauces which varied in heat and complexity.  Gotta say that habenero sauce was the kicker . . . so good.  The ribs were spot on:  tender, just a slight tug to separate from the bone,  flavorful, and juicy.  Ditto on the collards.  Me like a lot!  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"NC BBQ is one of my favorite foods and this place has the best BBQ in Charlotte by far. The smoked wings with dry rub are amazing and the bloody mary is a 10/10."}
{"text":"Really tasty bbq, friendly bartenders, and good drinks. Their house brand sauce is great!"}
{"text":"One of us had a taste for some BBQ, so on my monthly lunch trip with my lunch buddies, it was decided this was the place.   I'd really like to give this place 5 stars but something was lacking. Don't get me wrong; food, service, ambiance, and drinks were on point. Maybe it was the portion size or the ratio of meat to bread, or the skinny crinkled cut fries.  I had the Grilled Cheese with brisket with crinkled cut fries and Kentucky Slush Puppy.  Kentucky Slush Puppy was on point. Not too sweet, refreshing, and not a lot of alcohol. (Amaretto Sour is my favorite drink if that tells you anything)  The Grilled Cheese w/ Brisket was good. I guess my one problem is there was more bread than anything. Also I was expecting meat, cheese, and onions to be pouring out of my sandwich. I like a mess when it comes to BBQ... and leftovers. I mean this is the south... Bring on the large sandwich and overwhelmingly large portion of fries. Let me decide when enough is enough.   All in all... It was good. Perhaps, I made the mistake of comparing this place to BBQ's. ill give it another try."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've been to in charlotte. I kept seeing really high reviews and knew it had to be a stop for my weekend visit. I'm a HUGE Mac and Cheese fan (who isn't?) and it's the best I've had in my life. The grilled cheese with brisket is top notch! Great waiter and staff. The owner came by and talked to us & was a great guy. When I move her in July it will be a go-to. Thank you, Midwood Smokehouse!!"}
{"text":"When I see a new restaurant open, I usually like to wait a few months to let them work out the kinks before I give it a try.  But pork bbq makes me all weak in the knees, so after driving by a few times I decided I had to give in to see if it was worth drooling all over my steering wheel all week long.  Holy crap.  It SO was.  I went on a Friday with a few friends.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with baked beans, and we got an order of hush puppies for the table.  I opted for the vinegar sauce.  The pork was tender and smoky, the vinegar sauce was just a little spicy, and the baked beans had bacon (!)  in them.   The hush puppies were just the right kind of fried - crispy but not greasy, and were perfectly balanced between sweet and savory.   For dessert I had banana pudding that made me lick the bowl and my hubby had some kind of cookie/peanut-butter cup concoction that was also fabulous.  Oh, and the service was warm and friendly and we never had to wait on drink refills.  We had such a good time that we went back.  The next night.  This is a little embarrassing for me, admitting that I gorged myself on bbq two nights in a row and didn't regret it for a second (until Sunday morning).  But I think it speaks to the deliciousness of the food.  Also, the next night someone ordered the brown-sugared bacon as their side, and I feel I should warn you not to eat it, ever, because if you do you won't want to stop.  If they diced that stuff up and mixed it into some vanilla ice cream I would leave my husband for it.  I'm not even kidding.  I would leave my husband and declare brown-sugared bacon ice cream my one true love.  (Do you hear me, Smokehouse?)  Midwood needed a place like this, and I'm so happy to welcome it to the neighborhood.  Anybody have any plans for dinner?  I have this sudden craving for bbq."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since I love BBQ. Decor was nice, service was nice but the food was below average, I had the chopped BBQ plate which was dry and not much flavor. I am not in any hurry to rush back there."}
{"text":"The fiod was awesome. My first time going friendly staff good vibe. My and hubby went for date night. He had the chicken and ribs and I had burnt ends. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can you say heaven wrapped in bacon? How about slap yourself warm pecan cobbler topped with ice cream? The pulled pork was no slouch either. The portions are large, so be willing to share. Despite being busy, the service was fast and efficient.   Even getting there right when they open, there are several of us waiting!"}
{"text":"Stopped here based on yelp recommendations - it did not disappoint. We had the four meat sampler. Everything we tasted was excellent. The brisket and chicken stood out. The chopped pork was solid. The pork ribs were good, but I would not hesitate to choose something else next time.   Arguably the part of the meal was the pecan cobbler. Amazing.   Solid bbq joint, would not hesitate to drop by again when in town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Normally I only have positive things to say about Midwood. I usually order a brisket plate but this time ordered a brisket sandwich. What I got, instead of sliced brisket, was chopped brisket drowned in sauce. Smoke flavor is buried by the overdone sauce. Service was good but I would never order a sandwich there again."}
{"text":"On one visit (lunchtime) the ribs were like shoe leather - almost like jerky. I believe they were day old.  On the last visit (6 p.m. on a Thursday), we were informed that they ran out of ribs! Drinks are a joke - the oversized ice cube and 1 mouthful cocktail is getting old."}
{"text":"Everyone is saying it- and I agree- great BBQ! Whether it's sandwiches (their Cuban is bomb!) or a plate of meat; the selection, sauces and sides are delicious. You really can't make a bad choice. They are almost always busy but that doesn't seem to impact service or speed, so that's a big positive. We always bring guests here from out of town and while the ambiance of the one in Plaza Midwood is better, the burbs still love having their new location so close.   So why four stars instead of five? Seems silly, but they literally REFUSED to let me order from the kids menu. I'm not a big eater and was leaving town where leftovers would have been wasted, and the waitress told me no, it's against their policy. She \"asked\" the manager who also said no, something about the portions being the same size. I was with my husband and father in law, and if you serve children the size of portions they got, those are kids who probably don't order from the kids menu anyway."}
{"text":"Hands Down BEST BARBECUE in NORTH CAROLINA !! Definitely the best I've ever had . Amanda and her crew were awesome ! GREAT SERVICE !! Thank you from Naples, Florida :)"}
{"text":"Awesome burnt ends,  collards and baked beans.  Sweet tea was great and that dessert......wow."}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ places in CLT.  One of the few that actually have turkey and sausages, and don't rely on pulled pork with gallons of sauce.    Service has always been average, but the food is consistent."}
{"text":"Had high expectations and it sort of met it. It is a hipster place and food quality suffers because of that. Service was quick and friendly. I'd go back again if it wasn't so crowded."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was great and had a good amount of local draft beers on tap."}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow! I had family in town this weekend and my mom wanted real southern BBQ.  Found Midwood Smokehouse on yelp and so glad we went!  The good was delish!   I got the beef, my son had ribs, and my parents had a combo platter.  Everything we had was exceptional.  Our server Brian was fantastic!   He gave us recommendations on the food an"}
{"text":"Much of Charlotte is divided into 2 BBQ camps - you're either a Mac's fan or a Midwood fan. While Mac's is definitely delicious, I am undoubtedly in the Midwood camp. Their BBQ gives Charlotte a reason to be famous for BBQ! Start with the pimento cheese fries topped with beef brisket and thank me later. I am a huge fan of the Midwood Chopped salad topped with chopped pork. It is an incredibly satisfying, flavorful, enormous salad full of veggies, avocado, and deliciously flavorful BBQ. Their BBQ chicken is delicious, but you can't go wrong with the pork or brisket. Both are flavored and cooked perfectly every time. Their smoked veggies side is absolutely delicious and a great pairing with any of their BBQ dishes (especially if you're looking to add at least a bit more nutritional value to your meal). And, if you're up for dessert, their banana pudding is among the best I've ever tasted. The small size is plenty big, and the large size is truly LARGE. Definitely enough to share - or not, if you don't feel like sharing! They also have plenty of beer, wine, and cocktails available."}
{"text":"The Burnt Tips had me sold.  Everything was really good and seems like a fun little joint but the burnt tips were to die for."}
{"text":"great time and wonderful food make this place a great regular spot. be prepared though, it can be quite busy"}
{"text":"Giving this place two stars instead of one because I will give them the benefit of the doubt that I just got a bad dish. I got a plate of burnt ends with hush puppies and creamed corn. The burnt ends were burnt all right. They looked like lumps of coal on my plate and were nearly as inedible. They were rock hard and extremely dry and chewy. The hush puppies and creamed corn were nothing to get excited about either. I was looking forward to trying out this new Ballantyne location and they let me down :("}
{"text":"I am shocked this place has 4.5 stars, and forgive me if I just ate the wrong thing, but I am being generous with 3 starts.  I went to this spot expecting excellent southern barbecue, but was thoroughly disappointed. The reviews put the thought in my mind, but at the end of the day, it was just barbecue, nothing worth writing home about. It might be that my standards for barbecue are now sky high, but at least give me meat that isn't dry.   I try brisket anywhere south of the Mason Dixon line now, and hope for the best, and that might be a mistake in specific cities, like Nashville, where ribs or another type of meat is prevalent and the 'best'. I wonder if that were the case for Midwood Smokehouse and Charlotte.   Well, the sides, the meat was all average. I was not impressed, and found the flavors to be lacking. The hushpuppies were fine, the mac and cheese was fine, etc.   Anyway, maybe another place on my next Charlotte trip to satiate me barbecue hunger!"}
{"text":"Ok. Not great. Ribs were not so meaty. Meal was warm not hot.  Great service. Wonderful service. Attentive manager."}
{"text":"Very good burnt ends. It's a little trendy yes and it is a bit pricey but the food is worth it. Try going on a weekday as the weekends can be a bit chaotic."}
{"text":"BBQ joints come in all sorts of technicolor glory, from the creaky houses of yore, where you leave smelling like you're wearing SIde of Beef cologne with a sprinkle of sauce for good measure, to the newer, more refined varieties, each with their own specialty, from which they dare not stray.   These are not issues for Midwood Smokehouse, which does a variety of items on it's menu very, very well (thankyouverymuch), and they're delighted if you'd like another, come to mention it. And more of the good stuff is the attitude you'd best enter with in this wonderland of juicy cuts. At this sitting, I swooped in after the South Carolina mustard sauce with some brown sugar bacon (natch) on the back end. And if you're after some stand-up brisket, these guys do that pretty well too.   They brought some slabs out that would stand up to the stoutest Texan brought up on beef BBQ. In all, they do a brisk biz here and I though I was a shade concerned by the corner strip center space, I needn't be. These guys had all the bases covered (except, oddly, for root beer, which may not mean much to locals but is sometimes a staple of BBQ joints I've hit. The waitress responded to its suggestion like it was a pleasant surprise).   In the end, there was so much good stuff going down here that I couldn't tackle all of it. But these are the fun challenges you best savor again and again, like I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"My companion says it's the best BBQ she has had.  The sauces comes warm.  That little touch makes a bid difference.  Amazing bread pudding.  No pic as we devour it."}
{"text":"Great bbq, brisket, and chicken wings, but the sides were underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've lived in NC my whole life and while this isn't your mom and pop BBQ joints I am so fond of from my childhood, Midwood is a perfect blend of authenticity and creativity. The \"secret\" is that the folks here really care. They sincerely want you to have a great time, serve you some amazing food, and have you leave with a smile.   On my most recent trip, my girlfriend took me to Midwood for my birthday. Although there was a line, they quickly seated us and we were greeted by our waiter Jimmy who was attentive and friendly. I always get the BBQ sampler with double dry ribs, smoked sausage, and fatty brisket. I had been hesitant to try the bacon wrapped jalapenos because I saw some complaints on Yelp. But on Jimmy's recommendation, we got an order and they were to die for! Really, really delicious.   Their meats are perfectly smoked, full of flavor, consistently moist, and always memorable. If you're looking for a great, fun, foodie place - look no further than Midwood Smokehouse!  P.S. Their hushpuppies are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal as far as BBQ. I usually get the brisket because it is so good. It is tender and moist with an excellent smoke ring and amazing flavor. The pork is also very good and the sides are excellent. Good mac n cheese and I love the jalapeno poppers. To add to this I have only had it as take out because it is close to my wife's work. I am going to try to eat at the restaurant soon and update my review. I can only imagine it is better at the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! Got the combo plate with ribs, chicken, brisket, and sausage with Mac and cheese and baked beans, along with the complimentary hush puppies. Everything was amazing and great prices."}
{"text":"Best  brisket east of Texas.   Have it wet with the habanero sauce and a side suasage sausage.  The burnt ends are hit or miss and the Cole slaw too finely chopped."}
{"text":"My waitress was so sweet and her laugh was adorable.  I felt like she really wanted to make our experience worth while.  Heart eyes for days for Cristie."}
{"text":"Looking for a new place to eat last Thursday, my team at work and I stumbled upon this new place on Central Avenue. First piece of advice: get there before Noon if you want to find a seat. This place is small and fills up quickly! Parking was a little tricky as well!  Second piece of advice: If there's a wait for a table, grab a bar stool and let Karen take care of you! If she makes cocktails half as good as she makes recommendations and serves food, then she's the best bartender in town! She was funny, accommodating and quick to help us make our choices from the very expansive menu of yummy southern barbeque menu items.  Enough about the atmosphere...let's talk food! We started with the queso. I think it's the first queso I've ever ordered with barbeque. You had your choice of beef or pork. We went with the beef. A great way to start the meal!   One of my friends got the Chicken Salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was so large, she took half home for a great dinner. My other friend got the beef brisket. She fancies herself a brisket expert and she gave this two greasy thumbs up! Her side of choice was the mac-n-cheese which she said tasted like a cheese dream!  Everything looked so good, I had to just close my eyes and point. I got the pork sandwich with a side of creamed corn. The corn was gone quickly because it was sweet and tasty with a bite of peppery that would slip up on you at the end of each bite. As I didn't want to make a total fool of myself by drinking the creamy goodness, my friend offered me one of her hushpuppies which I baptized in the creamed corn cup in the name of the Beef, and the Pork and the Chicken!   We got dessert to go and snuck into my office at 3 p.m. to delight in the Pecan Cobbler and Banana Pudding. The cobbler was yummy, a little like Derby Pie if you're familiar with that. I'm not that big of a fan of Banana Pudding, but this was probably the best I've ever eaten. A large dose of vanilla made this less on the banana side and more just yummy pudding, but I didn't complain and the three of us had enough dessert to taste test on two different occasions.   The only complaint I have about Midwood Smokehouse? That it's way too small and too far away from my house in South Charlotte! I hope they expand soon and in my direction!"}
{"text":"Really good place second time I eat BBQ in Charlotte and. By far the best I had in long time everything was really tasty and full of flavor ribs chicken. Pulled pork. And the sides. Super good. We really enjoy it. Here nice hostess and. Our waiter it was amazing explaining about he sauces. Really good. Food. And atmosphere  really good guys. You are the best BBQ place in town"}
{"text":"Just simply outstanding . Portions were huge and every smoked meat was better than the last on their sampler dinner ( forgot the name). I had a pretty far drive from downtown charlotte to find this place but was not disappointed. Beer was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Went again today. Had the Roadhouse Burger with smoked veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash, onions and peppers). Really good! I ate the whole thing and I'm petite. Of course, we had to get the smoked wings as well, which were delicious. For dessert, we had the peach pie. It was good but not what I expected of a peach pie. It was more of a deconstructed cobbler. Was good, will keep returning!"}
{"text":"I would never come to this location again. Don't get me wrong, the food was great; however, the hostess was completely inappropriate to my husband and I. We walked in for lunch one day with our baby and the hostess started to ask us all these questions about our child, which we were totally fine with. Then she proceeded to tell us 1. Our baby was way too young to be out in public, how dare we be out grabbing lunch 2. That we don't have him \"bundled up enough\" (it was 60 degrees) and 3. She even made an extremely rude comment about my husbands weight to him! We are new parents and we felt totally \"parent shamed\" by this complete stranger. This was in the span of 5 minutes where she sat us down and then wouldn't leave our table. She completely over stepped her boundaries. Her job was to simply take us to our table! The waiter was pretty great though probably trying to cover up her idiotic behavior. Horrible experience. We will never come back because of her extremely inappropriate behavior. Management- do yourself a favor and reprimand your hostess."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we normally love this place. The food is awesome and the service is generally good as well. We live in Chantilly and eat here often and have never had a bad experience until this week. That's why I'm not giving one star, which is what I feel like doing.   On Wednesday, my husband took our kids to eat. I was going to come from work to meet them. My husband texted me right after they got there that I might want to rethink meeting them because the server seemed very impaired (\"like she's doing drugs in the bathroom\" were his exact words) and didn't seem like she even heard his order. What followed next was just crazy. She came twice more to ask what they ordered, when she brought the drinks she had to open the kids' drinks at the table and look inside (I have TWO kids, two drinks only) to see which was the water and which was the milk, and when the food finally came out almost an hour later, 3 out of 4 orders were completely wrong. Another server came over and asked if everything was ok. My husband explained to him that everyone's food was wrong- like really wrong and that he had already put in his order 3 times. The other server got a manager who took the order again. The right food did finally come out. When the original server brought the check, we put our card in and she ran it and brought it back. My husband signed it, and then she came over AGAIN and said, \"I'll run this for you and be right back.\" My husband then said, \"you just ran it a minute ago, thanks\" and left.   Nothing comped off the check."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday night on the recommendation of a friend. The beef brisket (lean) was the best I've eaten anywhere - and I've eaten plenty in my day.   The ribs were a bit dry. The highly touted creamed corn didn't do it for me. I didn't like creamed corn before and I don't like it now, so no deduction for that.   Another friend of mine had the smoked sausage and raved about it. The big surprise for me was the appetizer of smoked chicken wings! Meaty and delightful - not fried or swimming in sauce.  Extra credit points for the men's room decor!"}
{"text":"(3.7/5) The brisket is a must. I don't care if you get it in a salad, between a grilled cheese, as a side, or on a plate like how I did. It's tender, delicious, and slow-cooked to perfection. I ordered the beef brisket plate (both lean and fatty) with hush puppies, pickled onions, and bacon-wrapped jalapenos as a side. Unfortunately, most of the accompaniments besides the pickled onions were mediocre, not amazing. Do not get the mac and cheese--my friend got it and I tasted it. It was grainy like dry finely grated cheese and not very saucy.   Service was great. He regularly checked up on us and had great energy. We didn't have a wait long for a large group dinner at 7pm on a weekday. Compared to Mac's Speed Shop, I definitely prefer Mac's for an overall dining experience (sides were better, servings were larger, wait was much longer too) but like I said, the brisket here definitely deserves a try."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place?!?!?!  Well here its; Brfisket Burnt ends with jalapenos wrapped in bacon as your side.  This is a game changer.  As originally frequenting Mac's and Queen City Q I thought i would give this place a shot.  My god thank god I did,  This bbq is my favorite in all of Charlotte.  The burnt ends are seriously out of control.  The ribs are great and so is the pulled pork queso.  Their draft selection is pretty decent offering a bunch of local and national options.  If you want to show your out of town friends BBQ bring them here"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the fuss is about this place... maybe I came on a bad day?  However I had heard this place was beyond amazing and when I left I really had no desire to ever go back. Well maybe I'll give it another try if only for the banana pudding which was REALLY good (almost like grandma made it but only almost lol).  The jalapeno poppers were not good. They had a weird texture, were soggy, and the bacon was not even close to being crispy. I was very disappointed!  The pulled pork was okay but I've had oh so much better in my life (anyone who has had Lexington BBQ can attest to that).  The macaroni and cheese reminded me of something you'd get in a cafeteria. Again I just wasn't impressed!!  Our waitress was nice but clueless. She just never seemed to have her act together, couldn't remember our orders (yes she wrote them down??) and asked us if we wanted to order desert before our dinner was even brought out. I'm sensing that some other reviewers may have had this same waitress lol.  All in all I have numerous friends who keep raving about this place so I'm going to try it one more time to see if maybe I just got them on a seriously off day. If it's still not good then I may need to question my friends taste levels haha  Oh one more thing, the beer selection was good in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food at a great price. We ordered the BBQ chicken and ribs, BBQ slaw, sweet potato fries , ice tea and some beers. Will def be back."}
{"text":"Service was spot on.  Came w/another couple & everything was scrumptious!  Fried pickles, hush puppies, mac & cheese, bbq platters w ribs - yummy :)"}
{"text":"It was delicious we tried the combo platter and got it up sized and it was enough to feed two people plus left over for carryout."}
{"text":"Wow this place is phenomenal. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately seated. Chose to sit outside bc the weather was beautiful out. We ordered the smoked chicken wings for an appetizer which were awesome. So tender and full of flavor. I got the Carolina pulled pork with Mac and cheese, bf got the combo platter with ribs, brisket and bbq. Everything was amazing and fresh. Bbq was some of the best I've ever had and the sauce they give you (on the side) was awesome too. I put it all over my food. Mac and cheese was great too! Service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I can see why people rate this place so high, it deserves all of the great reviews and lived up to its hype. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Though touted as a barbecue joint, Midwood Smokehouse in Plaza Midwood has a Chopped Salad that is the dream of this vegetarian; Avocado, tomatoes, corn, lettuce... oh my! I love the fact that I have an option of a yummy salad when my man is in the mood for some pulled pork and bacon wrapped jalapenos.   When a solid salad is on my mind, Midwood is the place I am calling (their pick up window is convenient and parking is never really an issue).   Bravo!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte! Best pulled pork I've ever tasted...try the banana pudding, awesome atmosphere, quick service and good people!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Waitress described the menu so well and told her honest opinion about the food. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The bbq itself is ok.  The 5 stars are for the Banana Pudding.  Pure heaven - I'd go out of my way to stop just to have the Banana Pudding.  The right mix of bananas, vanilla wafers & sweet!"}
{"text":"This was my first BBQ experience, so I'm not an expert but... it was sooo gooooddddddd. Maybe it's not as authentic as like, a shack in the woods or something but since I have no experience to compare it to, I just have to say, it was great.  Hot, tasty, reasonably priced, and a fun atmosphere.  This is for the south Charlotte location. First, it was already super busy on a Saturday night and they let us book a reservation about 40 minutes before we got there. The table was waiting for us when we arrived. Our server was friendly, attentive, and happily answered 20 questions from a bbq newbie (me).  He brought us a bunch of extra sauces and always kept our drinks filled.  The (beef) burnt ends were amazing, and it seems like each entree is enough for two people.  Mac & cheese, the bomb.  The food came out fast, but not so fast that we couldn't finish our appetizer first. 100% will go again."}
{"text":"Great food definite must come back next time in town. Tried the pulled pork with Mac and cheese and smoked sausage.  The BBQ queso with beef brisket was great as well"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant, not much to say except they brought out our food very quickly, not to expensive and they did not have any areas of problem for me."}
{"text":"It's hard to give this Charlotte BBQ stalwart less than 5 stars based on their Burnt Ends alone. Perfectly moist with just the right amount of fat these tips are the Mecca if Burnt Ends! They recently changed the finishing sauce to a cola type which brings the sweet flavor to the smokey taste. I have to rate these BE as one of my all time favs! Also had the ribs which were smoked just right and had the competition quality pull from the bone along with the great taste. Do not miss these two meats when you go. We ordered 2 sides - Baked MAC n Cheese which literally melted in my mouth, along with collard greens. Both southern side staples.  If you like BBQ and are in Charlotte Midwood Smokehouse is a must stop!  FYI - parking is tight in all of Plaza Midwood so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on a weekday. Busy, but there was still ample seating available. Asked the server for her recommendations and was suggested to try the burnt ends or the beef brisket. Husband and I tried 1 of each. We got the large serving and it left us stuffed. Sides of collard greens, Mac and cheese, hush puppies were all delicious with flavors that held their own along side the smoked meats. Last note on the service. Not only was our server on top of keeping our drinks filled but every server and manager who passed us were scanning the tables to take away plates or fill up drinks. Team work has the place running smoothly during an otherwise busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Charlotte and I was starving - it was 3 PM and I hadn't ate anything the entire day due to an early flight at 6 AM. I was looking for food that represented the South - BBQ or Southern. I was choosing between a Southern restaurant and Midwood BBQ and I chose Midwood. And I am so glad I made that decision - you step inside and the delicious aroma of BBQ makes your mouth water. We were immediately seated and served and we started off the meal with some hushpuppies, and oh my- I don't know what hushpuppies are but they are delectable!!! For my entree I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Let's just say my plate was licked clean - the meat was extremely tender and the BBQ sauce was perfect and the mac and cheese was creamy and not too heavy. We finished off the perfect meal with a perfect dessert - the pecan cobbler! It wasn't quite a religious experience, but it made me like pecans even though I usually don't! Let's just say we licked that plate clean too!   Overall the service was fast and the servers were very friendly and the food was unbelievable! I would recommend everybody and anybody to go here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and food was excellent. Service was a B+. Parking was a little tough but not a problem walking off all that food. We will return for dinner."}
{"text":"Midwood has great food. The BBQ is the best in Charlotte, fried pickles are amazing and the sides are outstanding. They have some great salads also if you're trying to be healthy. The service is always warm and friendly. Overall it's a great place."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Charlotte! I like the brisket! Also the bacan wrapped with jelepeno side is the must to try."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was great! Customer service was on point and timely and everyone enjoyed their food. I had the smoked salmon (medium) and it was DELICIOUS and cooked perfectly. My friend had a salad so big it looked like he barely put a dent in it ha! Ask for the other bbq sauces they have. Will like to go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. Everything we tried was delicious. The burnt tip, ribs, brisket, fried pickles quest dip was excellent. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good BBQ place."}
{"text":"5 Stars for their Brisket and in comparison to all other BBQ joints in Charlotte (keeping it in perspective)  Having traveled and lived in so many places across our great country, I've had the forture (or misfortune, depending on the experience) of trying a lot of different types of BBQ....from Texas, to St. Louis, to Georgia, Mississippi, Memphis, Kansas City, and now the Carolinas. All are delicious yet all have differences as well.   I would say Midwood Smokehouse if BY FAR the BEST BBQ for quality in Charlotte. In my (humble) opinion, this to me isn't true Carolina BBQ.....when you try the Brisket, it reeks of TEXAS-style BBQ. BUT my friends, THAT is why is so darned good! That Brisket is some of the best I've had outside of Texas, and trust me, when it comes to Beef BBQ, Texas is KING! I'm pretty sure the owners will tell you that they tried to emulate a Texas style for flavor and texture. I've been here 4 times, and each time I always get at least one sampling of the Brisket, and each time it has been outrageously great! Perfect smoke, flavor, and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I just cannot find that anywhere else here in Charlotte.  IF you know of any place here in Charlotte that serves better BBQ Brisket, PLEASE let me know! The closest I've found is Saucemans on West Blvd. They're pretty darned good too, but not as good as Midwood Smokehouse.  I've also tried their sausage, pork and chicken, and I thought all of them were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Certainly no where as good as the Brisket.  I do love their jalapeno poppers too! Wrapped in BACON. Come on, how could you NOT like that?  I haven't been here in a few months but wanted to provide my perspective on this restaurant given that I've seen some really negative postings here recently. I mean it's cool that we all have our own tastes and experiences. God knows I've ripped a few here lately myself. But overall, in comparision to what we have here in Charlotte, I still believe this place to be THE BEST in town.  I wish we could do a Bobby Flay BBQ Throw Down here!"}
{"text":"Was here after Belly Dancing class Tuesday night. Who knew that belly dancing was such a work out? Famished and headed over Midwood Smokehouse. The place was pretty empty when were got there and it was late in the evening. Nice ambiance and atmosphere I would say. Feels like a bar with bar food. We were sitting by a bar.   Food review Sweet Fries- Yummy. Not greasy Brisket Sandwich- There was a small piece of bone, be careful chewing the meat. It was okay. Interesting mix with blue cheese. Have not acquired this combo taste yet- BBQ sauce with Blue Cheese. Mac and Cheese- Too salty for me Banana Pudding- Really good and tasty  Floor towards the bathroom was slippery. Bathroom was clean and pictures hung up like actors in black and white photos was it from the 70's, 80's or 90's?"}
{"text":"I had the brisket with collard greens. The brisket was so good and tender and juicy. The greens were delicious. I felt the portion of brisket given was small. They offer a small plate and large plate, but that's based on increasing the number of sides from one or two versus the increasing the portion of the meat. They offer a combo plate but you have to choose at least four proteins, and I can't eat that much."}
{"text":"Have been there several times now and food is consistently good. Especially like the brisket - it is hard to find really good moist brisket."}
{"text":"This is a Plaza Midwood institution now. I've been 100 times and never been disappointed. Brisket and smoked jalapeños are must orders. Also Rachel Welch is in the bathroom. Can't be topped in CLT."}
{"text":"The service & the food was Amazing!!! It was Tater Tuesday & Tito's Tuesday food & drink specials!!! We loved everything especially the staff!!!"}
{"text":"Im not certain which bbq joint people are reviewing here. I took my hubby her for fathers day dinner and we were sorely disappointed in the food. We ordered the chicken taco for my lil boy and didnt realize it was going to be smoked chicken which my the way is basically boiled chicken (not bbq smoked) the consistency was an issue. it was like one big piece of chicken and the worse part was it looked undercooked. So my lil boy wanted nothing to do with it. The ribs were overcooked and dry and salty.  We will def not be going back."}
{"text":"One of the best bbq places in Charlotte and will satisfy your meat cravings for a week. I could eat my weight in bacon wrapped jalapenos. There is usually a wait so come prepared. (added) or Use the NoWait app. It really helps know your place in line and set expectations if you get there early, super useful for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Am pretty pleased with this place.  They have beef brisket...hard to find in the land of pork.  The pork is also very good.  It is always crowded so avoid prime times for coming here.  And it is loud and busy.  If you have a senior with a walker or wheelchair they can accommodate, but it really gets in their way and to their credit the staff work around it.  I like their appetizers which include jalapenos stuffed with cheese and fried.  We had an order and they just were not cooked well.  Told the wait person and very quickly the manager came to deliver a fresh, perfectly made order to our table.  THAT is excellent customer service and satisfaction.  You can order mixed portions of meats and can also select fatty or lean brisket.  Or a mix of the two.    They really do aim to please.    97 year old Dad likes their mac & cheese and we found the staff more than willing to customize portions and selections for him rather than just stick to what the menu dictates.  Parking is also crowded, but somehow the lot outside does accommodate.  This is a good BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Over the last three years, I've been to Charlotte four times. Everyone raves about the BBQ, but until my most recent trip I'd never had the pleasure of trying it. Luckily for me, a local took me to Midwood Smokehouse last month.  We walked in the door and the smells from the kitchen told me we were in the right place. The smokey sweetness of BBQ made it hard to look at the menu because I really just wanted to eat.  I ended up getting a pulled pork sandwich and some sides. Good, tasty stuff. Friendly service. Prices were amazing compared to what I would've paid for back home. And, the atmosphere was low-key and nice.  Go back? Sure, next time I'm in Charlotte I wouldn't mind at all. I'll suggest it."}
{"text":"3 star is pushing it. Cole slaw is not good at all. To much onion. Just ok on the other food we tried. Was fast service for being full."}
{"text":"This place is a great neighborhood gem! There is an upstairs, outdoor patio where you can sip on drinks while you wait for your table...the view is amaze-balls! They have something for everyone on their menu, from burnt-end brisket to chicken bbq salads. So yummy and they have lots of local draughts and drink specials."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. Mac's no longer is on my list.  For BBQ and an atmosphere, come here.    First, the prices are better than Mac's, WAY better.  And you get just as much food.  Plus, the food was actually better in my opinion.    Being raised on the NC Coast, GOOD eastern bbq is hard to find if at all in CLT,  but they have it and it's great.  The service was great and the food is really good. We went on a busy Saturday night and our plates came out quickly. Mac & Cheese, Brisket and the Banana Pudding were the top-hitters for me that night."}
{"text":"This place is the tits. Ive only grabbed to-go a few times so far but every time its been stellar. BBQ is awesome, mac n' cheese awesome, hush puppies awesome, bacon wrapped jalapenos almost awesome. Everyone in Charlotte is obsessed with Mac's (for some reason,i dont understand at all). but seriously, for food,  Midwood Smokehouse wins it hands down."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service was so inconsistent.  We had a party of eight and the service started out fine.  Our waitress checked up on us periodically, but as soon as most of the food was delivered, she disappeared.  One person in our party did not get his food and it was 20 minutes before we could flag someone down (and that was not even our waitress; it was still another 10 minutes before we saw her).  You have a party of 8 and mandatory tipping is illegal now so you should be checking up on the table every few minutes, especially after the food is delivered.  The manager comped my friend's meal which was nice, but it was a bad experience overall.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos and the brisket were just okay.  I am not in much of a hurry to return especially considering the hassle of getting in and out of the place.  They also need some blinds or tinted plastic on the patio."}
{"text":"I had the burnt ends tossed with cheer wine sauce which was unbelievably good!  Very moist tender and the sauce was perfection. Also had bacon wrapped jalapeños, my #1 reason for going.  They put pickled onions on the side that are delicious.  Always a good choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a local famous. They serve good BBQ food and beer.   You should order a large plate if hungry because the regular size is more for sampling (about half the size of the large plate)"}
{"text":"First time here. Food is good but I didnt care for the pulled pork entree. It was really mushy and had way too much vinegar. It was definitely overcooked but still tasted good. However, I wouldnt order it again. It looked like the pork was put in a blender. Had this dish in other places and it was prepared much better. The sides, collards and fries, were good but the pork was just way overcooked. The service was good and the wait was only 10 minutes on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ in the heart of Plaza Midwood. This place will really be awesome when they open their top deck. I had the pulled pork which was very tasty. I liked their Midwood BBQ sauce. Next time I will try the ribs."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learComing from Kansas City, I KNOW what good BBQ is!  I was very impressed.  Nothing I tried was even mediocre in the slightest.  I highly recommend the ribs in Habanero BBQ sauce.  They don't even need extra sauce.  The brisket was amazing in its own right, particularly with the crust.  I completely enjoyed the beans, the corn and my God...  the sauces!!  The pork was decent and was exceptional with the variety of sauces to add on.  I would also say that the sausage is amazing.  Most of the reviews on here don't tout the sausage and I don't know why!  Dip it in their variety of mustards and you've got a real winner.  It was nice to have the hush puppies as an add on to dip with, etc.  Now, if this isn't enough to convince you, the people make it a spectacular experience indeed!  Both of my servers were absolute sweethearts and made me feel very welcome.  I would not have been surprised if I had been invited to go to a party afterwards.  Just incredibly warm people.  Richie Haddox the manager even stopped by several times to check on me and treated me to some great conversation as well as a little extra sauce.  ;-)  An awesome experience to be sure!  These people know good BBQ and exceptional customer service.  Its too easy to find average or even bad customer service these days.  Tragic commentary on where we've come to as a society.  Not at Midwood Smokehouse, however.  I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in town, and to my buds back home... get ready!  I'm bringing home some killer sauce!n about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Best BBQ around!  I'm so glad there is a new location in Huntersville, closer to where I live. Great place and staff was very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"I've probably been to most of the BBQ places around charlotte that are worth going to.  I would say this place is probably my favorite.  Came here with my family to get an assortment of BBQ choices.   I recommend getting the large platter to share if you want a variety of meat.  I am a brisket kind of guy, so I say this brisket comes up to par with some of the best in Charlotte.  Although its no Texas brisket, i would say this comes just right under Texas' brisket.  Nonetheless, this place is worth trying out.    The larger patter comes with 2 sides and your choice of 4 meats.  I would suggest just trying all they have to offer.  The BBQ pulled pork and sausage is great.  The brisket is amazingly tender and soft.    If you're looking for an appetizer as you wait, i would get the wings.  These wings are pretty decently made with a unique flavor of BBQ.  It isn't your typical type of bbq wings, but its something you must try.  All together i probably spent $60 to feed a party of 6.  We came out stuffed."}
{"text":"When my husband and I moved to Charlotte in April 2014, this was one of the first places that we visited. In the last year, it has quickly become one of our favorite spots! The food and service is consistently good and it is the best BBQ that we have found in the Charlotte area. Try the burnt ends and the mac 'n cheese!  The parking and wait can sometimes but an issue but I can assure you that it is worth the wait. They offer a service that will text you when your table is ready so you can go across the street for a drink while you're waiting. Also, getting there early is definitely recommended in order to get decent parking."}
{"text":"Very good food, only compliant is the restaurant size is pretty small. You at times will feel like you're on top of other people."}
{"text":"Great place! Brisket is my favorite. Also the queso brisket dip is the bomb and so is the hogapeno dip YUM!"}
{"text":"I may not be the biggest fan of barbecue, but Midwood was really something else. We came on a Sunday afternoon and sat out on the porch, thoroughly enjoying the laid back atmosphere and beautiful weather.  Our order included a Bloody Mary ($3 off that day), a Combo platter with the chopped pork, beef brisket, St. Louis ribs, and smoked sausage and sides of mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapeños. We also added a side of burnt ends. My favourite meat would have to be the beef brisket - it was the perfect balance of lean and fatty meat. Pair that with Midwood's signature bbq sauce and you're solid. The ribs were also very tender. Although the burnt ends were packed with flavour, the meat was a bit tough for me since it was fully cooked through.  Aside from enjoying all the meats, I thought the sides were alright. I would have preferred a runnier consistency for the mac and cheese, and I am just not too fond of bacon in general.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to rate this place higher, but I just couldn't do it. The food was good, not great. The server was better than good, I had expected slow service after reading other reviews, but our waitress was on the ball with water refills and taking our order.   We started with an order of hush puppies, which my Wife and Daughter enjoyed. My meal came with them, so I waited for those. Alex ordered a brisket sandwich, which was served stacked on a bun. She selected mac & cheese as her side. She loved the mac & cheese, and said that the brisket was OK, but not as good as I make. I think she was sucking up for something from her Daddy. Alina ordered the BBQ Chicken sandwich. She really enjoyed her choice, and had the yummy mac & cheese as well. I splurged, and order a large burnt ends plate, with sides of cole slaw and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers. Let's start with the sides. The cole slaw was chopped, and a tasty mixture of white and purple cabbage. It was a little dry for my taste, but it was still good. I loved the pepper poppers. They were the highlight of the meal. The bacon was cooked just right, not crispy and not undercooked to be chewy. The peppers had just the right amount of heat, and the cheese blended nicely with the 2 flavors. I loved them (in case you missed that the first time). Lastly, the burnt ends. I have prepared burnt ends a couple of times, and I think mine turned out better. My issue with these are that they seemed more like chinks of meat, rather than the actual ends of the brisket. They were tasty, but mostly from the sauce they were tossed in. I liked the smoky flavor in each bite, but the meat itself was nothing special.   So 3 stars? Mostly because of the price. Our bill was $42, with only 1 soft drink on the tab. For what we got, it was an expensive lunch, with no to go boxes."}
{"text":"The brisket was very good! For my appetizer I had jalapeños wrapped in bacon and they were also very tasty. Great service and overall a really good experience. If you like beer try the copper!"}
{"text":"I love barbeque so, I really tried to like this place and I live around the corner. The veggies are very good but, the pulled pork just doesn't do it for me. I gave it 4 tryouts and was not impressed."}
{"text":"Had a corporate dinner here, the Brisket was as good as I've ever has. The baked beans had meat in them and they were wonderful. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a meaningful review that hasn't covered every facet of this popular bbq haven. I've had their pulled pork, and most people agree that it's very good. It's hard to get the right balance of smokiness in bbq, too little and it tastes bland, too much and it's overpowering. It's mouthwatering when it's done right, and they certainly have the skills at Midwood. I expected the pulled pork to be great, but their tacos were a pleasant surprise. Why eat brisket, slaw, and mac n cheese separately when you can have a perfect fusion of flavor all in the same bite!  Their creamed corn is great too, they add just enough salt and pepper to keep it from being pedestrian. The bacon wrapped jalapenos are fine too, but I wish they served more of them.   I can only speak for myself, but every time I've ate at Midwood I went home happy with a full belly. Sometimes the wait for a table can be a little long on a busy night, and their service can be a little sluggish because of it. But they're always friendly, and the food is always great. And isn't that all that really matters?"}
{"text":"Texas hash is  all the food is amazing! Check to see if there is a wait before you go, if there is add yourself to the waitlist via Yelp - super clutch. Decor is awesome, beer selection is on point - all around 5 stars"}
{"text":"I loved the burnt ends! And the sweet tea is just right with my favorite crushed ice. Will definitely be returning. The only complaint was that the hostess wasn't very organized and began seating others that arrived after us while we still waited."}
{"text":"with a hangover and no desire to make that ridiculous trek from NoDa all the way over to southend for BBQ, my buddy Ty geniusly brought up Midwood Smokehouse.  i cannot remember what the place was before this, but that was the last time i was there.  we bellied up to the bar and the quite capable barkeep, Chad, proceeded to help us.  he had just gotten done writing the special on the mirror behind the bar, and it was just what we needed.  8 oz. of brisket over mashed potatoes with a side.  i had originally said that i was down for the creamed corn, but then changed my mind after seeing bacon wrapped jalepenos with cheese inside.  oh my.  the brisket was succulent with fantastic flavor.  the mashed potatoes weren't too bad, but nothing crazy.  might have been a tinge of garlic to them.  the bacon wrapped jalepenos were awesome.  everything my mouth wanted and stomach needed  after a night of drinking.  about halfway done with my meal, one of the other servers said he forgot my creamed corn and brought me a cup of it.  good consistency with a tinge of cheese to it, which was a good spin i thought.  my only possible complaint about the place would be that their ceilings are high and they put the televisions as much out of the way and as high as possible.  sitting at the bar, this means you are craning your neck to watch the games.  being a stone's throw from the beaver and having ample outdoor seating, there will be a return trip with fairer weather coming."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is situated right in the heart of the Plaza-Midwood area surrounded by tons of great places to eat and yet it rises above the rest.  No easy feat.  For one, I had heard stories about this place prior to visiting, about how the food was so good that it was always crowded and you might have to wait to be seated.  Well the first time I went came here with a friend we did in fact end up having to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but I have to say those 15 minutes were very well worth it.  First off, the staff is amazing.  Always friendly and conversational, knowledgable of the menu, and happy to be there.    The shining star meal of the Midwood Smokehouse for me is the Burnt Ends BBQ plate.  These are little cubes of meat made with their in house Fat Tire sauce.  I was really blown away at how great these things tasted the first time I had them.  I ordered a small plate and regretted not getting a large.  Seriously they're that good.  On the side I also decided to try their bacon wrapped jalapeño side as a jalapeño wrapped in bacon was an odd combination that I had never heard of.  These were really good too.  I'll recommend grabbing a side of them with whatever meal you decide to get.  Overall I must say the food at Midwood Smokehouse is top-notch.  Midwood Smokehouse has a sizable menu of draft beers so we decided to have a few.  A good portion of their selection consists of local drafts from right here in NC so I went for the Mother Earth IPA out of my hometown and it was as good as expected.  I can't recommend Midwood Smokehouse enough. It's well worth the wait to get in and I see what all the fuss was about over this place.  Since first trying them in 2013 I've been back several times and it's always a great eating experience.  BBQ is big in the part of NC that I'm from and I have to say Midwood Smokehouse ranks among some of the best in the state."}
{"text":"Great BBQ here. My first visit I got the Burnt Ends special which used a Cheerwine based BBQ sauce. It was amazing!!! The next visit I tried and loved the bacon wrapped Jalapeños and had a really good pulled pork sandwich. Brisket topped queso is good as well and love the hush puppies!!! I will be back here for sure many more times!"}
{"text":"We went after it had been open for about a month. As a reference the location in Plaza Midwood is my hands down favorite BBQ spot in Charlotte. I think this place is close but not the same. For some reason I thought flavor, moisture, etc of the pork BBQ and ribs were not the same as the original location.  Service was super efficient and friendly, I loved the beers on tap and drank many of them. The food was kind of just luke warm when we got it, but I definitely want to try again and see how they are doing now that they've been up and running for awhile. If they can replicate the entire Plaza Midwood location experience this close to my house I will have a belly full of BBQ way too often!"}
{"text":"This is a must try for the Barbecue lovers in Charlotte.. I lived in Charlotte for only a few months and I came here at the recommendation of a friend. Definitely am glad that I came here.  I remember coming here very late, must have been 10:00PM  - surprised that it was a full house. I got a pulled pork sandwich with macaroni and cheese and it was divine.  If you are a true barbecue lover or just in the mood for something new, you must come here! You certainly won't regret it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came in from Orlando for the night and yelped the best BBQ in Charlotte. This place did not disappoint. The carolina pork was phenomenal and the large plate was more then filing. All the sides were awesome. Between my girlfriend and i we had mac n cheese, jalapenos, baked beans, and the smoked veggied. All were awesome. They also have a great beer and cocktail selection!"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff incredible food and amazing customer service. I would encourage anyone to visit any Midwood location. I grew up in the Dilworth / Myers Park area and love that we have a location in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Got stranded in Charlotte for the night and had to try some BBQ, made the cab ride out to experience it. There is a wide selection of local beers, guest beers, and bottled beers. The food was delicious and the atmosphere laid back. Worth the journey!"}
{"text":"I've never had a chance before but after my gf got me take away I was surprised! Great Hamburger !!! I need to check this place ASAP"}
{"text":"Best BBQ and sides in Charlotte. Hush puppies, Mac n cheese, bake beans. I had the pulled pork my girl had a delicious brisket sandwich"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse may be the best barbecue I have had in the Southeast.  This includes any place in Memphis, Fox Brothers in Atlanta and Martin's in Nashville.  Fantastic sauces and sides.  The ribs were perfectly cooked and the burnt ends were great.  This restaurant is essential to a trip to Charlotte if you love barbecue."}
{"text":"The address is actually 540 Brandywine Road.    Great service, great food, great atmosphere. We sat in the round booth right in the center of all the energy.  Started with the smoked wings. Very tender and tasty. Main course was the hickory salmon with a pico salsa. Again very delicious.  Earlier in the week we had the pecan cobbler with ice cream.  Decedent and delicious.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Just tried this new (for me) place for dinner. Had a great time and the atmosphere was superb. My server was Cristie and she was a great help in deciding what would \"go\" with what! She helped me chose a great new beer that I hadn't tried before as well and it seemed to \"pair\" well with my BBQ. Thanks for such a good night!! Way to go Cristie!!"}
{"text":"Love midwood smokehouse! The drink specials are great, family friendly yet bar atmosphere works. Try the queso dip with pulled pork."}
{"text":"The delicious smells of BBQ when you walk in make your mouth water! The service was very friendly and attentive. The food was awesome!!"}
{"text":"First time having barbecue in North Carolina, and I loved it! I didn't have too much variety, but I do want to rave about what I ordered. I got the brisket plate, and boy was it delicious! My only regret is ordering a mix of lean and fatty, instead of just fatty brisket... the fatty stuff was far superior to the lean stuff! I loved that in every bite, I was getting all this delicious fat mixed in with the meat! The hushpuppies were pretty good, I'm always a fan of pickled onions, and the no frills coleslaw was really good!  If I'm ever back, I'll definitely try the other bbq, but at 10$ for my brisket plate, I'd always be OK ordering that"}
{"text":"Just the mention of Midwood makes me JIZZ in my pants. I always have the brisket with mac and cheese and it's godlike. I could smell my dessert (apple crisp) coming and at that moment knew I no longer needed a girlfriend...for i have MIDWOOD."}
{"text":"Been open for about 5 weeks now and they area going to do well. Very Good BBQ  We originally tried to visit for lunch yesterday but someone had cut the power to part of Birkdale so they were not open when we were there.  Went back today after Church and got there just before they opened. Walked in and was immediately seated  I've dined at the original location on Central Ave in Plaza Midwood and have always enjoyed my meals here..  Was curious if the had been able to recreate that experience and in terms of cuisine the answer is a definite yes.. The Central Ave location has more of a homey feel to it while this restaurant is in what used to be Modern Smoke and the Neo-Industrial. Design is still present. In other words, very very modern with plenty of stainless, dark wood and glass.  Our server was great.  He was at out table almost from the time we sat down and continued to check in to make sure we were well taken care of  I ordered the Carolina Pork which is supposedly an Eastern Style with Pepper Vinegar but you have to add your own Pepper Vinegar at the table. The Pepper Vinegar they serve is a bit tame with not a lot of heat or acidity. Hush Puppies were very  good but they do have a bit too much sugar in the batter.  Fries which I chose for my side were very good but I'm tempted to try another of my favorites, the BBQ Slaw next time.  My wife ordered a built it yourself Salad where you start with Seven Components, add a meat, a crunch and your favorite dressing.  Very good. She chose the Brisket  for the meat. Only disappointment was one of the components she ordered was tomatoes and that was missed when they made the salad.  Still in the end a very good salad.  It's a keeper for the Huntersville/North Mecklenburg area and we will be back."}
{"text":"It was everything we'd hoped for. Moist chicken, tender ribs, friendly staff, full bar and beer selection. Even the fries and coleslaw made us happy."}
{"text":"This place scores a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Slightly above average but not great.  Decent but not amazing. Service friendly but not super attentive.  Again I hate asking for water and again I had to ask and for refills.  We started with fried pickles and bacon wrapped jalapeños. Fried pickles were great however a little greasy but solid 4.5/5 in my book.  Bacon wrapped jalapeños just average 3/5. It was missing spice and flavor. I mainly tasted bacon. My husband and I split a rack of ribs which included two sides.  More than enough to share. We didn't finish. Mac and cheese was good 3/5 but I prefer a different style.  Cole slaw was great full of flavor 5/5. We finished off the meal with the small banana pudding which was perfect for two to share.  Light and fluffy 5/5.  We had a decent time but nothing to pull me back to this place.  If you are in the area might be good to try but I wouldn't make a special trip.  Just another thing we were lucky we got seats at the bar otherwise party of two was at least a thirty minute wait at 9pm on a Friday night. Usually past my bedtime Update!!! 8/6/15 I love that midtown responded my review and it was NOT a generic response it was detailed to my review. That brought then up to four stars for sure!  It's nice to know they use fresh jalapeños therefore spice on the appetizer will very.  I look forward to going back and writing a five star review!"}
{"text":"Best brisket in Charlotte hands down. Also loved the mustard sauce I prefer that on my pork. Sausage is good, sweet  corn is there best side. Wasn't impressed with the prime rib."}
{"text":"This is some of the best BBQ in town. So happy they opened a location in Ballantyne. The service is amazing (thanks Chris and Tyler) and they make you feel like you are at home.   We came on opening weekend and it happened to be Mothers Day weekend too, they were slammed but still accommodated our large party.   I had the brisket and was shocked to be asked if I preferred the lean cuts, fatty cuts or both (I picked both). I'm glad they offered b/c they both were delicious.   We can't wait to come back to have a beer or two with some good Carolina BBQ!!!!!"}
{"text":"Took a day trip up to Charlotte from Myrtle Beach and stopped here. We ordered wings and the loaded fries with brisket for appetizers. We tried all the sauces loved the sweet habernero one. Then my friend ordered the rib/chicken combo with his puppies and macaroni and I ordered the brisket sandwich on Texas toast with collard greens. Oh lawwdd! When I say the food was delicious...we had our server bring the cook out! So good and I wrapped it up with banana pudding which was amazing! This is going to be my go to place when in North Carolina. I really was that awesome!"}
{"text":"Coming to Charlotte on business and being a huge fan of BBQ, I read a number of good reviews of Midwood so wanted to check it out myself.  While Charlotte and the vinegar based sauce is not my favorite, I still enjoyed my lunch at Midwood.  I had the pork platter which was really good.  The meat is tender and the portion is very large.  The hush puppies are absolutely excellent and one of the favorite parts of the meal.  I also had the mac and cheese which I would rate as average but still enjoyable.  On top of that, as a midwesterner I also enjoyed a nice large sweet tea!  Really nice atmosphere and room to sit at the bar if you are eating alone such as myself."}
{"text":"Food: I think this is the best BBQ place in Charlotte. Definitely get the banana pudding.   Service: docked two stars. We ate here on Halloween - some of my friends are from out of town so I was excited to have them experience some Carolina BBQ. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks and food at the same time. Food came quickly. However our waitress made sporadic appearances with prolonged absences. She brought our food and left without asking if we needed anything else...and we did...she didn't bring any silverware. Our friend had to get up and go to the bar to ask for silverware. when she did appear we asked for a side of sauce. Fast forward 15 minutes...we already finished eating and she brought our sauce.  An unfortunate experience. I generally love this place and will come back for the food but don't expect the service that a five star worthy restaurant should have."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for a business trip and wanted to try some BBQ.  I am something of a BBQ aficionado, and Midwood had the best beans I ever tasted in my life.  Also, the ribs were awesomely delicious.  The day I was flying back, I checked out an hour early just so that I could have another meal there before I flew out.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love the BBQ. Friendly wait staff and the bartenders are not stingy with the liquor. Great place for lunch. Fast service and great food"}
{"text":"Food was alright. If you know BBQ then visiting a chain isn't the best way to get your BBQ fix but we decided to try it.  Worst part was the service. Our waitress brought our drinks and both drinks were incorrect. Our appetizer was brought by another waitress and our meals were brought by a manager. Definitely won't be back because $71 can be well spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cool for what it is, but it ain't all that. I'll have to give this place another try and have the wings since I hear they're really good. I came here on a Saturday night to order take out and the place was PACKED. Like, no room to move packed. Ordered the food and I think it took about 30-35 minutes. $35 bucks for the \"Pig Out\" platter was enough to feed 4 ppl. The meats had decent flavor and were pretty good, the sides were just ok. The pickled onions were good!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited this location on a Saturday in September. We had an amazing server, I forgot his name, I believe it was Drew. My daughter and I enjoyed the BBQ Queso with shredded beef brisket, Burnt Ends and a half rack of Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs. Yummy. This was my first time visiting the location, I decided to eat outside but the flies wanted to enjoy my meal too so I had to take it to go but I heated my food up later on and it was yummy :)!"}
{"text":"First time giving these guys a try and I LOVED it! Shantel was our server for lunch today and she killed it. She was friendly, efficient and above all very knowledgeable about the products. She brought us out small sides of each of the sauces to try and, though I liked the mustard the best, they are all great."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town to attend the Carolina Panthers verses the New Orleans Saints game.  When we asked for a good place to get some BBQ, this place was recommended.  The service was excellent and our food was delicious.  Our only complaint was that it was un comfortably cold, but the manager graciously adjusted the temperature."}
{"text":"I love this place! So much better than the old bbq place that was there. The manager Joe was so nice and helpful And Our waiter Mark was phenomenal! Great service overall. I ordered the brisket and it came out a little fattier than I expected, but the manager and waiter came over right away and replaced it for me no questions asked! And fast! The burnt ends were amazing too! I would def recommend this place to anyone who wants good bbq!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to try and don't skip dessert the pecan cobbler is great not too too sweet just right!"}
{"text":"Small wait the later you go in the evening, but we'll worth the wait.  We got the bacon wrapped jalapeno peppers, pretty ok.  Not great.  They come 5 to an order with ranch dipping sauce.   We reached ordered ribs, I got the creamed creamed corn (can you say OMG!!!) The best I have ever had, my partner got sweet potato fries.   The plates came with ok hushpuppies, I have had way worse.   The ribs were fall of the bone tender, no knife or fork needed there.  They are  a dry rub, but the ribs are super moist.  You can get them sauced or sauce on the side.  A sweet habenaro (a little kick) sauce or a Smokey sweet sauce.  Both were really good."}
{"text":"Overall Midwood gets 5 stars! Good BBQ and a great place. We left a lot fatter than when we walked in.   We were staying in Charlotte downtown and found this place on our way in. Our visit was on the 21st of July of 2017.   Food - I'd give 4 stars! The food was really great, but I've had better BBQ.   What we ordered: We ended up getting the combo with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. Our sides were cream corn and beans.   The ribs were dang good, cooked perfectly with a nice amount of smoke. Lacked the flavor that I've had in other places...but real close to being amazing. Same with the brisket.   The pork, however, was outstanding. Some of the best flavor I've ever had on pulled pork, and it was perfectly juicy.   The cream corn was also outstanding! The beans were a bit of a runnier mix, also good. The beans worked really was a dipping sauce!  We also got some hush puppies, which were about average for hush puppies.   NO CORN BREAD!!! WHAT THE FRANK??? Why no cornbread? What does the chef have against cornbread? Why did they deprive me of this tasty side dish?  The ambience - I'd give 5 stars!  The place feels inviting and comfortable. Big tables for all the food you're going to order, comfy seating, good bar, TVs, nice outdoor seating, and clean bathrooms.   An added touch was the plates and dishes! They aren't boring and plain...feels like something you'd find at grandma's house.   The staff - I'd give 5 stars! The host was really friendly and paid close attention to us. Even let us move when a booth opened up.   The waiter was very helpful and patient with all of our questions. He genuinely wanted us to have a great experience.   We had no problems with our food arriving quickly and everything was perfect.   Conclusion This place has a great reputation for a reason and we couldn't have been more pleased. Unless the had corn bread!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat, a bbq place with fancy dishes, we loved it.  The service was excellent.  Will stop here the next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night (Tue).  They have 1/2 price martinis which was good because I needed me some vodka, and having it 1/2 price made it all the better!  Started with the queso with pulled pork.  I thought it was really good and the small was plentiful for 2 of us.  My other friend had the bruschetta and he seemed to enjoy it.  I went with brisket on the servers recommendation, and opted for lean with mac n cheese.  Brisket was good, but I wish I had gotten fatty, it seemed like it would have been a bit tastier.  The hushpuppies were awesome!!  I really loved them.  I liked the onions, they were nice and sweet.  Mac n cheese was okay, least favorite part of the meal.  Service was good, we were seated right away since it was early.  I really liked the interior of this place and they had a great 80s music station on which I loved!  I had no issue with saltiness with any of the food and I am someone who doesn't add salt to anything so I would have noticed right away.  All in all I liked it a lot and I would not hesitate to go back, its close to home too, so yay!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. I've been spoiled by the brisket in Austin, but this is fabulous!   The cream corn was super, and the hushpuppies were perfectly done. Great location and decor, and Mindy explained everything and made recommendations which were impeccable!  Thanks Mindy!"}
{"text":"got the burnt tips which were awesome and the bacon wrapped jalapenos and lets be honest, anything wrapped in bacon is delicious."}
{"text":"Well, they were out of sweet potato fries and potato salad before the dinner rush even started (we were there at 4:45pm on a Monday night) and the ribs took darn near forever, BUT the brisket sure made up for it. Best brisket I've ever had! It was worth the other issues. I do wish they'd have done something to make up for the fact that they were out of several choices on their menu."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse, where do we begin?  Let's start with service, which, to my experience has always been great! Everyone's friendly and helpful, love it.  The sauce, well, the namesake BBQ sauce is pretty good! It's a little thinner than I'm used to, but I dig it.  The hush puppies, friggin amazing. Where I'm originally from, hush puppies aren't a thing. They should be ,though, as long as they're always as good as the ones you get here. Fantastic, best pups I've ever had!  Everything else is kind of average. I've had BBQ a lot of places (there is a pulled pork sandwich in my life that I get actually emotional about every time I have it). Most of the reviews would lead you to thinking the BBQ here is that good. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but I've had a lot better Q in my day.  This place gets insanely busy. Be prepared to have a backup plan if you're trying to come here at peak hours.  We've been a couple times now, if you're really craving BBQ this will do. I'm going to give some other places a shot for now."}
{"text":"Well worth the hour wait on a Friday evening: they've got burnt ends! We first tried burst ends in South Carolina and have been searching for them ever since. We put our names in at Midwood Smokehouse and loved that they texted us when our table was ready an hour later [we walked down the street to the Thirty Beaver, the sketchiest dive bar EVER, while we waited!] We'd heard great things about Midwood but were ecstatic upon examining the menu that they serve burnt ends!   We ordered a large burnt ends plate to split with BBQ baked beans, bacon wrapped jalapeños and hushpuppies for sides. I'd skip the baked beans next time, but everything else was stellar. Honestly, I wasn't super hungry, so it was easy to split the large plate, but if we hadn't been tasting as many things in Charlotte as we could, we would definitely have had to order two plates. Also, I was surprised that the large $18.00 plate wasn't bigger then it was. Again, we weren't at full hunger, but if we were, I would've been disappointed. Midwood is a little pricier then most BBQ joints, but it is dang tasty. I might recommend grabbing an appetizer at a local restaurant while you wait instead of going balls-to-the-wall here."}
{"text":"Salmon might be one of the best salmons I've ever had.  This separates them by doing something unique in my opinion.  Everything is very good, and I place them tied with mac's for the two best bbq spots in Charlotte.  If you want ribs go to Mac's, burnt ends come to midwood.  Brisket at both locations is excellent, but prepared differently.  You won't go wrong coming here for excellent BBQ  I went here again with family in town and had the Pulled Pork Plate.  Nice portion of food for $10, but more importantly it was probably the best pulled pork I've eaten.  Tender, flavorful, perfectly smoked.  Pulled pork just put Midwood ahead of Mac's in my opinion."}
{"text":"So I have heard the buzz and had friends already go, so I had to try it too.  This place is great - I love the smokey smell and the bar area was cool. I had the large Carolina BBQ plate and you could taste the smokey flavor - Yum! I also had the mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapenos - YUM!   This is my new favorite place, and on my way out, did I notice an upstairs deck for those nice summer nights? I think so!"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, I heard rumor of a new BBQ joint opening up in Charlotte.  As I read more and more about it, I started getting excited and determined that I just had to check this new place out soon.  Well that new place is Midwood Smokehouse, and I took the opportunity today to check it out before having to head in to the office.  Nestled in the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, NC, Midwood Smokehouse is the newest restaurant opened by longtime Charlotte restauranteur Frank Scibelli.  Scibelli is the brain child behind several popular Charlotte restaurants such as Big Daddy's Burger Bar and Paco's Tacos and Tequila.  As noted in an interview with Charlotte Magazine, Scibelli's restaurant fully intends to produce serious, authentic wood-smoked BBQ.  To accomplish this goal, he traveled around North Carolina to research the state's well-known pork barbecue joints, and he also collaborated with James Beard award winner Robb Walsh on the intricacies of Texas barbecue (read: brisket).  My task for today was to see how close he came to meeting this goal.  While the location of the restaurant may be in a trendy part of the city, the interior decor was inviting.  A mirror behind the bar stated the daily specials as well as some rather interesting one-liners/  Since Midwood Smokehouse has been open for less than two weeks, the menu was a little limited.  However, plenty of options were still available, ranging from Eastern Carolina style pork to brisket to sausage made on the premises.  After perusing the menu, I ordered a half-rack of ribs (St. Louis style) with a side of BBQ baked beans.  I requested that the ribs be sauced.  In addition, I ordered an additional side of bacon-wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cheese (which I lovingly refer to as ABTs, or atomic buffalo turds).  The server was very pleasant, taking her time to go through several of the menu options and offer her personal recommendations.  After about 10 minutes, my order arrived.  The first thing I notice is that the ribs were served with sauce on the side instead of being glazed on the ribs (as I expected).  The food certainly looked appetizing, and I will get to my thoughts on the food shortly.  As I was taking pictures of my food, the general manager came over to my table.  I introduced myself to him as a BBQ blogger, and he immediately offered to bring me a sampling of their other menu items.  How could I possibly refuse?  As if I wasn't already starting to feel full enough, out comes a sampling of pork, brisket, prime rib, sausage, and other goodies.  In addition, I also got to sample all of the sauces that Midwood Smokehouse offers as well as a small sample of collard greens.  Now on to the verdict...  The ribs had an excellent flavor. The meat was not too smoky, and I could actually taste the pork rather than an overabundance of rub to mask the flavor of the meat.  However, there were two things I immediately noticed:  - The back membrane had been left on the rack when it was cooked. - The rib meat pulled right off the bone without any resistance, which signified that they were a bit overcooked.  The sausage was a very mild sausage.  It had a bit of a crumbly texture.  Since I'm not an expert on how authentic Texas-style sausage should taste, I won't give an opinion on that.  The brisket was good, with a nice texture and taste.    The pork was, in short, PERFECT!  It had a perfect savory flavor, and the texture was on point (and not mushy like a lot of Eastern Carolina style pork can be).  Honestly, the pork did not need any sauce, but I decided to try it with the vinegar-based sauce.  The sauce added an extra dimension to the pork.  Finally, the prime rib...  why didn't someone introduce me to smoked prime rib before?  Completely and totally droolworthy!  This one is definitely on my repeat list.  So would I recommend this BBQ joint?  Absolutely, with no reservations whatsoever!    This review is available with pictures at http://www.bigwaynerbbq.com/2011/05/15/review-midwood-smokehouse-charlotte-nc/."}
{"text":"Great smokey tasting pulled pork. Just landed in my top 5 in Charlotte for sure. The meat was flavorful and juicy versus one-note due to baking. The sides - creamed cord- decadent. The greens - though tasty- did not exceed my flavor development in a pot o' greens Our server, though slow, took his time to be cordial and kind so I didn't mind. Cool spot. Especially since our President et al stopped through. I'd come again and again... In a pair of cute flats though.  Gotta park across the street."}
{"text":"I was incredibly satisfied with how delicious the food was! To top it off, amazing service! Definitely a spot to return to!!"}
{"text":"I dont like smoked neat but this was 5 stars!   Enough said!  They are professionals!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Everything here is good! Seriously. Smoked wings, ribs, burnt ends, cuban sandwich, brisket. Never been disappointed. Good sides & good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The meats were absolutely amazing. Tender hickory smoked meat you can smell the fire as you pull up. Asked the waiter for recommendations and got great beer recommendations. Wasn't crazy about the queso but my husband loved it. We got the \"well fed\" combo platter and all the meats were absolutely fantastic. I'll be back if I'm ever in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Meat. Mac n cheese. Hush puppies. I died and went to BBQ heaven. This place is tried and true for their tender, juicy meat and savory sides. They have a nice wine, beer and cocktail menu and so much yummy food.  Hubs and I went here on a date night. Expect a wait, because it's a popular place. But you can join the wait list on yelp prior to going ;) We waited about 25 minutes for a first available table, which wasn't too bad. We got a table inside, which is spacious and nice. Patio seating is more intimate. Hubs got their new featured drink called the French Canadian, a whiskey-based cocktail, and he really enjoyed it.   For food, we decided to split the 4 proteins, 2 sides meal and ordered ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket with sweet tater fires and mac n cheese. This shared option was the smaller of the two, but it was plenty of food for us! We both left so stuffed. The meals also come with delicious hush puppies and a spicy BBQ sauce and a vinegar sauce. Everything was really, really good and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time visitor to Charlotte and was brought here by some local friends. We ordered the Pimento Cheese Fries and Brisket Nachos to start and the Nachos were the table favorite. Then we had brisket, ribs, BBQ chicken and brisket burnt ends. My favorite meat was by far the ribs, although it was all delicious.  We also had the Mac & Cheese and the Jalapeño Creamed Corn. Both were very rich flavors, ya know not bland like some sides. Our server was very nice too!"}
{"text":"Came here while I was in town for my cousin's wedding. I was super excited to try BBQ here because that's what this part of the US is known for!   It was time to splurge since I don't come here often.   My group ordered two Pig Out Platters for the four of us.  Pig out comes with 4 proteins, 2 sides, hushpuppies, and pickled onions.   What we got:  Proteins:  - lean beef brisket: skip out on this and indulge in the fatty beef brisket because it's so worth it  - fatty beef brisket: so juicy, tender, and fatty. It literally melted in my mouth. My favorite!  - St. Louis Style pork ribs x2: fell off the bones, and super yummy!  - chopped pork: don't recommend. It was kind of dry and too smoky.  - hickory smoked sausage x2: Just okay, nothing out of this world.  - chopped chicken: Same as the chopped pork.  If I come here again, I would order 2 fatty beef brisket, pork ribs, and hickory smoked sausage. I also got the sauce on the side which was a good move because I don't like my bbq drenched in sauce!    Sides:  - Collard Greens: didn't try  - Smoked Veggies: surprisingly very good. My favorite side! This is a must!  - Classic mac & cheese: wish it was more cheesy  - Crinkle cut fries: wish it was more crunchy!  - hushpuppies: wow, so crunchy on the outside! SO GOOD.  - pickled onions: didn't try this because I dont like pickled stuff  It was quite a lot for us and we went home with leftovers.   Our waitress was really friendly! Great customer service.   Definitely a must when in Charlotte! Even Hillary Clinton & Obama thought so!!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved from Texas to North Carolina, and I have been on the hunt in Charlotte for a good barbecue spot. Midwood Smokehouse was almost unanimously recommended to me by everyone I asked. It took me awhile to visit, however, because my friend had a poor experience-- he had food poisoning following a visit to Midwood.    I finally decided to try it out when my parents came to visit last month, and we all loved it. Everything was great, and that is saying a lot because we are particular about our barbecue!   Great drinks, great food, fun atmosphere!   Needless to say, I was really looking forward to my second visit when my SO came into town. The second time around, Midwood was very packed. We waited an hour, and the meal ended up being very disappointing. The meat was dry and the service was lackluster. To top it off, the next day we were both sick!  So disappointing! Definitely won't be going out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Ummm, Yes.   That about concludes it.   The last time I visited here I had the brisket queso, and my goodness was it amazing. I'm not even a fan of brisket and I couldn't get enough. I also tried the smoked wings - which are offered naked or sauced. Next time I know to go with naked. The wings alone were amazing, but the sauce just didn't do anything for my personal taste. It didn't taste like much of anything to be honest. I couldn't pinpoint it as spicy, it wasn't barbecue, couldn't find any taste of ketchup. So I could definitely do without. But otherwise I'll be back soon.   Location wise, I had to turn around 3 time's because I kept missing it. It's easy to drive right past since its connected with a larger office building, and not to mention the parking on weekends is impossible. But none the less, delicious food."}
{"text":"(5/28/17) I felt like bbq tonight so my wife drove us over to Midwood. We got a trainee waitress Ally and her trainer who failed to introduce himself. I ordered bacon wrapped jalapenos. They had good flavor but no heat. The next course is nachos libre with brisket and an old Mecklenburg hornet's nest beer. My wife is getting chicken wings. The trainer, whose name was Trent but we found that out when we got the bill, had promised us BBQ sauce which was never given to us. He also recommended the excellent beer but had promised a glass of water as well that was never brought to the table. My wife asked me why I didn't remind them about the missing items. I told her that it wasn't up to me. The nachos were average at best. There was so little brisket that it was clumped in a thin strip down the center of the dish rather than spread throughout it. That was disappointing.  My wife had ordered the chicken wings on Trent's recommendation because he told her that they had switched suppliers and that the wings were larger than they had been previously. Apparently he didn't remember how small the previous wings were since my wife said that these wings looked like pigeon wings too. They were definitely the smallest wings I'd ever seen.   Well at least I have two less dishes that I will choose the next time that we eat here."}
{"text":"This place had a lot of hype coming in and was able to live up to it. I was really craving BBQ or tacos so I decided to combine the two. While these were good I should have stuck with just the BBQ. I had the brisket tacos and the meat was excellent. By the end I was just eating the meat. Beer selection, which is a must for anywhere I eat, was great. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got the Carolina pork with spicy BBQ. Liked it to the point where i would eat it again, but not enough to land it on my short list of eating destinations. i was really looking forward to the bacon jalapenos but they turned out to be not as great as i imagined. Mine actually weren't spicy at all. i actually enjoyed the hush puppies more. The banana pudding was pretty darn good and very well priced so don't forget to order it."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place sounded so good and I did not realize where it was until the other night.  Right across the street from the Family Dollar Store where Bistro Le Bon is.  Today for lunch - (I did not eat it all).  The small Combo platter was: Chopped Pork, St. Louis Style Ribs, Sausage, Beef Brisket, Hush Puppies, Pickled Onions and two sides - I chose the Jalapenos stuffed with Cheese, wrapped with bacon and BBQ Slaw.  In addition I ordered: Fried Pickles, Sweet Potato Fries, Brown Sugar Bacon (only two slices) and for Dessert the Peanut Butter Cup (a minimum of 700 calories a meal in itself)!  One at a time:  Two very excellent BBQ sauces, One sweeter Tomato Based 4.5 yelp stars.  The second a vinegar based sauce 4.85 stars.  The Meats: NICE Smokey Flavor!!! The Beef Brisket (I needed a knife and not a sharp one and only barely - this brisket was Tender)! Good flavor on its own!  With the vinegar very good 4 stars.  St. Louis Cut Ribs 4.25 yelp stars.  The Sausage was better than many and better than most I've had lately 3.25 stars.  The Chopped Pork  Fantastic 5 stars.  The Brown Sugar Bacon 3.75 stars.  Extras:  The Fried Pickles are a Winner!!!  Thin sliced perfect batter (light and Thin) perfectly cooked an Easy 5 yelp stars and I ate these with no dressing!  They needed nothing the flavor was perfect!  Sweet Potato Fries another winner 5 yelp stars with ease.  The BBQ slaw was good, no mayo, very simple, I added the vinegar BBQ sauce to it so it rates a 3.95 stars.  Stuffed Jalapenos wrapped in Bacon 3.85 stars.  The Hush Puppies and Pickled Onions were throw away items (throw them away!) and NOT factored in to my review rating and that is a good thing for the restaurant!  The Dessert was good (I ate the whole thing) though I would not order it again because I'm very picky - This Dessert will not make my \"Dessert\" list at 3.6 stars!  Yes I took photos!  Happy Dinning!  The Roof Top dinning area looks real cool so I'll be back for the Cuban Sandwich and see how it stacks up with Carlos Cafe."}
{"text":"Food is good if not great,  but the price is right and the service is decent.   For the price point it is a hell of a lot nicer than Applebee's, although if you are shopping for high quality regardless of cost.... keep shopping."}
{"text":"My annual trip to Charlotte and Midwood did not disappoint as usual. We had the Pig out and the burnt ends. They were out of this world as usual. I'm am a little disappointed that there is no more fried pickles on the menu. I hope they bring them back."}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte on the spouse program (wife had a business meeting and I tag along.) I know Carolina BBQ means pork, but I opted for the brisket. It was the best brisket I have eaten. You can get lean, fatty, or mixed, mine was the mixed. It was very tender and had just the right amount of tasty fat!!! Mac and cheese as a side was baked, not just macaroni and cheese sauce. It was very good. There is a large beer list and many choices of bourbon if that's your thing. Definitely gets a return visit if I visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"The meat-eaters had a jolly good time here, thanks to me and my Yelping prowess.  I had eaten a starkly contrasted raw vegan lasagna a half an hour prior in anticipation of this meat feast because as you can imagine, not the most vegetarian friendly place!  At least the sweet potato fries were good and service was on the better side.  So that pleased me well enough.    Given that Midwood Smokehouse is such a sought after lunch joint, do anticipate a bit of a wait.  I think we waited around twenty or thirty minutes - sufficient time to cram in a game of cornhole.  I killed it, that's what vegans kill . .. games?  Nice touch offering this distraction during the wait!  Anyway, the omnivores REALLY enjoyed their meaty selections - can't quite recall everything, but I think there were some leftovers, which a late flight arriver was more than happy about receiving."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest. It's been a long quest.  I do believe it just ended at Midwood Smokehouse in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I just tasted the best brisket of my life.  I don't know how Midwood's chefs took the meat and turned it into this perfect art that delectably melts in your mouth. You can also order a side of bacon-wrapped jalapenos, which are delicious and spicy!  Midwood also has a plethora of stuff on tap, including the local brews for those of you, like me, enjoy sampling the hometown fare.  The service and atmosphere was fantastic! Bright and warm to the point where you'll never want to leave.  You also have never tried pork until you've had their Carolina Pork. With locally made vinegar, that stuff is awesome!  Midwood is a BBQ must while you're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ok, so when the guys at the Westin, the Uber driver, AND the guys at the guitar store all agree a place is good you can generally take it to the bank. I was not disappointed.  I didn't have a reservation but just walked up at 6pm on Sat night which is risky but the host was very gracious to offer a spot at the bar where I could stash my bulky guitar case from my unexpected purchase (it happens) and still keep an eye on it.  Sat next to a guy who was from upstate NC who come to Midwood every time he's in town and he recommended the 1/2 chicken with SC mustard sauce. I got the fries and coleslaw as sides and it came with a generous portion of hush puppies. Very tasty!  Fries crisp and coleslaw had the delicious tang of North Carolina. The bartender was very attentive.  I got a good chance to just look around and enjoy the atmosphere being there by myself and I saw a lot of good times, good service and good food. Folks, this is a can't miss place if you are looking for good barbeque. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I brought a group of ten people here for dinner.  Due to a severe rain storm and flash flooding the majority of my group arrived later then 2 other people.  My ONLY issue is that they refused to seat them until we arrived.  These people were my guests and I wanted them to have a drink before we got there.  I didn't like that policy at all.    We ordered the Hogapeno Dip, a Queso Dip with Meat, a Queso Dip without meat, Fries with pimento cheese and the Bacon wrapped jalapenos to start with.  WE LOVED EVERYTHING.  My personal favorites were the Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and the Hogapeno Dip.  OMG!!!  So good.  We ate every appetizer and everyone raved about how much they liked it.  I had the Carolina Pulled Pork with Creamed Corn and Cole Slaw.  PERFECTION.  Then I ordered a pig out platter for everyone to try all the meats.  The ribs were a huge hit and the brisket was amazing.  But those who ordered the burnt ends were in heaven with their choice.  They LOVED IT.  Since we had pigged out on the starters, we all ended up taking our items to go.  The Pecan Cobbler was so decadent and everyone loved it.  I had the strawberries and cream pie and it was delightful.  Our server was awesome and so polite (that southern charm is always appreciated).  He even took a group photo for me as well as one of himself.  LOL  A great night was had by all and I can't wait to come back EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Its part of the \"Charlotte experience!\" to me. On my first visit, we happened to find Midwood Smokehouse. While I do not go all the time now that Charlotte is my home. Anytime I have a visitor, I make a point to bring them to Midwood Smokehouse. I love the Carolina Pulled Pork. The sides are all delicious. Its great value for the money."}
{"text":"We ordered from this Restaurant using Door Dash. I was not impressed with the food. The food had a heavy smoke flavor like they used way too much liquid smoke in it, and it even seemed to be in the side dishes as well. It could have been that it was just so overwhelming that it permeated everything, not sure. The hush puppies were great. Also, for the price I was expecting much more food. I was very disappointed and will not be ordering/visiting again. Instead, I'll drive across town to Jim and Nicks."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Well Fed\" meal in which we chose: double Brisket, pulled pork, sausage, collard greens, slaw and added a side \"Burnt Ends\" for 5 dollars.  Drank local beer Cowboy Betty.  I really enjoyed the Pork barbeque although it is not traditional North Carolina BBQ.  It had a delicious sweet & smoky flavor that was able to hold its own without adding any sauce.  Very tender and tasted as if basted in drippings from the cook.  We asked for a bun or roll but it was not available.  We were offered Texas Toast but did not try it. 4.75 Stars  The sausage was also very good. 4 Stars  My friend John really enjoyed the brisket but I did not.  The texture was right and passed the pull test but my piece did not have the smoky flavor I was looking for.  It didn't have much flavor at all.  I gave John the rest of my brisket and he said that his was better.  Not sure if I was just unlucky.  It tasted better with the Midwood Sauce on it. 2.5 Stars  We were really excited to try the Burnt Ends based on the waiters description.  They were a bit dry and texture was a little tougher than I had imagined.  2.5 Stars   Collard greens 3.5 Stars Cowboy Betty:  Really nice wheat beer. 4.5 Stars Slaw: 2.5 Stars  Service was nice and waiter was well informed about the menu but he didn't seem to be focused on the floor.  Once food got out, employees seemed focused on conversations with each other and did not look back at the tables for longer than normal periods of time.   All in all we really enjoyed our meal.  The pulled pork, sausage and collard greens were excellent and we would highly recommend the restaurant if in the Charlotte, NC area."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Midwood Smokehouse. Was seated promptly.  Jalapeño appetizer was excellent.  Between us, we had the BBQ chicken, ribs and brisket.  Everything was good but the ribs were the besr. Deliciously seasoned so sauce was not necessary.  I also loved the BBQ beans, my favorite side for sure. In my opinion,  they could have put less ice in the drinks.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"God Bless traveling with my best friend because one thing I know for sure is we are (Eating BBQ). This time we happen to be in Charlotte so we hit our trusty Yelp App and landed at this BBQ gem. Getting a 5 Star from me is extremely hard, but this spot hit all the marks. The Carolinas are suppose to be known for their bbq so I figure it was be solid, but this blew me away. Exploring the menu, they didn't have just your typical meats like Ribs, Pork, Chicken, and Brisket. They had all of them plus some BBQ pitmaster specialities sure as Burnt ends for Pork and Beef, along with some pulled chicken, but the thing was surprising was they had smoked salmon. That is something you just don't see at BBQ and let me tell you, it was cooked perfectly and tasted incredible. So between us ordered the Brisket which was cut from the Point, some pork burnt ends, Salmon, and Pulled Chicken. All were awesome. The sides were standard- they compliment the meat. The mustard bbq sauce was one of the best I have tried recently. I used the Carolina vinegar sauce for my Collard.   All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Upon arriving I was a little skeptical because I've lived in Charlotte for 30 years and have never eaten there, or even heard of the place until recently. My daughter had an appt nearby, and asked if I could meet her for dinner there, along with her sister. It was a lot bigger inside than I first thought. The hostess was very friendly and smiled when she greeted me. That instantly made me feel welcome. It smelled so good, and the atmosphere was more like a diner. They do serve beer here and our waitress was very friendly and did a great job keeping our drinks filled and getting fresh beers when we were ready. Their pricing was very reasonable, and my chicken bacon sandwich and sweet potato fries were perfect! Generous helping too, and I couldn't even finish it all! My only recommendation is that I think they could do a little more to update the decor a little, however I will definitely visit again and next time bring my hubby!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Charlotte BBQ spot... Amazing specials! Try the Brisket fo sho!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ feast with tremendous sauce and great service."}
{"text":"Had chopped pork with vinegar plate for dinner. Loved it! And I know my pork because I'm an Eastern NC girl. They got the vinegar sauce just right. I had the baked beans and collards as sides. Delicious! Can't wait to return to Charlotte to enjoy Midwood again."}
{"text":"Some good old BBQ action.  This place has everything a BBQ place should, from the awesome menu options, to the decor, to the friendly staff.  I had the 4 meat plate with ribs, brisket, bbq chicken, pulled pork. Mac & Cheese for the side with collard greens. Yeah I was hungry, please don't judge me. All of the food was great and to my liking.    I also had me some sweet tea whiskey to wash it all down. A bit too sweet, but who cares, I was in the moment with the BBQ anyways."}
{"text":"Best bbq in Charlotte I enjoy it every time. Been here 4 times and they have never let me down!  Love this place, try the burnt tips you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had gotten a recommendation to check this place out, and so picked up some food to go while visiting Charlotte. We tried the pulled pork, burnt ends, and pork ribs (best dry rub I've ever tasted). For sides we loved the mac and cheese best. The hush puppies were phenomenal and knocked this review up to the 5th star. So tasty and with the perfect size and texture. Crispy on the outside and dense on the inside. Great meal."}
{"text":"1. The pimento cheese fries. I order pimento cheese fries PRETTY much every time I see them on the menu. These were really good. Very generous amount for an appetizer, 2 of us could not finish them. The cheese was good but it was on the more tame/bland side of pimento. I would order again! 2. I got the hot mess burger. This is a burger made with ground brisket and chuck I believe, and the waitress suggested I order it rare/medium-rare. While I will eat a steak that way, I am not as trusting when it comes to ground beef. I ordered the burger medium and it came well done. Luckily the delicious bacon-y  cheese-y condiment and the jalapeno poppers on the burger made it so tasty and juicy that the meat being a bit dry didn't bother me. If you are all about the meat, I would check the doneness before the waitress leaves. I ate the entire thing, and the collards were delicious.  3. Hubs got the large brisket plate, and he ordered the brisket \"fatty\". I will say, my husband is a barbeque snob. He smokes his own meats and spends ridiculous amounts of time researching barbeque. The brisket was dry for him...especially since he ordered it fatty. He said the sauce and the flavor were good, but it seemed to be rushed due to trying to serve customers. He also remarked that the mac and cheese was some of the best he has ever had.   So..all in all, we had some meat issues BUT we would definitely go back and try again. All the sides and the app were fantastic. The burger was still delicious even though it was well done."}
{"text":"This place is so great. As a native North Carolinian I am always on the hunt for great BBQ and this place has won my heart. They also have great sides my favorite is the baked Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The new Midwood Smokehouse speaks for itself when compared to the previous BBQ joint that resided in this space.  I remember coming in before Midwood took over and having my pick of the tables at lunch - now you have to wait 5-10 minutes on most days.  Service is however still quite fast, and my colleagues and I are typically able to get in and out within the hour.    Have tried several different options and enjoyed them all.  The mac 'n cheese is a bit too cheesy for me, but the smoked veggies and collared greens are both delicious.  Had the Abilene Press today and enjoyed the brisket and melted Gouda.  Will definitely be coming back for more BBQ when back in the Ballantyne area!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends who are not natives to NC. We enjoyed the platter, chicken, wings, and all other sorts of barbeque. Second only to the great food was our service from our waitress Haja. She was personable, friendly, and did an outstanding job. Would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Went there on a very very busy Saturday night.  I had no issue parking, but that was more luck of the draw, the parking is tight.  I guess you can park across the street, but that's not convenient and I think it costs to park over there (it's the Bistro Le Bon parking lot).  The night didn't start off too good.  We waited, and waited and waited.  One of my friends got thirsty and attempted to go in and get a drink....and that was also slow.  There were only two bartenders on duty and one was slinking drinks with a busted hand.  Like legit, he was taking off his slink to work the tap.  Anyways, we finally go table inside.  The hostess was very apologetic.  She said it took so long b/c we had wanted a table inside and out of the heat.  The night immediately turned around once we were seated.  Our waitress was fab, as was the hostess.  Drinks were plentiful and cold.  The food.  It was really good.   Honestly I got carried away w /conversation and didn't ask my dinning companions how theirs was, but no one complained.  I had the salmon sammie.  It was perfectly cooked and the corn coleslaw on top was perfection.  The hushpuppies were just OK.  I don't like them served w/ BBQ sauce.  The greens and mac and cheese were yummy, but nothing special.  The lemon chess pie was also very good.  There's a lot more on the menu I wanna try.  I'm giving solidly 4 stars.  Yeah that was a well-cooked piece of fish.  LOL"}
{"text":"Just got take out from here and was very disappointed.  I ordered a large mixed brisket and once I got home I see that my brisket looked like scrap meat and fat cap. They literally served me 10 oz of fat."}
{"text":"BEST BBQ IN CHARLOTTE. After you experience the pleasure that is Midwoods smokehouse, you will not like bbq from anywhere else. I am only writing this post for the original location. Fatty brisket, bacon wrapped jalepenos, mac n cheese, and pork ribs are world class. Melt in your mouth meats and hefty portions. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WORH ANYTHING HERE. TRUST ME AND GO."}
{"text":"One of the best places for BBQ in Charlotte.   The burnt ends are sauced and  tossed one more time to ensure greatness."}
{"text":"I love this place , but the only complaint I have is the restrestant is always cold. But there food is superior . And the staff is very friendly , I just hope that next time I go there hopefully it be warmer lol."}
{"text":"Overall we had a really positive experience here.  The food was pretty good, the prices were reasonable, and the service was outstanding.  My wife and I shared a full rack of ribs ($25) and a \"Hot Mess\" burger ($10).  Both were delicious.  Service really was the high point though.  My toddler was provided a high chair, a children's coloring menu, and crayons.  At the end of the meal, our friendly server even caught that I had left our child's food scissors on my plate.  (I'm sure that losing those would have been a headache down the road.)  I'd go again!  Food:  3.5 stars Value:  4 stars Service:  5 stars Overall:  4 stars"}
{"text":"for the sake of Charlotte knowing whats out there...this is one of my top places.    Midwood Smokehouse will probably ruin all other BBQ in the city for you...not much compares.  If there is a wait, go for it anyways...they will take your number and text you so you can leave the area as long as you are back within 5 minutes of their call.  I personally love that.  The Pimento Cheese fries will ruin your dinner in the most glorious of ways, so good, so big!  (ADD PORK)  The burnt ends are delish - as is the creamed corn.  My go-to meal is the simple Pork BBQ sandwich, with coleslaw on the sandwich - how it should be done!  Get the vinegar sauce and pour it all on!....I do a side of hush-puppies and love to dip them in their spicy BBQ sauce.  Great dinner that always leaves me wanting to roll out the door.    Thursdays are Bring Your Own Mug night - they will fill anything up to 40oz.  Very fun time and you can get really creative!  And if you like spicy do check out their Bloody Mary's!  ($5 on Sundays!)  They are really great.  The last few sips will leave your mouth burning...in a \"that was worth it\" kinda way.  I have a small list of Charlotte spots I take out-of-towners when visiting.  MW-SH is the TOP spot on my list for great NC BBQ."}
{"text":"Finally a BBQ restaurant so good that it deserves five stars. Of course it has to be in Charlotte NC.  I say that because right now I live in Salt Lake City and they struggle when it comes to good BBQ.  Those in Salt Lake City trying to build a restaurant and try to sell BBQ need to get out and go to the BBQ regions this country has to offer before attempting to sell their version of BBQ. While visiting Charlotte, NC with my wife while she had a layover, the main thing I wanted to do was spend a nice day with my her and have authentic BBQ. I searched on Yelp and came across a number of BBQ joints and the one with the most ratings was Midwood Smokehouse. I asked a couple of locals and we were assured that we couldn't go wrong here. The Midwood on Brandywine is one of four restaurant that they own and closest to our hotel. I like that the restaurant didn't go for the BBQ dive look like most do and although it is a newer restaurant it was very clean. Our server was very nice and helpful. I want to try a local beer and she gave me a few samples to try and I went with the Sugar Creek Pale Ale. Slightly sweet and yeasty flavor but doesn't over power the taste of the food your inhaling.  As for the food we decided to share a platter where you pick four proteins. Now my wife isn't a big fan of BBQ but she does like brisket so she let me pick; we had chopped pork, brisket, St. Louis style ribs and my favorite.. burnt ends.  The platter arrived in a nice presentation with hush puppies, a dollop of coleslaw along with our sides of baked beans and Mac n' cheese. My wife tried a burnt in and asked me what it was so I explained the process of making a burnt end and she it was incredible. I have had many burnt ends over the years but these were incredible. I like how Midwood sauces them and caramelizes them at the end. I had no complaints with anything that that I ate. Hickory is one of my favorite woods to smoke with and I like that it gives such great color and if you do it like these guys you get a nice light smokiness to the meat. Our next favorite was the brisket and then ribs and chopped pork. When she came up for air my wife said it was so good the food didn't need BBQ sauce and she was right but the sauces are good too, just not necessary.  So when it comes to BBQ Midwood is the real deal. I'm looking forward to returning to Charlotte and go to their first restaurant."}
{"text":"If it wasn't so expensive, I'd hightail it back yonder. Great portions for just one person (for God's sake, it was big enough for you to be full for supper and have a reasonable lunch for the next day)!"}
{"text":"Wow...that was some meal!  My family and I stopped into Midwood for dinner one night while I was in town for the Democratic Nat'l Convention and boy did this place blow my mind.  First, the ambience is perfect.  There are lots of TVs in the dining room allowing you to keep up on all of the games.  As for the food, I ordred a full slab of ribs...the BBQ was awesome.  On the side, I enjoyed the sweet potato fries and collard greens.   The back porch tea was really tasty (sweet tea, Jack Daniels and muddled lemon) C.J. was our waiter...he was very attentive and friendly.  The only downer is its location.  I was staying in a hotel downtown and it took about 10 minutes to get there.  Nevertheless, I would take a plane, train or automobile to get back to Midwood!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had east of Texas!    I was visiting from Southern California, and I am sure glad I stopped by. Everything that we ordered was amazing, and the large selection of local breweries was also a great plus.  When I visit Charlotte again, I will make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and close to my Army Reserve unit. Food is alittle pricey and they have smaller portion sizes but the winning flavor is present."}
{"text":"Thanks for accommodating my family for my husband birthday celebration. Everyone enjoyed the great food and the waitress just made our meal enjoyable. Hats off"}
{"text":"The staff was excellent as usual. The food is the best BBQ in the Charlotte area by far. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I give Midwood Smokehouse a 4 star rating, up from a 3, because of the manager response to my previous review.  I was so impressed by their dedication to quality product and service that I think it deserves another chance.  I'll let you know in a couple of weeks!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The hush puppies were the best and they had a ton of side options!"}
{"text":"I yelped best barbecues in Charlotte and I think this came up as like number 7 (can't remember) and it was he best choice I made on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I got the dry ribs with the sauce on the side and the bacon wrapped jalapeños. The meat was so tender! The hush puppies were delicious! The wrapped jalapeños were amazing. The establishment looked quaint, but I wanted to sit in the park to enjoy the beautiful day. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I had the Carolina pork with fries and bacon covered jalapeños. The pork was very good with the vinegar sauce. The jalapeños were very interesting, I recommend them if you like strange combinations."}
{"text":"My fav!! My big sister and I go just for apps!! Awsome.. love love love this place.. great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Solid food - great service. I was here 7 or so years ago and found myself in Charlotte again so I decided to stop by. The food was delicious - I did ribs and brisket with sweet potato fries and jalapenos. The jalapenos were a little soggy so that was disappointing and the brisket was a bit on the dry side for my liking. The ribs did not fail and I devoured them happily. I did dessert last time and was not extremely impressed but maybe that has improved - however I did not revisit that tonight so I cannot comment. My server, Christopher, was awesome and super helpful. Great balance of social and helpful without being overwhelming. If you are craving BBQ this is a great option"}
{"text":"We got so much food here. It's a good spot for bbq, and worth trying if you're in the area.  Bacon wrapped Jalapenos - So I'm probably not the target demographic for this since I hate cheese and bacon, but I think if I liked those two items, I probably would have liked this.  Smoked wings - I liked the smoked version better than the crispy version. Actually had a nice smokey flavor. Although I'd probably skip the wings in favor of some of the other bbq options.  Burnt Ends - I wasn't the biggest fans of these, but some others in my party loved them. I guess it just depends on if you like this kind of stuff. I was honestly expecting it to be more crispy, but I've never had burnt ends before, so no point of comparison. Also not a huge fan of BBQ sauce in general, which was the main flavor component for this dish.  St Louis Style Pork Ribs - THESE WERE SO GOOD. Very tender and flavorful. You have to get this.  Beef Brisket - I thought that this was okay, but not spectacular.   Carolina Pork - I really liked this too, very flavorful and tender.   Hickory Smoked Sausage - Not bad, although I feel like ribs are just always going to be better than sausage.   The hush puppies and pickled onions were also great accompaniments to the meat. We got a couple of side dishes, and I quite liked the smoked veggies (although they were a bit too oily for me). The banana pudding was also quite good, though very rich. All in all, enjoyed the meal here, and I think I prefer it to City Barbecue, solely on the strength of its ribs and Carolina Pork (although admittedly they are different styles)."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were in the process of deciding whether we wanted to leave our beloved Portland, Oregon and move across the country to Charlotte when we first visited the Midwood Smokehouse.  Being from Portland, food is a big deal to both my fiance and I...a dealbreaker when considering moving.  My close friends in town suggested this place and we all went.  My fiance is a big BBQ guy and he loved what he had.  It was flavorful, moist and just enough food.  I loved all of the sides too.  We had great service at the bar and then sat outside under the covered patio.  We only had to wait a few minutes for a table, even on what seemed to be a busy night.  This made the (very long) list of restaurants that convinced us that we'd be able to survive in Charlotte.  We'll see you in July Queen City!"}
{"text":"For all of Charlotte, you cannot beat the barbeque at Midwood Smokehouse. The service can certainly leave something to be desired, but the fare is unmatched. Favorite is definitely the burnt pork ends with Cheerwine sauce with creamed corn and bacon-wrapped jalapenos as sides. Great local craft beer selection as well."}
{"text":"This was my first stop in Charlotte after being away for nearly 8 years. The food was extremely tasty, but even better than that, the service was first rate. Our waitress (whose name I wish I remembered) was extremely prompt & courteous with a great sense of humour. Our drinks never got below half empty because she was always just close enough nearby to provide excellent service, without hovering. I highly recommend the \"burnt ends\" which are not burnt at all, but perfectly cooked to be nice and crispy on the outside whole being tender & juicy on the inside. This will definitely become part of my regular rotation of great barbecue joints in Charlotte. The hush puppies were also fantastic; very well done with just the right amount of crunchy while bursting with flavour. They offer many different regional styles of barbecue, so you're almost guaranteed to find something you'll love. Excellent portion sizes, also. I tried my darnedest, but could not clean my plate."}
{"text":"I've heard all the raves... so I decided to check out Midwood Smokehouse for myself. And I'm now a convert! This place is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!  The bacon wrapped jalapenos are as awesome as others have said - FRESH jalapenos, stuffed with jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and smoked until absolutely, mouth wateringly delicious! I could eat my own body weight in them!  I had the pulled pork barbeque, which was also excellent. It was perfectly smoky, and texture-wise it was still \"meaty\" (a lot of places in Charlotte has \"mushy\" BBQ, which is a crime against humanity). The portion of barbeque was fine, although I wish I'd ordered the large plate... it was just SO GOOD!  And the rumors that Midwood Smokehouse has the best mac and cheese in town? True! It's decadent and delicious, without being pretentious (no \"truffle oil\" here!) It tastes like the mac and cheese you remember grandma making... only better! I even got dessert: pecan cobbler. It's like pecan pie, only served warm, with vanilla cream on top. It was HEAVENLY, and warmed the cockles of this Southern boy's heart! It was almost too big for one person, but was so yummy that I just couldn't stop!  My only complaints about this place are that it's just too crowded (not that that's Midwood Smokehouse's fault!) and that service seemed a bit slow. I mean, the table service is fine, it just seemed to take a while to get stuff from the kitchen to the table. But hell, the food's so good that it's worth the wait! And the beer selection (and specials!) are really good, too.  I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"First I have to admit that I often find the idea of eating ribs more exciting that the actual experience but that's me. I felt that I HAD to eat some ribs now that I live in NC, right?   This place was a drive but seeing the reviews it seemed like the best choice. Comfy hang out, good selection of beer, that's good. The bacon wrapped jalapenos were great, the smoked chicken and the mac and cheese were good but it was all downhill from there.   I had the $19 combo platter. The St Louis ribs tasted real good but they were dry. The pulled pork was dry too, which is unforgivable! Amend that even the cole slaw was dry, the worst slaw I ever had. The smoked sausage tasted funky to me and the Texas brisket was non descript and none too tender either.  Woopy-doo, if this is Charlotte's finest no more bbq for me"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times before and the food is always excellent and the waitstaff is pretty much always on point. We will continue to come and recommend them others."}
{"text":"One of the top 3 BBQ experiences I've ever had.  That's right... Not a BBQ meal, but an EXPERIENCE!  I've lived in both Kansas City and Austin, two cities famous the world over for their BBQ...Midwood Smokehouse is world class.  You HAVE to get the pimento cheese fries with brisket. Wow.  The burnt ends are the best thing the menu.  Huge chunks of perfectly cooked meat drowning in a great Fat Tire beer-based sauce.  Their Mac and cheese is great too. Excellent service and nice atmosphere.  I'll be back every time I'm in charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing!  From VA driving into town found this place on yelp... The bacon wrapped jalapeños were amazing,  the pulled pork so good,  the brisket was incredibly tender, juicy and the smoke ring says it all!  The sauces were wonderful and the sides are Great,  the baked beans were the best I've ever had! Will come back the next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"The second visit to Midwoods  confirmed that this is a great BBQ restaurant.  The combination of great food, beer,  service and atmosphere make it a fun place to  eat.  Between all of our party we managed to try all the meats in the menu and everything was perfect.  My personal favorite this time was the fatty brisket and the bacon wrapped Jalapeños.  Why have I never though of making this savory heat bombs before.  I will make sure that they become  a staple at all my home BBQ from now on."}
{"text":"Really good food. Same menu as the other Midwood Smokehouse at The Plaza but with better parking and a more open dining room. The servers are friendly and the prices are good.  Convenient location in Birkdale which has lots of shops and movie theater."}
{"text":"Girls lunch today was very good.   Interesting decor, very clean restaurant, food was really good (pork burnt ends, hush puppies, sweet potato fries--plentiful;brought half of it home), prices very reasonable, and received impeccable service from Skylar today!!!  She was awesome. Would definitely return and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"We came here while at a scentsy event. We were sat immediately. Food was good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place given all the reviews.  Got on the waitlist on Yelp.  My table was ready but I couldn't be seated without half my party there and my coworkers were late arriving.  The hostess was very accommodating and didn't give away my table.  Service was OK.  Our appetizers arrived before our drinks.  My drink was $3 off for the daily drink special and the contents reflected that... barely any alcohol, and pretty much a cup of crished ice water.  I ordered the burnt ends with Mac n cheese and collard greens.  The burnt ends were really good but the sides were just OK.  Some commented the collard greens needed to be drained as there was too much liquid.  The hush puppies had good flavor and were the perfect bite size.    A big disappointment at the table was that they ran out of ribs while we were ordering.  It was probably around 7:30 p.m. Apparently, they run out of ribs every night.  They smoke meat on a daily basis and sell what they have until they run out.  For those who ordered the combo plate that comes with ribs, they were asked what they wanted in place of the ribs.  My coworker picked burnt ends and then was up charged for it.  They were not told it would cost more and I think it's ridiculous since they were picking something else because what was part of the entree was not available by the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down, most kind, considerate, and genuinely compassionate restaurant experience I have had in a while. Being an Activities Director at a local skilled nursing facility, I employ a great amount of patience and excellence to make my residents' days happy and fulfilling. When I took 10 of them out to Midwood Smokehouse for lunch today, I was greeted with exceptional, highlight on EXCEPTIONAL service. From the servers to hostesses, each of my residents were treated with respect, consideration, and kindness. When employees go out of their way to show others the level of respect that the employees did at this restaurant today, it not only makes the dining experience memorable, but it shows that good people are in every corner of the world and are ready and able to serve others. Thank you to the staff of the Ballantyne Midwood Smokehouse for making our experience phenomenal and for showing our residents the respect they so rightfully deserve!"}
{"text":"Hostess was extremely rude because we had originally requested for a party of 8 and only 6 showed up. We had no idea till the last minute and she was acting put out and ridiculous over something called life. Get a grip and hire people who treat your guests well. We are the people who make sure you keep getting a paycheck. Food was decent but will not be back due to her rudeness."}
{"text":"I'd give this place four stars+ but they seem to have portion issues. Food is consistent and delicious.  PROS: Best brisket in the city bar none. Midwood chopped salad is to die for and the dressings are pretty amazing. Honestly, with the exception of the smoked chicken, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. CONS: I have been shortchanged on portions so many times, it's become laughable. I went to buy(and paid for) 2 pounds of pork bbq to take to a friend in New Mexico but when I got home to portion it out in zip lock bags, it was 19 ounces. Had the same thing happen twice when I got a lage brisket plate to go. Supposed to be 10 ounces but both times it was 6 ounces. Called to complain and the manager was supposed to send me something in the mail but never took care of it or followed up. Bottom line, an awesome place to eat in but beware of take out. You pay for more than you are supposed to get."}
{"text":"Visiting from Atlanta & we knew we had to get barbecue from Charlotte! This restaurant had quick efficient service & SUPERB food. I ordered the Gingerjack drink & the St. Louis ribs with a side of mac & cheese & collard greens. It came with hush puppies as well. Everything was hot & delicious. Our server Matt was wonderful & had great suggestions & informed us newbies well! Next time we are in Charlotte, we are going again!"}
{"text":"Go there. Locals say it is the best and I would agree.  We had the bacon wrapped jalapeños and the combo platter.  Banana pudding for desert was tops."}
{"text":"Okay, as far as BBQ goes... Midwood is one of the best that Charlotte has to offer. I've been here about 3 more times after 2012 and I have to say the improvement has been drastic. No wonder that Obama came here when he visited Charlotte.  This place was thought by my parents to try out, and well because of their dietary restriction/dietary preferences BBQ is always a sure winner. Something that serves fatty keto diet like options will always win them over. What won them over when it came to Midwood was the question: What type of cut would you like? Lean, Fatty, or medium?\" Yep. That was it.   The past three times that I have been here, we've ordered the platter and just shared. We also got the jalapeño poppers which was always a treat, however be warned that the spiciness of the peppers can go either way. It could be a little spicy, or it could have a little more kick to it. I guess it just depends on whatever your tolerance is.  For the combo option, we ordered 2 briskets, ribs, and sausages with sides of jalapeño peppers and greens as those were always nice to have. And for a pig out feeding us all for $34, it's not a bad price and definitely should be looked at if you have multiple people with you or just two people eating. Service was pretty good, nothing to really say about that, we came during the afternoon so it wasn't horribly busy.  Check this place out, the BBQ is good, I would say stick to the briskets, ribs, and wings (if you're looking for chicken). I can't vouch for the pulled pork or the chopped chicken as I haven't had it in a while."}
{"text":"Really friendly, professional service. Check in with Yelp. Food excellent! Bathrooms have posters of hunks from days past. So fun & funny!"}
{"text":"I've come to this new location twice so far as it is closer to my house. The first time was when they first opened the new location and the second time was last week. My friends and I all ordered the burger special, 2 cooked medium and 1 (medium rare). All of our burgers came out VERY well done. I was the only one who complained because I'm not paying that much for a hockey puck. They apologized and remade the burger,  but my poor friends had to drench their burgers in various sauces to make it somewhat palatable. The burger was alright, nothing special 7/10. Their customer service is top notch, but I'm not sure what is going on in the kitchen back there. My friends are now only willing to go back to the original location."}
{"text":"I had a craving for bbq and due to the strong yelp reviews I decided to give this place a try. I had the El Fuego tacos, hush puppies, mac and cheese, and the house slaw and it was a solid meal. The tacos are very original. I enjoyed to see a different take on a modern classic. The sides and pups were really good. I'll definitely be back to give the rest of the menu a try."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Stopped in here for our southern barbecue fix & we were not disappointed.  Everything we ate was fantastic & my husband claims this is the best barbecue he's ever eaten.  What a fantastic treat!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great time with my coworkers! First time here, will definitely be back! I had the queso with brisket and pulled pork sandwich"}
{"text":"The brisket was amazeballs!  So much flavor. And the service was spot on. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with family and we ordered the Queso with Pork, it was very delicious we ordered the small and it was plenty for the 6 of us. I ordered the well fed and had the ribs, chopped pork, pulled chicken and sausage. Everything was delicious! The Midwood original BBQ sauce was the best. The Mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy and sinful, the hush puppies were crunchy, savory and golden brown. My sister got the nachos and they had ample Amounts of smoked chicken, lots of Queso and plenty of fixins. We had the banana pudding for dessert and it was pleasantly sweet, creamy, perfect banana flavor and just enough for everyone. 4 stars only took one star off for the Cole slaw, it was not as sweet or Tangy as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite BBQ spot!! This was my first visit to Midwood & i joined a girlfriend for a night out! Our server Brian was just awesome! Being my first time he welcomed that & explained all the features & specials! He was so sweet , very attentive & always kept a smile on his face! We split an appetizer of the smoked wings & i will definitely be getting these again (along with the mustard base sauce)!!! We then split the carolina pork plate & had the bacon wrapped jalapeños as our side!! Sooooo good!!! Everything was just awesome! I'm looking forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"We went here expecting greatness. In the end, there was a feeling of disappointment with the food being mediocre. Got the half rack of ribs with hush puppies. Hush puppies were small ball of floured cornmeal. Seemed to have a pretzel-like texture. Not really as soft and grainy as expected. The ribs were far below expectation. I make better ribs on my grill, with better flavor.  Rib tips were extra crispy and burnt.    I wouldn't come back here unless I needed to.  Service was excellent, by the way!    In addition, there was a creepy waitress who kept lingering around, standing way too close to me when taking orders and talking to us, and rushed us even though she said she wasn't."}
{"text":"So, I don't love bbq maybe as much as I should.  It's good, don't get me wrong...but that much meat at once just isn't my thing.  That being said, if you do love bbq this place is 5 stars for sure!  We went a few weeks ago and after a short wait were seated.  My husband and our friend each ordered a beer that was reasonably priced, I stuck to soda.  We then promptly ordered the pimento cheese fries as an appetizer because we're fat kids and they sounded delicious.  They arrived and bonus! were topped with delicious pulled pork.  I could have eaten just this as my dinner.  We chose some sort of meat and sides extravaganza that was more than enough for 3.  We chose the bacon wrapped jalapenos and mac and cheese as sides, both were excellent.  The meats were great too and the mustard based bbq sauce was by far my favorite.  If you're in plaza midwood and craving bbq, definitely make a stop here!"}
{"text":"BBQ Pork Sandwich  Half Rack Ribs Sweet potato fries Hush puppies  ....order it. You literally can't go wrong with flavor like those. Each element was amazing and exciting to come back to. The BBQ sauce alone is amazing but so is literally everything else. You know the meat is prepared correctly when you can eat it on its own without a sauce but why not indulge if the sauce is there!? Call ahead seating is a dream, the reviews are real-we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is great! I found my new favorite bbq restaurant in Charlotte. Don't even know where to begin. Not only was all the food amazing, but so were their drinks. Awesome selection of whiskeys and craft beers. We ordered the pig out and added burnt ends. All the beats ere cooked perfectly with delicious sauces. I will be returning frequently."}
{"text":"Like the Midwood Smokehouse location in Plaza Midwood, this one in Ballantyne serves excellent BBQ with a diverse menu. Make no mistake, though, this is NOT authentic North Carolina BBQ.  FOOD: The menu is fairly diverse. I personally am not a fan of this at BBQ restaurants, but looking around at other tables, it seems like I'm in the minority. I have tried both the pulled pork and brisket (brisket is not real BBQ, but I digress...), and both are excellent. The burned ends are also very good. There is a decent selection of side dishes offered, and unlike many other BBQ places, Midwood Smokehouse does not upcharge for some. The dessert menu is fairly small (cobbler, banana pudding, and a dessert of the day), but the offerings are all excellent.  SERVICE: Not much to say here. The server was friendly, promptly refilled our drinks, and did not ask us 100 times how the food tastes. A+ for service.  PRICE: The pricing falls in line with 99% of other BBQ places. Expect to pay around $12 for a pork combo plate and $18 for a brisket combo plate. Considering that 80% of the plates are meat, I would say the prices are fair, especially since this is what almost all BBQ places in the Southeast charge.   Midwood Smokehouse is my favorite BBQ place in Charlotte. Is it authentic NC BBQ? Far from it, but the taste is great, and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Whenever I eat BBQ, I always compare the place to Lexington BBQ (the restaurant). While Midwood Smokehouse does not top Lexington BBQ, it is (by far) the best in Charlotte. The problem with Charlotte BBQ is that most places are some weird hodgepodge of different BBQ styles that ends in some strange mess that does not even resemble real BBQ. Midwood Smokehouse certainly does a good job at executing BBQ with its own twist and fair prices to boot. I highly recommend.  EDIT: I highly recommend either coming early or getting takeout. Parking is VERY scarce and long lines form quickly."}
{"text":"Wonderful smoke house! The burnt brisket tips were amazing! Others in our party had smoked chicken, salmon, pork and sandwiches. Portions were good and don't forget the desserts!!"}
{"text":"As depression set in that my favorite BBQ spot, Smoke Modern Barbecue had closed, I was just not going to visit Midtown.  Nope, not gonna do it.   It is not Midtown, it is Birkdale for crying out loud.  If I want Midtown, I go to Plaza-Midwood and hit up Midwood Smokehouse, I mean if its good   enough for Obama and her majesty Killary, it is good enough for this Yelpaholic.  That location always kills it.   Me likey!  So today, Friday afternoon, bored to tears and what sounds good, BBQ!   Wait, I am in Huntersville, traffic sucks - quick right into Birkdale.   So basically, as far as I can tell, it is the same setup, they moved the reception area, changed out the seating, but it is basically the same lay out.  Me likey!  Hey bartender, what, wait, your the same guy and chick from Smoke.  Sweet!   They can take care of a regular.    What they remember me, serve me up some fatty cut brisket and burnt ends.   Me likey!     Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends.  Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends. Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends. Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends. Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends. Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends. Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends.   Holy crap, I love this place, why o' god of Yelp did you keep me away so long.    Brisket with just enough fat to make it creamy delish.   Burnt ends with caramelized sauce on top of juicy fat morsels of delightfulness. Me likey!  Oh yeah, forgot.  The wife got the Midwood Chopped + pulled pork.  $11.   Folks, this is a large ass salad.   It is Yelp wife stamped of approval.   Score!  So good day in the Yelp solar system, the Yelp god's made the stars align into the perfect visit.    Did I say - Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends. Fatty cut brisket and burnt ends.   Yas please, bring more!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ restaurant in Charlotte with great drinks!! Exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Awful bar food.  I was hoping to get food made with love because this is a locally grown restaurant, but the food was on par with the last bowling alley bar I ate at.  I tried the fries topped with house made pimento cheese and brisket - the fries were frozen crinkle cut fries ala Orida grocery store style.  Brisket was dry and seemed to have been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.  This was one of those meals that I wish k had never eaten."}
{"text":"After my flight, I wanted some bbq because that is what the Carolina's is known for! Their beef brisket. So I came upon a few restaurants and I chose this one!   Located in a very cute area and with outdoor seating, midwood smokehouse was a cute little bbq place which serves a variety of BBQ items. We first ordered the fried pickles! Which comes with a dipping sauce of ranch dressing. The fried pickles had a distinct taste more salty than sour! But dipped in a side of ranch made it taste better!  I went for the beef brisket and a size (small) 6oz of meat, along with the Mac and cheese! While my bf chose the BBQ tips with two sides, grilled vegetables and the bacon wrapped jalapeño.   My beef brisket was juicy and good but the fan above our table just made my brisket cold immediately! So I had to eat quick! The Mac and cheese was good, came out bubbly and hot! I got to try some of my bf's BBQ beef tips and they were so dry! And hard to chew. It wasn't a good choice . The grilled vegetables quickly became cold and the only thing he liked on the plates were the bacon jalapeño!   Both our plates came with hush puppies too! And they were good, but I was so full from eating the brisket that I could only eat two of the hush puppies!"}
{"text":"IMHO this is the best barbecue in Charlotte. Love the smoked turkey plate with smoked bacon wrapped jalapeños and creamed corn. Try the brisket they can do lean, fatty, or both, doesn't matter it's all awesome. Try the well fed combo if you're unsure what to get, its big enough to feed 3-4! The beer selection is great here!"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse seems to be the quintessential Urban Bro Restaurant.  Every big business town with lots of transplants has to have at least a few.    The large crowd on a nice Sunday evening was probably about 70 percent male, which sounds about right for a restaurant serving this much meat.  A sizeable minority of the clientele consisted of the following two Urban Bro subspecies:  (1) dudes wearing pressed khaki shorts with overly bright tucked-in polo shirts, loafers without socks, and snappy golf visors (looking like they just stepped off of a Southern college campus circa 1987), and (2) dudes wearing baggy athletic shorts, athletic sandals (with or without socks), and t-shirts with logos from athletic companies (looking like they'd just stepped off a college campus circa 2014).  There were also a small handful of heavily tatted-up goateed dudes with backward baseball caps and wife-beaters (looking like they were trying to channel Fred Durst circa 2001).    Everybody else looked pretty much like normal adults.  To pull in the Urban Bro demographic, Midwood Smokehouse has even more giant TVs than average--most tuned to tuned to sports, of course--than the average meat-centric restaurant.  (But to confirm that we were in a sophisticated urban environment, and not some exurban barnyard, the TVs tuned to all-news showed vanilla CNN rather than Fox News!)  There is also an unwritten Midwood Smokehouse rule that any dude having a beer and/or BBQ solo at the bar, or waiting for a take-out order, is required to have his attention glued to a smartphone at almost all times, with small breaks allowed to eat food or catch golf action on the nearest giant TV.  The music?  Classic rock.  (What else would be possible to balance the various Urban Bro demographic subgroups?)  Besides the social anthropological amusement, Midwood Smokehouse serves up good food, too.  Chopped pork was certainly better than average, although not in the same league as the whole-hog stuff you can get in some small towns in this state.  Frankly, it was a bit salty, and the pork flavor just wasn't all that bold.  (Before you blast somebody with an Ohio address for even daring to talk about NC BBQ, I present the following defense:  I was born in NC, my dad's family is still anchored in this state, and both sides of my wife's family hail from this state.  But at the same time, I don't pretend to be any kind of BBQ expert.  I only justify my right to opine.)  Before we left, I got the impression that the burnt ends are what you get here, but they were sold out when we got there.    More impressive were the sides, which are just an afterthought at too many BBQ places everywhere.  Smoked veggies are a nice idea, and the collard greens were just the way I like them:  leafy, not overcooked, and suffused with plenty of smoky meat flavor.  Because this is a big urban restaurant, serving only BBQ won't do:  The menu also features burgers, sandwiches, salads, tacos, and more.  Decent selection of draft beer, too.  A word to the wise:  The $13 large BBQ plate might sound expensive at first glance, but it is a very generous portion of food.  You probably don't need to go that way, unless you're very large and/or haven't eaten all day."}
{"text":"the ribs and the brisket were KILLER. my goodness, we had a variety plate and I wish I would have only ordered ribs. The sides were also flavorful, and I appreciated the variety in sauces available. The brisket fell apart en route from the platter to my plate...that is how tender it was. I was pleased with this stop and would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not a beef fan but I tore up some brisket for the first time and would do it again happily"}
{"text":"The best BBQ I have had hands down. We use to live in the University area and we ate here all the time, but we moved to the other side of town and don't get here as often as we would like. So I was over here this week doing Father's Day shopping for my husband when I realize exactly where I was. I called my husband to get his order and made a quick beeline to the restaurant. Place our order and within 10-15 mins I was out the door. Now the hard part was driving from central ave to ballentyne with that great smelling flavor playing with my nose was the hardest part and often wanted to sneak in the bag and grab something out, but I didn't want anything unless I had the entire thing, so I waited.   Once I got home I don't remember taking the keys out the car because I was so excited about mid wood BBQ. When I took my first bit I almost slapped my husband because it was so good (joking) but it was good. It was just how remembered. On this round my husband got the wings app with Mac and cheese and collard, all that were great, and I got the pulled pork with collards, with was great.  I have had everything here and I recommend everything. Smoked sausage, wings brisket, pull pork everything is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Just needed some good food so saw this had a lot of good reviews and was nearby.  Not a very large place and parking isn't plentiful in the immediate area, but don't let that detour you from stopping in.  You can start smelling the smoke doing its work before you even enter.  Walked in at 7:30 on a Wednesday and it was crowded but were able to get seated right away at a table but decided to sit at the bar instead.  Decent beer selection and heavy on the local breweries.  Split appetizer of the pimento cheese fries, no meat on it as we didn't want to fill up, but it was a lot and excellent.  Added a little hot sauce for a kick made these even better.  Split a 3 taco plate, one chicken and two pork BBQ, liked the pork but the chicken was outstanding.  Also shared a side of the smoked veggies and collards that were both very good.  They make their own pepper vinegar and it is good on everything, especially the greens.  Would recommend but it is a BBQ place, expect to walk out with a hint of that great smoke aroma with you so keep in mind what you are doing after."}
{"text":"I very rarely give out a 5 Star review. Coming from Colorado, our BBQ options are limited. As a NC native, I know what good BBQ is. On our recent trip back to NC, we had it in our plans to find a really good BBQ place and I think we did. While this restaurant may not be approved of by the purists who think good BBQ only comes from a busted old building with linoleum floors, plastic trays and a ceiling fan, it's approved of by me and my family. Nice decor and televisions to watch various sporting events are a bonus. The prices were very competitive. We tried the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends and sausage along with sides of bacon wrapped jalapeños, collard greens and hushpuppies. Everything we had was excellent. The brisket and ribs were up there with the best I have ever had. The sausage had killer flavor. The side items were solid, with the collard greens being the best I've hand, bar none. If I lived locally, I'm afraid of how often I would go to Midwood. Thank you for fulfilling our family's goal of getting good, wood smoked BBQ on our trip."}
{"text":"Great BBQ with very good sides and sauces. We had the combo platter for two. I was a fan of the smoked chicken wings. I Love the ribs and sausage. The combo comes with 4 meats and 2 sides. We had brisket, pulled pork, sausage and ribs. Sides mac and cheese and really good beans ! Platter also comes with pickled onions and hush puppies. I ordered a side of slaw.  My daughter ordered the burnt ends (brisket) with collard greens. All the food was pretty damn good. The meats had great smoke flavor. I would go with the chicken and ribs. The pulled pork and brisket were good but not the best I have had. All the sauces, sides and fixings were awesome. I recomend this location."}
{"text":"In my opinion, best BBQ in Charlotte.  If you need some chow, go here."}
{"text":"The brisket is on point! Best ever. Make sure to ask for the spicy sauce (it's in the back) the general manager is customer focused always out walking around asking customers about their experience and helping the staff."}
{"text":"The burnt ends are legendary. I had never heard of anything like it and I've lived in the South my entire life, but it's sooo good. The hush puppies are also amazing. Definitely a restaurant that you have to eat at if you live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never reviewed this place because I've been here so many times in the two years I've lived in Charlotte.  Nothing too crazy here just great BBQ.  I want to say it's the best in Charlotte but I haven't been to that many BBQ spots in Charlotte. It's a lot better than Mac's no master what anyone tells you but I do wish they had a better selection of sauces.  The sauces they have are good but they are more about the meat and less about sauce here.  I've had the pulled pork, ribs, and burnt ends and all were fantastic. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Yep. Real BBQ, solid beer selection and professional service. Best BBQ I have had in the Southeast. Their brisket is as good as any I've had in Texas and Oklahoma."}
{"text":"Expected more from this place, given the really high ratings. Service was good, but not great. When asking about cocktails, we got a lecture about which drinks a man could order, and which ones a woman could order. What? We got a platter to share with a variety of BBQ meat and tried a bit of everything. Everything was reasonably tasty, but nothing stood out. Head up to Lexington for MUCH better pulled/chopped pork, or find superior brisket/ribs in the Triangle or out in TN/Midwest. If this is the best Charlotte has to offer for BBQ, I'm left seriously unimpressed."}
{"text":"Can you say FOOD POISONING? OMG last Friday 04/18/2014 we decided to go there for the first time, the service, food and atmosphere was awful. Never would I suggest this place!"}
{"text":"The meat was amazingly tender. I got the giant beef rib and my bf got the pig out platter. We got a lot of meat and it was all fall of fthe bone tender. Even the burnt tips were tender which was amazing and you could definitely taste the bourbon they used in the sauce for it. Even though it wasn't the most flavorful bbq I've ever had it still acquitted itself admirably. The pork brisket was also amazing. Total came out to be around $60, about $30-$25 for each dish + tax&tip.   There is parking in the back and this place is a pokestop haha. Be careful coming on weekend nights though because the line can get pretty long."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. 1st time this location. The food was absolutely great. I had the large Brisket plate and I was quite pleased not only with the quality but also the quantity. \"Almost\" to much  My lunch date had a half rack ofnDry Rub ribs.  Again very good. Very good greens. The pepper vinegar has a bit of heat to it be careful. Glad the meat had such great taste because their sauces are OK.      Our only negative was the way the waitress seemed to serve us. She never seemed to slow down,  even to ask how things are,  she said it moving. But what was really off was that she put down the check long before we even saw the food. It made us feel like,  OK Pay,  Eat and Go.  Not very inviting. But the Brisket was really good."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for one night and decided to hit up this restaurant...  The service and atmosphere is awesome!  I'll be adding this place to one of my go to places whenever I'm in town.   The smokey chicken wings are some of the best around,  especially when combined with the in-house harbenero sauce!!!  The banana pudding was like eating whipped butter!"}
{"text":"The best bbq in town. Our server drew was awesome. Carolina pork + mac + bacon wrapped jalapeños!!!!"}
{"text":"???????????????? ??????????????????????????^ ^ ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????^ ^"}
{"text":"We loved our meal here! My husband had the brisket with the bacon wrapped jalapeños on the side and said it was all fantastic. He also had the Hangary Bloody Mary to drink which he said was amazing. It comes with two smoked chicken wings and one bacon wrapped jalapeño on a stick in the drink. Very unusual but very cool! I had the pulled pork sandwich with the BBQ beans; the beans are amazingly yummy! The Hush Puppies are excellent here as well! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty great. The service was awesome and quick, place was clean and comfortable.  I'm not a BBQ aficionado so I can't really comment on how great the BBQ was in comparison to other people, but I did really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Midwood did not disappoint.  My buddy and I saddled up at the bar on a Wednesday evening and were immediately greeted by the bartender.  She promptly took our drink order and offered suggestions for dinner.  I opted for the \"well-fed\" combo platter - Carolina Chopped Pork, Beef Brisket, St. Louis style Pork Ribs, and Pulled Chicken with mac & cheese and smoked veggies on the side.  The portions were HUGE.  Everything was prepared to perfection and did not disappoint.  The meats were tender and flavorful.  Sides were more than satisfying.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. It has a cool vibe and the smoky smell as you walk in is exactly what you want in a barbecue place. Hubby is a true carnivore and was thrilled with the 4 meat combo plate, but...the service was not great and the sides left something to be desired. We started with the smoked wings as an appetizer. They were tasty but REALLY small. Hubby's 4 meat combo had ribs, pulled pork, sausage and brisket. His sides were fries and bacon wrapped jalapeños and he added an order of burnt ends. He loved all of the meats and the portion sizes are good. He's a big guy and almost went for the \"pig out\" portion, but opted for the \"well fed\" instead because of the appetizer and additional burnt ends, and wasn't able to finish all of it. He didn't even get to the sides, but he couldn't have cared less...it's all about the meat. I ordered the half chicken (all white meat) and for my sides, mac and cheese and collard greens. My chicken was good, but even though I asked, and the server repeated it to me, I did not get all white meat. I am a sides kinda girl, so I was disappointed in my mac and cheese and greens. I make them better at home. We also asked for an order of Texas toast when we ordered, which did not come out with the food. When we asked about it, they brought it, but it was unusual as it was sourdough bread and it wasn't buttered well. On top of not getting my chicken right and not getting the toast that we ordered with our food, my drink was empty when the server came to the table and she didn't notice. I had to ask for a refill. I will say she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu, but not very attentive to the details."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Well Fed\" combo plate with brisket, sausage, pulled pork, and burn ends. (Which they substituted since they were out of ribs). I really enjoyed it.  The sides of Mac and cheese and beans were tasty as well.  The service was excellent. Plenty of TV playing a variety of programs. I thought the music was a bit loud, but that wasn't a big deal.  I plan on making a trip back before I head home to Texas."}
{"text":"Went there last night at the Ballantyne location for the first time--with out of town guest.  First the water tasted very funny--the waitress told us a number of other tables complained as well.  It is very unusual that a restaurant has bad tasting water!!  They had to bring the water to our table three times--not a good start!  We order the beef brisket and the tacos off the money.  All entrees were unmemorable.  Something we would not go back for.  At the end we all said we should have gone to the Hickory Tavern instead.  Place is crowded now, but I'm sure the crowds will drop off once the 'newness\" wears off."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ in Charlotte. I know that is not really saying much seeings that BBQ in Charlotte is known for being mediocre at best, but if you are craving BBQ, and you are in charlotte, this is the best spot period.  Service is always great, food always comes out quick, and the beer is always ice cold.   I suggest getting the bacon wrapped jalapeños. Matter fact order yourself two orders of 'em and thank me later. As for the cheerwine burnt ends, I think they miss the mark, but I know people who love them. I also don't much care for the mac and cheese here, reminds me of grade school when you got the rubbery over cooked underseasoned mac and cheese with the skin on it from the lunch lady who looked like Chris Farley in a hair net, but hey, maybe that's just me. I will say if you dump some of the BBQ sauce into the mac and cheese, it defiantly churches it up a bit and makes it palatable.   This maybe the best BBQ in Charlotte, but I don't believe they have the best sauces in my personal opinion but they are a close 2nd. I'll take good BBQ with an average sauce over bad BBQ with great sauce any day."}
{"text":"Bacon        Wrapped.............. Jalapenos!  WOW  Besides loving the location of this place and the decor, the food is downright impressive!  I will never go to Mac's again.  Great drink specials and great prices on entrees.  This is as good as it gets in Charlotte.  The pulled pork was savory and moist-didn't even need sauce, and this is coming from the condiment queen!  I usually never order chicken because they are usually dried out, but I could really taste the smokey flavor come out-almost as much as the pulled pork.  This was my first visit and I will absolutely be returning!  My only complaint is that the mac and cheese could be more cheesy...just sayin...  still good though!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for BBQ beef brisket...seriously, I have tried almost everyplace in Charlotte. Sooo juicy and tender, nice smoked taste. Every time I try another place Im disappointed because its never as good as this pllace"}
{"text":"Great barbecue!!! Bacon wrapped jalapeno's are awesome! Great brisket! Lots of good beer too!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place in Charlotte. Very close to downtown, the location was convenient and in an up and coming area. I had the BBQ combo, chicken and St. Louis style ribs. Both were excellent. The ribs were done perfectly and had a great authentic smoked flavor. The mac and cheese was one of the best I've ever had, I would come back just for it.  There was a good beer selection, with several local options to try. Overall, great casual spot for BBQ."}
{"text":"This place smells good as ignites your taste buds as soon as you step out of the car. It's that heavenly smell that makes you want to order everything on the menu! Definitely get the fatty brisket and the pork ribs. Burnt ends sound better than they turned out. The combo is a good deal because you get to try 4 items. Easily shared between 2-3 people!  Stop by if you are in the Charlotte area for ANYTHING! They come out with a plate of sauces that are suggested for each of the meats that you order and most of them are DELICIOUS! Restaurant was very full and the tables were very close together.   We sat outside on the covered patio and it was perfect."}
{"text":"This is a great place for BBQ especially the burnt ends brisket. Also know to me as outside cut. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of 8. Everything was very good, from the appetizers to the drinks and, of course, the bbq. They had some inventive creations as well, including the cheerwine rib tips. A little sweet for my liking, but nice to see a creative rib place. Nice selection of cocktails as well. Good ambiance and also has a large bar area for watching games"}
{"text":"Let's be honest - I have only had the brisket and the burnt ends. But they keep me full, happy, and coming back for more.  This Ballantyne location has done very well. The staff is friendly, the food is hot and consistently good. The mac and cheese is amazing too - some days I could just get a whole plate of that and fade happily into a food coma.   The restaurant is set up with a bar towards the front, so you don't feel awkward buzzing past the host stand to get to the bar. There are tables and booths everywhere, and they even have a little patio outside. They've made this into a very comfortable, casual place to come and have dinner. You could come with the family, or grab drinks with a date. You could even take food to go - but I guess that depends on how the date is going - haha!  I had friends in town from PA, and we saw the burnt ends on the list of \"50 things to eat in Charlotte before you die\". They weren't kidding. These are incredibly good - and most of their food pairs beautifully with the NC craft beers that they have on draught. Eventually I think I'll branch out to the other food items on the menu, but for now these choices are plenty."}
{"text":"I have been blown away with the quick response of the management team at this location. After my mishap, I have had two people from this business contact me to apologize for the little situation. I admire that as a customer I am being taken care and felt they care for me.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!!!  Gabby set us up perfectly. She even brought a water bowl for our sweet puppy Pi.  Just a happy Place to be. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The Good News: Authentic BBQ smell, tasty menu, prompt and friendly service.  The Bad News: Totally generic  atmosphere and the music is loud and the worst selection of 80s rock  I've ever heard. It felt more like a chain restaurant than a local joint."}
{"text":"BBQ doesn't get any better than this! I hit the jackpot when I found Midwood on Yelp during a work trip in Charlotte. I wanted some serious NC bbq eating and I got it here. I ordered the brisket platter and my colleague got the burnt ends. We ordered mac n cheese, collard greens, and hushpuppies. We went all out and ordered the chicken wings with midwood sauce. It was heavenly. These wings were cooked and smoked then covered with yummy sauce. I'm not sure why wings are always made this way. The main courses were perfect. So tender and the sauce was perfectly executed. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is really nice. Our waitress knew the menu front and back and was a real help.  I really need to go back to Charlotte just to eat at Midwood."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite barbecue place in Charlotte. The one off of Central is better than the one in Ballantyne. The sausage is great. The burnt ends are delicious I was suggest burnt ends over the sausage. The crinkle fries are wonderful and the greens are delicious. The vibes on the central restaurant are great."}
{"text":"So whether you plan on going to Midwood Smokehouse for the first time or fiftieth time, here's my take on a few things:  Parking - there's a larger lot in the back of Midwood. Hopefully, you luck up and are able to have ample spots to choose from. If not, street parking is available. Yup, parking sucks in this particular area of Plaza during peak hours, it is what is.  Food - you want to start off with some apps? Go for the pimento cheese fries (with brisket). Generally, I am not a fan of pimento cheese, but I will gobble these cheese fries right up. Also, order some bacon wrapped jalapenos simply because you must (personally, I'd ask for them to cook them just a little longer than normal).  -Midwood chopped salad (with pork or chicken). Yes, I go to a BBQ place and order a salad because it's really good. In fact, it's my favorite salad in all of Charlotte. The small portion is quite large enough for me.  -As for actual BBQ, go for the pulled pork and/or smoked wings. On a recent visit, I learned there's Midwood sauce so make sure you ask for some of that as well.  There are ample reasons why this place is consistently busy (I just listed a handful above) but they get right down to serving really good food in a friendly and fast manner."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while visiting a friend- great place to grab some barbecue take-out. We chose to avoid a sit-down because it was crowded and loud. The Carolina pulled pork is great- light vinegary sauce packed on the side so you could put it on later. Hush puppies were good too. The Mac and cheese was thick and creamy and the noodles were cooked just right- not mushy like some places. Husband had the tacos and loved them! Our friends are regulars here and we know why!"}
{"text":"I am eating lunch here right now and had to stop to write this review. The Cuban is phenomenal and it is on its way to become my new favorite sandwich in Charlotte. Paired with some nice golden fries makes it a truly delectable dish. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch, 6/2/14, seated immediately, friendly and knowledgeable hostess. I am an Eastern Style NC aficionado, having eaten it all my life. Others at the table did not have this bias. [g]  Of the items I tried, I'll make comment. Ice tea rather bitter and watery, $2.00. Tasting the sauces -- 5 of them -- was great. I don't know if this is offered to every new customer but it should be. The one with the Habernero was my favorite and really well balanced. The Eastern style sauce was good, actually very good, but just a tiny bit on the sweet side (as Bob Garner said). But seriously, ask for the sauce tasting if you don't get it; they arrive steaming hot.  Stars of the show: The fatty brisket. You must request it well marbled, and it beats anything I ever had in two driving trips across Texas. Next in line would be the ribs. Request them without sauce and use the sauce tray you earlier requested. They were moist, tender, and not too much char. Third star was the sausage. It's a rather sophisticated blend with a natural casing; they don't grind it there but they smoke it there.  The hush puppies are fine, though probably started out as a mix. On this day, the macaroni and cheese was just too dry and one dimensional; I would not order it again. The collards were great, without as much grease as my grandma used.  I do not recommend the fine chopped pork. The flavor is not quite there and the chop is too fine for my taste, but I've met old barbeque masters who prefer it that way. The vinegar/pepper sauce wakes it up for sure. I asked about banana pudding and was told that they use the old time method with Nilla Vanilla Wafers; that's something to try next time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Norwood Smokehouse, and it will not be my last. Shantel was our server, and she was excellent. I decided to try a few new things: Burnt Ends (of bee brisket), Smoked Vegetables, and their Collard Greens. I can not properly describe how delicious the Burnt Ends are! I really could eat just them for the rest of my life and be eternally happy. The Smoked Vegetables did not disappoint -- yummy!  The Collard Greens were the way I like them as they did not contain too much vinegar; however, for those that enjoy more Shantel did offer me vinegar if I had wanted more. Everyone at the table was really pleased with their meals. Norwood Smokehouse is definitely on my local favorites list. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ spot in Charlotte.   Being from SC I was happy that they offered a South Carolina mustard for their dishes as well."}
{"text":"Just want to start by saying that the service is excellent. Our waiter Matt was exceptional and knew what he was doing.  The food is great, the beef brisket being my favorite. The pork ribs are also tasty but the chicken is just okay. Jalapeño wrapped in bacon and the baked beans are the better sides.  Will be back for sure next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before??  We went to Midwood on a Wednesday night at 8 p.m. and were greeted and seated immediately.  We were in a bit of wind tunnel because the overhead fans were on full blast.  I then  realized that was a good thing; since they actually smoke the meat, the fans help circulate the declicious smell.  We wanted to try everything, so we split a Well-Fed Combo Platter and got the pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs and hickory smoked sausage.  (I can't imagine how many people the Pig Out size would feed!)  It came with three sauces: mustard, vinegar and the tomato-based Midwood sauce.  The pork and sausage were great, but fairly standard; the brisket and ribs were phenomenal. The ribs fell off the bone, and the brisket was tender enough to cut with a fork.  We also got mac & cheese (great) and bacon-wrapped jalapenos (just ok).  Our server was very attentive and fun, and we rolled out of there miserably, happily full."}
{"text":"Bbq is everywhere in the Carolinas. However, what I tried at Midwood Smokehouse stood out! I recommend going with the sampler platter and trying it all with a partner. The best meats were the ribs and brisket. Normally ribs at restaurants are grey bland meat, but these ribs were full of flavor and very meaty. Good selection of beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"This place smells good as soon as you pull into the parking lot. I have always wanted to try real north Carolina BBQ on my many trips passing thru NC . This being my first time staying in Charlotte my girlfriend searched and found Midwood. We had a combo that was delicious and fried pickles for appetizer (you don't see that in NY). The staff was friendly and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great find just off Route I77. It will be a regular stop on out travels. Such a friendly experience. Workers hustling all over the place. Fast service, awesome BBQ. The Burnt Ends were my favorite. Great Briquet, Mac n Cheese. We own 5 Big Green Eggs and do lots of BBQ  but learned something today about southern cooking.  Try the spicy Habanero sauce...it was the best."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Big Daddys burgers so when I heard that their owner opened a BBQ place, we were eager to try it.  In a nutshell, It was fantastic and reasonably priced.  Our kids loved the ribs, and sweet potato fries.  My wife thought her salad was amazing, and I loved the Half Chicken with the combination of sauces.  Finally, we have a great BBQ place in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"This is a great low key place to go and enjoy awesome BBQ. All of the food is great. The staff is friendly, and the food always comes out fast!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, best bbq in North Carolina!! Highly recommend! The Brisket is top notch!!"}
{"text":"Violet - VIOlet - VIOLET was awesome! We have been in Charlotte 48 hours and everyone has been nice but Violet understands her customers, is very attentive, and made the perfect recommendations for our food! Wings (dip in Habernera BBQ sauce! Result = Great! We visited 6 Bars yesterday and had every intention on doing the same tonight but VIOLET! Not only her but the kitchen staff made great wings, Management frequently asked how we were, and the Locals have been fantastic! This place has AMBIANCE man!!"}
{"text":"Every thing we are here was outstanding.  The brisket is the best I have ever had.  Friendly service, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in the area.  I lived across the street and ate a whooole lot of BBQ during that time. I would recommend everything on the menu, particularly the bacon-wrapped jalapenos, baked beans and pork."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service  Burnt ends are great."}
{"text":"This place is located about 2.0 miles from the heart of downtown Charlotte. I'm not a huge BBQ fan but was in the mood for some on this day. We waited for about 35-40min on a Saturday night. This place is a very busy place and loud on the inside. Our server told us that their popular dishes are the Carolina pulled pork and beef brisket. He emphasized that the burnt ends entree is one of their best sellers. With that being said, I opted to try it. I started out with their chopped salad as my appetizer. Easily one of the best salads I'd ever had. Very simple but loaded with flavor. Get the green goddess dressing on it. The salad has chopped cucumber, black beans, corn etc in it and it's topped with fresh avocado. My entree was ok. The burnt ends were salty to me and the flavor of \"charred\" ends was overwhelming. I would get their regular beef brisket next time, as I am sure it is delicious. My sides were wonderful. I had their smoked vegetables and collard greens! Their hush puppies were really good! Despite my experience with the burnt ends, I think this establishment offers wonderful BBQ food, if you want some good ole southern BBQ! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Omg...everything was amazing.  Between two of us we had pulled pork, sweet potatoe fries, mac and cheese, brisket taco, and pulled chicken taco. Everything was amazing.  Even the sweet potato fries,  which are almost always good,  were perfection. Tacos were amazing with just the right amount of spice. Accompanying slaw was excellent and unusual.  Pulled pork was taken to new levels with their pickled onions and pepper vinegar.  Yum."}
{"text":"So me and KB the largest leprechaun were in Charlotte this week and we wanted to hit up an authentic barbecue joint to find out what this North Carolina barbecue was all about.  we decided on Midwood largely because to get four stars across 290 reviews with yelp is an accomplishment.  For me it's all about the food yeah the ambience is really nice and when I arrived I was pleased to find the corrugated sign out front with the flying pig I mean how bad can it be.  We started our meal with the stuffed jalapeno wrapped in bacon and as far as they were concerned definitely very spicy very moist very cheesy and the bacon was crispy so I'll put those at the top of the list is the best jalapeño I ever had.  Both KB The largest leprechaun and I ordered the combo plate.  I opted for the brisket smoked sausage chicken and St. Louis ribs.  I decided to order the ribs dry because if I wanted them wet i could always add sauce.   For my size I ordered the coleslaw and the mac & cheese.    I like to start with the good stuff so let's just say it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had. The brisket was moist and the ribs were above average.   The smoke sausage was sausage it's pretty much always going to be good.   I could tell KB liked cause he ate everything on his plate and it was Eyeing some of my plate as well.  My minor complaints where the pulled chicken I think they include too much of the white meat and/or if it happens to be yesterday's chicken.   I would just skip it.  And I'm not used to the way they serve cole slaw in the south it looked like it was put in a food processor just not my thing.    The beer selection is nice.  And the service was very good.  Only mix up with what type of dessert we wanted we ordered the bread pudding were served the banana pudding I think the waiter was hungry and really wanted the banana pudding. It was very good. The reason we don't get five stars because even though there was some serious highlights the jalapeno poppers and the mac & cheese the barbecue was very good but not the best ever."}
{"text":"We had never been here. Service was great and the food was excellent! Asked the waitress what was popular. She recommended the Abilene brisket sandwich. Not to mention the Classic Bloody Mary was delicious! Great choice! We will go again!"}
{"text":"Couldn't visit the South without have some good southern BBQ!  BF and I visited here because of a recommendation from work.  We came here on a Tuesday night and were seated right away.  This place has a bar area and a restaurant area, and we were seated in the restaurant.  Looks like there is an upstairs and patio too which I guess they open on weekends.  The place was about 3/4 full the whole time we were there.   BF and I shared the \"Pig Out\" combo platter ($31) where you can choose 4 meats.  We chose ribs, brisket, chicken, and chopped pork.  It comes with their infamous hushpuppies, and we chose mac n cheese, bacon wrapped jalapenos, and Texas toast as our sides.  It also came with 4 different BBQ sauces: South Carolina Mustard, Vinegar, Midwood Signature & Spicy Habanero.  I liked the spicy a lot actually, but it's not even spicy; it has just the right amount of kick.  Signature is the runner up, followed by the vinegar, and finally the mustard, which i didn't care for much.  The food itself was delicious although the chicken was kind of dry.  The sauces went with the meats well, and the Texas Toast was the cherry on top.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone whose looking for good Southern BBQ."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Midwood Smokehouse and honestly I don't think there's anything special about the food. Our service on the other hand was outstanding. My boyfriend ordered the Carolina pork which he couldn't even eat because the after taste was terrible. The waitress then told us that the after taste was probably the vinegar that was in the pork. We hate to make any trouble but we just couldn't stand the taste of it. She nicely offered to take it back and get us something else. My boyfriend then ordered the burnt ends. He liked it much more than the Carolina pork but still it wasn't that great. As for me, I got the 1/2 chicken. The only pro was that the serving was huge but I was disappointed that the chicken barely had any flavor. I had to constantly put salt and black pepper on it just for it to taste ok. The cream corn had a weird taste to it and I just didn't care much for the collard greens. The only thing I probably enjoyed was the hush puppies. I didn't want to cause more trouble than we already have so I just tried to eat what I could.  Even though the food wasn't great, I'm giving this place a three star for their service. They took the food back with no trouble and constantly checked up on us. Everyone was very nice and our waitress was very understanding.   To conclude this, I probably won't be back just because the food was mediocre. But thank you to Midwood Smokehouse for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Ugh so disappointing. The other Midwood got such great reviews and I had my expectations set so high for this one, clearly too high. It's been open for a month or so now, but I haven't been since yesterday. I was really excited to get some good barbecue and went to Midwood with a friend on a Sunday afternoon.  The inside of the place looks great. Lots of wood colors that you'd expect at a barbecue place and a good amount of TVs. The bar even had power sockets which is a fantastic touch.   I got a half rack of ribs with the dry seasoning (per the waitress's advice, usually I go with wet ribs) and hushpuppies on the side. The food came out quickly, and the ribs looked delicious from the outside. The best ribs should be able to be eaten with a fork and no knife at all. These ribs did not pass the test. Lots of the meat was very tough and required heavy knife and mouth work to get it off. Not good. The taste was average. I didn't love the dry rub, but the sauce it came with was excellent. The hushpuppies were fantastic--not too heavy or buttery.  Our waitress was pleasant but really nothing more, maybe a little bit rushed. I wouldn't be running back to Midwood, but it would do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Stopped in Charlotte for a night on the way back from Georgia. My wife recommended this place based on it's Yelp rating and the fact she knew I was jonesing for BBQ while in the south. We ended-up splitting a BBQ platter that included ribs, Cheerwine (soda) burnt ends, pulled pork and brisket; sides included mac-n-cheese, collard greens, hush puppies and coleslaw. I also ordered banana pudding to-go because I can't pass it up when eating BBQ. While I only had one, the beer selection was great and very local, which was exactly what I was looking for.   They also have tacos. I didn't order them, but it seems strange and worth mentioning.  The ribs were amazing. They were a little saltier than I've ever had and I still can't discern wither that helps or hurts them. Everything else was really good, but not great. The coleslaw and hush puppies were almost tasteless. There was a lot of mediocrity here, but I'm giving 4 stars based on the ribs, banana pudding and beer selection."}
{"text":"Be ready to wait in line but the food is great. The bacon wrapped jalapeno's are so good and the Cuban sandwich is one of my favorite things on the menu.  I love the crispy ends brisket but they were about 2/3 fat when I ordered take out and was a bit disappointed. It is a fun restaurant with slightly challenging parking but that is to be expected in that area."}
{"text":"The reviews on yelp & confirmation from the hotel employees brought me here - and they didn't steer me wrong. This place is a gem!  So many items on the menu caught my eye, but I decided to get tacos to try 3 meat options & that were amazing. I ordered the brisket, pork & special taco of the day made from pulled ribs.  Service was great from the hostess to waitress (Mindy) & management staff. Mindy was so patient, attentive and gave great recommendations. I felt more like I visited my good friend's house than a restaurant.  Will definitely return on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good bbq! The burnt ends were delicious and the coleslaw and hushpuppies were great. The ribs were a bit over cooked and dried out but still had great flavor. The bacon wrapped jalepanos were good but the bacon could have been cooked a bit longer. Mac and cheese was good too. Skipped the smoked vegetables - those were no good."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I can NOT believe what I just witnessed at this location. I was waiting for my take out order to be completed and I happened to look over and witness one of their server's take a shot of whiskey or tequila which ok none of my business but apparently that wasn't enough for her alcoholic ass  so she proceeds to open up a straw and stick it in her table's drink and pull it out to taste, now luckily she did not go back in for seconds, but nonetheless, she was blatantly stealing from the restaurant which btw ends up costing you and I because that loss has to be made up. But this was at their bar counter on the backside in plain site so my deepest concern is what is she doing in the back as she goes back there to grab our food. I'm going to go out on a limb and say she's taste tested some of our food along with our drinks. The most troublesome thing is not knowing whether she has hepatitis or herpes, or anything we as customers can contract from her nasty habits. It is of the upmost importance that we all done in a safe and clean establishment and are not put at risk because Erik the manager felt a warning would be sufficient with dealing with, theft since she didn't pay for the drink and if she did why is she drinking on the job? I'm sure ABC would like to know how they are working within the limits of the law when it comes to drinking on the job."}
{"text":"1. Bacon wrapped jalapenos 2. The little crunchy pieces of ice 3. Awesome local brews on tap  Do you really need to know more??"}
{"text":"I love BBQ and am very critical of it.   I was in town for a short trip, and tried this place due to the reviews.   I have to concur, this is pretty good Q.  I tried the special that was written on the glass - stack of ribs - for 9$.   For that, I think I got 7 or 8 short meaty pork ribs with a honey glaze.  Not what I am used to as far as the sauce, but great flavor, cooked right,  and nicely presented (ribs were neatly stacked up).  Had collard greens and they were delicious.   The only negative, I wasn't hungry enough to try one of the combo plates (since there were plenty of warnings that it was a lot of food).   Nice place, nice atmosphere, and very good Q.  I rate 4 stars only because I wasn't able to sample enough of their foods."}
{"text":"Had CJ as a waiter. He was great and helpful. The BBQ was smoky with great bark. Sides and sauces were unreal. Will be back each time we come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food was ok. We started with fried pickles and the bacon wrapped peppers. Both were tasty. My table ordered everything from ribs to chicken to burnt ends. The meat was ok. It's not the most mouthwatering BBQ  I've ever had, but it was fine. I think everything could've use a dash more of seasoning. I'd eat here again, but will still be looking for excellent BBQ inside the city limits."}
{"text":"Delicious with good service and a great patio situation should it be busy inside. But the parking is not fun. Did I mention the food is delicious? There is only one other place in Charlotte that I have had BBQ that can compete with Midwood Smokehouse...and I will gladly keep comparing to see which is best lol"}
{"text":"Just within a few hours of my arrival to Charlotte, I received a few strong recommendations to try out Midwood Smokehouse, so obviously I had to check it out.   Pimento Cheese Fries: Large dish of fries piled high with a generous amount of melted cheese on top with pork. How can you possibly go wrong with ordering this dish? It was absolutely delicious and addictive, a dangerous combination. Highly recommend this dish.  Burnt Ends with side of bacon wrapped jalapenos, hushpuppies and pickled onions: Brisket was on the dry side and a bit difficult to chew. Did not have enough bbq sauce on it. The texture of the jalapenos were too soft/soggy and nothing special--just literally jalapenos wrapped with bacon with no seasoning or flavors that I tasted. Hushpuppies were good and the pickled onions were a necessity to balance out the meat. Not my first choice to recommend.  Half Rack of ribs with sauce: Again, the pork was dry, but it did taste good though.  I'm no bbq specialist, but I think I had my fair share of very good bbq. Overall, I found this place alright. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Our first time out for a dinner meeting. Won't be the last. Outstanding, friendly service and delicious BBQ. When I asked for a Pilsner or some kind of light beer option, the waitress was beer-savvy and gave great recommendations, too. Looking forward to returning and trying more of the wide variety of food options."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is amazing. The East Carolina sauce is the best. The Hush Puppies are perfect. I didn't eat here, I actually had the leftovers after a plane ride and it was still so good!"}
{"text":"For a smokehouse, these prices are pretty good for what you get! We went around lunch time and our waiter was Tobias. He was super friendly and very knowledgeable on the menu. We had the pimento cheese fries as an app. If you love pimento cheese, this could be a dangerous new restaurant for you because they are soooo good. I ordered the brisket and my friend ordered the SC chciken plate. We both got large orders so we could try two of the sides. Neither of us could finish the portions we ordered so we had leftovers. The brisket was wonderful! Super tender and flavorful. The chicken was really good too! Both dishes came with pickled onion and hush puppies. (The hush puppies were really good) The jalapeño wrapped in bacon comes as a side and was the perfect amount of spicy. The coleslaw was a little underdressed and overchopped for our liking. The mac and cheese was pretty fair too. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Beef Brisket - Recommended by a national-traveling-smokehouse/barbeque-self-proclaimed connoisseur and I will have to agree - best brisket I've had since West Texas! Mac & Cheese pretty close to Mama's too!"}
{"text":"Here on tour. Pretty much perfect - get the combo platter, try all those great NC sauces. Baked beans were a nice surprise. Essential eating if you're in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for BBQ and was not motivated to go through the trouble of cooking it myself. It is allot of work!  Decided to check out Midwood's based on reviews and how far the drive would be.   My kiddos had the chicken fingers. I had the chicken and rib combo with a side of coleslaw and beans.  Chicken was very tender. Ribs were meh. The meat was a bit tough and quite salty. The coleslaw was very good. Chopped finely and not too overbearing on the vinegar taste. Baked beans were meaty and the bbq was strong in it.  The chicken tenders are good but overly breaded- according to the kids.  Pecan cobbler was excellent.  Decent dining with bar atmosphere. Perfect place to hangout or for drinks. Attentive waitstaff.  Not sure if I will come back for the ribs. Maybe to try the salmon or have another warm slice of pecan cobbler."}
{"text":"A solid average.  Tried pork and brisket both dry, honestly my wife makes better pork BBQ with the crockpot.   The bar seating is a bit irritating.  The bar has elevated booths in which the hostess has to seat you.  However the footrests are set so far under they are effectively useless leaving your feet to just dangle.  Atmosphere is nice, good selection of beers.  As a BBQ joint that folks want to rave about can't say I will be in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Yum!!  Clean, super friendly, food is delicious.  The Hot Mess burger is so good, even without the bun. Our server Brittany was awesome. We are from out of town but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times but unfortunately this time wasn't  good. The garnish on the Bloody Mary was wilted, bones in the chicken sandwich, spoiled coleslaw, and hush puppies that were the size of a dime. Not many people on a Sunday early evening. Don't think they will make it if they don't improve what they serve. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a few other Wounded Warriors for dinner and let me tell you it was delicious! Everything that was excellent! The waiters were extremely polite. The atmosphere was clean and friendly!  There is something about Southern BBQ food that I love, and this place has it going on.  I defiantly will be back to Midwood Smokehouse when I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I normally don't like BBQ/brisket but I had a small plate of their beef brisket (with a mix of fat and lean) and it was DELICIOUS!!  It was so good I had to pack the rest to go as I flew back to NY, haha.  So YAY to that!!!!  As for sides, I had the hushpuppies, pickled onions and mac n cheese.  I did like the pickled onions but the mac 'n cheese was quite dry and tasteless.  Ah well-our server was really awesome, though!"}
{"text":"The best beef brisket I ever had! Service was awesome! It was my first time there. It certainly won't be my last!!! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. A reputable BBQ house should not try to pass off cubed brisket put under a salamander as \"burnt ends\". They were dry and certainly not authentic.  Ribs were on the dry side as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week, were able to sit outside with our group and puppy. The smoked wings were delicious, the chicken bbq platter also very tasty. The cream corn was a little heavy on the cream, light on the corn for me, but the collards were amazing and made up for it. All in all, great lunch, definitely recommend going back."}
{"text":"The wings. That's all I need to say. Came here with a large group, our waitress was awesome juggling all of our food and drink orders. We all ordered a variety of food and really the main thing that we ended up ordering more of was the wings! Perfectly cooked, little crisp, amazing seasoning. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok. Sorry, need to update my review.  We went to Midwood Smokehouse last weekend.  Got the ribs again.  They weren't nearly as good as the first time.  Not sure what happened.  The salad was very good though and so were the greens.  But, a little disappointed with the ribs this time :-(.  Probably the best ribs that I've ever tasted.  Soooo good.  Also had the make your own salad which was awesome.  My daughter ordered collard greens which she said were better than mine and she loves my greens.  I told her that she ought to be glad that she was sitting so far away from me.  But, I have to say that they were good.  Not vinegary like some places.  Personally, I don't like vinegar in my greens.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ with lots of delicious sides to choose from. Great date spot in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Pro: The customer service is good here most days.  Con: The food portions differ from other locations and it seems to be overpriced than the other locations.  The reason it grades three stars is the customer service."}
{"text":"Pro: big portions of food.  Con:  The location has the worst customer service inside and delivery. If I see one more worker at the bar eating while she is working. Really, that is unsanitary and bad customer service."}
{"text":"I went to mid wood smokehouse on a Saturday night. That was a mistake; the wait for a table wasn't too bad - only 20 minutes but then it took an additional hour to actually get our food. It was extremely noisy and I was seated in the corner facing the wall which didn't help the perception of how long we waited. Moving on... We ordered the brisket and the smoked chicken. My partner said the sauce was just ok and the beans were terrible. I tried them to see if she was overly critical and have to agree. I don't know what they were thinking when they paired the flavors for the beans. This taste was definite not Texas BBQ. The smoked chicken was also just ok. It tasted as if it had been boiled and then smoked for a very short time. The \"smoked\" veggeis were grilled not smoked. Service was mediocre at best. Again IT WAS NOISEY!!! Suggestion: Get rid of the multiple TV screens (or turn the off) and turn off the canned music, and have some good live music to keep people entertained if you make them wait. And pay the musicians! All in all food just OK, service mediocre, atmosphere thumbs down!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites in the neighborhood! We have never had a bad meal here! I even ordered my thanksgiving dinner from here for my entire family last year! It was great! Better get here early for dinner! It fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"While traveling threw North Carolina I was in the Charlotte area this place has some of the best authentic NC bbq around the decor inside is laid back and pays homage to the pig the staff was friendly we were traveling with a large group of over 10 people and we were seated in less then 10 minutes the menu is straight forward they stick to the basics but they do it right their beef brisket is fatty and juice it's so tender it falls apart in your mouth it has the perfect bark on the outside while tasting juicy and moist they have a pig out platter which gives you the option to pick and try 4 proteins along with 2 sides the pulled pork is juicy and their ribs are fall of the bone with just enough smoke in them they have a large selection of beers and drinks which makes this location perfect for coming to enjoy some authentic NC bbq their max and cheese is amazing cheesy deliciousness their nachos are so big yo will have left o era unless you share"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Midwood many times and never wrote a review of it before. This past Friday night, I wanted to take my boyfriend to Midwood because it's his favorite place for BBQ. We had a modest wait for a table and were seated and served quickly by friendly staff. The food was excellent (save room for the banana pudding which is amazing) and the server was friendly and helpful. I really can't say anything bad about the food or the service.   The reason I decided to review it this time is because it is the LAST time I will be eating at this location. Friday night, there was no parking, at all, on the Midwood side of the street. We had to park in the lot across the street. This is where things got really dangerous.   We waited and crossed appropriately but a huge, white monstrosity of a truck decided to make a left turn and not yield to pedestrians! I was in the middle of the road and it came barreling toward me stopping INCHES from my body!!! I screamed and dropped my purse literally frozen in fear. I ran across the rest of the street as fast as I could and was barely able to enjoy my meal because of the scare crossing the street. The truck didn't even stop to see if I was okay.  If you plan to eat at this location, plan to Uber or Lyft and don't even think about crossing that damned road with or without a light. I gave this review four stars because the food was excellent but the nonexistent safe parking means I will not have the pleasure of eating here again... but I'm very thankful to be alive and unharmed. #pedestrianlivesmatter"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Midwood ensured that it won't be our last! Guests from out-of-town wanted some \"real Carolina BBQ\". Since we wanted to show off our lovely city, we went to the Central Ave. location. We could smell how delicious dinner would be from the parking lot! Our server was helpful and friendly and attentive without hovering. Everything we ordered (and the table was groaning, I'm sure) was spot-on! Meats were tender and smoky, sides were all delicious, hush puppies were crunchy and delightful. We all left happily filled up and the one in our party who \"was never really crazy about barbecue\" is now absolutely converted and anxious to return. Definitely on our list of favorites now!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally made it out to midwood smokehouse. Food is incredible; I took our server's recommendation of the brisket and could not have been more impressed! The sides held up to the brisket too. I went with the mac&cheese and bacon wrapped jalapenos. I can't wait for my next visit.  Service was great; friendly and attentive.   Parking can be difficult, but there is a decent number of spots down the street."}
{"text":"I think I'm finally ready to call this the best BBQ in Charlotte. After having been here a few times I have tired enough different menu items and they were all incredible. The smoked wings are ungodly good. I am not the type that normally orders an appetizer but I got these on chance because we were waiting for a friend to show up for dinner. They were so good that I make sure to get an order and opt for a smaller dinner to fit them in. Not that skipping dinner is any better. I did not see anything special in the pulled pork, though it is pretty good and not too dry. But the smoked veggies as a side are delicious and worth skipping the fries. The rack of ribs is also out of this world and I might start ordering that instead of the pulled pork. It is very flavorful. I'm seriously salivating like a Pavlovian dog just writing this review and looking at my calendar to see when I can next get over there."}
{"text":"Has got to be the best brisket I've ever had, bar none!  Smoked wigs are also delicious too!"}
{"text":"One of my husband's all time favorite places to eat. Im a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish, so I get the \"get hooked\" salad or I make my own. The salmon is smoked perfectly and I love the smoked veggies. The service is always prompt and friendly, and you have to end the m eew all with the banana pudding."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends while visiting Charlotte. The restaurant is nice and gives a homey feeling, the food smelled and tasted like you were in your buddy's backyard relaxing and grilling. Great food, good service, no complaints at all. A combo platter is more than enough food for one person, you'll be fine and have leftovers.  Good: -Good informative servers, will answer BBQ questions and even make recommendations if you ask -FRIED PICKLES, do it.  -If you're not sure what to get, pick a Combo Platter below is what I chose- -Carolina Chopped Pork -Beef Brisket (get it with medium fat, it has more flavor than the lean cut) -Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs (THE TASTIEST OF THE SELECTIONS..BY FAR) -The sides: Mac & Cheese (a must) -Collard Greens (had a little spice to it) -BBQ Baked Beans -The Pecan Cobbler with a scoop of ice cream if you have room -The sweet tea was just sweet enough and not heavy/syrupy  Bad: -Being picky, but I don't think there were enough hush-puppies served with the combo platter -The Chopped Chicken BBQ did not blow me away with flavor, you're not missing anything special, you come for the Ribs and Brisket"}
{"text":"SO so so so good. So good. Vinegar based bbq sauce is to die for, the one with a hint of sweetness is also pretty amazing. Delicious pulled pork, perfectly cooked sweet potato fries and a bowl of cold slaw I would have literally dove into if I could have.  Exactly the meal we were looking for  you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Midwood is my FAVORITE BBQ place in Charlotte. From the jalapeno poppers to the fried mac and cheese brick and the chopped BBQ salad everything here is FAB!!! I can't say enough good things about this place. If you like BBQ you have to try this place."}
{"text":"First time in North Carolina from California. Looked up what food I should eat local cuisine. Had the pork sandwich with barbecue beans and coleslaw. It was well worth it. I thought that I was stealing as the food was so good and the price was so little."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm a bbq snob having lived in Texas. I'm rather unimpressed with this BBQ that everybody is always raving about. I've had the brisket, pulled pork, and bbq sandwich. The Mac n cheese is very underwhelming. Service has never been a problem."}
{"text":"Get your BBQ fix at my overall favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte. I've only been to the Plaza Midwood location but it has brought me back multiple times. The restaurant vibe is less of your old-timey country kitchen and more of a casual-hip roadhouse feel with a touch of junkyard.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos appetizers are usually a fan favorite of my group. I always like to order from the classic BBQ plates section, with the mixed fatty and lean beef brisket leading the way. The more fun and recommended selection is to go with a combo platter to share with a friend(s)! You get to mix it up and find your own favorite taste.  Drinks are plentiful with many cold beers and crafty cocktail selections. There are multiple dining spaces to accommodate for different occasions. Importantly, the wait staff have always been friendly and fun, eager to give you popular recommendations."}
{"text":"Food: the food was good, but way too small for the cost. The restaurant had a large variety of options, yet everything I saw was too pricey for the size of the entrees. Whenever I think of a BBQ joint, I think large generous portions, not 4 strips of brisket and a side for $14. The food was good, but I had to go to ANOTHER restaurant afterwards to be full. I will not be coming back or recommending.  Atmosphere: the restaurant had a good feel to it, very relaxed.  Service: service was VERY slow at first but we were able to get food quickly after ordering."}
{"text":"I now understand why this place is so highly rated. By far, the BEST brisket I have ever had..melt in your mouth goodness. Was not a big fan of the burnt tips, but everything else, including the collard greens and Mac and cheese were delicious. Don't forget to also order the banana pudding, so yummy."}
{"text":"Cold beers, Fried pickles, burnt ends with hush puppies and smoked vegetables. Finished with banana pudding. Would do it again and again."}
{"text":"Can we say bacon wrapped jalapenos?????!!!! Delicious! I originally went here with my boss, of which he ordered these and I am now their biggest fan! The BBQ here is also delicious -- definitely one of the best, if not the best, that I have found in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! From Texas was told to try bbq down here not to bad! Not to big of a fan of the Mac and cheese but the meats were amazing!"}
{"text":"The ribs were good, the sauce without a doubt add a nice kick to the juicy ribs. The service was certainly good, however there is room for improvement. The atmosphere was good and customers seemed happy with the food. There is plenty of parking in the area and location is relatively accessible. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Damn that was good! Just left the restaurant. We were passing thru Charlotte on the way home to Ohio. BBQ was the last item to check off our vacation to-do list. What a way to finish our vacay!  Under the category of Best-I-Ever-Had: Brisket Ribs Mac n cheese Ice tea  Two word review: Yum and Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed feeling 3 star review because I wanted to love this place so bad after hearing everything about it. I almost want to say a real 2/12 but I guess 3 will work.  First we got a warm welcome, interior is nice, cool looking bar, nice tables, overall good feel inside of the restaurant. Our server was cool, yet a bit awkward. He did his job well, but when asked questions about how some of the meat was prepped, he kinda seemed to be caught off guard.  One big thing I learned, which was a huge turnoff for me was that all pulled pork, no matter how you order it (platter, sandwich) is pulled and put right into their vinegar sauce.  Yes, they will give you other sauces with it, but the vinegar still bites right through, and that is a huge turnoff for me, and 3 out of 4 of the people at my table did not order pork because of that.  Otherwise, I got brisket (both lean and fatty) was excellent, sides were all good. My wife liked her mac & cheese. In laws loved their chicken sandwiches though thought they were a bit dry, alas with more sauce very good.  Would I come back? yes. Would I ask more questions about how the bbq is prepped and cooked? yes. It seemed our waiter was a bit confused. But our drinks were filled all the time, and food was delivered and check on is a reasonable amount of time. So he did his job well."}
{"text":"I met a friend here on a Friday night.  Table for two around 8pm.  No wait at all!  We sat inside in one of the big booths.  We were a bit undecided regarding what to order, so ended up getting the sampler.  We chose beef brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and the smoked turkey.  Sides were Carolina slaw and bacon wrapped jalepenos.  Everything was delish!  The jalepenos were AMAZING!!!  My favorite meat was probably the ribs, but the turkey was also great.  They also served the meat platter with 3 different sauce sides.  The classic BBQ was great.  Though my experience was great partly because of the excellent company, I have to say that the food was great, as well as the service.  We took awhile to actually order because we were chatty and our server was patient as can be.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great location of a really cool restaurant concept. The location on Johnston is never crowded and much more mellow than the plaza location. We like to stop in here for lunch, especially when we have out of town guests. Their Bbq is great and they have excellent drink specials. We came on Easter Sunday and I ordered a Bloody Mary (3 dollars off on Sunday). I've had consistently good service here. I love to get the chopped salad and add BBQ salmon. There are choices on the menu for everyone. I LOVE their jalapeño mule, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent, had an awesome drink (jalapeno mule), and the beef tips are to die for. Definitely worth a small wait."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Got the burnt ends with bacon wrapped jalapeño and it was some of the best bbq I've ever had. My only regret is getting small instead of large."}
{"text":"5 stars go to Priscilla the Bar  person she was excellent pleasant and courteous and efficient I ordered the number one sandwich I forget the name of it that was brisket with Gouda which surprised me that it had Gouda in my opinion the brisket should've been  stand on its own and it was served as a Panini rather than the sandwich which again I was surprise  I will go back but I would not order that sandwich again I had brisket recently at a place down further on 521 the city barbecue brisket by itself was excellent"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we normally love midwood smoke house, so I'm going to give it 3 stars. We decided to stop by here for a large banana pudding on the way home. When we got home and took it out of the bag we were very disappointed. It was half full. That definitely wasn't worth $5.50. Come on midwood! You're better than that!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to midwood tonight and both got the Carolina pork with the NC sauce and midwood signature sauce. He got a side of Mac and cheese and I got the creamed corn. Everything was overly salty. When the manager came to inquire how our meal was, we politely let her know everything was overly seasoned. She switched my corn for the collard greens but they ended up being salty as well. She also brought out another plate of pork from another batch. Luckily this was not salty. The waitress also gave us complimentary desserts. I've been here before and thought everything was delicious. I don't know why everything was so salty but the service was decent except for the wait. Overall we were there for more than an hour."}
{"text":"Best barbecue in America and hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! If I was on death row, I would want Midwood's pulled pork and mac n' cheese as my final meal. It's THAT good! I love their vinegar barbecue sauce and the mac n cheese is made with cavatappi noodles and is like no other macaroni I have ever tasted! When Obama and Hillary Clinton came to town to campaign, this is where they ate. It's simply THE BEST."}
{"text":"Cory from customer service contacted me and asked me to give this midwood location another try.  This is a follow up to my prior review...  Went in for lunch on a weekday and sat at the bar again.   Was greeted and served immediately.   Order was taken and food arrived promptly.   My wife ordered a pork sandwich and I had the pork plate.  The pork was great.  This time the fries came out hot but still not as crisp as I like them.  They were good just a little too limp for my taste.  Cole slaw was good.  Hush puppies were great.  And I loved the pickled onions.  Two complaints:  1) the music is too loud for lunch time.   2) again, why no self serve sauces?  But those are minor complaints. Overall great food and a much better experience than my last time here."}
{"text":"I left a 1 star review for the South Charlotte midwood location so I wasn't particularly looking forward to trying out this location.   But my wife and I were shopping in the central avenue area and since we parked behind the building and didn't want to walk far we decided to try midwood out for lunch.    Wow what a difference!  It was very busy so we sat at the bar.  I had the pork sandwich with cole slaw and fries.  My wife had the brisket with hush puppies.  Everything was great!  Fast service too.  We took a few hush puppies home and our dog loved them too.  My only complaint is they don't have a variety of sauces available in self service bottles.   I like to mix and match my BBQ sauces and try different combinations.  That's part of the fun of a BBQ place imho.  Nevertheless, the food here is delicious.   I'll try the other location again since it's much closer."}
{"text":"Eight of us went to the Midwood Smokehouse today for lunch.  It was a a great experience.  Two of us shared a four meat (pulled pork, ribs, brisket, and sausage).  We had sides of Mac and cheese, and bacon wrapped jalopenos.  The meat selections were excellent, very tasty!  Everyone enjoyed their lunch.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I love places like this. Mac's has always been my go to for bbq and because it's a cool atmosphere, but Midwood may have just taken the #1 spot. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This has (embarrassingly?) been my staple since moving to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood a couple months ago.  Love so many things on the menu from the collards & baked beans to the sweet tea & beer menu to the burnt ends, chicken, & ribs.  Great staff.  Lots of seating options- patio, bar, high & short tables."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte...maybe even in all of NC.  Fantastic food, great atmosphere.  I recommend the pulled or half chicken.  Try to get there early on weekends, as it gets crowded very very fast.  Came back in February 2017 and tried the craft cocktails.  Very Very Good!  I recommend the brambler drink.  Excellently made and a good amount of alcohol"}

{"text":"This was my first time trying out Midwood Smokehouse.  I'm a huge fan of North Carolina BBQ with the eastern NC vinegar based sauce.  Service was great. I was seated quickly. The waitress asked if it was my first time visiting and went into detail about how they are known for their brisket, that they make all of their own sauces and dressings from scratch, and they have a special smoker.  It was a Tuesday night so they also had a $3 special on all NC beers.  I will say their drink menu was lacking and confusing.  Instead of naming the specific beers they were on tap, it just named the breweries that they had beers from. We all know there are lots of breweries in charlotte with a wide selection of choices.  It would have been beneficial to be able to see which specific beer they were serving from that brewery and a description. (Not everyone is super familiar with what each local beer brewed is) I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw. You had a choice of which type of cheese you could put on your sandwich and I chose the pimento. You couldn't even taste the pimento cheese on the sandwich.  It was my first time trying brisket and I won't be trying it again. It was served on a basic piece of toast.  I only ate half the sandwich because it really was disappointing.  The coleslaw was terrible. I really had high hopes for this restaurant and would like to go back and try something else but I just don't know if I will since there are other BBQ places I have already tried that I know are better. I will say the waitress was fantastic and the food was served promptly. If I go back and try something else I will update my review. Until then, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional, but do not come here for healthy food! My favorite things to order are pork burnt ends, ribs and the hot mess burger. It's honestly hard to limit my favorite items to 3 things off the menu! I wish I could remember the name of our server the last time we went, she was one of the best servers we've had (I will add her name if I figure it out)! Being in walking distance of Midwood Smokehouse is extremely dangerous!"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse features the best smoked brisket this side of Lockhart, TX.   Definitely my go-to BBQ restaurant in the Charlotte area.   If you haven't been, don't delay.   Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Midwood Smokehouse! Although I'm a native Carolinian and think eastern NC Barbecue is the best food on earth, Midwood's beef brisket is outstanding. I also love Thursdays when smoked turkey is on the menu. And don't over look their smoked bacon wrapped Jalapeños, salmon and wings. Those might be the very best things on the menu. I haven't had a bad thing to eat there and I love the atmosphere. If you've never tried Midwood, I encourage you to do so. And don't forget dessert!"}
{"text":"Always always always so good. I will completely go out of my way if I want good barbecue just to come here. You can't get good barbecue everywhere. I'm super picky. I don't even like most places because I'm so picky. ?? especially with good sauce. Their macaroni is perfect. Not too pricey either. They have a patio to sit on too."}
{"text":"Their salads are absolutely the best salads anywhere.  I would recommend that to anyone who's a salad lover or even if they aren't.  My boyfriend doesn't usually eat salads, but here, he would help me finish it if I get full before I can finish it.  He got the Philly cheesesteak and that's the best as well.  Their brisket is among the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Probably the best \"modern\" bbq in Charlotte.   I take clients here on a regular to get a real taste of southern bbq; the brisket, smoked veggies and burnt ends can't be beat."}
{"text":"There is an upstairs patio that you can order and go up there to eat if it gets too crowded downstairs   We had to order out but the ribs and the beef brisket were pretty good  Their spicy BBQ sauce was also pretty good"}
{"text":"The brisket is the best we ever had.  Just the brisket itself would be 5 stars.  Parking: the parking lot is very small.  When we leave the parking lot, you have to drive to the back of the parking lot and exit onto the side street.  The side street has cars park on both sides and is only wide enough for one car to pass through.  When we were leaving, we nearly got hit by a car that was making a left turn onto the street.  Just be careful.  Service: great service. The hostess greeted us warmly.  Our waiter was very friendly and keep our drinks filled up.  Food: Other than the brisket, I only liked the sweet potato fries.  These were the other things we ordered: - Pimento cheese fries: Crinkle fries tasted like the frozen kind.  It was very cheesy.  My kids absolutely loved it.   - Smoked wings: too much smoke flavor for me - BBQ Pork Sandwich: It was pretty good.   - Combo platter (pig out): Three of us shared this platter and we still had left over.  We picked 2 portions of combined (fat + lean) brisket, sausage and ribs.  And the side items were mac n' cheese and sweet potato fries.  Everyone loved the brisket.  The sweet potato fries were one of the best ones I had.  I didn't like the hush puppies or the mac n' cheese at all.      Two days later, we stopped by and bought a pound of briskets (from the bulk order) to go.  The bulk order would need 24 hour advance notice.  We were lucky that they had enough for us to buy it that day.  By the time we got to our hotel, the brisket was cold.  It was still very good.  If we are in the area again, we will definitely stop by to get some brisket."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a fantastic dinner at Midwood Smokehouse. Pulled pork, ribs, cole slaw, mac and cheese and hush puppies fulfilled our 'que cravings! Our waitress, Nickey, was a true pro and gave great recommendations on dishes. She took good care of us through the night, and we loved her sweet but a little sassy personality! :-)  The manager, Jen, stopped by to make sure we were doing OK and gave us some great recommendations on what to do while in the Charlotte area. We greatly appreciated her help. Classic smokehouse atmosphere with all the guests relaxed, talking, laughing, eating and having a great time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here 30 minutes before they closed, I was wondering if it was worth getting the mashed potatoes this close to them closing. Ended up getting the mashed potatoes and  they were very fresh, everything was fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"As a certified Kansas City Barbeque Judge in the North East, I find I get weary of the molasses, maple, and tomato and brown sugar based sauces. Midwood does it right, and does it Carolina style. Mustard sauces and vinegars, all kept in a warming tray so they are served hot. Their enormous rotating smoker in the back can handle to quantities that they have to produce for how good their 'q' is. The pork is soft and pulls easily without being baby food. The brisket (the most difficult of BBQ meats) is juicy, smoky, and flavorful. The brightly colored wood interior of the dining room is festooned with old timey comic book and movie paraphernalia. Along with a welcoming staff, you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. The burnt ends were very flavorful. The baked beans were the best I have ever eaten. The coleslaw was excellent.  My son also loved the beans and the Mac & Cheese.  They had a great selection of microbrewery beers.  The waitstaff was great.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse was pretty good, but I think it was definitely over hyped for me. We are here for a quick trip and decided to try it based on great reviews, but we're a little disappointed. We had the brisket and chopped pork, both of which tasted good, but it was all a little in the dry side and not very hot. The mac 'n cheese and bacon wrapped jalapeños were delicious though, and I could have eaten a full meal of those alone. All in all it's very good barbecue, but I have definitely had better before."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on Friday night and was extremely disappointed in the BBQ. I'm a native Charlottean and have had many types of BBQ and this is not a good Carolina-style BBQ. The sauce was terrible and the pork had an odd flavor. The BBQ Half Chicken was good, but the pulled pork was terrible. The Banana Pudding was incredible though."}
{"text":"The best barbecue in Charlotte (and I eat a lot of barbecue). I take all of my Charlotte visitors here. Get there early if you want the ribs - they sell out most nights! I personally prefer the classic pulled pork but you can't go wrong. Order your meat plain and ask for all the sauces on the side to try."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere upon entering this resturant. I'm pretty certain we tried just about everything on the menu between the four in our group! Everything was wonderful, from the meat selections to the sides on to dessert. Portion sizes are huge so be prepared to either share or have leftovers to take home. We were there on a Sunday mid to late afternoon, our server was excellent. Our friends had previously shared how great their dining experience at this location so we couldn't wait to give them a try. We certainly were not disappointed in the least. They have a full service bar as well as numerous draft beers on tap from local breweries. It's nearly impossible to pick our favorite menu choice as everything was so good. If you've not had the pleasure of enjoying Midwood Smokehouse you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"Pepper is what's for dinner. So disappointed with the food after raving reviews. But most everything was so chock full of pepper it took away the taste of the dish.  We are also a family who loves heat and well seasoned food so this took us back to experience all this pepper.  The best thing we ate was the pork and beef burnt ends. Also, our server Heidi provided excellent service!  We first started with the nachos added beef brisket - it had way too much bbq sauce. Dinner consisted of - plate of 4 meats combo dinner for my husband and I (beef burnt ends, chopped pork, and double ribs) with 2 sides (mac-n-cheese and collard greens). Burnt ends amazing, chopped pork full of pepper, ribs not tender... the sides were nothing to talk about at all. Our teen boys chose Pork Burnt Ends with cream corn - Burnt ends were wonderful but the cream corn was full of black pepper which takes away the taste of the corn. The other meal was the TX Brisket sandwich - it was more bread than meat.  Maybe our BBQ standards are too high from having some of the best bbq in Kansas City but this was just average at best."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to leave, because most things about Midwood (especially the food) deserve 5 stars. The quality of the barbecue vies for 1st place in all of Charlotte every time I eat there, the local beer list is long, and the service is generally solid too.  However, over time, portions have steadily decreased. The last two times, I didn't get anything near what would reasonably be expected for the price I paid. I can go to any competitor at this point and get more food for less money, and the quality will be just as good.   Needless to say, I won't be heading back to Midwood any time soon. The quality of flavor alone isn't worth another sparse combo plate that maybe has 3/4 the amount of 'cue that it should, and only leaves me disappointed."}
{"text":"Quality BBQ at a low price! Good variety of different types of bbq (burnt ends, brisket, pulled pork, etc.) but my favorite is definitely the burnt ends. Perfect bit of crunch and great flavor, plus it's hard to find burnt ends in Charlotte. It comes with a spicy bbq sauce that fits perfectly with the meat. They have recommended bbq sauces or a large variety that you can try with your meat as well.  The sides are definitely unique, as they have much more than the normal bbq sides, including the delicious bacon wrapped jalapenos! These were definitely a favorite (you can get it as an appetizer as well.)  They have a good beer list showcasing some of the best of Charlotte beers, but also some classics as well. I went on a Saturday night and there was a pretty big wait, but luckily there's a lot in the area so you can explore (they will text you when your table is ready.)  Overall, would highly recommend to get your bbq fix!"}
{"text":"Excellent. A bit pricey when you look at the menu but portions were great and everything cooked well. The burnt ends were excellent and the full rack of ribs were a true full rack."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq and brisket. Great service. Fresh food and inviting atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere. Meat & sauce were great- I especially loved the burnt ends. The sides don't live up. The bacon wrapped jalapeños were just okay, and the Mac & cheese wasn't worth it.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I couldn't ask for more from the service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:    Great outdoor seating!  Price:   Very fare.  Food:   Excellent!  Full of flavor. Pork was yummy! - not fatty at all. Chicken was moist and tender.  Great sauces.  Hushpuppies were perfect size - and not greasy!  BEST baked beans I have EVER had! - extra flavor with the additional spices and peppers.  Portions:    Generous.  Location:   Convenient, yet parking can be tricky.  Service:     Friendly, fast and courteous."}
{"text":"love the pecan cobbler. in all its a pretty nice place!"}
{"text":"Move over Mac's this is my new FAV spot for Q!  I love the location and trendy bar.  There are several huge TV's to watch the game.  There are booths, hightops and regular tables as well as a really long bar with comfy seats.  A must-get is the bacon-wrapped jalapenos!!  VERY spicy, order your beer first, but for those of us that LOVE spicy food - this is for you!  They come out tender and the bacon is crispy and the cheese is the perfect amount of 'melty'.   I had the BBQ platter which I ordered with the BBQ Baked Beans.  The Q was super-smokey.  Totally done right, with sauce on the side.  The BBQ Baked Beans were a meal in themselves!  Very rich and the addition of peppers gives it a very full savory flavor.    Next time I am definitely going to get the brisket.  My boyfriend got it and i had to pull a 'look over there!  its Pam Anderson!' to snag a bit from his plate.  YUM.  It was so tender and flavorful - not too fatty which I love.    Definitely will head back - so glad we found this spot!  We owe it all to Yelp!  Thanks guys!  :-D"}
{"text":"I had the fried pickles, which were interesting.  The taco-trio with beef brisket, pulled pork, chicken and a bacon wrapped jalapeno.  Good, but not 4-star worthy."}
{"text":"A few must try's are: 1930 cheesesteak, pimento fries (I had them with chopped brisket) smoked wings crispy !! Oh I haaaaaaaatttte coleslaw but I got it by accident & fell in love the customer service, which everyone knows I'm a stickler for is awesome as well !!  God Bless the cooks"}
{"text":"They have the best hush puppies. But the mains are faaaar too salty for me. And I'm not sensitive to salt or anything. Heck, I'm Filipino! I love salt! But the salt on the wings and the ribs were too much for me. Brisket is delicious though!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week and ordered the salad with pulled pork. It was good, and the portions were generous. The salad itself wasn't very exciting, but the bbq was good. I was so so on the bbq sauce, but tend to like it pretty sweet. Ordered a diet coke and it came in a plastic bottle, wasn't as good of course vs fountain as I had anticipated."}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing, Amazing. Brisket is ridiculous. My wife had the smoked salmon, it was also great. From California, so we had to try N Carolina BBQ and I'd say they make their state proud. Great BBQ sauces, and their mustard sauce is mouth watering good. They sell their rub and sauces, which I purchased, making this place a must. Our waitress, won't say her name for privacy, blonde curly hair is amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"Really good southern food! They have a southern twist to Nachos (pimento cheese, sooooo good) and pork tacos! There Mac and cheese is my favorite! I don't think you should go there for chicken. It's not that good to me, i perder just BBQ, or pork items. But the staff is very sweet and upbeat!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue, slaw, banana pudding, brisket in the Southeast! Why do you think President Obama ate there? He has good taste."}
{"text":"Still the best bbq in charlotte! The original location in plaza is the only one I go to. I call it...loyalty. Jk, I'm sure all the other locations now are legit too. It's awesome they have opened more...BECAUSE it's sooooo good. Yes that good!   I've liked everything I've tried there. But these are my go to favs that you must try:  Carolina pulled pork - their Midwood sauce is the. Best.  Baked Mac & cheese - yes please! Sweet potato fries! - I only share if I really love you.  AND. jalapeño bacon wrapped poppers. Yes.   I've also tried their creamed corn, prob the best around here for that, if you like corn. Like how is everything there this good?   They have a good selection of whisky. Com'on it's a bbq place! Also full bar. And lots of local brews. They got it all."}
{"text":"Great food! Try the beef brisket; it was awesome - great taste; they offer fatty, lean or both. The baked beans and hush puppies were also great; place was packed inside and outside. They also had a good selection of local beers"}
{"text":"Honestly, probably the best BBQ I've ever had and that's saying something. Having been to the top places in Texas, Missouri, and elsewhere this place is ever bit as good and then some. Pimento cheese fries and the Combo Sampler platter are definitely must-try's."}
{"text":"We ordered take out so I can not comment on the service. But the restaurant was packed when I went inside to pick up the food. The first thing I noticed was the smell, oh what a heavenly smell. The food was equally good. Very moist meat with perfect balance of spices. My favorite was the yellow mustard sauce, it was amazing. I swear it had cardamon in it, there was something Indian in that. I could drink that sauce, SO GOOD. Whenever I get that rare BBQ hankering I sometimes get, I will return and dine in."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! This is my first time here and good lord! Nothing has disappointed me!! The brisket and Mac & cheese are soooooo good and the waitress has never let us see the bottom of our glass!! 10/10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm not even going to try to piggy back on everything everyone has said... This place is da bomb. Come on Monday's for drink specials.   The best dish they have is their Sat/Sun Smoked Beef Rib. I'm going to say it's the best in Charlotte. Darn tasty.   (Drop Mic)"}
{"text":"I am a huge barbeque fan. I've visited the location in Huntersville and Plaza Midwood. I didn't give 5 stars because sometimes their staff is hit or miss. Other than that, they have great food! Kinda pricey, but it's good."}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ aficionado I like good BBQ, and I smoke my own. Not a fan of how they mix a eastern style sauce in with the pulled pork to keep from drying out,hush puppies were very good Mac and Cheese would not order again.A good pork BBQ will stand on its own. Service was awesome,restaurant was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar, and I received great service from the male bartender. He was courteous and professional. I also noticed that he checked to go orders for accuracy, prior to handing the food over to the customers. That is a commitment to excellent service.  Prices: Expensive. Figure on $25 per person without beer or cocktails. Yeah, I know that this is Charlotte, but I don't want to pay their rent.   Pulled Pork Barbecue Quality? Good, but slightly over-rated. Maybe the best in CLT though. I liked their burnt ends the best. B+  Décor: This is a cool restaurant, well laid out and inviting. I like the vibe and decor of this place.   Negatives: Parking in their minuscule parking lot is almost nonexistent. I guess that one could park across the road in the shopping center parking lot and dart across the busy traffic, but I'm too old to play \"dodge ball with vehicles.\"  PS: A confused waitress brought out my bacon wrapped jalapeno appetizer - well AFTER I received my entrée, and she tried to give it to other customers....not good. Many of the seeds were left in the jalapenos, so they were hella spicy, almost too spicy to eat. I left one on the plate.   I classify Midwood Smokehouse's fare as \"city\" barbecue or barbecue for those who don't know any better. Hey Midwood, don't despair, B+ from me on BBQ is pretty darned good. See my BBQ list for traditional BBQ restaurants in NC at 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"Plain and Simple, You Must Eat Here!! Stopped in for a late dinner after traveling in from Buffalo NY. Just a short wait time, place was busy. Our waiter, the food, drinks and atmosphere were all top notch."}
{"text":"This was a place recommended to us by a friend who travels to the area frequently. We did not regret it one bit! Service was excellent- all the meat was really great- expertly smoked. Now my only \"complaint\" was the pimento cheese fries- I wish there was MORE brisket! I'm biased because I love it lol. I wasn't in love with the pimento cheese- I know it's a local delicacy but I guess I don't have the palate for it. I also got the pulled pork sandwich with hush puppies! All excellent ! So filling!"}
{"text":"My first bbq in North Carolina and it didn't disappoint.  The brisket was a bit dry, which has been an unfortunate trend I've noticed, so I will stick to pulled pork and ribs from now on.  The pulled pork was fantastic and the sides (hush puppies and beans) were excellent."}
{"text":"Hey, I posted this on Google too, so hopefully I don't get dinged for that. Anyway, this is for the Johnston Rd. location --  Okay, so first and foremost the service was AMAZING. Our server, Melissa, outshined everything, even the food (which is darn near impossible in this spot.) She was so friendly, she brought us everything we didn't know we were gonna need and made spot on recommendations regarding the menu. Legit, even if the food wasn't great, I'd come back for her.  Luckily, the food is incredible and everything we ordered was unbelievable. Normally I would've driven to the Plaza Midwood location, but we were right around the corner and I am so glad we got a chance to check out this location because otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to meet Melissa!"}
{"text":"Ribs are my favorite, I read the reviews and was so happy to try these. The truth is they were not eatable. I hated them and no one in my family would eat them. Do not waste your money here.  They were not cooked right and the seasoning was flat out nasty."}
{"text":"I grew up near KC and am a brisket lover. This place was phenomenal to say the least. I actually made a noise of joy when I tried the baked beans!!  (No joke). The brisket and meal is easily the best BBQ in Charlotte. Great job team!!"}
{"text":"I love some good BBQ so I definitely had to stop here when I was passing by. We were seated immediately and the service was great. I ordered the pulled pork. The pork was good but their sauces were really the star here. Both were tasty. I'll be going back if I ever want some BBQ."}
{"text":"Midwood is my go to place in Charlotte for bbq. I've been to some of the other locations and this one was no different. I'm from Georgia where we do bbq slightly different than the Carolinas so I was happy to find a place that had great bbq here. We went on a busy Saturday night, but our wait was only around 10 minutes. This visit, I went with the brisket queso which was amazing. The brisket was tender and flavorful as always and the price is very reasonable. One big reason I also enjoy Midwood is their Mac n Cheese. Most places these days just give you noodles with some nasty cheese sauce on them, but Midwood actually provides baked mac n cheese the right way. There is also a large parking lot across the street which is nice so parking is a breeze. Midwood is always a good option."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse offers a wide range of barbecued (would this translate to \"cooked-out\" in the South?) goodness. Don't be fooled by the neon pigs on the sign, they faithfully prepare chopped chicken, turkey, and the best darn beef brisket ever to have graced my gullet in addition to the classic pulled pork, ribs, and sausage. These are all topped perfectly with amazing sweet, vinegar, and mustard -based bbq sauces. The vibrant flavors of the vinegar and mustard sauces have converted me away from the sweet sauces of my childhood.  While the menu is filled with a surprising array of sandwiches, salads, and sides, I've just stuck to their combo massive platters that comes with choice of 4 meats, 2 sides, hush puppies, and pickled onions. Enough to gastronomically stuff 2-3 people for $19? Now that is some gastro-nomics right there!  But wait, there is more! Did I mention the respectable local draft beers from the likes of OMB, Big Boss, and Four Friends? Plus 1/2 price on Mondays--an OMC Copper for $2.50?! I tip my bbq-stained hat at you sir!  Taken together, when visiting friends and family want to experience some local flavor, this place is on the short list."}
{"text":"How happy am I that Midwood has opened in Birkdale.  All I can say that it so good.  Started off with the Bacon Wrapped Jalapeños.  Always watch out because there is always one really hot one.   We call it Jalapeño  Roulette.    For the mains had the Pork Plate and the Brisket plate.  The small portion comes with one side and hush puppies.   Had the mac-n-cheese and collards.   Both were really good.    This is a BBQ staple for me as they have other locations around Charlotte.  Good to have one a few minutes from my house.   Will be here a lot!!!!   Praise the lard (yes lard) that Midwood is in HUNTERSVILLE."}
{"text":"This is such a good place.  They smoke their meats on premise and do a great job.  Never had a bad meal.   Pulled Pork, Brisket and the Wings are all good choices.  The Bacon Wrapped Jalapeños are a great start.   Creamed Corn,  Collards and MacNCheese are all great sides."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Midwood Smokehouse! I stumbled across this place when I couldn't decide what to eat, and I was not disappointed. It is rare to find juicy well seasoned brisket this side of Texas, but they knocked I think out of the park. The sausage...delicious. the smoked chicken...delicious. The smokey Jalepeno poppers...FREEKIN DELICIOUS   *I SERIOUSLY LIMIT MYSELF TO 3 MEALS THERE PER YEAR*"}
{"text":"Ordered take out once again for me, my wife and her sister, it was great we got all of our food and plenty of it! The nice take out lady double checked our order and realized something was off, so when I was sent on my way everyone enjoyed all there food and the smoked flavor is ALWAYS so amazing and it's unlike any other smokehouse I have visited in Charlotte"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and very cool.  Abigail served us and she was awesome.  Great server.  We had ribs which were good but would like just a little more tender.  Not falling off the bone tender.  That's too much.  I like my ribs to have a little bite.  Willing to try them again though.  Chicken was awesome.  Beans out of this world.  Red slaw pretty good.  Greens awesome.  Bacon wrapped jalapeño good but would like bacon crispier.  Hush puppies awesome.  Banana pudding really good.  Pecan cobbler.  Oh my.  Sooooo good.  Going back there try burnt ends and Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I visited this place based on the yelp reviews  Y'ALL TRICKED ME highly disappointed after at 30 minute wait for a simple BBQ sandwich.  The bbq was more like smoked pork with no flavor. I felt as I'd they made my sandwich from left over meat from 3 Days ago.    I had to pour on the extra sauce to keep from choking off the thick dry bun.  Eeeewww"}
{"text":"I am ruined for BBQ. I will never eat BBQ at another restaurant in this city. The pimento cheese fries are a must. Also be a fat kid and order a side of the baked beans and dump those bad boys on there. Do it. For real. I would start listing things that are good here but I would start at the planter near the door. I love it all. Eat here as soon as possible if you haven't already. Burnt ends are a must for first timers."}
{"text":"I just ordered their new salad with smoked chicken and it was amazing. My waitress kathy was awesome, very personable and knows customer service. I will definitely be back cause of her, if you go here you must request kathy krooz is her full name.   If i owned a restaurant she would come work for me."}
{"text":"I was traveling in Charlotte for work and decided to get some Carolina BBQ. I found this place and wow it was great. I had the burnt ends ( always my favorite) and the were fantastic. With Mac and cheese and greens . The service was great. Even the host who sat me was funny and friendly. My server was attentive but not overly. My drink was her suggestion and was wonderful. I took the pecan cobbler back to my hotel for a late night snack and it was the best I had ever had , my only complaint was that my to go cobbler didn't have utensils which made it challenging in the hotel . Eat here!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Still love Midwood...might be my favorite place for brisket in Charlotte! Last trip we got the 4 meat platter - tried their smoked turkey, ribs and brisket times 2 (lean all the way). For sides we had the mac & cheese and smoked veggies.   Everything was DELISH! And our service was great too. I really like this place and definitely recommend it to someone looking for the best bbq in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been in a Barbecue mood lately, so when some co-workers wanted to grab a casual dinner, I suggested we try Midwood Smokehouse's latest location in Birkdale Village. It was perfect for our group. Awesome local beer selection and plenty of options for everyone to get as little or as much food as they liked. I went with the small Brisket (with lean cuts) which came with 1 side. I also added a smoked sausage because I find them to be amazing at barbecue spots and I was pretty hungry.   The brisket portion was PERFECT. So juicy and flavorful. The plate came with 5 hush puppies, some pickled onions, plus my side of smoked veggies. The sausage had a great snap and came with some house ground mustard, an excellent touch. I would order this again and again.   Service was fast and friendly. GREAT addition to Birkdale!"}
{"text":"As far as barbecue places go in Charlotte, Midwood barbecue by far THE best brisket in town.  In no way is this place fancy. In fact, they might even let you in with your pajamas. Service is always great and every staff member I've interacted with there has been friendly. Even the person managing the takeout orders is nice!  But let's get down to business. The food here is fantastic. They do a great Texas style brisket, which I highly recommend. If I'm feeling in a light mood, I will get the chopped salad and add brisket on top. It's delicious. Sides are great, and I would recommend the Mac and cheese. I know this is kind of random, but the sausage is really good too. It's one of those meets that comes as an afterthought to a lot of people, but put this at the top of the order next you go!  All in all, a great BBQ joint. Patio is nice in the spring and they turn tables fairly quickly so you do t have to wait too long. If I could leave you with one piece of advice, get the bacon wrapped jalapeños. You won't regret the taste and you can just ignore the calories."}
{"text":"Food is really good! Very wide variety to choose from! Try the BBQ spaghetti!!! Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Quality food and drinks.  Hefty portion sizes.  Excellent prices.  Great decor.  Cons: Waitstaff becomes pushy nearing closing time."}
{"text":"Got off the plane late and wandering around looking for dinner. Just happened on this. Wow! Amazing food. My son got burnt bits and I got the brisket - amazing food. Amazing service, friendly and helpful. Good collection of beer. And open late too."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot of great things about this place, and I am sorry to say that it did not live up to expectations.  The portions were small, the taste was okay but nothing exceptional. The service was lackluster at best. Too many other really good places to eat BBQ to make a special trip here again, at least for us."}
{"text":"I had a good salad and my husband had the brisket along with creamed corn. I liked the hush puppies! I also ordered the banana pudding. The picture of The SMALL salad shows that it's really not that small!"}
{"text":"I spent two weeks in Charlotte and during that time, I visited four BBQ joints (well, three plus Boardwalk Billy's, which is BBQ in name only). Midwood was definitely the winner.  Midwood had an extensive BBQ selection, including burnt ends. Here's a tip: If you go to a BBQ joint that offers burnt ends, you know you're at a legit smoke shop. I ordered the full rack of ribs and added a side of burnt ends. My ribs also came with BBQ slaw and bacon-wrapped jalapenos. The ribs were amazing. Perfect amount of smoke. The meat came off the bone with almost no effort, but they weren't \"fall off the bone\" (which is great because really, who wants their rib meat to fall off into their lap or onto the plate?). This place also caters to the gluten-free crowd with a dedicated gluten-free menu. Even the bacon-wrapped jalapenos were gluten free as they were not breaded!  The burnt ends were delicious. I treated them as an extra appetizer. They easily could have been a meal.  I can't imagine any BBQ restaurant in Charlotte being better than Midwood. The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our waitress also gladly did individual checks for all 8 of us without adding a gratuity. It probably worked out to her advantage that there wasn't a mandatory 18% gratuity, as I know my table far exceeded that.  Hands down, the best meal I had during my two weeks in Charlotte"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I'm from Texas, where BBQ is a religion. This heavily influences my review.    The BBQ here is actually quite good.  I ordered burnt ends, which I haven't found yet at any BBQ joint. They were quite good, but came six to an order, with a side and a few hush puppies for $12.50.  I'd estimate, you are getting 6 oz. of brisket for that price, which is insane.  I could buy 6 oz. of filet minion for less.   BBQ naturally uses cheaper cuts of meat..which is why they long cooking process. It should be cheap and quick and plentiful.  This was none of that.  I waited for nearly a half hour, which was made a bearable thanks to a large selection of draft beer.   Since many of the N. Carolina BBQ restaurants I've been to offer signature Mac-n-cheese, I ordered that as my side.  Just like every other N. Carolina BBQ restaurant whose Mac-n-cheese I've eaten, this is nothing special.   Hush puppies here are actually better than anywhere else I've had them in N. Carolina.  In Texas, you only get hush puppies with sea food, but here they are served with everything.  Generally, they are bland and frozen...but I think these are fresh.  I don't know why more places don't make their hush puppies fresh, since corn bread batter is probably the cheapest and easiest thing to fry.  Another big plus for offering one of my favorite things in the entire world, bacon-wrapped jalapeno.  Where I come from, these are a staple of any cookout, but rare to find in a restaurant.    I will go back to Midwood Smokehouse, but I doubt I become a regular."}
{"text":"Great bbq place! Everything we got was great- salmon, brisket, and brisket burnt ends. The brisket was especially good and I would recommend ordering extra hush puppies if you like them. Some come with the meal, but just a handful and they're small."}
{"text":"Coming from Central Texas, I miss Texas style BBQ and this comes close!  Sides are delicious, brisket is very good, nice smoky flavor, you can get either fatty or lean.  Sausage was good as well.  Not bad for NC take on Texas barbecue!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ place. Real smoking, true to form. Maybe the best ribs I have ever had. Perfect service. Jess is on top of it. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff!  Was disappointed with a meal at another area BBQ restaurant. Midtown more than made up for it!  Sausage was decent. Pulled pork was flavorful and moist. I enjoyed the collard greens, although being a Northerner, I'm never really sure what these should taste like.   Baked beans were fantastic. (I am a literal baked bean expert, so I do not say such things lightly.). Beans were cooked properly, not soft or mushy, and tasted great in the spicy sauce.   Ribs were excellent. Tender and sweetly sauced.   Brisket was melt in your mouth tender. Server even asked if I wanted the lean or marbled portion. I took the marbled, and it tasted great. Bark was very spicy, which suited me fine, but may be a bit much for some.   Doubt I'll ever be in Charlotte again, but if I am, I'll be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ experience I have had next to Franklin's brisket in ATX! And from top to bottom it may surpassed it with its sides. The burnt ends is phenomenal, the pulled pork and pulled chicken are smoked to perfection where it's dry because of the smoke but flavorful and not dried out. The St. Louis Ribs are literally fall off the bone and the dry rub is so good it needs no sauce. The brisket is actually Texas style brisket and is better than some place in Texas. Their sauces are really good as well and I didn't do the vinegar sauce because I'm not a vinegar guy, but their house BBQ sauce and the Habanero version is good. Their BBQ beans are legit and has meat in it. Their other sides were delicious according to my colleagues. And our server Wil was very hospitable and provided great real recommendations and great service. But if you are in Charlotte and you are going to eat... EAT here!"}
{"text":"Great Father's Day Service. Christie is awesome. He truly enjoyed his Father's Day. Full rack of ribs for him with the Sunday special Bloody Mary. Brisket for me (not pictured)...always fatty."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were from out of town and this place had the best reviews, so we thought why not. We had the queso and beef brisket, it was amazing. My fiancé had the Texas hash which is their Sunday special. The Texas hash had fried onions, pepper, fried eggs, Texas toast, brisket and avocado. The Texas hash was packed with flavor, the brisket itself was really flavorful in it. I had the half rack of ribs. The ribs were out of this world they offered two different sauces for the ribs, one was a  habanero bbq sauce and then a sweeter tomato bbq sauce it was hard to choose which one they were both really good. For sides we tried the coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and bbq baked beans. However, I would not recommend the Mac and cheese, very plain and didn't really have flavor the noodles were also tough. However, the baked beans were really good. Then we also tried the banana pudding, it was only 2.50. It was amazing, don't forget to try that.  I wish I remembered our waitresses name, but she was really friendly and went out of her way to explain everything to us considering it was our first time. Highly recommend this place. Will come back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Damn. What a sweet place to get some BBQ. Today was my first visit. I ordered a chicken BBQ small plate with mustard sauce which comes with hushpups and one side, and I chose Bacon-wrapped Jalapeños, which r00led hard. Got myself the $3 beer of the month which was New Belgium Fat Tire. Yum. What a delicious meal.   My vegetarian lady friend got the Black bean burger and that tasted great plus creamed corn. Nom.   The meal was cooked extremely quickly so that was great.  Excellent food overall, I'll definitely be back to try something new.  Mac's has a run for its money."}
{"text":"This new location is a just a shadow of the original. It lacks a lot of the things that make the original location great. The character of the Plaza Midwood location is gone, and this location feels like any chain place in the area.   While the food was pretty good, my wife and I had a generally bad service experience. Our waitress was far from attentive, so ordering and getting refills was a tedious process. The worst thing came hidden in our chips and queso: random nasty, burned pieces of fryer garbage were strewn throughout our chips. Apparently general kitchen cleanliness is an issue at this location. Worse yet, when we brought the issue up to our waitress, she barely apologized and didn't comp it at all.   Overall, I won't be back to this location, even if I'm in the area. There are too many food choices in Charlotte to settle for mediocrity."}
{"text":"My hunt for the best barbecue in Charlotte has come to an end. I came to Midwood Smokehouse with my wife and the in-laws last weekend, and we were all wowed. We ordered   Right away, I was pleased by the drink and beer selection. There are a lot of local brews available, and there are more than just the usual suspects. As far as the food menu went, it was really, really hard to make a choice. Everything sounds and looks terrific. I went with the burnt ends with hush puppies and mac and cheese, which were all fantastic. My table also had a sampler platter, which included pulled pork, some sides, and some wings. My mother-in-law got a salad; I didn't try it, but she loved it.   I really don't think you can go wrong here. Now that I've tried the BBQ staples, I'm excited to try some of their more inventive options on the menu. There's a lot on the menu to explore, and I'm looking forward to the journey."}
{"text":"If you're wanting something close to Texas food (I said \"close to it\" because aint nothing like Texas! Lol), this is the place to go. My husband & I went & got the combo platter full-fed plate for both of us. It came with hush puppies, pickles onion, fries, cream corn, & 4 4-8 oz. of your protein ... we asked for 3 sides of lean brisket, & 1 of hickory smoked sausage.   Sausage has cheese inside so i personally didn't like it but my husband did.   The cream corn, the closest thing i can describe it to you is if you've ever been to Bill Millers Its Kinda the same as their sweet corn but it has a little twist to it because they put pieces of jalapeños here & the corn is also a little tooo soft. But still good."}
{"text":"Place was great, classy, and Mac and cheese was on point. Brisket is what you should obviously get"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the place after my ex's parents took me there because they absolutely loved the peach cobbler there. I had the ribs and they were perfect, falling off the bone and excellent BBQ sauce. My ex had the chicken sandwich and I fell in love with their mustard BBQ sauce. The only thing I didn't really like was the Mac & Cheese, I didn't like the spiral noodles it seemed like they were not fully cooked, and it lacked flavor. But all in all I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I'm not big on BBQ but my boyfriend is and we both loved this place! Our server, Drew, was awesome.  He was incredibly helpful and friendly.   Agree with all of the other post that recommend the bacon wrapped jalapeños and also the brisket and ribs.  All of the meat we had was cooked perfectly and delicious. Highly suggest trying this place! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing BBQ place. Went for first time yesterday.  The burnt ends were the best. Bloody Mary's were watery IMO.  Brisket and coleslaw was great.  Not a huge fan of the collards.  Great place and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sunday night at 8:00 pm and place was packed.  Good sign.   Great vibe. Reminds me of great joints in Austin. Nothing in KC has this kind of vibe. Good rock music. 70s 80s. Classic Sammy Haggar.  Manager was an awesome guy.   Very limited parking.   Great beer selection.   Good service. Beers promptly refilled.   Fatty brisket was amazing. Could pull it apart with a fork. Not a lot of flavor from the bark. Definitely not a salt /pepper rub.   Sausage was fantastic.  Hard to explain vs traditional BBQ joint sausage.  Amazing with the brown mustard.   Pulled chicken was amazing. Loads of flavor and very juicy and tender.  Pulled and dressed with the vinegar-based sauce.   Pork didn't overwhelm me.  That was the one thing I was expecting to be good.   They were out of the St. Louis style BBQ ribs. :(  I'm giving the food 3 stars and the atmosphere takes it to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Some of the best barbecue I've ever had. The North Carolina vinegar sauce was perfect, and the smoke on the pork was so flavorful! The sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese and creamed corn were tops, but the hush puppies and cole slaw weren't great.  Good prices, nice atmosphere, cheap beer. Overpriced cocktails and my personal disappointment in my slaw kept me from rating this 5 stars, but I would definitely go back. Great place."}
{"text":"As a resident on Plaza-Midwood, this place must be in the top 3 of my favorites.  It gets crowded very quickly, especially on the weekends.  I am a huge BBQ fan and I have made the switch from my previous preference tomato based sauces to now a vinegar based sauce.  I do, however, from time to time get the habanero BBQ sauce which is awesome and has a nice kick!  The brisket is starting to become a favorite of mine but you definitely cannot go wrong with their pulled pork.  I am a sucker for the queso app with a little meat mixed in.  PBR is very cheap and I am all about it at this place.  Parking is scarce but you can definitely find a place across the street and across from the new apartments.  I usually get a sneaky take out when my wife works late but that is all screwed up since she will see this.  Midwood Smokehouse is a must go to spot if you are in the area and want some good BBQ.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"This barbecue place is awesome! Great ribs that fall off the bone, great bourbon, atmosphere, and music. Can't be beat and highly recommend their bacon wrapped jalapeños."}
{"text":"I've been seeking a good spot for southern dishes and decided to give this place a go based on Yelp rating.  I got the Carolina pork platter with a side of mac n cheese and BBQ baked beans.  Very filling.  Probably would have tasted better if I ate right away.  The baked beans were my favorite.  Very flavorful although a tad salty.  Very much like a bushes baked beans but probably better.  The mustard bbq sauce reminded me so much of Maurice's BBQ Mustard that I grew up on when we had Sunday dinner but they have it spicy.  I may return but not floored.  Oh yeah pick up for orders are on the opposite side of the wall at the bar. How stupid to not even get acknowledged standing between the bar's doorway?..."}
{"text":"Hey don't let the 3 stars get you wrong. This place was great. The service was attentive and helpful. The ambiance is amusing and the soundtrack was classic. I had the combo plater with brisket, smoked turkey, sausage and pulled pork with coleslaw and bacon wrapped poppers. Yes, I will be checking into the nearest hospital for the impending heart attack.  The sauces are served on the side in small dipping cups. I prefer squirt bottles to having to ask for more BBQ sauce (I like lots of BBQ). The turkey was great as well as the pork and sausage. Here is the 'but', the brisket was served with the grizzle still attached. Ok maybe that's just how they serve it here. The problem with this is the fat out weighed the beef. It broke away nicely but I barely was able to enjoy the tender meat before it was gone. Concluding, I had a good meal with only one gripe. Enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"Swung by this place for a protein rich snack after church on Sunday. The place has that rustic feel to  it that you would expect at a BBQ joint, and there is a quaint little patio area outside for dining as well.   My fiancé suggested the smoked wings, and Midwood Smokehouse didn't disappoint! The wings were smokey and actually seasoned very well without the seasoning being overbearing. The sauce was great, but it honestly wasn't required.   Our waiter was Zach, and although we only ordered two sets of wings and a Bloody Mary, he treated us as though we had a $150 tab. We interacted with several over staff members during our stay that were extremely pleasant as well.   I would recommend this location if you had a choice !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My wife and I had an hour or two to kill in Charlotte so we stopped in for lunch. Great beer selection and a simple menu. I had the pulled pork plate with bacon wrapped jalapeños and I couldn't have been more happy.  I lived in Charlotte for about a year and was always fond of the Thomas st area. There is a lot going on here. I would definitely recommend stopping in here if you are up for some great wood smoked BBQ!"}
{"text":"This food is absolutely phenomenal!  I first visited this place a few years ago after reading an article in the NY Times (\"36 Hours in Charlotte, NC -- http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-charlotte-nc.html?_r=0) and have been back several times since.  My favorite things to order are... - BBQ Queso (app) - Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos (app or side) - Classic Mac & Cheese (side) - Dry Rubbed Ribs (entree) - Well Fed Combo Platter (entree for 2) - Stockyard taco (entree)  The restaurant itself can get a little crowded.  Go early to avoid a long wait.  Outdoor seating (on a covered and climate-controlled patio) is available and is what I prefer.  Parking can be a little cumbersome.  The original restaurant is in Plaza Midwood.  They have since expanded to Ballantyne and have plans to expand in Park Rd. Shopping Center."}
{"text":"I read an article that said this place had great BBQ before visiting Charlotte so I thought I would give it a try!   The place  This is their new location that opened not too long ago.  It was your average chain looking place plenty of parking and nice on the inside but nothing special.  Very clean which is a big plus with me.   The food  I ordered the ribs and they were good but nothing special.  I was really hoping for better but they were nothing to write home about.  I heard that the original place is better so maybe next time I will try their other location. My sides again were solid but nothing special.  The service We had a group of 10 and our waitress was great she was very kind and attentive.    The verdict  I really had high hopes since reading this place had great BBQ since it is my favorite type of food.  I was disappointed when it was nothing great.  I would come here again but don't except anything above the average chain."}
{"text":"Arrived into town 6/25 and didn't know where to go for lunch. We decided on BBQ and headed to Midwood Smokehouse and were seated outside. We had burnt ends and pulled chicken with very crispy sweet potato fries. It was delicious!!! The mustard sauce that came with the chicken was tasty and different. BBQ sauce that was brought to the table was perfection. Coleslaw was a nice way to cool some of the spicy food down. Our ice teas with firefly vodka were spot on! Our waiter, dark brown beard and hair, was very informative about the menu and town. Service was great! Definitely returning to eat here next time in town."}
{"text":"Got the combo platter. I'd rate: 1. Fatty brisket 2. Smoked sausage 3/4 pork or chicken depending on my mood.  Try the bacon wrapped jalapeños."}
{"text":"There is no questions about, THIS IS THE BEST BBQ IN CHARLOTTE!  We came over here for a family lunch and we have ordered the 4 meats plate with sides. Everything was absolutely fantastic! The ribs are probably the best ones I have ever had. I have ordered the hush puppies but they never came, so, I can't rate those.  Anyway, if this place wasn't too far from my home (I live at Lake Norman) I would come here a lot more often."}
{"text":"Oh Midwood, how I love thee. This was the first place my husband and I ate in Charlotte when we decided to move here a few months ago. We had sat at the bar, ordered way too much food, and left happy and stuffed. We ended up moving very close by, so now it's a place we've been visiting about once a week. The staff is so friendly here and the service is great. Whether you sit at the bar, in the dining room, or on the nice patio, it's a relaxing place to have a meal.   We love their nachos with brisket on top, and also the cheese fries with brisket on top. Really, just give me brisket on top of anything and I'm good to go. We often split the pork plate. The pork melts in your mouth and has great flavor, and they also have a lot of great BBQ sauces to put on it. I love their hushpuppies, which are always fresh, and we're also big fans of the mac and cheese, collard greens, and baked beans. The pork plate is so huge we often have leftovers that we heat up with breakfast the next morning, and it's just as good. In general their portions are very large for the price. We always have leftovers, even when we try not to order too much.   Midwood also does take out really well. We ordered their smoked wings, a brisket quesadilla, and pork plate to go, and it was all packed so nicely. The brisket quesadilla is so, so good, so I'd highly recommend that whether you want it as a meal or need a snack to share.   Their banana pudding is also delicious, and they have a lot of great beers on tap including a \"big size\" that my husband beelines for whenever we dine in. They also have great cocktails, which I really didn't expect. I recently had a bourbon/mint/thyme drink that was delicious. There's so many other delicious things on the menu that we have to come back for, especially the ribs. If you're looking for a casual but nice dining experience and great BBQ, check out Midwood."}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue, probably the best in Charlotte. Tons of beer on tap (17 i think) including Red Oak which is awesome. Staff was friendly and good even when they were clearly in the weeds."}
{"text":"Man oh man! Bit my fingers twice eating this loveliness! I went with a platter and was not disappointed. Everything was great, atmosphere, food, drinks and service.   I especially liked the non lean brisket and chicken wings. My daughter raved about the red neck tacos. I'd move from DC to Charlotte to sample this every week, 10 stars!!!"}
{"text":"sometimes the service is THE WORST. but, I have dreams about the chopped salad with chicken. SO GOOD. take it from this Memphis girl, this is probably the only BBQ place in NC I will eat."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Manager came by several times to check on us. Our server Gary was on point and super accommodating. Highly recommend this new location, it's good and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Yep...that's it, this place makes it all the way up to my #1 spot for Q.  Finally had the pleasure of giving it a try the other night and dined on some absolutely delicious beef brisket.  Brisket is a pretty tricky thing because it can dry easily and become very chewy, etc.  This on the other hand was falling apart it was so juicy and tender.  Prior to stuffing my face with the brisket I enjoyed some jalapeño peppers wrapped in bacon...good lord!  The temperature will sneak up on you so be careful but the taste is oh so good.  Great beer selections and a cozy neighborhood restaurant feel really seal the deal for me.  I'll be back.....OFTEN :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. Try he burnt ends and fried jalapeños, but don't you dare miss their juicy, perfectly prepared burgers.   I have dreams about them!"}
{"text":"This is where you wanna go for BBQ in the QC but go early though cause they run out fast. Just evidence of how good it is."}
{"text":"Midwood was awesome!! I had the beef brisket with smoked vegetables...I'm not a barbeque fan but I really enjoyed it. Service was great"}
{"text":"Some of the menu items were definitely hit or miss. One of my biggest complaints when going to a restaurant (because I used to be a chef) is bringing out cold or just warm food. I would have given this restaurant a clean four stars for environment, food, and customer service. The bartenders were very friendly and attentive when it came to checking on us and meeting our needs and requests as customers. But the food (entire platter was lukewarm at best.)  Coming all the way from Baltimore to try charlotte's famous Carolina BBQ, serving warm meat at a BBQ spot is totally uncalled for. Regardless, neat location to dine grab a beer and watch football. It don't really have that BWW feel for a sports bar but it's a nice adjustment for decent BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is great, plan to wait, it's worth it! The pulled pork was tender, moist, and just enough bark for flavor. I recommend the house sauce, has an. Nice little smokey taste to it. BBQ beans were great too, another had the brisket, said it was great too. We left full and happy, it's a bit loud, but a great time had by all."}
{"text":"Good service and good basic BBQ but nothing out of this world.  I had burnt ends, which were good.  Good draft beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm in South Carolina and I wanted barbecue! So I looked around and came across this place. There's nothing fancy about this place, just straight up Western \"looking\" atmosphere with lots of wood everywhere and smug paintings on the wall. Thursdays are 1/2 off wine bottles so you know I got one of them! When I come to barbecue places or smokehouse restaurants I ALWAYS get the combo! So here I got the \"Well Fed\" portion of chopped pork, beef brisket, chopped chicken and hickory smoked sausage. I had macaroni & cheese and steamed vegetables as my sides. Everything was amazing. Fresh, tender, full of flavor, hot and just good. I will certainly come back here to feast!"}
{"text":"Best ribs in Charlotte BAR NONE, their reputation speaks for themselves but it's no contest hands down best ribs in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went to Midwood Smokehouse on a Monday which was excellent because they have North Carolina draft beers for 1/2 price!  We drank great beer for a super low price.  I had the chicken sandwich with mustard sauce which was great, and a side of mac & cheese, also great!  I tried a bite of my friends pork sandwich with the vinegar sauce and loved it.  I also asked for a side of the Midwood sauce to try and dip the crinkle cut french fries in and was very impressed!  The coleslaw was chopped up very fine and very flavorful.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  The prices are very reasonable.  A couple of downsides, unfortunately they didn't have any ribs yet available for us to try.  All the more reason to go back on a Monday and enjoy those $2.50 beers!  Also the hostess seemed very flustered and told us our table would take at least 15-20 minutes when in fact we waited for less than 5.  Luckily we didn't believe her first assessment since there was no one else waiting or we might have left....  Would be disappointing to lose customers because of this!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is YUM!!! THE BURNT ENDS ARE AMAZING !! It is so tough to find BURNT ENDS that are done right and these guys know how to do it!! Thank you for awesome food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Live in Kansas City, and the Fat Tire BBQ sauce here is hands down my favorite!!! Casual, nice outside patio."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious. Recommended to come here by the hotel guest service manager. Pulled Pork is to good for it's own good. Portions are good all around. Get the baked beans and the smoked wings. Come ready to eat here. Great service on top of the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Yum, glad I looked on Yelp.  Milwood Smokehouse was fantastic.  Ate the sampler and it was worth every bite.  Left no morsel behind.  Always looking for great BBQ and everything was spot on tonight.  Yes Mac and cheese and yes on the bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers.  Also great friendly service.  How many local beers?  Great selection just bring me one.   Will be returning."}
{"text":"Arrived just before the dinner rush apparently, although there were still quite a few people. Got sat, got our food in a very timely manner and the food was great. Great service and environment."}
{"text":"This place makes me proud to be an American...  Good manhattans, great IPAs.  BBQ so good you'll want to slap your Grandma...  Hight level cleanliness.  Encountered staff in the restroom that did three cycle hand wash.  I thought he was getting ready for surgery...  Wait staff was very helpful in determining how to set up My first order to best experience the offering.    Try the cuban, ribs and wings.  You wont be disappointed!  A true piece of Americana...  love it"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse claims to be Eastern NC Style Barbeque. I know not. I had their Barbeque Sandwich, this evening and was not impressed. Though it was my first visit, I was expecting, at least a mediocre sandwich, at best. What I first discovered, was a bread sandwich, with a small amount of pork barbeque, atop a 4\" bun. The barbeque tasted less than mediocre.  True Eastern NC Barbeque is from the WHOLE HOG, not from butts and/or shoulders. I don't mind paying $8 for a great sandwich; but one that was so disappointing as this one was, I wouldn't pay $4 for it. Also, the crinkle-cut fries were cold. You'd think that for $8, they'd cut fresh taters and fry them. I suggest doing your homework about NC Style Barbeque. Seasoned Apple-Cider Vinegar is used and it's Chopped."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in CLT!  I have eaten at the Ballantyne location a few times and it never disappoints.  I have eaten at the Plaza Midwood location many times and it is excellent as well  I have had the Burt ends as well as the pulled pork sandwich.  Both are great. I highly recommend the stuffed jalapeños - they are awesome.  If you are looking for great BBQ then try this place"}
{"text":"Yelp helped us find this place and --whoooo boy, were we in for a treat!  Ordered the 4 meat + 2 side platter.  All the meats were great.  All the sauces, too.  But here's why I really appreciated Smokehouse and gave you 5 stars.  The coleslaw and hush puppies were fresh, delicious and had some thought behind them.  I feel like with lots of BBQ places they spend so much time on the meat that the sides and (god forbid!) the hush puppies are a ho-hum afterthought.  Not so here.  Bravo.  --Oh wait, but I didn't give you 5 stars and here's why...  The reason you don't get 5 stars from me is because of the kid's food.  We ordered chicken fingers and mac-n-cheese for our 3 year old.  My food philosophy with kids is that they are basically small adults and shouldn't be coddled to with garbage, dumbed-down, obviously-from-a-bag chicken fingers.  You guys clearly respect meat so how's about making something good for the kiddos? --Something less spicy and less seasoned than the grown up choices but still actual good food...not frozen junk."}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty. From previous reviews and recent rank from \"BOB\" Barbecue in Charlotte, it didn't disappoint.  I ordered the Burnt Ends with Mac N Cheese, hubby got a Pulled Pork sandwich and fries, kids got Grilled Cheese and Apples. I also got a container of Sweet Potatoes fries (I can't turn those away.). Everything was above par for a BBQ joint. Burnt Ends had a lot of sauce on them which made it a little underwhelming.  However,  the Mac n Cheese and Sweet Potatoes Fries made up for it. Grilled Cheese and regular fries were average. Hubby's Pulled Pork sandwich looked amazing. I didn't try it but it looked really tasty.   Only bummer was there's no drink specials on Saturdays. But a bottle of Johnny Appleseed was only $4! We would definitely go back at least for additional drink specials during the week. Plus I need to try the Pulled Pork Sandwich."}
{"text":"The food used to be great when they first opened their Ballantyne location. I thought I would not miss Sticky Fingers.  But now?? OMG! I ordered their $24 combo platter (because that is the most cost effective way to have two types of meats, they make you order FOUR and spend $24!). I only ate less than half of the food. It wasn't great tasting. THEN an hour later - let's just say I got SICK and spent the next hour in the bathroom. I'll NEVER be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location. Service is the main issue. I ordered the small chopped salad & a brisket sandwich. My wife had the pork sandwich. The salad came out with my sandwich & had the wrong dressing with it. I sent the salad back because of the timing. My wife liked her sandwich. The waitress asked if she was finished before she was finished. She then presented the check & had to take it back because my wife wanted the banana pudding. She described the BP as cake, banana & whipped cream:(  P.S. What's with the blaring hard rock music...country would be so much more appropriate."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter where in the country you are from, and that's including all of those proclaimed bbq capitals of the world, this is as good as it gets!!  Midwood knows smoked meats and absolutely slams side dishes!  Having visited more than this location, I can attest to the fact that they're consistent at any location.  Their smoked wings are just incredible, and without a doubt, are just the best I've ever had anywhere!  The smoked pulled pork and beef brisket or just as tender as can be and so full of flavor that I personally do not even have to add their house made sauce! The beef brisket salad is out of this world, and when combined with their avocado cream dressing, is just heavenly! From their Mack and cheese, to their barbecue baked beans, and their bacon wrapped jalapeños, their sides are a winner no matter what you decide to choose! I have to also add that the staff at this location was just as friendly and helpful as it's been at other locations!  Midwood is the place for smoked meats!"}
{"text":"What have you been smoking if you haven't given Midwood Smokehouse a minimum of four, but perhaps even a five star rating? I knew the Charlotte area had some great BBQ places, even had a couple of go-to's myself. Well, I thought I did! Until today, March 25th, I realized that I hadn't experienced the area's best BBQ! Midwood does it all and does it well! From the start you notice every server with a upbeat, charming, and eager to get you anything kinda attitude! Mine, Lorilee, was incredibly prompt, charming, and personable! From the time the Smoked Wings hit the table I knew this was special! Ordered dry with sauce on the side, these wings were smokey, plump, juicy, and the best wings in Charlotte hands down! To not feel too guilty, I ordered the Brisket Salad which made me feel ridiculously guilty! Full of tender brisket, smokey corn, real bacon, black beans, avocado, fresh lettuce, and fresh tomatoes! Incredibly good it was indeed! Then came the small Pulled Pork platter which had more meat than I'd first thought. Tender, juicy, flavorful, and though tossed in Eastern sauce it didn't disappoint. The side of Baked Beans had some pulled pork, possible bacon, and perhaps burnt ends in it which made it the highlight of the meal. Yes a side item stole the show which should tell you that they aren't just concentrating on the meats! I regret that I'll never step foot in my two favorites in Charlotte again, but hey, step up to Midwood's game!"}
{"text":"Great experience! I had the Carolina pork, bacon wrapped jalapeños, and smoked veggies. I didn't care for the veggies because they were a little bland, so I got the collard greens instead and they were amazing. We also had the BBQ queso which I added brisket, jalapeños, and barbecue sauce to and it was awesome. The food was delicious and our server Jessica took great care of us. I told her I like sauces and she brought me every single sauce the place has to offer and packed them all to go. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There was no wait on a Wednesday night.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Ribs, Smoked Chicken, collards and Mac & cheese.  The meats were all tender, ribs were the star, everything else was decent."}
{"text":"Had an (unusual) craving for BBQ and decided to try Midwood Smokehouse. Parking lot was full at 12:30, as were the bar and restaurant. Did a ToGo order of a half rack of ribs w.crispy fries as my side. Got in my car, opened the fries to have a few, but they were so good I ate a little more than a few! Tawny golden, thinner then usual crinkle cuts which actually came as a full side, in it's own separate container (yay!). The hefty Texas style ribs were smokey, very moist, topped with a smear of a tomato-based, sweet & savory sauce and fell-off-the bone! Look at how much meat was on them! I only ate 2! Hush puppies, a side of BBQ sauce and slivers of sweet onion also come with the meal. This is the best BBQ I have ever eaten! This gem is somewhat hidden so I forget it's there, but not anymore! I'll go back to try other food, bc the dishes coming out of the kitchen looked scrumptious! Even better, the staff was courteous, friendly and very well trained. $15 well spent!"}
{"text":"the food is good no excellent. But what is more remarkable is that they have gluten free options. No I can't eat everything but what I can eat is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one Sunday the atmosphere was very nice and enjoyable the food was good as well I just wish the barbecue sauce was thicker"}
{"text":"Subpar food but the service is the worst. Waited a hour and 10 on food I know it's a busy Friday night but they don't have it together at all"}
{"text":"I crave these smoked wings all the time. They are juicy and delicious! Fantastic people watching very fun atmosphere and good drink specials! My husband had the bbq pot roast once ( I normally do not like pot roast) and it was absolutely amazing so much flavor and just yum!"}
{"text":"So I had high hopes for this place. My experience was absolutely atrocious.   First my waiter Brian wasn't the best. He was friendly but he seemed complacent in the fact that he didn't need to really need to deal with us.   Second, when I received my order. I ordered lean brisket. It was more than 1/2 fat. They take it back and bring it back within a minute telling me yes this is lean brisket... well I had another waitress come over (who she was a doll. I wish I caught her name but she did great) and check up on us. Well I asked her and she didn't seem to sure that it was the lean brisket. In fact both waiters had said it wasn't lean when they looked at it.   So the manager comes over. He is very dismissive. Explaining lean has a sliver of fat. Well yes I understand that, so why is my brisket more than half fat on each piece? Explain this.   He takes my plate back, only cuts off the fat. Doesn't even give me new pieces, bother fixing up my plate nothing. So two times my plate was taken to the back and brought back as if they didn't give a shit.  And to top it off we also ordered brisket queso... yes you guessed it, most of the \"brisket\" was fat.   No I will not be coming back to this place, modern smoke was better and we all have read their reviews."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time visiting this establishment. I was there with a group of friends. The seating was fast even though our first table was in a bad spot and the waiter was rude. I requested to be moved. From then to the end of the night, service was PERFECT. Our waiter was Erik. He was fast with delivering drinks as well as taking our orders. He was funny and had a smile on his face all night. I ordered the pulled pork with the mac and cheese. Other friends ordered the brisket, ribs, and half chicken. ALL was delicious! Dessert was awesome as well. It was a peaches and cream cobbler! Can you say yum!? I will definitely be going back! Thanks Erik for saving us from the first rude waiter!"}
{"text":"Awesome North Carolina BBQ!  My family and I are down here from Iowa at our nieces wedding and I wanted to experience some traditional NC BBQ as opposed to the traditional sweet and saucy Kansas City BBQ we are used to in the Midwest (which is also awesome by the way).  We did not leave disappointed or hungry.  The service was outstanding and friendly.  The outside seating was great.  The fried pickles left my fried pickle fan daughter impressed.   My vegetarian daughter even crossed over to the \"dark side\" for an evening with the moist pulled pork dinner.  I must say I am a fan of the spicy/tangy North Carolina vinegar based sauce and the baked beans were the best I've ever had.  Spicy and meaty.  A definite winner!"}
{"text":"Solid bbq. Good beer selection. Convenient location right in the heart of Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"After car searching for abt 3hrs, my son and I were hungry and wanted something different. Leaving Independence Blvd. we ventured down Central Ave. surveiling the various restaurants situated along this immensely busy hipster enclave. \"No, I don't want pizza,\" No, I don't want fish tacos,\" No I don't want a burger or ramen,!!!  My son spotted Midwood Smokehouse and took an immediate right. Oh my gosh, never knew I was missing this!!! Have seen Midwood profiled on various local morning shows and I'm a sparerib officianato!!!  I ordered the burnt ends w/Mac & cheese. Son ordered the BBQ plate w/creamed corn. We shared a large chopped salad(delicious) as appetizer. Oh, I also had crinkle cut fries, my fav, as 2nd side. I love into those hot, crispy fries 1st thing. OMG, even the ketchup was good!!! Needless to say, most of our food was bagged up to take home. The burnt ends, phenomenal!!! The BBQ chopped pork, delicious!!! U rarely find a restaurant where everything on ur plate is outstanding. Midwood Smokehouse has managed to accomplish this. Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"Midwood gets better every time we try it.  Lately we've been ordering to go. Which I realized has become quite popular. People seem to order their smoked meat by the pound. Recently I've been ordering the wings and sweet potato fries. The wings are smoked and I choose to have them dipped in their sauce. This is my favorite kind of wing!!! I love them grilled or smoked versus fried or baked. My husband gets the chopped salad once with chicken and another with salmon. He said it was amazing."}
{"text":"Family Pulled Pork Sandwich and BBQ BEANS. Best BBQ EAST of Salt Lick and Sonny Bryan's so far"}
{"text":"I hate being \"that table\" but some times its just unavoidable. Going to dinner with a large group, majority being kids can be challenging. Add in alcohol and the adults can be equally just as much of pains. Thankfully our kickass server (Dylan) was able to maintain control. Although I do apologize again for our repeated spillings (by the adults).  I came in wanting to try everything. The only meat I didn't include in my order was the burnt ends. It'll have to wait till my next visit. As for everything else, we loved it. Jalapeno's wrapped in bacon were great. Also tried some fries with pork or brisket on them.. The ribs were delicious and fell right off the bone. Pulled pork was exactly how I like. The chicken was my least favorite but even that was good. Sides were what you would normally expect from a place like this.   If you haven't been to Midwood and you live in Charlotte, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ.  Legit NC style.  I know.  I'm a big man who eats BBQ all over this great land.  The service is fast and friendly.  Molly is the best of them all!!  Come show these people some love!"}
{"text":"I love the fun atmosphere of Midwood Smokehouse. The service has been good at the bar. This last time I ordered the roasted chicken, collards and vinegar slaw. I thought that the chicken was a bit dryer than I would like. The first time I ordered the chicken it was just right so maybe this was an anomaly. The collards and slaw were very fine. The take out packaging was good and the bartender checked everything before I left. The biggest negative is their wine offerings. Their beer selection is great but if you are not a beer drinker and prefer wine, it's pretty slim and just \"OK\" even though they serve the wine in very cool cafeteria milk glasses from my youth... Lets put forth a bit more effort on wine please."}
{"text":"The portions were alright. I wouldn't say it's the best, everything has this tangy flavor that I didn't really appreciate. The large sizes are pretty pricey when you get just about the same size as the small. It's alright in general. Nothing major."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of Midwood Smokehouse in Ballantyne.  We went opening weekend and loved it!  Attentive service, friendly staff, hot and fresh food - overall a great experience.  We have been talking about going back and we're looking forward to making it a regular dining out spot.    Fast forward to today - 4th of July.  From the moment outer server came to the table, it was obvious she didn't want to be there.  Same went for management, food runners, etc.  By the time the meal came my husband and I felt like we didn't want to be there either.  Then the food... It was gross.  So apprentice the cooks didn't want to be there either.  We got a plate with 4 meats... The brisket was dry and lukewarm.  The pulled pork was also dry and cold.  The ribs were the only thing that came out hot besides the macaroni and cheese.  Our server didn't come to check on us, we flagged down a food runner to ask for some hot fries, the second set of fries also came back cold!    It's unfortunate that no one wanted to work today.  It has potential, as we loved our first visit.  But went downhill quickly.  Maybe a hot or miss depending on the day."}
{"text":"Usually when you are in walking distance from your hotel that equals poor food options - NOT the case here. Instant classic. Amazing staff/service - out of this world NC b'que - mac n' cheese/hush puppies....hold me. Went twice in one day. If you are near their locations and want legit NC Barbecue, do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Fantastic barbecue in Ballantyne!  (I haven't been to the Plaza-Midwood location so I can't compare the two.)    The burnt ends are delicious; the beef brisket is amazing; the chopped pork is awesome.  I have always gotten excellent, friendly service here.  I brought some foodies from Chicago here- they admitted they were skeptical at first due to the squeaky clean strip mall location (which is, of course, how we roll in South Charlotte)- but they totally freaked out about how legit the food is.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Doesn't compare to Mac's Speed Shop.  My first visit went well, a lazy Sunday afternoon with a couple buddies when they weren't too busy.  The menu looks really good but the pulled pork I ordered didn't stand up to Mac's.  My buddy liked it better than Mac's, but I think he's biased since he lives 2 miles from Midwood Smokehouse (to be honest, I live 2 miles away from Mac's).  My second visit was a complete disaster.  Originally planned to go to Mac's this past Friday (Jun 24) with 5 out-of-town buddies plus 2 others, and got talked into changing to Midwood Smokehouse (same buddy as above).    While their menu states they may run out of bbq from time to time (never seen a restaurant advertise running out of food before, but whatever), they were out of pulled pork bbq on Friday night at 8:00, and also out of bacon wrapped jalepenos (gotta love the south, they wrap everything in bacon).  I ordered a rack of ribs to compare to Mac's and they tasted like they were cooked in the oven as they had zero smoke flavor.  The bbq sauce didn't help at all, too bland.  The waiter hooked us up with wings since they were out of pork bbq and the wings were supposedly smoked but had zero flavor.  No rub, no sauce, no nothin.  The mac & cheese however was very good (close to Mac's).  I tried my buddy's sausage and it was dry and tasted like cardboard.  Midwood Smokehouse has been open for only 2 months, hopefully they step up their game!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in to the last drink....awesome experience! Michael crushed it! He shared the favorites, spoke to the changes on the menu and the adult beverage variety is fantastic...the BURNT ENDS were monstrous and packed full of flavor!!!  I'll fly back again!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got the brisket which was perfect and the mac n cheese was so good! Probably my favorite bbq place in Charlotte. The atmosphere was very warm and our waitress was friendly!"}
{"text":"Very good spot for bbq and smoked wings. Good local beer and bourbon selection. Very casual setting but the service was above average."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeños, beef brisket and Mac and cheese. EVERYTHING was excellent! This is definitely a place that will stay on my go to list. They provide a good quantity of food for the cost. I'm looking forward to my leftovers for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Some of the best food we have ever had, the sides are amazing and the bbq and brisket are wonderful."}
{"text":"Bigger fan of the Midwood - Central Ave - not a big fan of the Ballantyne location - loved the brisket - mac and cheese - just okay - love the dessert - great service"}
{"text":"I visited Midwood to help settle a bet between friends on what is better... Macs or Midwood. I will start this review by saying that I tend to prefer NC vinegar-based BBQ. However, arguably my favorite part of BBQ is the delicious sides, yum! This is were Midwood let me down. While the beans were very good, the mac and cheese was dry and congealed (not very appetizing at all). We also tried the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno peppers. These were good, but nothing too special. We tried the Carolina Pork and the Burnt Ends. I was not a fan of the sauce on the Burnt Ends. The pork was good, we tried all the sauces and they were decent, but they were a little stingy on them. I love sauce and am use to having a squirt bottle full of sauce. Overall it was ok, but I definitely prefer Macs or 521."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, get the pulled pork on SOMETHING.  ANYTHING.  You can buy the meat by the pound, so consider taking some home with you.  The pulled pork makes for one AMAZING omelet.  Trust me, my friends.  There's a lot to love at Midwood, and some of my favorites are the pulled pork sandwich, pull pork Cuban sandwich, brisket sloppy joes, queso with pulled pork, and the Midwood chop salad with pulled pork and avocado goddess dressing.  You get your choice of BBQ sauce, and my favorite is the Eastern NC.  The mac and cheese and hushpuppies are great as well."}
{"text":"My sister and I were visiting from NJ and wanted to get some good barbeque while down south. We split the combo platter and it blew our taste buds (in a good way)! The brisket, ribs, and pulled pork were just melt-in-your flavorful, even without the sauces. Which, by the way, THE SAUCES: some sort of magical mustard, a sweetly vinegar-y NC style sauce, and the best classic BBQ sauce I've ever had. Add to that some delicious hushpuppies & great service (thanks Mindy!), and I'd say it was a meal I'll dream about!"}
{"text":"On the never ending search for good BBQ, I stopped in at Midwood last night.  Me and my entourage of 7 were greeted promptly by a friendly server who was in the beginning stages of laryngitis, poor guy.    A few members of my party were from out of town and we wanted to try a bit of everything.  We got the pulled pork and smoked turkey plates with a sample of all of their sauces.  The pulled pork was good, and their sauces were decent.  My party preferred the Fat Tire BBQ Sauce which was a bit too peppery and thick IMO but it did in a pinch.  Smoked turkey was a bit lacking and was a little dry.    The service was great and accommodating.  We were there on a mission and they accommodated all of our special requests without a roll of the eyes.  I passed by the \"smokehouse\" on my way in from the parking lot, but didn't taste the smoke int he food which was disappointing.  Their mayo slaw was overly chopped but had good flavor.  BBQ Slaw is never my thing but there's was ok.  Midwood has decent cue, don't get me wrong and if I Was on that side of town again and in the mood for BBQ I'd go again."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night, at the request of some friends visiting for the holidays. For one of them, it was their first NC BBQ experience and that makes me sad because this place leaves a lot to be desired.   First, they were out of three of the menu items we tried to order, one of which was ribs. How does that happen!? It was pretty busy, and this place seems to have a following, so maaaayyyyybe that's why. Still, it's a bummer to have your heart set on ribs when going to a smokehouse, only to find out they have none.  Second, since they were out of ribs, they offered to sub an item in their \"well-fed\" menu option FOR AN UP CHARGE. If you run out of an advertised item, and offer to substitute, don't follow that offer with a price tag.   Third, the food we ordered was bad. Plain and simple. The pulled pork and chicken were dry; the baked beans were more shredded meat than beans; the smoked veggies were flavorless and cold; and the coleslaw... well, that was actually pretty good. Our food also came with a side of hush puppies and \"pickled\" onions, both of which aren't even worth mentioning, really.   Fourth, the service was mixed. The hostess was super friendly, and we were seated fairly quick, despite a crowd. Or waiter wasn't exactly rude, but he also wasn't very good at his job. A few questions about their drink menu were answered with a very blunt \"I have no idea\" with absolutely zero effort to find an answer that was actually helpful. He checked in frequently enough, and was friendly-ish, so I guess that counts for something.   I walked out of this place feeling so confused. How can it be rated so high!? Did I catch them on an off night? Is it resting on its laurels vs it's actual abilities? Has no one who has eaten here ever eaten BBQ anywhere else, and therefore has no idea that this place is mediocre, at best? I really hate to give such a bad review to a Charlotte eatery, especially when I'm clearly in the minority by doing so. But I can't, in good-Yelping-faith, say otherwise."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their mac & cheese, I could eat it all day. I had the fatty brisket and it is very fatty and a bit salty. I think next time I will shift to the less fatty choice. Otherwise, I enjoyed the place. I've been there about three or four times now and I will return again."}
{"text":"Yes indeed, this joint was on point!! From the young, fun and courteous hostess, to the bar keep, this establishment knows how to take care of it's patrons.  I must admit that their smoked bacon wrapped jalapenos were tasty, but lacking any type of heat. Our waitress (Sheena/Sherra) said that too many customers complained that they were too hot, so they now remove all the seeds...booo!  Moving on, our meal was \"SLAP YOUR MOMMA\" delicious. Their grilled veggies were perfect, the chopped salad with green goddess dressing was heavenly and the rack of ribs was tasty as all get out! They offer up 3 types of sauce, house, mustard and a fiery jalapeno, I   tried each and all had their own goodness, but the jalapeno was my favorite.  Finished out this great meal with an amazingly delicious pecan cobbler ala mode that sent my taste buds into the stratosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fast food delivery. Everything tasted great. We shared the sampler plate with all the meats. My cocktail was superb. Creamed corn and mac and cheese were amazing. Palmetto cheese fries were just so so."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, reasonable lunch prices, lots of great local beers on tap.  Service was excellent and burnt ends were amazing"}
{"text":"Food and service awesome. From the time we walked in and were seated we waited for nothing. Staff and management very attentive and food can I just say it my waist line is gone yummy we will continue to go back. Love everything affordable for my size family and barbecue like no other."}
{"text":"Crispy wings. Bacon wrapped jalapeños.  Whiskey.   I hope these items are mentioned in my eulogy and my funeral is catered by this place.   Stop what you're doing. This. Is. The. Place."}
{"text":"I come to midwood fairly often, and have spoken highly of them to others. Their food had always been great to me, but the last couple times I've been less than impressed.   The food was still okay - I love their sauces, but the jalapeño poppers were over cooked and mushy, the meat portions seem to have gotten smaller, and the service has become spotty.   My last visit was the worst service I've had here. Our food came out, and our server dropped our check off before I'd even taken a bite of my sandwich. He seemed to want us to leave, and I immediately felt in a rush to do so. He refilled my cup but neglected to refill my partners. And we definitely weren't hanging around to try to get anything else from Paul and inconvenience him. So instead of ordering desert (our check was already on the table remember), and getting another drink... we ate our food in less than 20 minutes and left. We went somewhere else for desert and received better service.   I hope that Midwood returns to how it used to be, for now they've lost a fan."}
{"text":"this was my third time at this location. First visit was within a month of the opening and everything was great, food, service and atmosphere. my second visit was a month later was considerably different. Dined in, poor  service and received the wrong food order twice.not really a major problem because we were in no hurry and the waitress was new. But this third and last visit was today. Take-out order for myself and my brother who had never been there before  that take-out order was incomplete not once but twice.  Thank goodness we checked the order before we left. The manager was very responsive and tried to give us partial credit for our food order. We said no thanks just needed a complete order. The barbecue pork was greasy and very salty this time   macaroni cheese was delicious and the smoked chicken was tender  it is quite apparent that this location has a higher turnover of staffing based on my observation and service   Unfortunately this will be our last visit at this location. The other location is excellent food and wonderful service"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!! We split a combination platter and got to try their pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and the best ribs I've ever had with sides of creamed corn and delicious Mac and cheese and hush puppies. We tried all four of their BBQ sauces and they were all fantastic, and we topped off our meal with delicious banana pudding. We also had a great waitress while we were there for lunch. This is hands down our favorite barbecue restaurant in Charlotte and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First, let me start this review with saying I am a MEAT man.  Walking through the front door my senses perked up with the very delicious smokehouse smell.  We arrived on a Friday around 11:15 AM to beat the lunch crowd and there were only a few tables seated.  Our waitress was great and helped us through the menu and local beer options (we told her that we were newbies).  Items that we ordered:  1) Bacon wrapped jalapenos - YUM and very spicy, nice kick and goes along with beer.  2) Pig Out - 4 meats - Turkey, Brisket, Ribs and Pulled Pork - WOW.  Simply amazing!  So much food we split it and brought the rest home for dinner.  One note the baked beans were probably the best ever (laced with meat).  Please check this place out if you have not tried it.  I found this restaurant on Yelp and appreciated the other reviews from the Yelp community.  You will not be disappointed and I look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"Best, tender smokey biscuit I've ever had. The bacon wrapped jalapeños were tasty, and the chopped pork was excellent."}
{"text":"Having tried Mac's, Sauceman, The Q, and Midwood - I'm ready to call this contest for Midwood.  Everything I've eaten there has been beyond belief.  The other places seem to have some issue - too fatty, lack of flavor, too much sauce.  Midwood strikes a perfect balance with the bbq. The sides are also amazing. The only knock is the beer selection - Mac's and The Q have them beat."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  I have been there 2 times and both times had issues with overcharging!  That is a turn off.  First time, the grilled cheese sandwich was marked up by $5.00 the menu had one price and the ticket was $5.00 more (when we asked the server the manager came over and said that was what the computer was ringing up)  and at that same time we did a 2 person dinner and switched out one of the items unaware that the switch would cost us $5.00.  Just be upfront!  Second visit, the server suggested switching out something and never mentioned an up charge, when the check came they charged me $5.00 more for mixing beef burnt ends with pork.  I don't care but if it is your suggestion just tell me upfront that it will cost me more and let me decide.    Be aware and check your check!"}
{"text":"I travel to Charlotte occasionally for work, and it had been about a year and a half since my visit last week. Every time I visit, I'm reminded of two things (1) Authentic southern food is incredibly underrated, and (2) the service in the south blows service I've had anywhere else out of the water. The place to remind me of both of those things on this visit was Midwood. I left borderline uncomfortably full but wondering whether I could have eaten even more without serious discomfort. The food here is that good.  I've had some tasty brisket in my life. However, my brisket evaluation scale is now irreversibly warped, with Midwood being a \"10\" and the next best maybe approaching a 6. The pulled pork, too, was so much better than any I'd ever had, including that from Revival (an acclaimed Southern-style restaurant in Minneapolis) that I consider to be top-notch. Both the brisket and pork are the perfect combination of tender, juicy, and flavorful. This place obviously takes a tremendous amount of pride in cooking and preparing pulled meats. Perhaps I'm just awestruck due to my lack of experience with delicious southern cuisine, but needless to say, I highly recommend it.  I was too distracted by the awesomeness of the brisket and the pulled pork that I really didn't pay much attention to the mac and cheese and baked beans I had as sides, but I remember them being excellent. Especially the baked beans.  As for service, the food did take a while, but our server was pleasant, charming, and checked back on us at the perfect frequency. She appeared to genuinely enjoy her job and made it her goal to ensure that we left with smiles on our faces. I really, really wish she could teach servers in Minneapolis how to treat patrons. I will be back the next time I'm in the CLT!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Burnt tips are like nothing I've ever had. Also sampled my wife's grilled cheese  (with pork), which was awesome.   Good local craft beer selection as well, and our waiter was really helpful and attentive.   Terrific lunch experience!"}
{"text":"As big fans of the original Midwood Smokehouse on Central Avenue, we couldn't WAIT to visit the new Ballanyne location, just 15 minutes from our house. And despite waiting nearly 40 minutes for a table, we were not disappointed. The brisket and pulled pork were both cooked to perfection, the mac & cheese was delicious, and the hush puppies completely irresistible. As at the original location, the beer selection was outstanding, with a wide variety of local crafts on tap and an extensive menu of bottles.   My only real complaint was the lack of seating in the hostess area, which made the long wait for a table more unpleasant than it needed to be -- especially with the kids in tow. But otherwise, the Ballantyne location is another fantastic addition to the Queen City's 'Q' scene!"}
{"text":"Charlotte's best BBQ joint serves up outstanding brisket, tasty pulled pork and one of the best beer selections in the city. The Mac & Cheese is second to none, and the fries crisp and delicious. The family-friendly atmosphere is wonderful, with spacious tables and booths, and service is always prompt and efficient.   There's a small patio for outdoor dining, ample parking in a private lot (or curbside), and a spacious bar for those dining alone. There's also a Ballantyne location for those prefer to stay in the friendly confines of South Charlotte, but for my money, nothing beats the original."}
{"text":"Had the brisket with hush puppies and bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers. The brisket was tender and pulled apart with just a fork. Sat outside and really enjoyed the atmosphere. The music playing in the background was good and just the right level."}
{"text":"Super busy parking lot behind Park Road Plaza!  Party of 8 and and we got the large private room. They placed Cartoons on the TV for the kiddo and you can upgrade your beer for $1!  This place was amazing.  Awesome customer service!   Brisket 1/2 lean 1/2 fatty- and it was glistening! I did not want to switch or share it with my husband. Next time I want all lean but my husbands prefers it 50/50. ( this is also his goto dish)   Burnt tips cooked with cheerwine- it Friday's special and it was good too. Not as fatty as I expected and its better then I believed.   Kiddos- ordered cheese dip and chips. No one enjoyed the dip but the chips were enjoyed by the kids.    Mac and cheese- kids did not like it but husband enjoyed it.   Grilled veggie- cup size for a size order and I wished there were more vegetables available.   Sweet potatoes- were typical   Hushpuppies- crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. I had to push them away they were so good!   Pickled onions- came with the meal and I had to order a cup full. I loved these and I can't believe I forgot the onions!"}
{"text":"To preface, I don't like southern food that much to begin with so my ratings may be biased. The food was fine.I had the pulled north carolina pork which was good but just a lot of meat. It had good flavor and the sauce was tasty. Highly recommend the bacon wrapped jalapeno's stuffed with cheese. They were definitely the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"When President Obama and Hillary Clinton made a a pit stop at Midwood Smokehouse, then it must be the one spot everyone may agree on. So when I had the chance to be in Charlotte, BBQ is what was for dinner. Who would want to miss out on this.   I sat at the bar and ordered the large Beef Brisket plate with two sides (Classic Mac & Cheese and Smoked Veggies) with hushpuppies & pickled onions.  Oh my Goodness. Very delicious and generous North Carolina barbecue for for under $20.   A meal at Midwood will never fill you with regret.  Five Yelps"}
{"text":"Food:  Delicious without a doubt  Waitress service:  Impecable.  Laura was very tentative and friendly  Host/hostess:  Whoever was working the lunch shift needs to quit.  As my buddy and I walked into the restaurant, they just looked at us and didn't seem too friendly.  After finishing our meal, we walked towards the front doors, passing the host/hostess.  They didn't say a word to us as we walked by.  Talk about douchebags with no customer service skills.  Won't be going back to this \"overhyped\" place."}
{"text":"WINNER!  Situated in the Plaza/Midwood neighborhood with a diverse staff and clientele. My husband got the smaller, 4-item combo platter (BBQ chicken, Carolina pork BBQ, brisket & ribs) with creamed corn & BBQ slaw. I got the Carolina BBQ with bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers. For dessert, we got the banana pudding (oh my yummy) & chocolate-chip bread pudding. The desserts were slow coming out & when the manager realized it, he comped both of them. The place was busy, people constantly arriving & leaving, but nobody waited more than a few minutes (we were sitting near the front door) and ample (& friendly) wait staff helped everything flow smoothly. They get 5 stars for sure. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Rainy Sunday lunch. Beer selection is good, adequate and cold enough.  Food was very good. Wife had tacos and preferred the Stockyard as it had a great unique flavor while the Red Neck was equally good but had that expected in a southern pull pork BBQ joint.  I had the pull pork sandwich was pretty dog gone good with the BBQ slaw on it. The vinegar based \"sauce\" was unique which should have pushed the ranking to 5 stars, but ... The \"beef\" I have with the place is the price. $7.50 for a sandwich and $10 for 2 tacos is steep which for those prices should have included a couple hush puppies - a staple of all southern BBQ joints."}
{"text":"Love this place! The crew got bbq nachos which were fab. I got wings with homemade dressing. The rest of the crew got burnt ends and brisket. Def do sliced brisket, not the burnt ends.....you'll see why. I was very surprised how good it all was. Going back."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place finally opening. I saw it in the works on my drive home every single day. We tried it out only a few days after it had opened. It wasn't packed by it was definitely a good kind of busy for a Monday night. I was really really excited about the cheese stuffed jalapenos wrapped with bacon (which were EXCELLENT) but what topped the cake for our meal were the pimento cheese fries with bbq brisket on top. SOOOOO gooooood. I've been craving some ever since I left! Between the two of us we got sloppy joes, a simple bbq sandwich and creamed corn. Everything was so tasty. The only reason I give it four stars was because it was a little pricy for the BBQ plates but our sandwiches and apps were decently priced. And I can't wait till they open up their balcony on top!  The service was excellent as well. Our server really knew what she was talking about and she was very quick and helpful."}
{"text":"So excited to have this location open. My go to is  the Texas Style brisket sandwich with blue cheese with a side of mac and cheese. I love their brisket!  After my sister in law raved about the 1930 cheese steak (made with their brisket) I had to branch out. It was really good. The american cheesy was melted goodness. But the Texas Style brisket sandwich with blue cheese still remains my favorite. There is just something about the blue cheese with their bbq sauce and the red smoked onions that is just amazing."}
{"text":"I first went to Midwood when it first open and all I can remember is the mac and cheese. I'm a huge mac and cheese lover so it doesn't necessarily say anything about the entree that I ordered but I was never really motivated to go back.  Well this past weekend we were in the area so we stopped by. My boyfriend pointed out the brisket sandwich and I knew that is what I had to get. Tender brisket on Texas toast with red onions and the best part  . . . blue cheese. It not only lived up to expectations it exceeded it. The flavor was great. And yes, I did get the mac and cheese again and it was as great as I remembered it.  Another must try is the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos.  They are great.  Wish they had been a little spicier but that can be hard to gage when it comes to jalapenos.  I am already ready to head back to have that sandwich again."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. If you're not big on vinegar based BBQ sauce, try their house made sauce. The greens, Mac and cheese and hush puppies are delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The foods great! Especially the smoked wings and the pulled chicken-"}
{"text":"When I pulled up outside, the scent wafting through the air convinced me that nothing that smells THAT good can possibly be that boy.  And I wasn't wrong!  Overall, this I'd rate this a strong 4.5.  This place is uber-fantastic!  The first night, I ordered the beef brisket and my partner ordered the pulled pork.  Each came with a different barbecue sauce.  The brisket was so tender that I barely needed the butter knife that accompanied my fork.  Both the pork and beef had a great smoky flavor that was good even without the sauce (although it was better with just a little bit of sauce on it).  I had the macaroni and cheese, which was DIVINE!  It also had a hint of smoky cheddar flavor.  I also had the privilege of eating the brown sugar bacon.  OMG, it blew my mind!  My partner remarked that it was like \"eating a pecan pie from a cooked pork belly.\"  It was a perfect combination of sweet and salty bacon-y goodness.  For dessert, we tried the pecan cobbler, which was so, so good - like eating a warm pecan pie.  My second trip I went at lunch and had the barbecue chicken and the bacon-wrapped jalapeno bites.  They were very good and not terribly spicy, but a little more cheese stuffed inside would have been perfect.  The chicken came with a mustard sauce, which I didn't try (not a mustard fan), but I was able to get a different sauce with it on the side.  Chicken was tender and flavorful, and less smoky-tasting than their other barbecued meats.  For dessert we had the cream cheese brownie, which was large and tasty, but very light on the cream cheese.    I have to agree with others that the picked onions and hush puppies were just ok (although I'm admittedly not a fan of raw onions).  Tables are a little close together in there, but they do have some outdoor seating available.  Service was good both times, even when they started to get pretty busy.  Prices are pretty reasonable - about $10 to $15 average per dinner.  Portion sizes are quite large; I had plenty to eat, but still had a lot of leftovers.  They offer some less-unhealthy options, such as a couple of different salads, steam veggies, and smoked veggies.  You can also get three side items for $7, in case you want to go that route.  This is my new go-to barbecue place.  I want to try nearly everything on their menu.  If you're coming here, come hungry!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  If you crave a slightly greasy, chain BBQ taste with a pre-fab interior you may like it.  Me - I would HIGHLY recommend you venture further south to Rock Store in Waxhaw.  You'll be glad you did..."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had outside of Austin Texas!  I was in Charlotte for business and was eager to experience their BBQ scene.  I was told that I had to try either Midwood or Mac's first.  I chose Midwood which was a good call.  Decor is Texas shabby-chic.  The place was packed from when I entered to when I left about 2 hours later.  Expect a wait unless you choose to sit at the bar, which I did.  But lets move on to the food.  Food is insane.  When I'm in a restaurant that clearly knows their stuff I'll just turn the keys over to my server/bartender and tell them to bring me the drink and meal of their choice.  This was a good call.  Melissa, the bartender took great care of me.  Everything from picking the best IPA in town to letting me sample their burnt ends.  Uniquely great service at an already great restaurant makes this the best BBQ place in CLT.  Brisket was incredible.  It doesn't come served with a slice of white bread like many BBQ buffs might be used to, but I can forgive that slight difference.  Sides were also amazing:  Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno's and Hush Puppies.  Geez... why am I not there right now?  I'm wasting my life...  Small disclaimer, milage may vary with different locations and different meals.  I went to the Ballantyne Midwood a few weeks later for lunch and ordered a pork sandwich and didn't find the meal that impressive.  I chalk this us largely to most BBQ is really about the pure meat, plain and simple and most attempts to dress them up never have the desired effect.  Go there, right now."}
{"text":"Delicious meal.  I went small plate combo with probably the best baked beans I ever had.  The bartender was super nice and fun to talk to."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, both times food was great. I had burnt ends each time, and wasn't disappointed. Beer selection is solid, and their sides are good as well. Highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best Brisket in Charlotte in my humble opinion. Melt in your mouth brisket that as writing this review my mouth is salivating.  I have been a few times and to both the original location, ballantyne, and now so excited to have this location in my back yard.   I burnt ends are amazing and will certainly get them again but my go to item here is the TexasStyleBrisket Sandwich. This sandwich is loaded with smoked shredded brisket, smoked red onions, and your choice of of cheese. I get the blue cheese and that to me my friends completes it. Well almost completes it because you need the mid wood sauce ( that of a spicy varietal is my choice) but will also use multiple sauces to  get a different flavor each bite.   Sides you can go with a few different options and yep you know I went with the mac and cheese which is a solid choice for sure.  Another side I would recommend is the hickory smoked bacon wrapped jalapeños with jack cheese. Dip these in ranch and  can you say out of bounds:"}
{"text":"Its been years since I've had quality BBQ and on my whirlwind business trip through North Carolina, was able to stop at Midwood for lunch.  Best stop I made on my trip.    Found parking on the street outside and stepped inside to a casual restaurant with friendly service.    Started off with the bacon wrapped jalapenos.  Was on a phone call, chatting away and next thing I knew, they were gone.    And then the BBQ arrived...  Carolina Pork-Smoked, tender, flavorful and exactly what I've been missing.  I'd like to consider myself  a memphis bbq connoisseur; however, this pork was excellent in its own right.  And that vinegar sauce?  I'm not a fan of sweet sauces and their sauce's blend of vinegar and spices was a perfect pairing.  I didn't need anything else, but the goodness didn't stop there.  Creamed Corn-creamy & buttery perfection. Hush Puppies-WHAT?!  I haven't had Hush Puppies this good since 1987 in the bootheel of Missouri.  Excellent BBQ and sides and Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Good North Carolina-style BBQ sauces!  Thumbs up from this Midwesterner!  Everything on the sampler was great, but the beef brisket was by far the best of the bunch.  They have mastered searing a thin layer of charcoal-crisp-goodness that brings the dish into another category."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, but first time visiting. Absolutely loved it! good flavor, nice ambience, and DELICIOUS!! Was packed when I went (not surprised..) and it was late so had to eat small..but looking forward to going again to grub big!"}
{"text":"First time I've been here on Friday the 13th of all days. Well the bad luck ended at the door. Child it smelled good as soon as I walked through. It's my birthday so our waitress was overjoyed she got to serve us. I ordered a platter of ribs, brisket, pulled pork and hickory smoked sausage. My cousins ordered whatever they ate I forgot as my belly was blocking my view. I ate and ate. They have cheerwine sauce which when eaten with any meat is like a shot of sodie in yer mouf. 'Twas a great experience y'all need to come here order a plate and eat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a Wednesday and their special for the day was the burnt ends with cheerwine sauce. I explained to my waitress that it was my boyfriend's first time trying Carolina bbq and I wanted him to taste the vinegar based sauce. She said \"No problem!\" and brought out the Carolina bbq sauce along with the cheerwine sauce. The burnt ends were delicious, the baked beans were probably the best I've ever had at a restaurant, and the hush puppies were...okay :).  They have a nice selection of beer from North Carolina breweries.  Warm service, good food. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very happy with this BBQ. Highly recommend getting the Brisket, Hushpuppies and BBQ Beans.   Service is exceptional and prices are some of the best.   Definitely coming back here next time I'm in North Carolina!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in NC. Midwood Smokehouse didn't disappoint for a quick meal after arriving in Charlotte. Compared to NY, the portions are huge.   I had the Beef Brisket that I topped with the Eastern NC Vinegar Sauce. It was perfection. My boyfriend had the   1/2 Chicken and 1/3 Rack Ribs. Everything was packed with flavor and the service was so fast. We were literally in and out in an hour.   I really suggest this place for a great evening meal if you are visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Brisket 5 stars for the ICE chips. Small and SOFFTTTTTT  5 stars for their hours. 11pm makes for some decent times to eat brisket.  2 stars for those bacon wrapped jalapenos. I would not recommend.  4 stars for the greens. YES!!!! I'd recommend. Flavored right but wish they added Mustard or Turnips to them. And offer more.  3.9 stars for the hush puppies with every meal. Good crisp but I'm not certain it's always fresh.   5 stars for our burger. The kid highly recommends.  0 stars for the price upgrades on Double ribs, Bone-in Chicken, et al on the $26 Well Fed Platter.  2 stars for not having more BBQ sauces to try. I guess Famous Dave's spoils me.  Mac & Cheese = ok. NO hand cut fries.  Texas Toast is extra.  Daily specials worth returning for! They sell out fast.   Oh! 1st visit was Thursday, 9/28/17 & they were sold out of ribs @ 9pm, EST.  I wasn't bothered but made me return. I left with Brisket to go and got the mixture of lean and fatty + jalapenos and I can say... I understand why everyone talks about the brisket here.   :* :*   Next time, I'll shoot for chicken (bone-in) and smoked wings and some more brisket.  Oh! Their sausage isn't bad. It's not beef but not bad.   P.P.S. That cheese dip with brisket - bleh. That cheese dip isn't even Sam's Club in the metal can. It's just tasteless and I would never recommend.   Why the 5 stars? P.P.P.S = Great service + BEST ICE away from Tijuana Flat + BRISKKKKEEETTTT. And the greens~  Muah. :* Parking is available.  Outdoor seating and it fills up quickly after church but decent space regardless of the hour.  I'm shocked there's not more locations."}
{"text":"Great place for meat person like me!!! Highly recommend Bacon wrapped jalapenos and smoke wing for appetizer and combo for two!! Be there early if it's weekend night I went there saturday night and waited for half an hour."}
{"text":"Good service. Food was tasty but nothing extraordinary. Wait staff was friendly and timely. Not a bad place to eat in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great plate of 1/2 a rack of pork ribs. Great sauces to enjoy on the side with hush puppies, however the sweet potato fries weren't all consistently cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on an empty Sunday rainy night. Had 2 craft brews and Started with the beef brisket queso dip & chips. Decent probably would pass next time. Heavy cheese topped with beef brisket. It was definitely good but would try another appetizer next timeS Entree - Pulled chicken with 2 sides- creamed corn (it has tiny jalapeños , but the spice is mild) , & roasted veggie! Amazing! Huge portions brought half home!  Hubby got the Texas beef brisket sandwich - on Texas toast stacked with cheese & beef brisket. Again, bringing half home.  Ending the night with a small banana pudding! (I could of licked the bowl, it was that good!)  For all that food, it was less than 50! Including 2 brews. Customer service and attentiveness on point plus amazing food!!"}
{"text":"A really good experience.   Great service and really good food.  Server offered  and brought a sample of brisket to the table.   We are in town for a week and after the meal we were trying to figure out when we could come back.   Nice draft selection with good smoked meats equals winner."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio, great service and fantastic bbq!!! Loved this place and their food. We ordered the pimento cheese fries with brisket on top to start. It was incredible, so much flavor. For our meal, we shared 4 proteins and 2 sides; ribs, shredded pork, brisket and we upgraded to burnt ends (great decision, highly recommend). Our sides were bacon wrapped jalapenos and smoked veggies which I would order again. Excited there is a location in columbia which is closer to us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly.  The food came out fast!   A friend, who was not hungry, ordered fries with pulled pork that was in the appetizer menu and love it! She had lunch and still took half of the dish home. It was huge!!!  I was expecting a bit more for my ribs. They were well seasoned but not fall of the bone as I would have liked them to be.   The pork burned ends on the other hand..... I could eat a family size portion of it and would ask for more!!!! The fatty bits were perfectly balanced with the meaty soft bits. The sauce it was tossed in was sweet, salty and tangy. Amazing!!!   For sides - sweet potatoes fries, can't go wrong with anything fried and baked beans."}
{"text":"I am visiting from D.C. and thought I would visit the place. The BBQ was excellent and the customer service was very good. Very nice selection of draught beers. Must try! Parking is the only drawback, but not really a problem."}
{"text":"As it is right down the street I frequent this place quite often. I have never sat down and ate so can't comment on the service but for $20 I get a pound of BBQ and a large side of Mac N Cheese. I have always been impressed and the food is consistently great. They offer 2 different BBQ sauces and typical Eastern NC Vinegar and a more sweet and tangy sauce. My favorite is the sweet and tangy. Mac N Cheese is also delicious as well. I am very particular about restaurant Mac but you won't be disappointed.   As I said earlier I have never sat down inside the restaurant and ate but they are always packed when I go to pick up and it's in the Plaza/Midwood area which is quite trendy. I would recommend this place to all BBQ connoisseurs and those looking for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Stopped here while traveling because we were in the mood for BBQ and we checked Yelp. Fantastic!!! Tried burnt ends and pulled pork and they were terrific. Tried several sides and they were great also. Recommend especially the collard greens, Mac & cheese, bacon wrapped jalapeños."}
{"text":"Food was great, loved the ambiance-- great music! Cameron took great care of us- his service was awesome. My family and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I've been eating at Frank's restaurants since he went into business. This by far is the worst run! I called and inquired as to the wait time and they said that there wasn't one. We get there 10 minutes later and they said it would be at least 45 minutes . Hostess seemed totally indifferent. Too bad. Too good a restaurant to fall victim to poor staffing."}
{"text":"Yelpers seem to love this place, so in planning a trip to Charlotte I decided it was a must do. We walked in on a busy Sunday and were advised that a seat at the bar would be the fastest way to food. We were warmly greeted and ordered sweet tea as we browsed the menu. The tea was perfectly syrupy sweet and we received our meals shortly after ordering. I ordered the Carolina pork plate with bacon wrapped jalapeños, fries, and hush puppies. My boyfriend had the Cuban and the BBQ slaw. After we received our meal a refill was hard to find, which as I ate jalapeños was annoying. The food was good, I found I am just not a fan of \"dressed\" pulled pork. I prefer to add my level of sauce. Overall it was tasty and very reasonably priced. We'd visit again."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and Service.  The mustard and vinegar BBQ sauce was great.  The waiters were very friendly and talkative.  Had a great time."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant I've eaten at in Charlotte, so far. I came here on the 4th of July and had a great experience. Service was fast and extremely friendly.   Food was AMAZING (the queso cheese is utterly life-changing; I've had dreams about it for the past couple of weeks, I kid you not). Everything was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere of the place is spot-on, too.   Warning for anyone who comes to visit me in Charlotte from now on - we will share at least one meal here, so come prepared."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. This was my first time there. Even though my girlfriend doubted the creamed corn (she's from Cali) she absolutely loved it and ate the whole bowl by herself. How shellfish!!! But no, please go eat here, the best food that we have had in the past 2 weeks of being in NC!! Get the ribs, highly suggested!!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Midwood Smokehouse, but a while back they phased out our favorite menu item, the creamed corn.  We were in the restaurant a few months back and expressed our disappointment to the manager, Kristin.  She was extremely nice, and took our feedback.  She also took our number and promised to let us know if the creamed corn was to be released again, even if only for a limited time.  Fast forward to today, months later, and imagine our surprise when we received a text message from Kristin letting us know that Midwood Smokehouse has added creamed corn back to the menu!!!  Regardless of the menu item being back, we were SHOCKED that this manager went out of her way to follow up with us and make sure we were happy, even months later.  You DO NOT see this kind of service anywhere and I can't believe she even remembered this encounter.  We immediately changed our plans for the evening and went in to Midwood for dinner.  Our food and service was great as usual, but the creamed corn was AMAZING.  It is back on the menu with a jalapeno twist and it was out of this world.  We will continue to go visit Midwood Smokehouse and I can't shout loud enough how cool it was to get that text message today... not only because I love the creamed corn, but because I appreciated her taking the time to do that so much.  Kristin deserves a RAISE!!  :)  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Amazing fatty brisket and baked beans. Skip the burnt ends. Service was phenomenal.  If I could go back, I would:  Uber, drink a cocktail, get to go containers of fatty brisket, and some t-shirts."}
{"text":"Amazing every time! We love this place. By far the best BBQ in Charlotte. Try the brisket and the bacon wrapped jalapeños. Also, they have great beer selections!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and really reasonable.  I prefer the brisket sand which with blue cheese.  I also think their baked beans and collard greens are their best side items.    Mac and cheese was just mediocre.  Beer prices seem normal and service is always good.  I haven't had to wait for a table many times either.  Parking absolutely sucks though."}
{"text":"My friends know that I WANT to like BBQ. It always looks and smells so good, then I have a bite and I'm over it...so as kind of a joke, I was taken to Midwood Smokehouse. Everything smelt so wonderful, and looked so tasty. Afraid of my past BBQ experiences, I played it safe and went for the smoked turkey plate: hickory smoked and dressed wtth cranberry apple relish, and a side of that creamy mac n cheese! It was AMAZING. The atmosphere was relaxed, the beer selection is fine, and the staff is friendly.  Since my first visit I have been back twice, and have tried variations of the BBQ. I found that I love the vinger style sauce on anything! The only reason I do not go back more often is the wait to be seated can be lengthy, and the wait to get your food and drink refills can also be lengthy. The last time we were there we saw our waitress three times, once to take our drink order, once to take our food order, and once to bring us our check. A food runner brought us our food and passerby employees who saw our drinks were empty would bring us more drinks. Every visit I have had, has been a long one. But when I leave my face is still smiling because my belly is happy."}
{"text":"Fried mac & cheese, hush puppies, gigantic beef rib special and Carolina pork plate.  Yes that is a ton of food, but it was all so delicious.  I was especially enamored with the Eastern NC vinegar sauce.  If it wasn't for the liquid restriction on carry-on items, I would've tried to bring a bottle home.  Maybe I should've tried to portion it out to 3oz bottles.  The mustard sauce that came with the Chicken BBQ was also awesome.  I felt like it would be great to have with a soft pretzel too.  Sadly, those aren't on the menu.  Prices are extremely reasonable for the portion sizes.  I wish I had gone all out and tried the combo platter just to get more options in.  Next time."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, mac n cheese. Big portions and great service. Parking was kind of annoying though"}
{"text":"The best BBQ, so far!  I've had BBQ in  Memphis, Texas, Georgia...but, this by far is the best I've had.  Rendezvous in Memphis do not even come close...this place is wonderful! I tried the plate w/a mixture of Pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends, briquet w/hush puppies (best hush puppies I've had) and the cheesiest, macaroni and cheese.  The baked beans had the right amount of sweet and tangy to it...perfect. Our waitress was very friendly, sweet and on top of her game. This whole experience was so fun and positive, will definitely come back, again. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After a long morning at the office I needed a break but I'm really trying to eat more healthy, but that always seems to go out the window after a hard morning work. I was struggling because the mac and cheese apparently is awesome. I stuck with my new found healthy eating habits and grabbed a salad. After much deliberation I decided on the chopped salad with pulled pork. Great recommendation by my server! I added jalapeños because i like it spicy and my pickled onions on the side (which come with every meal, unless you get a salad). It was a quick lunch and well deserved but I had to get back to the office, but I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The next day, Jim called me back and left a message saying that he wanted to talk and that he saw my review on yelp. Then the next day, one of the owners also called me to discuss the bad experience. When I returned her call, she was incredibly considerate and very apologetic for the way things went. I really appreciated the extra effort she made and will absolutely give Midwood Smokehouse another shot. After all, the food WAS really great."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I've eaten in Charlotte, I've been here the most. So I think it's time I give Midwood Smokehouse its very well-deserved five stars. I'd give it six stars, but Yelp won't let me, so we'll just have to settle for a \"Fuck yeah this place is awesome!\"  In two words, burnt ends.   In many more words, the prices are very reasonable, the service is always fast and polite, there are awesome drink specials, and the vibe is casual, friendly and more than a little bit southern hipster.  As for the food, there is nothing here not to like. The only thing I'm a bit \"meh\" on is the smoked vegetables, but they're still pretty tasty. The chicken is so good, you can eat it \"dry\" (it's plenty moist) or with your choice of outstanding barbecue sauces. The brisket is incredibly delectable - as a friend of mine says, \"Best brisket outside of Texas\" - the fatty brisket especially deserves a freakin' medal. The sausage is a well-thought-out mix of savory and sweet, with a nice pop in the skin when you bite into it. But, the creme de la creme is the burnt ends. So sweet, so chewy, and with a caramelized flavor that is not of this earth.  Every meal comes with your choice of side(s). The bacon-wrapped jalapenos are sinfully masterful. The mac and cheese is delightfully cheesy. The collards are down-home. Everybody also gets some hush puppies and pickled onions - both are amazeballs (literally, in the case of the puppies).  Great local beer selection and some very tasty looking desserts, although I'm always too full to try them."}
{"text":"Amazing menu with great assortment. Good \"southern\" sides and pickled   onions are really, really good.  Hubby had brisket and it was spoon tender. I had burnt ends. Fabulous. Small size platters were really not so small. Great assortment of beers and various wines and the hard stuff.  Nice atmosphere, very friendly staff and quick service.  Very relaxed atmosphere with lots of TV."}
{"text":"Just opened but great food as always at Midwood. Nice atmosphere and very attentive wait staff. Lots of parking as they are \"behind\" Blackhawk Hardware. Do give them a try. You will enjoy I'm sure."}
{"text":"The food was good, I had the steak tips, very tasty with a nice caramelized finish.  I also had the pulled pork. I  wasn't a fan of the vinegar on the pulled pork though.  Service at the bar was definitely lacking.  I constantly had to flag her down to get service for even basic things like silverware and napkin. She kept her back to the bar for about 20 minutes just cutting fruit also.  I would have to yell to her to get her attention when I needed another drink.  I even set my credit card out and timed how long it took for her to pick it up, but after a solid 15 minutes I called out again to just ask her to take it so I could leave.  Not a huge deal but it's frustrating, especially when it was not at all busy."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've ever had. The pulled chicken was a little salty but nothing unbearable or bad. The pork was delicious. We also ordered baked beans, mac and cheese, and fries for our sides and those were all amazing. I'm from SC and the bbq down here doesn't even come close to this place. Highly recommend to all. You have to stop here and eat! The service is pretty awesome too. We went during a non busy time so we probably spent an hour tops here. The parking lot isn't very big so I imagine parking might be a pain during busy hours but it's totally worth it! They also have a lot of local brews on tap"}
{"text":"Burnt ends are the best. This place was one of my favorites when I was in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Wow! thats all I can say...I've been to BBQ places up & down the east coast, and this ranks right up there with the best in terms of quality, value, and customer service.  I had the BBQ Chicken and chopped salad...both off the charts good!!  If you're reading this to decide whether to order here or not...don't deny yourself and TRY IT!!  100% amazeballs!!"}
{"text":"Literally the best BBQ I have ever had. I had the burnt ends (delicious) and another person in my party had the brisket (also delicious). I recommend the fatty brisket, it was truly melt in your mouth. Service was also great! Need to go back and try the banana pudding."}
{"text":"Food was good to great, good beer selection.  Service was great.  had the brisket because they sold out of ribs and burnt ends.  then went back for the ribs.  both were good. I can't give them 5 stars though because the ribs.... something not quite there for me.  good place to go sit outside and just enjoy some good food though."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places in Charlotte! Ordered the nachos with BBQ chicken and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. BBQ is nice and juicy, not dry. Great patio seating and service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we are hooked! Both times we came on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately. There's a smoker in the back of the restaurant so there's always this nice smokey scent inside. Bryan was our waiter both times and he was great. I ordered the smoked chicken with baked beans & macaroni and cheese. It came with a side of hushpuppies. Everything was delicious and the portions are huge. Prices are reasonable also. I love this place & will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I was at first pleased with this place until I got sick from the food. I had the Briskit, which is supposed to be their best item. I am not one to get sick easily from food and when I do it is from very bad food. I know this place is popular and a lot of people seem to love it but to each his own. On top of the food being bad, I felt the service was horrible. It took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and take a drink order. I mentioned that the soda was flat. My server looked at me with an annoyed facial expression like I was wrong. She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no and asked if it could just be changed. Apparently it was too much work to change the soda.  I noticed a girl was getting sick at her table so now I'm wondering if she got sick from the food too. I did call the restaurant tonight and the lady I spoke to was nice but didn't seem to acknowledge the seriousness of the food causing a customer to get sick. She said I may have gotten a bug from somewhere else. The sickness I am feeling is definitely from their food. I don't think anything will be done about this and that really bothers me because this is a serious issue.  I unfortunately will not be returning there and again, I won't be surprised if nothing is done about this"}
{"text":"Great Food, service and best music. Wings are awesome. We will be back. It's been a long time for BBQ and they are spot on."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. The bacon wrapped jalepenos were amazing! The pulled pork was excellent and the banana pudding was the perfect ending to a great meal. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good , and smokey pork , cole slaw and hush pups were kind of average . Baco wrapped stuffed Jalapeños were crazy good with the special Bloody Mary !"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ, The really know how to smoke a brisket!!!  One of my favorite places to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best bbq's I have had. We had ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone delicious. The brisket was also really good. The meat is tender, juicy, and the sauces are oh-so-good. The sides are also very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the greens.  To top it off, our server was friendly and great!"}
{"text":"Another Scibelli restaurant where the food is good but mediocre to poor service is the norm. Most of the servers and staff act as if they are doing you a favor. Ugh. Also, their smokehouse is too small and they are almost always out of at least 2 items by 6pm every night. I have only tried the original location and my review is of the original. I have been coming here since the beginning and it has gotten worse not better with time. It would also be great if they took reservations.  Perhaps they could better plan ahead to accommodate the crowd. I enjoy the food but not the dining experience. I will likely continue to enjoy via takeout."}
{"text":"Still the best.  Love the brisket and collards.  Love the pickled onions.  Always a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stupid good bbq.  I have tried many barbecue joints in NC and was really searching for a place I could take my friends that visit from Kansas City and Texas.  I found my spot.  Unassuming outside, but very cool on the inside.  The local beers on tap were awesome.  The menu offered more than the lexington style pulled pork with slaw.  There was so much I wanted to try on the menu I can't wait to go back.  I had the brisket and mac and cheese.  Both were excellent.  The dry rub/crust on the brisket was smokey and delicious.  I also enjoyed the pickled onions... who knew I liked pickled onions.  When I go back I want to try the burnt ends, greens and bacon wrapped jalapenos."}
{"text":"Honestly not as good as the stars say. The atmosphere is okay. Loud and a long wait. I got the brisket with both fatty and lean pieces but I swear there wasn't much meat, mostly fat. Mac and cheese was thick and nothing special. Its safe to say the hush puppies were my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place last Friday and it was AMAZING!!  The brisket was so tender and yummy.  The hush puppies we delicious too.  The service was outstanding.  The pecan cobbler was so good.  We will def be back.. and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to the Midwood Smokehouse's original location in Plaza Midwood but with the help of my dinner group, we met at this new location because parking is easier.   They took over an old Sticky Fingers location so it has the feel of a family style restaurant rather than the funkiness of the original location.  Our server indicated she was new and she did well despite some challenges. She knew the rotating beer selections which was plus. She told us at first they were out of ribs but then asked how many of us wanted ribs and went back into the kitchen to see how many were available and we were in luck. So a big plus for that.   But parts of the service fell flat. The first part goes to the bar staff.  3 of us ordered the same beer, NoDa's Ramble on Red. Another person arrived later and ordered a Stella and her beer arrived almost immediately.  We waiting close to 30 minutes for the NoDa beers. It was almost like they had to drive up to NoDa and pick up another keg. Thanks to our server for at least following up with them a few times.   Another flaw came with the ordering. One person at our table ordered their meal with cole slaw and sweet potato fries as their sides and they brought out two sides of the fries. After notifying two servers, there were then almost duplicates of cole slaw. So the wait staff seems a bit frazzled here. Is everyone new??  As for food, I had the ribs and they were tender and sauced just right with additional sauce for dipping.  The mac n cheese was amazing! The hush puppies were a bit dry and hard.  So I'd come here for the food but you might want to stick with soft drinks until the bar staff gets their act together."}
{"text":"I came with some friends on a weekend for dinner, and even at around 5 PM, the place was already starting to fill up.  Thankfully, we got a table for the 8 of us.    I ordered the burnt tips, since the description on the menu sounded so promising.  I ordered it with bacon wrapped jalepenos and baked beans as sides.  I got the large portion, but was a little disappointed at how small of an amount of meat it seemed to be.  But even placing that issue aside, the quality of the meat was disappointing.  I mean, burnt tips are my favorite part of brisket - I love the smokiness and depth of flavor the burnt-ness adds to the meat.  Therefore, I thought a whole plate of it would be heaven for me.  Maybe it's the fact that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing - Joey needs Monica just like awesome burnt tips need regular brisket.  They balance each other out.  Or maybe it's that my tips were chewy, dry, and at times hard to eat.  Regardless, I wasn't a fan of burnt tips on their own, and I wouldn't recommend getting it.  Joey just couldn't sustain his own show, right?  Oh, and there were only 3 bacon wrapped jalepenos (which tasted good) and the baked beans were just ok.   My wife got the pulled pork barbecue with a side of smoked veggies.  The barbecue was dry and so-so in flavoring.  It definitely needed the sauce to make it taste better.  And the veggies were not bad.  Our service was pretty friendly and fast, and they did a good job accommodating our table of 6 adults and 2 children.  I was just a bit underwhelmed by the food that we got.  It seemed like the friends we ate with enjoyed their ribs, though.  So maybe next time, that's what I'll try."}
{"text":"Oh my! I'm so impressive with this place. BF and I got a combo platter and a burnt end dish, we were beyond full and satisfied.   For the combo platter we got to ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The ribs and brisket were delicious and tender. The pulled pork was decent but was out shadowed by the ribs and briskets. The sweet potato fries were so crisp, definitely the better side between that and the mac and cheese. Our other dish was the burnt ends with mac and cheese. The hype on the Burnt ends is real! It was the star of our meal! It was flavorful and tender. The two dishes were more than enough for us so don't order with your eyes.   Service was great, our server small talked with us and helped explaining the different meats."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for bbq, this place is IT! great service, our waitress was fantastic and the food was good. My favorite was the wide selection of the diff bbq sauces, ask for all of them. The pulled pork was a bit too salty but everything else was cooked really well (ribs, chicken, sausage, etc- i feel like we tried it all)."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for business and decided to check out some Carolina BBQ. I selected Midwood based on the reviews. The restaurant was busy, but I was seated in about 15 minutes. The hostesses were nice, waitstaff was good. The actual BBQ, however... I tried the Carolina chopped pork. I don't know if it was a good dish done bad, or a bad dish done good, but I found it quite unappealing. I guess I've been spoiled on KC, StL and Texas BBQ all these years. However, the baked beans were a wonder, and almost deserving of an additional star themselves. The neighborhood seems quite trendy. I'm sure I can find some better eats in the area next time."}
{"text":"Having been to the Plaza Midwood location numerous times we are excited they opened closer to where we live. I am surprised by some of the reviews bc we came with a big group and had an excellent meal. The BBQ was just as good as any of our previous meals at the central location. The ribs we had were insanely good along with the burnt ends, pulled pork and brisket. Midwood did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! After reading about it online four of us went and we tried the burnt ends, pulled pork, bacon wrapped jalapenos, sausage, brisket and ribs. Everything was really good, not one thing to complain about. We also got an apple cobbler and banana pudding which were delicious. We would definitely go back. Side note the service was fantastic. Super friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to order."}
{"text":"Very very very good barbeque.  Smoky and tasty.  Side salad is shockingly good for a bbq joint."}
{"text":"OK- we have been going here for years now.   I think the quality might be slipping. Or maybe it is just inconsistent. Sometimes we LOVE THIS PLACE and other times it is \"meh\".  I highly recommend the salad with BBQ and avocado dressing.  My husband recommends the ribs."}
{"text":"Went to this place BECAUSE of all the yelp reviews, so had to come share our experience. First off our waiter, John V was amazing! Knowledgable, personable and on point! He recommended the bacon wrapped jalapeños for an appetizer, they were awesome! I don't do spicy and I truly enjoyed these. He then explained the different meats and how everything was prepared, so we ended up ordering the pig out ( I think that's what it was called - 4 meats, 2 sides ) we got the pork, chicken, ribs and brisket, along with the Mac and cheese and creamed corn John recommended. The sides were phenomenal!! The chicken was beyond fabulous, second I'd say pork, then ribs and finally the brisket - all was great, but not being a big meat eater I'm a bad judge on the harder ones. Also not a fan of NC BBQ \"sauce\" - but it was good here, very mellow. Sadly Sunday early afternoon became VERY busy so our pecan cobbler never came out, so after waiting so long we canceled the order. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe almost 6 months later and I am just now writing this review!  When I was on vacation in June and visiting my sister, she wanted me to try out a 'cue place she told me was pretty solid.  I am indeed a huge fan of Carolina style cue, so I was excited to see how this place would fare against Memphis.  Hidden away in hipsterville, this place is nestled on the bottom left of a I think 2 story strip mall.  There was some construction behind the place, so with that being said, parking was real tight- but I managed to find a spot on the street (and didn't get towed!).  The weather was perfect to eat on the patio, but we decided to eat inside.  Inside, it looked like there were 2 rooms, separated by the bar.  We sat in the bar area- which was cool, because our server was hot as hell- hell yea!  When we got the menus, I was torn about what to get, but I was hungry as hell too- so I got enough food for 3 people- the whole rack of ribs an order of some bacon wrapped jalapenos, and some other stuff.  My sis got a plate of pork with some sweet potato fries.  It looked like they had a pretty solid beer and mixed menu- but the Kentucky slush won me over.  I think I only got 1 (didn't want to get shwasted by 2, even though it was vacay).  It was pretty tasty, but I found it funny they served it in a Shiner (a TX beer) mason jar.  Hell yea!  When the food came out, my eyes opened up wide.  It looked as good as the place smelled.  I tell you what- I will say it again, this is the kind of shit I live for- and those were good enough to be in the top 5 racks of ribs to ever touch these lips.  And It left me full as hell.  I have no idea how I did it, but I dommed the whole plate!  Believe it or not, I didn't get sick either!  However, I did take a nap after the meal :)  A lot of eye candy, solid food and drinks are always a plus in my book.  The place seemed clean as well and they had tvs to keep you entertained if you didn't feel like conversing with your sister.  If parking wasn't such a pain, I would push the 4.5 up to 5 stars!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nothing that blew our minds away, but good BBQ all the way around.  My wife and I dropped in on a Tuesday at about 9pm and the restaurant still had quite a few customers, but there were also plenty of empty tables. We were immediately seated by the hostess and waited on.  As tourists of the area, Midwood was actually our backup choice for BBQ in the city as we were hoping to try Lexington Barbecue, which was about 40 minutes north, since we had read about its authenticity to the region, but it was closed. On top of it, we had read that Midwood was Texas-style BBQ and not Carolina-style, so we were really hoping for Lexington to be open. With all that said, we saw all of the rave reviews for Midwood (4.5 stars from 1100+ Yelp reviews) and the fact that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton had dropped in, so we thought it had to be somewhat good, even if it wasn't representative of North Carolina.  After a review of the menu, we went with a combo platter of Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, chopped chicken BBQ and hickory smoked sausage, and a classic BBQ plate of burnt ends. For our sides, we had the hushpuppies, classic mac & cheese, coleslaw and BBQ baked beans.   Like I said earlier, everything was good, but nothing was interstellar ridiculously great. The real standouts to us were definitely the brisket, burnt ends and sides. The brisket was very tender and juicy. The burnt ends were fatty on one end and meaty on the other, just the way we like them. We loved all of the sides, not much to complain about there. The sausage was also good, but nothing to write home about. As for the chopped (pulled) pork and the chopped chicken, they were a bit dry, but that was to be expected considering what type of meat they were, so make sure to douse them in lots of the house BBQ sauce.   In closing, we liked the down to the Earth atmosphere inside and the modern BBQ restaurant setting. Our waitress wasn't extremely friendly, but she wasn't rude either. They just did their job as expected. Also, other waiters who were wrapping up for the evening passed by during our meal and made small talk so that was appreciated. We just wish we were a bit more enthusiastic about the food after our visit."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for the coke 600 and what would a weekend there be without BBQ. A hotel employee recommend this restaurant to us and I can tell you we are glad they did. 6 of us enjoyed a lot of meat that evenings the brisket was juicy and rich , burnt ends saucy and  flavourful and smoked chicken and ribs amazing.  We didn't have one complaint about this place.  So if your in Charlotte and want smoked meat check this place out , I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for work and being in NC, wanted to get some local BBQ. I was staying downtown and found this place on Yelp. Based off the reviews I checked it out (I had a rental car, you would definitely need to drive if you are staying in downtown). I got carry out as I was by myself but it looked like they had a lot of good local beers on tap I would have liked to try. I got the Carolina Pork and it was really good. The pork was tender and the sauce was just right - the vinegar wasn't too strong at all. The hushpuppies that came with it were REALLY yummy. The pork and those alone would have been enough for me I realized after I started eating but the small came with one side. I got the sweet potato fries and they gave me what seemed like a pound of them. They were good but I barely made a dent in them because the pork and hushpuppies were way too yummy. They have a place at the bar to order specifically for carry out but then didn't really have an area to sit and wait. The bar was full of patrons so I had to stand and wait for my food. I didn't have to wait too horribly long but it was still odd that they didn't have a  waiting spot."}
{"text":"The food is great but the atmosphere is lacking. The bar and the patio is appealing but the room to the right has cheesy decorations, no windows, and dark navy carpet. A redesign would benefit them well. The food is delicious and the service is great. However, on half price wine Thursday they do not have chillers to keep the white wine cold- but we drank it quick enough to not notice."}
{"text":"hmmmm....  Sweetie & I were super excited to check out this restaurant for lunch recently.  We both love barbeque.  I got the small smoked turkey plate with mac & cheese & sweetie got the chicken with south carolina style mustard sauce.  He got the creamed corn.  The sides were really good & we enjoyed them.  Maybe we picked the wrong things (?!), but for a place that smokes their own meats I'm sad to say we were disappointed.  The smoked turkey looked beautiful, but it was dry & mostly tasteless.  Not very smoky at all!  I doused it with barbecue sauce, but it didn't help much.  Sweetie's chicken was o.k., but that mustard sauce was weird... not a true SC sauce at all!  It tasted like it had cumin in it & we both agreed that if you put it over rice with some naan bread on the side, you'd be eating Indian.  It has a fun atmosphere.  Drew was our server & he was super friendly and helpful with the menu & explained the restaurant and set up since it was our first time there and always kept our drinks filled.  There is an upstairs area with a great view of uptown, but for some odd legal reason they can't serve up there.  People will just get a to-go order & go upstairs & seat themselves.  We might try it again & check out the brisket or pork. Maybe."}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of BBQ meats and types of dishes.  I have eaten several. My favorites so far are the Burnt Ends, beef brisket ends, with great smoked flavor.  Also the St Louis baby back ribs Just melt in your mouth.  The sides provide option depending on whether you feel like southern cuisine or not.    The service is outstanding. Attentive and responsive. Great recommendations. Whether you sit at the bar or in a booth.    They stock great beers and bourbons. What more could you ask?  Friendly patrons. Comfortable atmosphere.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place met my southern expectations! I had the bbq pork sandwich with slaw and bacon wrapped jalapeños, my girlfriend had the roadhouse burger and fries! Plenty of fries to share for the both of us. Lorilee was our outstanding server, she was very attentive! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service, decor, value, presentation, and taste are all 5 stars. My only regret is that I can't find bbq like this on the west coast."}
{"text":"Food is usually really good, but service isn't fantastic, especially if you're doing takeout. The hostesses here always seem to lack customer service skills, and will stand idly and chat after hastily pointing you in the direction of the bar if you have a takeout order. Then you have to stand at the crowded bar hoping to eventually get noticed so you can get your food, which usually takes around 10 minutes. The bartenders are too busy to be managing takeout orders on top of everything else, and it seems especially absurd when you keep looking back at two hostesses who aren't doing anything and aren't even paying attention to what's going on around them. Portions here also tend to be small for the price. All in, it's good BBQ, but I don't know if I'll keep going out of my way to come here - between the service and the portion sizes, you can probably find better value elsewhere in CLT.  PS: parking is generally a nightmare, just be prepared."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying it's really hard for me to place a 1 star yelp! I also believe you call and talk to the manager and hopefully they will correct issue before it has to go to this....now with that being said I placed an order and the food quality on one of the items was really bad! All the other items were great and other times the order was on point. When I called an talked to the manager I was hung up on once and then I called back. Christine got in the phone and I was told that it was my fault and postmates fault for not being specific about the order. I wasn't aware that you have to ask for postmates to tell the vendor to give quality food. The manager was defensive immediately and didn't listen. She just needs some help with management 101 that's all. I won't judge this company based on this interaction and will try again but Christine needs some coaching and I hope she gets it from this yelp. It's sounded busy and I'm sure that got to her but once again she just needs coaching on how to handle difficult situations."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I have had in my entire life.  I will be a regular customer from this day forward."}
{"text":"Visiting NC just for a night. Was lucky this place was highly recommended. The food was great as well a s the service. We had ribs and burnt tips. Everything was delicious. Server and staff were attentive and very friendly. Although I don't condone this... My sister got caught trying to make off with a souvenir beer glass (not cool) nonetheless one of the staff. Handed her a clean one. I've been around the world a thousand times. I love good bbq when stateside and this place surely impressed me enough to give a shout out on yelp."}
{"text":"This was my first stop in Charlotte .. The food was extremely tasty, but even better than that, the service was first rate. Our waitress (whose name I wish I remembered) was extremely prompt & courteous with a great sense of humour. Our drinks never got below half empty because she was always just close enough nearby to provide excellent service, without hovering. I highly recommend the \"burnt ends\" which are not burnt at all, but perfectly cooked to be nice and crispy on the outside whole being tender & juicy on the inside. This will definitely become part of my regular rotation of great barbecue joints in Charlotte. The hush puppies were also fantastic; very well done with just the right amount of crunchy while bursting with flavour. They offer many different regional styles of barbecue, so you're almost guaranteed to find something you'll love. Excellent portion sizes, also. I tried my darnedest, but could not clean my plate."}
{"text":"My husband and I totally love this place and crave it constantly. I feel like it's a sin when ribs are dried out and Midwood has never committed this sin when I visited. Always tender ribs. And there are some Seriously fabulous combination platters."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Some of the best BBQ I've had in Charlotte. You have to try the loaded fries with pork appetizer. Also great beer specials!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best place! Definitely recommend it as one of the best places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"What can I say about Mildwood Smokehouse other than it is the best BBQ I have ever had. Period. Seriously, we had ribs and brisket... best ribs... best brisket. If you like BBQ and happen to be in NC, come here now. That's all.  PS: The pecan dessert was also amazing and I don't even care for pecans."}
{"text":"Another great barbecue joint in Charlotte.  We started off with the fried pickles and bacon wrapped jalepeno's.  The jalepeno's were excellent, full of smokey flavor and cooked just right.  The fried pickles were ok, nothing special though.  I personally like when the pickles are cut thick and these are pretty thin and greasy.  I shared the combo plate and it was good that I did as the portions are crazy big.  I tried the pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chopped chicken.  All were really good, my favorite was probably the pulled pork.  The brisket isn't quite as good as Sauceman's but it definitely holds its own.  As for the sides, we had macaroni, collards, and hush puppies.  All were great as well.  If you're looking for a great barbecue spot, look no further."}
{"text":"Great smoke house dishes such as ribs, brisket tips, and chicken. Sides such as bacon wrapped jalepenos and hush puppies are filled with flavor. Desserts are large and delicious such as pecan cobbler with ice cream. Noisy family style, no pretense, just great food."}
{"text":"The Banana pudding was so good I had to get two additional ones To go to give my sister. We tried the brisket, pulled PORK, ribs, beef ends I forgot what they were called and Mac n cheese with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was outstanding. First of all, no country music which is a huge plus! Rock n roll music that was excellent. Next the food: our server, Iimane, suggested the well-fed combo platter which includes your choice of 4 meats and 2 sides for $24. We chose the burnt ends ($2 extra), the brisket, pulled pork and chicken. For sides, the mac n cheese and the bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers. So, the burnt ends were delicious chunks of brisket bathed in BBQ sauce and they were tasty. The pork was lightly covered in vinegar sauce, white meat chicken comes plain so you can choose any of their 4-5 sauces. The mac n cheese is homemade and the poppers are hot and spicy, so good.  Service, food, music and atmosphere was all excellent so I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We wanted some southern BBQ, this place delivered and then some.  Gotta be the best in the area."}
{"text":"Had a few dates here a few years ago.  Food was ALWAYS good and wait staff as well."}
{"text":"Sadly this restaurant did not live up to the expectation set by the original.   We went last weekend with a couple of out of town friends and everything started off well. I had called ahead to make sure if there was a wait it was reasonable and when we showed up we were taken straight to a table. Great since we were starving! Almost immediately we put an order in for the cheese fries with brisket. The fries came out after we had ordered our mains and several of the fries were burnt.   Moving on to our mains I had ordered the big plate of lean brisket and a friend had ordered the half lean half fatty. When the waiter was handing me my plate I asked to verify that he was handing me the lean and not the mix (since my friend and I had the same sides). He said it looked like the mix so my friend and I swapped plates. Halfway through the meal we realized it was right the first time so we traded strips of lean and fatty. However I wasn't super invested in getting any more brisket since the strips I already had were dry and unimpressive. The brisket at the original location is one of my favorite meals in Charlotte.   Overall it was a fine experience but as other reviewers have mentioned it felt more like a chain than a delicious and authentic NC BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Good service, pretty good BBQ.  Really enjoyed the crowd during a Panthers game.  If you're in the area, give it a try but it's not distinguishable enough from other smokehouses around Charlotte to travel out of your way here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to spots. Service is always great and friendly, the food and barbecue is delicious. I love the salmon salad. The location and atmosphere is pretty great too. Must try for charlotte BBQ"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here and for the most part we had an excellent experience mostly due to CJ, our outstanding waiter.  We started with the bacon-wrapped jalapeños which I thought were very tasty but not as hot as I had expected. I had the small Chicken BBQ plate which was outstanding, and a side of the collard greens which were very good. My girlfriend had the half-rack of ribs and said they were perfect and falling off the bone and a side of mac & cheese. My 3yr old got the sloppy joe this time but only ate the fries. I ate his bun and have to say it was much improved over the last time I ate here. My mom had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and my dad had the classic pulled pork and they both said their dishes were delicious. The pink lemonade was great and the pecan cobbler we shared was out of this world.  We arrived a bit later than expected and couldn't eat in a booth do we ate in the heated outdoor area. It was nice and warm and almost empty but became the spillover area for the bar which is what caused it to loose a star. Other than that it was great. I would definitely eat here again but I would shoot to arrive an hour earlier before the bar crowd arrives."}
{"text":"Having reintroduced pork into my diet, I couldn't wait to try out Midwood Smokehouse. A couple of friends and I went over there on a Saturday night, and due to the lovely weather which allowed the patios (yes, there are two - one upstairs and one downstairs) to be open, we only had a 15 minute wait. We sat at the bar and discussed the food options with the bar tender. By the time we sat down we were all ready to order.  We started with a basket of hush puppies because this is a BBQ joint - you have to start with hush puppies. And they did not disappoint. Dipped in the delicious BBQ sauce with a nice outside crunch and soft interior. Delish.   I ordered the small pork platter with mac-and-cheese (once again because it's a BBQ joint and you've got to have some mac-and-cheese). Good thing I ordered the small! There was enough food on my plate to feed at least two, possibly three, people. And more hush puppies on the side. The pork was so delicious with the spicy BBQ sauce that I barely tapped into the mac-and-cheese and didn't even touch the extra hush puppies.   Service was quick and efficient, and we never got to the bottom of our drink glasses. Parking can be a bit tricky as the lot is small and the place seems to always be hopping, but that will not deter me. I will definitely be back for more, Midwood. And soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for BBQ with a nice staff, good atmosphere and a chain kind of feel this is the place. Let me explain- I'm used to BBQ places that are a bit less clean, styrofoam cups, white bread, etc... This place had great BBQ with a Longhorn steakhouse kind of feel. Was very clean, manager stopped by twice to make sure we were ok and our server was awesome.  Get the Pimento Cheese Fries- you won't be sorry...   Really good stop for me and the family. We will be back next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised today when I stumbled upon this place.  My mother and I ordered his 2 sandwiches I had the Carolina styled and my mother ordered the brisket with cheese and she enjoyed it as well. The service however wasn't the best it was slow however the food was the selling point. I will go back soon"}
{"text":"We ate here for my fiance's birthday dinner. He loves barbeque and I wanted to come to this location instead of the original in Plaza Midwood so that our family and friends joining us wouldn't have such a dreadful parking experience. The parking lot was actually pretty busy, but it was restaurant week so I'm sure that contributed to it.   The service we received when I called to make our reservation was absolutely above and beyond. Normally you call a restaurant they ask for how many people are attending and what time and that's it. Midwood Smokehouse asked if we would like to use their private dining room for the birthday gathering, if we had any and all accommodations for elders, babies,  allergies, and if we would be bringing a birthday cake.   The services we received when we arrived matched the host to a T. They were so attentive with every question we asked and the services that we needed.   Of course, I cannot leave out the best part, the FOOD! I ordered the brisket and when the waiter put my food down in front of me I asked if I could have a knife and different waitress said \"Oh you shouldn't need a knife and if you do our kitchen staff will be fired.\" SHE WAS RIGHT! The brisket was so tender and beyond delicious. I had the hush puppies and baked beans, they were both absolutely perfect.   We will definitely be back for both the lovely staff and great food."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is a welcome addition to the Charlotte BBQ scene. Located in the ever burgeoning Plaza-Midwood neighborhood, Midwood delivers on the 'Q while at the same time adding modern flair with dishes like smoked vegetable bruschetta, smoked turkey and sausage and a Cuban sandwich. The pork BBQ was smoky and delicious and I love that they have 4 sauce options to choose from. The mac & cheese was a standout side and the hush puppies were tasty too. I look forward to going back to try the ribs, the pimento cheese fries and the desserts."}
{"text":"What can I start of with but one the best meals I have ever had! They give out high portions. For an appetizer I got the smoke wings. Let me say this I love them. Amazing literally smoked wings. I could not have asked for a better app. I am so used to Buffalo wings since I am the city over from the original chicken wing; that I figured I try. Yup best choice ever. For the meal I got pulled pork and Mac and cheese (small). That was the most delicious meal ever. The place is pretty cool and they have TVs all over the place. Definitely come here for some BBQ. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Walked from the stadium for this place. So worth it!!!! Everything is so delicious. Found it on here. We are avid Yelpers when we go out of town anywhere. We are never disappointed. Service  was also great!"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue I've ever had, easily, in my entire life. The pulled pork was my favorite ever, and everything else I tried was on point, especially the burnt ends, which you can get any day of the week. I also tried a bbq salad with green goddess dressing, that was wonderful--hard to accomplish at an amazing bbq joint. We actually ordered take out and the service was great. Everything was packaged well (but sadly, they forgot my ranch) and the woman who helped me over the phone was someone I feel I should try to meet in person so we can be friends. As for the prices, I felt they were priced very fair, especially for the quantity and quality of what we received. Great experience at Midwood and I know we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My favorite meal in Charlotte. Definitely try the combo platter with bacon wrapped jalapeños. The bar has really fantastic choices and $1.50 PBR."}
{"text":"Really average. I was really excited about this place being I live in LA and don't have many chances to eat bbq. I must say it was pretty disappointing. The service was ok and the food was...ok. We tried to order the beef ribs;however, they ran out. I ordered the coleslaw and it was pretty sour. My mom ordered the chicken and it was really dry. I must say the salmon was actually pretty good and my niece and nephews ate all of their food. It is a family friendly restaurant. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I have never been to North Carolina before and when the opportunity presented itself to visit one of the barbeque staples in America, I could not resist. After speaking with a few locals on where the best barbeque was, Midwood Smokehouse was always mentioned. On a peaceful Labor Day afternoon, I called an Uber and directed my driver to this location.  After entering the premises, I was quickly greeted and offered the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. I chose indoor seating given that it was going to rain. My waitress came up to me within a few minutes and asked what I wanted to drink. I settled on the sweet tea, one of the most sought after beverages in the South. I large cup of ice cold sweet tea was brought to my table, and I told. the waitress that I decided on the Well-Fed Combination plate, complete with beef brisket, hickory sausage, ribs, hushpuppies , Carolina chopped pork, and bacon wrapped jalepenos. Unfortunately, they did not have ribs today, so they gave me the option of chicken or doubling up on another meat entrée. Figuring that I should try all the meats, I opted for chopped chicken bbq.   I was dining alone so I spent a few minutes on my phone enjoying sips of the sweet, sugary iced tea. However, within a good seven minutes, my large whopping order presented itself in front of me. The waitress asked if it was my first time and proceeded to explain the different sauces. I was barely listening as I was salivating over the piles of meat. I dug in and fell in love with the brisket. They gave me a mix of both lean and fatty brisket and the combination of both, literally melting in my mouth, was enough for me to keep eating more. No sauces were required for the brisket. The hickory smoked sausage was perfectly grilled with that snap you would expect with any perfectly smoked sausage casing. The pork and chicken were equally tender, but the beef brisket was the star of the meal. All the meats were a wonderful pair to the collard greens, bacon wrapped jalepenos, and hush puppies.  I'm said to say that I am only in North Carolina for a month, but I will definitely be back for brisket!"}
{"text":"The winner here was the pulled pork for me.  I liked the vinegar sauce very much.  The pork was juicy and a little smokey and perfect with their sauce.  The smoked veggies and greens were excellent as were the hush puppies that came with my meal.  The ribs were pretty good.  I ordered them dry, not wet.  I liked the rub.  The ribs were a little overcooked and tough on one end and just short of dry.  Their house red sauce was good and was almost a little much when combined with the ribs.  They're ok.  I didn't like the beans.  They're in tomato or something and a little pasty.  Not my taste.  I liked the place and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Finally got to try it a couple of weeks ago.  They had a special, with burnt ends brisket and rib combo, with cheer wine sauce.  Wasn't a fan of that sauce, but my wife had the standard midwood sauce, and I was able to dip the burnt ends in that and it was a lot better.  The macaroni and cheese was the highlight.  That was really enjoyable.  The beer was ice cold and the server was friendly.  Food came out quick.  I like to eat, but I'll tell you, they give a lot of food in the large portion.  Couldn't finish it.  I'll go back again.  Either way it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place was really nice bigger than I expected. They have an outside seating area a nice bar. The service was good and helpful appetizers really good. I would definitely come back its good bbq in a nice setting in uptown area can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great place! So glad they brought one to Birkdale. Frequent there often, because it's great, and the food comes out super fast. Go to spot when I want to sit down and eat quickly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Brought my family here because Of the good reviews, the food was amazing, I had the burnt ends, everyone's food was really good, the staff is super nice. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Decent pork, good beans, crappy hush puppies. Not a bad place if you live in the neighborhood but I wouldn't tell people to travel here."}
{"text":"Went again this past weekend and I have to recommend their salad of all things. It was packed with delicious fresh veggies (avocado, corn shaved off the cob, tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pepper etc)  and served with amazing dressing and shredded sharp cheddar...just perfect! I also had the grilled cheese with pulled pork which was pretty much delicious too! All of this was graciously served to us without a hitch during late night hours (10:30 ) making us happy and thankful! Our server was super polite and kept the drinks coming (plus they have slushy ice for their drinks woohoo!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ and fantastic service! Would definitely come back for the food (burnt ends, brisket, etc.) and the cocktails (try the tequila jalapeno one). The portions are huge, especially if you get the sampler."}
{"text":"I had a great meal and experience at Midwood--the food was tasty and came out quickly, the service was great, and the beer list was excellent. We had the bacon wrapped jalapenos, burnt ends plate with collard greens, and the special burger (brisket & chuck patty topped with pulled pork and onion straws). Everything we had was great, cooked as ordered, fresh and flavorful. They had a great special on 20 oz draft beers and a well-curated list of local and national beers. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy cheese filled bacon wrapped jalapeño DELICIOUSNESS!   I feel sorry for everyone whose tastebuds haven't danced to the sweet, creamy, smokey, spicy tongue love fest that I have witnessed in this side dish. Yes the hush puppies are crunchy, sweet and nicely spiced.. And yes the brisket is nicely smokes and juicy. But those bacon wrapped jalapeños... Sigh.  #bbq #foodie #baconisbetter #jalapenopopperking"}
{"text":"Best BBQ spot in Charlotte! The pork is unbelievably moist and flavorful and the sauces compliment it well. I've been to most of the spots around Charlotte and although there are other good ones, this is definitely my favorite and the one I take friends and family to when they're in town."}
{"text":"We had a good experience here. Our waitress was fantastic and the food was tasty. My only gripe was that I ordered the half slab of ribs with sweet potato fries and mac & Cheese, and the ribs were a little dry. Still good but I wanted them a little more tender. The mac & cheese noodles were a little under done, I would've liked them a little softer. Great beer menu and the sweet potato fries were delicious, fresh out the fryer like I like them. My husband had the burnt ends, he liked them. We would go back, next time I will try the brisket."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we absolutely loved it. I just had a salad that I was able to make myself and it was delicious. I would highly recommend it and I can't wait to go again. I didn't care for the hush puppies but u don't really need them because everything else is so good"}
{"text":"My son and I flew in from the West Coast for a weekend workout and we wanted some great BBQ--we found the perfect place in this gem!  The food was AWESOME and Rachel and Matt took great care of us. They walked us through the menu, made some great suggestions and pointed out some don't miss items, including the bacon wrapped jalapeños and fried pickles."}
{"text":"This is a great Midwood Smokehouse location. (But shouldn't it officially be called Ballantyne Smokehouse if it's here?) They have all the same offerings that the other location does except in a larger and less densely packed layout. Also seems to not get hit quite as hard as the original Plaza Midwood location. And for out of towners, it makes for the best southern BBQ.  The menu offers everything they've got at the original. Pulled pork and chicken, burnt ends of beef or pork, ribs, brisket and so on. These days I take it easy on the meats and they make that an option with some salads on the menu. Still, their claim to fame is clear. You can get the Well-Fed with 4 different meats chosen from a list of 5 or 6 including beef, pork and chicken. This also includes two sizable sides (collard greens, mayo OR vinegar based slaw, mac and cheese, and the to-die-for bacon wrapped jalapenos, among others) meaning you will end up quite well fed. If you leave hungry or without a to-go box, you messed up somewhere...  The prices aren't bad, especially when you consider the volume and quality of food here. The service I experienced was excellent, especially since I was visiting with a colleague from out of town."}
{"text":"food is better than macs but the space isnt as cool, its actually a little tight in there.  im sure when its cooler and peeps can sit outside its better but it was hot and rainy last night and we were packed in that place like sardines.  their mac'n'cheese is better than macs, AND SO IS THEIR BRISKET, the ribs are better than most in town...  they have a very good beer selection.  GREAT hushpuppies.  great sauces and the chicken was very good as well.  dont bother ordering the wings as they are nothing special, not bad but save your stomach space for other things.  we sat right down and had a very nice server.  i will def be back frequently to try some other stuff and wanted to try the cream cheese brownie but couldnt put another thing in my mouth.  very reasonably priced as well i got the combo \"well-fed\" the smaller one and when they brought it out to me i thought it was the big one that i had seen on other peoples tables, for $16 it was a heck of a deal.  im still going to hit macs up as its good and right down the street from me but this place may have the edge on the bbq hotspots in town...for now"}
{"text":"I was in town for work earlier this week and went here with a friend who lives in town. I really enjoyed it. The burnt ends were tender on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside, covered in a BBQ sauce with a kick. I ordered the small portion and it was more than enough. The hush puppies were light and airy. The mac and cheese was the only thing that didn't really stand out. The pecan cobbler was a home run. Do not attempt to eat it on your own. I did, and I failed miserably. It is sweet, warm with a maple syrupy type sauce that leaves you yearning for fall to get here already! The vanilla ice cream on top is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"We are barbecue lovers but only eat it occasionally out of respect for healthy choices. The reviews on this restaurant looked inspiring, so with no other recommendations than Yelp and on a whim, here we come! It was very crowded, which is always a good sign, we check in and are told it is a 15-30 min wait. Not bad for a weekend in Charlotte. We are asked for a phone number so they can text when our table is ready. We wait, and we wait, and we wait. Parties come and are seated and after a reasonable time, we approach the hostess... OH she says, somehow the communication with our phone number didn't work but we can be seated immediately! In honor of the World Series, Strike One! Server eventually gets to us, we communicate the mixup about being seated and how ravenous we are, and order everything (drinks and food) immediately. She put a rush on it - it all comes out within 5 minutes. That's a Double Hit! Barbecue flavor is good, I will return, but probably to a different location in Charlotte -- Single Hit. Cost of the meal -- here's the problem .....  Its a crying shame when a restaurant feels like their food is SO good they can charge OUTRAGEOUS prices, seat you at a table when you needle them to, impress you with how quickly they can serve you, and NEVER attempt to make it up to you any other way. Friends, that is an OUT! Hence, two stars and I may return --- one day."}
{"text":"Sat at bar at 6pm on a wet Monday and ate a wonderful, massive, caveman like  full slab. Barman was great. Does exactly what you want it to do."}
{"text":"We used to live near the Midwood Smokehouse off Central.  They had good food but we didn't frequent this location too much.  We decided to check out the new Midwood in the Backlot of Park Road shopping center.  Man this place is a Gem.  We ordered a bottle of wine (I know weird for a BBQ place) and the bacon wrapped jalapeños and brisket pimento cheese fries.  The food came out quick and was incredible.  The highlight was our server JP.  He always checked up on us and made us feel welcome.  This guy is a professional and gives you service expected from high end restaurants.  Ask for him when you visit.  We will be back.    Ps.  The drink specials are on point (see photos)"}
{"text":"Before you get mad at me for leaving only two stars, hear me out.  I'm grading on the one experience.  I'm a firm believer in 2nd and even 3rd chances for neighborhood foodie spots.  We live in Elizabeth so this was a nice walk and very convenient.  I was impressed with the resume of restaurants from the owners and have some favorite menu items at Paco's and Cantina... so I was eager to try this one.  Service gets an A.  Kimberly was tending bar and was on top of her game.  Bubbly personality and very attentive to all of the patrons at the bar.  My wife immediately was impressed and she had the wow factor that a good bartender needs.  Remembered names, what we were drinking and above all, extremely friendly.  The other gentleman at the bar was less on his game and seemed stressed by the job and was forgetful with requests from patrons on our half of the bar.  Draft beers were upwards of $5-$6 per pint and the liquor drinks were $7-$10 per drink.  A bit high but trending standard fare for the neighborhood bars these days.  We ordered the smoked wings which were okay... Not very meaty for wings but had good smokey flavor.  Sauce options were sides which was different but still good.  We had the South Carolina style BBQ sauce which was actually more like a honey mustard.    We each had two drinks and shared the wing app at the bar.  Total bill w/ 20% tip was right at $40.    I'm hoping the other reviews on right on the pork.  Our next round we will go with an entree.  We would tend to head to Mac's for this but we want to support the local Plaza Midwood area."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, was not that impressed with the BBQ. Maybe I'm picky about it growing up eating Lexington BBQ.  My boyfriend and I shared the well fed platter where we got pulled pork, smoked chicken, ribs and brisket. Our two sides were mac and cheese and collard greens. The BBQ was a little too smoky flavored for me and the chicken was very bland. I did like their sauces though. The mac and cheese and collard greens were both great. I will say if you're going with someone else, the platter is the way to go. That way you get to try a little of everything. We also started with the hogapeno dip and bbq queso. Neither were anything exceptional.   They were slammed on a Sunday night so we had to wait for a little bit. Rachel took great care of us, and kept checking back to see when more burnt ends would be done since they were out when we arrived. The manager on duty was very active on the floor and visited our table almost as much as our server. You could tell she was constantly helping the servers out and checking on tables.   They had some sandwiches and burgers that looked really good, and I would go that route next time. They also have a great beer list although I didn't partake on this particular visit.   I thought overall the price of everything was high. One small portion of meat and a side for upwards of $11? There are many places you can get a lot more for your money and its just as good if not better."}
{"text":"I like Midwood, so I took my visiting Parentals. It ended up being a marginal visit. The good food saved a rather 'meh' experience.  The waiter started off very knowledgeable about the beer selection and then the service sort of dropped off from there... Having to ask several times for ice water and a specifically requested sauce is frustrating.  My parents definitely enjoyed their meals. I'm pretty sure they would return, just with hopes of better service."}
{"text":"This was fantastic. I had the burnt tips with mac n cheese as my choice side and my fiancé had the pulled pork sandwich with bacon wrapped jalapeños. A few pieces of brisket were more like large chunks of your usual brisket, though most were exactly what I expected - caramelized flavors, chewy textured awesomeness. Mac and cheese was good but not amazing. The plate came wish hush puppies too. Those were small, but yummy. My fiancé liked his sandwich but I wasn't as much of a fan. His jalapeños were good...but not amazing. Great craft beer selection. Definitely coming back! They had smoked salmon on the menu that sounded delish."}
{"text":"A good barbeque spot in Charlotte located just outside the downtown. I had one of their salads with brisket which was pretty good. I also had tastes of the ribs and pork which were also pretty good. The place wont blow you away but overall worth checking out if your looking for good barbeque at a good price."}
{"text":"I will definitely say that I am a fan of the place, but a lot of that has to do with the fact that they are close by - certainly much closer than Bill Spoon's or McKoy's, and definitely closer than Bubba's.  But does that mean that they are the best?  I am not going to go that far at this point.  The crowd can be a bit nuts.  Even outside of your normal dining \"rush hour\".  The good news is that it moves pretty quickly.  We waited 10-15 minutes for a table for four.  What really causes issues is that the service is a bit slow.  If that would pick up, it would probably move a bit faster still (even though it is not really that bad).  When you talk about the food, you naturally talk about the meat, since that is their specialty, right?  While it is good, it is not great.  There are some interesting dishes here, like the queso with barbecue.  Unfortunately, it is a plate of melted cheese and some small flecks of meat thrown on top.  Very disappointing.  Would have been so much better if it was all mixed together.  When you get to your entree, things look up - but ultimately it is again not stellar.  Looks like I will be making a drive after all."}
{"text":"Best smokehouse I have ever been to. The spicy BBQ sauce is so good on their smoked pulled pork sandwich and the Mac n cheese is amazing. Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Delicious, but not the best BBQ I've ever had. They definitely have some of the best brisket in Charlotte, but that's not saying too much. Their portions are adequate and the price is decent. Their sauces are pretty good. I like their North Carolina BBQ sauce.   It's no Texas BBQ joint, but it's decent."}
{"text":"Brisket, brisket, brisket! And bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers!! Honestly, this place isn't really my first preference (I think twice about eating here even if I'm right across from this place) because I'm not a fan of barbecue and almost everything I eat here makes me feel guilty about introducing my body to so much grease and fat. But my boyfriend is crazy about this place and so I eat here more often than I otherwise would. In fact if it wasn't for him, I probably would have never been here. But when I do eat, I enjoy my meal.  Their brisket (as I chanted before) is really good. You can get it lean or fatty. Of course I pick lean. And my meal is never complete without the fried mac-n-cheese and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers on the side. The hushpuppies are pretty good too. My boyfriend also loved the burnt ends (I haven't tried those, but I trust his opinion) and pulled pork. I'm not a big fan of their seating. I don't know what it is, but I'm always uncomfortable here. The metal chairs and tables aren't the most comfortable, and patio seating is a little tight."}
{"text":"Got the half rack of ribs in the spicy BBQ sauce and they were good. Not dry at all. Pickled onions are great with it too. Got the macaroni as a side item. Overall, food was pretty good. Service was a little slow but we did go there the first month they were open."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday. My fiancé said they had the best bloody marys! I got beef brisket. I love how you can choose fatty or lean. I got fatty and it was so tender and juicy. Macaroni was also good. I would definitely come here again. Staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"This is how brisket is supposed to be. Tender, flavorful, everything just right. I've had some great BBQ in my life but the brisket here puts them all to shame.  I enjoyed just about everything I tried from the mac & cheese to the hush puppies.  About the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the sausage. It was good, but not great.  Excellent service, decent prices. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"In town for the night so stoped here for som BBQ.  The special was the pork belly burnt ends.  They were melt in your mouth good.  We choose the Mac and cheese side, and it was very rich. The hush puppies were just okay.    The brisket salad had lots of veggies.  I wish I had room for desert, but I was so full from everything else."}
{"text":"BBQ was ok, sides good, service fantastic!    Started with the queso app with pork.  Queso was good but pork was unnecessary.  The pork made the dish tougher to eat.  Then had the full Carolina pork with collard greens and mac and cheese. The portion of pork was substantial. It wasn't dried out but there was minimal amount of bark/smoke in it. The east Carolina vinegar sauce was really mild, not nearly as strong as others. Collard greens were best dish of the meal.  Mac and cheese was typical baked southern style.  Service was fantastic. Sat at the bar and was promptly served. Food came out as fast as possible.  Refilled drink regularly.  Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Went to Midwood Smokehouse with the family on Friday afternoon. The place was busy before 5:00; good sign. Full disclosure, I'm vegetarian, so the meat reviews are second hand from my meatetarian husband.  He had a three-meat combo plater of ribs, brisket, and turkey. He said it was the best brisket he'd had in his life...and that's a long time. LOL. I had a three sides combo of mac and cheese, coleslaw, and smoked veggies. All very yummy. We started with hush puppies and the surprisingly tasty, but artery clogging, pimiento cheese fries. Our server was helpful and friendly, too. We'll definitely go back to Midwood Smokehouse!"}
{"text":"Now this is real southern bbq.   I'm here visiting from NY, and wanted to find that genuine bbq experience.  I don't need to look any further than this place.    When you walk in, you'll be amazed at how big this place is.  Super clean, lots of seating and a large bar.  The decor is pretty neat- bbq themed stuff (check out the ladies room- you will crack up!) also, according to my husband, slave leia from Star Wars is hanging in the men's room which is AWESOME.    Now let's get to the most important part- THE FOOD.  We ended up getting the combo platter and selected the largest portion they offer which is called \"pig out\".   You get to chose 4 proteins so we did the Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, pulled chicken bbq, and the saint Louis style pork ribs.  You also get a side of hush puppies with it and a It choice of two sides.   We obviously picked the mac n cheese because who doesn't love that?  The other side was the bacon wrapped jalapeños.  I also ordered the smoked vegetables on the side because those sounded interesting.   (Try the tangy mustard sauce, I put that on the chicken and was not disappointed at all).  EVERYTHING we ate was fantastic.    The manager came over to us to say hello and also explained that the hickory wood is locally sourced, they don't use a gas smoker- This is the real thing here.   We initially planned on wrapping half of our food for leftovers but we cleared our plates.    I would be doing this place an injustice if I didn't brag about the whiskey and bourbon menu.  What's bbq without a good whisky on the side?   It is pretty expansive with plenty of options to chose from.  You can also pick your own flight!    Our waitress Erin was a doll.  She went over the entire menu with us and was very knowledgeable and kind.  Overall we were extremely impressed.  We will be coming back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"This BBQ was great their special was a Bbq french dip WOW it was a beef brisket smoked perfectly . The cheese an au jus mouth watering. Only thing I was disappointed on was their Mac n cheese an im finding this a lot lately. It was that power mix cheese an than they just mix it with the noddles an bake it YUCK!! I'm a southern girl I know my Mac n cheese of its on the menu it needs to be real or just add a side that you do know how to make.  I'm surely goin back one friend didn't care for it but didn't try the brisket she said she wants to try it again. Check it out minus the Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"The burnt ends, brisket, hush puppies, and banana pudding are all really good. The pork, mac-n-cheese, and their sauces are just good.  Probably deserves 4.5 stars.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave Midwood another try! I prefer this location to the one on Central Ave. The restaurant was busy for a weeknight and our food was served quickly. We shared the queso with brisket and each ordered a pulled pork dinner. I also ordered the macncheese and creamed corn because I can't help myself at BBQ places. Shh, this is a secret but it's about the sides. The pork was smoky and flavorful even without sauce. We were given several sauces so we were able to decide if we wanted our BBQ with sauce or without. I wouldn't recommend the creamed corn; it was more creamed sauce than corn. Not my favorite. The fries and coleslaw were good, though. I mean how can you go wrong with crinkle fries? I would gladly eat here again. The portions are generous and I took enough home to eat lunch the next day. Give them a go!"}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about Midwood. It's a cool place and I was looking forward to it based on reviews. I was given a gift card which I wanted to use but I didn't know Bad Daddy's and Midwood were no longer connected. So beware. It ended up being more expensive than I would've like to pay. $50+ tax for one plate of BBQ, one salmon, wings and a drink. The wings were good; I'd recommend those. All flats is extra. I ordered the brisket ends with fries and coleslaw plus a side of pulled pork. They don't do combo platters but sides of meat for $3-4 extra. My plate ended up being $22.50. Yikes. The brisket ends were kind of fatty, the pulled pork comes without sauce, crinkle fries were ok, hush puppies were good and coleslaw was plentiful. I ordered the honey/moonshine/tea cocktail. It was good; something I'd recreate at home. I'm not sure why other reviewers are so in love with Midwood. Maybe I just miss the sauce."}
{"text":"Great barbeque, sides are ok, A little pricey"}
{"text":"I am used to the Midwood Smokehouse location in Plaza Midwood. I had always been so happy with the meals there. So maybe my expectations were too high going into this park road location. Speaking of location- it's a great location! We had a fantastic server and kind hostess. Good beer. Bad news is... the food was just not good. We did go around 8pm. I just loved their chicken and i was so disappointed because it was very dry. The ribs were not a hot temperature but more Luke warm. The bacon wrapped jalepenos were soggy and the corn pudding needed some salt. Perhaps this was an off night... but I'm willing to try again based off of what I know the plaza Midwood location to be!"}
{"text":"We had Midwood Smokehouose cater a work event for 25 visitors coming in from Japan and also the office staff. We wanted to give the visitors some real Southern American food. First of all, they all loved the food and thanked us incessantly.   We purchased the grilled chicken, roasted summer vegetables, potato salad, and banana pudding. Everythinng was excellent! The chicken was really moist and had a rich smoky flavor. The veggies were fresh and crunchy. The potato salad was creamy and tasted like they had just made it. The banana pudding may have been the best one I have ever tried. I am guessing they make it with condensed milk and cream cheese and fold in the whipped cream to give it that airy feeling.   We also ordered regular and sweet tea. They brought us sliced lemons which was a lovely touch. They also provided serving utensils and flatware.   I will definitely be visiting in person. I also want to comment on the wonderful presentation that the caterer gave us. It looked very nice for a professional event. Also, the ease of the ordering was appreciated as well as the reasonable prices. Thanks Midwood!"}
{"text":"This is is best CAROLINA pulled pork barbq in Charlotte! Their baked beans have barbq in them. Sooo good! Great location."}
{"text":"The pork barbq plate with Midwood sauce was outstanding. Hub said the jalapeño bacon wrap side was excellent. Banana pudding was very good."}
{"text":"Drove by and decided to have dinner there.  Ordered the regular size sampler and it was enough of meal for me and two ladies.  Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad in The Smokehouse overpriced that's for sure the taste is good some days are not so hot on the taste that is sometimes the spare ribs is not good but sandwich that is cool brisket is delicious I have had a bad one but most of the time they're good not worth the price for a sandwich over $10 is a little expensive however they did have a sale for $8 and some change that was better I mean meet sampler platter they charging you against by the pound for sausage a piece of chicken and some brisket the price is ridiculously high do you think that you eating Prime cutting meat that came and poured it I would never spend $24.99 for a sample platter there's not nothing much enough for two but if you like to eat it's not enough for two one and a half person just saying that's just starting price $24.99 and up"}
{"text":"Good quality meat and great service.  Our group had the brisket, salmon, st Louis style ribs, and burnt ends.  I was hoping for the burnt ends to be a bit more tender and juicy, but overall still a great meal. I loved the ribs and wish I got the full rack."}
{"text":"For openers, if you believe the best barbecue is usually found in a bad part of town in a place with bars on the windows and just enough grease on the table to write your intials, then this isn't it.  If, on the other hand, you think good barbecue can be found in a funky part of town, with tons of other places to eat in every direction, then Midwood BBQ may be for you.  Actually, I suggest calling it Midwood BBBBQ... this is another of those places that has grown to the point that it's a Big Bucks BBQ place complete with a real people bar and more televisions than needed, much less appreciated.  Parking is yet another issue and don't be surprised if there's a wait.  For someone who has spent a lifetime in search of the perfect barbecue, Midtown has several things going for it, but, in reality it's a big sports bar that has some decent barbecue.  Let's start with the service and the décor: folks are there to greet and seat you when you come through the door, a smiling face to who quickly takes your drink order, clean tables with the now-it's-almost required rolls of paper towel, a beer signs from brews gone by, photos from Charlotte's earlier days and at least one television per wall in the bar and in the main dining room. There's also some sidewalk tables.  We opted for a couple of their better known appetizers, fried pickles and bacon wrapped jalapenos, a half dozen bucks. And that's the first rub...   the bacon wrapped Jalapenos were at the highlight of the entire meal, followed by the Hush Puppies and then a tie between the souped up baked beans and the Mac n Cheese - and when the sides outshine the protein offerings there's a problem.  That's not the way it's supposed to be.  The situation is reversed at most barbecue joints: the meats get all the attention and the sides, all too often, come out of a can or the freezer. Not so at Midwood's Smokehouse... and for the real barbecue zealot there for low and slow cooked meats, too many TVs, beer choices and sides can be a distraction.  The ribs, as a for instance, literally fell off the bone. Why?  Were they parboiled, or baked, and then tossed on the grill?  Steamed (to tenderize) before they were served? If any of the aforementioned, that's not low and slow over a bed of smoldering wood.  That's cheating.     To give credit where due, the brisket was exceptional... just enough fat left to provide real good (and moist) flavor. And the pulled pork was almost as good and served in the same generous portion.  The chicken was on the dry side.  For the Brown Shoe Gourmet's taste, their homemade sauce (smoky and sweet) worked best. An alien at the table preferred the vinegar based which brings up another point: this is a North Carolina barbecue joint that shows more of a leaning to Texas 'cue than Carolina style... the brisket, the jalapenos being good examples.  For a guy who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue (read more than 70 other barbecue reviews), this certainly isn't it... but it's fairly good with some exceptional sides, friendly folks and exceptional service.  Worth the effort if you can find parking, worth the effort if there's a game you want to see, a specific beer you've a thirst for, and are up for some fair to middlin' 'cue."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place out after passing by it so many times on the way to Plaza shopping and bars.  We split a large pulled pork plate and a small chopped salad.  The pulled pork comes with the vinegar based sauce, but we were lucky they forgot to pour it on top so they put it on the side, and since it was my first time there, I asked to try out their other sauces.  I preferred their Midwood signature, which was sweet and smokey, over the NC vinegar, but to each their own.  The pork itself was just ok, as I've had better and I've had worse.    Now to the sides.  We tried the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the bbq baked beans.  The jalapenos were good with cheese inside, but the bacon was just too fatty as it was all baked together and didn't cook enough.  I was also wary of the baked beans since I know many places who just open up a can and serve.  Theirs were cooked right with some pieces of meat in it, making it very tasty.  I would definitely recommend the beans to any barbecue fan.  Overall, the service was pretty good, as our server was keen to help us with the menu and seemed knowledgeable.  We came at an off-hour during the week, so I can't speak to the crowds here, but I can see an issue if the cramped parking lot that writhes around the building gets packed.  Will come back to try their other entrees and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Huffington Post wrote an article of 15 reasons why Charlotte is the weirdest and #13 was the city's reaction to Michelle Obama's compliment to their BBQ. Charlotte said, \"Our BBQ is just okay\". And that's exactly how I felt about my pulled pork. Not much flavor, it just existed. I didn't see any big deal for the hush puppies either, are they supposed to be dry? The winners of the night were definitely the collard greens and bacon wrapped jalapeños. Our server was friendly and the ambience was chill, we sat outside in their covered space."}
{"text":"great BBQ shack, good beer.. and CHEERWINE!!!! so good, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Still consistently the best BBQ I've tasted.  Whenever someone comes to visit, we always take them here, it's a hit everytime. The takeout option is always the best option when it's busy.  We ordered from here on a busy Saturday night recently and it was 20 minutes from the time we ordered the food until it was time for pickup.  I waltzed in, bypassed all the folks waiting for talbes, went to the Take-Out area on the right of bar,  paid, and walked out with my food.  It took longer for me to park than it did to get the food.  This is a staple in the \"list of restaurants to take guests to\".  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Tasty BBQ, great service, good for large groups, good beer selection."}
{"text":"Great BBQ -smokehouse. Lots of choices and combos. Moderately priced.  Great service too. Several locations around Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ton of food. ..All delicious!  I went with the tacos. I liked the tacos but could have easily been satisfied with just the side dishes.  Mac and cheese & creamed corn were awesome. Large place. Kid friendly. Outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"Midwood was good for the most part. I absolutely loved the mac and cheese, baked beans and brisket. If I go back, those are likely the items I would order. They were really good! I ordered a four meat choice sampler, but was told that they were out of ribs. One star docked for that. BBQ places cannot run out of ribs!!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue in Charlotte, by far! The Carolina barbecue is to die for. They have wonderful sides also, the bacon wrapped jalapeños dipped in ranch are unbelievable. The service here is pretty good, nothing to rant about, but not much to compliment either. My sister does not eat pork and their are always chicken options available. Overall a good place, it is is the barbecue that make it worthy of five stars."}
{"text":"Was finally able to stop in at Midwood today for lunch, and I was very impressed. Definitely the best BBQ I've found in Charlotte so far. I ordered the large plate of pulled chicken in mustard sauce with bacon wrapped jalapenos and pimiento cheese fries as my sides. The pulled chicken was very tender, and the mustard sauce was decent. I also got some of Midwood's habanero BBQ sauce on the side, and this put the chicken over the top to amazing! That sauce is the bomb! Not too spicy, not too vinegary, and not too sweet- just a perfect balance.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos were amazing. Extremely smoky, great bacon flavor, a little cheese to balance everything out, and spice from the jalapeno. I was able to have pimiento cheese fries as my other side for a $1 upcharge and they were good as well but not great. My girlfriend ordered sweet potato fries, and they were awesome! I would honestly rather have the plain sweet potato fries than the pimiento cheese fries (but I love sweet potato fries so I am biased). She also had the Cuban sandwich which was good but not amazing in my opinion. The hush puppies that came with the BBQ plate weren't bad but just average.  Our server was friendly, the atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice (although there is a slight smoky smell inside as any good BBQ place should have so keep that in mind), and the prices were great for the amount of food."}
{"text":"Well, color me impressed. Midwood Smokehouse was really, really good! It's sitting at a 4.5 stars for me right now, but I imagine it will jump to 5 in no time.   Not that I'm surprised, frankly...because Frank Scibelli seems to have the magical touch when it comes to delicious and well-formulated restos in Charlotte. It's a great location (parking can be tricky) with wonderful, friendly service and tons of tasty items on the menu. Here are just a few things I tasted...  1) Pork platter: 4.5/5: Succulent, tender and delightful. This pork platter rivals Mac's, in my opinion. The meat is very smokey - due to the fabulous smoker they purchased for this establishment. But it's a good kind of smoke, no Liquid Smoke here.   2) Hush puppies: 4/5: Crispy outside, soft inside and damn good.   3) Sweet potato fries: 3/5: Good fries but paled in comparison to the other decadence on the table.   4) Bacon wrapped jalapenos: 4/5: Not nearly as hot as you'd think but a really flavorful starter. Make sure you eat one that has the bacon all crisped up. No one wants sad, soggy bacon.  5) Queso with barbecue: 4/5: Um, I love queso. I also love pork barbecue. Put them both together and voila! Instant amazing app.   6) Banana pudding: 5/5: Hell to the yeah. Homemade deliciousness. With vanilla wafers. This is the real deal and you must order it. I don't care how full you are.   I have a big ole smokey crush on Midwood Smokehouse. Looking forward to going back and checking out the patio!"}
{"text":"Minus 2 stars for the new menu. No more Redneck tacos? No more smoke sausage plate? 2 of the best things on the menu, gone."}
{"text":"Being a native New Englander with not a ton of exposure to authentic southern style barbecue, this place is a hands down 5 star. I love everything about it from it's simple, traditional menu to the hip ambience. My only regret is not getting the burnt ends, as I thought these were superior to the brisket and pulled pork that I ordered. The hush puppies were amazing."}
{"text":"Holy f-ing sh*t this place is amazing.  Right from walking in I was in heaven with how good it smelled, then when we got our food. Everything was perfect. Our server Tom was a wonderful super friendly and attentive. Everything on the menu looked fantastic. We got the combo plate with everything but the ribs (it was an hour before closing and they're super popular) the sausage was perfect, chopped pork was heavenly, pulled chicken fantastic and the brisket was phenomenal. Mac and cheese is bombdiggity and their hush puppies are 100% my favorite hush puppies ever.  The pecan cobbler WITH ice cream is definitely not to be missed either.  We just moved to the area and this is hands down our favorite place that will be a regular spot for us :)"}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped jalapenos. That's all you need to know. Carry on. I'll wait while you go order them.  By now you should know my rule of thumb when it comes to Charlotte: if Frank Scibelli's name is attached, it's going to be damn good. I love their smoked wings. Usually, I'll get those and a bunch of sides. We already addressed the BWJ. I'm also a huge fan of the smoked veggies and creamed corn. True story: they took the creamed corn off the menu for a hot second and so many people got upset that they had to bring it back. I don't ever order pulled pork anywhere I go, so for me my go to proteins are the ribs and brisket. I just had burnt ends for the first time last week and they were fabulous. This is going to sound random, but the grilled cheese is great here as well.   Pretty good beer selection. You can also order online for pickup. Parking is not great, but there is a lot behind the building as well. Just pay attention to the signs."}
{"text":"nothing here is going to blow your mind, but there is nothing disappointing. This is always my go-to for quick and easy bbq to-go. There are some other places in town that are probably better on the yum-yum-scale, but this is in the neighborhood and it is so solid, love taking friends visiting from outta town here for good carolina barbeque."}
{"text":"Great barbaque, local beers, what else could you ask for.  I met up with a buddy at this place who lives in Charlotte.  Let's jump right to the action kids:  Cool decor, laid back and we sat in the bar area.  It was pretty packed so the food must be good, right?  I started with a Tito's kicking mule.  Great take on an old favorite.  I followed with an Unknown IPA.  Great local beer that starts with a good hoppy bite and a mellow malt finish.  Dinner was bacon wrapped jalepenos, burned ends and cole slaw.  Great smokey flavor tender bits of meat.  Solid service, great food, it's a winner!"}
{"text":"Visited this location yesterday 7/9/17 for my moms bday lunch. We were a group of 6 and though they were busy (1:30) we were seated within 5 minutes. Our server Michael was absolutely the best, he was very polite and also made a few recommendations since it was our 1st time there. Everyone ordered different foods and EVERYTHING was cooked to perfection..the smoked wings were juicy and of good size, the ribs were fall off the bone tender, the chicken that came with the rib combo was moist but the skin was good and crispy. Even the burger was juicy..our sides included collard greens, sweet potato fries, Cole slaw, creamed corn and fries everything was great! They give good portion sizes so you will not leave hungry. I will be back very soon and I hope I'm sitting in Michaels section."}
{"text":"My wife and I were so excited Midwood Smokehouse moved into Birkdale Village. We have already been a handful of times and the food/atmosphere are always good. I love the burnt ends, greens and Mac and cheese. The hush puppies and pulled pork are also delicious."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but I can get better BBQ in LA.  That's embarrassing.  They were out of ribs but the employees were super nice and friendly.  Just sucks that the BBQ food here is mediocre and reminds me of a fast food chain.  Won't be back except for the collard greens maybe."}
{"text":"I'm a brisket condaseur and I have never had brisket like I just did right now at this place. A shout out to our great waiter, Barry. I can't wait to come back and try their philly with brisket meat. My husband had the Cuba and he loved it. We will be returning until they close down (that's if we don't eat all their supply first). Highly, highly, highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here Sunday Night. Parking, as everyone says, is a challenge, but not that bad.   We had just come from spending the whole weekend hiking in Great Smokey Mountains NP, so we were HUNGRY.   Got seated right away, which was a pleasant surprise as they seemed to be very busy.   I got the sampler plate, small version, my wife got a large chicken. And let me just say the meat was excellent. The brisket was one of the best I have had, melting on the tongue, great spice without being too salty, Next time I come I will order like three plates of that. Not to say the pork wasn't excellent as well, I really liked the vinegar heavy NC style on the pork. The ribs, also quite nice. The sausage, well, a little salty, but the mustard dip made up for that in spades. I give this place A+ for food.  I would have liked to see a little more of the vinegar heavy NC style in the dishes. We had been out in Oklahoma for three years, and while the brisket was excellent, in NC I'd like to see it done NC style not Texas Style, and the ribs, were great St Louis style ribs, again, I'd like to see what they'd look like with the awesome NC vinegar marinate the pork used.  My wife's chicken was great as well. Again food fantastic.  Our service was brisk, and why I am not giving five stars. I've worked restaurants before and am pretty sure they were short staffed (despite getting seated right away it is clear they were turning and burning), and our server was a bartender that got a demotion to waitress for the night, and was a little unhappy about it. Service was crisp and efficient, but we got our check dropped before we had a chance to order desert. As we both ordered a lot of meat, I can understand that the server thought we wouldn't have room, but we had been hiking all weekend. The proper forms of service were performed, but it was a bit brisk, and we definitely got the impression that they wanted to turn the table.   Nothing wrong with that on a busy Sunday night, and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone that asked. That brisket was worth coming back for. Though I just can't help but wonder what it would be like with the pork preparation or similar. It is a nine hour drive from Allentown PA, I'll drive down if you make a NC style brisket. JUST TO EAT THAT.  Great restaurant. Was a nice treat after a weekend of hiking. I figured we smelled like campfire smoke anyway, so a smokehouse was the place to go."}
{"text":"We will never go to this racist place again. My husband along with my son waited for over 10  minutes for someone to serve us, no one ever stopped by to even greet us. They weren't even busy, I watched a few tables get sat after us and the servers didn't waste any time going to greet them and taking their drink order. One server walked by us twice and looked at us without saying a word and she wasn't busy bc she was standing around talking to other servers who were waiting for tables. I'm sure if we weren't black they would have greeted us with a smile, but we decided to get up and leave and spend our money elsewhere. I just moved to Charlotte and clearly I don't know the rules about the white and black sides of town and clearly this is for the white people!"}
{"text":"The aroma, music and vibe were excellent, during this very busy lunch time visit.  The food and beer all came out within a reasonable amount of time, and the wait staff were friendly, even those rushed and being trained.  The pulled-pork with super tasty and warm - pink coloured, with a smokey undertone and NOT at all dry. The coleslaw and hush-puppies were a little too sweet for my liking, but each had a good crunch and good texture. Unfortunately I did not get enough BBQ source, (a bigger dish please) nor were they any to taste test on the tables.  The OMB Copper was ably poured by the bar staff and tasted wonderfully fresh and crisp. It could have done with being a fuller pint!  I am looking forward to returning. Easily the best BBQ in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and myself stumbled upon Midwood Smokehouse when we were on our way to our favorite barbque restaurant, He was reluctant to forgo getting to eat at his favorite place but he gave in to me and man alive was we both glad he did. I had the brisket with the Best mac and cheese and he had barbque. Everything was so delicious right down to the tea. We definitely will be returning and bringing our friends. This was one time that him taking the scenic route paid off.  Beth & Kevin Chapman"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat BBQ in Charlotte hands down.  Bring your blind friend, and have them pick out your food by throwing darts at the menu--you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've ever had. Absolutely awesome. We ordered burnt ends and brisket fries. Highly recommended. I also prefer the regular coleslaw over the bbq slaw....lastly, bbq sauces are great!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You'll find great BBQ here. I would definitely go back. My favorite was the Smoked Chicken Wings. I ordered them dry and then was able to try the 3 different sauces. These wings still make my mouth water.   I also ordered the Well-Fed Combo and that was more than enough food. I ordered the Brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken and Pork Ribs. The Pulled Pork and Ribs are not to be missed, full of flavor and moist. The pulled chicken and brisket were both a little dry.   The sauces were also very good, especially the honey-mustard. I ordered the coleslaw and bacon-wrapped jalapenos, both were really good.   I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte hands down. Very busy on nights and weekends so expect a wait. Pulled pork platter is my go to. But the best thing on the menu is the brisket queso...a must try for everyone."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for Midwood after searching far and wide on Yelp for bbq in Charlotte while driving down to Atlanta. The menu is large and boasts several dishes and sides. My friends ordered ribs, pulled pork sandwich, hush puppies and I ordered the pimento fries with pulled pork on to[. Skip the pimento fries because they're basically crinkle fries with toppings. Head dive into any bbq on the menu and wash it down with a whiskey flight or a beer from the beer list. Serving sizes are no joke here so order responsibly."}
{"text":"Midwood has an incredible amount of hype to live up to. Most people that aren't from charlotte are usually heading here for their first bbq fix. I have come here on several occasions and am thoroughly pleased more often than not. Was let down by the brisket on one visit and they could do some work on their mac and cheese. Other than that the place is great. Decent service. Burnt ends are always my go to so I strongly recommend them. Bacon wrapped jalapenos are great as well as pimento cheese fries with pulled pork. Beer selection is full of local craft. And whiskey selection is good too."}
{"text":"Brisket is the best. Stuffed jalapeños great. My favorite BBQ joint in town. Mom loves half rack ribs. Dad really liked philly steak sandwich.  Just try it,  I'd be shocked if you were disappointed."}
{"text":"HOLY HELL was this place good!   Now, I'm a guy born and raised in the deep South and I know my BBQ.   Midwood Smokehouse was RIGHT ON!    For my first visit to this place, I had to try the pulled pork plate.  I got a little of all 4 sauces to see which was my favorite.   All of 'em were good.  Mac and Chz and Collards were excellent too.  Lots and lots of Flavor.  Service was quick and efficient (although we went on a Monday...so things were at a little slower pace).    I most definitely recommend this restaurant for people who love BBQ.  I'm so glad they set up shop in my hood.  I'll be back....of that you can be sure!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good but the service I received during my time here was pretty terrible. Our waitress was very rude to us and made multiple smart comments. I didn't catch her name but she was a loud blonde. Yes I appreciate someone who is friendly and joking a bit but you are also suppose to have a level of professionalism. She also took forever to bring us drinks and refills. A wait is understandable but when I see you joking around at other tables and taking your sweet time, I get impatient.  The poor service here was unfortunate because this place is worthy of 5 stars. The drink selection was pretty good and included some local beers. I went with Wooden Robot's overachiever which was a nice fruity pale ale. For food we got the brisket queso dip which was yummy and I got the pulled pork with bacon wrapped jalepenos and hush puppiesbfor my entree. The pork was fresh and flavorful, just the way I like it. The sides were a nice compliment to the pork as well. My friends did complain that the ribs were dry and to me they did look pretty dry, which is a no go.  Again the food here was good but our server really hurt the experience."}
{"text":"This was the first time we visited here and it was great.  We checked in ahead of time with skip the line thru yelp and it went perfectly  .  The food was great and staff great too.  The queso appetizer was awesome with pulled pork  and brisket was so tender.  In my opinion the creamed corn and Mac and cheese  sides were clean the plate good.  Not a crumb left!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special to report here. The BBQ was ok. The beers on draft were plenty. The service was hit and miss. I have been to much better BBQ joints in Charlotte. Unless you don't have any other choice, and in this town you do, I would pass."}
{"text":"We are new to NC BBQ.  This was a fabulous introduction!   The Brisket was amazing and the burnt ends (brisket) were also just as one would imagine them.  Perfect. Great service and beer. Whats not to love.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had some business to close in south Charlotte a couple weeks back and had a later than desired evening meal.  The first thing that I thought was that it might not be that great because its in a retail shopping plaza. The atmosphere for having bbq should be one step removed from a tin shack, with a ceiling fan stuck on high speed and a dog barking in the background. Well, Midwood is nothing like that, but the interior decor suggests that they are serious about their food.   I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, slaw on top (natch) with crinkle cut fries. Absolutely delicious! I had a couple of beers and a nice chat with some locals across the bar from me. Normally, I write longer reviews, but I only had time to visit once so here are my impressions based on just one visit.  I liked the atmosphere and decor very much. My sandwich was very good, and a good value considering how big it was. The bartender was friendly. And, one of my biggest concerns about any restaurant is cleanliness. Midwood is clean and so is the restroom! That is a good sign that management is on top of things. Based on my one visit, I would recommend Midwood to anyone, and if I am in this part of Charlotte again, I will be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"for memorial day i realized i did not have any barbecues or anything to go to, so i figured i would go to this place with the boyfriend who hates most places that we eat at in charlotte. but he didnt hate this place. this is why:  1. bacon wrapped jalapenos. you can get them as an appetizer or as a side.  2. dollar beer, or two dollar beer. he likes beer. i dont drink alcohol, im also not mormon, but i mean, that sounds super cheap so thats a good thing. apparently other drinks are expensive but what the hell do i know about drink prices?   3. the super awesome food! which we both agree on. the special was a brisket sandwich and it was extremely good.   other reasons why you should eat here: good service, nice people, they have coke and not pepsi (this is crucial people), it is relatively cheap and there are large portions. there is an outdoor area and on a really hot day the inside was nice and cool. the mac and cheese was very delicious as well!   eat here. my boyfriend ate here and said he liked it and so in regular people terms that must mean its phenomenal."}
{"text":"If you want barbeque, make your way to Midwood Smokehouse. Oh goodness, their draft selection is good, and their custom mixed drinks are great. You must try the Back Porch Tea -- it was superb! A true Southern mixed drink that combined sweet tea (that isn't overly sweet) and Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey (and muddled lemon).  We (2 of us) ordered the cheese fries topped with brisket and the combo platter of 4 meats and 2 sides (collard greens and bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños) and that was plenty of food, enough for leftovers that we made into breakfast the next morning.   Absolutely delicious. Oh I can't wait to make my way back here...."}
{"text":"First time to be at this restaurant. Started with the bacon wrapped jalapeños. Fantastic.I did have the brisket with coleslaw small plate. I choose the habanero BBQ sauce to go with  the brisket which turned out to be perfect choice For dessert we had the bourbon apple pie. Wow  Be back soon"}
{"text":"This place insists in disappointing us with their terrible service. It so Saturday at 8.30 PM. The waitress has the gall to tell us that it is \"late\" in a Saturday so they don't have either the drink I want (because they ran out of \"one of the ingredients\") or the food we all want. This place keeps tempting us with good food but pushes us away with consistently bad servers, consistent mismanagement of food inventory and a general feeling of carelessness."}
{"text":"Just love the food. Great service and great food!  Often take guests to dine here and everyone loves their pulled pork sandwiches and sweet potato fries. Will definitely continue to eat here. Take out is always wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit the Charlotte area, I have to stop by Midwood for BBQ. Best North Carolina pulled pork that I've ever had. Had the pleasure of having Rachel as our waitress last night. There isn't a better waitress out there!! She was not only very helpful with recommending certain dishes but she also has the best attitude ever! She really made the dining experience so much fun!!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN the BEST BBQ I have EVER HAD.  Been to Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and had BBQ in all of them. None of those can touch this place.   Even the sides, MAC N CHEESE, BBQ BEANS etc were amazing. I don't understand how anyone can rate this place less than 5 stars. It has RUINED BBQ for me now!   Even our server was quite a jokester. VERY entertaining!   Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"BBQ is an acquired taste and everyone has an opinion. Personally I don't care if it comes from the Carolinas, Memphis, Kansas City, Texas or wherever. It just has to taste good. Charlotte has had it's share of BBQ places over the years - some local joints and others where chains. None have really wowed me like Midwood Smokehouse. Out of the dozen or so times I have eaten there it has been consistently delicious. I go there specifically for the beef brisket. It is quite literally the best brisket I have ever had and the kind you think about long after you have finished your meal. I usually get the half and half (half lean, half fat). The flavor of the bark from whatever magical rub they are using should be deemed a national treasure and samples of it should be put in the Smithsonian to celebrate its greatness. The word is out and this place is quickly becoming the hot spot for BBQ in the Charlotte region. So much so that seating has been a problem. But not anymore. They just expanded and opened a new section of the restaurant to seat more people. In a way that makes me sad because I wanted this place all to myself."}
{"text":"Got to do the 3star review and i was so looking forward to it. Found the place ok. Bbq didn't remind me of the q i get in SC , it was dry. Everything just seemed greasy and overdone. The fiance got sick about an hour later. I'll try again because i know so many peeps have liked this place but it was too overdone for me."}
{"text":"One of the better bbq joints in the Charlotte area. And there are many. Try the Abiline Brisket sandwich. The whole menus has great stuff. Definitely try a few of the sides."}
{"text":"Well well well. Being impressed by a bbq joint is though to pull off in Carolina. But Midwood is impressive. I must say their Abiline brisket sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Wow. Good beer selection and great sides. I have been twice so far and plan to make it a regular. Go try it out."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here.  Went there for my Graduation from CPCC with family and all of the food choices we had were delicious.  My favorite would be the Bar-b-que queso.  We choose  to go with the pulled pork, but I am sure the brisket would have been good also.  My smoked turkey was moist and very thick sliced.  Friendly staff made for a great dining experience with our four year old.  I would recommend for both couples out for a drink and families with children also.   If there was one complaint is was that their small parking lot is full most of the time, but that doesn't seem like a problem at all now does it?"}
{"text":"Just had the Carolina pork with greens and was not disappointed. Look forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"I went here with my cousin and it was to die for. The wings were amazing, and my half chicken with cole slaw and Mac and cheese was literally melt in your mouth, bursting with flavor. I am drooling just thinking about it. I love how they give you the sauces  on the side and you can try each of them to find the one you like best. I am in love with the mustard one. Best BBQ sauce ever. You have to check this place out if you are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Down home Carolina BBQ!  Carolina BBQ means pork. Pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce.  I'm a Texan, and I appreciate good BBQ. I seek it out. That's why I was so pleased to try Midwood Smokehouse. I was fairly clueless about Carolina style BBQ, and was excited when the waitress knew exactly what I should have when I said I wanted local style BBQ. They served me up two heaping spoonfuls of pulled pork, topped with onions, a side of hushpuppies, and bacon-wrapped jalapenos.  The bbq sauce was vinegar based, with spices and peppers sloshing around the bottom of the mix. I've never quite understood vinegar based sauces, but enjoyed the pickled pepper flavors  when mixed with the pork. Parts of the pulled pork had that char on it, or bark, which gave some pieces a smoky, crunchy quality.  The hushpuppies seemed like deep fried pieces of cornbread. They had a slight sweetness to the cornbread. Decent.  I wasn't wild about the bacon wrapped jalapenos. Being from San Antonio, we know our jalapenos, and these weren't the most primo peppers. On the small side, and overcooked so that they squish when you bite 'em. I was blown away by the beer list. They had a rare cask aged beer, and lots of local options for fine beer.  Unfortunately, they were out of a lot of items, so our selections were somewhat hampered.  The service was very friendly, and they made lots of great recommendations and carefully explained a little about everything we were eating. You could tell that they take pride in the BBQ here."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best barbecue we have had in Charlotte since moving here. The staff was so nice and was able to give recommendations. Any awesome environment. If you want to stay close to the city but want barbecue this is the place to go. I had the brisket (AMAZING) with the twiced baked potatoes and hush puppies! My family had the pork burnt ends and pulled chicken! Couldn't be happier with this choice and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best BBQ in Charlotte. It's done right and everything is always tasty. If you get there late, they may be out of the more popular menu items...so try to get there as early as possible.  If they ever have the fried mac & cheese with pimento cheese....GET IT! Don't even consider NOT getting it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, very friendly staff welcoming & attentive. Consistent recipes, resulting in delicious meals.  Well balanced flavors in the rub & the smoking of the meat.  Impressive beef brisket & Mac & cheesr"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! Would definitely go back and recommend to others.  I had the pulled pork, baked beans, and mac and cheese. Hush puppies are also served with the entrees. Also, it was very affordable - ~$12 per person.   The restaurant was very crowded during lunch on a weekend, so I would recommend calling in advance."}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 for 11am on a Saturday. Nice to know they now take reservations. Service was very good and so was the food. Everyone had some type of brisket with all dishes looking different. Portions were hearty, food was hot and tasted very good We all want to return. Just wish they would turn down the music. Can't stand yelling to be heard."}
{"text":"The pimento fries are very filling and a good starter. The combo sampler is a nice way to try most everything. The brisket was awesome. I like it fattier but we got the mixed to share. The fatty ends just completely melted. They have not overly-sweet sweet tea. I liked both their bbq sauces. The tomato based on was nice with a little bite at the end. Not so spicy that the kids couldn't eat it either so probably just the right amount."}
{"text":"We were a party of five for dinner on a Saturday night.  Everyone was very happy with the food.  We were seated right away and service was very friendly and attentive.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"BAAMMM, The second you walk in the hickory smoke hits you right in the face.. No worries get cold beer and a bacon wrap jalapeño to help you settle you in.  Service : 4 stars Food: 4 Stars Restroom : 4 stars Price vs quantity : 5 stars  If you leave this place hungry, you should put a apple in your mouth and jump in the smoker pig.."}
{"text":"So I've been going to Midwood Smokehouse for a few months now. One night I decided to get some smoked wings to go. I get home and my wings are undercooked. Called the manager who have me a chemistry lesson on wings instead of saying \"I'm sorry about that. Let's just get you some more wings.\" I literally live around the corner from this restaurant and would spend a pretty good amount there. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bar-b-que I've eaten in Charlotte. I'm originally from Texas, so I love some good BBQ. However, I'd been relatively disappointed in the BBQ I've had in Charlotte until I came to Midwood. We ordered the pulled pork, chicken, brisket, and burnt ends, collard greens, bacon wrapped jalapeños, and creamed corn. Everything was delicious! I'm a connoisseur of good brisket, and this did not disappoint. I'm excited to go back and try the ribs! Carry on Midwood; I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the Midwood Smokehouse behind Park Road Shopping Center tonight. Even though we had to wait for a table, the service was very good and food was great. We split the 4 meat combo \"well-fed\" and still had to get a to go box.  The management and staff were attentive. They made sure everything was right. We will definitely return to this location. In my opinion, the best of the 3 Midwood locations I have eaten at."}
{"text":"Wait staff is on point. Food is delicious  Obama ate here and he had my vote so that's two thumbs up for this place  meat is good but the Mac and cheese so damn good!"}
{"text":"I have to admit.... We went in on a Saturday (first thing) and we were expecting great things! Unfortunately, our waitress was clearly pre-occupied or simply untrained - the place was NOT busy and almost immediate after taking our first bites, she placed the check on the table. What?!? We actually wanted dessert! But ok, fair enough, we'll pass on dessert..... She saw we still had food on our plates about 10 mins in and she asked if we wanted boxes. I thought for sure that I was on a hidden camera show... Are you kidding me? She tried to offer a box for our toddler and almost took his half eaten food away to clear the table. How bizarre!!! The place wasn't packed with tables waiting either - it wasn't even noon. We were so put off that we were rushed out that we can guarantee we won't be back for quite sometime. Waiting tables is NOT about rushing customers out the door. I was disappointed and can only hope this young woman gets coached - tips and \"regulars\" come from good service AND good food. Not one OR the other."}
{"text":"Great food. The cheese fries app was very good and so was the brisket. Get the sausage as an add, very flavorful. I'm not a fan of mustard based sauce but theirs was really good."}
{"text":"My favorite bbq spot in town.   If they are offering the burnt ends you have to get them."}
{"text":"Must go. Must eat everything you can.  The midwood chopped salad is fabulous. Get it tossed with the green goddess.  Go for the pimento cheese fries and you might as well throw some bbq on them :)  I always get the same thing...bbq pork plate with bbq slaw (vinegary and delicious) and bacon wrapped jalapeños.   They have platters too...which usually feeds me and my hubby and leaves us with plenty to take home.   Service is always great...although sometimes the servers are a bit aloof. I prefer to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Outstanding bbq and food. Thst could easily beat Bobby Flay in a throw down. This must for bbq lovers."}
{"text":"Came in for some late lunch on a Saturday at 2:00 and was sat immediately and offered something to drink by the server.   We got a half rack of St. Louis ribs with the dry rub and the Texas hash that was on special. Everything was good. The hush puppies were really little and you only get a few of them. The smoked veggies side was very oily and was nothing special. The ribs were cooked really well, falling off the bone.   The hash came with 2 slices of sourdough toast buttered and was topped with two fried eggs and a half of an avocado sliced. It had great flavor but the brisket was really fatty. The hash is a good greasy breakfast/brunch meal for sure."}
{"text":"When I visited my cousin in Charlotte, I couldn't wait to have some real BBQ.  I'm down south for goodness sakes! How could I go wrong? I was told about the rave reviews received by this restaurant and was excited to eat here. I cannot explain how disappointed I was with this place.  The portions were tiny and the food had no flavor.   I ordered the pulled chicken. I received a scoop of meat that appeared to be barely the amount of a chicken thigh. It was pale and dry.   After I tried it, I told the waiter it was flavorless.  He said since the skin is pulled off, the flavor leaves with it.   First of all, you can season under the skin, as I do at home.   Secondly, if you let the chicken sit overnight after you've seasoned it, the meat picks up more flavor. Lastly, if you smoke it or BBQ it, the flavor permeates the meat.  Give me a break! What kind of BBQ spot is this? Dinosaur BBQ runs circles around this place! I will never, ever eat here again. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, YUMMMMMM!!! Favorite BBQ place in Charlotte. Our waiter was awesome too. Super nice and enthusiastic about the restaurant."}
{"text":"I found this on Yelp. I've pasted this several times but never stopped until today. I ordered take-out. Based on the bartender recommendations, I ordered pulled pork plate with baked beans and collard greens. The pulled pork and baked beans were good. The collards were a little tougher than I like. However they were seasoned pretty good. The serving size is large. I could not eat it all in one sitting."}
{"text":"Fast service, the guy at the bar was on his game at lunch and served up a well poured beer after taking my order. Food was fast and delicious all in all a great time. 10/10 will munch here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I got the blackened salmon sandwich with roasted corn, red onions, tomato and coleslaw on top. Delicious! The French Fries were so so...  My husband got the lean brisket plate with coleslaw and hush puppies! He thought it was all mouth watering. Great place, pretty cheap; the only thing I really didn't like was the seating. It is very snug. You can almost touch the person at the next table.  *Stephanie K-I can't figure out how to message you back. Because your food is SO outstandingly good I think the restaurant is packed all the time. I'm a small woman, but even I felt way too close to people. We were seated in the back of the restaurant...the very far back wall area near an exit door. It was a row of two seater type tables against the far back wall. But...that said, the food is worth it! I have raved to quite a few friends, and my mother in law flew in from California and was absolutely delighted with the sampler platter!"}
{"text":"Best brisket in town!!! My boyfriend and I go here every Sunday for brisket! They ALWAYS have great food, great service, and great drinks!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to restaurants. In fact, we eat out A LOT, and we come here more than anywhere else. All the BBQ is good. Maybe it's great. We love this place. Tall Tom is the kindest, best waiter in the world. If you're fortunate enough to get him you'll be spoiled. In fact, you should request Tom when you go. Then you'll enjoy some of the best BBQ in Charlotte (or maybe anywhere?) plus you'll have the best server around. May as well make the whole evening great, right??  Believe it or not, in spite of the fact that the BBQ is great, and we love BBQ, maybe our favorite thing on the menu is the Midwood chopped salad. We usually get it with grilled salmon and balsamic dressing, but seriously, it's so good without the protein that I almost always get it that way now. Go and enjoy!  And don't forget to ask for Tom!  (He's super tall---just so you know you've got the right guy) ;))"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that we never squabble about going to eat. The staff is exceptional always!  We were seated outside and \"forgotten\" apparently (we don't think/feel that we were), the manager apologized profusely about the mix-up.  She took care of us personally!  We are always full after the entree and never have space for dessert, so we made a special just to do so without a meal once.  Drew is the man and we seek him out whenever we go!"}
{"text":"Why can't half stars be implemented? This place seriously deserve 4.5 stars but I can't give it a 5. Here's why. I've been a big fan of Mac's speed shop and I heard this place rivals Mac's and so I had to try it out. Luckily, Midwood opened a location right next to my house (yes!) so it makes commuting so much easier.  Once we walked in, we noticed how the whole restaurant is decked out with televisions. It seems like a nice place to watch the game and grab some grub. But for a Sunday night, the joint seems pretty dead. The place was only about a quarter full but I attributed that to it being a newer location. Now onward to the food:  We ordered the pimento cheese fries loaded with beef brisket and smoked wings as starters. The wings were ok but the cheese fries? Oh man, it was really good. It had the right amount of melted cheese and a generous amount of smokey brisket bits on top. The serving portion was also a lot bigger than we thought and so we already started to get a bit full before our entrees arrived. For our entrees we ordered the burnt ends with smoked veggies and a combo platter. Let me break it down for you:  The goodies: Burnt ends: the star of the night. Not many places do burnt ends (or in this case make it right) and it had the right amount of crispness on the outside and tenderness in the inside. It even got my Chinese family of 6 (that are not fans of American barbecue) fighting for that last piece.  Carolina chopped pork: moister and more tender than most BBQ joints Mac & cheese: well it's hard to mess up Mac & cheese and they definitely did not. The flavors were spot on but I wished it was a bit hotter. Bacon wrapped jalapeños: hot and spicy. Just the way I like it.  The not so goodies: Beef brisket: it was just alright but could be more tender, juicer than even a bit fattier. I thought their brisket was too lean to get that smokey flavor that brisket tends to have. St. Louis pork ribs: I've been spoiled with some good ribs and these were just alright. With the right dipping sauce they became enjoyable. Chopped chicken BBQ: too dried for my taste. I wish they offered a whole piece of chicken on the combo plate instead of shredded.  We also ordered the banana pudding and it was really good. I liked how they used actual cake bits instead of just wafers. However, the star of the show was definitely the burnt ends and that by itself made my night. I would definitely return just to order a whole large plate of burnt ends for myself alongside their vast amount of draft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte.  Didn't think I would like anywhere better than Mac's but this place.  Must have the bacon wrapped jalapenos as a side!"}
{"text":"Wow, Excellent barbecue!  I had the sampler platter.  The meats were very nicely smoked.   I have had smoked barbeque all over the US, and there can be a wide variety among restaurants.  Midwood did an excellent job balancing the wood flavors in the preparation of their meat.  Carolina style barbecue is typically served in a vinegar sauce.  They chose to provide the vinegar sauce on the side, so I could choose to regulate the amount of vinegar flavor in my barbecue.  They also provided a slightly sweetened vinegar sauce, So I was not dipping my meat into pure vinegar.  I have been to many backwoods Carolina barbecue restaurants that just soak their meat in pure vinegar.  Terrible stuff.  Thankfully, Midwood does not do this.  They let the meat and the smoking process provide the flavor.  The vinegar sauce is not acidic and mild enough to enhance the flavor.  It is one of the best barbecue restaurants that I have visited in the US."}
{"text":"Fantastic food every time I come here! Very friendly staff and great service. I am a pescatarian, and the smoked salmon is the bomb.com . The food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 3 1/2 stars.. my son advised i should have at least tasted the ribs... well, by the time we got there , they were all gone .. This place was just ok to me... I had the mayo based coleslaw, it was just ok, as were the beans ."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is amazing. It was so good in fact that my wife suggested that we change our travel plans and stay another night in Charlotte just to eat here tomorrow for lunch. Undoubtedly the best pork ribs I've ever had and hands-down the best baked beans  on the planet."}
{"text":"I think my Ribs and BBQ beans deserved a 4 and a half. Service a Four. The ribs were moist and tender and had a great flavor. The beans were just full of character and enjoyable to eat. My Chicken and Mac and cheese deserve a 3 !  Let me explain why: the chicken breast was like rubber to cut and chew! The manager did inquire and offer another piece (which is why I am giving a 4 star instead of three) I declined as I had eaten most of it, just disappointed . The Mac and cheese had no soul! It was cold and bland, like it had been sitting in a giant pan waiting to end its life :)  Love having this place in the hood and will walk over again and try other dishes. Warning they are new and run out of Ribs early so go early and order right away :)"}
{"text":"Cristie was an amazing server. The experience and the food combined were untouchable. I will definitely be back to see the restaurant along with cristie."}
{"text":"Great service and good salad options w/ and w/out meat (try the smoked salmon- it's delicious!). Definitely a long wait on the weekends so join the wait list online before you arrive."}
{"text":"Visiting, i had to come here....reading the reviews i was not let down.  i got the sampler.....GET THE SAMPLER  I was so full, i couldnt finish, but i wish i could go back just for this place...  i have had BBQ everywhere, this place is bomb diggity! Try it!"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to say that the only time my mister and I get barbecue is when we have visitors from out-of-town. Well, Midwood Smokehouse is our go-to choice for meeting any barbecue hankerings. Plus, you get some of the local flavor from the surrounding Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Kill two family visit birds with one stone!  In terms of food, I've sampled a little bit of everything from the menu at this point, but the Cuban sandwich is usually what ends up calling my name. It's a solid choice with some of the chopped smoked pork for that barbecue taste .The local beer selection is on point, and has just enough offerings without overwhelming. I also appreciate that they do have regular drink specials."}
{"text":"This is going to be a fairly short review because simply put: my favorite BBQ in the city.   I regular here a few times a month and it's easily one of the most consistently delicious restaurants I've ever been to. The BBQ burnt tips are one of the best BBQ dishes I think I've ever had (including the infamous Rendezvous in Memphis!) and their sandwiches are always tender and hot.   Once and a while they'll have a Garlic Wing special. If you go and they have them you hit the lottery; they're incredible. The wait staff is always on point, fast but not quick to rush you out. It's always incredibly clean and the drink specials are usually pretty decent. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this place and I've eaten here literally dozens of times."}
{"text":"friends took us here when we were visiting and it was legit. Unfortunately they were out of ribs (it was a holiday weekend in the evening) but the rest was really good so it didn't really matter. Got the pig out and got extra brisket and substituted burnt ends (which hands down are the best thing on the menu). They actually missed our extra brisket order and before we even talked to the manager..she brought like extra extra brisket so we got more than we had originally ordered! Now that's customer service! Creamed corn is amazing, Mac and cheese was good, not great ( didn't stop me from eating it all). Overall, really great food!"}
{"text":"I had their cheesesteak and it was made with brisket, carmelized onion, and white American cheese on a homemade roll. It was the BEST I've ever had! The sweet potato fries were great too! Just yummmm."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse opened its second location on May 7, 2015 in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte. It's in the old Sticky Fingers Smokehouse space at Toringdon Circle (shopping center). I visited this restaurant a couple weeks after it opened with a group of friends, two of whom make up two-thirds of the Barbecue Bros (http://barbecuebros.co/). We ordered a nice sampling of BBQ and enjoyed the experience. The food and service were good.  At 5:45pm on a Friday, the restaurant was already very busy. We were told by the hostess that our wait would be about 30 minutes. We were seated in about 20. There wasn't much space at the bar so we waited outside with others. By the time we left around 7:15pm, the number of folks waiting had grown quite large. There must've been at least a half-dozen groups/families waiting.  The inside of the restaurant resembles an American restaurant chain such as Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. The clean, open space features both a bar and dining room with a mixture of booths and tables. Our group of six sat in one of the circular bench-style booths by the windows. The interior sports several large TVs (great for watching sports), vintage North Carolina artwork and memorabilia, and artistic metal cutouts with a BBQ, farm, and kitchen theme.  I haven't been to Midwood Smokehouse's original location in Plaza Midwood, but I was told by my tablemates that that location is different in look and feel. This location in Ballantyne is designed for the suburbs. There's plenty of parking too.  The BBQ served here is influenced from various styles from the Carolinas to Texas. Aside from the standard sandwiches and plates, Midwood Smokehouse also serves salads, tacos, and appetizers like Pimento Cheese Fries, Fried Pickles, and Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos. Expect to spend about $8-10 each for most sandwiches (includes a side) and about $10-18 each for most plates. Plates come in both small and large sizes.  We went with the following:  BBQ: * Burnt Ends (small, $13.50) - crispy caramelized cubes of brisket tossed in a housemade Fat Tire BBQ sauce * Combo Platter (\"Well-Fed,\" $22), which came with: * Carolina Chopped Pork - hickory-smoked chopped pork lightly dressed in Eastern NC vinegar sauce * Beef Brisket (both fatty and lean) - Texas-style sliced beef brisket served in natural juices * Smoked Sausage - combination of beef, pork, and garlic * Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs (dry) - smoked  Apps & Sides: * Hushpuppies (whole basket, $5) - scratch-made, slightly sweet and warm, served with BBQ sauce * Collard Greens * Classic Mac & Cheese * BBQ Slaw  I liked everything. The food had simple presentation and was served in old-fashioned plates and bowls with floral decorations akin to something you'd expect to find at your grandma's house.  The Burnt Ends were rather tender and flavorful. They were more tender than I was expecting. A good bit of sauce, flavor (sweetness), and caramelization. These were probably my favorite of the BBQ meats. The Carolina Chopped Pork was on par with other chopped pork I've had around the state. Moist and tasty, the meat was smoked with hickory logs from North Carolina.  You have the option of ordering the Beef Brisket fatty, lean, or both. We got both and the brisket was delectable. Smoky with an appetizing chew and consistency. The Smoked Sausage was A-OK. Plump and glistening, it was charred on one side and had firm texture and bite. The Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs were excellent. Near \"fall off the bone,\" the somewhat fatty meat and rub were packed with delicious flavor. Note the ribs are available with sauce as well.  BBQ sauces at the table included South Carolina Mustard, Eastern NC Vinegar, Midwood Signature, and Habanero. My favorite was the subtly sweet Midwood Signature, but really, none of the BBQ needed any sauce. The meats tasted fine without it.  The Hushpuppies were small and soft, almost squishy. They weren't crispy nor crunchy, but had comparatively smooth centers. The Collards, with bits of pork, were alright as was the BBQ Slaw. When it comes to slaw, you can order both mayo-based \"Coleslaw\" or the NC traditional vinegar-based \"BBQ Slaw\" (a.k.a. red slaw), finely chopped. The Mac & Cheese was great. Made with elbow macaroni, it was nice and cheesy with small, chewy bits of hardened, charred cheese. It was moderately oily, but lots of good mac 'n cheese are greasy.  Service was terrific. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time and I was impressed with how our server remembered our food and drink orders after we'd changed our minds and switched them up on her. Kudos. Founder/owner Frank Scibelli personally checked on our table. Midwood Smokehouse plans to open more locations including one in Columbia, SC.  If you like BBQ, these guys are worth checking out."}
{"text":"When we want bbque we go to the mid wood smokehouse.  Great ribs, brisket and sausage.  They smoke their own meat have great beer on tap.  Great meal and the desserts are excellent to with their pecan pie.  They opened another smokehouse in Ballantyne, but it is not as good as the Midwood original location."}
{"text":"Great quality BBQ with a classic American vibe.  Whenever I have family visiting from the west coast I will always bring them here.  Bacon wrapped jalapeños, smoked veggies, baked beans, creamed corn and a big 4 meat combo plater is my go to selection and feeds four people easily."}
{"text":"I'm not a HUGE BBQ fan but this place was great!! With moving to the south from Chicago, I knew that I needed to find some good BBQ places and this is definitely one of them!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get BBQ in Charlotte. The meat has a great flavor, the sides are always delicious (bacon wrapped jalapenos, mac n' cheese, pickled onions, hushpuppies) and they always have a good selection of local beer on draft. My husband and I recently ordered a salad from here as to have a lighter meal and WOW! I had no idea a salad could be that tasty. The waiters are always very friendly and helpful. I've probably been here more than 10 times and have never had a bad experience. The food is always on point and consistent."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars for me.    I'm not a BBQ fan but came here to help celebrate a birthday.  What's cool about this place is the outside area where you can play corn hole while you wait for your table.  Establishment was full of hungry patrons so I was starting to think that maybe this BBQ was going to be different.  Staff is friendly, bartender was really nice and I even saw a coworker.  Location is perfect and I was ready to nibble on my Hubs' food (since I don't do BBQ I didn't order anything)   Hubs ordered I think the brisket sandwich.  O.M.Google.  Salty.  Greasy and what's with the blue cheese???  Fries were good though. Hubs had to scrape off the blue cheese as he hated it too.  The bread also looked like Texas Toast.  Just not a fan....so sorry.    Upside were the beer specials and also the banana pudding.  THAT was good.  yum."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and food was really great. This place gets busy on the weekend so expect a little wait but the service was nice and very quick. We got a few appetizers and they were all good but the pimento cheese fries are awesome and highly recommend!! I got pulled pork and mac & cheese and both were awesome. Their bbq slaw is also different but good, has a sweet but tangy flavor to it.  I plan to go back again!"}
{"text":"I didn't really like this place. The BBQ was cold, servers were not friendly. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We started our Saturday on a leisurely, lazy pace. We hit Starbucks to start off our day right with various beverages. I parked as we tried to figure out where we wanted to go. One of my friends needed to use the washroom.  After about forty minutes being undecided, I suggested that we have lunch. I had no problem taking a recommendation from my friend's friend. We headed to Midwood Smokehouse.  Getting there was a bit tricky. I missed the odd turn and had to reroute. It's in a plaza that is ridiculously busy. However, when I was closer to the smokehouse, parking was a breeze.  We were immediately seated in a booth. One of my friends had no hesitation in ordering the well-fed combo platter with me. It consists of Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, St. Louis style pork ribs, hickory smoked sausage, hushpuppies, and mac and cheese.  My other friend does not eat pork. She ordered the barbequed chicken, with onions, hushpuppies, coleslaw, and veggies.  I also got a Diet Coke. You get unlimited refills. I got three drinks in total and got down to 2.5 glasses.  As far as barbeque goes, this place is amazing! The smoked sausage has cheese with some kick to it. It was awesome! The ribs fell off the bone and were so flavourful. My friend and I were nodding in agreement that they were the best ribs that we have ever had. The beef brisket was equally as tender and flavourful.   My friend knew that I have a weakness for mac and cheese. I got more of it. She was so generous. It was perfect.  Before coming to North Carolina, I was doing research on what foods are local to the state. I didn't get much information on it. I learned far more at this restaurant. It offers two types of barbeque sauce: a tomato-based one and a Carolina vinegar-based one. I loved the latter more. It was delicious.  This place also serves hushpuppies. They are deep-fried cornmeal goodness that is a Carolina thing. It tends to accompany barbeque. As a cornmeal lover, the huspuppies were so good and highly addictive!  Even though we were all pretty stuffed, we kicked it up a notch on the food coma scale and shared the chocolate cake. It was incredible! The crunchy chocolate crumble on top was unexpected and worked nicely with the moist, rich chocolate cake. Such a wonderful surprise!  Our server was wonderful. He moved to the States from Spain and was wonderful to chat with. He was attentive to our needs. This place is lucky to have him as an employee.  If you want delicious barbeque with great service, come here. You will not be disappointed.  (133)"}
{"text":"I really love midwood, they have great food. One thing I would recommend surprisingly enough is their salad topped with BBQ. It has tons of yummy toppings and its a really good price for the size and quality."}
{"text":"Well, you know I have to try BBQ places wherever I go to see who has the best. First time in Charlotte and I must say this place is up there with the best BBQ places in the US.  I had the ribs and the brisket and they were delish. Very tasty and smoky and very tender.  The Mac n cheese was not bad and the greens were pretty good too.  Hush puppies were good. The service was excellent n the price was about what I expected.  Way to go."}
{"text":"So I thought I had good BBQ before but now I really really know I had good BBQ. A short wait for our party of six, we ordered the nachos with chicken for an appetizer. They had a little kick to them! Very tasty!   I took the bartender's advice and got the \"burnt ends\" which are amazing nuggets of carmelized brisket with BBQ sauce. I am not a huge beef fan but I could be if I had this meal choice available to me all the time. So incredibly tender and delicious. And oh my goodness those BBQ beans! A must have. I also got to try some of my dinner mates collard greens. A first for me. They kind of tasted like spinach with a thicker texture. Not bad! Oh and those hush puppies. I never really had a hush puppy that I thought tasted good. I didn't realize why people even ate those until now!!   The ginger lemon jack drink was so yummy! Great food and great service!  I'm so full and happy right now."}
{"text":"This is one of the best barbecue places I've ever been. The burnt ends were to die for, and the ribs were delicious and perfectly cooked. Great relaxed atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq place even for someone who knows a bbq place in s Lake Tahoe. Good job y'all."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Server very nice.  Bacon wrapped jalapeno a definite must of you like spicy.  Burnt ends ends tasty."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and plentiful well thought out seating for large groups or small. Music is a little loud (and country) wait staff is hit or miss especially around 9pm (restaurant is open till 11pm) The several times we have been staff sometimes gets caught up doing side work and forgets to check back timely. The food makes up for it."}
{"text":"It was a great day to sit outside and have lunch at Midwood Smokehouse. We began with the BBQ Queso with Pork. It was quite tasty and as we finished our app the food arrived promptly. I dined on the Brisket (they give you an option for lean, fatty, or mixed; I had the lean brisket with the Midwood BBQ sauce. The beef was fine and the sauce was a good compliment. The mac and cheese was A+ and worth every calorie. The plates come with hushpuppies, which were fried crisp. We didn't get dessert but it sure was tempting. The indoor atmosphere looked very appealing, the staff was present, and the food was tasty. It definitely worth the stop if you are in the Park Road Shopping Center and looking for some good ole Southern BBQ."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! The atmosphere is not my favorite but the food is always good. Their side salad for $5 is fantastic with the avocado goddess dressing! I eat here more than I care to admit and order it at least once a month to go. Great place to eat or order out and eat at home."}
{"text":"Worst experience here EVER!! If you're ever in a rush or expect to get your food at a reasonable time, definitely don't come here. We were told our food would be ready in 15 mins and we waited well over 40mins. The manager eventually came out and said they ran out of chicken and that's why they had to restart our whole order. Worst experience ever and I'd highly suggest to not come here"}
{"text":"I came in here with some rolling papers and a lighter but quickly found out it was NOT that kind of smokehouse. After I got over my brief disappointment I discovered it was my second favorite kind of smokehouse... the barbecue kind!   The set up is really nice and spacious. We went for lunch and were sat immediately and got our food pretty quickly. We tried these bacon wrapped stuff jalapeno peppers that were to die for.   Midwood believes that those who stay ready don't have to get ready. They keep the BBQ sauces on deck on each table and they have wet naps on hand. You'd be surprised how many restaurants serve sticky food items and no wet naps.   The manager came over and checked on our table a couple of time as well. That was pretty dope. Not the kind of dope I expected in a place called Smokehouse but still dope. At least it wasn't named Midwood Traphouse. Although I guess they do move a lot of birds.   While we're here... Lebron James should win the NBA MVP every single year he's in the league. I mean what else does this guy have to do. I think he could take a pick up team from the local YMCA to the NBA finals. We really don't appreciate the greats while they are playing.   He never gets injured, he is an outspoken social critic and he doesn't cheat on his wife. We can't say that about Jordan, Kobe or anyone else you'd consider to be the king of the NBA.  The biggest knock on him is that he moved from Cleveland to Miami when he was 20 something years old. Yeah like YOU wouldn't do that if you could. It's time for people to let the Lebron James hate go and give him his flowers while he can still smell him."}
{"text":"So sad to see this place going downhill.  Been going there since first opened few years ago, usually take out but often dine in.  I live 5 minutes away and order would be ready on arrival or very soon, even when busy.  Best BBQ in town by far.  Knew me by name. But as got busier they cared less.  Now new policy is  call-in orders go to bottom of priority list.  Took 50 minutes to prepare and serve my one dish I called in from road.  Meanwhile I watched guests arrive, wait for table, get seated, order and eat appetizers, get 2d round of drinks, order and get dinner.  Bar maid proud of anti-takeout policy.  Bragged been that way forever, but she seemed new.  Not ever going again.  Poor service and strange (greedy?) policy."}
{"text":"I am into this place! I am not typically huge on BBQ, but I really enjoyed both the ambiance and the staff!  First off, you can claim a place on line via Yelp. What a god send on a cold night! Loved it!!  Second, Gary was an AMAZING server who clearly knows the business and what they have to offer.  My husband and I pretty much stuffed ourselves silly but the food was great! I had the Philly Cheese steak with creamed corn and my husband ate the \"burnt ends\" brisket meal with yummy sides as well! The queso app was delish and they have Bourbon  flights... how fun is that? We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best smokehouses I have visited. The meat was cooked to perfection and the sides were delectable. Our server was very attentive and the management checked to see how we were doing. The environment was great, with seating indoors and out. Also not to bad on the pricing for what you get. We loved it!"}
{"text":"MEAT all the way.   Had the best rack of ribs. Service was awesome. The \"burnt beef ends\" was another delicacy.  Must try also includes the \"pecan cobbler with vanilla scoop\" from the dessert section."}
{"text":"I have had carry-out only from this restaurant.  It was decent.  A little on the pricey side.  I am not a big fan of southern BBQ, so maybe I am the wrong person to ask.  There was definitely nothing wrong with my order.  It was made promptly to order.  The staff answering the phone and who greeted me upon arrival was very pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that our waiter was great. He was very attentive and accommodating. The food however was another story. I had the beef tips which were actually ok. That's where it ended. The mac and cheese was absolutely gross, the ribs and chicken were not good at all. My husband and I even ordered drinks and those left something to be desired. I was told afterwards that we should've gone to the original smokehouse in plaza midwood."}
{"text":"Good service, good sauces, and good Carolina BBQ for a very reasonable price! Brisket covered fries with pimento cheese  Pulled pork sandwich and hush puppies  Homemade Mac and Cheese"}
{"text":"Good service. Burnt ends didn't live up to description. Ribs were juicy and flavorful but overall they had an overwhelming black pepper taste. Macaroni and cheese was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Head the half rack with baked beans and hush puppies. Man, this place was awesome! The ribs were so tender and the beans had brisket throughout. I definitely plan to come back and highly recommend you gone them a try. Really good bbq and the staff wad super friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place is a must for barbecue novices and enthusiasts! My husband and I ate here on Friday night for the first time but not the last! I am a very picky eater & enjoyed everything I ate. The Brisket was very good! They even ask if you want fat, lean, or both, which, I now know,means they know what they are doing! Richard & his staff made us feel welcomed and appreciated as customers! Be sure to save room for dessert-the Pecan Cobbler is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best beef brisket in town! The sides are also VERY tasty - my fave are the smoked veggies!"}
{"text":"I recently relocated from Texas, and have been searching for some decent brisket. I was so thrilled that MS not only knew what wet brisket was, but produced some of the best I've had in a loooong time!  I am so excited that I now have an authentic bbq place to eat in Charlotte!  The service was fast and friendly, atmosphere great, and I also loved the side item of smoked veggies.  Delicious!  We are going back today!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good. Burnt ends and Smoked Mac n cheese where outstanding Service was not great but I would return"}
{"text":"As a server myself, I'm particularly critical of service at restaurants but Midwood Smokehouse did not disappoint! Our server, Sheena was friendly, attentive, and efficient. Everyone loved the food as well...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love good BBQ so I'm definitely loving Midwood Smokehouse. I've been trying to find a good brisket lately and I think the search is finally over. They actually let you choose what type of brisket you like (fatty or lean) and their BBQ sauce is spot on. My brisket was really tender and was cooked to perfection. It wasn't rubbery at all... The bacon wrapped jalepeno's are an awesome idea (of course wrap anything in bacon and I'll love it!). Their baked beans were delicious too... If you're craving some BBQ this is some of the best in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"This place is so consistently good, you have to try it. My favorite is the briquette and burnt ends."}
{"text":"Good portions of food even on the small plates. My fiancé loved his brisket with the habanero BBQ sauce and the pork BBQ was so good with the classic NC style vinegar sauce. Bacon wrapped jalapeños were awesome! Service was real attentive and food came out fast, will definitely go back when I visit Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"While not my favorite style of BBQ, I can still recognize how good this place is. I lived in Houston for a couple of years and after tasting Midwood's brisket, I was immediately suspicious their might be a Texan in the kitchen - and I was right. Texas is not known for pulled pork and ribs - nope... it's all about the brisket and sausage. This place nails both and I love that they have an option of lean or fatty brisket.  This place might have the best 'cue in Charlotte, although my pallet is better suited for Mac's...."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Charlotte so far. Great service and staff. Got the BBQ platter to share."}
{"text":"When you want BBQ, Midwood Smokehouse is the place to go! Any time we have out of town visitors that want southern BBQ, we don't hesitate to take them here. The service, the ambience, the food, it's everything you want in a BBQ joint.   Personally, all the meats are delicious, but what I care about are the sides. In my humble opinion, they have the best collard greens in all of Charlotte. Don't forget to ask for their homemade pepper vinegar, because that just takes it over the top delicious. Midwood was actually the place that turned me into a collard eater, and I thank them for it. My husband swears by their Mac and cheese and will always get it as his side. It's the kind of Mac and cheese that you dig your fork in and the gooey strings of cheese follow the noodles all the way out of the bowl.   We had friends visiting that also do competition BBQ back in the northeast and they were able to see the whole smoker operation in the back, which I thought was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The brisket is awesome , full of flavor . Can't go wrong with anything in the menu ."}
{"text":"I have been going to Midwood for years.  I am very picky when it comes to BBQ and I love the pulled pork that Midwood has.   All of their sides are also amazing, you really can't go wrong with any of them.    I have been there when they have been slow and when they have been super busy.  Overall their service is consistently good and their servers are friendly.   We love Midwood so much, this was the location of choice for our wedding rehearsal dinner.  All of our out of town guest LOVED the food and still rave about it to this day."}
{"text":"Came in for my birthday and had Audrey as our server, she was so aware and perky and attentitive. No matter what we asked for it seemed like it was no problem for her to get for us. highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yummy! I went here with a friend recently, and not only was the service SPECTACULAR, but the food was incredible. I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the brisket sandwich! Hooray! The meat was tender, juicy, and super flavorful. There are many items on the menu that I want to try...but alas...my calorie counter won't let me try everything at once. So, I guess I'll just have to go back ;)"}
{"text":"After a poor experience in another Charlotte BBQ place earlier this week we tried Midwood Smokehouse. The sun was shining and we were seated at a table outside at our request.  Mary was a fantastic server and I had the ribs (dry), mac & cheese and bacon-wrapped jalapeños. Tried all of there sauces and preferred the house mix and the habanero mix. My only mistake was in ordering the full rack as I had no room for desert.  After the meal Mary arranged for the manager to give us a tour of their hickory-fired smoker.  All in all a great meal and a very nice time."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared an order of smoked wings, I had a plate of burnt-ends, and she a chopped salad with brisket.  Wings? Brisket? No, this is not traditional Carolina BBQ. They have a fairly good selection of beers and food was good. The atmosphere has a touch of a corporate feel to it, but the service was absolutely fantastic.   Did I feel like I had died and gone to BBQ-heaven? No, but definitely not a bad place to go if you have a hankering for it. Overall, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  The pulled chicken is AMAZING!!!!   They have numerous sides to choose from, but you can't go wrong with the Mac & Cheese.  My fiancé loved the pulled pork and ribs.  The best option is to get the choose four platter so that you can get a little taste of all their meats.  Make sure you save some room for dessert....the banana pudding was one of the best I have ever tasted, I literally ate it all with 2-3 minutes.  Reasonably priced and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Burned Ends were yummy, with just the right amount of fat and sauce on them. Service was a little slow. Parking can be difficult because of the small parking lot."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is great every single time I go. It's so consistent. It's the best BBQ in Charlotte. Their sauces are delish, their beer list is great, they always have great specials. Yum! This is my go to place for out of town guests.  Pro tip: They make everything fresh so they sell out quickly. Keep this in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"The waitress gave us a very comfortable ordering experience. The Midwood signature sauce is perfect! The apple cider dressing with their wonderful salad is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to admit that I dont know this kind of BBQ, so I have a hard time reviewing it because I'm use to barbequing on a grill. All that smoked and saucy shit sucks. I love the true flavor of grilled meat, without all the sauce and seasonings. My bro in law makes the best ribs, so juicy and succulent and real, no smoky flavor. With that being said, we ordered the Smoked Jalapeno popper wrapped in bacon. They were inedible, thats how hot they were. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know jalapenos are hot and I love heat, but these were horrificly hot and the smoke \"flavoring\" was so overbearing, I had to send them back. They were very understanding about that. We split the combo of ribs with coleslaw and hushpuppies. The ribs were tender and meaty and tasted good, but Not succulent and juicy and unctuous like my bro in law's. The coleslaw was a little dry, need some mayo. The hushpuppies were delicious!! They were really small tho. They were not hot, but they were crispy and oh so flavorful. We ordered dessert. I ordered Keylime pie and he ordered Banana pudding. He loved it, I didnt taste it. Mine was ok, but too cold and hard. I'll try again and the looks of the pics posted here, I'm going with the Brisket. You southerners might love this place, but its just not what I'm used to."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in Charlotte.  Now, there's not a lot of great BBQ in Charlotte and I have no idea why, but this is the best.  I love their side options, like the stuffed jalapenos.  Their brisket is also pretty good.  I love their smoked chicken.  I recommend Midwood for BBQ in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent service again. Great atmosphere (high energy but not too high). Food Ratings (5 being highest):   Smoked Wings: 5 Crispy Wings: 3 Smoked Half-Chicken: 5 French Fries: 4 Mac & Cheese: 3 (I know most people love it, but not for me).  Overall: 4.   Recommended. Might hit the bar just for some wings and Blue Moon in the future."}
{"text":"We came here for July 4th and couldn't have picked a better place for good American barbecue! Hands down the best ribs I've ever had in my life. Great Mac and cheese too! Ask for a tour of the smoker. The manager took us back to show us how everything works, and it was pretty awesome. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love it here!! We have been here a handful of times and really enjoy the food! It's a bit more on the pricier side but the food is really delicious! The Mac and cheese and brisket is absolutely mouth watering! Don't skip out on ordering the bacon wrapped jalepenos they are a staple every time we go in! The service has always been excellent and very attentive. They are great with large orders and accommodating to their clients. All the meat is very well cooked and they have amazing ribs! Honestly you can't really go wrong with what you order here. There is consistency here and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Carolina ribs in North Carolina? Woohoo! That was my thought when Grant L brought me to Midwood Smokehouse.   Instead of Carolina, I ended up getting their special Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs with Midwood signature sauce on the side. I'm sure someone can tell me the difference with Carolina ribs. My favorite ribs are Memphis style dry rub but this wasn't it. Still, it was pretty close and the Saint Louis half rack was pretty darn good.  The hushpuppies were delicious and the collard greens surprisingly tasty and not overcooked or overly salty like 75% of Southern restaurants.   Our order took awhile to get to our table but our waitress was friendly. NoDa local brew while waiting was a big plus. Watching the World Series Champion San Francisco Giants beating the Kansas City Royals on TV was an even bigger plus!"}
{"text":"Visited based on prior reviews.   There is no doubt the other 1000 people were correct.  Pork, ribs, chix and all sides were great.   Will visit again when here in the future"}
{"text":"Talk about delicious food, this place has it! Midwood catered a work event I attended and man was the food good! They brought out the bbq, hot wings & the chipotle sauce, mac & cheese, bbq beans, grilled veggies & the banana pudding! Everyone was raving about it. A big shout out to Lisa! This girl knows how to promote a business. I tried everything, twice! Yes, it was that good. I heard that I needed to get over to their actual location to try a few other items. I look forward to that & will update my review!"}
{"text":"The food here was surprising very very good. I've eaten here a few times and I enjoy every visit."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food! You always get a generous portion. Try the brisket. It is the best!"}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ and beers.  We received quick and friendly service both times we visited.  Our first time we got the combo plate to try all the meats.  Everything was great and we like the brisket and sausage the most.  The smoked wing appetizer is also highly recommended."}
{"text":"The beef is great. Their Eastern NC sauce is good. The only gripe I had is that the people working here claim that their portions are big...they are not. So as a result it's slightly overpriced. The banana pudding is the best I've ever tasted, truly amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing brisket, definitely a must try if you are here. Hands down the best waiter I have had in a long time, Joe knows his stuff and made our first experience so much better than an average waiter would have! Great selection of bourbon that will bring us back here often!"}
{"text":"Pork was very tasty, but way too salty.  I hate it when food is over-salted, because there is nothing you can do.  If it's under-salted, you can always add more at your discretion.  In general though, food quality was pretty good.  Cole slaw was not good though."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't already reviewed Midwood Smokehouse! Simply put, it stays in constant rotation for a dinner option for us. My fiancé sticks with the brisket and loves the baked beans and mac and cheese as sides. I will typically get a brisket sandwich or a chopped salad with brisket and green goddess dressing. Occasionally we get the platter with different types of meat and share that and we always have left overs. Anytime anyone comes to visit from out of town, we take them there and they always ask to come back on return visits.   Overall, amazing!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have been here, but they are remembered fondly.  We could not finish our meal so we got a to go box.  We forgot the box on the table and when we went back 5-10 minutes later they has tossed it.  They took the time to make us new food to take home.  That kind of service is not forgotten."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu looked good! The brisket tacos were delicious. My mom ordered the burnt ends and brisket... both were outstanding! The pomegranate and knob creek drink was a wonderful finish!"}
{"text":"This was just ok.  We really travel to authentic BBQ places and this fell short.  Burnt ends were not really burnt ends and the ribs although moist were just ok.  I had high hopes"}
{"text":"Great gluten free options (thanks other reviewers), including a separate gluten free menu. Delicious ribs. Mediocre bacon jalapeno side. Great beer and cocktail selection and overall a really pleasant experience. We came around 1:30pm and didn't have to wait at all.  We hoped to walk back to Charlotte from the restaurant but there was a lot of construction in early fall 2017. So we wound up cabbing, which was worth it since everyone needed a nap after all the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Wow.... had no idea this place existed. Was over visiting some friends in Plaza Midwood, and they said we just had to Try this place. Ended up ordering the Chicken BBQ Plate with hushpuppies and Mac n Cheese. OMG the South Carolina Mustard Sauce they use is like freaking CRACK.... it was amazing. The hushpuppies were just okay, but the Mac n Cheese was awesome!!! I ordered the small plate but it was a perfect meal. I am huge Jim n Nicks and Mac's Fan, but this place sorta has them beat in my mind at the moment. The prices were also Great!!! Definitely recommend checking them out if you haven't yet!!!"}
{"text":"Since midwood was more convenient to my house I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did the food was really good and wasn't as expensive as I thought. I got the bbq sandwich with bbq slaw and collard greens and added on a side of ribs which came up to 21.50! Not bad. The waiter was very helpful and nice and the atmosphere was pretty chill. The sandwich was good the bread was toasted and buttery just right! The collards were good The ribs were good but I've had better. The bbq sauce was really good. Overall I enjoyed and will definitely be back to try more things off the menu. You should try it."}
{"text":"Not a lot to choose when you vegan it but god was good service was ok little tension was in the air but would come again for last min eat of grilled cheese"}
{"text":"We ordered via Door Dash. Was our first time trying Midwood. Meals were prepared very fast (delivered fast op) but ah! such wonderful bbq!!! Husband was very pleased with the brisket (and the fact that you could choose lean or fatty meat!) and he really liked the bbq sauce that came with. I had a bbq sandwich with slaw, sandwich was amazing but the slaw was a little bland - but still good. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"It was my guy's and I first time traveling through Charlotte, N.C. and Yelp helped us choose the barbecue joint we were going to patronize on our first night in town. I am really glad we chose Midwood Smokehouse.   We walked in and were seated immediately at one of the high-top tables. Our server greeted us right away and recommended a couple of North Carolina brews to try and both of us enjoyed the beer we received, which scores points for the place right off the bat.   After asking the server a few questions (which she politely and knowledgeably answered) we decided on the beef brisket and the smoked half-chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket which I felt had so much flavor that it did not need any additional sauce. The chicken was slightly dry but when paired with the sauces, both my partner and I thought was absolutely delicious. We did ask our server to bring a side of every sauce so we may try them. (I loved the spicy habanero.)  For side items I ordered for myself the bite-sized bacon-wrapped jalapeños which were rich and spicy all at once. We also shared the mac 'n' cheese and the BBQ baked beans. My bf fell in love with the mac 'n' cheese while I swooned over the beans which contained pieces of pulled-pork, adding a lot of flavor to that particular side dish.   All-in-all, Midwood's was the best BBQ place we had traveling through both North Carolina and Tennessee. I would definitely revisit if I'm ever back in the area. I'm still thinking about it a week later.   I recommend walking upstairs and enjoying a sweet view of the city after dinner."}
{"text":"My entire experience was awesome!  The food was delicious and the service was on point! I kept saying I wanted to try the place and today was the day!  My coworker and I both had the midwood chopped except hers was with BBQ chicken and I had chopped pork.  We both ordered a small and it was more than enough!  For an appetizer we had the BBQ queso and it was yummy! We nibbled on that while we were eating our salads because it was so good!  Our server Amanda was awesome and really pulled together our experience.  She educated us on the menu and top sellers.  I will definitely tell others in my office and go back soon!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was phenomenal! The only downside was that my husband and one of the other friends we were with got sick from the cole slaw. I feel pretty confident that it was just a bad batch."}
{"text":"The midwood chopped salad is the best salad and best deal in town!"}
{"text":"So... I really wanted to like this location, but it's just not as good as the Central Ave location. For starters, the food isn't consistent each time I come.  I've had good Mac and cheese here and then I've had horrible Mac and cheese here. The staff is definitely friendly but it doesn't make up for the inconsistent food being sold here.  Also, this location doesn't have the fried Mac and cheese which the Central Ave location does.  There are two main perks with this location.... 1. I haven't had them run out of food, like the central Ave location. 2. The place is definitely more spacious.  All in all.... I would visit again since it's close to my job, but when it's the weekend, I would rather go all the way to Central Ave than to go to the location that's 10 minutes away from my house"}
{"text":"Mehhhhh. So many Charlotte natives love Midwood Smokehouse, but unfortunately I'm not one of them. I ordered the BBQ with a side of baked beans. The hushpuppies were the only thing on the plate that I enjoyed. The BBQ was super dry, and the baked beans were cold. Maybe I caught them on a bad night.   My fiancé had the beef rib for $40. It was expensive but he enjoyed it, and this is why I'm awarding 3 stars (based on his experience rather than mine).   Overall, I would give this restaurant another try because so many of my friends like it."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here from out of town on my first visit.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  The menu was large and included a gluten-free menu (although the waiter couldn't locate it) for those who request it.  It was very busy on a Saturday night, so expect to wait for a table.  I did not have the BBQ meat but everyone said it was delicious.  I believe they had a decent drink menu/ liquor selection too!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the uptown location. This location is closer to home so we decided to try it. Don't like it. Uptown is more of a bar with less children. This location is a family restaurant. Totally different. I'll be driving uptown from now on."}
{"text":"The back of the house deserves a better front of the house representing them. I've visited multiple times and it seems to be the same routine....great food/angry servers. I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm just unlucky"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to stop by Midwood Smokehouse because the map showed that it was in the middle of an outdoor mall; however, the hubby and I were super hungry and craving bbq. Boy, I am glad we stopped. The service was great. The drinks were really good, especially the spicy mule drink....sorry I have no idea what the name is. The food was excellent. We sampled the beef, chicken and pork. I would say that the beef and pork were our favorites. We got our check before being asked about the dessert menu, but we were so full we most likely would have passed. Anyhow, if you are looking for a delicious, solid meal be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Wow! Great brisket and the mac and cheese is to die for! You got to check this place out! Service was fabulous and I will sooo be conming back for more brisket!"}
{"text":"The bacon-wrapped jalopenos are UH-mazing. My life is now complete.  Seriously though, this place is awesome if you're looking for BBQ. My husband and I went there with our church one Sunday after service. We had a large party and would have had to wait quite a bit to be seated if we sat inside, so they took us out to the heated patio and sat us there instead. The weather wasn't bad, so it worked out well.   My husband was on a no-sugar diet at the time, so it was a bit difficult to find food that he could eat, but they were very accommodating, and our server made sure to double check that what he ordered was okay for him to eat. We did end up cheating a bit with the jalopenos but it was definitely worth it.   Whenever he can eat like a normal person again, we'll definitely revisit. Since going there, we've made our own version of bacon-wrapped jalopenos at home - but using goat cheese since he can't do cow's milk dairy - and they were pretty good. Nothing beats the app at Midwood though."}
{"text":"My initial visit to Midwood Smokehouse was shortly after they opened.  We were extremely excited to have a legit BBQ place open in the neighborhood and were eager to try it.  We loved the smoked meat and were not pleased with the sides.  I have since been back recently and they have not been stagnant, instead they have improved a lot of things.  The smoked meet is still great and the sides have vastly improved.  Being a Mac n Cheese fan, their's is definitely up there.  The most recent visit I had one of the most delicious sandwiches ever.  It was a burger made from ground smoked brisket, topped with pepper jack cheese and a healthy serving of pulled pork.  I actually can't stop thinking about how good it was."}
{"text":"This joint is located in Plaza Midwood and I think is very good! I've gotten the brisket, pulled pork, and mac and cheese which were all excellent."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today. Out of ribs at 4pm but it was Father's Day, so it's understandable. On the waitresses recommendation, I ordered the supposedly one pound beef rib. When it arrived me and my wife both looked at each other saying that's one pound of meat. It was cooked right with good flavor but no where near a pound of beef. I made mention to the waitress and she kind of agreed with me. She said she mentioned it to the manager but nothing was taken off the bill. Oh, the meal price was $28.00 which if it was a full pound of meat would be worth it. My wife could not get ribs, so she ordered a burger which she said was good. I guess I should have ordered the burnt ends which I originally wanted. Not saying I will not return but you would think that first time customers with an issue would be comped in some way.....anyway, my dog is happy, he's currently chewing on the rib bone which probably made up close to 1/2 of the one pound weight....."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the location but I did not enjoy this go around at the Johnston location. We had to ask for each sauce, rather than all coming out at the same time... And the $30 rib was mostly fat. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Kristen gave such amazing service that in itself is worth 5 stars. Best bbq in Charlotte"}
{"text":"After two visits, Midwood Smokehouse BBQ and Bar has become my current favorite BBQ place in Charlotte.  I say current, as things can happen to take that status (and it's an important one) away.  One only needs to ask me about Mac's Speedshop where starting back in 2006 I would frequent at least once a month.  After too many instances of stale sandwich buns, so-so service, and so-so 'Cue...I haven't been back in probably 2 years.     A few weeks ago on a bright and warm Saturday, some of my friends came in from out-of -town to visit the CLT and they were looking for some tasty BBQ.  In the past this would have been a quick drive over to Mac's in the Southend.  However, this time I was searching my Yelp app for a new king of 'Cue.  This search took me to my first visit to the, Plaza Midwood located, Midwood Smokehouse BBQ/ Bar and my new number one.  Atmosphere - Crowded, lively, and happening, a darkly lit and noisy bar area, a bright and a little calmer dining room, and a packed with patrons patio space.  Service - Despite our server seeming crushed from the craziness that a nice day brings to a place with a patio, he kept it together and provided prompt service.  The server was quick and thoughtful in offering suggestions, though I knew what I wanted to have...the Carolina Pork BBQ Plate.  Food - Great!  As mentioned above I ordered the Carolina Pork BBQ Plate.  I opted for the small portion, which comes with hushpuppies, pickled onions, and one side (I ordered sweet potato fries).  Despite being busy, the food arrived quickly and hot.  I tasted some of the pulled pork immediately before dressing it with the table placed sauces...it was excellent!  While Midwood Smokehouse does lightly dress the pulled pork in their Eastern NC vinegar sauce prior to serving, all I could taste was smoky goodness.  The pork was lean, flavorful, and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were good and the hushpuppies on this visit were awesome, with a light crunch and a soft, cake donut like center.  Everything was perfect!    Being a bar too, Midwood Smokehouse has a nice selection of beers, including the local offerings from OMB, Triple C Brewing, and NODA.       Overall - While you may have read this review and expected to see a 5 Star rating...I gave 4 Stars.  Why 4 Stars??  Well, as stated in the beginning of my review it was the result of two visits that made Midwood Smokehouse my king of 'Cue.  The absence of a star comes down to consistency.  I was so enamored on my first visit, as described above, my second visit occurred a mere four days later.  It was a Wednesday; the shine had come off on my new trophy winner.  While the pulled pork on this visit was just as good the portion seemed a little smaller and the hushpuppies I received to me seemed dry and old tasting.  Despite a little downturn on my second visit, I think the solid nature of their pulled pork makes Midwood Smokehouse some of the best BBQ Charlotte has to offer.  With that I will be back again with friends!"}
{"text":"This is top three barbeque spot in all of Charlotte. I have been here a few times and honestly the quality and quantity of food are always good here.  They actual have really good tasting drafts if you are into beer with daily specials too. We ordered the pimento cheese fries as this is how pimento cheese should taste ! I have had it with brisket before and that is good enough for a meal. I had the brisket sandwich and it is really good of course as you can tell they take time to prepare their meat.   My favorite along with just about everyone's are the burnt ends. Must try! If you need to google burnt ends please do... but you must try them here!  Be warned that the parking it limited here and you will probably wait to get into this place.   This BBQ is well worth the wait and maybe  possible do a uber or lyft here because you can walk to Workman's friend , Legion, Whiskey Warehouse , or wherever afterwards."}
{"text":"Wow! Best BBQ I've ever had. Excellent smoked wings. Amazing sausage. Great pulled pork. And the brisket was good. They sold out of the ribs so I'll have to try those next time."}
{"text":"Who can go to North Carolina and not get some BBQ? Unfortunately, Charlotte is not one of the main BBQ hubs in the state. Midwest Smokehouse, however, serves up some delicious BBQ.  The Smoked Wings ($8) is a pound of chicken wings that are smoked then finished on the grill. They were meaty, but still tender and had the right amount of smoke. My mouth is watering just thinking about them they were so good.  The Combo Platter (Well Fed $24) comes with your choice of 4 proteins. We chose pulled pork which was smoky and delicious; beef brisket which was tender and full of flavor with just the right amount of fat; burnt ends which had a nice char and a juicy fat cap; and some St. Louis style pork ribs which were fall off the bone tender. The platter comes with pickled onions and hush puppies, which were tender with a nice corn flavor. You also get 2 sides, in our case we got the mac & cheese which was rich and creamy, and the bacon wrapped jalapenos which didn't pack too much of a punch but had a great crispy bacon coating.  We got the bread pudding, which was soggy (I like it this way) studded with raisins. The ice cream helped to added another layer of richness and creaminess to the dish. Would get this again.  The Banana Pudding ($5.50) was a very large portion of vanilla pudding with loads of bananas and vanilla wafers. I think they folded in some whipped cream as the dish was actually somewhat light. Between the two desserts, this was the bigger hit.  Midwest Smokehouse puts out some good food which explains the lines and packed house. This is a solid choice to get your BBQ fix in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place deserves 6 stars but that's not an option. Even the ice cubes are amazing!! They have the ball ice cubes.  We got the pimento fries with brisket which was probably the best thing I've ever eaten.  Then we got the combo plate with chicken, pork, brisket, and sausage. My favorite meat was the chicken, it comes in a great sauce. Our sides were the bacon wrapped jalepenos and Mac and cheese. To top it all off the service was probably the best service in a restaurant I've had in a long time. Everyone was so charming, especially our waitress Nickey."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind: miserable. As in \"I am miserably full cause I couldn't stop eating!\" First time eater and fully impressed. Tacos were excellent. Burnt ends were fairly insane. Bacon wrapped jalapeño gave me a new reason to live. And the pimento cheese fries were a delight. Service was attentive. Beer selection was ample. Not sure what else I can say. We are driving home complaining about how much our tummies hurt. Will be back."}
{"text":"While Memphis style barbecue will always be first in my heart, Midwood serves up great BBQ NC style. Brisket was dope, the Nacho Libres was the perfect balance of queso, jalapeños, and BBQ, the only thing that was wanting was their collard greens. Need more vinegar/flavor please. Other than that, this place is solid."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this place. I have been a long time customer and my experience this evening was so poor, that I will not be returning. If I was the owner of Midwood, I would honestly be embarrassed by the service I received tonight. I waited for a pick up order for over 30 minutes past my pick up time. When the order finally came out, it was wrong! When I asked to speak to the manager, he wasn't even apologetic. It was as if it was a chore to deal with a customer who had every right to be frustrated. He did not offer to right their wrong, in fact he offered me nothing! I got my money back and left. You can do better than this Midwood. Hope it was worth losing a long time customer."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on reviews on Yelp. We shared a combo platter with 2 adults and a child with an additional order of hush puppies. It was 6oz of 4 different smoked meats plus 2 sides. Was more than enough for all of us. The ribs were my favorite."}
{"text":"Always take family and friends visiting from out of town here. Try the Carolina Pork, so good!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bias having lived in Texas for a year.. I feel like I have had my share of excellent and renowned  bbq. I came to midwood via yelp recommendation for some good bbq in the area. It was easy enough to get a table for 2 at lunch time on a Sunday. The menu is pretty big.. it's a restaurant as well as a bbq joint.. so you can get salads and sandwiches too. My friend and I split the combo platter- chopped chicken, chopped pork, brisket, and pork ribs, Mac n cheese, and beans. I enjoyed about half the plate- the brisket, ribs, and Mac m cheese were good-- not better than Texas.. but still tasty enough.   The chicken and chopped pork were so forgettable. In fact it was hard to tell the difference between the 2 chopped meats. This is definitely a rib joint! They have a limited number of beef ribs too.. but at $29/each I am skeptical! They weren't even that much in Texas.   Plenty of seating.. indoors and outdoors. Very casual place. Service was good and there appeared to be daily drink specials."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Way better than the previous Sticky Fingers. This location is definitely better than the NoDa and the service is way more friendly. We ordered some brisket in our combo plate and when they had sold out they let us do double ribs for free (normally a decent size up charge to do double ribs). Their collard greens are definitely my favorite side."}
{"text":"Best. BBQ. In. Charlotte. Get the sampler platter and as many bacon wrapped, cheese stuffed smoked jalapeños as possible and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food with huge servings! I split the four meats plate and we got brisket, BBQ, chicken, and ribs with mac and cheese and fries. K honestly don't know what my favorite part was! The atmosphere is really neat and so welcoming. I would absolutely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"When a line for BBQ is out the door, you know its good. The brisket was the perfect blend of lean and fatty meat and smoked to perfection. It was served with a side of hush puppies, and I chose the BBQ cole slaw as my side of choice. I didn't quite get the BBQ flavor from the slaw, but it so pretty tasty none the less. It was a busy night, but our server did a great job of keeping our beverages topped off and bellies full."}
{"text":"I saw that a new BBQ place had opened up and had to go try it.  I ate lunch there on a Saturday just a little before noon.  The restaurant was nice, with an industrial feel to it, but very well done.  It had your standard decorations.  The place is kind of narrow, but the arrangement worked well for the space with a mixture of booths & high top tables.  The do have a deck outside with seats.  There were maybe one or two tables when I got there, so I could pretty much sit anywhere.  My server took my drink order and when she came back I asked if they had any sort of combo platter where I could try a little of each meat.  She said they might and went to check for me.  After a couple of minutes a different server came back and said they don't currently have a combo platter, but he showed me a new menu with it.  It was a choice of 4 meats & two sides.  I chose chicken, ribs, pork & brisket with baked beans and coleslaw for my sides.  It took a while for my food to come out.  When Peter, my server brought it out, the plate was enormous.  It had a  chicken, breast & wing, 5 ribs, a pile of chopped pork & a couple of slices of brisket.  There were also some hush puppies and pickled onions on the plate.  The sides where served in soup cups and there was also a plate with three different sauces.  Peter went over everything explaining the different types of sauces.  There was a vinegar based, mustard based, and a tomato based sauce.  The brisket was sliced thick with a bit of fat in it.  The pork was chopped fine and mixed with a little of the mustard based sauce.  The ribs were served dry and the chicken had some of the mustard based sauce on it.    The brisket was tender and juicy with a nice dark bark on it.  When I first tried the bark I thought it might have been a little over smoked, but with more of the meat it was had a very nice balance.  My only complaint on the brisket was that it was sliced with the grain instead of across it.  The brisket was cooked long enough that it was still tender, but cut correctly it would have been better.    The pork was awesome!  Very tender and moist with a nice flavor.  The mustard sauce was a nice compliment to the pork.  I tried some of the vinegar based sauce, but didn't care for it as much as the mustard based.  The ribs were a little undercooked, but still tender enough with a nice flavor.  The ribs would have been much better with about another hour or two of cooking.  The chicken was tender and moist with a good flavor.  Nothing too special about it, but it was still good.  The baked beans had a nice flavor and had pieces of meat mixed in with them.  They also had chunks of onion and pepper.  There was a seasoning, like oregano or coriander, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  It was a different and I couldn't quite decide if it worked on not, but it must have since I ate most of them.  The coleslaw was meh, but you don't go to BBQ places just for the coleslaw.  The service was awesome here, Peter noticed when he brought my food out that the brisket had some fat on it so he brought a plate with some lean brisket, a little more pork and a slice of sausage for me to try.   I've tried a lot of the BBQ places in Charlotte since I've been here and Midwood Smokehouse is at the top of the list if not the best.  The price was very good for the amount of food as well, $16 for the combo plate.  With the extra meat Peter brought I couldn't finish it all, which is saying something.  With great service and reasonable prices I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the NoDa version of this place twice and while it was good I have to say the 521 location is better. Our waitress was spot on and she took care of us the whole way. I almost let go of the steering wheel she was so good.   Just as a preface...I smoke bbq at my house often and have eaten it all over the country, just look at my profile pic. I've actually stopped eating bbq unless it's a special occasion because so many places are let downs. This place isn't a let down so start driving now if you're considering.   We started with the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno's which are money. I don't order straight up bbq anymore so I had the taco's. Well thought out and executed as I would do them. I had to do the hushpuppies and they were worth cheating with fried foods. My son did the brisket sammich, I tasted it and they did a good job on it.   It was lunch time so I didn't order beer but they have a cool bar with tons of different beers. I may have to come back after 5 for some beers.   I will go back when in the area and so should you...always good to have a legit bbq joint in the hood near me. Just an FYI my dad went here three days ago on my advice and did order the straight up ribs, pulled pork and brisket. He's into bbq too and said it was spot on."}
{"text":"Enjoying a lazy Sunday before Sunday night prime time football between Packers & Steelers (28-31). Being a Packer fan i frequent Angry Ale's so decided to try some restaurants in the area.   Original idea was to visit another spot but how can you see BBQ and not want some.  The service was great, food was great and everyone was very personable and attentive. We were talked into trying the Massive Beef Ribs and when i say it's Massive that is an understatement. The beef basically melted right off the bone and cooked to perfection. Also had the lean Beef Brisket with Mac & Cheese which was also excellent. I'll definitely be getting this again but as a sandwich something about bread and Brisket that just sounds right .   Overall, excellent visit and we'll come back again. Just hopping this wasn't a fluke and the service is 5 Star next time. We arrived around noon so I would be interested to see how it is during the evening hours."}
{"text":"Oh yea! BBQ at its finest! The burnt ends are worth the wait. I have been coming here long before Hilary and Obama came and I can honestly say they got it right every time! The wings, the salads, the sandwiches, and the sides make this a BBQ standard. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't compliment this place enough! Casual but classy atmosphere with friendly staff and amazing food, what more could someone ask for? Came in on a Saturday afternoon, pretty busy for 3 o'clock. Our waitress was out of this world. So often you get a waitperson who is either lacksidasical in their service or smothering in their concern, but not Rachel. She was friendly and conversational, funny and witty really enjoyed her making us feel at home. Being from NC, BBQ means one thing...Pork, but their burnt ends are to die for. If I could eat it everyday I would, seriously at good.   PUMPKIN LOVERS- get the Gordgeous beer from NoDa Brewing Co....probably one of the best pumpkin beers I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely kind here.  This was my first time trying NC bbq; I do live in KC, but don't have a marked preference for a certain kind of American BBQ.  I ordered the small plate of burnt ends + a side of pulled pork (I know, I know... a side of meat, but it's only 3 oz., and I really wanted to try it since pulled pork is one of my faves.  Good thing I ordered it because the burnt ends were not where it was at; burnt ends came out cold and chewy -- not fork tender and delicious.  Apparently the burnt ends were a weekly special (or something like that), and they were so popular they became a permanent staple on the menu.  They came with a fat tire bbq sauce that I didn't really care for.  The pulled pork, on the other hand was much, much better, and I also enjoyed the sharp vinegar-y flavors of the sauce.  I also tried the bacon-wrapped jalapenos (nice heat, and the bacon adds so much incredible flavor) which were the best things I ate at this spot.  The hush puppies were alright; they did come out hot, but not being from the south -- maybe I don't get hush puppies / don't know how they're supposed to taste; these particular ones were dense and chewy.  Not my favorite.   It feels kind of dirty in here... not the kind of dirty you'd notice immediately, but there are a lot of flies here and the place feels a little grimy... but this is a bar, after all.    All that being said, I want to circle back to how great the service was.  My server asked how the food was tasting, and when it comes to how tasty the food is, I don't mess around :), and I (gently) let her know that the burnt ends weren't up to par.  She offered to replace it with another type of meat, but I wasn't too eager to try anything else, so she actually just comped part of my meal, and I ended up paying for my iced tea and a couple of bucks for my pulled pork side.  After all of that, I'm just ambivalent about this place... if you do go, don't get the burnt ends, though."}
{"text":"I have previously reviewed this place, but I returned again and I tried the Pecan Cobbler.    It was a religious experience... the Pecan Cobbler is the kind of thing that wars could be fought over.   It was perhaps the BEST dessert that I have EVER had in my life.  I don't want to over play it, but it was served warm with a scoop of really good ice cream.     GET THE PECAN COBBLER!   What helps is that you eat all of this salty BBQ food and then finish it with a sweet cobbler.   Epic experience."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the Mid Wood Smokehouse. I regularly go to the Plaza Midwood location but this location is closer to my house and I was overjoyed to get some smokehouse a little closer to home.   A good friend of mine told me the Smokehouse had opened and I sprinted over... I am not sure if this location has recently opened or if they're smoker just wasn't up to par completely yet... but something was definitely different about this experience.   Don't get me wrong- the service was amazing as usual, the decor was local and lively... everything was basically great... except the Beef Brisket... now I am a beef girl and I like my beef brisket to have some fat and some char on it. But these particular slices of brisket were so smoky in flavor - my mouth literally tasted like I had ash inside my mouth. Again - don't get me wrong... the meat was tender and even juicy in spaces.. but the overwhelming char, fire, smoke taste over powered my ability to enjoy this meal.   I'm convinced this experience was some type of insane weird flawed evening - so I will return and update my review with hopefully better news about the smokehouse brisket.   Now - as for the other sides.... awesome and amazing... per my usual - mach and cheese and the hush puppies that created my love for hush puppies were amazing."}
{"text":"This is literally where I go everytime I'm thinking about BBQ.... I have a true Charlottean village of family surrounding me and they usually laugh at me when I suggest BBQ places to go but Midwood saves my Hyde everytime.  Beef brisket!!"}
{"text":"Great bbq food with a variety of bbq sauces. Definitely would recommend it to others in the area. Their fried pickles are excellent."}
{"text":"Every seems to agree this is the place to go if you only have one nigh in Charlotte. 44 and 45ish seem to agree, and I can see why. Don't skip the bacon wrapped jalapeños."}
{"text":"I prefer the plaza mid wood location. This location doesn't seem as warm. The food seems a little different as well. Just a lil."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch experience!!  Our server was outstanding too (wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shout out)!  The meal was scrumptious from the apps to dessert!  I think I may have found my go to BBQ spot and that's saying a LOT!  Brought leftovers home to my hubby and he was impressed as well.  Will return and soon!"}
{"text":"I picked up a large catering order yesterday before noon. The service was over the top and the food the same. I highly recommend Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and thought the brisket was really good. Moist, not dry. Sauce with it was good. Mac and cheese was also good. Wasn't a fan of the hush puppies but i don't have anything to compare them too, so maybe i just don't like hush puppies. I got my food to-go from the bar."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch at Midwood Smokehouse and was delighted to grab a table outside. A beautiful day and a much-hyped BBQ shop had the makings of a great meal. I've been searching for a great BBQ shop. I went into the meal hoping I had found a great local BBQ shop.  I ordered a Small Pulled Pork Plate and was delighted when the meal came out in no more than 3 minutes. Love that.  The very friendly and attentive waitress claimed that the meal was 8oz of meat and the menu also claimed that the pork was PULLED. I must have done a poor job of hiding my confusion when the meal was delivered because the waitress asked if everything was ok. I pointed out the obvious fact that the pork was chopped and not pulled. Apparently, they pull the pork apart...and then chop it. In my book, that's called chopped. Chopped and Pulled are two different meals. I won't be convinced otherwise and I won't be fooled.   I suspect that there wasn't quite 8oz of meat, but forgot my digital scale.  Putting the texture discrepancy aside, the BBQ was seasoned very well. I'm a fan of a sweeter BBQ and tend to shy away from vinegar-based sauces. The BBQ was seasoned so well that the side of vinegar sauce was unnecessary. The side of baked beans had great texture and were seasoned to perfection(sweet), but was a small side. Mixing the BBQ and the beans together, I found my sweet flavorful BBQ.   I was unimpressed with the hush-puppies but my four-legged companion liked them. I'm sure she would give them two-paws up. She likes hush-puppies but I've never had one I really liked.   Overall, the food was pretty good but I have to admit I was disappointed at the prices. The portions were small for the amount of money. The small plate was in the range of $9 and only came with one side. I couldn't justify to my self spending $3 to get an extra side. After seeing the size of the sides, I made the right choice.   Midwood Smokehouse is a good concept and has the makings of a great BBQ joint, but they've really missed it on portion size."}
{"text":"I love that they open d one up here in Birkdale. Everytime we come here, the food is always so good. Yesterday my husbands chicken for his salad was a bit dry.  Other than that, this place has been fairly consistent: good bbq."}
{"text":"What a great new local restaurant for the Midwood hood. The server explained that the menu will be enlarged soon to offer more vegetarian and healthy meals. But even the way the menu is now is great.   The Saint Louis style ribs were absolutely perfect--very meaty, smoked to perfection, and very tender. The special Plaza Midwood bbq sauce is a perfect compliment. The baked beans were very flavorful. The outdoor seating is very nice, though the indoor seating seems a little cramped. Overall, this was a great experience, and I will be going back tonight for more!"}
{"text":"BBQ at its finest! It's always amazing to me when I can eat bbq That I don't have to put sauce on! This place was phenomenal! Portions are huge...this place is serious! I had the pimento fries with brisket, smoked wings, and brisket sandwich on Texas toast and my wife ordered a sampler that had 4 meats ( ribs, brisket, chicken ,pork) . The sides were up to par with the main dishes, the Mac and cheese, collard, the cream corn....crazy flavor! Whenever I go back to Charlotte, going back! Now I need to find comparable in my city"}
{"text":"Such wonderful service here. The food however was just fine. The wings I got were VERY pink inside and I only ate a few because I wasn't sure if they were supposed to look like that. The hush puppies were ok. The BBQ was very dry. Wasn't a fan of the sauces. Everyone seems to love this place so maybe we just got an unlucky meal. Good sized portions for kids meals though.   Oh just a tip----the heated patio feels like you're being microwaved. Was nice and quiet out there but under the heat lamp my scalp felt like it was burning and I had to move seats.   Cool place but there's better BBQ around."}
{"text":"Really great BBQ...my only wish is that they would add a fish entree. Other than my little quirky wish they give you all you want in a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Smells amazing when you walk in...tons of food, and very friendly staff!  I left completely stuffed, and content.  Staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great selection of Bourbon. The service was quick warm and very helpful as this is my first time here. The recommendation of the Beef Brisket with Mac N Cheese was amazing. Every bite I was in heaven. Business is taken me west but I'll be back on Thursday to enjoy one last me before flying home to Oregon. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good Q. Generous portion. Collards are worth getting. Service was super. Asked for outside cut and they said they could not accomodate that request but it came about half and half which was perfect anyway. Have to go back and try the ribs. They looked great. Worth the drive. Parking can be a challenge at lunch rush hour, so arrive before or after the peak."}
{"text":"Always go to the same place for BBQ, deciding to change things up and went to Midwood.  Flying solo so sat at the bar.  The service at the bar was excellent-my server was quick to pour me a beer and get me a menu-very friendly and attentive! To compare to my favorite place, I ordered similar items--beef brisket, collard greens and baked beans.  The plate also came with hush puppies. The portion was excellent, and don't leave hungry-good value for the food.  The brisket had a little fat, which made it moist, and good smoke.  They offer the BBQ sauces on the side - a vinegar base and tomato base sauce, I stayed with the tomato based sauce. Overall, the food was good, and the service was excellent! I've had their burnt ends before and thought they were excellent.  Some BBQ joints only offer the burnt ends as an appetizer, this place it's a meal with sides.  I will definitely be back, as the server also told me they do a burnt ends with Pork!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to the area and this restaurant was my first meal here. The server was very very friendly and gave us tons of recommendations (to be honest it was almost not helpful because there were too many). I had a beef brisket sandwich and Mac n cheese on the side. My colleague had brisket with bacon wrapped jalapeños. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I found this place via my trusty YELP app. Me and my buddy decide to come here after the Nascar race got rained out. We get there and the host told us that they are out of ribs and pulled pork. But thats what we came here for? But from what it looks like one of the owners said that those two items would be ready within 30 minutes. My buddy said lets just stay here only because it will probably take us that long to decide on where to go instead, then drive there, then sit, then order. SO we just said, lets just eat here.  We put our name down and asked for a booth, and they said there might be a wait, I said no problem because we had 30minutes to wait for the stuff we wanted anyways.  Our server, i forgot his name was really nice. We browse the menu and pretty much know what we wanted.  I ordered that plate that had a little bit of everything and my buddy just had the pulled pork.   We get our food fairly fast, it didn't even feel like we waited that long for anything. When I get my plate, everything looked amazing! The bacon wrapped jalepeno's was awesome. The baked beans was home made. the hush puppies i couldn't stop eating.  As for my meats. The thing i loved the most was the brisket. It was hands down the best brisket I have ever tried. My next favorite was the pulled pork, and the Ribs and sausage I did not care for. The ribs looked amazing but it fell flat for me in terms of flavor. The sausage was nothing really to write home about. Oh i forgot to mention i LOVED the pickled onions. Wish I got more on my plate.  But other then that, this place gets a solid 4 star in my book. I'll most defiantly be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"two words: brisket tacos. I ordered the two taco plate with one pork one brisket... the brisket was ah-maz-ing... I wanted to trade in my pork taco for another it was that good. I ended up saving the pork taco for the next day, it was really good left over and tasty in its own right but the brisket blew it out of the water. BF had the pork plate w/mac n cheese, he said the pork was too smoky for his liking (we eat Mac's a lot)... I didnt think he tasted overly smokey but to each their own. The food here is good, staff is super nice and they have a lot of options (no burgers thou!)."}
{"text":"Ate there on Mothers Day and NO WAIT for seating or food this time! YEA! I got the Cuban sandwich (I AM Cuban, from Miami) which was a fair sandwich for being done in NC, but NOT a true Cuban sandwich. Still, it WAS tasty and huge and the bread (which waiter told me is flown in daily from Tampa) was the best! I got the coleslaw as my side...decent slaw, not vinegar, not milky type. My son got the pork plate with mac n cheese and slaw sides. He is a strapping young man, hungry...and the portions filled him well. We got one of the bacon wrapped jalapeno appetizers and they are decent, too. Ours were cold when served, but tasty and I will go by and get them 'as a meal' from now on. Their margarita is tasty...enough alcohol and good tasting mix. Son got two different beers, one the Blue Moon, the other I didn't sample as I was driving. We'd sat on the patio in the evening before it got dark...nice! We'd go back again. I did notice that you can get a plate of sides, differing amounts, and I often eat strange like that (gastric bypass past). That way I'd have several meals of several healthy foods, but I'll be a regular bacon wrapped jalapenos peep IF they'll cook them to order so I get them HOT."}
{"text":"We are very happy that Midwood decided to make our neighborhood their next home.  Food was excellent as always, but the service was even better.  We were blessed with Jocelyn (unsure of spelling) and she was impressive, super attentive, friendly, and warm.  The manager checked in on all the tables and we gave him great feedback.  I had the chopped pork, my husband had the ribs, and our son had the chicken tenders; no complaints, everything was great.  We did start with the BBQ queso with brisket and it was average at best, not a do-over.  The banana pudding was also not a do-over, all whipped cream and no pudding.  Overall, an excellent place for dinner and we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a barbecue fan, so I'll start off by giving that disclaimer. That said, I usually don't mind when friends want to go to a barbecue place because they always have really great sides. Not the case here. I wanted to like it so badly; I have been two or three times in an attempt to appease the friends I'm with ... and I'm just not happy with it. I wish they would focus a little more on their sides ... then I would be all about it!"}
{"text":"Never fails with the Midwood chopped salad! Open late so always our go-to for takeout!! The large makes two meals for me so I always get extra green goddess dressing! So delicious!"}
{"text":"I like Midwood Smokehouse usually go to Plaza Midwood. The service at this location was really poor. The food came first asked the waitress for water and never got it. In fact never came at all for a drink order. We ate our dinner without a beverage other than leftover from the bar.   She finally came to our table after dinner was complete. I asked why we never got a drink period and she said she'd get a manager. Just a real \"BITCH\"!  We had an angry exchange. The manager was trying to be helpful but the damage was done. If she worked for me I would have fired her on the spot! Absolutely awful. My grandson knows the owner and I will write to him to make him aware. Really bad experience!"}
{"text":"Although not strictly a \"Carolina-style\" Barbecue restaurant this is a great BBQ place with something for everyone and excellent food and drinks overall. While the pulled pork is good, the ribs, brisket and sausage here is also excellent and if you are going as a group you should order a \"Pig Out\" platter where you can choose 4 different meats. Beverage program includes cocktails made with local moonshine and as well as a comprehensive wine list. Be sure to try the banana pudding, the pecan cobbler (served warm) and the chocolate mousse pie."}
{"text":"First and last time eating at Midwood. Restaurant has a 95 inspection score from health department. Nacho appetizer came out with something that had \"legs\" on it . No one ate any and we notified staff. Waitress picked it up, said it was burnt onions, and took off with it. What ever! There were no onions on the nacho. We did not eat any of the appetizer and left it to the side. A man came by and asked if we wanted Nacho's boxed and we told him that something weird was on the nacho's and we did not want them . We ended up being credited for the nacho's but it ruined the meal. I assume what ever it was fell from the hood in the kitchen. Either way it was really gross!"}
{"text":"Dan enjoyed his pulled pork BBQ player with the mac and cheese and hush puppies. He asked me to give this a 4-star.   I just had a grilled cheese with broccoli. Two of my favorite things. It was okay. I'm not into smoked meats but veg options were available. The old fashioned was okay.   We are at the bar and service was good. That's about it (it was election day so we were preoccupied)  Parking. Let's just get this out of the way. It can't be good anywhere in this area."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Great smoke on all the meats. Service was outstanding and will be back."}
{"text":"BBQ time!  The great: sauces were very tasty, especially that vinegar sauce on the pork! Mac and cheese was bomb. A baked mac topped with cheddar combined with a cheese sauce to resist dryout: the way it's supposed to be. (If you're thinking \"obviously,\" I agree but somehow a lot of places still serve casserole mac sans cheese sauce and it just doesn't work.)   The good: pork was slightly too dry, relying completely on the vinegar sauce. I would have liked it to be more moist on its own, but with plenty of sauce, it still worked. The bacon wrapped jalapenos had wonderful flavor but the bacon was somewhat undercooked. These mugs should be crispy outside, not chewy.  The okay: the chicken! way too dry! No amount of mustard sauce could moisten it up. Here's a tip from a real actual one-time barbecuer at a restaurant that, (no dis, it's just the truth) made better BBQ than y'all: If you're hot-holding your meats with the lid off, you need to periodically add stock to keep the moisture up. If not, toss it on your flat top and give it a squirt of stock (or water if you're out of stock), cook it for literally 20 seconds. The boiling stock (or water) will heat it in no time and it will be nice and moist!  I did this with my leftovers and it allowed the smokiness of the chicken to take center stage. DO IT!!  The bad: nothing!  Good job guys! A well-deserved 4 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Was awesome, pork was perfectly cooked, tasty, loved the wings nice and smoked and the chicken was perfect inside. Great beers on tap , classic !"}
{"text":"This place is a nice walk from our house.  We sat outside, and, although it was a little warm, we cooled down nicely. My husband ordered the salmon platter.  I requested the grilled cheese with smoked vegetables as a side.  The server asked, \"are you sure you don't want meat with that?  We are known for our meat.\"  To which I replied, \"I am known for not liking meat.\"  I guess he was supposed to push the meat.  And also,  he mam'd me to death.  I don't enjoy being called ma'am, but it's everywhere.  Call me babe or hottie instead. The food took a while to arrive.  My husband thought that maybe his food sat for a while.  My vegetables needed salted and peppered, which was an easy fix.  The sandwich was a bit thin on the cheese, but I was so happy to have bread.  I never eat bread, and Texas Toast was a treat. We enjoyed the 80's playlist and had fun trying to guess the artists. It was a nice, ordinary evening."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!!!! Perfect burnt ends and loved the bacon wrapped jalapeños.  We also had BBQ sandwich and brisket tacos, all of which were awesome.  On top of great entrees were amazing sides which separates the best from great."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that Midwood Smokehouse just opened in Birkdale which is very close to where I live. The location gives inviting and relaxing vibes. Plenty of tables and seats, nice looking bar, TVs, fun decors, nice outdoor seating, and clean bathrooms.   Food: BBQ here is one of the best BBQ places I have ever been. We always order the Well-fed combo platter between two of us and it was more than enough food. It comes with 2 sides. Our favorite sides are Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos, BBQ Slaw, and Collard Greens. My mom loves their collard greens so much that she really wants to know their secret recipe. My husband said their brisket is maybe the best he has ever eaten. The brisket was not dry and carried a mild smoke flavored. The brisket had a nice smoked ring on the meat. Tender, smokey and you can get it lean or juicy and more fatty... really incredible.   Service was exceptional. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable.   I can't compliment this place enough! Casual but classy atmosphere with friendly staff and amazing food at great prices."}
{"text":"We'd wanted to try North Carolina style BBQ for a long time since we moved to the area. I knew this place from my co-worker and finally made it on Saturday lunch. It was packed, but we were seated right away since just two of us. First time here I could say that I was impressed with their food and services.  When you walk in, it is very cool and clean atmosphere. Good for family and friends. Staffs were super friendly and attentive. They kept checking on us.   Their menu is on point. You can also find that they have a lot of selection of beer. My fiance ordered the combo platter: the Pig out! You can choose 4 out of 5 kind of meat you want and 2 sides. It came out with a huge portion and good for 2-4 people! They have 2 different BBQ sauces; tomato based and vinegar based. Since we are from Texas, we never liked vinegar based. But at this place, we said yes!!I ordered salmon sammie. It was good but not the best. We loved their bacon wrapped jalapeno! The best we've ever had. Not too much cream cheese it's what we like. For the sides, we loved sweet potato fries and hush puppies. They were just delicious.   There are plenty of parking spots in the back of the restaurant. We'd love to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Ease up on the salt!  Collard green, inedible due to salt.   Ribs, dried out and salty, inedible. Fried Pickles, overly salty and inedible.  Talked to the manager, they knew they were inedible because of a bad batch of pickles but served them anyway. Beans, soaked in fat and overcooked, inedible. Pulled Pork, okay Brisket, okay. Service, very good.  Over all extremely dissatisfied with the food.  Hope to find some real BBQ where I don't have to double up on my blood pressure medicine because of the salt content. Dismayed as to why people recommend this place."}
{"text":"Now I can't believe I haven't left a review here... this place is one of the better smokehouses around there are a lot of things that I've tried here but I went for lunch this past week and tried their, I think it was \"pitmaster's choice\", burger and holy moly it was to die for. Shaved beef brisket with a patty (medium well for me), gouda cheese, some type of Chipotle sauce I can't remember, banana peppers, and a lot more. Right when it was put in front of me you could just smell it and it tasted even better than it smelled. I've also had some of their meats, sausage, ribs, just about all of them and I can't complain about any of them. Hush puppies are amazing, Mac and cheese is amazing, baked beans amazing. Oh and did I mention the BBQ sauces? Those are... amazing!"}
{"text":"Best bbq we've had in North Carolina yet, just what we were hoping for in southern bbq! Everything had that perfect authentic wood-smoked flavor and the sauces weren't even necessary, but took it to the next level of flavor. The brisket was as good as the reviews amped up, moist and smoky more than meaty flavor. Pork and ribs incredible as well. Collards perfectly cooked and not bitter at all. All so worth it, I could go back everyday. Price reasonable for the quantity of food. Service great. Cool mural outside.  Can't recommend enough! All rubs and sauces gf too."}
{"text":"The BEST brisket for sure. I stopped by for dinner on a Sunday night with three of my friends, we opted to share two combo platters. Tried the Carolina Chopped Pork, Beef Brisket, St. Louis Style Pork RIbs, and the Pulled Chicken BBQ. My favorites were the Beef Brisket and Ribs for sure. The brisket was so tender and had great flavor and the ribs were fall off the bone delicious! For the sides we went with Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans, and Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos - all of them were great! Loved the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the collard greens the most. They also have a nice selection of local draft beers. Service was great, a little on the slower side at first, but I think that's because we lagged and took a while to decide on our order. Overall we had a great experience and I would love to come back again if I'm ever in Charlotte."}
{"text":"BBQ for everyone...beginners and experts.  All types of BBQ--chicken, pig, cow, etc and plenty of sauces to complete the whole deal.  I'm not a BBQ expert but I truly feel this place accomplished the goal and it impressed my out of town guests so that is the most important thing!  Like others have stated, the atmosphere is \"down home,\"  the service is friendly, the prices are reasonable, etc.  Between the 7 of us we literally sampled the whole menu...pork bbq, chicken bbq, burnt ends, smoked turkey, ribs, etc.  We also tried the pimento cheese fries for an appetizer and they were nothing short of amazing!!!  The baked beans are a must for your side choice.  They are full of flavor and even have some bbq mixed in.  They are awesome.   Again, I'm not a huge BBQ person so is this the best place Charlotte has to offer?  No clue.  Does it showcase some pretty authentic Caroline BBQ?  I think so!  Good variety, good prices, good side orders, nice sized portions--yes, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I always stumbled a bit when someone would ask me about my favorite place to go for BBQ in town, but I have to say Midwood unexpectedly has given me an answer.  The brisket is amazing (definitely for Charlotte, but even compared to all the Texas brisket I've consumed in my life), the mac n cheese is delish, and you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped jalaps and crispy hushpuppies. The staff steered me away from the pulled pork both times - so I went with the ribs on my second trip - pretty darn good. (I'm trying it next time, though) Lots of side options, but I remember them being a little light on the veg entree options. The Midwood bbq sauce is my current fave, but their mustard sauce is tasty as well. (I still have not come to love carolina vinegarness, so I didn't even try theirs)  Decent beers on tap, lots of whiskey options, and great patio space. The staff is super friendly, though the bartenders may have asked if we were okay a handful too many times. (A little hard to eat if every 30 seconds I have to respond to the question) Pretty speedy service at lunch, looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! Their Cuban sandwich is my favorite. The hostesses are rude and not too friendly but with the amount of traffic they get I let it slide. Make sure you come early because the waiting time for a table it's usually 20 min."}
{"text":"I'm cutting back, way back, on meat but I have to have a little pork every now and then!  The smell of smoke, the good kind, hits you when you open your car door. You know you're in for a treat.   We were seated quickly, especially for prime time Sunday dinner and having a party of seven.   You HAVE to ask for Walter to be your server. He is THE best! And if you close your eyes, you'll swear you're listening to the radio. He has that kind of voice!  The food is amazing. I opted for chopped barbecue with creamed corn and greens. Food arrived super quickly and was hot...and delicious. We love Eastern NC style barbecue and they have \"our\" vinegar-based sauce to top your meat choice.   I wanted dessert but they didn't have wheelchairs. They have something called pecan cobbler that I will have to try on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in the city, love the burnt ends"}
{"text":"Brisket is awesome great atmosphere super friendly staff"}
{"text":"Having never been to Midwood, I was really looking forward to my dinner group meet up. We had reservations and I arrived last, of course. I placed my drink order and received it before the others, who then waited another 20 minutes for theirs to arrive. That should have told us what kind of night it was going to be. After looking over the menu, which I will say is a lot, I decided to go with the small pulled pork plate. Others ordered the Cuban sandwich, ribs and pulled pork as well. My platter came with one side, I chose cole slaw and ordered a side of sweet potato fries.  Service was a little off, but we did receive our dinners and unfortunately I received fries as my side, not cole slaw, plus another plate of fries. Okay, too many fries going on. After catching multiple waitresses I finally received my slaw. And, not really sure it was worth it. The pulled pork was great, the fries were crisp and cooked too perfection, but the slaw...very blah in my mind. Definitely missing something.  Overall the others enjoyed their food, but not sure I would rush back to this location."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is one of the newest additions to the Backlot of the Park Road Shopping Center and that is a yippee for me, as I live in the area.  Having been to other Midwood locations I was definitely looking forward to checking out their newest spot.  The weather was nice so we opted for waiting for a table on the outside patio, which was less than 10 minutes.  While we waited we ordered some drinks at the bar, and eyed every dish that went by, as well as smelled the amazing goodness. After arriving to our table we were greeted by our waitress who was great! She had a smile on her face and definitely gave us and every table around us the attention customers deserve. We decided to order a Combination Platter, which comes with 4 meats and two sides, and added a few additional sides. From the platter selections we chose the Chopped Pork, Brisket, St. Louis Style Pork Ribs and the Hickory Smoked Sausage with Macaroni & Cheese, Smoked Veggies, Crinkle Fries and an extra side of Hushpuppies. The food arrived and boy did it look good. By far the chopped pork and brisket were the winners, with the hushpuppies and fries shining for the sides.   Dinner did not disappoint and overall I think Midwood will be a definite hit in this location. With the service, atmosphere and food as good as it is anyone should check it.  And, go hungry, it's a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place ! Great service and amazing food. Bacon wrapped Jalepeños are crazy good, never had em like this, and fell in love !"}
{"text":"Good BBQ! I tried the salmon with creamed corn and also got a salad. All three of the items were great, and I would highly recommend any of those options. My boyfriend got the rib meal, and it was definitely a hearty portion and looked good. I am looking forward to trying the grilled cheese next time!"}
{"text":"Always my favorite......went last night.....the bartender w dark hair and dark black rimmed glasses ....I think. She was new bc another girl was telling how to do inventory.....was amazing, very attentive but down to business! Always amazing, maybe not perfect but that's real life people! My fav! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Had the burnt ends with Mac n cheese, hush puppies and Texas toast. The small meal was more than enough for 2 meals. The BBQ sauce that's mixed with fat tire has a bit of spiciness to it but not overpowering. I also had the devils cut bourbon with pineapple and ginger soda, for a non bourbon drinker it was pretty good. I want to come back and try the sandwiches and other sides. The area is a bit small but the decor is pretty neat."}
{"text":"Protein plate of brisket, chicken, ribs, burnt ends with greens and cream corn.  All good, favorite would be brisket and ribs.  Good sauces; spices and mustard. No room for desert!"}
{"text":"While visiting some friends in Charlotte, we requested a Southern lunch so they took us to Midwood Smokehouse.  That Southern lunch was definitely delivered!  We sat at a large picnic table outside of the restaurant.  Since we were a larger group, that table was the only area outside that a group of our size could fit.  The other outdoor seating was for 2-4 people.  Midwood Smokehouse has a great local, craft beer list.  We all found something to suit our fancy, from IPA's to wheat beers, and we all enjoyed them thoroughly!  My friend and I decided to share the Combo-Platter, Well-fed.  We had the Carolina Chopped Pork, Beef Brisket, Chopped Chicken BBQ.  Instead of picking a forth meat, we opted for a double order of the brisket.  Our sides were the Mac & Cheese, Smoked Veggies and Hushpuppies.  All of the meat was extremely tender and delicious!  I also thought that the smoke veggies were pretty fabulous!   The mac & cheese and hushpuppies were average, nothing to write home about.  The \"well-fed\" portion was more than enough for the two of us, we weren't able to finish all of it!  Our other friend had the chicken tacos, and said they were delicious (though it is hard to disappoint her with tacos!)  This is a great find, just outside of Uptown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Wow! Being a Texas gal, it really hard to impress me in North Carolina. Let me tell you,  best barbeque I've ever had! Don't pass this place up if you want perfect barbecue!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever with take out and management at Midwood. We placed an order and they gave us someone else's order. We had to drive back and they accused us of taking the wrong order.   Our food was then cold when they handed to us and they said nothing. I asked them if they were going to discount the order. He (Walter) said he would only give us banana pudding.   When he came back with the pudding I asked again would he discount the food. He then asked 'what, do you want free food'. He came back with a gift certificate. Like I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly. You walk in here and instantly feel welcome. Great draft selection. The menu is completely \"on point\" with a great selection of appetizers and main courses. You'll probably be like me and want a little of everything. Guess what? They have a combo platter for that. 2 sizes, as well.   Because I am about to go to a festival, I limited my selection to the bacon wrapped jalapeños (to die for) and the pulled pork sandwich. These were everything great I could expect from a bbq joint. Great music and atmosphere and the food is truly superior to most bbq I've had. Sauces are completely on point.   I'll definitely be back. Time and time again."}
{"text":"Best brisket in Charlotte.  Enough said.  Also, get the jalapeno poppers.  They are amazing!  Baked beans are out of this world too!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ with a bunch of different cuts. Sides are good too.  This is more of a casual dining spot rather than a real authentic, paper plate BBQ place. The inside is really nice the staff is great. In a really neat part of town (Plaza Midwood) so you can walk around to some shops after/before your meal. Combine the food and the environment together and you have a really nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch with a friend. Never been to this location. NOT disappointed. Just a great place and experience. Had a house salad first - lots of veggies and variety for a house salad. Then I got the special for an entree: Hawaiian burger (burger with BBQ and pineapple-infused salsa). HOLY HELL - it was so good. A bit messy but my goodness it was filling and delicious. I can't wait to back. Never a bad meal and service is tops."}
{"text":"My family checked out this place this past weekend and for the most part enjoyed our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, and quickly took our orders.  Just a few notes:  The BBQ Queso was so-so - there was nothing special about a bowl of tortilla chips and a bowl of melted cheese with a clump of BBQ in the middle of it.  I guess I wasn't sure what the expect, but it still seemed very basic.  As for the main meals, my son got a burger and wanted American cheese, but the waiter said they did not have any.  As in, ever.  And yet the menu clearly stated American cheese was used.  Despite this, my son just got a plain hamburger and ate the whole thing, so he had no complaints.  My daughter got Carolina BBQ with a side of baked beans.  She liked the BBQ but not the beans - she didn't really say why.  My husband got burnt ends and loved them, but said the mac & cheese was pretty pedestrian.  I got a sauced half-rack of Memphis ribs with sweet potato fries.  The fries were good, but the ribs were VERY salty.  It was almost as if they brined the ribs before they put them on the fire. They were that salty.  I ended up drinking 3-4 huge cups of water (their cups are about 26-28 fl oz) to compensate.  Would we go here again?  Probably not.  The prices were reasonable, and the space was decent (GREAT music playing over the speakers), but the food wasn't very \"wow\" for us."}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue though I'm from the eastern side of the state so nothing around here seems to compare for me... but for Charlotte it's a pretty strong showing and better than Macs but the atmosphere is t as good so still 4 stars like Macs..."}
{"text":"Yummy! Had the beef brisket. It was amazing. The smoked veggies and the pecan cobbler were also delish. Service was good and the prices were reasonable. Only in Charlotte for a couple of days but we will likely reyurn to try some other things."}
{"text":"The central location has always been good so decided to try this one.  Smoked salmon is usually good at smoke houses...  just ok, nothing special.  Stuffed bacon wrapped jalapeños - 2 out of 3 not stuffed.  Told by server that side salad could be substituted for a side.  Was unexpectedly up charged.  Also side salad had corn and black beans tossed into salad, no option to remove because of staff tossing salad for you..  top it off with having told the server that I didn't care for the salad and receiving an \"oh\".  Later questioned up charge and received a \"would you like a refill to go?\"  It was as if I hadn't said anything.  Only refill given was the one to go...   at central location managers come by to ask how your meal was, the two men who appeared to be managers stood over by bar talking.  May have ruined my support for Millwood in future..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ spot in Charlotte. Ive been to both locations and both be swinging. I always order their smoked wings and their platter which comes with your choice of meat and sides. Their beer selection is good too as I always rock out with a apple beer."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The one time something came out improper (lean instead of fatty brisket) they took care of it within minutes. Great beer and drink selection for a food focused restaurant."}
{"text":"Succulent Southern goodness!!  I came here with some friends on Saturday. After scouring Yelp, driving around town, and ruling out some places that have been featured on various TV shows (but had terrible ratings), we agreed on this place.   We decided to sample a little of everything: The fried pickles were pretty good, if you're into that sort of thing. (I heard that they're a Southern thing, so I decided to give them a try.) The pimento cheese fries were cheesy and yummy and otherwise delicious! The hushpuppies... well, I could eat those by the pound. Fried just right, not at all greasy. Just a little bit sweet and perfect one-bite sized. Careful though; you can eat a whole order without realizing it (and then you would have no room for BBQ, and nobody wants that!)  I got the brisket \"burnt ends\" for my entrée. To be 'ends', they were surprisingly tender with just the right amount of sweet, smoky sauce. The mac and cheese was the real deal, with the slightly charred cheese on top... just like mama used to make (none of that Easy Mac crap that some of these places try to give you)! The creamed corn was not too sweet, a little peppery... not what I expected, but not bad. My friends got a half slab of ribs and smoked salmon respectively and the only complaint at the table was that there was more food on the table than belly to put it all in.  Stuffed though we were, we HAD to make room for dessert. Our server (Drew?) talked us into some of their homemade banana pudding. After interrogating him thoroughly about the legitimacy of the pudding (Is it banana \"flavored\" instant pudding? Are there real Nilla wafers in it? Are there any actual bananas in the pudding?), we were informed that it is made fresh by a baker that the restaurant 'stole' from a local bakery nearby.  (And in case you're wondering...No, it's not instant pudding. Yes, there are lots of Nilla wafers inside [and no, they are not soggy! That's a pet peeve of mine], as well as fresh, not browned, bananas).  The pudding was a bit too sweet for my taste (to be fair, I'm VERY picky 'bout my pudding!), but my friends gobbled it right on up.  The cocktails were ok. My friend got a drink with smoked ice (yes, smoked ice) in it that she thoroughly enjoyed. I got something with Jim Beam Devil's Cut, but to be fair, the drinks were in waaaay over their head competing with all the succulent flavors coming from the numerous plates surrounding them. All in all, we had a blast! The service was as good as the food and if I'm ever in Charlotte again, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love Midwood Smokehouse on Central, this place is not like the Central Ave location. Food good, service good, just not the same feel. Almost felt like a chain restaurant like the Sticky Fingers before it. Would have been four stars if I felt at home, just didn't."}
{"text":"My wife took me on my birthday for dinner. Much better than our last visit. Great service, food is always great. Had fatty brisket and my wife had tacos. Food never disappoints. We always ask to sit in booths near door, best seats in the house."}
{"text":"I know the entire world LOVES this place. I promise you this is not a \"bangwagon\" review. I personally find myself not easily impressed by any of the \"OMG it's the best blah blah blah\" places people typically raved about.   Honestly I have no beef with Midwood Smokehouse, and I frequent enough to be \"a fan.\" I should disclose the fact that I'm not a big BBQ person, thus this rarely is my 1st choice to dine at. With that being said, I suppose their foods are consistent and reasonably priced. I have my fav item here, which is their (not so) small salad with smoked salmon added. It's the most food you can get for $8, and semi healthy. Their Avocado Green Goddess is my dressing choice.   I do have to say service is hit & miss. Brian was great this last time, which was a welcomed change. One time we sat at the bar, and the bartender refused my request to leave my salmon whole (I am not a cat, I don't like shredded fish). I thought that was rude and un-restaurant of them to refuse my otherwise reasonable request. PLUS parking is a pain, especially with all the new housing built nearby.   If I can offer half star, this would be a solid 3.5-star place in my world. It's hump day, and I'll be nice and throw in the other half and made it a 4-star review."}
{"text":"This place has great BBQ and atmosphere. The staff is friendly and fast. I've also been to the Central Ave location several times and was pleased when they opened a closer location. It can get very busy but that is because they have great food!"}
{"text":"Great ribs! I snuck in an hour before they closed and was warned that they were out of some things and almost out of the pork ribs. I wanted to try the ribs as they are my litmus test for bbq joints. I got one of the last half racks and they were superb, despite being one of the last ones. They surely sat in a warmer for a long time and were still moist and tender and very good. The spicy chipotle sauce was delicious and the collards were great too. Thumbs up for this place, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all the terrific reviews.  I have been twice and both times by meat was dry and we had less than \"great\" service.  I might try one more time, but after that, I'm heading back to Mac's for always great sandwiches and the best smoked chicken wings in town!"}
{"text":"Overrated!  Had a burger.....Sounded delicious on menu but it was lousy.....Chewy!!!!!    Gross......I managed to eat about a third and left there hungry.   Fries were mediocre at best....What a disappointment this place was!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On the night that I went,they were very busy. They asked me if I wanted to carry out or dine in. I told them take out because she said that the wait time would be 30 mins. For dining in. The wait was worth it!!! I had a brisket plate the sauce was married to the meat and it was very tender and savory!!!! The customer service was awesome as well!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here on Sunday and we both were extremely pleased! First, our server, Matt, was exceptional! He was without a doubt the most informative server that I have ever come across in my nearly 50 years of dining out. Matt explained to us about the smoker, the whiskey, the brisket, the different sauces, just everything! He was awesome! He even brought us out a sample of brisket and the sauces to try out to help us decide on what to order. The brisket was phenomenal and my husband went with ordering the fatty style brisket and added on the burnt ends. He shared, of course, and OMG! Heaven in your mouth! Best brisket I have ever eaten! Definitely order the fatty brisket as it will literally melt in your mouth! I ordered a rack of ribs and they were the best ribs that I have had since moving to NC three years ago, and we have tried many, many ribs down here! I shared as well and STILL brought home enough for us to have lunch the next day! The ribs were soooo good that you do not even need any sauce but I did still dip a few in because their sauces are delish too! I couldn't decide which sauce I liked better so Matt brought me all 4 on the side! How cool is that!!! For dessert we split a banana pudding and it was fantastic! The texture was more like a fluffy mousse and it was so creamy and yummy! Just thinking about it is making my mouth water! This please was off the hook fantastic and we will definitely make this our go-to barbecue place!"}
{"text":"Immediate seating outside and a short wait for indoors.  Burnt ends were great and small portion is perfect size. Suggest to add a sausage for a few bucks more."}
{"text":"Always fabulous.   Best burnt ends. Best staff  always friendly and wonderful.        Can not recommend them enough"}
{"text":"Great BBQ (pork and chicken) friendly staff, great service. Get there early if you want a table, they stay packed during lunch!!!"}
{"text":"This Kansas city native and recent Austin Texas transplant has high hopes when it comes to BBQ.....and man, Midwood delivered! Best brisket I've ever had. Great beer selection. Good collard greens. My fiancé got the ribs and said they were great.  I got the grilled cheese sandwich and added pulled pork on it and was loving every bite. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The staff at the bar today acted as if it was a burden to serve anyone.  It made me feel bad about being here.  I had a to go order and I ordered two glasses of wine, two meal and cheese dip.  I started eating my cheese dip at the bar while I waited to finish my wine.  Some of the chips were stale.  I advised the bartender, she said they are made fresh to order and walked off.  WHAT?  That maybe the case but some of the ones in my box are stale.  Just RUDE! I felt like me or my business was not wanted.  That is a bad feeling."}
{"text":"Great service and pretty good BBQ."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Texas bbq, but when you're in North Carolina, you have to try a local favorite, especially when a local friend insists on you going there.   Midwood is different from a lot of the local Texas options.  For one thing, Midwood offers table service and serves their meat on a plate instead of butcher paper.    But the important thing is the food.  The brisket is excellent and would compete well in Texas.  The sauce is tasty and they offer a variety of sauces.  I also liked my fries and hush puppies.  If I had one gripe at all, it would be that the St. Louis style ribs would've benefited from a bit more time in the smoker.   On a final note, our service was excellent and truly embodied southern hospitality.    If you're going to eat bbq outside of Texas, Midwood is the place to eat it.  And I am now a convert to the cause of serving hush puppies with bbq."}
{"text":"Disappointed! I love Midwood and usually eat the location on Central Ave. which has never EVER disappointed me in my 6 years of living in charlotte and eating there. Went to the Ballantyne location and my Mac and Cheese was dry, my pull pork sandwich barely had any meat on it, the burnt ends were not as tasty! I give it 2 stars only because the baked beans were great! The Ballantyne location is nice and pleasant however if you want EXCELLENT food the real Midwood way go to the location on Central for the real smoked, southern, good taste of food! Ughh! So upset!"}
{"text":"The best Midwood in Charlotte ! Always good food and great service even when you have a wait !!! Had a bad experience at the Ballantyne location but didn't stop me from going to my fav central location !!!!"}
{"text":"WOW, WOW and WOW.  This is serious BBQ and one of my favorite places in the last couple of years.  First, to roll in at 930p and still find the food appearing and tasting as fresh as when it likely opened was a welcome surprise.  I got a platter with chopped pork, chopped chicken, ribs and brisket.  The serving was the smaller platter but it was all I could manage.  The meat was perfectly smoked with intense smoke, but not too much.  Moist, delicious and even better when dipped in the three sauces brought with the platter.  Pickled onions and hushpuppies along with the bbq slaw and bacon wrapped jalepenos rounded out my dinner.  Pretty reasonable price for a great meal in a nice, upscale environment."}
{"text":"Midwood is still the go to place for bringing your out-of-town guests to show them the great Queen City barbecue. And so I met my Minneapolis buddy here! Great service from our waitress, who kept the conversation going and kept the beers filled.  We split a plate of the pimento cheese fries. Plenty here for three, but we put a good dent in it. Lots of great cheese, good grilling that toasted the fries and melted the cheese all the way down.  For barbecue, my friend had the four meat sampler and enjoyed it. He said that the sausage was particularly tasty. I had the pulled pork, with mac & cheese. It did not need any extra sauce. The pork was chopped fine, which made it a little mushy. Next time, I'll go for the sliced brisket perhaps.  Overall, still great to visit and still great to bring your visitors."}
{"text":"I got well fed which consisted of 4 proteins and 2 sides. I chose the ribs, chopped pork, chopped chicken, and pork burnt ends. The ribs were pretty good. They could have been more tender but not bad. The chopped pork and chopped chicken were awesome. The pork burnt ends were really good... For my 2 sides I chose the collard greens and bacon wrapped jalapeños.. The collard greens were ok. The jalapeños were good. My server Parker was amazing! He was on top of everything even though he had a larger party and other tables."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about this joint and managed to make it out for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  I arrived just a little after noon and was able to park in the lot directly in front of the restaurant.  While there were a bunch of open tables outside, there was only two tables open inside.  I was able to snag an inside table (it's much easier reading a newspaper at a table as opposed to the bar) and began perusing the menu.  Jennifer came out to take my drink order and when she returned, I peppered her with questions about the menu.  Among other things, I discovered that there is more meat on the small plate, than there is on the sandwich.  I decided to go with the small plate with mac and cheese and the creamed corn as the sides.   Food was out in less than ten minutes.  The pork was wonderfully smokey and came with a small side of sauce (eastern-style).  On appearance, the hushpuppies looked more like tater tots.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but.....it gave the impression that they were pre-fab.  They were almost too perfect.  And I have to admit that I wasn't a big fan of the mac and cheese.  It was not creamy enough for my liking.  With all that said, the creamed corn was outta sight!  There was a strong black pepper taste which I loved.  Service was fantastic.  When Jennifer found out that I didn't like the mac and cheese, she offered something else.  She was apologetic and returned within a minute with a side of the red slaw (which was terrific, by the way).  She was quick to refill my beverage and was very helpful answering my questions.  As has been mentioned earler, the cost is a little on the high side, but it was a lot of food, and I think it's worth it.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I will forever love this place for what they did for me and my family.  I had probably about 40-50 people with me celebrating and Midwood got on the job and found sitting for us in 30min probably less, the manager was  serving us.  That happened last year 4/8/2016 and my family still till this day, no lie, not even joking like 4-5 people mentioned it again today,   awesome sauce, get the burnt ends!     Thanks,  C."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Went twice, first time I had the brisket, second time burnt ends. Made sure to order a large portion, so I could have some for lunch the day after as well. Definitely a place to go if you're visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned this is the best bbq in Charlotte. The service is great and the food is impeccable!! They also have a great beer selection. Whenever we have friends in town this is one of our go to places."}
{"text":"Always delicious, always great service. Love the hushpuppies. Be sure to try the chopped salad and green goddess dressing. Yummm"}
{"text":"The pulled pork grilled cheese is flat out AMAZING. The wings are also very VERY good. I cannot talk about anything else because I cannot NOT order these every time I go. lol. They have small crinkle cut french fries which is a surprising treat.  Parking isn't the great"}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse has by far the best BBQ in Charlotte. My favorite is the small Carolina Pork Plate with a side of creamed corn. I will say that the cream corn recipe has changed recently and I don't like it as much as the old one. The old one had a really good pepper flavor and the new recipe is a little bland.   I went for a friend's birthday recently - we had a large group and some mild issues getting seated. The hostess seemed a little agitated when she took us outside to sit in the enclosed patio and we asked to be moved inside (I used to be a hostess and would have asked the party if they were okay with going outside before taking them out there and then turning around... but anyway).  Our server was really upbeat and attentive to our needs. He was great! I look forward to going back to Midwood."}
{"text":"Good but not e best. Ribs were my favorite even though everyone said to get the brisket. Service is excellent and supper friendly.  By all means go here, but not in my atop 3 list."}
{"text":"Love their smoked wings and brisket. Parking can be tricky during peak hours."}
{"text":"I know they JUST opened like yesterday, and I know they just literally got their liquor license today before they opened, but this was a meh experience. I ordered a Moscow Mule and there's no way there was any alcohol in it. I watched the bartender search for a pour spout, not find one, leave the unopened bottle at the end of the bar, pull down two more brand new unopened bottles of vodka and just leave them. I didn't watch the actual preparation of my drink but I definitely didn't taste the alcohol and all three bottles of vodka remained unopened, without pour spouts, and were clearly full bottles. I was also half way done with my entree before the second half of my companion's meal appeared. Guess the kitchen forgot? Pros though are that it's spacious and has a good layout, my food and half of my companion's appeared quickly, food was good, and their SC mustard sauce is pretty good, coming from a SC girl. I realize new openings and probably new staff come with hiccups, and this is right by me so of course I'll be back, next time I'll say something about my $9 cocktail though."}
{"text":"I love this place, I can't get brisket anywhere else and be happy.  The wings are amazing as well, and the cheese fries --- oh lawd!  Love Love Love"}
{"text":"I'm an official regular, someone help me I'm addicted to Midwood Smokehouse.   I'm a HUGE Fan of the brisket . I love the option of  a lean plate, fatty, or both. (Both is great!)  Give me some bacon wrapped jalapenos as a side and I'm good to go! Or try the greens that will make you wanna slap yo momma.  Look for your drink and food specials when you walk in, written on the large glass mirror behind the bar. They have mug nights here where you can bring in a 40oz and get it filled for $4-6!  Great service as always, fast, friendly and knowledgeable. I look forward to coming back very very very soon!"}
{"text":"Generous portions and flavorful well cooked meats. I had the chicken barbeque sandwich and it was overflowing! The slaws were nice as well and the sauces were delicious."}
{"text":"delicious but a bit pricy for bbq...im sure thats only because they have to keep up with the plaza midwood rent... great drinks great food great atmosphere! nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"If I don't count the food truck I visited one day for lunch, then this is probably the best BBQ I had in a week of being in South Carolina (plus this one evening in Charlotte). I am sustained by eastern North Carolina BBQ (it's at the bottom of my personal Maslow's hierarchy, just below wifi)  so I had to try even though I know this isn't that part of the country.  We started with pimento cheese fries, because, well, pimento cheese fries. These were broiled before being served, and they were totally delicious. Zero complaints here - nice browned cheese (and plenty of it) and nice crisp fries. Good stuff.  Then we split the burnt ends and the chopped pork. Burnt ends were almost like...ham cubes, I've never had burnt ends in this kind of a regular shape. But they were in a good sauce, even if my normal preference isn't sweet BBQ sauce, and they were tender and tasty. So I'm not going to complain about those. And the chopped pork was decent - reasonable amount of smoke if not a bit dry, but I fixed the dry problem with their vinegar sauce, which I liked. For sides, we went with collards and cole slaw, both of which were fine. Greens were trending a bit sweet, but that's OK, without a ton of garlic. Slaw was fairly basic, nothing really to write home about.  So, tons of good reviews here, I feel like I am bucking the trend. It's not bad, it's just not exceptional. Our service was good, the price was totally reasonable, and the food was fine...I just have to believe there are better options. Alas, it was a Sunday night and several of the more hole in the wall places with photos of food that made my mouth water were closed."}
{"text":"Just had the Q at the Midwood. Outstanding. As it was my first time I went with the combo platter to sample various meats. Ribs, pork, brisket, and sausage were my choices. All were terrific. Sauces were good but nothing special. The pickled onions were unusual but the perfect change up between the meats. Mac and cheese was exceptional.  I'm stuffed.   I went early, 5:00 PM on a Saturday after reading how packed it gets. Glad I did.  By the time I left a hour and change later it was jammed.   Sat at the bar and had terrific service from Chad the bartender. Thanks Chad.   Bottom line:  I'll be back.  As often as I can."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here a while back, ordered a large BBQ chicken plate for $12 with mac and cheese and BBQ baked beans as out 2 sides. Ordering was easy, we actually ordered about 30 minutes before closing but whoever answered the phone was extremely understanding and polite. He said the plate would take about 20 minutes to make. We ended up picking up our food 10 minutes after close, they were still very pleasant about it. We brought our boxes home to find a crazy amount of BBQ chicken, score! It was delicious too, the South Carolina Mustard sauce it is tossed it is delish! There was so much, that we used the left overs to make BBQ chicken sandwiches the next day. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac and cheese, it was kinda dry, but I blame myself for ordering so late. I assume it was the last batch of the day. Will have to try it fresh, I'm sure it won't disappoint. The hush puppies were also good as well, love the jalapeno addition, I wish we were given more lol. The large BBQ chicken plate really was a large, the two of us couldn't even finish it in one sitting.   Although, they really need to make it clear that there is red meat in the bbq beans. I was a little disappointed I couldn't eat them. But, we will be back for a sit down because the rest of the food was soo damn good! The salmon entree sounds soooo good. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot in Charlotte. Constantly in here for dinner or take/out. I am a big fan of their chicken and beef, never been crazy about their pork. Highly recommend the Dixie Chicken Salad with the chipotle ranch and also the Burnt ends with BBQ baked beans and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW.  We travel a lot and we are huge fans of BBQ.  We frequently visit our local BBQ place in New York and I think we found one that takes the mark.  This place is a wonderful local place with excellent food and great service.  We went on a Sunday during church hours so we had no wait (go before 1pm for lunch).    I ordered the brisket plate which came with your choice of lean, fat, or both types of brisket.  Me being the meat lover, I went for both types.  The dish also included typical southern sides, and hush puppies.  The atmosphere was wonderful and the kitchen was pumping the smell into the dining room making you hungrier.  When the food came, I could not wait to sink my teeth into it.  The fat on the brisket melted in your mouth.  I used the back end of the knife and fell apart so beautifully.  Very attentive staff and wonderful food and prices definitely puts this place on the top of our list.  Only one caveat (they had no control over) was that parking was EXTREMLY limited.  They share a 30 car parking lot with 2 other businesses.  They also had street parking which was hard to find."}
{"text":"recommended by a true bbq lover, we stopped in for dinner recently on a tuesday night. they were so nice, offered us a tour of their smoker when we finished dining, clearly realizing that we werent from the area. we came and had the brisket, burnt ends, sausage, ribs, chicken, avocado salad - and were not disappointed. they were so hospitable the entire time, checking in on us occassioally. we opted to dine out right by the entrance since it was a really nice evening. started to regret it as the meal ended as we all started to feel like we were being attacked by mosquitoes, although we didnt actually see any. definitely glad we chose to come here versus the bbq near our hotel."}
{"text":"First dinner in Charlotte, NC and boy was it filling! Ordered the small burnt ends and the large beef brisket. Loved the burnt ends a bit more... please see my amazing photos ;)  Dessert: banana pudding (5/5)  The photo composition though."}
{"text":"Yummy bbq with yummy sides. Straight forward and simple. They have been so successful they expanded not long after opening, doubling the size of their space. Wait staff is good about checking the table and I've never had any real issues with my food, it never takes long! My whole family enjoys midwood!"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly but the food was just at par. I won't rush back to this place but it was a good bbq fix with all the different styles of sauce at the ready. The beer list is overwhelming but the staff is really knowledgeable about the full list. My boyfriend and I split the sharing size of the pick 4 meats and 2 sides (bacon wrapped jalapenos were delicious) and we're both big eaters and we had leftovers, the portion size was huge. Ribs were great, chopped pork was also pretty good but the brisket and sausage could use a bit of work. Worth another try when we're really craving BBQ."}
{"text":"Gotta say, Midwood Smokehouse was pretty tasty--coming from a girl raised on Memphis style BBQ.  Everything was delicious.  I had the pulled pork plate, an utterly huge portion for a reasonable price (choice of meat, two sides, and hush puppies). The fries were lightly spicy and cut very thin, fried to a perfect crisp.  I enjoyed my one hush puppy.  It had a slight kick and was nice and crunchy with a rich cornmeal flavor.  The best part was definitely the Mac and cheese.  The noodles were soft and cooked perfectly and the cheese struck the perfect balance between gooey parts and semi-solid parts.  The BBQ itself almost paled in comparison to the sides, but it was quite good with a nice smoky flavor.  I will say that I preferred the more southern style sweet sauce than the vinegar based sauce, and I wish the pork had been a little more moist without having to add sauce.  The only disappointment at Midwood was the banana pudding, which I felt had too much whipped cream and not enough bananas, vanilla wafers, or, well, pudding.   The decor is super cute--we now sometimes play trivia at home with the name \"Praise the Lard\"--and the service was good.  Midwood is worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ you can find in Charlotte. I always get the Beef Brisket, the small plate, with sweet potato fries and almost am never able to finish it with all the food. The jalapeño bacon appetizer is incredible and is also a must try. The restaurant also has a great selection of craft beers on tap from the area.  Atmosphere is great and not too loud for large groups. If it's nice out, try and find a spot on their outside patio."}
{"text":"The best bbq in Charlotte! The platters and stock yard tacos are my favorite! It gets pretty crowded so come early. The service is  pretty good, every time I've been there I've seen the manager walk around and ask people how the service was."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite BBQ place in the world.  Their ribs are amazing and you must order the Burnt Ends. One of the last places that actually smoke their own meats on premise.   And the chicken and smoked sausage is among my favorites too!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. Service was fast and food was delicious. I had the pork burnt ends and my husband had a philly cheese sandwich that he loved. Craft beer was yummy as well."}
{"text":"This location used to be a Smoke Modern BBQ, but has now reopened to be Midwood.   I never noticed how dark and dreary Smoke used to be. When we walked in to try out Midwood, our first thoughts were\"wow it's so bright and spacious in here!\"   The service was just wonderful. Our waitress was so friendly and explained the new features of this place compared to before. A man (manager?) came by and asked if we were enjoying everything.   The meat was fresh, smoky, but clean, and flavorful. The sauces were delicious, and so were the sides.  I'm not a huge bbq fan, nor do I ever crave it, but if it happens, I'll be sure to come back here!"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 items on the menu tonight.  The Midwood Chopped salad was as you'd expect.  Nice mixture of veggies.... All good.  We also got the Hogapeño dip which was surprisingly not hot at all... But good.  Loved the pickled veggies!  They had some kick.  Our favorite were two tacos... The brisket and chicken.  Both very flavorful and unique.  Cameron was our rockstar server.... Great, great guy.  We finished up with the cookie pie.  YUM!!  Great place.  Service was awesome.  Food was delicious and reasonable.  Loved Midwood BBQ."}
{"text":"A. was my waitress, she was menu-intellegent, friendly, responsive, and customer conscious. I had the small tossed salad (big and yummy) BBQ Chicken with smoked veggies (very yummy). I will definitely be back next visit, and would recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago. After moving back South, I've been looking for a good BBQ spot and was not disappointed. I had the Carolina Pork BBQ plate with bacon wrapped jalapeños and mac & cheese. Everything was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"So last night I volunteered for the CF Foundation at the Brewer's Ball and was fortunate enough to meet some of the staff from Midwood Steakhouse  and indulge in delectable tastings.   The brisket was butter -- and that was the word floating about all night at the Brewer's Ball. So finally when I took a break I b-lined it over to their table.   The brisket was amazing, falling off your fork amazing.  The juices ran clear and the outside was perfectly seasoned. They also paired the brisket with a sweet vinegar and sweet onion mixture - wow that was truly amazing as well. Being on a carb free diet I left the bun behind and opted for a beer -- my carb cheat!   I'm truly excited to get my family into this establishment so that I can try their other offerings. And hopefully to see the staff again!   Hey Amy -- it was a pleasure meeting you last night!"}
{"text":"I feel bad having to give Midwood a 1 Star, but they definitely earned it for my dinner on Friday. They're doing a baby back ribs special and it was horrendous. The meat smelled foul and was gray (over cooked?)... it tasted like it may have been microwaved at one point, but I'm not sure. I have no idea what would explain the smell and taste of the meat, but I just know it was gross. I tried two ribs (I hoped the first was a fluke, but it wasn't) and ate the side of cornbread.   Service was great, but hard to make up for the gross meat. Our waitress asked if we wanted to box it up, and was probably confused as to why the plate was relatively full.   I will say that my wife did enjoy her dinner, but was likewise grossed out by mine.  It'll be a while until we go back... at least until this special is over."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Burnt ends and BBQ baked beans will absolutely set you free. Only giving 4 stars because some of the meat was a little dry. But overall, this is some DELICIOUS food. I'm here on business, and will absolutely come here again the next time in town. Keisha was my server, and she was the bomb! So friendly and helpful.  Go here y'all!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had the pimento fries with beef brisket and jalapeños with bacon n cheese as appetizers.  Everything was perfect and flavorful.  Had the combo with mac n cheese and greens.  Taste homemade as if grandma was in the kitchen cooking it herself.  Manager was very personable and meeting guests.  Waitress was as sweet as pie, answered all our questions and very patient as we were first time guests.  Great recommendations.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Had the Carolina Pork with a side of the smoked sausage and Mac n cheese. It was amazing! Tender and oh so flavorful! Had the hot BBQ Sauce on Iran's had the perfect balance of heat and bbq sweetness. Highly highly recommend, a must if your in Carolina!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place. When.you walk in the smell is heavenly. The brisket is good try the moist or the burnt ends. The sides collards and Mac n cheese very good. Hush puppies were great! The beer tap was not working out of CO2  that night.  But they carry several local beers to chose from. Good food overall."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ spots in Charlotte that I've found so far! The wings are out of this world, they don't even need sauce. We tried almost everything--the wings, half chicken, ribs, and burnt ends. The burnt ends were my favorite, I definitely recommend. Everything was cooked perfectly.  The hushpuppies are a great addition to every plate, and for sides we loved the creamed corn and mac and cheese.   Huge drink selection from the bar--and sitting at the bar to eat is a great option when it's super busy."}
{"text":"Just WOW!!!!  Lots of flavors. Great Que, Brew, and Bourbon. Service was excellent too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I am from the North, so I never really had good BBQ until moving down to NC. I tried a few BBQ places down here and they were all great, but somehow Midwood Smokehouse managed to separate itself.  Here is why: Fatty Brisket.....It sounds odd (or maybe it doesn't if you are from the South), but it was awesome.  It melted in your mouth. Everything else was good, but this was the All-Star.  Service was great, too.  Only downside is that the restaurant is a little bit cramped, so it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Great brisket.  If you're a transplant you're probably like the pork, but if you're a Carolina boy like me, drive to Lexington."}
{"text":"There is probably nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about Midwood Smokehouse. Either I've been out of Texas too long, or this truly is good southern BBQ! Brisket, burnt ends, BBQ queso, bacon wrapped jalapeños, pimento cheese - everything I've tried is fantastic! Be prepared to wait because this place is always crowded."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money in this friendly BBQ joint. It was packed out for our weekday lunch, which is always a good sign. The food took a while to come out but with orders for eight people that's totally forgivable.  The pulled chicken had decent texture but not a great deal of smoke flavor to it - the SC-style mustard sauce had a real acidic hit to it that worked nicely with the meat. BBQ beans were on the sweet side but well-made and packed with flavor. Hush puppies and pickled onions on the side were fine. $8 for this.  I will happily go back and sample more of their meats and sauce styles - they also have 'traditional' BBQ sauce, East NC vinegar-based sauce, and some habanero effort.  This place came highly recommended by locals and I can understand why. Very impressive at a low price point."}
{"text":"Never had even a mediocre item here.  Everything is amazing, I order far too much because it is even better heated up the next day.  Fall off the bone ribs, great brisket, tons of excellent sides. Lovely.   The expansion makes it a lot easier to get in though doesn't have as much charm as the original section. Could use a few more taps but I am nit-picking.  I eat here just about every other week and take every out of town visitor here and they love it."}
{"text":"Just open, truly spectacular barbecue, I can't wait to come back, try on Thursday night that is half-price bottles of wine yahoo!"}
{"text":"Sitting outside. With our dog eating a \"pig out\" platter. Life can't get any better! Excellent BBQ! Bacon wrapped jalapeños are phenomenal! Sweet potato fries crisped to perfection. Brisket melting in mouth..."}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever had. Friendliest waitress I've ever had. My group received free brisket queso because they accidentally made too much or the wrong thing for another customer and they handed it to us the second we sat down. There was some forgetfulness from the waitress, but she was so bloody thoughtful and nice that a simple reminder was enough to get the beer and sauce we ordered. One of the best meals I've had."}
{"text":"This place is okay. As two people that grew up in the Texas Panhandle, my husband and I definitely know our barbecue.  I started off with a Bloody Mary, which was actually one of the best ones I've had! Like a classy lady, I licked off the entire glass's rim which was dipped in a delicious BBQ rub. We also shared the queso with pork - which was very good but we quickly ran out of chips. I'm a total brat when it comes to queso and chips when they don't give you enough chips to finish the appetizer.  The waitress was MIA for quite awhile, so we still had 3/4 left without chips and it went cold. That's a big no no in Texas.   I got the Carolina pork and Mac n cheese - which I would give 4 stars. It wasn't the best I had, but it was very good. My husband got the fatty brisket, which seemed \"wet\" versus moist - we both were NOT impressed. His potato fries weren't great either."}
{"text":"The salads, brisket, sides, and cue are outstanding! Two out of three rib orders very dry. Recommend other menu items instead of the ribs."}
{"text":"My husband and his work peeps always went to downtown Charlotte..well, now that I've shown them Midwood Smokehouse...they won't be going downtown for a while! Love the atmosphere, decor and ambiance of the place; the owner came by to check on us. Entire staff was so friendly! Every bite we had was great, thanks Yelpers! The waitress improvised a \"little bit of everything\" platter for the 3 of us, and I have to say I loved the mac n chz, coleslaw and all of the meats. The brisket was a bit more fatty than I am used to here in Texas, but the flavor was wonderful. I am not a sausage person, but those bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with \"conglomerate meat\", as I call it..were very good! Fried pickles hot and crispy; perfect partner for a drink! The men had beer, but I had a special \"Tea\" they made (its on the drink menu), and loved it.  We will Definitely be back to Midwood Smokehouse and enjoyed sitting outdoors.  This entire neighborhood is full of cool bars and places to eat.!"}
{"text":"Cute, friendly atmosphere with AWESOME food. I had the Carolina BBQ chicken sand which with the stuffed jalapenos wrapped in bacon. Can't go wrong! I will go back and utilize the patio and corn hole games next time!"}
{"text":"I'm not a carnivore who likes to eat in mass quantities btw but this place isn't half bad. I ordered the sausage plate and picked from my man's beef brisket -- good stuff. We finished the plate with no problems. The small plate was perfect . . . scared to see what the large is. The collard greens were not bad either. The little tater tott things were tastey."}
{"text":"Pretty decent barbeque!  I had a great pear cider with my meal.  My husband and kids started with the bacon wrapped jalepano peppers and they were gone pretty quickly so I am guessing they were pretty good.  We got a combo platter to split at our table so we could try a little of everything.  The brisket was awesome and the pork was pretty decent too.  The pulled chicken tasted a little dry and I didn't really love the ribs...but am not generally a fan of Saint Louis style ribs.  The sides we got (fries and creamed corn) were good too.  We shared a peach cobbler to end the meal with which was okay.  Service was great.  They have outdoor seating as well...if only I could get my hisband to enjoy sitting outside as well...that would be perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte to get BBQ.  Love the hush puppies.  Because it's so popular, there is usually a wait, and parking is a beast.  However, those are minor issues for the awesome food!"}
{"text":"Just visited this gem last night with my family and there's a 150% chance that we'll be back! My mom heard about Midwood on one of those cooking shows that she watches so she wanted to check it out. Needless to say, 2 years passed and we still hadn't even looked the place up yet. We finally committed to coming yesterday and were met with the most unimaginable aroma of woodchips and spices- we were outside waiting and I just couldn't wait to get my hand on some of this food!  We had the smoked wings for an appetizer and I have to say that those were the best wings I've had in Charlotte. We ordered our sauces on the side and I'm not very sure what all of them were but my favorite was the habanero. I had the Carolina pork plate with smoked vegetables and I honestly kicked myself for not ordering the large plate. The pork was so moist and seasoned to freaking perfection. The pickled onions paired with the meat perfectly and the hush puppies were fresh.  My mom ordered the rib special that's going on this week and she said that she wished she had ordered the whole rack instead of half! My father had the brisket and had no complaints (which is a VERY good thing).  My husband had the Cuban and he said it was really good. It was his first time having a Cuban so he didn't really have anything to gauge it on but it was really good from what I tasted. It's pretty safe to say that from a first experience this tasty, Midwood is definitely going to become a family staple for us."}
{"text":"I would say over all our lunch experience was just was okay.  Midwood Smokehouse smells great, but you leave smelling like smoked meat all day.  Service was outstanding--and that is a big plus for us.   The food was pretty good/okay, certainly not what I expected.  I had the  BBQ sandwich, it was nothing special.  you can certainly find better BBQ in Charlotte -- no matter your \"style\" preference.   As a side, I had the bacon wrapped jalapenos,  definitely the highlight of my Midwood Smokehouse experience.  My husband had the fried bologna sandwich with the smoked veggies.  The smoked veggies had no taste of veggies and only tasted of smoke.  He was not a fan of his sandwich, because the cheese overtook the bologna.    The Midwood Smokehouse has fixed alot of the problems the former tenant had in regards to usage of space. The bar is no longer awkward and the set up is very spacious.   I would go back, but will wait a while for them to come into their own.  Maybe with a little time this place can be another great eatery in Plaza-Midwood."}
{"text":"Great food, had the pulled pork and \"the Texas special\". My 6 year old daughter loved both, as did my wife and I. Service needs a little work."}
{"text":"Jeanette was an awesome waitress. So attentive and you could tell she was a hard worker! On top of that, you could tell the team that worked Friday night on 3/23 worked well together and helped each other out. As someone that has worked in the food service industry for a while, this speaks a lot about how well a restaurant is functioning. The food was good and the portions were excellent- but the service is what made our visit outstanding."}
{"text":"A while back my wife went to Kansas City to visit relatives, and while she was out of town, I decided to try the Midwood Smokehouse for dinner, based on what I've seen in reviews.  This was the new location behind the Park Road Shopping Center.  I'm a big fan of burnt ends, and when I'm in Kansas City I always get them from one of the many excellent BBQ joints in Missouri.  As I've eaten so much BBQ pork over the years brisket is nice change of pace. (BTW the best chopped pork is at Wilbur's in Goldsboro).  The brisket had so much salt it was almost inedible.  I'd take a bite then drink some water.  After every bite I would have to drink some water.  The manager came by and asked me how everything was, and even though I don't usually complain, I did state it was over salted.  He offered banana pudding but I declined.  He then offered to reduce the price by half, which I accepted.  He did go on to say, that this being a new location, that the kitchen may not be up to speed on cooking.  North Carolina is not known for brisket or burnt ends, and this was an understatement.  The Smoke Pit in Concord does a fairly decent job on burnt ends but I'll have to pass on the Midwood Smokehouse version if I should ever return.  Somehow I've not been chomping at the bit to return."}
{"text":"Pros: Good music on radio.They played Todd Rundgren during dinner  Lots of server attention  Decent selection of draft beer  Pulled pork was good  Corn side was good  Portions were large  Cons,  Hush puppies were unbeatable.Awful  Beef brisket was waaaay too salty  Mac and cheese was a fried puck with cheese sauce   Tiny serving of vinegar sauce  Expensive$24 for two meat platter with one beer.NYC prices"}
{"text":"Why do BBQ joints think that salty and spicy equals flavor.  Let the wood do the work.  We ordered the sample platter and it was disappointing to say the least. The rub used on the ribs was too spicy and had the consistency of sawdust. The fatty Brisket was just fat. The pulled pork was sautéed in cayenne pepper and habanero as well as some kind of mystery spice. (It may have been hippie strength pepper spray). The management seemed very defensive when we tried to ask questions.  The servers seemed ok. All in all we won't be going back since there are many truly good BBQ places around and we don't have to lower our standards by going to Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"I've been reading yelp reviews saying this was the best BBQ in Charlotte. I can say they didn't disappoint. We went during a relatively off time I thought, but it was still packed out. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table (not bad). I got the pulled port plate which was probably the best I've ever had. Sometimes you get this and it has a lot of fat in it. Not this one. Very lean, very tasty. My wife got the brisket, which was excellent also. We also grabbed the bacon wrapped jalepeno's as a appetizer. These things are amazing. We had fried pickles also, which were good, but those Jalapeno's went first. I would say, at this point, the new standard for BBQ has been set."}
{"text":"Really good food here!  Well worth the wait on a weekend.  I enjoy the outdoor area where it's a little quieter.  The service has always been attentive."}
{"text":"No place can beat this place when it comes to BBQ and ribs. When I come, I usually get the Well Fed combo platter (sometimes Pig Out when really hungry) and the 4 proteins I choose are Carolina chopped pork, Saint Louis style pork ribs, beef brisket, and pulled chicken BBQ. It comes with hushpuppies and two sides (I absolutely love their cream corn hands down). The BBQ sauce there is absolutely delicious and I can't get enough of it. Service is great and efficient. It doesn't take us long to order because we get the same thing and the wait is relatively short. I definitely recommend everyone to download their reservation app to reserve a table rather than driving there and waiting till your table is ready. Parking is very limited that sometimes you might have to park at the shopping village lot across the street if it's filled. Servers are very friendly and helpful. This place gets a lot of business, especially since it's not that far from uptown and everyone enjoys walking around the Plaza Midwood location."}
{"text":"First time ate here I had the chicken and did not like it. But the 2nd time I had the brisket and my opinion went up 3-4 points! Omg, it is the best! Lean, flavor packed, not too salty or spicy, all around perfect! The best stomach-full up meal is that with mac & cheese, which is almost as delicious. Good hush puppies too, they give you just enough so you don't get full on them. Their sauces are pretty spicy, but I personally did not need them for my food. The restaurant is big and gets crowded and there can be a wait. But they're never long. And the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never tried this place when I lived in Charlotte! I'm so glad I bookmared Midwood to try out on a recent return visit to Queen City. My friend and I were visiting and I was showing her a true southern time.,, Meaning lots of BBQ of course. I thought this place would be a great fit to see the funky/cool plaza scene and eat some great food! Dannngggg (in true southern fashion)- this place is awesome!  We sat outside and enjoyed the afternoon, ordered some sweet tea. It's insanely sweet, I recommend getting half & half. (sweet and unsweetened). Our waiter was helpful and made some good recommendations. The pulled pork sandwich was southern goodness at it's finest. We also ordered the works- sweet potato fries, hush puppies, mac and cheese and grilled veggies! Everything was so delicious! The mac & cheese was out of this world. To make it even better, our meal averaged 10 bucks a person. Doesn't get better than that.... parking can be tough just fyi."}
{"text":"The 1930 Cheesesteak is not your ordinary cheesesteak. It was so much more, using brisket as the meat and white cheddar. I might have to come back just for that! The sweet potato fries were on point, as well. The house sauce was a pleasant surprise, as well - I'm not usually a sweet sauce person, but it had just enough tang to win me over. Fun atmosphere, too, and way bigger than it looks from the outside. Might have to chill at the bar, next time."}
{"text":"I went around 1:30 near the end of the Lunch Rush. I was greeted with a smile and immediately seated. I admit I was a bit rude as I was on my cell phone. However, the waitress handled it nicely and checked on me until I was ready. She made recommendations & answered any questions that I had. I ordered the Small plate of Chicken BBQ with Mac & Cheese. It came with Hush Puppies & Pickled Onions. I also ordered a side of Texas Toast. The chicken was really good. It was Tender & Flavorful without too much sauce. The Mac & Cheese was also surprisingly good for a restaurant. It was creamy and the top was layered with real cheese and they used seasoning/salt lol. A lot of restaurant Mac & Cheese is bland so I appreciate that. Hush Puppies were good, your average hush puppy. I also enjoyed the pickled onions. I can't really explain them but they were good. I ended up mixing them into my chicken. The Texas Toast was OK. I ordered it thinking I would need something to put my chicken on but I could have went without. It was buttered and toasted to a crisp (Not hard). I prefer my Texas toast to be a bit more soft. But it still wasn't bad. Decor wise it was ok. I'm not one to really notice the decor unless something about it bothers me. The only complaint I have is the booths are high with no foot rest. I felt like all the blood in my legs was rushing to my feet and got uncomfortable so I boxed most of my food to eat later. They do have a few tables but not many. I will be giving this place another try. I'd like to try the ribs, they looked delicious!"}
{"text":"It has been quite some time since I've found a place for BBQ - of course I haven't really been craving it in a while either.  I had driven by this place countless times (usually on my way to the other great restaurants in the area) but I am glad I finally made a stop in to experience it.  I was super early to meet my friend, so I just hung out at the bar and took advantage of their drink specials.  The bartender(s) were super nice and quick and the bar did fill up rather quickly around dinner time.  Take out orders are also handled/processed at the bar so they got super super busy.  It was nice to see that the bar can multi-task without losing any composure.  When my friend did finally arrive, we ended up sitting at a bar instead of getting a table so I didn't have to close out or anything, but it seems like a lot of people have a drink at the bar and then go have their meal in the dinning room when their party arrives.  We ended up getting a smattering of BBQ... the \"Pig Out\" plate that included:  Pulled Pork, BBQ Chicken, Ribs, and their brisket (Oh! and two sides) - went with the mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapenos.  The brisket was melt-in-your-mouth and the bbq was super tasty and everything I had dreamed it should be.  This is my new go-to BBQ place based on my first visit.  Judging my the constant stream of patrons coming through the doors... looks like I may have joined everyone else as well (just a bit late)."}
{"text":"Three words alone makes this place worth a 4-star review:  Bacon wrapped Jalapenos.   These are the best appetizer and side ever known to man.  Just the right amount of heat and then what isn't good with bacon?  Aside from that, I came here for the ribs which came recommended and they did not disappoint.  They were tender and sauced.  You could get them dry as well but I prefer mine wet.  Everything else on the sampler platter was ok.  The pork was decent but not one of my favorites around town and the chicken was a little dry.  The mac n cheese is one of the better ones around town.  They have local beer specials on Mondays and other specials the rest of the week.  Service wise, they are decent although nothing really stands out with the service."}
{"text":"Good food very good service. . The restaurant was busy but we were able to take are time and injoy are meal with out being rushed"}
{"text":"I mean, this is really REALLY good BBQ. I don't know what else to say about that.  I had a lunch special here once with a cheerwine-based sauce on wings. WHO DOES THAT? ugh. So good."}
{"text":"Beef brisket is on point, opted for both (fatty & lean), very tender and has the smokey taste to it. 8oz plate portion with one side is more than enough including the hushpuppies to fill you up.  Sweet potato fries were the best I've had in Charlotte, on the crispy side with sea salt on top were great! The beer list is diverse and the prices are very fair"}
{"text":"Got the combo platter and the ribs were the best I've tasted in the six years we have lived in the Charlotte area!  Sausage and brisket were pretty good, but coming from Texas it was not quite up to that five star level.  Will absolutely go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of my favorite BBQ in the Queen City.  As others have said, this is definitely a place that you would want to bring out of towners to.  Food I love:  *Brisket - combo of lean and fatty. Not too smokey, seasoned perfectly, tender and delicious. *Bacon wrapped jalapenos - these are the business and a must for me every time I eat here. The saltiness and smokiness from the bacon is a perfect combination with these jalapenos. Not fried and cooked to perfection. *Collards - seasoned very nice, tender and made in house.  *Smoked Wings - I read another review where it says they are pink in the middle but these are smoked wings and will be pinkish due to the cooking process. Do not let this deter you from their deliciousness. *Salmon - just as good as the brisket, ask for at least medium.  *Mac and cheese - won't make you slap your momma but don't sleep on it. It is quite cheesy and tasty.  I won't go anywhere else for brisket. Midwood has converted me."}
{"text":"Top spot for Barbecue in the Queen City.  Hands down probably one of the best barbecue in the area. Let's just jump into the food since it is well deserving of the 5 stars.   I ordered the beef brisket that was cooked to near perfection. It was all the juices and literally melted in your mouth. The brisket was not dry and carried a mild smoke flavored. The brisket had a nice smoked ring on the meat. My sides included baked beans and smoked veggies which were nicely prepared. The bake beans were prepared with a nice balance of spice, sweetness and smokiness. The veggies had a nice smokey flavor but still were crunchy and fresh.   My wife ordered the half of chicken and ribs (large portion)!! The chicken was tender and carried a nice smoked flavor (well balance). The ribs seemed to be amazing since she left no visible signs of the once ribs.   The server did a great job being on top of everything and made up for our food being late (free hushpuppies).   But there is one small suggestion that we would like to make; change of ambiance. This involves a lighter dinning room area (more light to dark) and patio area that can provide some shade (yes I know its the south and get over it, but it would have been nice for shade.)   However, the food was overall to epic to give a rating lower than a 4 star.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Our service was top notch!!! Beers were delicious as was the nachos and the pig out!!! Couldn't eat it all so we ordered desserts to go also..definitely will be back!! Damn good bbq for date night!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte back in June, my favorite meal of the weekend and I had some pretty good ones. The brisket entree I had was fantastic"}
{"text":"Went to midwood last night.  Very busy.  I had the beef brisket, beans and BBQ slaw.  Brisket and slaw was good but the beans let a lot to be desired.  My wife had the BBQ pork and greens.  She liked the greens a lot but the pork was way overlooked, dry and way to salty.  They could do a lot better job.  She wishes she had got a vegetable plate instead."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokehouse is one of my favorite places to eat barbecue and I personally think it's one of the best in the Charlotte area. Not only are the meats and sauces very flavorful, but the portions are very good, the prices reasonable and the service staff has always been attentive. Of course, there are many other things to eat besides barbecue, but let's face it, that's what everyone comes here for. The other dishes are great as well, sandwiches, salads etc but the barbecue is awesome and that's what's going to bring you back."}
{"text":"My wife and I gave this place a try way back when it first opened and we thought it was terrible and haven't been back since.  Last night we were in Plaza Midwood with family who wanted BBQ so we decided to give it another shot. WOW, you've come a long way Midwood Smoke House!!  There were 4 of us and everyone was very pleased with their dinners which included shredded chicken, salad with pulled pork, smoked wings and the burnt ends plate.   The shredded chicken was good but this was the least impressive meal of the bunch. It lacked smoke flavor and almost had a 'watered down' taste. The burnt ends dinner was excellent. The meat has a good smoke flavor, it was moist and tender to the point you could cut it with a fork. I did however think that for an $18.50 dinner the meat portion was a little on the small side. The smoked wings were very good, cooked perfect.  The salad with pulled pork was large and although I didn't try it I was told it was excellent as well.   The sides, I was able to try the mac and cheese, greens and BBQ beans. Mac and cheese is on point. It is moist and has a great flavor unlike at some places were it dries out and has a bland taste. The collard greens were really good, not to salty as they can be from time to time and had a nice amount of meat mixed in. The BBQ beans were a hit as well.   If you're like us and tried this place a while ago and weren't happy it is definitely worth a second try, they seem to have come into their own and it's pretty dam good now."}
{"text":"If you just came for the sausage it'll be totally worth it. A small plate comes out to about $19 for one meat and the sausage and hush puppies and one side. Kind of pricey imo but the service was great and quick. I sat at the bar and watched the constant flow of to go orders.  Let's go back to the sausage though- when you bite into that warm weenie the cheese exploded out ! I don't know if they change the flavors of their sausage but A+. Server said burnt ends and brisket was the most popular stuff. Brisket came lean, mixed and fatty. I got mixed- very tasty. I think it'll be more worth it if I got a plate with more meats. There seems to be a decent amount of street parking."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4. I have eaten here many times when in Charlotte for business.  The sides are OK, the beans are my favorite.  Mac n cheese is mediocre and the smoked vegetables are not that great.  Best meat here is the ribs, which can come with either dry rub or wet sauce.  I usually get the dry rubbed ribs and dip them in BBQ sauce separately.  The burnt ends were average.  The pulled pork was OK, nothing special.    I did come here once on a Tuesday at ~7PM and they were out of ribs, but that has only happened once.  Beer selection is decent and prices are good.  Overall a good eat and you know what you are going to get. I'll be back."}
{"text":"For the longest time, my wife and I would trek to the original Midwood in Plaza-Midwood and on every visit, make the case to the manager on duty for a Lake Norman location.  Well, they've been open for a while now in Birkdale Village and all I can say is Hooray!  Near as we can tell, same great cue, same great service, whiskey collection, cocktails, etc, etc.  Having them so close has also helped me expand my ordering to things beyond the barbecue since I know I can get that without the previous commute.  I've used that to try things like the Cuban sandwich, both burgers on the menu, the cheese steak, the tacos and the chopped salad (Hint, the small chopped salad is PLENTY for one) and all that I have tried has been really good.  They are also an excellent takeout option with easy online ordering and pick up at the bar. Finally, if you're really feeling like a sloth or maybe want cue but realized it's Friday night and you may have already had one too many as you try to erase the pain of the ole 9 to 5... Door Dash delivery can hook you up!"}
{"text":"Second visit and it was every bit as good as the first.  Went with my wife and our neighbor and had another meal of excellent barbecue, cold drinks and on point service.  This time I opted for a combo platter which I believe was a new option on the menu.  Four meats and two sides served in either a \"Well Fed\" or \"Pig Out\" portion.  Trust me, the well fed version is PLENTY!  Got pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs and double beef brisket since they were out of the smoked sausage.  It was all wonderful.  Smokey, moist with nice bark on the pork and the brisket.  The ribs were fall off the bone and just delicious.  It really is a lot of food.  Ended up taking some of all of it home so, I can't imagine what the pig out portion is like.  My wife and friend split the large pulled chicken plate and again, way more than they could eat.  The chicken is moist and served mixed up with the Smokehouse's slightly sweet mustard sauce.  For sides we shared fries, coleslaw and creamed corn and they were all delish as well.  I had a couple $1.50 PBR drafts and the girls had margaritas which they dubbed, \"best I've had in a long while\".  It will be doubtful I will get my wife to any other barbecue place after this experience as she dubbed it, best barbecue she's had since we moved to Charlotte in 2002."}
{"text":"The food - you just want you be rolled out of there. Meat meat and more meat. Comfort comfort and more comfort. Greens, Mac and cheese and tender meat. Workout and skip a meal before going. However they will run out of things like ribs... so go early. That can be frustrating but it is fresh and from local suppliers.  I was so full I cant recall having cocktails but BBQ is best with beer anyway!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious!! Cool diverse spot we decided to checkout since the reviews were so good. We ordered the 4 meat sharable platter which had brisket, pulled pork, ribs and brisket pieces? I forget what they were called but they were the ends of the brisket with extra yumminess. The sides! OMG. The mac n cheese, the baked beans and the hush puppies were out of this world! Whenever I visit NC again, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great brisket, excellent service!!! Went as family celebration.  Food was the best!  Service was excellent wish we had a restaurant near home.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"We started out with the pulled pork queso which was friggin delicious. My wife had the pulled pork with baked beans and cream corn and I had the brisket and pimento cheese melt and mac n cheese. Kinda made me wanna move to NC. Monica the bartender was awesome. Couldn't be more blown away with the whole experience."}
