{"text":"There was more entertainment than one of the top 5 nightclubs in North America (according to IDMA nominations)"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception for 80 people here and had an exceptional experience. The food was delicious with generous portion sizes, the live performances added just the right amount of energy to the evening, and the venue itself is ornately decorated -  fitting the joyous atmosphere. All of our guests had a great time and most importantly of all, we couldn't have envisioned the night going any better. Highly recommended for any large event."}
{"text":"I have been to this Russian banquet hall twice and I loved it every time.

Food is amazing, the previous review from Karyn B. tells you why! :) And yes I love the fact that you have a choice for your main.

Interior design, show and the music is great.  Definitely oriented for younger generation."}
{"text":"Decor - beautiful, faux gold colored room, plates and chairs. The venue sets up a photo backdrop near entertance, has a small bar, good sized lobby, room should hold 200 people. 

Service - horrible!!!!! we were all seated so closely that no one was able to get up unless someone beside them moved their chairs out. We had to be careful with moving out glasses and plates due to the fact everything was stacked- some plates were placed on top others.

Waitress staff was lacking, for 300 people maybe there were around 8-10 staff members serving tables. I think we got the worse server in the world. Our glass broke, she picked up half from the ground and left the other smashed pieces for us to pick up. We brought our own liquor (BYOB) benefit of  a Russian hall, due to having different liqours all were poured into small pitchers and we did not know which one was what brand. Please have the bottles on the table. She even started pouring our wine into pitchers, which we requested not. 

We brought a fruit deco platter (those ones that are craved into flowers) and asked her to put that on that table in the beginning for our guests her reply was \"it isn't up to you when it's served\". Paying per 75$ plate I was expecting to get actual service, you see an empty bottle? Well remove it, there's already no room. The gratuity was added, I hope the manager Natala, or the owners get it because this waitress didn't deserve any.

Entertainment - was good, music from English to Russian. Catered to all ages. There was an entertainment staff that did different cultured dancing, singing was good too. No complaints there people were enjoying themself from fast and slow songs. Lots of birthdays where they call the person up with their cake and take a photo at the front, loved that! Photos and this service was done amazing. 

Food - amazing! Thank you for the amazing food and so many choices. So many salads, cold cuts,meat options. The owners really try with the food. All in our group loved everything. Main meals were selected personally (veal, salmon, pork etc) not lacking in the food side! 

The manager Natala tried her best, she was very caring in our concerns. Thank you. We told her about our server, I think we were unlucky, because the rest of the staff seemed professional as I've seen. This server told me we drank all the liqour, Natala said the waitress will take the remaining hard liqour left over in the pitcher and pour back in the bottle. Problem solved thanks to the manager. Waitress should be stripped from that job and her cheque if she hates her job that much. 

Overall, amazing food, entertainment was good, best of all halls I've been to currently. Manager did what she could on her behalf. If the seating wasn't so close and the waitress was removed from that night, this place would have been 5."}
{"text":"The name really suits this place - you feel like a true member of the elite class when you walk in here!

From the classical wall decor to the exquisite chandeliers and aristocratic furnishings this place is the true manifestation of elegance. We have dined here numerous times, usually to celebrate our friends' birthdays, and most recently for our own wedding reception, and we still get mesmerized every time we come here.

Everything about this place is perfect. I can downright say there is no other place in this city that can even remotely match the quantity and quality of food served to you. From caviar to lobster tails, filet mignon, and rack of lamb, everything is cooked to perfection. One thing is for certain: you will not walk out of this place hungry! :)
But it's not just about the food. The service is impeccable and the cabaret shows are performed by some of the best dancers in the world (really). Great singers and DJ sets keep you on your feet all night long.

I recommend everyone to come experience this place at least once and make their own conclusions."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great experience at a great Russian restaurant!
The interior is absolutely beautiful - lots of gold, sparkle, richness - just elaborate and over the top - exactly how russians love it!
The food is outstanding - definitely the best food of any russian restaurant in Toronto
Dima (the head chef) has some amazing, unique stand out dishes; things you won't find at other Russian restaurants 
Our table had foie gras pate, crab salad, Asian inspired green salad, wedge salad, seafood, various smoked fishes and MORE and this was just the first course
The \"salad dimon\" that follows is also so tasty - a salad made from potato matchsticks, mushrooms, garlic... Just super yummy
I also like that they take your order for your main, which makes the restaurant and meal more classy, in my opinion
The music was also fun - a young band singing lots of current English songs, current Russian song, and classic Russian songs - lots of fun; I love dancing the night away
They also have a show - made up of singing, ballroom dancing, group dancing - probably the best show I've seen at any Russian restaurant in Toronto 
This place is also great for a younger generation
I had a great time and would definitely recommend

*the chef used to own the restaurant Elite - check out my review on their page as it has some more info on ordering style and some other dishes that I forgot to mention here"}
{"text":"I have been there many times because it is a family favorite for celebrating special occasions and we have never been disappointed and always enjoy ourselves there.  It is an opulent and also relaxed venue representing the best of Russian food, culture and entertainment."}
{"text":"I attended a party at elite grand banquet hall, so I can only comment on the smaller room (though we did get a peek at the big room when we were looking for a good photo spot and it was nice). It's pretty much exactly what you expect from a Russian banquet hall. It's nice, fancy and has very elaborate gold accents. 
The party room was quite small but they still had enough room for a small dance floor and also provided equipment to show videos/photos with sound (I was impressed that there were no technical difficulties in getting the videos started!) 
The food was good and plentiful and came ALL night. They were literally still bringing different courses out at 10pm. Not much was gluten free so I couldn't eat it, but those around me enjoyed it. 
I was able to eat many of the appetizers and enjoyed what I tried. There was so much food that it didn't even fit on the table! I'm assuming you can customize the food you want and you also get to take home the leftovers since you have paid for it! I don't mean picked over food on plates (obv!) but let's be real, after the 6 or 7th course, people start slowing down and there would be a lot of waste if it was just tossed. By the end the platters were barely being touched and I was happy to know it wouldn't be wasted! 
Overall a very nice banquet hall!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite it reminds me of my childhood, Amazing food you have to be there to agree with me, but you have my stamp of approval.
