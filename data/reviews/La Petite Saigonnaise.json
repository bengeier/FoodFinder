{"text":"Très bon, service rapide et gentil, pour le lunch, c'est parfait."}
{"text":"I had the pho special. Taste is mediocre and the price is affordable. Being new to the area and really craving pho I had high expectations due to the reviews on here. But no sorry...I won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone. The sizes to me are on the smaller size, compared to other places I've been and the taste was just lacking."}
{"text":"All their dishes are amazing. Price is reasonable. Arrive early during lunch to reserve your spot since it fills up quickly.   Best Vietnamese cuisine on the south shore."}
{"text":"Great food, so-so service. We had the imperial rolls that were fantastic! We also had the soup which had a super tasty broth. Definitely will be going back to try more dishes. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good, very busy at lunch and very affordable.   They are a little short staffed but the service was still good. My wife and I ordered the same thing and we both liked it quite a bit.   For the same price as a McDonald's trio you get a very flavorful and healthy alternative.   Will become a regular place to visit for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great! We liked the vermicelli dish...a very clean and healthy tasting meal."}
{"text":"I highly suggest you come for pho here if you're in the area. Maybe I haven't frequented a diverse amount of Vietnamese restaurants but this one gives you a plate of fresh greens for your pho just like they do in Vietnam (basil and mint) and it does a world of difference to your meal."}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte que La petite Saigonnaise! Nous recherchions un restaurant afin de consommer une Pho.  Nous avons trouver une petite perle de restaurant famillial Vietnamien.  Tout était succulant et les portions généreuses.  Service rapide et très amical.  Les prix sont très abordables. Essayer la soupe Saigonnaise et les grillades de boeuf et poulet laqué. Certain qu'il me reveront bientôt!"}
{"text":"Tasty fresh Vietnamese food. Definately the best and best priced in the area. I've returned here to eat many times with my girlfriend. We like Pho. :) All dishes were under 15$ last time I was there."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant, hot and delicious food, more people need to know this place!!! I personally find this vietnamese restaurant better than any other vietnamese restaurants in Montreal when we talk about pho!!! The music hahaha you'll know when you'll go!"}
