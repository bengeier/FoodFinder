{"text":"My family and I went to see their entertainment tonight. We had never been there before and didn't yet know they had just opened. We absolutely loved it. The owner was fast, friendly and made everyone feel important. The coffee house was packed with people and customer service was great! We will be back. Loved the coffees and drinks for the kids. Muffins were excellent! I now know what C O F F E E means!"}
{"text":"If you like fascism, misogyny and religious fanaticism with your coffee, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Pros: Haven't tried the drip but the Americano was excellent. Friendly service. Also has a small radio station setup where he broadcasts live on certain days of the week via a local AM radio hookup. Big screen TV on in the corner. Free wifi. Plenty of parking.  Cons: a little hard to find, don't bother looking for the address...it's in Tony's Plaza on the northwest corner of 7th st and Dunlap."}
{"text":"Find this place! It's worth it, owner is very nice, coffees are amazing, fresh tasting, perfectly blended. Support small businesses."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, yummy pastries and incredible service! Great little coffee spot that gets your coffee in your hands quickly upon arrival (but not impersonally so) with a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. John (the owner) was super knowledgeable about the coffee he serves and really fun to talk to. He was very welcoming and made me a fantastic iced americano!!! Definitely recommend this shop!"}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop owned by a super friendly family. I ordered a breakfast sandwich was made earlier in the day and toasted. Wish it was fresh but it was still pretty good. The coffee shop itself has a cool personality. There were lots of dog hairs around my table which is the only reason I'm raring life boat coffee 4/5 stars. I'm not a dog guy"}
{"text":"They were finally open when I stopped by. Pretty good cold brew coffee.  Will be by again."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome! Cool guy and great coffee. I like the vibes and it's very comfortable there"}
{"text":"Will harass you about your personal  life choices. Staff and owner think that women are only baby vessels for men to own. Stay away."}
{"text":"Sister & I came by for lunch,Joyce had Egg& cheeseBKFST,I went for the Over filled egg salad sandwich,& one to go... that good, John (owner)easy to chat with,we will go back, to check menu changes!! I also purchased Papua NG fresh ground TO ORDER, sweet,dark coffee,great taste, great fair trade priced!! Close to OK for a quick cuppa & a bite"}
{"text":"This place had the worst coffee I've tasted in a long time. Won't go back, atmosphere is hostile toward a woman's choice. And he also promotes bombing Planned Parenthood."}
{"text":"I kind of feel bad for the owner as I realize they have no idea of how to operate a coffee house.   I got an iced coffee and it was ok, although a little expensive.  I would have purchased a dessert or muffin, but nothing looked appetizing at all.   Everything was in plastic wrap and probably several days old.   It has the potential to get better, but I hope they start realizing what people want."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and a quiet spot to work or relax. One of the best kept secrets in North Central"}
{"text":"Coffee is not good... It is bitter and has a weird after taste. Also found out that this coffee shop support the prolife movement and people who bomb a option facilities. I can not rightfully spend another cent here."}
{"text":"Nothing here was anything to write home about. The business is located in Tony's Plaza- a strip mall on the corner of 7th street and Dunlap. Later discovered this place supports the ideals of the Christian right wing who believe the government owns women's reproductive organs. A portion of this places business profits support their misogynistic beliefs. I value businesses whose ownership aren't stakeholders in what goes on with my vagina. Not buying another cup of coffee so my money can fund men who want to tell me what I can or can't do with it. Will never return."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great cause. Come for coffee save a life. It doesnt get better than that."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Great balanced cup of drip coffee.  Can't wait to get back here on my next business trip and try some of the other cool drinks on the menu.    Loving the entire vibe at this place!"}
{"text":"John is amazing the coffee is way better than starbucks!! Great service great fresh pastries I wish he had more stores!!"}
{"text":"Ignore the utter nonsense from some of the reviewers like Lola S. and Cyndi K and their blabbering hysteria.   Some Yelpers are utterly foolish, emotionally immature, and set out to bring destruction upon local businesses strictly because the owner follows their own personal principles and convictions.   I go to coffee shops because I like to drink quality coffee and appreciate great service.  Fortunately, Lifeboat provides just that, and is an excellent local business.  A free country provides business owners to have their own thoughts, live by their own creed and direct support to where their heart leads them, and I personally refuse to sit idly by while people vomit hate speech coated in pure ignorance.   Shame on you Lola and Cyndi-  Yelp wasn't intended for nitwits like you."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment and was given rude service and the chi I ordered was terrible I spit it out.   I did read the news about their support of a domestic terrorist and thought I should at least try the coffee before passing judgment.  There are much better places to get great service and good chi."}
{"text":"This company is wondeful. The coffee is great, the friendship is great.  I only know of them because we order from them, but I consider Lifeboaters among my friends!  The service is great, the people are kind and welcoming, and the coffee is terrific!  Love what they do!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, employees, and coffee! Would definitely recommend this coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Good coffee but the environment is a little off for a coffee house.   Also, there is seating but there was no AC.  Turn the AC on to encourage people to sit and have a second cup. Again, good coffee."}
{"text":"Excited this place finally opened. John, the owner, was great and so is the coffee. Favorite part is their support of pro-life organizations!"}
{"text":"John, the owner is a great friendly guy who loves coffee and loves people! The decor inside is marine boat life of course and there are some yummy goodies to go with your coffee. The Rum cake is the best!! I had a Carmel macchiato iced and it was very tasty! This is a coffee shop you have to try."}
