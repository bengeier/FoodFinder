{"text":"I went to Grey Gardens with my husband weeks ago and my hatred for it is still so strong.   Here it goes...made reservations in advance for 2, when we arrived we were seated at the bar, up against a wall. When I make reservations, I expect a table. Being seated at the bar makes me feel like I am waiting for a table. We decided to move over a little so that I would not be stuck against a wall. Our waiter came over and asked us to move back to where we were originally placed as other reservations were going to be coming in. When we left around 11:30 PM, no reservations had come in...   Moving on to food...we started with oysters. When they were served to us by the kitchen staff, I asked the individual where they were from and he said \"I don't know...maybe Nova Scotia...\" Um, okay. Never experienced that before. I asked our waiter for proper miniature forks for the oysters...he told me to eat them with my dinner fork and that they did not have any special forks for oysters. Okkkkk.   Next we tried the scallops...nice and fresh but tasteless not impressive.   For our mains, I had the Gigli pasta dish...literally horrible. I think a child may have made it. Tasteless and topped with what looked like imitation bacon bits. I had to cover it in hot sauce. It was truly awful. My husband had the brisket which was pure fat, he couldn't even eat it.   Cocktails were also not outstanding. My favourite part when my rude waiter shoved the cocktail menu in my hand and said \"here\".   All in all, I would never go back to this restaurant nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal we had here last night!  The restaurant exterior and 'hood are a bit sketchy, betraying an elegant and French-rustic interior.  The place was packed and loud, we were lucky to find seating and shared a table with 5 others.  We started with a few appetizers, albacore tuna (one of only two good but less spectacular dishes), scallops, oysters, smoked fish (wow), and some amazing flame toasted bread.  We went on to the mains: Gigli noodles (basically a divine re-interpretation of macaroni & cheese), shrimp and spinach (the spinach was amazing). mackarel, and lamb (the lamb was ok, but the veggies that came with it were amazing).  All accompanied by a Reuilly Les Pierres Plates Sauvignon Blanc that was fresh and elegant.  Excellent service, friendly and unpretentious.  One of my best meals in Toronto, highly recommended."}
{"text":"A++ From the lovely interior design,  creative menu and attentive staff,  grey gardens exceeded my expectations.    On the outside its rather simple compared to other restaurants on Augusta. The inside is gorgeous! There is a communal tablet seating about 8-10 at the front window for walk ins and bar seating. The bar's white marble inspired countertop and copper finishes are beautiful.   If you're a walk in,  arrive early! My fiancé and I arrived at 6:05pm and all of the walk in seating was taken. We were kindly put onto a wait list and they called us with availability at 7  To drink,  we ordered an old fashioned and mint spritz. It's always nice to watch the bar tender prepare the orange peel of an old fashioned.   To eat, we split the Smoked Mackerel.  It comes with chips,  very easy to share and doesn't smell fishy.   For mains, we ordered the Oxtail and Duck  The duck is AMAZING -  highly recommend! It's very crispy.  It comes with rice and saukraut,  which are quite refreshing  The oxtail comes with dungeoness crab. I liked the crab more than the oxtail. Crab was perfectly cooked and for oxtail was tender.   Love this new addition to Kensington :)"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing but the music was a wide awake nightmare. I thought they were trying to be ironic by playing Britney Spears 'not yet a woman' and Avril Levine 'complicated' but the horror just kept coming. Song after song. We eventually had to leave. I'm sorry if I have offended any fans but this was not what I wanted to hear on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing staff, and amazing food!  We booked a reservation in advance but the date got messed up somehow. The staff was very quick to help us get a table despite this, and even offered some complimentary wine for the little mishap (it wasn't a big deal but I really appreciate the extra steps they took to try and get us a table!)  After getting a table, our server was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wine, and luckily there were enough open bottles for us to find the right wine.  The food came very quickly and was very delicious. The rabbit pate was probably my favorite dish that I tried!  All in all an amazing experience! Thank you so much for making it an amazing evening. I really appreciate the time you took to make sure it was a splendid evening :)"}
{"text":"Grey Gardens is just a short walk up Augusta from Dundas, and walking through the front door into the restaurant must be how it feels to walk into the Tardis for the first time.  There is a small bar at the front and an open kitchen on the right lined with barstool seating.  We sat at two seats at the bar of the kitchen or the kitchen bar..or what do you call it.  I call it hot.  Because man was it ever.  Mitch Bates, Peter Jensen and the guy who wears baseball caps were there so it was kind of like a Shoto family reunion. Seated in front of an open kitchen as we were, I think it's fair to have had expectations that might be somewhat sort of more or less like their former habitat, albeit one filtered through a Jen Agg lens..  ...but whereas the last time we were at Shoto six weeks ago, Jed Smith was holding down the fort nicely and greeted us with a very friendly \"welcome back to Shoto\" and had a few brief but nice chats with us, and everyone cooking there seemed to be having a jolly good time (I mean, they weren't all belting out '50s classics together like they do at Lick's or anything,but they seeemed content enough) at Grey Garden nobody in the kitchen seemed to be having a good time.  That said, if the price to pay for noncommunicative chefs who are all business is delicious food then by all means ignore me, amazing chefs, because this was a most excellent meal from start to finish.    The rutabaga with cheddar on it was a surprise and knowing that they were able transformed the humble rutabaga into something delicious in much the same way a truck can transform and lead Autobots should be endorsement enough of the high level of cookery here.  But it didn't' stop there.  The mushrooms with benito flakes and the sea bass were flawless. The lobster was richer than might be ideal, but the portion size saved it.  As for the ravioli, they were [colourful superlative to be inserted later.  It will be totally worth the wait.  Trust me.]  And that's putting it mildly.  As for drinks. they had Roman Candle on tap which is about as much as you could ever hope for--a delicious IPA from Ontario's--if not Canada's--best brewery. Aces.   Oddly though the other draught offering was Coors Light.  Cue record scratch wuuuh?  Why have a local, delicious craft beer beside a macro light lager that tastes like carbonated sorrow?  There are at least two craft brewed light beers in Ontario that would have better suited for the job, to say nothing of the surfeit of session IPAs.  Or if they wanted to be really obvious and gimmicky they could replace the light beer offering with Kensington's Augusta Ale.    Anyway there was also a nice list of ciders and probably the wine was good too.  I never touch the stuff.  Though we never use the term with each other and fake-spit at the ground whenever we hear it, my wife is the real \"foodie\" in the relationship and as her husband I know better than anyone how difficult she is to please, so when I tell you she can't wait to go back please be assured that this is very high praise indeed. This was the best meal we've had in a while.  Really.  Grey Gardens ticked all the boxes for service, food, pacing, décor, drinks, and steampunk copper pipe toilet paper holders."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and delectable dishes! Both the mussels and ravioli were delicious I don't think I could choose which one I liked more. Mussels had a spicy kick and ravioli had a nice delicate flavour. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant by Jen Agg!  Delicious food, great wine selection, and unpretentious service.  We had the Rabbit Pate with their house made bread, Rutabaga dish - highly recommend.. the combination of different flavours and textures make this dish incredible (even for a carnivore), Shrimp with Spinach - perfectly grilled shrimps with buttery sauteed spinach, and the stuffed chicken - super moist served with mushrooms and delectable sauce.  Great experience and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Easily my new favourite restaurant in the city. I've been three times now with another reservation tonight! Even on its second night being open, our service was gracious, detailed and attentive. We have once dropped in for wine and a quick bite after doing our Kensington shopping for a 5pm pick me up. Go here for any occasion.   The decor makes me feel like I'm wrapped in a warm cloud. Soft greens and pinks are pleasing to the eye without being too delicate. The sun drops in while it's setting for a beautiful start to the evening.   Excellent selection of wines by the glass. My favourite? The Italian dolcetto, it smells like a bouquet of roses and is soft enough to eat with fish. My favourites on the menu include the rutabaga, scallops, skate, ravioli and duck. Haven't had dessert yet but this will come tonight thankfully!   Thank you Jen for opening such a spectacular spot. It is so special!"}
{"text":"A stunningly lovely establishment in every way. Everything from the food, the decor, the lightning, the cocktails, the wine, the dinnerware, and the washroom is so cohesive and gorgeous. The food is so fresh, crisp and delicious. I had the snap peas, octopus, alkaline seafood ragu and hake. All were fantastic. A perfect place for a special dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a longtime fan of Jen Agg, and her restaurants tend to be among my top favorites - with such, I had been looking forward to visiting Grey Gardens since I first caught wind of it opening a couple years ago, and essentially was waiting for the right time and dining companion to go there with. Alas! That night came for me this past Friday. A girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves and give nod / celebrate it being Women's History Month. To say the least, I was totally satisfied and will be coming back again! I think we picked the perfect venue for ambiance, service, drinks, great food, and of course, supporting a local businesswoman,   Side note: I personally fell in love with the Black Hoof and the WOW factor of each dish (I mean, I actually dream about the bone marrow dish), the only hitch being, it's proven very hard to convince some of my less adventurous / or non-meat eating friends to accompany me. Fortunately, Grey Gardens hits a new mark by offering various dishes to a wider range of dietary restricted diners (aka, apparently all my pals). To put it simply, everything was just done right. The flavors may not have surprised and tantalized my taste buds the way the Hoof does, but that would be comparing apples to oranges, so I encourage diners (and loyalists to the Hoof) to leave expectations of such at the door and enjoy the different and delicious delights of what GG has to offer.   I started off with the Manhattan, which as always, lives up to its reputation of being perfection. For food, we began with the bread and schmaltz - and I must say, I am so happy to live in a world where schmaltz and beautifully fresh baked bread exist - especially at a steal of $5. The bread was toasty and chewy, the schmaltz melted in my mouth. Spectacular. When I started feeling full and realized I needed to pace myself for the rest of the meal - I actually felt sad. I really loved it that much (which I think is a great testament of 'simple dishes' being made really fucking great). We followed with the beef carpaccio, which is something my date orders often, but cited this as her favorite. Because I really did love the bread, I layered the carpaccio on it with schmaltz and found a new happy place for myself.   For our main, we went with the buzzed about truffle ravioli as it was recommended by everyone I know who's been there. Now I was hesitant because I find butternut squash to often be a boring filling, and my date hates truffle... rest assure fellow skeptics, it's a delight! It's a light dish, served with a dollop of sour cream and apple sauce on the side which makes it far more fun, yummy and interesting. Also worth noting - only shaved truffles are being used rather than the popular but pungent taste of truffle oil, which is why it was also a hit with my date. Next was the duck - first impression was that it was simpler than I thought, but bells and whistles aren't needed when it comes to this dish. It's all about highlighting how impeccably cut and seasoned it was. If you love duck, give it a go! We finished with the black truffle dessert and my only regret was not ordering two of them.   All in all, I aspire to have this be a regular spot for myself - it's ambiance and food are just lovely and I can't wait to go back and try other things. Yes, it is more expensive than what you usually see in the market, but this is at heart a fine dining experience just stripped of the pretentiousness that would usually come with such! When you look at it like that, it's amazingly priced. Snooty wait staff and elaborate silverware settings have been swapped out for some truly friendly and charming people and drool worthy, cozy, beautiful, décor. I need to take a moment to shout out the people who greeted and served us - thank you for being just genuinely nice and friendly! It felt like having dinner at a place where I regularly frequented rather than being a newcomer or dealing with the 'hipster prestige' so many 'cool' restaurants lay on thick. I was worried about the 2 hour limit, as we stayed 15 minutes past it, but you wouldn't even know it was in place - we weren't rushed or hustled by any means.   If like myself you're looking to treat yourself, or celebrate, or looking for a new take on fine dining, I would certainly say give Grey Gardens a shot - and order two desserts just to be safe."}
{"text":"Lovely and Wonderful. The service was perfect, and many of the dishes were outstanding.  Bread with shmaltz, Rutabaga salad, Ravioli and Pear dessert were exceptionally well done. The decor is just so beautiful, it really creates a special feeling of warmth and ease."}
{"text":"Simple decor, cozy little restaurant, great atmosphere and friendly service. Food is very creative and combines elements from around the world. Portion was just perfect, we ordered several dishes to share between the two of us. Favorites: king oyster mushroom risotto, juicy, flavorful, scrumptious. Beef tendon reminds me of home (China). And I liked the idea of paring beef tendon with eggplant, unique and interesting. The broccoli dish was also delicious. But the fish n chip was just okay among the dishes we tried. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful room, the decor and ambiance is excellent.  The service was top notch - 5/5 for service.  It was perfect, can't ask for more from a service standpoint.  The room was quite loud (doesn't bother me, but did bother my dining guest), so keep that in mind if you're going with someone who doesn't love to talk loudly during dinner.  It was easy to get a hold of the restaurant ahead of time to communicate via their reservation app; they were fast at responding to questions.  There is parking around, we parked for free on Nassau, so circle around because that area is pretty dead at nighttime, not too many restaurants or bars open late.  I found myself comparing Grey Gardens a lot to La Banane, as two very new restaurants that have been opened by former Momofuku staff and along the same very high price point.  Both beautiful rooms, so they are equal there.  But whereas La Banane's food was memorable, and discussion-worthy, making me dream of it days later, the service at La Banane was lack luster and clearly a sticking point if you read their online reviews - either too slow or too pressured, they haven't found their balance yet.  Grey Gardens, on the other hand, had perfect service, well-timed and elegant.  But the food was extremely disappointing.  To put it mildly, it was boring.  It was boring and nothing new, or creative; it wasn't filling (and we ordered from 'small' , 'medium ', and 'large', as well as desserts), it was uninspired and by tomorrow I'll have forgotten everything I ordered.  The ricotta dumplings tasted like a deconstructed matzoh ball soup.  The sweet shrimp plate was two bites, so I'm not even sure my mouth had a chance to discover if it was good or not.  The lobster pasta was too salty (something I've discovered a lot with this particular group of chefs in their past as well). The skate was good, but only because the rest of the dishes were weak -- it would not hold its own against some really delicious dishes.  Overall, I would say go for drinks, the space is beautiful for that.  Leave the eating to somewhere else.  For the two of us to feel full, with drinks, was $190."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Black Hoof fanatics. Since we started dating in 2010, we've been to every iteration and offshoot of Jen Agg's empire. Birthdays, anniversaries, date nights and our engagement photos have been Hoof-centric. I know this sounds a little obsessive ... and I'm not ashamed.   We anxiously awaited the arrival of Grey Gardens and it did not disappoint. I'm usually not in the habit of writing a review having gone to a restaurant only once, but I'm pretty amped up after tonight's experience.   Firstly, the decor and atmosphere were incredibly refined but cozy. It's a beautiful space, and the design was obviously carefully considered. I had to ask our server what was there before, and she reminded me it had been a scooter store. Unreal.   We had:  Smoked Mackerel ~ gaufrette, caper powder Leek ~ roe, buttermilk, frisse Octopus ~ peppers, shrimp, beans Ravioli ~ sweet potato, black truffle Duck ~ wild rice, sauerkraut, black trumpet Bread ~ butter and schmaltz Chocolate Cake with mushrooms and truffle  This is a sophisticated, creative menu, and we look forward to working our way through the rest of it. Everything was fantastic, but I have to say the ravioli was the real standout. We also commented that the chocolate cake was reminiscent of a McCain's Deep 'n Delicious cake in the best possible way, and our server, Kate, told us a delightful anecdote in return. The service, as with all Jen's establishments, is incredibly warm, efficient and friendly. Jake, the manager, also came by to check in on us during our meal. Congratulations to the whole team on opening what I'm sure will be a mainstay in my restaurant rotation for many years to come."}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy Friday evening relatively soon after it had opened.  I managed to snag a couple of spots up at the counter where you can watch the passionate chefs do their thing. Good stuff. I'll likely be back to try more dishes and drinks.   Oh, and go on; take a selfie in their bathroom. I recently found myself nerdily posing in DaiLo's pretty washroom (which has been open for much longer than Grey Gardens) and nerdily thought of GGs.   Highlights:   Cozy cool twinkly vibe  Smoked mackerel dip with house-made chips  The bitter cocktail (gorgeous presentation and taste to match!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the opportunity to travel to Toronto recently and reserved a spot at Grey Gardens. People go for the excellent wine selection but word is out ... they will come back over and over again for the OUTSTANDING food overseen by the humble genius that is Mitch Bates. The same Mitch Bates of Momofuku Ko / Shoto fame. Everything that we ordered (basically the entire menu) was delicious / beautifully presented and overseen by a perfect service staff. Run don't walk to get your reservation. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Sunday night and this place was pretty packed. I loved the ambiance here and service was impeccable. My husband and I got 6 plates to share. Our favourite dish of the night was definitely the Ravioli with a sweet corn filling, followed by the Smoked Fish Chips and Dip. Another dish that really wowed us was the Pork Chop. I'm usually not a fan of pork chop or pork in general, but this one was incredibly tender and flavourful. We also tried the Gigli pasta which is their version of mac and cheese. The only dish that I was a little bit disappointed with was the Scallop in crema, not because it wasn't good, but it just wasn't very exciting in flavour compared to the rest of the plates we had. We definitely plan on going back for their ravioli and smoked fish and chips!"}
{"text":"A highly recommendable place, despite some drawbacks.  We had smoked mackerel, celeriac and chips, home-made excellent chips, pungent and good smoked mackerel and celeriac, slightly sharp. The serving was small but delicious. The salt cod with Jerusalem artichokes was rich interesting textures and very distinctive flavours. The skate wing with Brussels had a sweetness in it with a sharp attack. There were no bones in the wing - brilliant, and lots of soft flesh. (The black cod looked good too, but we didn't have it). We had the duck breast which was outstanding, crisp, with wild rice and kale which I don't normally bother with but it was good.  Unusually, we had desert of crab apple ice cream, with nice nuts. (I haven't done the food justice, I was too busy paying attention to it rather than taking notes!)   There is an outstanding wine list. It is well chosen and not too overpriced. e.g. an excellent 2015 white burgundy for $78.  The service was informed, attentive and well paced.  There are two bars with sets of seats. The long one fronting the kitchen might be fun to sit at in order to observe the chefs working. The smaller one is purely a cocktail/drinks bar.  The drawbacks: - it is small, noisy, and with tables very close together."}
{"text":"Exquisite but accessible.  Dreamy, diva and delicious.  The servers are accommodating, lovely and whip smart.  The food is simple but gorgeous.  We shared the smoked mackerel, oysters and grilled bread.  The bread was smoky and charred so decadently.  Their wine selection is wonderful and unique.  They curate it based on flavour profiles - earthy, herbaceous etc.  Totally makes sense!  This place is beautiful and sensible.  What I aspire to be!  The decor is just so refreshingly detailed with love, care and fancy!  Grey scales that soothes the soul but floral and fancy tchotchkes like a Parisian flat.  I want to move in here and be best friends with Jen Agg but in lieu of that I will come here with my besties and have a delightful time toasting life."}
{"text":"No need to talk how beautiful is this restaurant. The atmosphere is great and lots of options for wine.  The food is also good ... everything is good for a cute little wine bar."}
{"text":"Simply exquisite. Beautiful white interiors with squeaky clean stylish bathrooms and friendly staff. The wines are lovely and the menu is tasty, although pricey. Still, worth it. Nothing like it in the city. A welcome upscale addition to the Kensington area."}
{"text":"Anticipation, so my SO and I hit Grey Gardens with another couple this past Saturday. We were psyched as we are massive Black Hoof/Rum bar/Cocktail Bar fans and had been tracking the development of this new spot for a while.  Upon arrival for our 8:45PM res our table wasn't quite ready yet so they invited us to have seat in their ultra cool private dinning room beside the glassed in wine cellar downstairs. For our troubles of having to wait a few minutes (and it really wasn't that long a wait) down comes the owner herself Jen Agg with glasses of sparkling \"Sorry for the wait, have a drink of us\" very classy and this set up things for a great night. Onto dinner, the space overall is really gorgeous, unique and very welcoming, the lighting was simply perfection (it's one of my things, where bad lighting can kill a great space, they nailed it here). We asked our friendly server if she'd mind just feeding us, we said we like everything and wanted a nice progression of food and she was more than happy to take on this task. She also gave a hand selecting an excellent bottle of wine that none of us had ever heard of, the Pollux from Belleviere (100% Gamay) it was to be our first bottle that we would then follow with something a bit cheaper but it was so damn good, we kept ordering it.  On to the food... We started with the smoked mackerel dip with gaufrettes, a fancy chip and dip deal that was so good that I wanted to lick the little bowl clean, then a couple of crudo courses one shrimp and the other sea bass, both were perfectly fresh and balanced. We had a clam dish with an herb broth (solid) and a beet salad dish, then beautiful ravioli with truffle stuffed with sweet potato - very decadent and tasty.  Followed by duck on wild rice and finally oxtail with crab dish (trust me it works) and then an octopus and beans dish, which was probably the most rustic dish from what we had but it ended being a top 3 favorite along with the clam dish and the ravioli. Finished up with some cheese. The place has a really sexy vibe to it and the food highlights this as well. A good date night spot for sure. Next time, I'd love to sit at one of the bar seats."}
{"text":"Waited way too long for a reserved table for 4 in such a tight space."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Toronto. The food is totally creative but unfussy -- unusual juxtapositions of really bright, appealing flavours. The leek salad was way better than you'd expect a leek salad to be. The duck is crunchy, tender, and satisfyingly salty. The beet salad is a classic caprese-type number but small cubes of crispy lamb belly put it over the top. Also, I'm not a dessert guy typically, but the huckleberry sorbet featured that evening was tremendous.  The space is impressive. It's lit by what feels like a thousand tiny lights, so it feels dim and romantic but it's also well-lit. You can actually see everything. Also, this might sound weird, but going to the washrooms is an important part of the experience. They're beautiful.  Wine menu well-curated and has some old standbys along with more eccentric picks. Had one cocktail, a citrus spritz, that was super refreshing and well-balanced.  Most impressive of all was the fact that I visited on opening night, and the kitchen was already executing dishes with bang-on perfection, and our server was lovely. I imagine it'll only get better. Nice work, guys."}
{"text":"Stopped by Grey Gardens in Kensington Market last night for dessert and a small bite. We were surprised because it was packed on a Thursday night. The hostess kindly took down our phone number and called us when a spot became available. We waited about 20-30 min and snagged seats by the bar around 8:45 pm.  The space is beautiful, yet simple - white marble, turquoise chairs, and brass pieces. Service was lovely as well - friendly, informative, and attentive, but not overbearing.   We ordered the octopus and shrimp, as well as the king oyster mushroom. Both were delicious. The octopus and shrimp were served atop a bed of mixed bean melange and red pepper puree. The shrimp were excellent - succulent, meaty and perfectly grilled. The octopus was also quite good, albeit a tad chewy. The king oyster mushroom was almost like a warm salad - meaty, mushrooms with kale tossed in a delicious lemony dressing and topped with katsuobushi. We were pleasantly surprised at how good this was, despite being a meatless dish.  For dessert, we ordered the sake-poached pear. It was served with dollops of almond butter, fried dough fritters (Timbit-sized balls of heaven that are reminiscent of churros) and the most incredibly smooth sake sorbet. Very subtle flavours, very light and sweet, but a perfect ending to the evening.  Can't wait to come back to try some other dishes, as well as drinks (they have a nice cider list!). Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  The entrance to the restaurant can best be described as unassuming. It would be easy to miss it.  Two of us arrived for dinner around 5:30 on a Sunday evening without a reservation. We were told the only seats available were at the bar, so we sat there.  The food was good, I will give it that. But there are very few vegetarian dishes, and they were not very accommodating. Here is what we ordered:  Scallop and crema - this is not at all what I was expecting. It was more like a scallop ceviche. It was a cold dish of chopped up scallop on top of crema. I asked if we could have it with the crema on the side and was immediately shot down. I really dislike when restaurants do this and do not accommodate for even slight adjustments to their menu. When the dish arrived, the scallop had literally been scooped on top of the crema, so it could easily have been prepared with the crema on the side.  Green tomatoes - this dish had dollops of chicken liver with tiny slices of fried green tomatoes on top, and then a bed of mixed greens placed on top of all of that. There was a good kick to the chicken liver, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  Shrimp and greens - about 5 pieces of grilled shrimp (cooked well) on top of a lot of buttery-oily sauce, with oily sautéed spinach on top. The shrimp were really yummy, but I found the spinach to be quite flavourless.  Mackerel - long thin piece of grilled mackerel on top of a salsa verde that was strongly flavoured with cilantro. I would avoid this dish if you don't like cilantro!!  The music was good here - a mix of Motown and indie stuff. Tip: they don't take American Express."}
{"text":"There is quite a bit to love about Grey Gardens.  *The staff has insanely good attention to detail. Everyone's movements are nearly entirely graceful and with purpose. Their muscle memory is clearly well disciplined.   *The food was gorgeous. I need to eat through this whole menu.  *Interesting wine list with fair pricing. Natural wines mostly, which is good. I know some people  go all in on natural wines but don't fully engage the guests on what and why. This place does. Just like Sev Perru does at Ten Bells NYC, so does whoever the somm is here.  *All of the spirits in the liquor program were clearly chosen well, with minimal choices somehow comprising a compelling liquor program.   *The rooms are beautiful. This is a complete experience.  I do not live in the GTA but I really hope to visit this place twice a year. This is my new favorite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Like Kensington market,  this was an unexpected space. THe difference between this and the rest of the restaurants in the market is the level of upscale and luxury it has attained but at the same time feels so incredibly cozy.  I will say this, the food was okay. The standout for us was the mackerel tataki.  Definitely, though not a deterrent to the impressive drinks menu. I must say, it's a great space to sit, drink and socialize.  Quite comfortable space.  Customer service is spot on. The hostess at the door was amazing! So friendly and positive. Definitely gave a solid first impression of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there at night. The interior design is very cute and minimal, they offer wines and cocktails. The kitchen was closed, so we couldn't try the food. Nice spot in Kingston market for after dinner drinks"}
{"text":"Grey Gardens is a beautiful restaurant & bar in Kensington market. It's probably the most posh looking place in the neighborhood. It gets quite crowded so reservation would be a good idea.   Their menu is tapas style, with a nice wine list and cocktails.  We tried their scallops and albacore, both are really fresh and light!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that this restaurant is extremely over hyped.  The dish sizes are classified as: snack, small, medium, and large. But the large is equivalent to half an appetizer at a normal restaurant. Their \"small\" is the size of two spoons of food, this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't $12-16 for a \"small\" plate, so you can only imagine how much a \"large\" plate is and how small. In short - expensive and over priced.  We ordered some from every category: oyster mushrooms, ravioli, spinach and shrimp, scallops, fried rice, and another small dish, which I can't recall the name of because it wasn't memorable.  Actually, all the dishes tasted ok. Just average. Nothing special to report on the food side.  The service was incredible, our waiter was very attentive, in fact every time we picked up the drink menu, he would appear (almost out of thin air) and ask if we needed help selecting a drink. The restaurant is small and it get louder as the night progresses which makes it hard to hear the people you're with. It's unfortunate that food portion and flavours were lacking, otherwise I would recommend going here. But I can easily say, I will not be returning.   We left there, still hungry and paid $84 a person - so you can do the math."}
{"text":"Walked in Wednesday 7:45pm with a friend. We were told it will be at least an hour wait if we want to leave our number. We had a drink and snacks nearby, got the call an hour later.   The place was still very busy and we continued to drink and snack at the bar. We had two small dishes. Kale and mushroom, sounds and looks underwhelming but we were delightfully surprised. The chef brought over crab and peas fried rice. He brought hot sauce with it but he prefers without it. We preferred with out it as well. The fried rice has its soft and crispy but not oily texture, good ratio of crab and peas, lighter kind of fried rice but still flavorful! Will definitely have it again. We added a squash ravioli with truffle. It's also yummy but I'm happy to try a different pasta next time.   Busy, mixed playlist a bit of the 80s, mixed clientele great vibe, good service. Will return soon."}
{"text":"I came here on the Sunday of the long weekend and was absolutely blown away. I recognized the Chef de Cuisine Peter Jensen from a meal at Momofuku Shoto, where he was not only unbelievably talented but also very gracious. We had the white asparagus, albacore tuna, shrimp and spinach, brisket, and a squid and snap pea dish. Every single one was incredible and so detailed. I literally cannot think of a bad thing to say. I can't wait to come back and dine here again! Thank you Jen and the team for creating such an amazing place to visit."}
{"text":"Great wine list.  Good expensive food.  Probably less pretentious than you assume it is going to be.  But still pretentious enough to feel shiny.   A menu full of hipster bait like \"schmaltz\" and \"rutabaga\".  Fashionable people pecking at tiny dishes like birds in the night.   Beautiful eyes behind cool spectacles peering into progressively empty souls.    A particularly nice wine list.  Especially for finding randomly curated bottles that you want to display to impress your wine-friends with.  Surprisingly well priced. It's almost as if they came from your own cellar, you savvy cat you.   Embrace.    Let's be honest though.  I really hate when places charge for bread.  When you're already dropping several hundred dollars for food and wine it just feels silly to have line-items devoted to 'bread' on the bill.     An interesting excursion.  Definitely worth coming to.  But you should dress a little hip.  And bring your own bread."}
{"text":"Very trendy restaurant in Kensington Market. We had the bread with schmaltz, the oysters, the ravioli, the oyster mushrooms and the broccoli to share. They recommend 5 dishes to share amongst two. Portions are not that big, but all are flavourful. We had the cheese platter for dessert, and I liked everything except for the one from Montreal, which was a blue cheese, I believe. I had some kind of fruity pineapple mocktail, which was very tropical. Nice service, trendy looking crowd. I wouldn't rush back, as there are a plethora of these types of restos in the city, but I can see why this one is popular."}
{"text":"After dining several times at Grey Gardens I can report that Grey Gardens has not once disappointed and has quickly become one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! The food is delicious and creative. The service is incredible: Knowledgable, friendly and attentive. Sitting at the chefs counter is a real treat to see the execution of the dishes up close. I am looking forward to my next visit. (Which will hopefully be soon!)"}
{"text":"Very unique and quaint restaurant. Not a standard menu but the dishes were delicious and the staff were all so eager to share their recommendations. Sitting at The chef's bar was an added treat."}
{"text":"Grey Gardens is a terrific new restaurant in Toronto! Delicious and creative food! Loved sitting at the Chef's Counter watching the dishes being prepared. Very lively atmosphere. Service was very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Another addition from Jenn Agg.   While I love the hoof, I'm not as impressed with GG in terms of food. Otherwise there are lots of ++'s to this space.    The short cocktail list yet extensive wine list I appreciate (however having a market price on gin is a little strange to me).   The space is quite nice, and taking reservations is great for a change. The food however so far hasn't impressed me much thus far. I'm really on the fence. I had some oysters, the rabbit pate, mackarel and octopus. None of the things i had were great - they were mediocre. Oysters aside, the rabbit pate tasted exactly like the kind you you can get from Quebec..I doubt it's house made (our server wouldn't answer this directly). The mackarel dish and octopus were both conceptually great, but the octopus was under, and mackarel didn't taste very fresh actually, and the salt levels were off.   I came pretty late, so I suspect it was an off night, but overall, I'm not as in love with GG as I am with the Hoof. I'll come back here for sure, and likely update this review if I see things change. Since the menu is seasonal, I expect it can only get better."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian (and aspiring/failing vegan) I don't recommend you come here to eat. There is one small veg and one medium veg dish and they are able to modify a few other dishes to be vegetarian. No large vegetarian dish offered. Nothing seemed vegan friendly so I did not bother to ask.  We tried the modified fried green tomato small dish. It was good, but not enough of the star ingredient, the fried green tomato. The pieces of tomato were too small and were overwhelmed by the breading. Also had the modified orecchiette dish (bacon removed). It was decent.  I would definitely come here again, but for drinks only. Amazing staff and ambiance. Good cocktails and wines."}
{"text":"My first visit to Grey Gardens.  It's always fully booked, but it's a good idea to go and find a seat at the bar.   Somm Jake is very knowledge and came up with a very unique wine list.  It doesn't have the big wines for the fireworks, but that's not what I am looking for. Most of the wines are not found anywhere else in the city.  Why pay more for a big name and try something different. The food portions are not generous, instead they focus on fine details and elegance.  This is exactly what I prefer."}
{"text":"I've been searching for that elusive type of restaurant... phenomenal food without the pretentious white glove service.  A place where you can enjoy creative and inventive food, great cool hip vibe, still have the attentive service of a 5 star, but not worry whether you're wearing the right brands to be sitting there.  I've found this type of place in NY, Chicago, London, and a few other places world wide but it's never found that balance in Toronto.  Well, Grey Garden checks all those boxes and more.  To call this just a wine bar is not doing it justice.  The food coming out of the kitchen just kicks your taste buds around in surprising ways and makes you want to book your next reservation before walking out the door.  A restaurant of this calibre is uniquely settled in Kensington ... it is relaxed and yet there is an obvious eye to all to the luxurious details.  Nothing is spared... everyone looks good bathed in the dying sunlight that filters in and the candle lighting just takes over in the evening.  I can only explain the room aesthetic as vintage best pieces (think old school Tiffany's) blending into a cool modern loft.  It just works so well... stunning.  As for the noise level, you can definitely have a conversation with someone.  It has a very fun soundtrack playing in the background but it's never to the point where you're yelling.    The service is on point... there's hustle & energy with a great eye to understand pacing but it's never in your face.  And it never feels like it ever judges.  Again, that balance that is hard to find but when you experience it, you just appreciate it a lot.  We were seated in the best spots... at the kitchen counter overlooking the kitchen.  We were so damn fortunate cause we saw all the amazing dishes be created but also see how calm and incredible each chef worked with each other.  The one chef helped us choose our dishes and she was NEVER wrong on her recommendations.    We did grab a cider from their large menu and there is a gorgeous wine cellar in the larger group table room below that is quite impressive.  A lot of inventive cocktails were being served as well.    As for food... where do I even start.  It's all good... change that, amazing.  Not a single misfire and watching the chefs, it's obvious why.   The last time I saw such coordination and reverence for the food was in Chicago @ Boku and Parachute.  The menu is deceivingly simple but the complexity of flavours and textures just blew my mind.    Smoked mackerel chip and dip will make you wonder why you avoided smoked fish before.  The chips are greaseless and warm from being freshly made.    The scallop crudo is vibrant and light with a good citrus kick while giving way to the sweet and soft scallops and it's punched in with crisp vegetables.    As for the ravioli... this is a must get.  If you ever see sweet potato ravioli, just order it.  Sweet and creamy sweet potato with marscapone (think the texture of freshly churned butter) is given a earthy kick of truffles.    The duck is perfectly cooked medium and it's fattiness is cut through by the acidic kick of the sauerkraut.    I got the skate and I always order it cause it's so rare to see it on the menu.  Phenomenal... crispy sear that gives away to a tender and juicy bite.  The sprouts are a nice visual balance... plus it has some crazy good sauce I cannot identify.  Probably cause I was in a food bliss at that point.    We did order from the dessert menu but was hesitant because it was clearly not following the normal sweet and cookie cutter dishes.  Most dishes has a vegetable component... do not let this deter you.  Again, it's a perfect balance.  We got the rhubarb ... lightly sweet rhubarb compote that had bite portions of a sweet and yet spiced pistachio graham cookie (I want this for Christmas cookies!), tiny bright silvers of celery to bolden up the dish and a creamy sweet yogurt that just melds everything.    The best part of the night... Jenn Agg.  She arrived mid service and started to talk to the tables.  People were coming up to her as they left to tell her how much they loved the meal or how they are fans of Black Hoof.  Since we were near the chefs, she approached us and asked how was the meal as we were eating.  I couldnt believe she took the time to have a short but great conversation with us and asked for our names in an introduction.    Overall, I honestly believe Grey Gardens is the best restaurant I've tried in Toronto and squarely puts itself among the better ones world wide I've had the fortune to try.  It would hold itself among the 1 star Michelin places I've eaten at ... easily.  It is more than your average restaurant but it's worth every cent.   If you love good food, you need to grab a reservation and experience what Toronto never had before."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try Grey Gardens. I know the restaurant hasn't been opened for long but we still wanted to give it a shot, knowing it may not be perfect. I was wrong. It was perfect. We had the smoked mackerel and chips. It was delicious and I would have ordered another if we didn't have so many other dishes coming. The raw bass was soft and delicate with fresh flavours (the celery looked pretty but didn't add to the dish-easy to push to the side), and foies gras melts in your mouth (I also don't think the side sauces were necessary but looked lovely on the plate). We also ordered the hand torn noodles with lobster. I'm still dreaming about this dish two days later. I would go back just to have another taste. The ravioli was also such a treat, the butternut squash oozing out and black truffle giving it that extra something special.  Dessert was chocolate with truffle ice cream. Amazing.  Great service and some lovely wines made the evening even more spectacular. I loved sitting at the kitchen bar so you can watch all the action.  This place was packed on a Friday night. Be sure to make a reservation because even the bar seats fill up quickly."}
{"text":"I dragged my boyfriend here under the pretenses of fabulosity, and was highly underwhelmed. The seating is very limited so rather than sit at the large communal table of 6 at the front (taken up by one patron sipping a glass of water sitting smack dab in the middle) we opted for the bar.  The wine selection is good. My bf had the mojito which consisted mostly of ice and garnishes. We ordered fish dip and chips, oysters and the ravioli. We waited a long time for the ravioli so it was comped. Thank god because $27 for 5 pieces of mediocre pasta is absurd.  The vibe wasn't what I expected. The staff:patron ratio is off. There were 4 or 5 people behind the small bar at all times (along with wait staff), yet maybe 15 patrons. Despite all of the employees the service wasn't great.  All in all, this place looks a lot more alluring in the Toronto Life articles."}
{"text":"I am a long time Black Hoof devotee -- probably going there at least once a month for the last 5 or so years -- so of course I was going to eat at Grey Gardens its opening week. I've been back four times since, so that should tell you everything you need to know about what I think.  The menu might be more ambitious and refined than at the Hoof, but that's not to say it's any more or less delicious. (That *is* to say that both menus, including Hoof 2.0 [or is it 1.5?], are very delicious.) The wine list is really, really cool, and constantly in flux, which is a good thing. And finally, the service is awesome -- I actually hate to call it \"service\"; it's just great people who know and love the food and drink here and seem to want to share that with you.  I would come here more often but I feel guilty that I already spend probably 75%+ of my dining-out dollars at Jen's restaurants."}
{"text":"After perusing the small menu, I wanted to devour EVERYTHING. Chef and Agg's business partner Mitchell Bates developed a well-edited menu that was divided into four sections: snacks, small, noodles and medium+. Like the space, the dishes employed familiar ingredients and mysterious elements. Take the scallop for example. When it arrived, it appeared more like a salsa verde, finely diced and folded into a mixture of crema, lemongrass and the kitchen's own fiesta sauce. While I was disappointed with the overall taste and lack of flavour for a scallop dish, I commend Bates for creative presentation. However, I felt as though the kitchen massacred the scallop instead letting it shine in its natural state."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Grey Gardens. I'm sure it won't be the last time. We were seated at the kitchen bar, which was not my first choice, but turned out to be an intimate place to eat and watch the chefs go about their work turning out delicious food. The waitstaff were attentive and charming. Dishes were brought at the perfect pace and we lingered over the delights of each one. The menu is a melding of the classic and the rustic. Much like the feel of Jenn Agg's bistro, Black Hoof, this restaurant brings the back to the front, with nothing to hide, and lets the good food shine. Eating at Grey Gardens delivered exactly what one would want from a dining experience.  We had a wonderful evening and will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to in Toronto. The decor is fantastic, the hosts are great, and the food and wine selection is incredible. Our fav dish was the shrimp and spinach."}
{"text":"As a newbie to Toronto--born & bred in Detroit, having wasted time in NYC & Zurich & Barcelona--this place caught my eye right off rip. Walked by and couldn't *not* go in. The decor, spectacular, the food, even better, the service: beyond.   Jen & Jake invited me to a pre-opening tasting (!) and converted me to the foodie/connoisseur ways of Toronto, giving me one sensuously additional reason to hang around, and be Canadian for a little bit. Bless.  Everything here speaks for itself. Paramount on all accounts.  Cheers Grey Gardens. Cheers."}
{"text":"I love the concept of seeing the chefs cook right in front of you. Definitely sit at the chefs counter for a different dining experience! The menu is well rounded and just enough, with ~ 20 dishes, vegetarian and meaty options. If you're looking for something different or unique in your meal, this place is good for that. Service was fine as well.   The food was flavorful, but I thought some of the dishes I had were a tad too salty/greasy."}
{"text":"This is world-class food in a trendy atmosphere. If you can overlook the other clients and some of the staff, this food is worth the expense and effort. I can't say enough good things about this kitchen and its chefs."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Decent food, long waits, excellent service  Came here for dinner on a Friday night.   ------------ Detailed review:  Dish 1 - seabass crudo 8.5/10 Seabass was perfectly seasoned, great hints of acid. However, was disappointed by the cream. We felt it added a level of heaviness to an already oily fish.   Dish 2 - rutabaga salad 6/10 The dish consists of rutabaga and aged cheddar. The proportion was off for us - too much cheese but not enough rutabaga. Half of the bites in the dish consisted of only cheese, which was disappointing because of how delicious the rutabaga tasted.   Dish 3 - clams 9.5/10 Clear standout of the meal. Clams were incredibly fresh and sweet, which worked really well with the salty ham, bitter watercress, and toasted bread. Overall really satisfying, well-balanced dish. The soup is delicious. (Minor point of improvement - the bread are at parts too burnt that it's hard to taste the rest of the dish if you eat them together).   Dish 4 - mafalde 6/10 Pasta was severely over cooked. The supple chew that one expects from freshly made pasta was distinctly absent. Quite a shame too, because the sauce was rich with great depth of flavour. The richness actually was a bit much after a few bites too, with nothing really available to lighten up the dish.  Dish 5 - duck 7/10 This was the most hyped dish of the evening. We were really looking forward to the duck. Unfortunately, it didn't really live up to its promise. The duck was under seasoned and lacked flavour. It was also room temperature. It's worth noting that despite falling short in taste, this was one of the best cooked ducks we've ever eaten. The rice had a great crisp and flavour, sauerkraut added a nice sour note to the dish.    ------------ Highlights: clams, seabass Lowlights: rutabaga salad, mafalde Length of meal: 2 hours (the duck took a long time) Final thoughts: come here for the incredible service, beautiful instagrammable food, however the taste didn't live up to its promise.   *We don't normally mention this, but the service for this restaurant is top-notch, everyone from the hostess, to the waiters, to the bartender, and even the owner were hospitable.   Would we return? Meh"}
{"text":"Cute and romantic ambiance, great for a date or dinner with the girls. The place is small, very hipster chic, and you can dine for max 2 hours. The bar seats are fun because you get to see them cook and prep, although gets pretty warm.  The food is generally pretty tasty, shareable style, lots of seafood options, but lots of the items are dairy-heavy. I only wish the portions were bigger for the price they charge. Some are ok, some are just way too small.  Servers are nice and efficient. Food and drinks for 2 were around $250 with tip. Kind of steep for what you get, and you can get more someplace else, but a little splurge for the tastebuds every once in a while is fine.  I went 3x so far and although some of the food items change seasonally, the style, portions and taste are pretty consistent."}
