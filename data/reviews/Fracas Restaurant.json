{"text":"I would like to thank the staff of Fracas for a wonderful evening. They provided a wonderful dining experience for my wife, friends and I. To our  waiter, Will, who provided wonderful service. The Sommelier, Aaron Vanderlin, who provided great insight on the wine and spirits we enjoyed.   And not to leave out the Chef Phil Romano on preparing the most wonderful meal I have had the opportunity to enjoy. I had the Porcini Crusted Black Angus Strip with Chive Gratin, Asparagus and Heirloom Tomato Jam and my wife had the Ohio City Black Pepper Gnocchi with Wild Mushrooms, English Peas, Leeks, and Grape Tomatoes in a Smoked Gouda Alfredo. Each meal was fabulously prepared with not only the taste of the food being paramount but the presentation of the food as well. I had the opportunity to speak with the Sommelier during my dining experience and was well educated on my choices of wine or spirits to pair with each of our meals. This is a first class restaurant that I will be more than willing to drive and hour back to for a great meal and good company. Thank you again and look forward to seeing all of you again.

{"text":"When something has a high cost, I, like most people, assume it has a high value.  Unfortunately, this was not true of my meal at Fracas in Cleveland Heights.  I was really looking forward to the neighborhood having a new, upscale restaurant, but I was sorely disappointed.  

We started the meal with the pretzels and cheese.  This was a good appetizer, but a little small.  My dinner mates ordered the flank steak sandwiches; I ordered the chicken pot pie.  The pot pie had a good flavor, but again, it was a really small portion.  For $16 I would have expected something a little more filling, with at least a side salad.  The flank steak tasted good enough, but AGAIN, it was such a small sandwich.  It came with a ton of french fries, but these house made fries were soggy.  I've had much better fries at fast food joints.  The ketchup that came with the fries, which I assume was house made, tasted like cocktail sauce for shrimp, which was weird and not good at all.

The atmosphere was lacking as well.  It didn't seem like many renovations were made to the space.  It did not make me feel as though I were truly in a new, swank restaurant.  I sound really old saying this, but it was too cold and too dark inside.  Also, there were weird plants and some old Christmas decorations which did not add to the ambiance.

Overall, I was really dissatisfied with my experience.  I hope the owner can either kick up the food or bring down the prices, or both, before this place turns over to yet another business."}
{"text":"Earlier in the week I made a reservation at Fracas for dinner Friday night. I received a call back to confirm on Wednesday but when my husband and I arrived at the restaurant a gentleman sweeping the floor inside informed us that the restaurant had closed! We were irritated to say the least. I guess we should have known better given the terrible reviews that have shown up on this site and others."}
{"text":"Merriam Webster defines \"Fracas:\" a noisy quarrel, a brawl.

Well, that sounds more like the old Johnny Malloy's, which used to occupy the space. But it also describes the strange clash of ideas about what this place should be. 

One reviewer lamented that such an interesting space needs food to match. I find myself having the complete opposite experience. I had the Gnocchi with blueberry sausage, and thought it was unique and fantastic. But the atmosphere and space were half-baked, at best. The building has been renovated so many times in the past twenty years, from movie theater to bar, and now to 'gastro-pub,' that it's a frankenstein of a space, with scars from every previous occupant. They had real guts opening up with virtually no renovation, and I fear this bet will cost them sorely. Sitting in a GIANT box of a room that makes up the whole restaurant with no windows is just confusing and strange. The ceiling may be more than 100 feet up. But what to do with this space? There are no easy answers. My one free suggestion would be to dangle hundreds of small lights from the ceiling down to just above our heads to create the feeling of a more intimate space. Then if people choose, they can look beyond and marvel at this awesome bizarre room. 

The service was very friendly and very attentive, but definitely inexperienced. If I were opening up a restaurant where the average entree was about $27, I'd go raid top-tier restaurants to find staff. 

It's not too late for this place to make some literal renovations. I hope they pull through."}
{"text":"Well, I sure feel like I just took some money out of my wallet and lit it on fire.

The quesadilla appetizer was decent (though a waste of duck confit), but it all went downhill from there.

The chicken pot pie entree was undersized, bland, and worth perhaps half of the $16 asking price. My wife's ribeye special, ordered medium, arrived well done in most parts and was coated with a foul-tasting char. Also offensively priced at $30. 

The only saving graces were the excellent beer selection and the pleasant (though somewhat awkward) service from our waiter and hostess. The restaurant itself, housed inside a repurposed old movie theatre, is a great idea that deserves better food to go with it. 

It's a shame that the food is so weak, because the east side needs more strong restaurants. I hope that Fracas can work out its issues.

Perhaps I was asking for trouble going to a restaurant marketed via Groupon.  Despite the discount, still paid a sum that could have gotten me a stellar meal at Greenhouse Tavern."}
{"text":"Went to Fracas tonight and it is totally worth checking out. 

Heard about the menu changes through the grapevine and was very impressed with the menu. My two friends and I ordered: an Airline chicken that came with a delicious  smoked tomato broth and organic sugar snap peas, the seared halibut had a great crispy skin served over a savory sage risotto and I got a creamy wild boar risotto. 

Each of us shared a taste with eachother and the range of flavors was astounding. Anyone could find something that they will really enjoy. 

The chef made a point to personally introduce himself to us and was able to give us recommendations straight from the kitchen. 

Plus, the service was great. Our server brought us a tasting of beers when we couldn't make an educated decision about which microbrew we would prefer. She tried tempting us with a chocolate mousse cake and a caramelized banana sundae but we were too stuffed. I can satisfy my sweet tooth Saturday while I indulge in the live music. 

Who knew?"}
{"text":"The quesadilla appetizer was very good. The pumpkin bisque had good texture but was a bit on the bland side, or needed a touch more salt. The gnocchi main course was delicious...just the right amount of spice and lots of mushrooms. It was very rich and I couldn't finish it all. My companions had the meatloaf and the chicken pot pie. The meatloaf was OK but not as good as the gnocchi. The pot pie needed something to give it more flavor. 

The wait staff tried hard but seemed inexperienced. The space was comfortable, with the high ceiling. Somehow it felt like a 1920s speakeasy. Overall, I didn't like it as much as I wanted to. We'll give them another try, to see if it was just part of working the kinks out of a new establishment."}
{"text":"I visited here a few weekends ago for a break from typical Coventry faire.  Big mistake.  The atmosphere was very bizarre.  The restaurant was too large for the two other diners and my group, and we weren't sure which demographic they were attempting to appeal to.  The music, menu, and decor suggest people who regularly eat at 5:30pm and the large beer selection and former Johnny Malloy's customers suggest... more Johnny Malloy's customers. 
    The service was certainly not awful but also not the best ever.  We had millions of empty glasses on our table, our waitress seemed unwilling to engage in conversation about the menu, and considering how few people there were in the restaurant, our food took surprisingly long.
    The strange atmosphere and less-than-ideal waitstaff wouldn't have mattered if the food was any good.  It wasn't.  The best part of the meal were the pretzel breadsticks we had as an appetizer.  My risotto was overcooked, the hamburgers overcooked, and my friend's pork chop grossly undercooked.  It was a huge pork chop which he had been thrilled to have the option to order medium rare.  After eating around the outside, he realized that the inside was completely raw and sent it back unfinished.  The chef came and apologized and said it was a common problem which begs the question- why doesn't he fix it?  I was shocked to discover that my friend was still charged full price for his inedible meal.  And for all that,  we ended paying over $30 each.  I will never go here again and will advise anyone who's interested to stay away."}
{"text":"Disappointed.

Not that I had high expectations, but I truly wanted to like this place.

Previously occupied by Johnny Malloy's, I was intrigued to see what Fracas had done to make the college-y theater meets sports bar into a \"gastro-pub\". . .

Not so much.  The beer selection was the only plus - good prices and variety.  Everything else was downhill. . .the food menu was mediocre and the service was both grating and awkward.  The atmosphere was stark - open space mixed with lots of red and black decor.

Although given a complimentary coupon for an appetizer, I will not be lured back - perhaps Fracas is going through some growing pains?  I sure hope so! 

Unless Fracas finds a way to differentiate themselves (in a good way) from La Cave or Winking Lizard, otherwise I'm not sure how they'll survive on Coventry."}
{"text":"All in all the food was probably a 3, the environment was a 4 & the service was a 4.

The place looks like it's inside an old theatre (which I believe it is).  You walk into the building & you're not walking into a restaurant, you're walking into a narthex.  Follow the long hallway down to the restaurant, which is a dimly lit area with a central bar & a stage.
The food was good (though the previous yelper commenting on the ketchup was right on).  I ordered the angus burger, which was covered in carmelized onions (probably too many) with fries.  They also had a great beer menu & offered a sampler with 4 different varieties or many micro-brews from the midwest.  Unfortunatley, we had to leave before the band started, but it looked like it was going to be a good jazz show.  Our waitress was also very patient with us, a group of 4 who spent more time talking than eating.
We had a group of four, had no appetizers, 3 drinks & 4 entrees & the total bill was roughly $65.  Not too bad."}
{"text":"The good: 
Food was good and reasonably priced and the beer selection was great. Not too long, but some really good interesting brews. 

I got the calamari appetizer and chicken sandwich. Both were very tasty. I ended up getting chips and fries with my sandwich (since they brought me the wrong side to start with). Both were homemade and delicious. 

They also had some really great live music the night we were there. 

The bad and ugly: 
Unfortunately, the service was horrible the night we were there. It wasn't just our server either. No one there seemed to know what they were doing. Our drinks were brought to the wrong table. After we pointed out their mistake, it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. Servers were walking around with plates of food asking people at tables if that is what they ordered. It was actually pretty amusing. We had fun joking around with the tables next to us about what they were going to mess up next. 

The food and beer was good enough that I will try them out again on a night when I have plenty of patience (and another coupon). Hopefully I just got their servers on a bad night."}
