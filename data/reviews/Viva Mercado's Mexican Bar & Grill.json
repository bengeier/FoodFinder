{"text":"There food used to be good & I don't know what happened but it's nasty now!!!!!!!! I ordered shrimp enchiladas & they were sour and the tortilla was falling apart like it's been sitting there!"}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing!! Our server named Gerber was so sweet and treated our table of four like royalty! Would definitely come back for the smiles all around as well as the smiles in our burritos! Once again Gerber was amazing hope to have him again as a server!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Mario is the employee there. When ever we go there we try to get his section. Food is awesome. I swear I gain 5 lbs when we leave."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, service was also amazing definitely recommend it. 
Chips and salsa amazing 
Fajitas amazing
Beer amazing"}
{"text":"On a busy Friday night we experienced wonderful service from hostess to server. Food was excellent and priced adorably. Margaritas toped it off and this party of four walked away satisfied with leftovers!
We will return! Thanks to owner Bobby for returning to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Vive Mercado's! From the minute we walked in, we were treated so well with such a friendly staff! The service was truly outstanding!! The food is delicious and very reasonable. I appreciate the vegetarian options and the various salsas. I have been to the restaurant several times for lunch, happy hour and dinner, and have been pleased every time with the food and service. We will definitely be back often!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. I have been there three times. The food got steadily worse each visit. Ordered pork green chili burrito and was too salty to eat. The pork was so over cooked it was mushy. 
The cheese on top was over cooked also. I would say Friday night was my last visit. Back to flaming fajitas."}
{"text":"Service, food, and margaritas were fantastic!! We are just visiting Vegas, but if we lived here we would  be regulars."}
{"text":"A truly great restaurant! I wish this place was packed all the time cause they deserve it. Our server was so great & brought us out some yummy grilled veggies while we were deciding on our entrees. Great margarita & dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas not to long ago and found this place. They have the best Mexican food in Vegas. All other restaurants use what seems like canned sauces for their enchilladas. Not here the sauce is fantastic"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they provide excellent customer service. The staff is friendly and professional. Sergio my waiter was great! Food is good and quality. It's pricey but your paying for quality food and outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and great location! We have never had to wait to be seated. Servers have been prompt with welcoming you, getting your drink order.  In other restaurants we often have to flag someone down to get a water or soda refill, not here. The employees are cheerful, prompt and don't waste time. They have good attitudes! They treat you like they are glad you are there and happy to serve you! They act like they truly enjoy their job and that shows in their service and the overall environment of the restaurant! Kuddos to them!"}
{"text":"I've been to Viva Mercados about 5 or 6 times.  It is a great Mexican restaurant that serves authentic Mexican food.  I ate here for Valentine's Day.  This is a solid 4 1/2 star rating.  I only rate 5 stars on flawless experiences. 

The chips and salsa are good and they also serve some bean dip for the chips.  It a took a little longer than anticipated to get my beer order. 

On this occasion, I ate the Carne Asada.  It could have used a little more flavor but in their defense, they also offer different versions of the Carne Asada with different flavor combinations. I went with the traditional.

I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, so a 4 1/2 star rating means this place is legit.  The service is above average.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even more fantastic service. Seriously the service is unbeatable. Free chips,salsa, beans, onion, jalapeño and fideo !! But seriously  though the service is unbeatable. Highly recommend! !"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!!! Prices are reasonable and staff is Awesome!!!! The ceviche is outstanding and the food is always so fresh! The margaritas are D'lish!!!
Get the skinny margarita!!!"}
{"text":"It's our second time here and we absolutely love it! We recently moved to Vegas from Phoenix and needed to find a quality Mexican restaurant in our neighborhood. I think we've found it. We always eat in the bar and the bartenders are all wonderful and friendly. Oh, and the food and drink are excellent. Great happy hour special too!"}
{"text":"Well.... I waited a while for my favorite restaurant to open. My first visit was bad because they forgot to place our orders and noticed everyone that came after us were getting their dishes. I just pushed that aside because they had just opened. Today I went and got a combo 2 tostadas for my son who does not eat much just been and cheese $15.95 for BEAN AND CHEESE..... I called Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina and they charge $12 which I believe is still a lot but much better than $15.95 AND I could hear a Mariachi band in the back ground... I picked the wrong place to dine for Mothers Day"}
{"text":"Love this  LV Mexican restaurant. It is great; the chile relleno are so good, I'd like to try a few other things, but since we moved from Vegas, we only get here once a year and it's the chile relleno of the gods. Also whatever my husband gets, he gets with nopales; usually it's steak and shrimp fajitas I think, and it makes him very happy. I can't wait until my next trip for the awesome margaritas and chile relleno."}
{"text":"I had a staff dinner here recently and was pleased with the friendly staff, including our humorous waiter.  The food is served very fresh.  I recommend the peppers and onions as well as the queso.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is still my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas,  and now my office is just a few steps away. I ate here today with some others from our Keller Williams office,  and I enjoyed it yet again. The service is always amazing,  and the food is incredible.  Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled that V.M. had reopened. We had dined at the former occupant of the location and it was horrible. My husband ordered the fish tacos and I had the Chile Colorado. Neither disappointed. The chips were fresh, the complimentary bean dip yummy and service was very good. The waiter understood that I was gluten-free and was happy to accomodate my needs."}
{"text":"First time here and we like it a lot. Better than Juan's. We'll definitely be back. The only negative I can say is what others have mentioned in that the menu is extensive... too extensive and a bit intimidating as in I don't know where to begin. Other than that the food was good, service was average which is what we expect in Vegas, and we sat outside which was nice so ambiance was good. Unlike other folks I don't think the prices were too high I think they're good for the quality of food you get and let's face it, businesses need to make money. Que Bueno Mercado's!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and had an awesome experience. The staff is very nice and our waiter Luis was GREAT. He was courteous and efficient and very friendly. I ordered the steak and pork fajitas and my date ordered the enchiladas suizas. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. They came out quickly and were very flavorful. The meat was juicy and tender, the guac is fresh and the chips, fried beans and salsa they give while you wait was delicious. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\"  mexican restaurant when I am in Las Vegas.  The warm  chips and salsa are always welcomed.  they also bring bean dip too.  the small plate if roasted peppers and onions is also great.  I always get a carne asada plate.  last nights entree came with grilled shrimp and a delicious cheese with onion enchilada.  My dinner was wonderful!  my friends both got the city fish taco plates.  both of them said that they were great.  Service was excellent.  Refills on drinks kept coming.  I felt we were really taken care of by the staff.  Although Bobby wasn't there last night, I have met him many times in the past.  He is a wonderful guy who takes pride in his restaurant."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, specially since we see how hard owner/management works.  It is actually my first review ever.
We have been coming here since they opened at this location.  Really enjoy the service, the food and the margaritas.
Today was a completely different experience.
Service was not there at all from our server.  Supporting staff was great, server could have cared less.  He actually brought dessert while we were still eating our entrees.  I know it's complementary, but there is a correct way of doing things.  If I would have been by myself, he wouldn't have gotten more than ten percent tip.
Now for my food.  These were hands down the worst carnitas I have ever eaten in my life. No, not exaggerating.  For $18.95, not ever again!  There couldn't have been more than three ounces of dried, tough pork butt on my plate.  My kid ordered the same and he hardly touched his.
Not that the server will care, sorry to say, you have lost a customer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw that this place had good reviews so we decided to give it a try. Maybe we were there on an off night,  but both of our meals were terrible. The fish in my fish tacos was freezer burnt and the beef in his burrito was burnt to a crisp."}
{"text":"Quality Mexican food!! I've never tasted such amazing tacos. Their beef and chicken are so fresh! I also love their burritos and enchiladas. I think the best part is the queso appetizer...it comes out on a skillet and is simply HEAVEN. Obsessed with this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Viva Mercado's for close to 15 years.  I don't do many reviews on Yelp, but feel like I owe Bobby one after being there a hundred times, and always having a great experience.

This is the best Mexican food in Vegas.  I really can't say I've had better Mexican food anywhere.  Do yourself a favor and go....even if it is a drive.  We live in Centennial hills and make the drive any time we want Mexican food.  There is a movie theater in the same shopping center so a great one stop for dinner and a movie.  The service is always great.  Anything with shredded beef is amazing and they have the best nachos on the planet.  I'm a creature of habit and mostly get the same thing, but everyone we take there loves it...regardless of what they order.

The waiters and staff are always very nice and quick.  Several have been there for a very long time.  Our cups are rarely empty, as anyone going by will fill it up if they see it empty.  They usually bring out a small dessert for free - which is always a nice treat for the kids.

My only complaint is that there isn't a location by us, or we would go more."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE!!!!! The waiter offered us peppers & onions with our salsa.. I said no thinking he was recommending an appetizer.. They brought it out anyhow AND IT WAS AWESOME! Great touch with the chips. Not for a second did we wait for a thing. All the servers look out to be sure no one needs a thing. The food was great and service impeccable! We will be back SOON!"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE..!! I have been coming to this restaurant since they were located in the small hole in the wall shopping center on Flamingo Rd. and have followed them regardless of what side of town they relocate to, not to mention they are now about 22/24 miles from me but trust me that does not prevent me from going every time I have a craving for some authentic delicious mexican food done by others rather than by me.

I am Mexican and know what authentic mexican food is suppose to taste like and this place is far beyond my expectations. I have tried just about everything on the menu and not a thing has disappointed me. Have to mention service is always on point. Love walking in and being greeted immediatley with a cheerful and upbeat smile. Keep up the great work and keep those delicious plates coming."}
{"text":"I can truly  say I have never had a bad meal here or when they were at their other locations. The complimentary salsa and chips with bean dip is a great way to start off along with one of the great margaritas.  I always order the enchilada de calabacitas  and a side of habanero salsa, it will blow your mind and you will remember  that meal days later. The service and managers are attentive and always fantastic, the bartenders  are very helpful in picking out a shot of tequila for you to try. They also have some Mexican brew on draft!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, and the service is fantastic. The happy hour deals are awesome."}
{"text":"We visited this place the other night for a snack.  The snack turned into a full meal and we were stuffed by the time we left.  The nachos, bean dip, and salsa were enough for a meal.  And one margarita turned into two.  Smooth, salty and refreshing and you just wanted more of them. I had two grilled fish tacos and my husband had the chicken fajitas.  Everything was flavorful, and a generous size.  We will be back for the good food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before catching a movie. Being a Saturday night, we were worried that we wouldn't be able to get in before our movie time. We were seated as soon as we walked in. The menu here is huge! I have to be honest, I was a little overwhelmed with how many choices there were. We both placed our order and I swear five minutes later, the food was at the table. 
 Both of us ordered the one item combination plates. My wife had the chicken enchilada and I had the carne asada burrito. Combination plates come with your standard fare, rice, re-fried beans and a tiny salad. One thing that wasn't standard, at least not to my knowledge, was the bowl of fideo soup that accompanies your meal. All of the side were good. I especially liked that the beans were not greasy! The burrito was tasty. My only complaint if you will, was that I felt the tortilla that was used might have been a little thin. More along the lines of an enchilada rather than a burrito. The carne asada was cooked well and was flavorful. 
 I could see myself coming back. Preferably when I have more time to look over the menu and try something else besides a combo plate. For now, I will rate this as a three star visit. The service was good. The interior was colorful and lively. So if you are in the area, give this classic restaurant at it's new location a try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food at a truly family run establishment. The staff makes you feel like family, and the food speaks for itself; fresh high quality ingredients, delicious food and generous portions! We had a big group coming in but they took care of each and every one of us, and we got our food quickly and it was sizzling hot. The ambiance of the restaurant is very pleasant both indoor and outdoor. Definitely worth the trip from the strip, and I'll make it back every time in town from now on."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was outstanding and atmosphere was nice. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great Food!! We had a large office lunch order. Everything came with names on each order and a lot of chips, salsa and guacamole on the side. Our meals were hot and very tasty.  Our office will definitely order from them again!! We used Eat 24 for our order and delivery.
I forgot an item for a co worker and the manager brought it to me right away at no charge. Outstanding customer service"}
{"text":"So glad to see our favorite Mexican restaurant is back! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"As a former Tex-Mex lover from Austin, TX, this fare is the best Las Vegas has to offer everything is so good. The servers make it exactly like you wish and will remake it if it is delivered incorrectly.

When I ask for salsa with fresh jalapeño they don't mind delivering. They offer free sauteed onions and jalapeño s upon request and their Carne and pollo Asada is very tasty. 

Our family loves this place and the owners too. Thanks Viva!"}
{"text":"yummmm - everything was delicious. Guac, salsa, bean dip, fajitas, quesadillas - everyone was satisfied and left full w/leftovers!!  
Margaritas were not the best I've ever had - could barely taste the alcohol - but otherwise the food was amazing. Super nice and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"In spite of the fact that I wrote a scathing review of Viva Mercado's shortly after their reopening in their newest location, I'm revising because Bobby has made sure that positive changes were made.  

The food has greatly improved since my early 2014 review. It's just like I remember it if not better, and I'm back to ordering on a regular basis again. 

I'm glad I didn't give up on them because they do listen to their customers' concerns and I thank them for that."}
{"text":"Long overdue review. Simply put, this is our favorite spot for Mexican in the valley. Margaritas are on point, every dish we've had is great. I had chorizo chilaquiles for lunch today, they were outstanding. The staff is always friendly and the overall atmosphere is perfect. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Very good! The happy hour was at the bar so we watched the FIFA game and ate some delicious tacos. The bartenders were all very friendly and we chatted a bit with them. Beers were delicious! $3 on happy hour."}
{"text":"We love love love Viva Mercado!! We followed Bobby from the location on Jones to the larger location on Rainbow, and were so disappointed when they closed. We have eaten at the new location in Village Square many times and it never disappoints. Food, drinks and service are always spot on. Tonight I had chicken fajitas and my husband had the tilapia...and of course we each had a Sauza Margarita. Everything was delicioso! We've tried many other Mexican restaurants, and every time we ask ourselves why?? Just stick with the best ...Viva Mercado!!"}
{"text":"Always great, my favorite mexican food restaurant! Great food, great service, great margaritas!"}
{"text":"Very Impressed! I was in the Summerlin area for business and I came across this place on Yelp. Everything exceeded my expectations. The chips and salsa, great! I asked Javier if they had a mole enchilada dish and if it was any good! He told me me \"very good\"! He was not wrong. Just the right amount of sweet and spicy. The service was also great! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I tell my friends this is \"the best Mexican Restaurant in Vegas\" and I was not disappointed when my wife and I enjoyed the happy hour on the patio yesterday.  I've been away from Las Vegas for six years and have discovered Vegas has the best authentic Mexican food, and the best of the best is here. Disclaimer: Bobby the owner always took such good care of me when he was head waiter at Viva Zapatas back in the late '70s on West Sahara and Valley View.  That devotion to his clientele shows at the restaurant he now owns. The only negative is that I didn't get to see Bobby when my wife and I stopped in yesterday."}
{"text":"My family and I went here last weekend.  First off I have to say that my parents are big fans of Viva Mercado from previous locations.  It is my Dad's favorite restaurant so they were very excited when they opened up at this location on Sahara.  The atmosphere is great, good service and everyone was super friendly.  The menu is very extensive and it was hard to decide what to get.  I ordered the same thing as my dad which was the three item combination.  I got a cheese enchilada, chili relleno and a chorizo hard shell taco.  
Okay, can I just say how happy I was with everything?  The chorizo taco was delicious, not greasy, perfectly flavored and well seasoned.  The chili relleno was the star.  It was not overly breaded, but just right and the enchilada was great as well.  My sister got the Enchiladas Suiza and they were delicious.  The sauce on them was perfectly garlicy.
The only thing is that the restaurant is located in the same center as the Regal Cinemas but across the parking lot.  It is a little difficult to see in the shopping center, but it has a big red umbrella in front of it.  They are located in the southwest corner of the center.  I can hardly wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I frequent often & always get the shrimp tacos. I've never had bad service & I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Bobby is back!!!! Food is fantastic , happy hour is the best deal in town to eat and drink!!! Happy to see the faces that make it even better than it was at Flamingo and Jones.  Don't bother with the copy cats.... Go to the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"so yum! always very good service and never that busy! so good tho they always serve chips and bean dip"}
{"text":"We loved the chips, salsa, and bean dip.  We ordered the quesadilla and the taco salad.  Great service, Great food, and a comfortable atmosphere.  The portions were so large we had leftovers.  My only complaint was that one of the waiters was wearing far too much cologne.  I want to taste my food and not his cologne."}
{"text":"best mexican food in las vegas.  great service.  a bit pricy but when you are the best people will pay it.  never had a bad thing on the menu; i go once a week"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is so good .  The bartender (javier) offers us the best service.  This place is the best Mexican restaurant in town. The pozole and menudo so good!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good 
My food I wasnt a fan of, i would rate it a 3 but everyone else liked the service a lot and thats the main reason for the 4 stars 
My rice was burned and the guacamole had no flavor. The salsa and the sopa de fideo was really good. 
I wouldn't go back there or recommend it.  

Someone got the cocktail shrimp and loved it.  The tacos rancheros where okay"}
{"text":"Viva's has always been our favorite neighborhood restaurant. We've recommended it to friends and taken visitors.  Unfortunately on our last few visits the service has been terrible. Tonight we sat at the bar area and our bartender asked us what we wanted without offering us menus. He eventually offered up the happy hour menu, but when we said we wanted to order off the regular menu he just stared blankly at us. My girlfriend had to order from memory and I asked him to go get a menu. I very clearly ordered a shrimp entree and pointed to it on the menu. Both of our entrees came with soup but it didn't get served and we had to ask for it. Then when the entrees arrived, mine was wrong. It was beef and not shrimp. No apologies from the bartender. And while offering to refill beers for the couple next to us, no one asked my girlfriend if she wanted another beer. Overall, this is extremely disappointing. I work in the service industry and rarely ever complain because mistakes happen, but this is becoming a common experience at Viva's. We won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I read all the nice reviews about this place about both food and service. I would have to say I was a bit disappointed in both. I still gave you three stars however. The food. I had the chicharrones. It tasted a bit sour, perhaps a bit too much citrus or tomatoes in the recipe. The pork was good however. About the service. This was Sunday and our server was Jose \"Tony\". Although it took awhile to get our food we ran out of chips and salsa and never once did anyone refill them. Our water glasses were refilled only once. Our server never came back to check on us or ask how the food was. The only time he came back was to deliver the bill. Senor Mercado before you say that I should have flagged down the server or yelled across the room for his attention, I shouldn't have to - especially for the prices on your menu. I'm sure with all the positive reviews in the past this was an anomaly. Your team failed and unfortunately it was I who drew the short end of the straw on this visit."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have had in my entire 70 plus years!! Living in Texas I can honestly say that I know something about Mexican food and Mercado\"s is very very special. It just doesn't get any better than this. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding!!!! WAY TO GO FOLKS."}
{"text":"The salsa and the pork tamale were good. The chorizo queso fundito was very good but pricy. My wife said her carne asada taco was excellent. My only issue was the cheese crisp. They deep fry the flour tortilla before adding the cheese. The tortilla was very greasy and overall not very good. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places since 1990s I was so glad when they moved it by my house on W Sahara and Ft Apache the food is still great and very friendly and has some of the same staff it did back in the day."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Viva Mercado's for years. It is a MUST each time I visit Las Vegas.  The menu is incredibly vast. I recently had a choose two combo with chicken tamale and a crispy beef taco. My wife had a chicken taco salad. Both were excellent.  The service very, very good, restaurant clean with good atmosphere. 
Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the reviews. Great lunch time service and the food was amazing.

It was so good we went back two days later for dinner!"}
{"text":"So excited that there is a Mexican restaurant in Summerlin that is not Macayo's! My friend and I ate there yesterday for the first time and both loved it! I got the chicken burrito combo plate and it was very yummy. She got the vegetarian taco and said the guac was sooo good. The service was excellent but the real draw for me is the bean dip! The old Guadalajara that used to be at Palace Station was my fave but this is even better! The only reason it does not get five stars is that the chips are just okay. But I can live with that!"}
{"text":"So happy with location food & service! I'm from Chicago so looking for a good spot and finding one out of town  for real is a rarity! Chris the owners son was awesome! Charged my phone for me which always wins cool points! Food was fresh and I loved the salsa variety and attention to detail with food description! Outside seating was high end and inside upscale swanky Mexican  loved it. Thank you for a great meal! Great for old, young, & families!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mercado,
I kindly appreciate your feedback. The beer that took so long was the first.  The question about temperature that I had is because I don't understand why the rice didn't come out warm nor hot. The salsa that was brought out initially was not good, our server brought out a salsa level 5 which then... I said tasted like my moms. 

I did take the albondiga soup home and it was not good at all.  The A grade was not visible Sir but I will not question you as the information is online on SNHD.

Another thing is that I nor my family drink ice tea nor water that sits on a server station because of our industry. So why would my husband want to drink \"Diluted\" mountain dew. That is where the comment came from.

I know Mexican food as my father is from Durango and my mother is from Chihuahua. I accept that nothing will be like home cooking but please don't make it sound like this is authentic.  I wish as a business owner you would consider taking constructive criticism and better the issues that your patrons make instead of defending yourself."}
{"text":"Warning! Look at your bill carefully and compare the prices to the ones on the menu. 
I went into this restaurant on a whim for lunch because I was in the area. They gave me a menu with fairly expensive items so I asked for the lunch specials and was told that was the lunch menu! 
Not wanting to take out a 2nd mortgage, I just ordered some albondigas soup (my favorite).  The menu said it was $5.95 for a bowl which is actually one of the few reasonably priced items on the menu. It took some time to be brought out even though there were only a few customers in the place. To be honest, I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because of the soup. It was fresh and delicious. probably one of the best I've had. It's when I got the bill that the problem began. I checked my bill to pay and noticed that the price of the soup on the bill was $6.95, a dollar more than the menu stated. I asked to see the menu again just to make sure. I called the hostess over and pointed out the mistake. It took almost 15 minutes to come back with a new bill. This bill was computer generated which means the price in the system is wrong.  Maybe this is an anomaly with this one item. I can't be sure. Again, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner last night.  Food and drinks were amazing and the service cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"We had eaten at Viva Mercado's several years ago at a previous location.  Usually when we return to previously visited spots, we inevitably feel disappointed because our expectations were too high and/or our memories of the experience have been inflated by the years!  I am happy to report that this visit definitely exceeded our expectations.  Everything was exceptional - from the homemade chips and salsa, frozen mango margaritas, chorizo con queso, carne asada quesadillas, steak fajitas to the incredible fried ice cream.  All of it was exceptional.  Even with all of the restaurant options Vegas has to offer, we will probably return on this trip!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is wonderful! I would recommend this place to all! Plus the bartender Jason is simply adorable!"}
{"text":"My gf and I have been fans of Viva Mercado's since their first location on Flamingo and Jones years ago, we liked them so much we even followed them to their next location on Spring Mountain and Rainbow, till it closed a few years ago. We always order the same 3 tacos and margarita special at the bar. We came to this new location expecting to be able to order the same special and were told that it no longer exists! We were also told that frequent diner stamp cards are not accepted anymore! What the heck Viva?? We can't support you any longer if you don't look out for the fan base that got you to where you are!"}
{"text":"Great place with a great atmosphere.  Our waiter Nacho was Amazing keeping constant contact making sure everything was to our liking.  The food was Amazing, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a super accommodating wait staff. Family friendly atmosphere, good drinks too! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing service, food, and ambiance. It's hard to make Mexican unique with such a saturated market, but Viva Mercado succeeds in spades!"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place, me and my friends had to try it after seeing a movie. We walked in and a waiter and hostess were just standing around chatting completely ignoring us. After we asked of we can sit outside on their nice patio (we really just wanted a few drinks after all), the hostess said there is no service outside today (mind you this was a Saturday night at 9pm). Fine, so we asked for a table and the hostess brought us to a booth...ok so we just laughed it off. We all ordered margaritas, and some apps. The pitcher of peach Margarita wad basically a slushy, I absoutely did not taste any taquila in it (this was one expensive slushy).  The service was unmemorable and subpar. Too bad because this place looks awesome, but I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best is back! After the closure of the previous location on Rainbow (a sad day when I drove up to an empty restaurant), management has found the will and the way to reopen in a new location.
While now quite distant from the usual Vegas haunts, it's worth the trek and I hope means more locals will come to appreciate this quality dining option.
This version doesn't seem to have the same seating capacity as the previous two. The decor isn't quite the same, either. But the menu, the food, the flavor and the friendly, helpful service are still top-notch. 
I felt welcome from the moment I stepped in the restaurant. My drink order was taken quickly, my server kept a close eye on things - I never waited or wanted, but he also didn't hover around the table. And my glass was never empty for longer than a minute before being refilled.
The food - just as good as ever! Quality and quantity make for a fine and filling repast. I had the two-item combo, and with the accompanying beans, rice and fideo soup, I came away satisfied and smiling.
I will return to Viva Mercado again and again whenever I'm back in town. It's nice to know you can still find a commitment to good food and fine service from Bobby Mercado."}
{"text":"One of the worst dinners for the price Roberto's food is better I would not recommend this is not worth the price .."}
{"text":"Luv the happy hour!  Always great bartenders that pay attention to you and make sure you have everything you need great job!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican spot. When I pulled up, I almost thought I was at the wrong place. It's in a strip mall and you feel like you are about to walk into a take out taco shop but when you open the door it's really quite a surprise. Very nice atmosphere, service was great, food was excellent. We were a party of six and not one of us had a bad thing to say. Can't wait to go back! Ask to be seated in Luis's section and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here.  Service was incredible.  Had the 3 taco plate with shrimp, carne asada, and chorizo tacos.  All bomb tacos.  The complimentary chips are nice and crispy.  Bean dip is very good.  Can't say I liked the salsa actually, a little bitter.  But the rest of the food was excellent.  Lots of food for a good price.  I was stuffed at the end. Waiter brought a complimentary dessert.  Yes, I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great Place!

Love the food, ambiance and service.  We stopped in late Friday night, and enjoyed a wonderful meal and terrific service.   The menu has so many items, I can't wait to get back and try more.  This time we ordered our \"standards\" to see how this place stacked up against others we frequent.  It is the BEST!  Hubby had the carne asada burrito -they make it just they way he likes it - with pico inside.  I had the comb shredded beef taco and chile relleno, very tasty. Each dish came with rice and beans, and Fideo soup.  All items were so tasty, and not at all heavy.  Of course the chips and salsa and bean dip were also excellent and plentiful.  
What really made this meal was the service and the hospitality.  Yes, it was late and abit slow so there was time for the extras, but our waiter was so friendly and quick and even brought us a nice little dessert - very yummy fried flour chips with chocolate sauce and carmel drizzle and whipped cream - on the house.  The manager, came by to ask how everything was and both of them asked us to come back.  They WANTED and ASKED for our repeat business!  Refreshing!!!  We will be back - SOON, and I am sure often - how we missed this great place just down the street I do not know.

Note:  This was the first of two \"new to us\" restaurants we tried this weekend and the other really lacked hospitality.  Viva Mercado's experience was so pleasant, (fantastic food, too or course) I wish the management team of \"other place\" would dine here to see how to bring great service.  

Thank you Viva Mercado's for a very nice experience."}
{"text":"This was just exactly what I was looking for.  Great service, fresh food with all of the accompaniments I like and a comfortable atmosphere.
The menu is so huge it is sort of hard to know where to start.  My friend and I split the Chicken Mole and the Steak Borracha.  The steak was the clear winner and even without ordering separate appetizers the portions were so large we had leftovers.  
I really liked the touch of the grilled jalapeno and look forward ot exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant. Went for my cousins birthday. Drinks took forever then I asked for a piña colada waiter asked if I wanted alcohol in it well obviously. Food took a while which I get we were a big crowd. The rice sucked. I also had water and was choking asked for a refill never got it. We brought a cake they never brought out. Then the bill. Well I was pissed and I only tipped $3 sorry you sucked. Then I hear the waiter complain that I only tipped $3. News flash bud, I understand Spanish and you deserve that $3. If it were up to me I wouldn't tip a penny but my mom insisted. So suck it bro. Dont waist your time at this place. Lindo is better. Thanks anyway won't be back."}
{"text":"This had always been one of my family's favorite restaurants.  So we chose it for my birthday celebration dinner tonight.  We mad a reservation around 3 for a 6 reservation.  When we got there, there were crickets chirping to even get our drink orders.  It took another hour to get our dinner ordered.  After voicing our discontentment, the manager on staff told us the had a couple of their ovens went out earlier and they were short staffed (which they should have disclosed before, or when we arrived so we could make a decision to wait or go somewhere else).  After many missteps (drinks wrong, being told they didn't serve peppers and onions like they ALWAYS have)  we got our cold and disappointing food 2 hours later.  The delays and overall bad service caused a rift in the family, so now the birthday dinner was a total disaster.  The manager (after being asked) comped one if the taco dinners and one cocktail despite all of the delays and general bad service.  We left disappointed and will most likely never return.  So sad the nobody was so empowered they could have done more for us.  We even told them it was a birthday when we made the reservation, but after this debacle, we didn't even have time for dessert.  It's a shame, because this used to be one of our favorite places for 20 years, but I doubt we'll come back.  I would 100% welcome feedback from the owners.  Guess we'll have to go to Lindo Michoachan where we know we'll be taken great care of."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful! The service is great. We went here last month for my dad's birthday and our waiter helped a lot with the ~surprise birthday song.~ They gave him a huge sombrero to wear while we sang and it was awesome."}
{"text":"1.  Excellent food
2.  Excellent service
3.  Free desert
4.  Quick service
5.  Great soup

{"text":"Have dined in here once with my girlfriend the place was fairly busy food was good , but the wait was really long waited about 40 minutes for an our food , they kept refilling the complimentary chips while we waited for all that time , until late the time we got our food we felt really full and couldn't even finish the half of what we ordered. I had the the steak fajita and girlfriend had the chicken even though we were frustrated with the wait but we liked the food . 5 stars for food and 1 star for service/wait. 3 stars overall,  will come back and will update my review if things are changed."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had the al pastor burrito. Pretty small for $12.95. Apparently the burrito just comes with meat. On the menu it says they'll put beans & rice inside \"on request\" so I requested it. The waiter looked at me and said \"you do get beans & rice on the side\" and I said \"I know. I'd like it in the burrito too please\" and for some reason, he didn't look too happy. 

When the food came, no beans & rice inside. Kinda figured that was gonna happen. He wasn't a great server."}
{"text":"WOW. Wonderful authentic food combined with exceptional service make for an optimal dining experience.
Coming from the Northwest (and a heartbreaking shortage of authentic Mexican cuisine), we were camping for a week when a hankering for burritos kicked us in the pants. We hopped on Yelp! and were taken right to Viva Mercado's - it was anything but a disappointment. 
Reasonable wait times and a lively, decorative atmosphere had us chomping at the bit upon catching eye and nose of the hot meals being served to parties nearby. Everything - the chips, sopa de fideo, habañero salsa, fajitas - was absolutely spot on. A perfectly balanced margarita, vegetarian and vegan friendly menu items (in Vegas?! Yes!), and the best damn service at a restaurant we've ever had were the perfect combination of filling and delicious. 
Special shout out to Ignacio, our server, for absolutely killing it on the server grind. Great job, Ignacio, I'll be asking for you every time I go to Viva Mercado's.
Overall, superbly delicious Mexican food with a friendly, energetic, and lively vibe. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Tried it out for the first time and were so pleasantly surprised! Started with a refreshing mojito, followed by their complimentary salsa and bean dip. I ordered the fish tacos and my boyfriend got the chicken steak skillet. The fish tacos were so goood!! Fish was flaky and tasty. The flour tortillas were out of this world and all the toppings brought the entire package to the next level. Their guacamole was fresh and tasty. My boyfriend skillet was seared with tequila table side, mini show :), the meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. They also had live music by a very talented gentleman, makes for a great atmosphere. Would highly recommend this place for a night out. It's a little on the fancy side, but then again it's in Summerlin, so it should be. Service was great! Our waiter Miguel was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Absolutely the nicest, fastest, best service. We had a large party and they seated us immediately and had food on the table within 30 minutes. Highly recommend the pork tamales and the super fresh guacamole."}
{"text":"This place had excellent service and great food.  Really appreciated how attentive the staff was and the extras like bean dip, soup and dessert all complimentary. Highly recommend.  Wish we had this restaurant close to home."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on the way back to Vegas from a day trip to Red Rock Canyon. The food is amazing! There was a bit of a wait and then we sat consuming chips and salsa for about 30 minutes before our order was taken, but It was well worth the wait! We will be coming back here on future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"Got the barbacoa beef.  I quadruple checked with the server (who only came once to check on us) if it was going to be sweet.  Unfortunately it was:/:/. Disgusting.  Plus they gave us flour tortillas when we ordered corn.  Not the best date night, but an interesting experience whether or not it was authentic in any way or not.  Plus it seemed like the servers and bussers were staffed only by men and the hostess/host positions were filled only with women.  I definitely don't like that.  Can't we break the glass ceiling in America even if they can't in other countries?  I want a good mix of race, sex, gender, and culture when I go out.  Rant over.

If I think that your barbacoa is disgusting, isn't that my preference?  Sorry if offended you, but I had to take a star because you didn't like my review.   I asked the server 4 times if it was sweet and he said no."}
{"text":"Love this local Mexican restaurant and love Yelp for helping us find it! Complimentary salsa and beans that accompanied warm chips was delicious. We ordered guacamole tostada and seafood enchilada. Tostada perfectly satisfied my craving for Mexican. Seafood enchilada had a bit too much lemon juice. Service in the bar table area was very good. Would enjoy dining here again."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Mexican restaurant. I am happy to say that I have ate at all three locations. Bobby and family are doing a great job.. see you next week.."}
{"text":"Way better than Lindo!!! Service was great, food was excellent, and portion size was excellent!!! And a complimentary dessert too!!"}
{"text":"OMG-  Bobby  you dont know where this is from as I made a big mistake!! Got business location mixed up.....Mercado's is great......my BAD   sorry Bobby"}
{"text":"While visiting from san diego, friends brought us in here. Great call! This place is spectacular. I had the parrilladas mariscos and Wow! Great flavors and fresh fish. Salsas were tasty and drinks good. Our waiter Mario was spot on even with a table of 9. Thanks Mario! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Mexican food and decided to walk over and check this place out.  Yep, that's right I live within walking distance.....Yikes !?!?

Anyway, based on the comments we figured it should be worth checking out and we were pleasantly surprised.  The food and service were great and reminded us of a little place we used to go back in Chicago 

The chorizo fundido was delicious and I brought back leftovers for breakfast tomorrow 
We also had the green chili pork burrito and a few other delights on my combo plate

Chips and salsa were just right as well

Our server Tony was very helpful and hardworking guy as well, so I would say this was one of our best Mexican food experiences since moving to Las Vegas.  

We will return again for sure"}
{"text":"I don't really eat that much Mexican Food but wanted something different & new place to eat so we tried this place out & it's close by I lived!! I was a lil overwhelmed by the menu cause there's so much to choose from! But I was very satisfied w/ my order, surprisingly tasty & didn't expect to get that much food! Servers were great & very clean & nice place to eat! I also got a surprised bday song from the servers & enjoyed my dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. My new favorite Mexican restaurant in town!! Large portion of chips and salsa and the meals come with Fideo soup which was excellent. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Food last night was AMAZING. We ordered fajitas and they were absolutely the best I've ever had.  I was actually sad when the plate was empty. Service is always superb never had an empty glass or had to wait for anything.   Can't wait to go back.  Keep it up your doing it right"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a totally legit sit-down Mexican spot rather than a fast-food type of establishment & I'm so glad I found it! 

I love the atmosphere here, the colors are a lot of reds and oranges inside, definitely a welcoming vibe to experience good Mexican food. Service was great, all hosts, servers and bussers are very nice & accommodating. I also love that you get delicious complementary chips, salsa & refried beans as well as soup. The menu is extensive! A bit overwhelming but I suggest opting for their combos or have your server suggest a popular dish.

I loved my flautas and soft tacos! I'm not a huge Mexican foodie but I must say, Viva Mercado's has changed me. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of Mexican food but I must say that this place was a delight. My wife and I found it using Yelp and we're definitely not disappointed. The decor was warm and inviting and the service was probably the best I've had in many many years anywhere! Our waiter was a guy named Jay and he was amazing. The entire staff worked together as a team and perhaps that's why I'm ranking the service so highly. 

Realizing that it was our first visit to the restaurant they brought us a free appetizer which was delicious and very unexpected. Our drinks were constantly filled, fresh napkins brought, and even the chips and salsa refreshed before we hit the bottom of the bowl. Finally the manager whose name is Bobby Mercado stopped by and asked how we enjoyed our experience. From the manager on down everybody was delightful and genuine. The food was very good even though I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food. My wife is the expert on Mexican food and she thoroughly enjoyed her meal. My wife and I don't have to worry about dinner tonight either because the portions were large enough where we now have another meal taken care of. We will both definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"i think we came on an off night, you could so see they have potential. we waited foreverrrr for our food and my sons kid meal took even longer than ours. both of our plates were cold in the middle. chips, salsa, fideo and bean dip to start were fab. waiter and bus boy fab. something in the kitchen was just extra slow and terrible. maybe next time?"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, loved their frozen margarita. Definitely recommend it !!! I had the asaba taco salad which was amazing. They gave me the option of replacing rice and beans with steams vegetables. Loved it !!"}
{"text":"Called up Last minute to order tacos for the VGK game that I was picked to host at 6:15 pm. (Game starts at 7pm). I rushed to put together a meal for my guests.  Thought TACOS!!  Hell yeah. Called up Viva Mercado's.  Got the owner on the call asked about a platter or just street tacos. She jumped to action and said you want 40 tacos???  No problem. I'll make it quick and nice.  So she said give me 45 min. I was excited. Lol.  I get there she's whipping her employees lol J/K. Super energetic and precise. She gets my order ready with chips beans  and salsa  all with the quickness   Got the tins home just after puck drop and my guests were blown away with my ability to put together a feast in an hours time.   Thank you Mrs Boss lady. Lol.  The tacos were amazing we ate them all. And enjoyed our Knight even though we got slaughtered    Thank you thank you thank you.  Your the best."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. Our server was Luis. I frequently done out and it has been a long time since I've had the type of service that Luis provided. I haven't yet mentioned that the food was outstanding. The carne asada fajitas were absolutely amazing. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Top notch Mexican food and a great atmosphere.

Viva Mercado's is one of our favorites and a go-to whenever we want a fun casual evening out. I have ordered several items on the menu and based on my selections- you can't go wrong. Burritos are delicious, fajitas are cooked perfectly, and their margaritas are amazing! Plus they have been known give a complimentary desert! ;)

Everyone seems to be having a good time whenever I come here. Looks like they started doing discounts if you go to the movie theatre in the shopping center and bring your ticket stub in. Sounds like a fun evening out!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour. Really good service. Super nice inside. Queso fondido is excellent."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in all of Vegas in my opinion!! The service is impeccable and the experience is completely authentic. AMAZING!! I've been coming here for years now!! Thank you all!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Vegas and the staff is friendly. I wish they had more of a margarita selection for happy hour but can't complain all margaritas are good."}
{"text":"Came here with my MIL who lives in town. The food is great! My husband's chorizo and eggs were burnt and we sent them back, BUT this I'm rating this 5 stars because everyone's food was GREAT (including his after they re-fired). The margaritas were delicious. The margaritas were excellent. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Ordered 130$ worth of take out and while we waited i asked the hostess if the group could sit in the bar area while we waited for our food. One of my friends forgot her ID but she didn't want to drink anyways. The hostess asked if she was over 21 and she said yes (she is 29) and she said \"of course. The food should be out in 20-30 mins.\" 
Unfortunately the bartender made my friend feel so awkward and told her she needed to get out of the bar area right away that it made us all feel really uncomfortable. Three of our friends already bought their drinks and were drinking. We were just going over to talk while we all waited for our food to go home. He made us feel like we were murdering someone or completely breaking the law when we asked permission beforehand. If the restaurant has a policy that someone can't be in the bar area without an ID even if they aren't sitting at the bar then it should be communicated to all the employees. The bartender wouldn't even listen to me when I told him that the hostess said we could wait here for our food. He kept saying \"this is the law so she can't be here.\" I go to red rocks every years and I'll never go to this restaurant again after how that bartender treated us. There were a lot of better ways to handle the situation."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were first timers to this place and it won't be the last time. The complementary chips and salsa and been dip is very yummy. We irdered chicken fajitas and they quick to the table and very good. Our waters were never empty the service was great. We had a server named John and he was so dedicated  about his work and you could tell. Super friendly and attentitive!"}
{"text":"Fourth time here and must say very disappointed!! The service was horrible! Sergio was seen then not seen for ever and you could tell everyone was looking around and food was coming out late from the  kitchen !

We really like this place and the atmosphere is always great but this time could be our last ! Our food took longer than usual and even getting a refill on WATER was a chore!! Just a piece of advice is to not to try and reach over people while they are eating to remove plates . I am definitely one that likes my area to be clean but manners are also just as important!!

At the end when we were done eating we were asked if we wanted dessert and my son said he would like the churros and minutes/seconds later the bill and no dessert dropped of before I could get a word in ! At this point I was like forget it but then 7 minutes or so later Sergio grabs the check and says sorry \"wrong bill\" and then gives us the churros and a new bill ! It was not the wrong bill he just forgot about the dessert and was overwhelmed!! 



We will see if we go back !!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour but got stuck in traffic... showed up at 5:55pm and thought I might be able to get in one happy hour drink BUT I lucked out as happy hour goes until 7!!! There is a small happy hour menu with food & drinks range from $5-8. I got two glasses of wine and they were nice pours ;) They give you complimentary endless chips, salsa and bean dip, all really good and were pretty on top of it, every time our basket was near bottom they refilled. I ordered the chicken street tacos, sooo good!! They give you two tacos, choice of flour or corn tortillas, and the pico de gallo to fill. Although I was stuffed after baskets of chips and tacos, they brought us a complimentary dessert, fried cinnamon chips with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Our server was great and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Looked at the menu at this place and thought it was a little pricey but stayed anyway to check it out. Unbeknownst to me they were having happy hour. They brought chips, salsa, beans, chile & onions almost right when we sat down (all free). The happy hour food we ordered was really good- as well as the house margaritas, probably on my top. Then when you think you can't take anymore, you do because you get free dessert at the end of the meal. We are definitely coming back, we feel even without the free stuff, the food and drinks were pretty darn good."}
{"text":"LOVE this food!!! I've been 3 times and had delivery once and not one thing was less than good. Literally each item I've tried - I wish I could remember them all. The margaritas are great, especially the cucumber jalapeno one!  The service is pretty good, they seem slow but the timing/pacing of drinks/chips/appetizers/entree is actually awesome. There's always time for each \"course\" and room to breathe between. 

The bean dip and salsa and grilled peppers and onions are REALLY GOOD!!  It's super easy to just fill up on these!! But save room for the fried tortilla dessert they always bring. It's so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, one word: awesome! My girlfriend and I were looking for a dinner place before a movie in the shopping center and happened upon this place. We left beyond impressed.

We were seated immediately, and Alfredo was our awesome waiter. They keep the free chips, salsa, and bean dip coming! We had a good pitcher of margarita, reasonably priced, and the food, including the sopa de fideo, was deeelish. My lady had a tamale, I had an enchilada and one of the best fish tacos I've ever had. I might just get a couple of them next time. The Mexican rice was good... I really have no complaints... Ok, one complaint... we sat by a fountain that kept splashing me. Minor considering the overall great experience.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service with Ignacio. Great food! We ordered taco salad and pork green chile burrito. The order came with chips and salsa as well as bean dip and jalapeños. Really good. My meal - burrito- came with a chicken based soup , which was just OK IMO. Atmosphere was very inviting. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular here to be sure."}
{"text":"I'm here on business so I thought I would try this place out. I got the steak burrito lunch special. It was excellent! Service was great, awesome atmosphere, and reasonably priced. You won't go wrong coming to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent mexican fare. Fresh and authentic. Service is great location is convenient. Great drinks too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and the atmosphere! I have known Bobby since I was a child and have always loved his food! My family and I enjoy the new location! Can't wait for more!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. My favorite authentic Mexican restaurant. The service here is great! This is as close to home style cooking as you can get in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to do this lol. I went earlier in the week after work with my coworker and she was definitely right, the mango margaritas are absolutely amazing. The fish tacos were delicious i even got happy like a child when the waiter brought out the banuelos. I had an overall great experience. Food was great and service was beyond exellent. I will be back and this time with my family"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to dine but decided to just have two quick drinks at the bar when we discovered very unprofessional behavior by two bartenders. They weren't wearing name tags, they were working 04-11-14 at 8:30 PM. The two males one Caucasian and one Spanish were both drinking on the job, they were more interested in their bro talk and drinking activites than engaging and servicing the customers. Also I lost my appetite when I saw the Spanish gentleman return a customers plate to the kitchen and he seriously ate a huge piece of food off of the plate when he closed the door.
Management watch these guys on video I'm sure their behavior is much worse, i was only there for twenty minutes. I would make sure they aren't stealing money too."}
{"text":"Excellent fajitas, as well as complimentary chips and salsa with bean dip. Frozen margaritas are pretty good, too, but they seem to give me super brain freezes."}
{"text":"Lots of gluten-free options the food is wonderful the service is at 10"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! After bouncing around throughout the area looking for a place to have lunch on Saturday, we finally found this place, and I'm so happy that I did! The service was great right from the get-go. Waiter recommended several killer choices ranging from chili Quiles to say he does to a monster Barito the size of a house!

So with food in order, we enjoyed her complementary chips and salsa. If you get the hankering, they have about eight other types of salsa to indulgence in.

So here's the rundown:

Satisfied? Yes

Return? Yes

Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Our waiter was great, and always there to refill our drinks or even sneak us a delicious fried tortilla dessert. The food was good, but needed just a little more seasoning for me. I will definitely go back again considering I've gone to all their locations since I was a child! So glad they are back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few more times. Ordered a couple different burritos - which were good but a little expensive for a burrito.  Better to do the lunch menu or get the combination 3 item plate.  The staff, however, is still awesome.  Very few places have I been where the service is excellent all the time.  Before you even ask for something, they bring it.  Thanks Viva Mercado, so glad you're back in business."}
{"text":"Let's just say that I finally got back onto to Yelp just to leave this place a five star rating!

Last night was our first experience at Viva Mercados. We loved the super tasty free chips, bean dip, and salsa, as well as the onions and peppers. The Fideo soup is some of the best around, and the dinner portions are giant and well worth every penny; my husband and I were able to split a meal and still leave full. Speaking of the main course, we LOVED the combination plate that we tried! The fish taco was excellent, and the shredded chicken and carne asada were both very good. And of course, the sweet treat at the end was the icing on the cake of a great meal.

Can't forget the service...our waiter was very attentive and nice, and everyone helping out offered great service as well.

We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in town. There's are a few close second but I have never had a bad meal here.

The service is always great. Their micheladas are the best I've ever had (besides in Cabo). Fresh chips with homemade salsa and the best bean dip I've ever had always hit the table immediately.

I usually sit at the bar, have a beer and some chips and do one of their unbeatable happy hour specials. 

You canta go wrong with the chicken or the steak tacos. The chicken taquitos are also tasty.

If I'm dining with someone I love their fajitas to share. The Chile relleno is also a must try. 

My friends always order the margaritas and say that they are unbeatable for taste and price. If you're in the lakes area, check this joint out.

Great price, great service, amazing Mexican food."}
{"text":"Lucked out and got here between the waves of the Friday date night crowd so we didn't wait long.  It's  much larger inside than we expected, but still only a couple small tables were open.  There's a bar on the left of the dining area, separated by a subtle divider and walkway. The staff were friendly, busy busy bees.

Chips, spiced-right salsa and warm refried beans were set out as soon as we were seated. Grilled onions and Serrano peppers were added later.  We asked our server, Tony, about Mexican beers on draft and he recommended Victoria, which he described as smooth.  It was a good cerveza that both BF and I enjoyed. Viva has an extensive menu, including pages of platillos combinations grouped by fish or seafood and meat or poultry.  These came with the typical fideo soup, rice, and refried beans.

BF tried the machaca con huevos with steak, served in his choice of corn tortillas.  He was very pleased with the flavor and portion.  I decided to try the  sizzling, flambe of carne asada borracha which had tequila and citrus notes.  Everybody always watches as a sizzling dish is brought to the table.  But it was so much more exciting to watch than to eat as, for me, it had too much of a barbeque type of flavor with way too many onions.  Still on a fiery flambe kick, we finished with the dessert of platanos (their bananas foster dish), which was a perfect way to end our date night meal.

Speaking of date night, this is a good location for a dinner-and-movies night, with the Regal Cinemas a short stroll away in the northwest corner."}
{"text":"So far in Vegas this has been the best Mexican restaurant we've been to. 
Coming from California, it is really hard to find good Mexican food like back home. 
The complimentary chips come with really good salsa and BEANS! The beans were my favorite!! The house Margarita was perfect! 
The best part for me was the service. Our server Sergio was awesome and the owner came by when we were done to see how everything went. I loved that! 
Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Certainly better than anything I have had in recent memory. 

The complimentary chips and salsa with bean dip were all excellent. They also brought a plate of grilled jalapeños and onions, which were also a nice accompaniment. 

I normally don't care for Fideo soup, but it was great! And entrees were equally as tasty.

Drinks were reasonably priced and dinner was finished off with cinnamon \"chips\" covered in chocolate and caramel.  

Excellent! Ate here at 6pm on a Sunday night. Very busy when we arrived, but cleared out by 7pm.  Will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Today was our first day to eat here and we give it a 5 stars.  It's the anniversary of my mom's passing and she loved Mexican food.  We wanted a place with a relaxing atmosphere,  Mexican music playing, and of course great food and this is it!  Loved that they brought us warm beans, chips and salsa,  mom loved beans with her chips.  We both got one of the tostada salads and they were excellent!  Only negative is it's a little more pricey then we are used to.  Next we will be coming back to try the Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Tasty. 

After a day of hiking at Valley of Fire State Park, we decided on the drive back to Vegas that Mexican food would make a great dinner. So, we went to Yelp to look for a location. 

We were seated quickly. No one judged our dusty trail tired looks. We were seated in the bar and Carlos
Took great care of us. Kept our water filled and brought our food quickly. 

The chips and salsa were fresh tasting. The chicken in both our dishes was grilled with a lemon taste. I had tacos with corn shell. My partner in dining had something similar to nachos (can't remember the name right now). 

The servings were large. The service was excellent.  The food was tasty. 

I recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The reviews are good so maybe I would like it better if I actually ate there but my takeout order was not what I expected it to be at all and for the first time trying it not sure how I feel about it now."}
{"text":"My wife's family and I came to the new location a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it! We sat outside (small patio and fills up quickly) and really enjoyed our time (happy hour margaritas definitely helped too!)

Our server, Gerber, was super nice!! He was attentive but not intrusive, and just a really nice dude. We all made sure we got his name so we could compliment him to the manager after we left.

I got the fajitas and my father in law got the quesadillas. Both were great, but I think I'd do the quesadillas when we go back again."}
{"text":"My to go to place when I'm craving for Mexican food... I love their Menudo and it's always been consistent and no after taste especially if one of the main ingredient is tripe. Their shrimp fajitas and chicharones are delisyoso! 

Everyone here are very helpful and accommodating, servers and bussers are amazing. They have their rhythm together and you know that they all work together as a team. 

Food and atmosphere are great for all ages!!! Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's closer to me than Macayos, the service was better and it's brand new so much cleaner. The chips and salsa come with bean dip. Yum! I got chicken tacos, and everything comes with rice and beans which is a huge plus. The tacos have bell peppers which aren't spicy, with feta cheese. The chicken was amazing, and I loved the spin on ingredients! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"New location, same excellent service and amazing food!  We had a long wait to be seated on Friday, but it is clearly a popular place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good HH place: 3-6PM daily, with cheap drinks (including a large $4 glass of sangria!) and multiple $5 food specials. Combine both and add in their free chips, salsa, bean dip, and grilled peppers/onions, and you've got a large meal for under $10.

Sangria isn't as fruity as I like- seemed like the fruit was added for presentation but not present in flavor. Chips weren't too oily, tasted fresh with a light sprinkle of salt. Salsa and bean dip were decent. Tried the fish tacos on the specials menu, one of the healthier options on corn tortillas with grilled fish instead of traditional fried. Filling portion, great price.

Décor is nicer than the exterior led me to expect, bartender was a really nice guy. You could spend a week hitting all the HH places in this plaza alone but this is one I might actually return for. 3.5 stars, rounding down until I try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm....  The best!  Never disappointed!  So many delicious choices but the pork is always tender and juicy!!"}
{"text":"Viva Mercado's has it all!! AMAZING FOOD! and lots of it...friendly service, very fair pricing, family dining, everything I've ordered in my 4 visits has been absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  We sat outside.  Nice server.  We just ordered happy hour snacks.  Endless chips and salsa and bean dip were available. Margarita's had a kick - so nice pour!"}
{"text":"Ordered food via eat 24, they delivered only half the order. The restaurant wont take any responsibility."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and found this place on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  Took our 4 kids and had a GREAT experience!  The food was fantastic and the service was absolutely amazing, they literally treated us like family.  We will make sure to visit every time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but the food more than made up for that.   All six of my family got something different, passed tastes around, and we couldn't finish everything!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed when I go to Viva Mercado's. 
 
The nacho appetizer with chicken and beef is a meal in itself, and is too good to pass up.  For the main entree each of us at the table ordered something different, and all 5 of us were very happy with what was ordered.  Every order came exactly as requested and was happily consumed until we could eat no more.  The entrees are huge and everyone at the table said their meal was delicious! 

To top off the great food, and add to the experience, the staff are all very friendly and they always greet us with a smile.  We never leave disappointed!

If you are looking for a great Mexican Bar and Grill, This establishment should be on your list."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile. Whether at a table or at the bar, service is fantastic! Start with chips and salsa, ask for the sautéed veggies (jalapenos and onions) tastes great with the salsa and chips. I love the pork enchiladas. Service is very fast, so if you're looking to linger, take your time ordering."}
{"text":"Yikes..not sure how this place has such high ratings. Our food was just ok. My chile colorado was so salty I couldn't finish it. Maybe ate 3 bites. It had good flavor but wayyyyy too much salt. The rice was dry and refried beans were just super cheesy & blah. The happy hour margaritas are in a very tiny glass. Hardly a deal. Its a sip. The best part was the bean dip and salsa they bring to the table. It's very overpriced.. I do not mind paying more for quality food but this aint it. I should of left when I looked around and only saw white people..no Mexicans eating here. Usually a clear indication."}
{"text":"Reserved the back room for a group gathering of 30-35 people.  Management was hard to work with to set up the dinner.  They wouldn't set the dinner up on a Friday or Saturday even though we we're making reservations more than two weeks in advance. On the night of the dinner we had 28 people show up. I was told that because we didn't have 30 people they were going to charge us $15 per person that didn't show up. I told them that was unacceptable and that we would take our business elsewhere in the future.  They did back down from the charges. The other issue we ran into with this location is that they wouldn't split the checks and only agreed to do a check for each table which created quite a bit of confusion for everyone in the party and for the server.
The food is good at this location and our server was outstanding.  But the management's lack of customer service for a large group has made our decision to take our business to one of the other Mexican restaurants an easy one."}
{"text":"Slow service... Bartender got in an argument  with a guest about warm beer glasses, margarita was watery and took forever to come out. Guacamole tasted like it had mayo in it... Bring back Chinita!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Excellent service. They start the table with bottom-less chips, homemade salsa, and beans. Next is a tomato bisque. Then your entree on a plate big enough to feed a small country, seriously my husband and I have big appetites and we could have easily shared a meal and both been full. Also complimentary fried jalapeño and grilled onions if you ask. Don't think twice about it the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Omg! Sooo good, from the chips, salsa and bean dip, to the delicious entrees! The service is exemplary. I had the seafood taquitos, and a bowl of Fidel soup, it took me back to my buelitas house, I was in heaven. What was left of the broth of my Fidel soup, I crunched up the rest of what was left of my chips, and add of the rest of the salsa and beans.........just shoot me now, I was so full I felt like I needed to be wheeled out of there. This place is well worth the Drive and the price. The margaritas are off the chain!!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy Mexican food then do not come here. 

I came in on a Saturday lunch and it was pretty busy. They gave us the usual complimentary chips and salsa with warm refried beans. The salsa was terrible. It tasted like spaghetti sauce. 

I ordered a carne sada burrito with red and green sauce. The meat was tasteless. The red sauce had zero heat and the green sauce was just okay. The rice was boring also. The portion size was huge and feed two people. 

I even asked for Tabasco to fix the problem but they didn't have it! Only Tapatio or Chula in packets which I thought was weird. Who wants to open hot sauce packets at a nice Mexican restaurant. 

I left very disappointed with my meal and will not be returning."}
{"text":"When it first opened, it was superb.  We have been there a few time since and each time the quality of service and food seems to get worse.

{"text":"Lot of rice and beans. The beef street taco was so pleasing and tasty. Scanty with salsa ... The fish taco was awful. The chile relleno was smothered in tomato sauce, quite bland. I just do not get this. The server was nice +10. But to ask many times over why Mama didn't want another margarita was just not cool. I was there for good food. Sadly...I got one third of my order RIGHT. STREET TACOS ARE YUMMY."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here! The food comes with fideo soup, and at the end they surprised us with a great sopapillas dessert! It was delicious, and the service was great. I do admit though that it comes with a lot of food. I'm stuffed but it very pretty delicious! It is more authentic Mexican food by the way. I recommend the restaurant to really any ages and it is very casual attire. There is even food for the kids (a kids menu) which turned out to be good as well. Try Viva Marcodos out some time!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the delicious Warm chips, salsa, and bean dip.  I had 3 different enchiladas, chicken, pork and beef, they were the best I have had.  Will come back the next time I visit"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and get drinks. For a group of 12 the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Apparently my earlier review of Viva Mercado's was associated with their old location on Yelp.  So it's pasted here too.  Cliffs Notes: it's amazing.

--------------------------------

I promise that you will not find better Mexican food in Las Vegas than at Viva Mercado's.  (Though you'll find MANY more expensive and pretentious Mexican places.)

They start you off right with an amazing free bean dip, along with your choice from a list of very good salsas.  They also give you a suprisingly flavorful cup of tomato soup with most entrees.  The entrees I've gotten have all been hot, fresh, delicious, and large.  And the service is great.  If you're visiting Las Vegas, it's worth getting access to a car just so you can eat here."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican restaurants I've found in Las Vegas, but I've yet to find \"the one\". The SERVICE here deserves 5+ stars. What a wonderful staff. The soap de fideo is very good, we've also tried and enjoyed the fried fish tacos and steak chimichanga. Lunch entrees were roughly $10-$14 per person and the kids meal is a little steep at $8.99. But the excellent service makes it worth the $."}
{"text":"Split the 2 person steak fajita meal. Free chips and dip is great. The meat was on the bland side, nothing to special. Portion size was huge. The staff was very attentive- never waiting on anything. Huge menu to choose from."}
{"text":"I am originally from El Paso, TX and am very picky when it comes to mexican food. Ive been coming here since I was a kid when they were on Jones Im 31 now so thats a long time. Anytime I go out of town I am on a search for good mexican food and hardly none ever compare to here. This place is the BEST mexican restaurant in Vegas and my family and I are here probably on a weekly basis. I normally have the combination plate with steak taco and chicken enchilada or the chicken firecrackers which are somewhat like taquitos with jalapeno in them SOOOO GOOD. My husband has had lots of different options like seafood burrito, steak taco, tamales, chicken quesadilla and hes never had a complaint. We also love the complimentary soup with dinner meals and complimentary chips salsa and bean dip they start u off with. I normally also get some of the specialty salsas like habanero and arbol. The sopapillas are very good as well! My kids also love it and ask to come here all the time. The staff is always so friendly and accomodating and are used to seeing us so much. We always make lots of alterations to our meals and they handle it with no problem. I LOVE the new location very clean and modern looking and will continue to come here as long as Im living in Vegas! If u like mexican food as much as I do this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with how authentic this Mexican restaurant serves their food. I had great and friendly service."}
{"text":"5 stars isn't nearly enough, I wish I could leave more. BY FAR the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Value, food quality, and service are all second to none. 
I HATE beans, hate them, but I eat the entire bowl of complimentary bean dip every time I come here, which since discovering, is at least twice a week. I've never been disappointed, I leave every time wondering how I ever lived without this place. The margaritas are awesome! Jose is the coolest/best waiter ever!"}
{"text":"The bowl of salsa that came out had something strange in it (I was thinking a cilantro stem or something) so I fished it out. I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa. The waiter wasn't quite sure how to handle it and couldn't find a supervisor to help him out. With our stomachs turning from the thought of wire or other \"extras\" that may he included we decided it was time to go. I really wanted chips and salsa too."}
{"text":"I wanted to try some Mexican food at a real restaurant with waiter service, so I chose Viva Mercado's.  I was very hungry, and I was ready to wolf down loads of food.

The moment we sat down, tortilla crisps, salsa, bean dip, as well as sauteed jalapeño with onion were served.  The crisps were a little thick, but the salsa and bean dip were delicious.  The sauteed jalapeño was cooked to a perfect texture, but didn't have much flavour, aside from the spiciness itself.

The rice was relatively good, and it was not overcooked.  The tamale I ate was the first I had ever eaten, so I cannot really judge it since I have no other experiences I can compare it to.  However, I thought it had a good texture, and the corn flavour was evident.  The fish taco was sadly mediocre; the fried fish lacked crunch, and the lettuce was a bit soggy.  I was, however, a big fan of the tomatillo sauce on the taco.

The Pollo Ala Parrilla was delicious.  The chicken breast was surprisingly juicy (considering it is chicken breast) and the garlic and citrus flavours were robust.  It was a great piece of chicken.

The Chilaquiles were my favourite.  The moment it was bit into, a hint of a tang of white vinegar (or some other sort of vinegar) hit, and the other flavours followed.  It was a unique, simple, and easy-to-eat dish that I would love as a snack rather than dinner.

The service was fine.  The staff seemed to be following some very firmly established operating procedures, and therefore was efficient (although not necessarily genuine).

I would definitely like to dine here again, for my first experience was very good, and there are so many options on the menu that I am very eager to try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Ordered for pickup and everything was perfectly ready!!! The inside is so fancy and beautiful!!! I ordered fideo soup (which was great!!) , pozole (it was perfect!!) And a side of salsa which came with chips and a yummy side of beans!! Im coming back for dinner!! But this time I will be all dressed up and dine in!! Thank you for a great service!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas for AUTHENTIC  Mexican food. There are many dishes we love such as fajita plate, shredded beef chimichanga,  and my all-time favorite chili Verde pork. It has a nice atmosphere but is sometimes loud. Tonight it was quieter and my chili Verde was fantastic.  My wife loved the chimi. We also think the fideo soup was delicious.  They brought a plate of grilled peppers and onions too. The only beans my wife will eat are theirs."}
{"text":"Food was very good , good atmosphere , good price . All around a solid Mexican food place in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great service great food and surprising comped compliments such as soups and desserts."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here (first time at the new location). The atmosphere and decor are very nice and the restaurant was clean. We were seated right away and immediately had someone bring us chips, salsa and beans. They were good but I prefer Coyote's chips better because they put seasoning salt on theirs. However, everything else was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is so much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. Yummy food, really cute atmosphere. Really good chips, salsa and bean dip. We will be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"So great to see Viva Mercado's is back in action.  The new place in the village square in Summerlin is a perfect location with ample parking, a movie theater close by, and plenty of shopping.  

The restaurant has a great vibe to it with an open dining room split into two sections and a good sized bar separated just enough from the dining area.  The atmosphere is a perfect blend of privacy without feeling too detached from the crowd.  The decor is a good mix of traditional Mexican flare and a modern sophisticated feel. Unlike some other Mexican places I've been the entertainment level of mariachi doesn't overpower the room or your table conversation.

The menu has all the traditional fare that I remember from the old location and the prices for the food are definitely reasonable.  The bar is stocked with plenty of tequila choices and margaritas (I'm partial to the Cadillac with Don Julio on the rocks with salt).

The chips, beans, and salsa they provide to the table hit the spot to start the meal.  The chips are always fresh and the salsa is a tomato based that isn't too chunky and just enough spice. If you are looking for a little starter the guacamole is a good addition to the chips and so is the queso fundido. The fideo soup has a great broth to pasta ratio and comes to the table piping hot.

I'm a big fan of the cheese enchiladas and Chile rellenos because they are expertly crafted, just enough sauce and cheese.  The rellenos batter is delicious.  You can't go wrong with the carnitas or Chile Colorado too.

One of the best parts of the experience is the staff. Even though they just reopened the staff is well trained and ready even when its packed.  Everyone was friendly from the host station to the server.  They all made sure the glasses stayed full and the chips and salsa were never empty, even if they weren't assigned to our table.

Overall kudos to viva for:
1. Reopening (missed you guys)
2. Great location with good layout and decor
3.  Awesome food and reasonable prices
4. Deep bar selection and well crafted cocktails
5. Well trained and super friendly staff

I live in Henderson but will gladly make the drive anytime I need my Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, awesome dining experience from the chips and salsa, to the margaritas, to the entrees. I ordered the carne asada, and it was an one of the best I have ever had. If I could give this place more stars I would."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Family owned and staff is very polite and friendly.  More importantly they remember their customers"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Mexican food and I went here on a whim. I ordered three tacos on corn tortillas. They served chips and salsa with refried bean dip while I waited for my meal. When the tacos came, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the portions were larger than I expected. I was only able to finish two of the tacos. I took the third one home and had it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I'm glad that Viva Mercado's took another shot! My wife and I used to go to the Flamingo/Jones location at least once per month. When they moved to Rainbow/Spring Mountain, it seemed as if the quality of the food and service went downhill. We took our business to competitors like Lindo.    We gave the new location in Village Square a shot and were pleasantly surprised. Chips tasted fresh and entrees were superb. I had the carnitas fajitas and my wife had a carne asada dish. Prices were in line with the quality and portions. I actually felt the value. Thanks Viva Mercado's for not giving up on keeping great Mexican food alive in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great for happy hour special drinks (3 dollar drafts!) with some wonderful appetizers before a movie."}
{"text":"Favorate Place so glad they re-opened!!! and On my side of town!!!  Best Margaritas in town!!!!!!   and food is awsome. favorate ceviche, and tacos de camarones, or diabla... oh and the  rellanos are the best too. never have have a bad meal. Leno is  the best!!!!"}
{"text":"if you like basic Mexican food this is the place to go.
service was slow food was warm and flavor was bland"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place. 

We were greeted right away with smiling faces & guided to a comfortable booth. Atmosphere was festive.

Warm, light & crispy tortilla Chips were served with a red salsa and bean dip. I enjoyed all 3. 

The server lacked enthusiasm but, did his job.

The menu is extensive and I like how it's categorized by seafood, pork and chicken etc...

I chose to build my own combo. I ordered a crispy shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco shell was light & crispy, yum. 

A cup of Fideo soup accompanied my meal. It was very good. 

All in all, I enjoyed everything served. 

Oh...wait! They served us a complimentary dessert. We were very full but, had a bite. Not bad

Not sure if there's a name for it but, if I had to give it one I'd call it Churro Chips"}
{"text":"I travel to Vegas for business regularly, and my favorite stop for Mexican food is Viva Mercardos.  Note that the current address listed here is incorrect.  The food and service is top-notch.  Make sure you get the \"torridos\" with your chips and salsa...both are no-charge.  Their chorizo  burrito is the best I've found...anywhere.  I do wish they would open-up a location in Orange County; but then again, I'd have to buy new (larger) clothes if they did."}
{"text":"Been excited ever since we found out they were re-opening. Didn't think it ead possible but the food and service evrn better.  Still have the full menu of all my favs!"}
{"text":"The best experience I have had in a long time!! Our drinks were never empty, chips and dip were refilled too!! I had the chicken burrito, Chris had the chimichanga, and Elisa the carne asada. Great food! Great service! We will definitely be back!! AND they have menudo everyday!

Carlos was the best ever!!"}
{"text":"My Mom & I had lunch today. I have eaten here before when the food & service was outstanding. I'm not sure if they had a different cook today or what. The food wasn't quite as fresh. Waiter mixed up my plate with another persons. I wasn't happy when he took  my plate off another persons table.  The shredded lettuce & beef was old on my taco. The sauce on my moms meal was from a can. No discount was given for the mix up.  Very hesitant about coning back."}
{"text":"Good food Good Service. I've been coming to Viva Mercado's for 20 years. I've seen them go through multiple locations , changes etc. I feel like they are doing really well after opening their new location a couple years ago. I eat Mexican regularly through out Las Vegas. I've seen competing restaurants do really well and take a down hill Fall  on food quality so to see Viva Mercado's continue to do strive made me glad to see."}
{"text":"So I just realized there was a viva mercados on spring mountain and rainbow and I had only been there once but was sad when they closed and I did not know right away of this location!!  The chips salsa and beans to start were much better than most Mexican restaurants I've been!!  Happy hour is from 3-6 daily so we tried the taquitos they came out hot and fast and looked freshly made and tasted very good the chicken inside was very tasty!!  The guacamole was full of veggies and had lots of flavor!!  We ordered a chicken chimichanga and sante fe enchiladas!!  Both were delicious!!  Packed with fresh veggies!!  The rice was good but nothing to rave about!  The service was great!!  This is a nice restaurant!!  The decor is very nice inside!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! ... Maybe with the exception of how sweet my margarita was..  But everything was delicious! Javier, our server/bartender was great. We had magaritas and tequila sips. We enjoyed our meal. My boyfriend had the enchiladas and I had a taco and flauta. I can tell you that I enjoyed my meal as much as I did, if not more, in Mexico.  Cooked to perfection and our complimentary dessert was what was needed.   I read the yelp reviews that helped me pick this place and it definitely didn't disappoint. We did however end up spending close to $100 for 2 people  but that was after two meals, 2 magaritas, 2 Mexican coffees with alcohol, 2 shots of premium tequila and soup. That was the beat part of all!!!! We enjoyed it and can't wait to come back with friends."}
{"text":"This is an overture review for Viva Mercado. We went there for my husbands birthday in March wth a large party. We ordered and ate and the food was pretty good....BUT, the server came over and insisted we pay cash! They said their credit card machine was \" down\" and suggested we use their fee atm on premises. This seemed very fishy given that the place was full and no mention was made as we (or anyone else) arrived that cash was required. It would have been nice if we had been advised BEFORE we ordered that cash was needed. obviously after we ate it was very inconvenient to be asked for cash, given most people do not carry hundreds of dollars unless they are strippers or drug dealers. So, perhaps this was some sort of an effort to boost their atm fee revenue. When my husband questioned the manager, the very large cook came out of the back as a show of force. Their food is pretty good...but I won't go back. An apology would have been nice or perhaps a free desert??? Oh well."}
{"text":"Whenever we happen to be in the neighborhood, there's a couple of places we've tried, and ended up liking a lot. Viva Mercado's is indeed one of them, but it was our second (third, maybe?) visit that prompted me to buckle down and write a review.

First, this is only one of TWO places in town we've been to that obviously make their chips and salsa in-house; an important detail of authentic Latin cuisine that never goes unappreciated.  And the PORTIONS...AY, DIOS MIO! I ordered a very generous Taco Salad with Grilled Chicken and a Quesadilla with Carnitas added, and by the time I got halfway through the salad, I was STUFFED...no entree or desserts needed! Well, not quite true...I counted my second Banana Margarita as my 'dessert'!

So one of the things to keep in mind when you come here is to bring an OUTRAGEOUS appetite to match those more-than-worth-your-dinero portions.  They may have to roll you out in a wheelbarrow when you finish...but the flavorful, freshly-made food will have been worth it!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas! Exceptional service! They make you feel welcomed. Love this place. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Poor service and average cuisine. I've had much cheaper Mexican cuisine that was much more flavorful, enticing and magical. Cheese enchilada wasn't anything to dance over, and Mom wasn't wowed by her order of a chicken enchilada combo either. She too has eaten a vast array of Mexican food and was not at all impressed with this experience. We've had much cheaper and much heartier, with far more attentive service. In both Nevada and California.

Waiter vanished shortly after we were seated and caught us right before we were about to walk out, but we were disappointed in being left alone far too long. Mom tipped. I wouldn't have. While the food was just okay, the service was the fatal flaw."}
{"text":"Took a chance and glad we did! Food and service were great! All of the servers were extremely attentive and on their game. Food was delicious and came out exactly as ordered. Location was a little hard to find since we were searching for a stand alone restaurant, but once we found it we were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side, but the food is really good and the fried churro things at the end are bomb diggity."}
{"text":"Awesome Food, great service on top of that. Get there early... they get busy! I have had fajitas and my wife- chimichungas, but everything looks amazing. I recommend it highly if you're looking for authentic mexican. Prices are reasonable, and the margaritas are excellent. Corona Lite on tap too !"}
{"text":"I think of this place in terms of 2 out of 5 stars, but the shrimp ceviche is so dang delicious that I bumped it up to 3.

The restaurant is nice inside.  It's clean, well-decorated, nicely lit, and the layout is nice.  It's not huge, it's not tiny, it's just right.

The service is fine. The wait times are average and the people are nice enough.  I don't think anyone goes out of their way, but the good thing is you don't see people hanging about, chit-chatting either.

The food.  Everything (with the exception of the shrimp ceviche) is just ok.  It's not awful, it's not amazing, it's just ok.  This includes the chips, salsa, meals, desserts, etc.  We haven't tried anything there that has been enough to make us say anything other than, \"it's ok.\"  My husband is kind enough to keep trying because he knows how much I love the shrimp ceviche.  

In my opinion, there are too many items on the menu.  It's way too overloaded with options.  Maybe if they trimmed back their offerings, perhaps they could concentrate on the food itself and take it to another level.   I think they are spread too thin.

The prices are high for what you get.  I think that the prices are too out of whack for the level of service, food quality, and atmosphere.  I think little things would be forgiven more easily if the pricing was more in-line with typical expectations.  

Take out.  I recently had the bright idea of getting the shrimp ceviche as a take out item.  I was disappointed to see that the portion is significantly smaller than what is provided during dine in, and that the price is the same.  I had to beg to get some extra tortilla chips, and even then they told me that they \"should charge me.\"  That really rubbed me the wrong way.  Don't act like you're doing me a favor by short-changing my order, and then saving me $2 for extra chips.  

To the owner:  I appreciate that you take the time to read the reviews and respond to the less favorable ones.  I am hoping that you will actually take my recommendations and thoughts into consideration, rather than just dismissing them or \"checking into\" things.  I am truly writing this review because I want your restaurant to succeed this time around.  Besides, I'd go crazy without my shrimp ceviche fix!"}
{"text":"Very friendly hosts and service staff. They made us feel very welcome. The restaurant has lots of room so the tables are nicely placed so that you're not dining on top of your neighbors. The food was hot and tasty. The amount of meat in the fajitas was somewhat overwhelmed by the large amount of onions, so the first impression was that there wasn't very much meat, but the meal as a whole was so enjoyable that first impression quickly disappeared."}
{"text":"Food was good but they have signs in front of the restaurant, which I took pictures, stating a discount for seniors and military. However when we asked for a discount cause we had both qualifications and identification, we were denied. The waitress stated that a discount was not available for lunch. NOWHERE on the 3 posted signs did it state lunch not included.
Received no compensation, no explanation.
If you are going to post a sign, HONOR IT!
Poor customer 

I am very sorry, this is not the restaurant we visited. Please excuse my mistake"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service! If you love Mexican food, then come try it out. It's worth the drive from the strip."}
{"text":"Just doesn't get better than viva mercados. Best service, great ambiance, and amazing food."}
{"text":"Hallelujah!, they're back & better than before. It's taken me too long to finally visit Viva Mercado at their new location. We were pretty taken aback walking in: huge, bold, warm, pristine. Everyone was incredibly lovely, from the host to our waiter. Chips: yum. Salsa: yum. Water: strangely, also yum. We've been encountering taste issues, in the past couple months, with guacamoles but Viva Mercado did not disappoint! Be warned: they provide a plate of sauteed onion & peppers. I thought they were green pepper & popped a big ol' piece in my mouth... after seeing my life flash before my eyes, I realized they were actually jalapenos! I wasn't terribly hungry so I ordered a bowl of fideo & it was not only the best fideo I've had, it was one of my favorite soups! My partner in crime agreed, once having her pre-entree cup of it. She got the verde carne asada enchiladas & was very satisfied (& able to take half home). We'll definitely be back soon & frequently! Felt like the perfect place for cozy winter meals."}
{"text":"best mexican food in vegas I love this place and i love the new location with the decor food is excellent and service was great can't wait to come back i had the cheese enchiladas and husband had carne asada and pollo asada soft tacos. bean dip is great and food is very flavorful"}

{"text":"The food is quality here!  I can't truly complain about much.  I don't think the breakfast steak served as carne asada on the lunch menu is appealing but it did taste decent, just not big enough.  The mulitas are awesome!!!  Great chips and salsa and the ambiance is great.  I am not a fan of the tapatio being served in packets.  Just one persons humble opinion.  We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. We are new in town and Yelp-ed to find a good Mexican food restaurant. Yelp did not disappoint!! They have a great happy hour menu and very cheap prices. 3 people w/ appetizer, individual plates and drinks was $26 for the happy hour menu!! The street tacos are pretty good size! very filling."}
{"text":"Have not eaten at Viva since it moved locations long ago and shame on me as it was a fantastic experience. Food was authentic and portions are very generous. Ignacio was our server and was very attentive, friendly and completed our overall experience. Ambiance makes you feel like you are not in Vegas anymore. A definite recommendation for anyone looking for a great meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"Ordered Carne asada, I feel so sick afterwards and stayed up all night with a stomach ache with work early in the morning. Same goes for my husband too... never coming back."}
{"text":"Our Favorite Mexican restaurant by a long shot!!  The staff are wonderful and so friendly and helpful.  The food is always delicious and the servings are very  generous!"}
{"text":"Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen, so I'm not usually looking forward to eating Mexican food, but a friend had recommended Viva Mercado and it worked out Saturday night that we could head over there while in Vegas for the weekend.  I AM SO GLAD WE DID!  

It was Saturday and there were a few parties ahead of us so the wait was to be about 30 minutes.  The place was packed.  Luckily, about 20 minutes in, a man asked if we'd like to sit at a bar table.  Why, yes I would!  So we headed into the bar area and I'm glad we did.  My biggest disappointment is I threw away my receipt somehow between yesterday and today and I cannot remember our server's name.  This is important because our service was outstanding.  Between our main server and the bussers assisting him, I felt like I was in a fancy five star restaurant.  My iced tea was kept full at all times, chips and accompaniments were kept full and empty dishes whisked away.  When we first sat down our server brought us chips and salsa and a small bowl of beans - I don't eat them, but my husband was loving beans to dip his chips in!  Then he asked if we like spicy food, we said we did.  he brought out a plate of freshly roasted jalapenos on a bed of grilled onions.  WHAT?  This never happens!  They were tasty and while spicy not too hot for me!

The menu is HUGE (too big!!!) but I finally narrowed it down to the tomatillo carnitas enchiladas.  I asked for my beans on the side so the husband could have them and they brought a massive plate of beans \"on the side\"!  My husband ordered steak machaca and eggs.  Both dishes ordered were a great size and along with all the chips and salsa, there was NO WAY we could eat it all.  I had mentioned to the husband that I thought it looked a little pricey for mexican food, but for what you get, it's an awesome deal.  We weren't drinking, so we only paid for our food and for both meals came out to about $34 before tip.  Oh, after we had boxed up half of our food to take home for breakfast, our waiter brought us crispy tortillas with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream to finish up with!

I know this sounds crazy, but this was one of the finest dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas and I'm there a lot and I like to eat good food.  I cannot imagine how there are negative reviews for Viva Mercado, because my experience was top notch.

The final kicker, I ate my leftovers for breakfast, MICROWAVED.  I'm a food snob and picky and I never eat leftovers unless it's like pasta or something simple, but this enchilada was so damned good, I wished I'd had more of them the next day.  Oh, we WILL be back. You should go there."}
{"text":"Love the delicious food, happy hour, fragrances. Yummy I'm not a fan of Mexican food usually but I just love this place. Save your appetite though it's a lot of food. Excellent wait staff so gracious, kind , you feel like they are the owners. Love love love it"}
{"text":"Probably the best salsa in town huge salsa and Chip portions while you're drinking your beer I cannot stress enough how delicious that's salsa is .. and it's a very affordable restaurant super nice people"}
{"text":"Have gone to this place three times now and have yet to be disappointed! The service is what makes this place so exceptional. Every visit I have been greeted with smiles and the waiters are fast and polite. I highly recommend the tamale it is a personal favorite (that is if you don't get to full eating all the yummy chips,salsa,and beans brought to the table as soon as you sit!) Best Mexican food I have eaten so far in the Summerlin area"}
{"text":"The service is great here. They really do check on you and make sure everything is good. The reason I gave it 2 stars though is because the food taste also has to be good in my opinion. The food was pretty bad. I had a chimichanga and I felt like it was so lemony I had to force every bite down. I never ever write reviews this is my first but the burrito was so bad I had to write one. I felt like throwing up the burrito towards the end. Service is great but the food is terrible."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place ! Food was on point and they weren't cheap on there alcohol. Highly recommend the Cadillac Margarita you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Viva Mercado for years, first in Henderson and now on Sahara.  The food & service always are excellent.  Today I ordered a Cheese Crisp with shredded beef. Yummy!  My husband had a combination of taco, enchilada, chili relleno, his usual. Also excellent.  We highly Viva Mercado. You will love it."}
{"text":"Losing it's luster! The food is always on point. Tonight's issue is that service was lacking of any attention to detail! Come on folks, the place was empty at5pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food, but service is very slow.  Took forever to get water and soup that comes with meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was very good. I wondered if in the kitchen were a bunch of abuelitas cooking."}
{"text":"Their taco salad is my fave....and I like a little soup before my meal. Viva Mercado is darn good!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in my last dining experience with them. My boyfriend and I come here quite often and our last dinner experience was horrible. The server was RIDICULOUS.  We came an hour before they closed & the server was MIA. Finally after a while he took our order and once we got our food he never once came to check on us. In fact there was no one on the floor but the bartender. I had to grab a busser to get our check. Definitely not coming back since they obviously don't appreciate their guest."}
{"text":"I went to Viva Mercado's during my lunch break. I was seated near the bar and kitchen entrance and the waitstaff quickly came by to take my order and brought complimentary chips, salsa and refried beans. I ordered one of their lunch combos with a carne asada taco and a grilled fish taco. My first thought when I bit into the carne asada taco was, \"THAT'S how asada should be.\" A nicely-seared beef with a flavorful marinade. The fish taco was sitting on some pico de gallo so the tortilla got quite soggy. It paled in comparison to the carne asada. 

The food was affordable and my server, even though seemed pretty busy, was friendly and attentive. This location used to be occupied by some other sad Mexican restaurant that failed. I'm glad Viva Mercado's took over and hope for their continued success."}
{"text":"My husband and I were ecstatic (no understatement) when we found they'd reopened!  I feel like we're coming home when we're greeted with a smile, handshake, and a heartfelt \"welcome back!\".  The service is great and the food is even better than before!  No other Mexican restaurant can compare to my experience at Viva Mercados."}
{"text":"Legit! That's all you need to know. This installation is in very laid back neighborhood, some out door seating, perfect for dinner with a margarita, any day. I had combination dinner with chicken burrito and beef flautas. I was so full. Our company ordered a dish with shrimp and poblano in cream sauce, can't remember the name of the dish, but it was Awesome!! Their margarita was okay. Not enough kick for me. Honestly, I liked presidente from Chili's better :P"}
{"text":"This is by far the best  Authentic Mexican Food in the Las Vegas Area!
Great Place! Great Staff! Great Food!  Now open one in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at Viva Mercado's last night with something we never had before.... Seafood Taquitos.  Everything from the Fajitas to the Chimichanga to the Enchiladas were great portions and delicious.  The onlything better was the exceptional service by our waiter Jose and his busboy!"}
{"text":"Contracted food poisoning Sunday night. Waiter said there were problems in the kitchen. Half of the kitchen was broken whatever that means. I ordered beef taquitos in the bar. Took 45 minutes to get. I would be careful here. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant with my boyfriend twice now. And we love it! The food, staff, and atmosphere is GREAT! 

We've been seated quickly (once at the bar during happy hour!) and taken care of both times. Both times we've had Joey as our server/bartender (I think that's his name. I'm bad with names!) and he is FANTASTIC! 

The prices are reasonable too, which is a plus for a budget Betty like myself! 

The first time I visited I ordered the chicken enchiladas. And the second time I ordered their \"street tacos\"! I recommend both!! So yummy and their strawberry daiquiris are pretty good too. (:"}
{"text":"The food was great. The atmosphere was perfect. The staff are friendly. We had lunch there while at the Red Rock casino. It was so good we went back a week later and drove a ways to get back there. I had the Carne asada burrito and steak fajitas. Both were awesome."}
{"text":"This Restaurant doesnt serve fresh food!! 1. Canned Rice 2. Factory processed Guacamole 3. Tortilla chips and Tortillas from a BAG!! Its so obvious. Marguerites tasted like they were poured from a pool party like rental machine...The mole/ Green sauce was inedible... Save your Money and go to Michocan or Robertos!!"}
{"text":"Family and I dined here quite a few times and we've had nothin but great service and food!  I highly recommend this Mexican restaurant. Their beans and dip are to die for!"}
{"text":"We were lucky to arrive during happy hour for outstanding value/quantity.  Ordered off regular menu too...fair prices.  (The limited HH menu and drink selection were still sufficient and full-quality.)  Authentic taste, quality, attentive service.  Really had no problem adding some extra \"heat\" to the food!!  ....and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Grew up going here at their old location. When I recently visited home, I had to check their new place out!  It was still so good, and the food was even better than I remember. They also still serve the noodle soup, which is my favorite part. The new location is nice too.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"I just received my food from yelp delivery. Everything was really good. I got the chile relleno burrito, it came with a side of beans,rice, salad and they also sent me a bag with chips, salsa and beans. Everything was really good, when I paid I thought it was a little expensive $25 after the fee and 1 coffee for lunch, well I am satisfied and I have enough left overs for dinner and probably lunch for tomorrow with all the sides and portions I got. Thank you I will be ordering again and if i'm in the area I will  stop to eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Heat authentic Mexican food. Prices are reasonable and the outdoor patio should be perfect this summer. The tacos are too die for!"}
{"text":"Really great staff had so much fun here. Food was all great, mostly based off our servers recommendations too. The happy hour drinks were great and affordable ($4 sangria) . Someone sent over a free plate of dessert I'm guessing the manager :) above and beyond guys thank you!"}
{"text":"Ok second night in a row here.  They start with a  bean dip salsa chips.   If you get a dinner comes with a wonderful soup.  Prices are good if you are a light eater. Menu has 9 items under $6.00.   Otherwise can be a tad expensive.  Played big enough to share.  And yes folks it is diet coke.  

Service is quick and with a smile. 

Almost forgot. Free dessert also."}
{"text":"I will keep it short and sweet without all the details of my horrible experience there for a friend's birthday. The food is mediocre at best, the service is for the most part friendly but incredibly slow, and even with a reservation it was a good two hours before we were served our meals. Save yourself the waste of money and head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutley love this place, I have been coming here since it was a small \"hole in the wall\" on Flamingo Rd. now they are about 22/23 miles away from me but that does not stop me from driving across town to come & indulge in some real authentic mexican food. I am Mexican and I know what real authentic mexican food is suppose to taste like & this place hits home all the time, I have had just about everything on the menu and could not say one bad thing about anything on it, all is delicious and full of flavor.

Service is amazing, love walking into a place w/cheerful and upbeat smiling faces."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Viva Mercado's for years and the food is consistently wonderful. The staff are all very friendly and very courteous.  There are very few restaurants in this city that deliver with the same consistency year after year.

Their restaurant is very clean and very charming."}
{"text":"I simply cannot believe we have passed this place by for the past 2 years we have been in Peccole Ranch.  To be fair, there are a bunch of nearby first class restaurants in this shopping center, but these guys just moved into a tie (with El Dorado Cantina) for my go-to spot for quality Mexican food.  (Note: we have returned twice since our first visit 5 weeks ago)
  Lets start with the decor and ambiance.  I usually don't comment on this, but the place is well lit, airy, colorful and clean as a pin.
This was a Sunday and the restaurant was about a third full.  Service was prompt and on point.  We has an assistant refilling drinks and also offering more complimentary chips as soon an the glasses/plate was close to empty. There are three choices of salsa, to suit your desire for more/less heat.
  Not much to say about the food, except that we have ordered perhaps 10 different menu choices and have never been disappointed.  Best value, IMHO is the barbecoa beef burrito.
  We turned down dessert our first visit, but our waiter would have none of that and brought us a complimentary plate of flour chips with dusted sugar and cinnamon, with drizzled honey and chocolate along with the bill.  Don't know the exact name for this, but you get the idea.  Definitely returning..."}
{"text":"Stopped for a few drinks and appetizer before the movies. Ordered a steak and chicken quesadilla with no pico or onions. Allergies. Ran out of time so asked for the quesadilla to go. After the movie got home, heated up the quesadilla and took a bite. Filled with pico and onions. Called and asked for a refund. Was given back less than the cost of the quesadilla with tax and tip. Ridiculous customer service especially when dealing with neglect and a health issue."}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to find a good restaurant. I came with my wife yesterday I order the most simple thing in the menu \"burrito\"  how can a Mexican restaurant mess a burrito I have no idea but ViVa mercado did, the carne asada was burn it was just bad. Just skip this place and go to Roberto

Update. Reply to mercado

If I don't like the food i just pay and leave and never come back. I'm not the kind of person to complaint to the server. That's how we Latinos do it."}
{"text":"So nice to find a gem in this area! We are from southern Cali... so amazing Mexican food. This place has great chips and salsa, and they bring bean dip too! And Fideo! Freeeeee! We both got the organic margarita... also great. Shrimp/steak fajitas were fresh and they were the good size shrimp.  Also ordered vegetarian tamale and cheese enchilada. Potato in the tamale was a little weird, but the food is super fresh.  I also don't want to discount good service, our waiter was good and the bus staff even better. Dinner for 2 with 2 drinks, $65... without tip. Oh, and dessert is free too :)"}
{"text":"We frequent the Village Square area pretty often. So when some friends of ours invited us out to Viva Mercado's, which happened to be one of my bookmarks, I couldn't turn it down. Sadly, the quality fell way short of what I expected after reading so many great reviews.

The restaurant itself, which sits in the farther SW corner of the center, is actually quite nice. It's a bit smaller than I expected just judging from the view outside, but there's still a decent amount of seating. On top of the bar and dining area inside, they also have a really cool patio area outside. Alongside a few tables, they have a neat family style, bar height fire-pit type thing that looks to seat about 10+. Since our visit was on a chillier night, we decided to sit inside, but if I were to return and the weather was nice, I'd request those seats. And for what it's worth, our party of 6 arrived just after 6pm on a Friday and got seated within 15 minutes. 

Much like similar restaurants, Viva Mercado's has a pretty extensive menu. Several pages offer everything from appetizers to combo plates. They also have one of the biggest seafood selections I've seen from similar style restaurants, which I now wish I had ordered from. I ended up going with the Mulitas, which they serve basically like a big open face taco. They offer it with several types of meats, and I opted for the carnitas. Quality wise, I'd say they're just about a notch above Macayo's, which really isn't saying much. The meat was dry, the tortillas were stale and there was so much sour cream on top of it, that I could barely taste anything else. After picking through it, there was little flavor to anything else on the plate anyway. I'm also not a huge fan of the rice and beans they have, which just seems like those cheap heat and serve sides. The highlight of our meal was the complimentary chips, served with a side a fried jalapeños and onions. I ended up eating more of those than my meal.   

For the most part, our service wasn't terrible, but it could definitely use some work. I ordered an iced tea that was obviously old and had been brewed a while back, so I just ordered a water on top of it that I planned to drink, but I never got it. That was a slight mishap and easy to overlook, but the biggest problem was with one of our friends who had a huge headache with his meal. He ordered a combo meal, which normally comes with rice and beans, but he requested no beans and double rice. When his plate came out, they gave him the rice and beans like it's normally served. He immediately told them that it was incorrect, so they took the plate back, but then brought out double beans and no rice. After having to tell them 3 times and sending his plate back twice, they still couldn't get it right and just ended up bring him a side plate of rice. Something so simple just turned into a huge ordeal. 

Overall, if you're a fan of restaurants like Macayo's then you will probably like Viva Mercado's. But I am not, and Macayo's is actually one of my least favorite restaurants. So with food that is barely a step above that, and service that is lacking, I can't say I'll be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Viva Mercados since they were a tiny hole in the wall on Jones. We absolutely love the barbacoa and usually don't deviate from deliciousness!  9 years ago we moved to Henderson but make the 45 minute trek across town as it is so worth the drive. Take out of town visitors there whenever we can."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We were seated quickly, orders taken and food came out in good time too.  The chips were good and the salsa and beans that went with it were delicious. Everything was fresh and hot and tasty. Our server was nice and friendly. Everything was very flavorful. We've been debating trying this place for a while and glad we did. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas !! We are from Texas and they have many items on the menu that remind us of the Tex-Mex flavor !!! Wait staff has always been friendly and helpful with question about the menu... 
So glad we discovered Viva Mercado's"}
{"text":"Place is pretty dang decent!! The chips and salsa was good, the service was great.we got the chicken nachos and a cheese enchilada and we both left stuffed and happy. The sign says max capacity 211, their must be more seating in the back because looking where we we seating I don't see it. Would like to try their cocktails when I'm not on call, I'll update the review of their drinks when I do"}
{"text":"Thank you for your response. I appreciate your desire to defend your staff's actions however it is illogical to think that we were not specific as to what was wrong with the order. We only asked for that item to be refunded if the missing pieces were not able to be delivered. Not only was an apology never given (a common courtesy) but Stephanie accused the driver of \"stealing\" it. What could have been a simple \"sorry\" and a continued loyal customer has now turned into lost business and bad press due to you and your staffs unwillingness to treat your patrons with respect and graciousness for years of patronage. As a Las Vegas native- I and my family have been loyal back to the old location days and am saddened that that $15 was more important than a forever customer."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in town. The food is always consistently wonderful and the service is just as good. My favorite is the ceviche de cameron and my husband loves to switch it up every time we're there. He's never disappointed. My son loves the fideo and the chips and salsa. A must try place if you're looking for good food. Try a michelada with Dos Equis amber and order a side of tomatillo salsa! They're both to die for! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Service is Excellent here. Food is OK if you like spicy food. The portions are not large, but they are generous on the chips and dips."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant, the service is always great! The servers and staff pay attention to detail and are always attentive. The decor is gorgeous, the staff is nice and the food is awesome. Every time we've been there we've received great service and great food. The manager Bobby, always asks how everything was every time we visit. Hands down, my favorite restaurant! Thank you and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Tuesday. I was very impressed with  the decor as soon as I walked in. The service was outstanding to say the least.  Then there was the food. I had the chili verdi.  It was awsome, or as we would say where  I grew up, wicked pissa.  This is one place  I will frequent again. And,I will be sure to pass the word on to my friends"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious margaritas!!!! Get the PLAIN FROZEN  one. Did I say it's delicious?  It's hard to find margaritas that aren't to sweet or to sour but this was perfect. The secret is they put the right amount of alcohol in it. The alcohol balances out the sweetness and sourness of the drink.... any drink for that matter! We were greeted so nicely by the reception desk who also walked around to the tables to see how people's meals were. I found our server Sergio super friendly, knowledgeable  and visited our table always at the right time. The complimentary  chips, salsa, bean dip were delicious, they also brought a plate of sweet grilled onions and peppers. 
I ordered Carne Asada medium. The steak was very flavorful. I usually don't eat the refried beans but these were tasty and ate most of it, loved the rice and liked they had a mini salad with guacamole on the plate too. By the way I find guacamole flavorless and don't eat it but this guacamole had flavor and I ate it all! The Flan was good too especially loved the fresh whipped cream. When we were leaving the super friendly reception again acknowledged us and asked us how everything was and wished us a great day. I live in the southern part of county and wish they were closer to me but had this bookmarked in Yelp til I could get here and will return when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was even better.  They have this Mulito dish that is really good.  Their kids menu is great and so are their cocktails.   This is our new spot for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been going to Viva Mercado since I was a kid (I'm 34 now). With that said even if it's your first time the owner Bobby Mercado (who works 24/7) will treat you like a long lost family member. The food is always great but it's the service that makes it even better.  In a city with an abundance of Mexican restaurants what makes Viva Mercado stand out is there quality of food, attention to your needs and how they genuinely care about your experience. Take a chance on Viva Mercado, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's 4:30pm on a Sunday, and Sis and I were absolutely starving. Hanger had struck, and we were bickering over whether or not In 'N Out would be filling enough when our Mimi suggested we try the Mexican place near her house. Sis and I both like Mexican food, so this was an acceptable solution. 

And we were met with all the food we could possibly want! The prices seemed steep at first, but we received plenty of your standard chips and salsa (but with delicious bean dip to boot!), tomato soup, generous portions of our meals, and a lovely sopapilla concoction with whipped cream and chocolate and caramel sauces. Mimi and I ordered the shrimp tacos while Sis ordered the steak fajitas. Yes, there was the hanger factor, but we devoured our meals and loved every bite. 

Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive to beverages, chips, and the overall state of the table. It was fairly quiet on an early Sunday evening, so any less attention would have been bordered on unacceptable. 

A+, would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went for first time today.  
Was a very good experience.
While it is true I have had better refried beans, the fish taco and carnita taco I had on the combination plate were great. Lots of food and good fresh food.
Service was quick and friendly.
I am definitely putting this place on a have to go at least once a month basis."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice atmosphere. The food is really great and we received excellent service. The place is nicely decorated and good margaritas."}
{"text":"So good!

Really, everything here was just so darn delicious, I can't wait to go back. I think the only thing I have seen done 'better' elsewhere is some restaurants have homemade chips, but this is such a trivial thing that is doesn't affect my review at all. The complimentary salsa was wonderfully flavorful and the bean dip was the best I ever had. (I never really understood why beans were served with the chips - who ate that stuff? - until I ate here, and then I couldn't stop eating it!) While we were looking at the menu (the lunch menu), I noticed there was a choice of a complimentary sample of either salsas or toriados. The toriados was described on the menu as fried jalapenos, which didn't sound great, so we decided to ask for the salsas. But when the waiter came by, he automatically brought the toriadoes. When we told him we actually wanted to try the salsas instead, he said no problem, and brought us those as well. Winner! The toriados (which turns out to be both onions & jalapenos sauteed) were phenomenal, tender, delicious, (seriously might be the best sauteed onions ever) and the salsas were great fun to try, with different levels of spiciness, and all with their own flavors behind the heat.

I ordered a combination plate with a chile verde (pork) enchilada, a chile relleno, and a chicken tamale. I was a little surprised that the pork was in chunks instead of shredded, but no worries, it was so tender it didn't matter. Delicious. I actually haven't had a chile relleno before, so I can't really compare it to others. It wasn't my thing - I guess I am not a fan of the breading. But it was still pretty good. And I immensely enjoyed the tamale. It did not have cheese in it, which might disappoint some people, but this made it perfect for me. My husband ordered steak fajitas, and he said they were phenomenal.

We did also order two rounds of margaritas, rocks, no salt. I know some reviewers thought they were too strong or tasted like pure tequila, but we loved them. The first round was perfectly mixed, but as it was made with standard tequila, it was a little sharp (as expected). We had the second round made with one of the premium tequilas, and it was divine.

The service was great, and I enjoyed the decor. I liked the bits of hand-painted vines on the walls, and the artwork for each booth. I had been wanting to try Viva Mercados for a long time because of the great reviews, and I am only disappointed that I didn't eat here sooner. Like I said before: so good!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed here. Solid menu, large portions and excellent service. Our server this evening, Luis R was charming and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm visiting family here in NV and asked for a recommendation for some good Mexican food. First place I was given was this place and was definitely satisfied. Service was amazing from the second we walked into the restaurant.  Food was great!!! I can't wait to come back and eat here again!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place. We are big fans of Casa Don Juan's but we're always up to try a new place. 
It's a good quality restaurant but not our favorite Mexican place in town. The margaritas were good. It's looks like it would be a great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food, everyone at my table enjoyed their dish, the service is also excellent. Manuel is one of the best waiters there, he treated us like family , will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"Really good food for not a bad price. Service was good at the beginning but then slow with the check. Overall a good experience. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food .
They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ...
The food was delivered extremely fast on 12 miles from the restaurant !
Definitely will   Order again !!
Thanks Viva Mercado's"}
{"text":"Great experience at Viva Mercado's in Village Square, mainly due to our waiter.  The little extras really wowed us!  In addition to the beans & salsa dips, he brought us a plate of golden, sautéed onions with jalapeños.  After our meal, we were given a dessert of tortilla-churro-style drizzled with caramel.  He made us feel really special!  Our food was very good and plentiful, with lots of leftovers for today's lunch - yay!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. 

This is your average Americanized Mexican place that is lacking in depth of flavor and quality but still likes to charge for it. The salsa is just meh and did not have any spice, the dishes we got were just ok and way way overpriced for the quality.  I even asked for spicy sauce with my tacos and I did not even have a lick of spice let alone flavor.  I could have made something better at home. 

The service was ok but the waiters act like they get extra commission for the more liquor they sell.  The table next to us was ordering margaritas and our server was milking them like a cow and he barely even asked if we were ok until we were done with our meal.  

I felt like I had a ton of bricks in my gut after eating here and felt blah just like the meal.  They also don't take American Express. Will not be going back that is for sure.  

If you want authentic Mexican food with lots of depth of flavor and spice, please visit Leticia's Mexican Cocina.  It is waaaay better for the same price. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant, but it has seriously gone downhill since Bobby Mercado moved away. The portion sizes have shrunk, so the value has lessened greatly. This used to be the place we always brought our out-of-town guests, but no more. To top it off, I got a nasty case of food poisoning on Monday night 6/18, and I will never go back. It makes me very sad to write this, because I honestly used to adore this place."}
{"text":"You know what sucks? when the bus boys are better than your server :(

Came here last night off the suggestion of yelp (so I blame all you 5 star-ers) and was hoping for some half decent Mexican food in Summerlin (yes my expectations were already simmering low).

I ordered pibil which I do not eat often so when it arrived I was half wondering if I got the right thing. I powered through the meal, dry pork loin (which is the worst) and my mom got chicken fajitas. Her's came as a burrito because the menu is so confusing she thought she ordered a sizzling fajita but it was chicken cooked fajita style in a burrito ( who comes up with such sadistic things?)

I wrangled a menu and realized the server gave me the item above pibil, fine, honest mistake, they took almost $9 off of a $18.99 meal (yes that's up there and for $19, I would have expected my mistake food to have tasted good too). I tipped them back the $9 and we left.

Then today I found out they gave my mom PORK or who knows what meat. 2 wrong orders in 1 party is not acceptable. I would not have tipped and been so understanding if my mom would have told me. UUUUUgh why did she have to wait until I tried it first to let me know (the mom paradox) Anywho the bus boys were amazing and came to our table waaaay more than our server and I'm glad I found out now about the second mix up because I would still be there screaming about a $50 ++ meal where the only things right were the bean dip and chips."}
{"text":"Viva Mercado's is an upscale Mexican restaurant that places incredible value on customer service and satisfaction, while also providing high quality food that pleases every time. I frequent Viva every few months and always leave with a smile on my face. Their menu is extensive and sometimes overwhelming, yet never disappoints. I have tried almost all of the Platillos De Pollo and I always seems to be finding my \"new favorite\".  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and encourage all to try it out when in the mood for a night out in style and comfort."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, specially Mole Chicken. I'm glad that I had a Mexican guy that recommended me this restaurant because we really enjoyed! It's really delicious and enough food, perhaps you may share a plate. I had mine for dinner and I saved half of it for the next lunch."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints; Neither does the service!

We didn't have Luis as our server this time, but he saw us, recognized us, and said hi!
Definitely a testament to the awesome server he truly is!

My husband gets the carne asada each and every time we come here.
I have branched out to other things on other visits, but I usually stick to my favorite: seafood chile rellano, as well. It is impeccable!

Well done, Viva Mercado.
We are regulars and we love this place."}
{"text":"I've comed to this restaurant multiple times and although everyone's always nice, this last time I went customer service and food was horrible. I orders a pozole bowl the bowl was literally a meat bowl with only 8 garbanzo beans on it , yes I counted them! My sister order green enchiladas and she got red enchiladas. We waited for long periods of times before our serves ever came around. This hole experience left me feeling like Never going back again EVER!"}
{"text":"Pro tip- go during lunch, is just as much food and half the price.
This my go to place for somewhat upscale Mexican food.  The menu is like eight full pages long and you could go for years and never order everything.
Go hungry, the portions are huge and I mean huge
Its $15-20 per plate on the dinner menu, a bit pricey, but still a lot cheaper than the strip.
My favorites
Texas Enchiladas
Beef Fajitas.
Shrimp Burrito

The warm bean dip, soup, peppers/onions and desert chip are a great touch.
Go here"}
{"text":"Their fajitas are the best in town. We asked them for a little extra sear aka well done. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We weren't sure about going here because it looked small and dark, but decided to walk inside and check it out. It was pretty big inside and the atmosphere was fun and fantastic. Our waiter looked like Pancho Villa and was great. The margarita was delicious. The food was great. We ordered the Asada salad and the Asada plate. Service here is fast and professional. We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and found them by accident.  It was the best find!!!  We will now go here every time we are in Vegas.  We are telling everyone we know about this place.  Their STUFFED RELLENOS are to die for.  DELICIOUS..  We have family in Vegas and we took them and now they are going to be taking their family too. Everyone working their was fabulous!   Alfredo was so sweet and a very good waiter.
The owner, Bobby was very very nice.  Everyone was super nice.  We have found a new best restaurant.  Now we are home and dying for a stuffed chili relleno and cannot find a restaurant that makes them.   Viva Mercado would make a killing in San Bernardino!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The frozen margaritas were excellent and strong. Everyone was very friendly to our big family of small kids. We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"What is with all my 2 stars reviews lately. Why is everything eh, I've had better. Well, this place definitely falls into that category. Came here for lunch with the lovely Lee L. We were discussing fajita's and this is the place we decided on. I was not impressed. Nothing about it stood out. The decor wasn't very Mexicany. Nothing inspiring. The menu was Ok, but man alive, I thought it was pricey. $8.95 for ONE TACO. You dont need glasses, you read correct eight dollars and ninety five cents for ONE TACO. The waiter insisted it's because it comes with rice and beans. (They must be magic beans!). I'd drive way across town to Taco y Taco for some damn delicious tacos' @ $2.19 each. (I could get 3 and have change to put in the gas tank!) Since I am apparently no longer a vegetarian, I went with the steak fajitas' for $11.95 (seemed much more reasonable). It had FIVE pieces of steak. Yes, FIVE. I counted. Lee, who ordered the chicken fajitas, had quite a bit more chicken in her dish. The taste was good and I really enjoyed the flour tortilla's, but not enough for me to go back. The service was ok. Again, nothing spectacular. As a side note, they dont accept Amex :(
I guess I am still on a quest to find delicious fajitas. Maybe I should just give up."}
{"text":"Until today, this was one of my husbands and my favorite restaurants. We came in for Sunday Brunch with our 4 month old baby. We were having a nice time until a Mariachi band came through the door. Another table had booked this band for themselves. The band proceeded to play and sing so loud that our meal together was effectively over. The baby started screaming and cowering because the music was hurting her ears and I couldn't hear a word my husband was saying. Other tables of diners looked very unhappy as well. The manager offered to move us but I told him it wouldn't have made a difference, the music was so loud. I had to take the baby outside multiple times and my husband had to eat alone. I kept trying to come back inside to the table but the loud music would drive me back out again. I explained to the manager one of the times I came back in that it had ruined our meal, hurt the baby, and it was not okay. I understand that those people who hired the band were trying to do something nice for each other but the restaurant shouldn't have allowed it to upset the other guests. They didn't ask the band to take it down a notch, didn't apologize, and charged us full price for a ruined meal. We won't be back due to the way they allowed our experience to be ruined and didn't even attempt to make it right."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is that they don't know the difference between a Flauta and a Enchilada. If something this basic can't be figured out, I'm skeptical about everything else on the menu. Ordered a flauta, expecting to get a crunchy rolled tortilla and got a cheesy, soft enchilada...whaaaat?!?! Yeah, no. C'mon guys! That's a shame."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food.  My favorite place here in Vegas for Mexican.  Good new location, the place is clean and nice atmosphere.  Good for families and children.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"So happy that Viva Mercado's is back!!! Went this past Saturday and it was awesome! The service was excellent and food amazing! I'm glad that the quality is still there and I really enjoyed the new location. Welcome back!"}
{"text":"OK     Been looking for a local place for Mexican...      Just a casual, flavorful place that I can get great tacos and guacamole and not spend too much money.   So I arrived here at Viva and immediately was surprised by the inside of the place.    From the outside...   its unassuming and looks like it could be a local answer to baja fresh Chipotle...(did I spell that right?)    but its not that...      at all.     The dinning room features a long and inviting bar area and a lot of table space.   So much that almost half of the dinning room was closed off for the lunch service...   no matter.     The decor is warm with a hint of...    dare I say elegance.   (More on that later)

Ordered 2 margaritas and some guacamole.     We keep trying to find guacamole that compares to Segundo on the strip at the Fashion Show Mall.    So out it came...   a bowl of guacamole.    Now...     Having it made table side really makes a difference.   That said...   they didn't do that....   It comes the way it comes.     I like having to option to put a little more lime and heat in it when someone makes it for you at the table.     Listen, it was good, but i found myself wishing it had more of this and that.    Ah well.

Ok Margaritas...      I get it...     you?    a guy?    a margarita?    Ok don't judge me...    the wife and i wanted one...   we got one...   well kind of.    It sure looked like a margarita...   but what it was was likely 3 straight shots of tequila.   That's all fine and good, but I'm not a college student trying to get a girl drunk...      took one sip and ordered a coke    (OK it was a Diet Coke...   again don't judge me)    Here's where we take a turn.     After telling the waiter that it was Waaaay too strong and that I was not going to drink it...   it sat there...    full and mocking me from the glass for the entire meal.   I wonder...     Will I be paying for that drink that I didn't drink and complained about?   Hm

Food was good.   Wife got the enchiladas...   I the Caritas and they were good.   Very good.     and here is the kicker...    they seem to welcome you with little freebies like bean dip,   Fried jalapenos, and after everything they send out a little cinnamon type dessert.      Nice!     Classy!

Ok bill came and yes the drink was on it.     No worry...   I was a waiter in my youth...   I get how booze on a bill is great for your bottom line for tips and I realize that taking it back to the bartender would have been bad for him...    ok.    The classy thing to do would have been to take that one off the bill...   seeing as how it was barely touched and commented on early on in our experience.     

OK so about the place....      It feels nice and welcoming...    a little fancy.    Not what we are looking for.     Listen, I love a burger place, but its not fancy food and I hate a burger place that tries to be an elegant gourmet experience....    I feel the same about Mexican food.      I just want a place that is bright and casual and not fancy...   not so casual that were in baja fresh, but not so fancy either.     

I think I just wish that Segundo had a restaurant closer to us on the west side. 

All in all...   good food...   would defiantly do it again, but was not and is not what we were hoping for.      And hey guys...       when something is not good and commented on, just take it off the bill.     Don't make people have to be that person who asks to \"Talk to the Manager\" to do what you know is the right thing."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican restaurant!!!

- Nice Mexican decor inside, nice patio outside
- Friendly staff & waiters
- Free chips and salsas, free light dessert
- Huge menu with authentic Mexican dishes
- Huge portions

My wife and I had the pork/carnitas tacos and they were delicious!  Totally authentic, just like the tacos we had in Mexico."}
{"text":"Good mexican food in Hawaii is quite scarce so I'm always looking for good mexican food when traveling,  Viva Mercado's is one of those places  I've been here a couple of times now and will surely be back whenever I'm in Vegas.  The food is solid, portions are generous and the service is friendly and attentive...and of course, the margaritas hit the spot!

The things I've had and have sampled by sponging off of a friend's plate...
Pollo en mole pablano which was delicious, the Mole sauce was dark, rich, and tasty.
Chimichango de pollo asado, had it with both the green and red sauce.
Pollo chile chipotle con crema, creamy and spicy sauce which was very tasty. 

One of the things that I like and the reason that I always leave with leftovers is that besides offering complimentary tortilla chips and salsa and refried beans, they also start you off with some sauteed jalapenos and onions.  It's great to start off with a few chips and top it with some of the jalapenos and onions with a spoon of salsa...super satisfying to wash that down with a sip...I mean gulp, of margarita!  They also include a cup of fideo soup if you order an entree.  

And if that wasn't enough, at the end of the meal, we were brought some deep fried flour tortilla wedges that were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup, then topped with some whipped cream.  A light and sweet way to end a meal when you're already packed to gills with tasty food.

I'll be looking forward to eating here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I definitely loved the place. I stopped in for some
To Go items and had a margarita at the bar while waiting. The drink was grreeat and I was tipsy half way through :) Met some nice people at the bar and made new friends!

I ordered the 3 combo with chicken and fish tacos and a burrito; a steak quesadilla, chili con queso and a large side of guac. Everything was awesome. Portions are huge, so the 3 combo is perfect for 3 people. Steak quesadilla is pretty darn good but was insanely salty. Omg omg Omg. So much salt. I had to break it up with lots of beer at home..... 

Tacos were aight. Nothing really to die for but did the job. I had to give the grilled chicken from one of them to my dogs because they were losing their minds. Happy kids when they get human treats. Ah.

Burrito..l will have tomorrow and update this post. 

The only thing that I was absolutely disappointed with and wish I could just smash against the wall is the FLAN. Completely curdled and a fricking mess of a dessert. Curdled, egg-y tasting bullshit. Goddamn it. This is what I was looking forward to the most. 

Side note: We had Sierra Nevada Otra Vez beer with dinner and it was pretty darn good. 

Flan!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My Mexican food experiences are limited however I do believe I know quality quite well. The ambiance and decor is nice and they are accommodating to parties of all sizes. We started with the queso fundido which was recommended to us by our waiter this was good but not great. The chips bean dip and salsa were all delicious and the Fideo soup included with your meal was pretty good as well. The tortillas did not have the fresh made taste to them. I took home an order of Flan to go it was curdled, if I was served this in the restaurant I would have asked for it to be taken back. I would probably try another local restaurant before heading back. I will update my review on my next visit."}
{"text":"First and foremost this review is coming from a Mexican that absolutely dread going to a Mexican restaurant because although most of you guys have a thought about what is authentic I actually know, and most restaurants in Vegas fell short. Having said that I was stumbled across this restaurant in accident as we were looking for another place for dinner. As I walked in we were greeted by a very nice hostess who welcomed us and directed us to our table. Immediately our waiter came up and offered us drinks, I hadn't had a chance to look at the menu due to the amazing atmosphere and live music that I just ordered coke. When he brought out drinks I saw that they had orchata (my favorite) which he happily exchanged for. My wife ordered chile rellenos and I tried the nachos (because it's very hard, extremely hard to mess up nachos) and my son ordered from the kids menu. When the food arrived they looked amazing and to my surprise tasted even better then they looked. I really enjoyed my meal and even had enough left over for the next day. I have gone back to this place like three times since I had those nachos. I would like to thank you guys for such amazing food, you made a regular out of me."}
{"text":"Excellent food, not so excellent service.  But, I'm giving this place a pass because we did go here on Cinco De Mayo so maybe they were busy?  It didn't look like it... it looked more like they were skimping on servers and there was literally one server for the entire restaurant.  The bus boy was sweet and did his best to keep us happy, filling our waters, giving us our compliimentary tortilla chips and jalapeno. That was pretty good. The food is great.  Salsa is great.  I would definitely come here again, I just hope they hire a few more people."}
{"text":"I love the vegetarian options they have here. I get the Guacamole tacos plate it's soooooo yummy! My husband likes the chicken quesadilla and we both love the frozen maragritas."}
{"text":"This has been a family favorite for 20 years. I love their summerlin-adjacent location. It's so convenient, parking is easy, and the movie theater is right there. The food here is authentic, fresh, and delicious. The service is friendly and efficient. The bar area is casual with a nice selection of Mexican draft beer and delicious margaritas."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was definitely as great as everyone says! 
From the time we walked in we were greeted immediately and sat in a both. Walter was our server, he was very pleasant & kind! The food was absolutely amazing- everything was on point and chips and salsa were great as well! 
Ordered the burrito & Fajitas... which was plenty of good! 
My better half loves to drink water like no other... so they kept filling up his water! Loved everything and the overall experience! 
At the end Walter brought us a complimentary dessert which tasted just like a churro!!!"}
{"text":"The last three trips were even better! I want to try everything on the menu and love this place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have this close to home. We went Friday night had great service and great food. Chile Colorado is the best I have had. They give you lots of food at a decent price and everything we had at table was very good to excellent. 

Went back for lunch Sunday and food was just as good at a decent price. 

If you like Mexican food come here. 

Also we noticed how nice the interior was decorated. Place looked good and was clean and open."}
{"text":"I like to eat at the bar because I'm a huge sports fan!, and they have a great bartender that makes phenominal drinks, but it seems like every time I've been in there, he's always working an looks a little run down, but always friendly.  Probably would suggest you hire more reliable bartenders like the one that's always there.
."}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! Great service, great drinks, the food is phenomenal! I've easily tried half the food on their menu and loved all of it. The prices are shockingly cheap for the quality food they serve. The Pozole is amazing!"}
{"text":"Solid 4, borderline 5 star. Great food, staff, atmosphere and value. If you're thinking of going to Poncho's in Downtown Summerlyn, skip that overpriced, under-qualitied, pompous POS and go 2 miles down Sahara at Fort Apache and get a real good Mexican meal at Viva Mercado's.
Chilli Colorado was excellent."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very nice people. Not loud. Enchiladas are the best we have had. They have all of the traditional Mexican dishes but are very willing to accommodate vegans and vegetarians. Bean dip available with it without cheese. Guacamole and salsa great. This is our second time to eat here & we will be back next time we are in town.highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! The inside decor is beautiful and authentic. A great spot for a night out. The staff is friendly and the owner is super sweet and you can tell she cares about the restaurant! The asada fries and fried ice cream are musts!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials and a friendly, attentive staff (read: a few minutes before happy hour ended, they made sure to ask if we wanted one more round...yes!) Very impressed. We only ordered house margaritas and a few appetizers, however they were all great. Will come back soon for a proper dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly staff. Huge portions.   Customized our order to a gluten free meal without any questions. 

Tacos, burritos, tamales were a huge hit. Chips are served warm and are fresh as could be. Great salsa and retries beans. Very reasonable price.

They even gave us a free desert!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT BASA FISH TACOS/ my brother did not enjoy the burrito Carne Asada. The service was so so.... The margarita I would give a 3/5 tops.  I would come here again for the fish tacos & the DELICIOUS black bean soup."}
{"text":"What an amazing find for delicious, flavorful mexican food. They have several types of salsas from fiery habanero to mild pico and they serve  fried jalapenos with chips - all complementary. We ordered black bean soup and veggie fajitas and devoured our meal. The host and servers were very nice and friendly. My only constructive feedback is that please add chicken broth free rice to your menu for vegetarians. We will definitely visit again on our next vegas vacation"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm from the East Coast and every time I visit Vegas I always come here for my Mexican food fix. I always get a quesadilla and a virgin piña colada. Always fill me up! Another thing I love is there refried bean dip! Wish they would put it in jars and sell it cause it is so good. And the staff is super friendly and funny. I will continue coming here until I can't no more!"}
{"text":"I just happen to see the marquee on the corner when looking for Mexican food.   Excellent customer service.   Staff was friendly and consistently attentive.   My only grope was the table salsa tasted like spaghetti sauce.  (heavy tomato flavor)  I was offered roasted jalapeño and onions just before the food came.  My blended margarita was fabulous and they offer lunch pricing.   Suitable for my 5 yr old too.  Wish it were closer to Centennial Hills"}
{"text":"Overall food was good. Ordered 3 item combo. Was really disappointed with the Chicken Tamale. Inside masa was kinda icy cold, chicken was dry, very little sauce, masa edges dry and tough. Kind of like they microwaved frozen tamales?
I took two small bites & left the rest. 
A good waiter should ask if anything was wrong with food upon seeing barely eaten tamale? I will eat here again but won't ever order Tamales here again. 
Service was mediocre. We were seated quickly as place was near empty but had to ask for utensils. Long wait for food. Rest of food was good & worth 4 stars but because of the Tamales & service a 3 star at most.

{"text":"Great service as well as food! Came here for my birthday and had their carne asada burrito. It was so huge I can't believe I finished it. The service was absolutely amazing. I couldn't finish a soda without them refilling it. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice for lunch, and have enjoyed both times.  In the past I have always rated a Mexican restaurant by their chili relleno - is it greasy from too much oil, is the cheese totally melted inside, is the batter crisp and covering all of the chili or is it sloughing off, and is the sauce flavorful with a touch if spice - and Viva Mercado's met my expectations with one if the best chilis rellenos I have had!  Service was good both times, and they will make your margarita to order - Sauza Commeritivo and Cointreau on the rocks, sin sal!  Que bueno!  Their sliced, grilled jalapeños and onions are a delight; you cut them up and add to whatever you want, as much or little as your preference. My second lunch I was able to speak at length with Victor, Bobby's brother, and we reviewed restaurants past, such as Viva Zapata's on Tropicana and Maryland - yes, I was born here - does anyone else remember El Cholo on Fifth Street - I mean Las Vegas Blvd South?  And their carne asada tacos were very good as well.  However the great draw for me is their veggie tamale!  I came to love green corn tamales in Phoenix, at Manuel's on 32nd and Indian School, and until Viva Mercado's opened they were not to be found.  I have died and gone to Heaven!  In addition, their beans are flavorful and not runny, their quacamole is very good with the jalapeños and onions to add for more heat, their salsa and chips are fresh and the latter not greasy either time I was there.    And even better - nopales!  Their interior decor is lovely, the ambiance and noise level is great, and I am taking our daughter and granddaughters there on Saturday.  Life is good."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to this resturaunt and the food is as good if not better than my favorite Mexican resturaunt in Texas."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! We live two min away and have been here several times. Our drinks were so bad we had to order extra shots to taste the tequila. Husband always orders the same Green Chili Pork Burrito and it always comes with green sauce. I ordered my dish with Flour tortillas (corn torts are never my preference). His arrived with red sauce and I was given corn tortillas. We wait for our server to do the two bite check back (basic service standard), and after about 5 min we give up and dig in. I ask our awesome busser for flour torts and our server. When our server LAZARO dropped the check, I asked him why we were given red sauce and he got very defensive and said we didn't ask for green and the computer always prompts him red (??). So then I say just so you know I ordered flour not corn and he nearly lost it on me. He vehemently denied what I ordered and I felt like I was in trouble and at fault. So unprofessional and prideful!! I've been serving for over 15 years and know better, and so should he! The WORST part is that he was chatting with the gentleman (I assume the owner who is always standing at the bar) and as we got up to leave he gave me an epic stare up and down. I truly hope he is not the owner of this establishment and I am wrong!! I wasn't looking for a comp, just a recognition of what happened. Nada damn thing. Never going back and have already told my friends to go back to Lindo M!"}
{"text":"YAHOOOOOO!!!! Viva Mercado is back! We've been devout fans for YEARS and were so bummed when it closed. 

Of course we were hopeful that the menu, service and food quality we love hadn't changed. It hasn't. Fideo soup, bean dip and chips & awesome salsa came with a smile. Margaritas were jamming and our favorite items were just as delicious as before. I have to say, the new location is great- updated, clean and comfortable.

Thank you Viva Mercado- we are so glad you're back!"}
{"text":"Love this place - cute and yummy !!! Unfortunately they Don't take American Express cards which sucks :(((("}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for the first time this week and we will definitely be going back. Friendly staff, great authentic food, and large portions at fair prices. Someone else left a review to \"not go here unless you have a couple hours.\" Our service was very quick - food came out within 10 minutes and we had our check in a timely manner. I think she had an isolated incident. Good job Mercado's"}
{"text":"Here I am again to praise this amazing restaurant! We had friends visiting from out of town and they wanted Mexican food! So what better place than one of my favorite spots, right here at Viva Mercado! The loved the food, the ambiance and of course, the wait staff is absolutely wonderful! You truly feel at home when you are here and our friends loved it SO much, they drove from the strip (they were staying at Plant Hollywood), to have lunch here the following day! (yes, they went without us! LOL).... 

Always a great spot! If you are a tourist, it's not that far from the strip and it beats the overpriced, strip food. If you are looking for a great Mexican food hotspot, authentic, tasty and with awesome customer service, throw on that GPS and head here!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food for sure! Never disappoints every time we come. We finally had room for dessert tonight and ordered the fried ice cream. Don't leave without trying it! It was so good! And to top it off the service is like no other restaurant. We had the nicest servicer Luis r."}
{"text":"This  review is only for a to go order of tamales. Ordered a full pan of pork tamales which had 20 total. The total was 75.00 dollars. First off these are the biggest tamales I have ever seen! They are not made with masa which I happened to like because it is not as heavy or fatty. They had a great taste to them and were spicy. I didn't really like how the pork on the inside was not chopped up, it was in big chunks. The amount for the price was good mad they also gave you a lot of hot sauce both green and red and those were great."}
{"text":"I came to Viva Mercado with my family, the waiter Tony  was super sweet and attentive. We ordered burritos, quesadillas and I ordered huevos ranchos (AMAZING). The ambiance was perfect. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"Just like any other awesome Vegas find, this place was tucked away in a corner of a strip mall! Definitely didn't disappoint. The service was awesome and our waiter Ignacio was great. I always judge a Mexican place by its chips and salsa and street tacos.... Again, was not disappointed. I'll definitely be bringing out of town guests here!"}
{"text":"Good food,  large portions, friendly service,  and a spacious atmosphere with a decent sized bar.  Prices are moderate and the food is fresh and authentic.   Most meals come with soup, rice and beans,  and a small complimentary dessert snack is provided for the entire table.  

The exterior of the restaurant is non impressive,  but don't be discouraged.   The interior is spacious and inviting.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We found this place accidentally when we were grabbing pies from Coldstones. Boy are we glad we did. The service is OUTSTANDING! Luis was our server and let me tell you, we will always ask for him. He was nice, attentive, fast, friendly and an absolute joy. The rest of the staff was amazing as well. The drinks were fantastic and hit the spot. The food? OMG! Best mexican food we've had in a while. The entire experience was phenomenal and we will be back. I think we found our new spot. Thank you Luis and all your amazing staff. You guys ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here, but my first time for dinner. We were a party of six and the  food was excellent and our server, Louis, was fabulous. Will definitely be back. Only issue was the credit card machine went down. Luckily, we had cash."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch and were very pleased with our food and the service.  I had been to their old location a few times but somehow had always overlooked the new place tucked in the corner of Village Square even though I'm here for movies often.

We were seated promptly, brought our iced teas, and given plenty of time to look over the lunch menu.  We were also brought chips and salsa and refried beans.  The salsa was very good with a very nice tang to it.

My wife ordered the pollo ala Mexicana and I ordered thew chicharrones with nopales.  Both dishes were very good.  Each was served with refried beans and a small salad.  I wish the nopales were fresh but they were pickled and mixed in with the chicharrones.  

We were looking at the dessert menu when a server brought us some fried tortillas dipped in cinnamon and sugar with a dollop of whipped cream and cherry and some chocolate syrup.  There was no need to order dessert.  This was just the small kind of ending we were looking for.

Service was excellent!  Our iced teas never wanted for refills and the food is good.  I like the layout of the restaurant and it's larger than it appears from the outside.  There's a small patio dining area to make of use of now that it's getting cooler and we'll have to come back.  Viva Mercado's is close to being a 4 star place.  I hope to up the rating after another visit."}

Offer complimentary desert . If you enjoy home made chips and salsa and home made Mexican food this is the place very inexpensive for the money . 
Enjoy 

Luv this place real family oriented and happy hour"}
{"text":"We've done a search for years for a replacement Mexican restaurant for our favorite that closed by our house. We now found it but unfortunately it's on the other side of town from us. The food is absolutely fabulous! Not touristy and a great locals restaurant. I wouldn't presume review any one item in particular but you can't go wrong with whatever you order."}
{"text":"Smaller than their last place but the food is just as good.  Best Mexican food in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were AMAZING! Potentially the best I've ever had! Food was great too- we definitely plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Guy Fieri's Burro Borracho has nothing on Viva Mercado!  (Had dinner there last night). We had the chilaquiles con chorizo and pollo con crema de chipotle!  Excellent food and service.  The margaritas are also very good and to top things off, you get a complimentary buñuelo with whip cream and caramel!  Definitely worth the 15 minute drive from the strip!  We'll be back here again next time!"}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened but the quality of food has gone down. The taste of their food used to be very authentic Mexican food now it tastes more like a Taco Bell version it's quite sad. I've actually been coming to this restaurant since they were located on Rainbow and let me tell you the food has changed not for the good."}
{"text":"I was told this place has excellent Mexican food, but they were mistaken. To start my experience, my fiancé ordered a coke and received a Pepsi. The server never mentioned they only had Pepsi products. Oh and my other friend ordered a water and received a Pepsi. They brought us some sort of soup before the meal which tasted a lot like a can of microwave noodle soup. Not impressed. When I got my beef enchilada the meat was actually cooked wonderfully, however, it was accompanied by the most horrendous beans I've ever tasted. I was just not impressed with this place at all."}
{"text":"So disappointed at my dining experience here... I used to love this place but it went out of my mind a little when they moved locations. Well I decided to stop in a few days ago and found that the place was pretty empty... strange I thought bc this place was always crowded and lively...I should have taken the hint... apparently others feel the way I do. service was very slow even though it wasn't crowded.. took forever just to get water... oh yea also ordered the fried jalapeños twice and they were never brought out...I ordered chili rellanos... when they came out the chesse was a hard brick of cold cheese and the flavor was bland. Long story short.. this used to be the bomb but looks like they lost their touch.....

This is an add on after the manager's comment:
I love how the manager attacks anyone that has something critical to say about his restaurant.. instead of apologizing for the incident and trying to make it better... and no sir I did not bring it up to the waiter because I'm not looking for a free meal.. it was edible and I ate it therefore I feel I should pay for it.. it was however NOT good... furthermore after my wife(who left a review as well) discovered a 3 inch long piece of \"tissue paper\" ...as you so duly corrected her in her review... buried inside her Asado salad we were really just ready to cut our losses and leave... your contempt for the customer is simply amazing and I was going to drop the issue with the foreign substance in her food but now we will move forward with a complaint to the health district. And of course we will never nor will any of our friends eat there again."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas.  The flavors were excellent and the service was great.   Next trip to Las Vegas from LA will require a visit for dinner and margi's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food spots in Las Vegas. My family has been enjoying this food from location to location since the 1990's! I went today for a some New Year's grub. Delicious bean dip comes with chips and salsa. I ordered chicken nachos and they let me get shredded and grilled chicken! That was super cool of them, since I couldn't decide. Very reasonable priced, and I enjoyed the people working and the atmosphere just the same as I did when I was a child!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed because I was looking at all the good reviews and being a Mexican myself you can judge good authentic food when you taste it. They serve salsa and chips like every mex restaurant so nothing new there. The fideo soup was actually realllly good. But then I ordered green enchiladas and sadly it wasn't good at all. The tortillas were soggy and the green chili sauce just didn't taste good I thought it was a little watery. Another thing is the complimentary desert that is nice but overall I would say I'm sticking to Lindo Michoacán."}
{"text":"I grew up in California, so I have pretty high expectations when it comes to Mexican Food. A group of friends and I decided to give this place a shot. The food was great and the chips and salsa were very good as well. I was a little disappointed in the price (way too expensive) and the drinks. We ordered Sangria   that was basically vodka, cranberry, with a splash of pineapple juice or OJ. :( 

Overall good food and service. Sergio is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Food is much better than the previous mexican restaurant that was here. Quantity of food is great, prices fair. There was one guy in our entire section trying to order took quite awhile and we had to flag someone down. Getting refills and our check was just as equally hard. They certainly need to hire more help overall we would come back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is fantastic, service is top notch and margaritas are tasty!  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  Truly authentic!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night for my birthday, let's start with the service.  I had a table reserved in the front away from the kitchen. A lady had a table reserved as well next to us.  She made a big fuss about not wanting to sit by the kitchen and not wanting to share the room, so we where asked to move. The waiter was the only good thing about this place, he was very knowledgeable about the dishes, but the dishes where misleading, they use artificial chicken for a $17 plate, which one of my guest had to send back because it left a lingering taste in her mouth. We both work in the food industry and we know our food... Overall the food was bland without flavor and very over priced. I love Mexican food and have been to plenty of Mexican restaurants and this by far was one of the worse food, as food and service. That's just sad the busser continued to brush me off as I asked him questions,  just act like they where really ready for us to leave,  so we just got to go boxes and left because it was an unwelcoming feeling. The only reason for 2 stars is the server, he was nice.. shame on this place, maybe all this 5 stars came from people sitting at the bar and got their food for cheap (happy hour).  Completely over priced, not quality food.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Try the texas style enchiladas with shredded beef, they're out of this world!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there a few months ago we are from California. We loved and I mean LOVED the service,food and atmosphere. Tony was a incredible the owner came out and was so nice. We are going to do a over nighter and come in for dinner.. Thanks for the great food and service 
Ken and Kim"}
{"text":"This place has the perfect decor and atmosphere for a Mexican restaurant but my carne Asada quesadilla was completely terrible, I could only finish one piece.  I had such high hopes for this place but I can't believe they messed up something as basic as a quesadilla."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this place a try and made a bold move to done-in with my 1 year old. The moment I walked in I was immediately seated and served chips, salsa and bean dip. They took our drink order and had them at the table a minute later.

I ordered the lunch combination plate with a veggie tamale and chili relleno. Served with beams and rice. My kids ordered quesadillas and chicken enchilada off the kids menu. One got a side of beam and rice the other two fries. I loved the face they have other side options for children. I must admit that was some of the best food we ever had eating out! Full of flavor and great portions .

The customer service is the best I've ever had in all of Las Vegas and California! There was not a moment I had to go searching for help. The waiter was always there when we needed him and always made sure we had full glasses of our drinks. Despite the few mishaps we had, the servers never took a smile off their faces and even brought out some of the best banuelos we've ever had.

If I had to make a choice to dine out with my kids, it will always be here. Very kid/family friendly. Love the welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was great !  Carne Asada Rellono super!!  Super fresh...great service...authentic...good portions....you will like it!"}
{"text":"The people here are so nice! 
Good food.  They give you beans and salsa with your chips."}
{"text":"pretty good food. service was excellent.  beans were to be expected but rice was better than most places.  Fideo soup was the best I've had."}
{"text":"After having Mexican food all over the country I have to say this one I will not be going back.  With all the good Mexican in Vegas you can let this one go. 

We ordered chicken fajitas, steak fajitas, chili Riano, and a chicken salad. The chicken fajitas were overspiced and tough as a rock. The steak fajitas were rubber coated to look like me and also overspiced. The chili Riano was not like any I have had any where else and no good. 

I heard this place was great so we tried it. Not the case I would.

We visited the location on Thursday night June 7th."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Vegas.  Best salsas (they have around 10 kinds).  The bartenders are AWESOME and fun, especially Jay.  Everyone is friendly, great service.  Love love love this place.  My only complaint is that the tables have a lot of stuff on them and they get pretty crowded.  I have asked our waiter to please remove all the extra stuff, like candle and drink menu and they are happy to do so."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite spot to eat at! We're regulars here at Mercado's. We use to go to the one on spring mtn before they closed & moved to this location, which I think is much more better! The service is great, food is amazing & drinks are supreme. I always get the margaritas or daiquiris. They give big portions for a reasonable price. Serve chips w/ salsa & bean dip at the table & at the end give you a kind of like a cinnamon pita chip type of dessert on the house. I highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was so fresh and wonderful! We just recently moved here and everyone suggests going to Juan's, but we liked this place way better! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Okay we have eaten here at least 8x by now...loved every time.  Always seem to sit at the bar as a standard, but found table service is great too.  This is the standard for Mexican food in Las Vegas, and holds its own anywhere. Try the queso dip with Shrimp.  The combo is fantastic and highly addictive."}
{"text":"The service is amazing.... The food is authentic my new favorite spot. The chile Colorado so tender and juicy. The complementary dessert was perfection. That margarita kept coming and I loved it. I will be back sooner than later"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, when leaving a review on Yelp, I'm forced to give at least 1 star. If it were up to me, is leave a -1. I cannot review the food because WE DIDN'T even get to try it out. We just left actually and I'm fuming so I figured I needed to leave a review before I forgot to do so. We sat down and a waiter came and brought chips, no salsa or bean dip. Our drinks came and he immediately walked away and NEVER CAME BACK. We were there with a 2 year old and 5 month old and we sat for almost half and hour waiting for someone to even look at us to take our order and NOTHING. My husband ordered tea so we left a $5 on the table and left and no one in the restaurant said a word as they watched us walk out. We just moved here from Texas and we're hoping to find a great New Mexican place. WE WILL NOT RETURN. When service is that bad, it makes it hard to give another shot to a place like this.

We would have just walked out, but I didn't feel right about leaving when we ordered an iced tea. I'll bet the waiter pocketed our $5."}
{"text":"I was very unhappy, came with a group of my family. 
Saw it had good ratings but I am very unhappy. 
The waiter came and helped us it seemed fast, but then after we ordered it took a very long time. Once the food got here it had absolutely no flavor, all the food we got was terrible. The tacos were terrible. The soups were over salted. 

We left most of our food.. It was so bad. 

very unhappy. Never recommending this place or coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was impressed when I first walked in to this place; the hostess was attentive and the place was extremely clean. After I was seated Walter, my waiter was at the table to take my drink order and answered my questions about the menu; he was pleasant, knowledgeable and very polite. 

The lunch menu is quite large and I had a little trouble making a decision so Walter suggested the carnitas, I immediately got chips, salsa and refried beans brought to me. The salsa, homemade was delicious and should be sold by the pint! The carnitas was moist and flavorful, the rice tasty and this is the first time ever that I ate black beans and liked them.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Glad to see them back after closing down for awhile! Great Mexican food with amazing flavor and fresh ingredients! Service is always excellent! Staff is very courteous and makes sure your needs are taken care of! Food comes out hot and in good time! The restaurant is clean and looks great! A great addition to the summerlin/lakes area! Love the salsa too! Prices are on the high side but your paying for good food so I can't really complain! All in all a great place for real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food by far anywhere in the Vegas valley! Always great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I work in the industry so I come to appreciate great service a lot more let me just say that from the servers like Luis who guide you into making a good choice when your unfamiliar with the menu to the host summer who made me feel like I was a regular coming in to our busser gerber who was on top of everything making sure we ate in a clean work environment and let me just say the quality of food for the price was outstanding it was such a big portion and I'm leaving well sated and I know I'm coming for seconds and thirds I'm making this my dine in place period and the manager Chris set it all in stone by coming over and making sure we ate great and had a great experience to all the staff thank you for giving 5 star service and some more I'll definitely be seeing you guys again I recommend this to everyone and its for everyone"}
{"text":"Hands down in my top 3 best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas! For sure #2 and maybe even #1 once I try ALL entrees. The tacos and enchiladas are excellent. 

Bean dip before the dinner that comes is super tasty. I ordered two bowls of it.

Strawberry marguerites are fruity but stiff if you know what I mean. 

Customer service here is absolutely great. Couldn't of been taken care of any better.

VIVA viva mercados!!!!! Great place for parties and private event dinners!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this Viva Mercado's! Maybe I'm biased. But come on, free warm chips and salsa AND beans?! And grilled veggies all came out to our table as soon as we sat down. Boyfriend ordered an enchilada plate (~$15) and I had a plate of their fried fish taco and chile rellano ($~16). Both orders came with a bowl of some tomato-like soup with noodles. I ate too much of the chips and soup that I was already full by the time our entrees came. These plates were HUGE. Chile rellano was advertised on the front of their large menu as one of the best, but it was average. Extra cheesy, though, which I love. Fish taco wasn't bad. Chicken enchilada was hearty and we were able to even take half of it home for breakfast the next day. A fried, sugary and cinnamony tortilla chip with whipped cream was brought out after we had paid. 
Service was impeccable. Inside is decorated beautifully. They have an overwhelming amount of options, and can cater to vegans and vegetarians as well :-)"}
{"text":"I loved the service here! The environment is nice and clean. The staff is extremely attentive. (Constantly refilling drinks) the food was surprisingly good for a chain restaurant. I was with a groups of 3 we all ate for around $60 !! Which considering we could barely walk out we were so full  would definitely return to this location !"}
{"text":"We love it here! Never disappointing  food is great and the people are fantastic! Some of the best mex food you will find"}
{"text":"OMG I can't say enough- I just found out basically everything is home made here!! I've been eating here for YEARS- and I've only lived in Vegas for a Decade-
This is Medicine to me. If you are a foodie- this is a Must- I think I've only ever ordered the nachos/ carne asade"}
{"text":"No words can described the food, staff, and everything in between!! Awesome experience with my young man & my young woman!!! They absolutely love this place! Luis you're awesome!!! 
Thank you for making us feel so very special!!"}
{"text":"An excellent choice for quick traditional Mexican in a relaxed \"cantina\" atmosphere.

Viva Mercado's used to be open on Rainbow, but has moved to the shopping center where 808 Tapas, Bachi Burger, and Buldogis is located. It is actually deeper into the shopping center located next to a coffee shop and a few boutique clothing stores.

I dined here with a co-worker during a slow afternoon around 2 PM. 

Chips are served to each table with salsa AND bean dip, yum! Choices my friends, I love choices. As for my meal, I selected the chicken burrito that comes with rice, beans, and pico de gallo. My co-worker was paying for the meal, so I didn't want to get too spendy. He ordered the carne asada torta, which looked great and he said was awesome.

My chicken burrito was excellent with moist chicken inside and a red sauce on top with melted cheese. What I really enjoyed about it was that it was not MASSIVELY HUGE. Nor was the amount of beans and rice on my plate. I think in a time when people are just eating way too much food I applaud restaurants that are willing to NOT slop massive amounts of side dishes on plates OR create such huge burritos no one in their right mind would sit at a table at eat it all at once.

Service was a bit slow. Our drinks were refilled, but we waited quite awhile for the check. Our server disappeared from the restaurant floor for about 10-12 minutes and we had to wave down the busser to get him to come out and bring our check.

Overall if I were in the area again and wanted Mexican I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good chips and salsa but that's about it.  Our meal was ok however, one person's tacos were so soft they couldn't be picked up. They ate only the inside with a fork and said they weren't impressed.  The wrong margaritas came to the table however the taste was fine.  However, I DO NOT APPRECIATE BEGING CHARGED THE WRONG PRICE and for the WRONG MARGARITA.    I pointed the incorrect price out to the waiter and nothing was done.  What was more astonishing was that I told the owner about this and she gave me her card for \"next time.\" WHAAAAT?   If there's a problem with the bill you DO NOT FIX IT NEXT TIME, YOU FIX IT THIS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There won't be a NEXT TIME if this time isn't fixed.  

People are nice but have NO CLUE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  There are far too many options in the area for food that customers won't tolerate poor service and a lack of common sense.  We specifically came to here and went out of our way...not again."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing but amazing things to say about this place!!! Service is nothing short or amazing and the food is absolutely delicious!! Our servers name was Ignacio, and his busser/helper together are an amazing team!! Will be requesting them next time....
I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I haven't enjoyed a meal this much in a long time.  I'd been to Viva Mercado's once before, when it shared a parking lot with Walmart on Charleston and Decatur (or maybe it was somewhere else).  It was our friends' favorite Mexican, and we liked it.  Maybe it was the location, but we never went back.

Fast forward more than a few years, and this new incarnation, in a reincarnated shopping center with bunch of trendy restaurants, is a winner.  From the service to the ambience to the food, we couldn't have been more pleased.

Our waiter, who I think was named Alfredo, was exceptional. He recommended the sauce (Costeña) for my chicken, and it was spot on - rated 5 (out of 10) on their heat scale, and just the right amount of spice for me.  Like all the dinner plates, it came with a cup of tasty fideos soup, refried beans, rice, and some salad.  The chicken was so astoundingly good that when I took home half the dinner and couldn't have it the next night (due to a \"previous commitment\"), I was actually craving it!  I did manage to scarf it down the following night.

My husband had the Tilapia Salad and that, too, was terrific.  He didn't bring home any leftovers, but not because it was a small portion.

Sangria was supposed to have a \"crown of brandy\", but I didn't taste any.  I think the crown needs a few more jewels.  It's not sweet, which might be off-putting to some, but I was glad it wasn't syrupy.  While nicely decorated with an orange slice and a couple of pineapple slices, there wasn't any fruit in the drink.  The chips weren't overly salty, and we enjoyed the bean dip.

Our waiter gifted us with buñuelos for dessert.  Normally, I'd never order them, but who could resist the pretty, cracker-like triangles, drizzled with chocolate syrup and a dab of whipped cream, placed in front of us and crying out \"Eat Me!\"  We sure couldn't!

Since moving to Vegas a decade ago, Mexican food hasn't been high on our list of go-to places, but our recent first visit to Frank & Fina's, and now Viva Mercado, has upped the ante.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On Thursday July 10th I was early for a meeting and stopped in for a late lunch during their happy hour. I was a bit bothered by not being informed  that for the happy hour menu and pricing I needed to sit at the bar area. I was seated and then asked if I wanted to move after placing my drink order. So why the four stars? The food was great outstanding favor made up for it all. The next time I will know to seat at the bar area for happy hour. If you want an excellent Mexican meal this is the place."}
{"text":"Chips, beans, and salsa are great!!! So were the Cadillac Margaritas!!!!
I ordered the Mulitas, corn tortilla topped w/beans and cheese then your choice meat... I had chicken and carnitas... then topped with cabbage, queso fresco, guacamole, and sour cream. These were very tasty! I liked the carnitas a bit more than the chicken. I will def try the carne asada next time!
My husband had the Parrillada de Marescos.... Marinated Basa Fillet, Shrimp, Langostino, & Scallops over grilled onions & salsa quemala... the flavor of this dish was AMAZING!!!!
Food was really slow coming out, but they were really busy.
I ate so much of the chips, beans, and salsa (which again were great) that I couldn't hardly eat my dinner.
Left overs were still good the next day!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. My friend and I came here for dinner because the owner is from Chicago and I heard about the place from Chicagoans in the Desert. It is a new place in a strip mall next to the movie theatre. Can't remember which Mexican place it used to be but the interior is exactly the same. Very cool atmosphere. 

The complimentary chips and salsa they bring you are sooooo good. They also bring you a small plate of spicy grilled jalapeños and they are amazing - a little on the hot side but I love em. 

The menu is HUGE!! If you can't find something to eat here you have issues because they have a little of everything. I ordered two apps - seafood taquitos and 
Nopales. Whaaaaat!! Fresh nopales are quite rare at Mexican places so I always order when I see them on the menu. They are definitely not from a jar. 

The seafood taquitos are decent but not my favorite. Had pieces of baby lobster and shrimp which was tasty. 

My friend ordered combo tacos beef and chicken. She also ordered fresh guacamole which was incredible. 

Back to the nopales. They are served hot win onions and bell peppers. Seasoned nicely. I could have eaten this all week. I took some home and ate them cold the next day - they tasted even better!!!!! My mom used to make them fresh like this so it's sort of nostalgic for me. Nom nom nom!!!

There was also this mariachi walking around and singing some great music. He was so sweet. He came over and talked to us for a while, just a real nice man.  

Come and check this place out!! And get the nopales!!! 

:)"}
{"text":"It was satisfying, if not spectacular. I had a 2 item plate with carne asada burrito and pork tamale. They were both good, as were the sides of rice and beans, but it lacked something to get me excited. We will be back, as it was an enjoyable experience, but we might try another place first."}
{"text":"What can I say? The Carne Asada is delicious and I love coming here! SO GOOD! The interior is also very cozy."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I recently came here for a quick happy hour bite to eat before a movie at village square. There was a bit of confusion wether you're able to order happy hour food at only the bar or the bar and table, but I was able to get the happy hour food pricing at a table luckily. 

We started out the meal with complimentary chips, salsa, bean dip, grilled onion and peppers. All very tasty! For an entree I had the tilapia fish tacos. I obviously went with corn tortillas because who orders flour, gross. The flavor was delicious and the tacos were huge! They def did not skimp on the fish either.  

I would definitely come back here again! Very quick service, awesome food and a convenient location."}
{"text":"Live right down the street from this place and never knew it was here for a year and a half already! Food was great and the service even better! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loved her dinner yesterday ( Chili Relleno). Mine was just o.k. Mariscos Adobados Lots of shrimp but where was the other seafood....disappointed to say the least
Service was excellent.
That's about it."}
{"text":"Every single time I have came here to eat, I am always more than pleased with the service and food. The food is always excellent. They do not use lard which majority of Mexican restaurants do and they cook their food with canola oil. The waiters work together to make sure you have what you need and have awesome attitudes about it. When I went in one time, we probably requested five or six additional items and they had great attitudes about it as if they actually WANTED to help and satisfy me! That is why I always come back and back again. I have nothing but positive things to say about this restaurant, food, and the best customer service I have ever received in Las Vegas, period."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  The Tomatillo echiladas are the best you will ever have.

Beautiful restaurant and bar.  Everything you would expect from a Mexican restaurant is upgraded at Viva Mercados.  They start you with perfect chips and high quality salsa and creamy beyond belief bean dip.  For salsa fans they have a large selection of salsas of varying heats.  They also provide a perfect little plate of seasoned onions and chile peppers.  The menu is huge but everything I have had here is good."}
{"text":"It was an okay experience. The margaritas could have been better and stronger. I am glad that they do have a happy hour. However, it felt short staffed because we could never get a hold of our server, and the food took a little too long. Also, my order was slightly incorrect. Otherwise, the food is decent, it doesn't disappoint from what it would be in comparison to other Mexican sit-down restaurants, and they do serve a big portion.

Overall, the place can get really busy, but it is good for big groups."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. We came for happy hour. Street tacos were very good. Also had the seafood crisp. Very good!  We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour specials. You've gotta sit in the bar to get happy hour food. My faves off of the HH menu are the chorizo tacos and the chicken taquitos. Get here before 5pm to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"First time ever coming here. The first thing I noticed was the beautiful atmosphere and decorations. The food was really great, and I don't say that lightly about Mexican food. The only thing is the wait time for us to put in our order was a little long, perhaps because it was Friday. However the customer service was great, and the manager even gave us free dessert at the end! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great find. Thank you Yelp reviewers. Chile rellenos were a hit, plain and seafood variety. Burritos were a huge hit with the men in the group. Servers were efficient and friendly. Definitely a hit with our group. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly enough I actually have to give my used to be favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas a 1 star rating. I have been going to Mercado's for years, even at the old location on Rainbow (which I must say was WAY better than the new one). Ate here last night. First off, the server, Alfredo was very unfriendly and rude. My order of plain cheese enchiladas was wrong because I asked for green sauce instead of red. He grabbed the plate off the table and acted disgusted that I wouldn't eat what was given to me, wrong order or right order. The rice was cold and hard. I was not trying to chip a tooth! The salt on the margarita was slim pickings and whatever salt was on there fell off on the table as soon as the waiter slide it on the table. Next when we got our bill, the prices were higher and different than the ones on the menu. I would like to point out that both of our menus reflected these prices: The combo plates showed as 9.95, 12.95, 14.95 on our menu and I noticed the Brunch price was 14.95. When we brought this to Alfredo's attention he basically called us liars and then went to the register to grab menus to prove to us that he was right. I could see him fumbling through menus to find the ones with the prices that we were charged and higher. What I am thinking was they updated their menus with new pricing and maybe gave us an older menu. The menu he brought over showed the combo plates at being 12.95, 15.95 and 17.95 and the brunch at 15.95. He then proceeded to tell us that the menus were never updated or that the prices had never been increased. 

It's not about the 1-item combo plate being 12.95 versus 9.95 on our menu, but the fact that they basically called us liars. I know what I saw on the menu and I am not blind. Talked to the manager, I think that's who he is and all he says, \"well I'll have to find those menus!\" Are you kidding me? Bad customer service. Our entire family will never eat here again because of the service."}
{"text":"My last visit here was horrible. The woman who may been a Manager (short w/black hair and healthy) was very unpleasant. I asked for extra salsa with my dinner and she gave me an unfriendly look and said your meal already comes with it.  I advised I was aware but wanted a small side like I usually get and she stated \"Well you need to pay for it\" in a unprofessional tone.  

I will not return here."}
{"text":"My very favorite Mexican restaurant in southern Nevada! Love the hot bean dip and salsa served with the chips. Fideo soup is delicious. Best chili relleno ever. Excellent service. Reasonable prices. Can't wait to come back down from Reno.....or maybe the Mercado's should open a restaurant in Reno!!"}
{"text":"Good food, GREAT SERVICE, descent prices. All in all 5 stars. Mr. Mercado himself was a stand out guy... Reason being, we wanted to have a good Mexican breakfast while we were in Vegas, found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We had so much trouble getting there and when we did Mr. Mercado felt so bad that he actually offered us a ride back to our hotel, and guess what, he actually took us back to our hotel. You have to stop in and say hi to the staff as they are fabulous and super friendly, and the food is fantastic! Thanks Mr Mercado, thanks for hooking us up!"}
{"text":"This place was SO GOOD. we loved the seafood taquitos. The service was great. I recommend the peach margarita. I got the fish taco (so delicious), the chicken tamale (a little different since it's more open-faced but it's good!) and the beef burrito (the beef was SO GOOD. Stole the show for me.)

We pretty much decided this is our New Mexican place! I wanna come back tomorrow but I have a lot of leftovers since we ate so much!"}
{"text":"Another Mexican restaurant? Not even close. Great menu with a lot of choices and reasonable prices considering the A+ quality. Sometimes I don't order beef at Mexican restaurants. Here I did. Tender and tasty. Only complaint. Too much food. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Tremendous dinner and service! Ceviche, Chille Rellano and Chipotle Chicken were all fantastic. Thank you."}
{"text":"I really liked the fact that the restaurant carries an extended menu, you could definitely find something you would like to eat. They offered complementary chips, salsa and fried beans, which were pretty good.  I ordered the enchiladas and although they were good, they were not very impressive! I was very disappointed with the margarita, I could not taste any alcohol! ::( the service was decent and the atmosphere is very nice.. Overall, not a bad place but nothing out of the ordinary"}
{"text":"The menu is really good.  There are so many combos.  I had no idea that the place is so big.  (I was never in the other locations.)  The bar looked great, they seem to have a lot of drinks.  Tamales are very good.  They are served differently than I am used to.  The outdoor seating looks nice.  And the service is good and timely.
Okay so I came back!  Food was excellent again.  If you are there during the day Luis the bartender/waiter is very attentive without being overbearing.  The busboys were also very nice also.  I do recommend Viva Mercado."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! Everything we ordered was out of this world! The margaritas were AMAZING & STRONG, exactly how we asked for. The staff was wonderful and I loved the atmosphere. I especially liked their prices! $9 for an Avion margarita! Can't beat that! This is my new Mexican spot =)"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley.  Authentic dishes.  Great flavor. Amazing service. Birria on a Sunday morning is the sure fix for Saturday nights sheninigans."}
{"text":"Once again true to you comes through again! Daughter and I came for happy hour margaritas and menu enough for the both of us! Love the bar area no kids just two adults needing time for us! The staff was great friendly and right on with everything! She had fideo soup I had pasole both were delicious just perfect with what we ordered! She had street tacos carne asada I had tacos abrado looking forward for a brunch weekend  seen a few friends we haven't seen in awhile this is the place for a good Mexican food nite out! We're always coming back!"}
{"text":"It's okay not my favorite. We waited too long for our lunch to come out again. The house margaritas are good. Not coming back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Mexican food spots in town!  Great service, great food, and it's not overly pricey.  

The chips are standard but the bean dip and salsa are awesome.  I personally like the kind of salsa they provide.  There are some good dishes here, the Boracha, Chile Verde enchiladas, fish tacos (Basso instead of Tilapia), chicken fajitas and even the combo dinners are good picks.

For dessert, the churros and flan are my picks here."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I love checking out new restaurants, so I gave this one a shot a few months ago. I had high hopes as it was a beautiful restaurant and was very busy, but I ordered to go and was very disappointed. The food was bland and while I was waiting for my food to come out I witnessed something completely unacceptable. One of the kitchen staff came out and asked one of the take-out staff IF I HAD TIPPED while I was in sight and earshot!!! I am glad I did tip, who knows what would've been done to my food otherwise. Working in a service based facility, I know very well that this is common conversation among colleagues, but this should never be discussed in the presence of a guest. 
Because of the staff's tackiness and underwhelming flavor of the food, I will not return.
I only gave two stars because the facility is beautiful and their salsa wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Always Great Service, Friendly atmosphere, waiters and bus person call you My Friend! 
Great Chips and salsa, grilled onions and chiles and of course the soap is the best!"}
{"text":"Exemplary service, great food, wonderful ambiance. We couldn't find fault at all. Best sit-down Mexican so far in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Big portions, starts off with chips, bean dip and salsa plus a delightful tomato soup! And and with a complimentary dessert of cinnamon sugar chips and whiped cream drizzled with carmel and chocolate."}
{"text":"Great food and great margaritas! They have an excellent salsa selection, that include some very hot salsas that are not always easy to come by at restaurants. The sautéed peppers and onions that also come as a complementary dish are a nice alternative. The service here has always been fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. I'm from SoCal and this is THE best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Period! The food is amazing! We had a small issue with our order tonight but not a big deal. I just wanted to thank the management staff for taking such a concern with it. It was not necessary but you can tell that they truly value their customers. A tip of the cap. Yes, mistakes are going to happen in a busy restaurant. No ones fault. Not a big deal. We will continue to come back. We support this locally owned family business. We highly recommend this Mexican restaurant.  If you don't like the food here, you don't like Mexican food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The place is so cute,, it's really open and you can see just about everywhere from anywhere.  The guacamole is to die for it was creamy not just chunky.  My fajitas were fresh and I like how they don't over cook the veggies like most places. They have these sauteed jalapenos that are super yum and taste like it would be perfect with a cold beer! Unfortunately I had to go back to work so the next time!   I need to come back for their happy hour!   And the bartender was pretty hot! Lol!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Place was fairly empty besides a few tables (like 4) occupied. My husband and I ordered a pretty simple meal 1 item combo and I a chicken tostada salad, and guac as an appetizer. Our waiter Lino was super nice but disappeared for a long time after he took our drink orders. About 10 mins go by and we get our drinks. But no guac. That's fine. Another 10 mins go by still no guac. Then right before we get our entrées the guac finally arrives. So I take a few bites of my salad and suddenly I bite down on a hard piece of \"something\" so I take it out of my mouth thinking it's probably a piece of chicken or hard piece of lettuce. Well to my surprise it's a piece of wax paper. Not a small piece but about 2 inches long yellow piece of wax paper. The kind of paper you get your tortillas wrapped in.  So again our nice waiter is no where be found. I get up and go to the hostesses to explain and tell her I just want a new salad. She's apologetic and takes my food. Minutes later our nice waiter comes by and apologizes I tell him I just want a new salad and not to worry. Well... like 10 minutes go by when I finally get my salad and by this time my husband is done with his dinner and I'm just over it. What am I going to do eat my meal while my husband watches me since he's long done wafting?? We ask for our check and more minutes go by like 5 minutes and my husband has to go find Lino to get our check. Well he claims he was \"fixing\" our check. Of course he didn't charge us for the salad. Thank goodness. The service was horrible and my food well what I ate of it was ok until the wax paper hurt my tooth. So not coming back here again.  It's sad because this was my favorite place since they were in the Rainbow location."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday with my family and friends to give Viva Mercado's a try after seeing the great Yelp reviews. Let me tell you that our food was AMAZING!! Service was OUTSTANDING!! Location was Great! 

We ordered the nachos with chicken as our appetizer .So awesome! Next came our main courses and my enchiladas with rice and beans were so delicious it reminded me of fresh Mexican food back home in Ca. Ingredients were fresh, the cheese was melted so perfectly and the red sauce tasted so good and authentic. In fact everybody was extremely pleased with their dishes. We just couldn't stop complimenting our food it was just that good!

Even though very full and extremely satisfied we opted for 2 orders of the fried ice cream for desert to be shared amongst us all. Why did it have to be so perfect?! Why?! 

 We all came to the conclusion that we have found our NEW favorite Mexican restaurant as our go to spot for a very tasty authentic Mexican meal. 

I Highly Recommend Viva Mercado's Mexican Bar and Grill for The Next Time You Crave REALLY GOOD Mexican Food! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"So good!! Loved the service and you get a lot for what you pay. I had the guacamole tacos with rice and beans. So tasty!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is abundant and delicious. I had the Parrillara, stuffed myself silly and took home half. Chips, bean sauce, salsa and guacamole were the starters. Good selection of tequilas for margaritas or straight."}
{"text":"The food was very good. They offer different salsas but you must ask. I had taco salad. Yummy! Margaritas on happy hour $5. Service is always good here. Ben there many times. The owners are there everyday. They even gave us a free dessert. ! Cinnamon crisps. ! Yum!"}
{"text":"Everything here is hands down the best! The waiters, the margaritas, chile rellenos, the chips/salsa/fried jalepenos/beans and everything else we've eaten (we've tried a lot). It hits the spot every time!"}
{"text":"Nice place, excellent food.  We went for lunch with a party of 5 last Saturday.  We were seated right away and they brought drinks and chips/salsa promptly.  The food was excellent and obviously homemade, with ginormous portions.  The reason I pulled a star is that it was 45 mins from when we finished our appetizers to when they brought out the main course.  The waiter apologized several times, and I know the dishes were hand made, but by the time they came out, we were no longer hungry (chips/salsa).  We basically boxed everything up and left.  Overall, good place to eat."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Las Vegas. Been going there for years. We love the service and food. Awesome atmosphere and people."}
{"text":"Horrible first and last experience went with a group of 12 ppl and waited 40! Minutes for someone to take our drink order then as I'm sitting after I get my water the \"owner\" is at our table and throws a shirt and tips the water over and covers my IPhone.. I calmly pick up my phone and dry it he ignores it and doesn't even cater to bringing towels for the water spill. So my friend speaks up and tells him that he covered my phone in water and my screen at this point is turning green from the water. He looks at my phone and says sorry it was an accident and I told him no worries I understood calmly stuff happens I'm not worried about the phone.. then he proceeded to tell me after it doesn't mater cause the phone is still useable and it doesn't matter about the green on the screen and it wasn't his \"problem\" at this point I'm getting pissed and another manager comes over and is very polite and takes care of it and send the \"owner\" on his way. She asked me do I need anything at all I asked for my drink I ordered 45+ minutes ago and she says yes and brings me the wrong drink then says she gave me a better one.. I ignore it and just drink it anyway. So by this time my phone screen is not working and the touch is not active anymore... never got an apology from the gentlemen that did the damage or anything other then told it's not his problem that he threw a shirt at our table unprofessionally and ruined my phone. So because the fact I decided to go eat there it cost me 175$ to insurnce claim my phone for a new one.. on top of that I'm greeted with a bill for my 20$ burrito and on top of that with the drink I was given that I didn't order placed on my buddy's bill.. Worst customer service ever! Understand accidents happen and it was buisy due to the night but it wasn't my fault this employee/owner decided to throw a shirt at a table where no one was paying attention to him. Then told it's not my fault here's your bill.  never again will I go or return with anyone or recommend it."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday- and we loved it! Edgar was an awesome waiter and was always available/ checking up on us. He even celebrated my boyfriends birthday by brining out a hat, desert, and other employees to sing to him without having me to ask! Every single person in the restaurant was nice and had great customer service. They even accommodated our choice of tv- had to watch the NBA finals OKC vs WARRIORS. 

Drinks: Happy hour is awesome! It's 3-7p only on the bar, bar seating area, and outside patio. We had some yummy margaritas for $5 each. 

Food: 5 star- very authentic! From the grilled onions that are served with the chip, the soup, to the 2 choice meat fajitas for two (we had shrimp and steak)! Very delicious! 

Total meal: $51 plus a generous tip because we loved it so much! 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't had excellent Mexican meal in a long time here in Las Vegas. This is a hidden gem. They even brought our toddler complimentary food when we arrived so she wouldn't have to wait too long before her dinner came. They also gave us a complimentary surprise dessert as we were paying the bill. The staff was incredibly kind, friendly and the service was overall excellent."}
{"text":"I first came here with coworkers for lunch and we eventually continued to come here for our Mexican food fix. The waiters are very attentive and spoiled us with their delicious chips & salsa. The waiters do not hesitate to give us more chips after we finish our first basket. The food was fresh and fairly priced for the portion. The tables & silverware were clean and the ambience is very casual. I can imagine this place great for birthday celebration. I will definitely be coming back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"One of our top rated Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  I was very happy when I found out they were opening once again at this new location.  Staff has always been attentive and nice.  Salsa choices are excellent.  When I'm adventurous and try a new item from the extensive menu, it's always tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! And the service was excellent. I was so crushed when they closed the restaurant down, but when I heard that they were open for business again I was extremely excited! The new location is fresh and modern with the same great tasting food! The margarita was so good! They used Organic tequila!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I have been eating here for years. 

The service is superb and the food is outstanding. They've definitely gained a lifelong diner with me."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! 20 minutes no waiter!! 30 minutes and no food!! Really??? The restaurant wasn't even busy. Crazy thing is no one cared. Not the water boy, not the hostess NO ONE! Being  I'm in the restaurant industry I don't really understand this. My kids were starting to get upset and we ask another server if they forgot our food... she says they are working on it now. So now it's 40 minutes and we left!!! Funny thing is they chased us out to say it's gonna come out now!!! YEA RIGHT!! To bad I really liked this place!! Never ever coming back!!!"}
{"text":"It was OK definitely not a fan of the $15  tacos. For tacos. Seriously. But they were awesome. And food taste was good. Just a bit over priced for small meals"}
{"text":"Made reservations and still didn't get seated for an hour AFTER the reservation. Now, been sitting here for 55 more minutes, and food JUST got here. Could be the best food in the world, and I would come back. Service was very subpar. 1.3/7 would not running again."}
{"text":"Came in to treat my wife for a Mother's Day lunch.  Unfortunately after waiting for about twenty minutes, we had the bowl of chips finished off and drinks almost empty, no one had been by to take our food order.  They weren't that busy.  We decided not to order after waiting a few minutes longer our waiter finally came by to take our order, I told him just charge us for the drinks and chips so we could go somewhere else.  We weren't charged."}
{"text":"I WISH I COULD GIVE 10 STARS!! Absolutely love this place. The first thing that drew me in and made me place an order was the staff! They went above and beyond to answer all my questions about my food needs. I cannot have gluten or dairy and they totally understood. So catering to my needs and I can't wait to go back!!!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and everytime the staff makes me feel welcome. The drink specials are awesomeness. The food is A++++ real mexican food.  Happy hour is the best time to come .. because the drinks are goooood"}
{"text":"My husband comes from LA and is Hispanic, so when it comes to Mexican food, he can be picky. This restaurant passed with flying colors! Like other reviewers have noted, the chips and salsa were fantastic. The fideo soup that came with our meals was also a favorite. My husband said it reminded him of soup his mother made on cold days at home. Our entrees were plentiful and tasty and we appreciated the sweet treat at the end.

Apart from the delicious food, I think what made this place awesome was the service. It was the fastest I've ever had, super friendly, and on point. My husband even did a small test by downing is soda right after it was refilled. Within 10 seconds someone had come to refill it. Everyone who passed by were helping with refills, whether it be drinks or chips and salsa, little waiter things, and even the bill. Instead of one waiter we had a village and it made a pleasant experience. Thanks Viva Mexicana!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on my own after work and I felt very welcomed. They serve chips with grill onions n beans dip. Very interesting. I ordered a mango margarita that was one of the best one I ever had! Food was delicious!! I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I waited outside with a group of six for over an hour. We then waited another hour before we were served. They were good about bringing chips and topping off ours drinks, but by the time we got we our food we where full on chips and drinks. Once the food arrived we were disappointed with the lack of flavor and freshness. Super long wait for food that wasn't worth waiting for.  Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great place and fun time! I'm the most picky person about service, they are absolutely great!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! I found the food there to be particularly flavorful! Like most Americans, I've eaten my fair share of burritos. I have to say that there was something different and more flavorful about Viva Mercados.

In addition to the dishes, I really love their chips! Oh, and the sauces that come with them! Mmmmmmmm. I can't stop myself from shoving my face.

I also really have liked the service there. The waiters and waitresses are particularly friendly and patient. There's just something a little bit better at Viva Mercados."}
{"text":"This establishment used to be an institution on Jones and Flamingo. They have changed locations a couple of times since then and now are located in Village Square on the NWC of Sahara and Fort Apache."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and the food. The queson fondit odious is a must try and very good. We also had quesadillas and they were huge and very good. You definitely get your money's worth of food, but due to this the prices are a little excessive. The waiter did give us a yummy dessert on the house and that was pretty awesome. The service and food are definitely worth a trip, but be ready to pay premium prices. Had the prices been a little less they would have gotten a full five stars. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was super interesting. I was used to the location on rainbow but they moved this location! 
Do. Not come here if you're short on time. It took me about 3 hours to eat here LOL. When we first came in our server was attentive and served our needs and even hooked it up with our margaritas. After 1.5 hours he was no where to be found so we could place our actual order and grab the bill! Everything is a bit overpriced for Mexican food but the portions are freaking enormous!!!!! They also give you free chips, salsa, and bean dip which ruined my meal LOL but I got to take home a massive burrito to eat for the next two days! Overall I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am really surprised that this place receives such high marks.  It just was very mediocre as far as Mexican food goes.  For one, I am not sure if it was hotter outside or inside the restaurant (it was only 105 outside).  Literally started to sweat before I had even sat down.  Maybe their AC was out, not sure, but Wow!  I guess we were getting the full Vegas experience.  

The chips and salsa were decent, but the food itself was very mediocre.  If you go to this place, you could do worse, but certainly this is not a five start on yelp kind of place."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the strip mall location! Welcome back to old Mexico at this Summerlin find. The margaritas were tasty and reasonably priced. The chips were warm and crunchy, and the salsa had just the perfect touch of oregano. The sopa fideo is just like my mother-in-law makes. My pollo chile chipotle con crema was to die for, and it was all topped off with buñuelo with caramel and whipped cream. It was all so yummy, and the service was impeccable. What a great find! I wish we had a Viva Mercado back in Thousand Oaks, CA!"}
{"text":"After a morning of hiking in Red Rock Canyon we were looking for some grub and Mexican food was the craving.  Our Yelpers did not let us down on the recommendation for Viva Mercados.  We like, no love, Mexican food.   This restaurant has the goods.  Generous serving of salsa and chips to start (if you like hot like I do, request some of the hot - habanero - on the side, super tasty).  Salsa was excellent.  Service was on point.  Overall the food was delicious.   Don't pass up an opportunity to try this hidden gem.  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice. Both times the customer service was excellent! The food was even better. There bean dip is amazing!! I had there carne asada burito enchilada style and it was yummy, i ate the whole thing! Ive had there enchilada before too which was tasty. My sister had the tacos and she said it was very good too. They have a complimentary dessert which tastes super good. If your craving mexican food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sooooo let me tell y'all, I love Mexican food.  & this place def have the atmosphere for some good Mexican food. I went in here on my mother'a day for brunch with my family & immediately we got greeted & got seated in a nice comfortable booth. & wow the food menu was big & every item sounded super good so I had to order my favorite chicken fajitas & it was delicious. Also I had a strawberry mimosa. I was full within 5 mins haha food portions are def huge & filling. Appetizers are also very good. Im giving this place 5 Stars because this spot is a authentic Mexican restaurant & had great service & I had a great Time."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze - they always pay attention to the little details that can take an all right meal and turn it into something awesome. Last night I brought in a party of 20-25 people and they took amazing care of us - although there was some confusion when it came down to breaking up the checks - a word to the wise; if you have a big party make sure everyone brings some cash or you will have a headache. I've had the pleasure of trying out a couple of their steak dishes now - each one has been absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly, with just the right balance of salty, spicy, and juicy. I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Service was great. Staff was friendly and attentive from the hostess stand to the servers, bussers and bar staff. 

Only ate a chicken burrito, so my sample is not large, but the food was only ok. It was fresh and good, but not meeting my expectations for an American style Mexican restaurant. 

Margarita was ok. A little too creative with the cucumber and all. 

Prices are a bit steep, as well. But when in Summerlin..."}
{"text":"We received great service from Luis and others. I liked the vibration of the staff and location. 
We ordered from the lunch menu, and while the food was good, it just was not great, too much sauce on the items, and no really great salsa to go with the chips. I tried several, but they were all either too sweet, or too spicy, but not one that was just great. I prefer a spicy chunky salsa.

I have been spoiled by Leticia's and Juan's Flaming Fajitas so my standards are higher when it comes to quality and flavor. 

I would visit this location again based on the great service throughout the entire visit. They also serve Pepsi products exclusively, which to me, as stated in other reviews is a bad customer service decision."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! Been going to Viva Mercado's since they were in their first location. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to lunch or dinner there!"}
{"text":"Busy location so I thought I would try it as I was here from out of town.  Disappointed in guacamole.  1 lb steak burrito was very good and worth the price.   The cocktails looked amazing."}
{"text":"We ended up here randomly on Valentine's Day after not making reservations anywhere and not having much of a plan.  This shopping center has become a great dinner and a movie spot - so many great options now!  This was my first time at Viva Mercado's - I didn't even know there was another location before.  We really enjoyed our food.  I tried mulitas for the first time (sort of like a soft tostada layered with toppings, like a fried but soft corn tortilla with beans, and I had it with carnitas).  It came with great quality queso fresco and other toppings, and it was really tasty.  I really loved how they bring out the fried jalapenos and onions upon request.  We enjoyed putting them on chips with the bean dip and salsa (complimentary) and also I added some to spice up my food.  

My husband had some sort of seafood dish.  I don't remember the name of it, but it was a huge saucy plate with fish, shrimp, peppers, etc., and with a second plate of beans and rice on the side, and a side of tortillas.  I laughed when his 3 plates of food came out as his single dinner plate!  

I didn't love my margarita - it was a house margarita and a little sweet for me (maybe too much triple sec or mix, if they use a mix), so I would definitely splurge on a more specialized one next time.  They have a huge margarita menu, so I will need to try something different.  But I won't hold that against them.  My mistake for choosing the plain house margarita.    

They brought us a cute cupcake for Valentine's Day at the end of our meal - a very nice touch for a restaurant with casual food and lower prices, when we didn't order dessert.  :)  

I should note the menu is huge.   It has to be 10 pages.  At first I said, \"I love this!  Lots of choices!\"  But after about 5 minutes of reading the menu, I felt a little overwhelmed and was actually laughing - so much food to choose from!  I do appreciate that though - it is unfortunate that to so many people, Mexican food is a taco, enchilada, or burrito when there are so many more authentic dishes!  So here, you can find them all, and then some.  I was happy to try something new.  

We usually go to Macayo for sit-down (not take out) Mexican food, but I think this will be our new Mexican spot - closer to home and the food seems better.  I will update and comment after we try this with our kids.  :)"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for Bobby to reopen his restaurant since they closed. I'm glad they are open again and we can enjoy some of the finest Mexican food in Vegas!  They've only been open a week and you can tell they're working a few links out, but for the most part, they are back up to speed with the old place. I highly recommend you check this place out if you are looking for honest, straightforward Mexican cuisine with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Place was decent but the margaritas were too sweet and the salsa wasn't that great. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were not good at all but the tamale was. Don't get the green sauce it's very bitter and ruined the tamale. This place is better than macayos though."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to. The salsa they bring out with the chips is Amazing. I could eat the whole chips and salsa on my own! I ordered the chicken enchilada , filled with great flavors. Service was great, our server came by plenty of times to make sure we were doing okay. Definitely would recommend this place if you are craving Mexican !! They do get busy so I would either call ahead or be prepared to wait a little."}
{"text":"The most amazing Mexican food and service on the West Coast! The Chimichanga de Mariscos, carne quesadilla, and queso fundido top our list of favoritos! Bartender Brendan, rocks! Cheers"}
{"text":"I can't remember the name of what I had, but there are vegetarian options here, and they are yummy.  I didn't plan on having dessert, but the bartender suggested something that I'd never had before so I sprung for it.  It was very cinnamon-y and I enjoyed it.  The bartender was super nice, too.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall and you don't think much of it until you walk inside and then the place is very large. I went there for my birthday and the place was very accommodating with awesom friendly service.  I had the best chili Riano in my life.  Huge portion great food great place"}
{"text":"Worst!!!! Barf!!!! Nasty!!!! Wish I had gone to Taco Bell it would have been better and cost less. Zero stars. Frozen Margarita was just slushie lime water, 711 has better slushies for the money. Never again. I paid the bill because it is illegal to dine and ditch. I also tipped the waiter, as he was nice and it wasn't his fault the food was less than sub par."}
{"text":"They have an awesome happy hour, with refreshing margaritas and some appetizers. Their tamarind margarita is tart and thirst-quenching, so make sure to try that on your next visit. I can tell you that their regular menu is pricey, but their dishes are large enough to share (2 ppl), and they are very tasty. 

Perhaps the best part about Viva Mercados is their staff. They are always happy, super friendly, and always willing to go the extra mile for you. Have a taste of a margarita? Sure!, keep your drinks and chips filled to brim? Absolutely. 

Come visit this restaurant and buen provecho!"}
{"text":"5 stars for living up to the 4.5 star Yelp rating!  This place is close to home so we finally stepped out of our norm and tried it.  Totally satisfied.   I had the carne asada chimichanga.. One word, awesome!    My husband had the carnitas plate, the carnitas was in slices (versus shredded like we are used to) so we were skeptical, but it was so moist & tender and not greasy at all.  We will definitely be back for every Mexican craving we have lol.   Only suggestion would be to add \"baños\" to the bathroom sign to top off the good Mexican vibes!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The service was amazing and just what we needed. Our drinks were always filled and our chips and salsa was always filled. The servers were on top of it! They weren't pushy but made sure we weren't lacking. 

The food. We ordered two three combination dishes and two tamales. Every single thing was amazing. My favorite was the pork enchilada and the chicken tamale. The sauces were slightly spicy but perfect. The cheese was actually melted in the enchilada. If you get cheese enchiladas a lot then you know most of the time the cheese inside is not melted. 

We will be back. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour. The sangria is probably one of the best in town. They have a small area outside which is great to sit in on a nice day. You can even have happy hour specials out there. 

The food is always delicious. I usually order the same thing every time. The biggest bowl of guacamole, enchiladas, fajitas, chili relleno. The tortillas taste like they are homemade. 

But be warned, if you get the burrito, that thing seriously weighs as much a small child. There is no way a normal person could finish it. When we do get this, we always eat half and box up the rest for the homeless. 

I also like the fact that there are always the same locals hanging out in here. It's nice to see the same people all the time, you know the food must be good."}
{"text":"It was a spot for our family until they served me my order of mole with frozen chicken.  It was cooked but it was a frozen chicken breast.  Even after I got it, examined it and even took a bite out of it; I couldn't believe it.  The last nine times we were there the chicken mole was made from a real chicken breast plus some. 
So, I asked the waiter that there was something definitely wrong with my chicken mole and it's not what I'm paying for. He said that he will ask the cook about the frozen chicken. At first the Cook said, that it's always served with a frozen chicken and the last times I've ordered the chicken mole, I must have not been paying attention.  I said it's sad that you think of me that poorly, but I was pretty sure he was wrong. Then, I told him that I had yelped this place before with pictures of the mole not served with a frozen chicken; I started looking through my phone, then he apologized that he just remembered that just recently they started using frozen chicken on the mole. My waiter was definitely embarrassed of his remarks, apologizing for that, then telling us that he was going to remove the mole off our bill. He asked me if I wanted anything else to eat, I said no. I'd rather get Taco Bell on the way home than spend anymore money than I had already spent here. 

Experience was horrific, like the food."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, had the Chicken Tacos and the deCocktail DeCammorn!  The  was outstanding, our chip basket never got empty and our drinks were refilled continually !"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, was not a fan of the former location at Rainbow/Spring Mtn because of service issues.  The reopened spot at Sahara/Ft Apache does a good job of delivering on service, atmosphere, and flavor.  Not the best Mexican food, but they do a solid job of making tasty dishes.  Before the meal they offer complimentary chips/beans/salsa.  The chips could use some help; they taste like a bag of grocery store chips; definitely not made fresh in house.  They offer additional salsa flavors for $2.5 each, but we just stuck to the original.

I opted for the chile relleno and he had the rajas con crema with chicken.  Both were good.  Before the meal we tried the queso, which proved to be quite a challenge to eat.  The cheese was stringy and greasy, not like a dip.  

The atmosphere is cute, contemporary, and very clean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were heartbroken when our favorite Mexican restaurant closed. How exciting it is to have Viva Mercado's back and better than ever! The new location is absolutely beautiful inside, and still offers the same friendly atmosphere, like you are eating at a friends house. Service is kind and attentive. Now the best part.....the food!

The complimentary chips, salsas, and bean dip, are always a winner! :)

Apps:

Queso Fundido - Yum! This ooey gooey dish is so tasty! Definitely messy, but that just makes it more fun to eat. 

Chili Con Queso - This was a bit spicy for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. However, I found that I kept eating it despite the spice, so it must have been good! lol

Guacamole - One of my fave things on the menu! Super fresh and delicious, my boyfriend is lucky if he gets any at all!

Main Dishes:

I have tried most of the dishes available for the combination platters, and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all! One of my favorite parts is the sopa de fideos. I don't know what it is about this simple soup, but I love it! 

If I had to chose my favorites, it would definitely be the crispy shredded beef tacos and the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. They are definitely my two go to dishes here. The chili verde is very good as well.....and the tamales......and the burritos....and the tostadas......I could go on and on and on! 

Dessert:

We don't always make it to dessert, which is a shame because the churros, fried ice cream, and sopapillas are all wonderful!"}
{"text":"We loved this place since they were located next to the Smith's on Flamingo, small intimate, but then they expanded to their location on Spring Mountain, it was big and very nicely decorated but they closed up even though it always appeared to be busy, we thought they were gone for good, but then we discovered their newest location at Village square and are enjoying once again great food and service. 

I love the happy hour, who doesnt love margaritta's! They serve roasted onions and jalapena with radish, soup with the meal and they gave us complmentary desert. 

I chose the combination plate, chili relleno, beef taco and chili verde enchilada. It was very good. My husband got a steak it was grilled and very tender! It was a good meal. Always good food great service and good margaritta's!"}
{"text":"Chips,  salsa,  peppers,  onions,  beans,  Guacamole all complementary.  All no dairy or chicken broth used,  vegaterian vegan friendly.  

The extra grilled jalapeño peppers are Delish.  

Happy hr 3-6pm every day,  free chips and Salsa and 5$ menu

We ordered the tacos with Guacamole no cheese  on T was okay but very heavy.  


Service is good. Very quick food delivery."}
{"text":"I believe they have three locations but this was the best location customer service is amazing the food is amazing and you'll definitely have a good time we loved our food we order the 13th and the fish platter and it was amazing and people are in there are very friendly they have the best margaritas ever"}
{"text":"This place has some great Mexican food. Everything is fresh and tastes homemade.  The staff is friendly and take care of you right away. I was hesitant to get the tomales, because I never can find good ones at restaurants, but after eating there once and being so impressed with their dishes, I decided to try the beef tomales with red sauce and they were great! They were really moist and tasted like my family made them.  This is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this place, plus it's close to home. The food is consistently fabulous, especially their tacos and fun. They are friendly, attentive and especially the bartender Lazaro. They serve great bean dip, ice cold beer on tap...seriously what else do you need! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"My first time eating take out from this place I'm not sure if maybe the food would of been better eating in. I was really in the mood for ceviche for some reason . For the people who know me I hardly ever crave mexican food and on a even rarer occasion I actually eat it from a restaurant for this reason I'm always disappointed! I feel like the ceviche was such a let down  it had absolutely no flavor it was simply a mixture of shrimp and a bunch of onions with squid . I did get three limes on the side and tapatio packets wich I loaded the toastas with wich by the way we're all broken. I also order a tinga sope wich was a load of oil there was so much freeze that one bite was enough for me . The camarones en mojo were spicy as hell im not sure if they mixed my order but my bf can't eat spicy so his dinner was a waste . I think for 50$ worth of food it was a complete waste /: even the guacamole was flavorless idk how you mess that up. Sorry but the only reason they got three stars was because they delivered it pretty quick ."}
{"text":"Great place! The chips and salsa/bean dip are exactly what they should be at a Mexican place. And they gave us free desert!"}
{"text":"Put in an order for pickup this evening.  Have to say I'm not impressed.  When the best thing is the fideo soup you get for free with everything it's not a good sign.  Firstly when we got home we discovered part of the order was wrong.  We did not return it because we were hungry and didn't want to drive back down there.
The salsa they give you with the chips is sweet,  I saw one person on here describe it as tasting like spaghetti sauce and I would have to agree.  No flavor of onions, cilantro or Chile only sweet tomatoes kinda sad.
The green Chile pork burrito I had was very light on the meat and was nothing but a few pieces of fairly bland pork with on ok green tomatillo sauce.
Overall, very underwhelming.  Not sure I'd go back based on this."}
{"text":"We've been here so many times, and it's always great. I am a big fan of their carne asada, and their carne asada quesadilla is probably the best thing I can eat on this earth! Their menu is extensive, so I really need to try some new dishes instead of falling back on my old favorite. But it's so....good. Anyways, my husband loves their chile rellenos, and my daughter is a burrito fan, and we are never disappointed. Service is always great, my lack of a star is only because the acoustics in the new location really makes it seem loud in there, unless I've just had a bad recent trip or two, and the prices are a wee bit high, but the food quality is so consistently good, it's hard to complain."}
{"text":"my husband and I live near the old location on spring mtn and rainbow. we always drove by the place and wondered what happened to the restaurant. I did some research and found out what happened and the back story.

saw all the great reviews and decided to check it out tonight while we had a friend visiting. atmosphere was great, food was great, we got most of the things on the happy hour menu. I got beef sopes and my husband and his friend got the chicken tacos. husband's friend got 2 beers and then we had 2 margaritas each.

When we got our bill we were charged for 5 margaritas, we told our waiter about it and he apologized and said he'd get it fix. Next thing you know the manager came over and pretty much interrogated us about why we were only going to pay for 4 margaritas and not the fifth one. 

We definitely didn't like the manager's attitude about the situation then he stood with the waiter only a table away from us, in front of other guests, and argue with each other about what had happened. 

Not sure if we'll go back, but hopefully the experience will be a little bit better next time."}
{"text":"My parents and I had an itch for Mexican food, and I'm SO glad I found Viva Mercado.  After reading many positive reviews on Yelp, I knew this place had to be great.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly waiter.  He quickly took and brought out our drink orders and shortly thereafter a busser brought us waters, chips, salsa, and bean dip.  Yum!  The waiter also asked if we liked roasted onions and jalapenos, which my mom eagerly said yes.  So lovely!  Our main dishes were also delicious and we couldn't have been happier.  Large portions, so you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day.

The final touch?  The waiter brought out Bunuelos (cinnamon crisps) with chocolate and whipped cream as a small treat.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Consistent service & food! We absolutely love the waiters & busboys every time we come in; they are friendly, accommodating and this trip brought us grilled veggies to try! The soup is fantastic & our food is always delicious. The only thing that keeps this from a 5 star is dessert. The fried ice cream is only available with caramel ice cream. If they had plain vanilla we would absolutely give it a 5! Definite date night rotation!"}
{"text":"\"Good food. Good service. Clean and nice.\"

That was my dad's concise review but I will expand a little. Our family ate at Viva Mercado for our Sunday meal this week. I was most impressed by the service. The waiters and bussers were moving quickly around the room without pause to assist every patron. I always measure a restaurant based on how quickly they refill my water because I drink lots of it, especially with spicy food. I was never left wanting at Viva Mercado, I was continuously checked on and brought water, napkins, more chips, etc. 

The meal comes with chips, salsa, and bean dip, all very tasty. The prices are a little higher than what I would normally pay for this type of food but so worth it for the service and all the little extras you get. My meal was simple, just a chicken quesadilla, but delicious and the chicken was nicely seasoned. 

The meal was followed with a delightful little dessert course of a crisped tortilla with cinnamon sugar, drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream. So yummy."}
{"text":"This place gives me the feeling of Mexico. With the woman looking traditional uniform and the men looking proper. I like that I got soup and chips as an appetizer. Such a classic and I love it.


But unfortunately, there was several problems with my other time coming. It's not like how I remember it. Hopefully it's just maybe a new staff might be in training. Who knows, hopefully one day there might be a possible way the servers might write down information that is given to them. Especially when taking orders. But I'm sure it might be a common mistake. But then, the unthinkable happen. I asked for corn tortillas. But instead, I got flour, twice! Now, don't get wrong. The food was ok. Just need work on staff and maybe having some nice waitresses to take orders with notepads. So no one will forget. 

I noticed and read others reviews. Also the manager/owner leaves pretty nasty replied comments. That is terrifying. Especially a place I want to come back to."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, nice service but there food is extremely salty. Will not be coming in again"}
{"text":"Just ate here with a couple of my friends. Never heard of this place until one of them told me about it. What a tremendous establishment. Everyone was so nice. Our waiter was the best. Friendly people, excellent ambience, terrific food, etc. You can't go wrong with Viva Mercados. Highly recommended! It's also in a great strip mall. 

5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Very fast, very prompt service. Never had to wait for anything whether it be chips and salsa, or for them to clear an empty plate. Fastest service we've ever had and everyone was very polite. Only thing I think I can say a minor negative thing about was the margaritas we ordered which were peach and mango were a little on the lighter side, couldn't taste the tequila really but that's all the bartender, not the restaurant. Food was excellent, not greasy. I would recommend highly"}
{"text":"Wow so happy...had the best skinny margarita with casamigos, grilled onions with serranos, chips with excellent salsa and beans.  2 crispy flavorful chicken tacos  and a shrimp quesadilla- I'm in heaven!!!  Everything was so good and service was absolutely excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican place in the Vegas Summerlin area. Fresh food and great service."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for the first time today. What can I say? The best Mexican cuisine in all of Las Vegas. Great food, incredible service and a family friendly restaurant. They are so accommodating to my little three year old son. We will coming here very soon. Our waiter Leno was the best."}
{"text":"Great place great food! Been coming to the new place for awhile now and will continue! Get the flash fried tacos!"}
{"text":"We came in here for lunch. First I can say that the staff was friendly, prompt and always kept our drinks full (five star for great staff).  
The place was packed so I was hoping It would be great food. 
The one star is for the food. It was not authentic.  Very bland food, rise and beans (from can) were gross and the enchiladas sauce tasted like it was out of a can as well."}
{"text":"I can't stand the long reviews so simply put, food is good, not great. Service is great from the waiters, prices are not. For Mexican food I'd go somewhere else.

My experience: $16.95 for 2 enchiladas, rice, and beans (15.95 for a burrito) is just too much. I ordered from the happy hour menu. I was brought the menu and seated in the \"non-cantina\" area. When I got the bill, I was charged way more than expected so I asked and was told about the super special cantina area/prices. No happy hour for me. I would have rather sat there to begin with but wasn't offered a choice. I live across the street and rather than help me out for the confusion, she stuck the charges and said it was my fault. Horrible hostess, excellent waiter, but for the price, crappy hostess, 2 stars because I won't come back. Bummer because everyone else seemed nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time after a recommendation for my coworker. This location is very easy to get to. From the outside it looks like it's very small, but once you go inside it's very spacious. Everyone was extremely nice and their drinks were amazing. The food was just as good. We're definitely coming back here. My husband even liked it, and he's pretty hard to please."}
{"text":"Central theme:
Best Mexican restaurant we have ever eaten at in our entire lives!!!!!

The full story: 
Most members of our family can't remember the first time they ever ate Mr. Mercado's food. A typical taste first begins even before we walk if not vicariously in utero. Around the table at our most recent visit, we witnessed a third generation initiate of only 11 months experience enlightenment. The menu is massive, the recipes are unique, the friendly service is genuine, the atmosphere is authentic, and the transformation is permanent. Not a believer yet? I challenge you to just take one single bite of a regular taco here and not give the place at least four stars based on that bite alone. Take in to account the salsa selection, the free soup and bean dip (they have a vegetarian bean dip too and are very knowledgeable and accommodating to the diet), the endless chips you never need to ask for more of, the familiar faces that have worked loyally for some variation/location of this restaurant over several decades... this is the restaurant we measure all others against. Those who know, know."}
{"text":"Still the best mole sauce in town.  A little more pricey at its Village Square location but the food is still very good.  Menudo soup is wonderful.  Wide selection of dishes including a good Mexican vegetarian menu.  Dishes popular in Mexico that you don't normally see in the States.   Great ambiance and service.  Generous portions and nice bar.  My favorites are the enchilada poblano, burrito colorado and the chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"After eating at celebrity chef restaurants and buffets for two days in a row, I needed a casual meal away from the strip. I found this place via yelp and absolutely loved it. From the service to the food and the ambience, everything was spot on. My husband and I shared the vegetarian fajitas and it was prefect. 

It is by far the most flavorful vegetarian fajitas I have ever eaten. And veggie fajitas is my goto dish so I know when I eat a real good one. Their complimentary bean dip and the dessert are both very good. All in all this place totally deserves a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Not bad food here!! Service is amazing!! And very large portions so I recommend splitting! The chile reanos stuffed with carne asada  is amazing!!! Chips and salsa with bean dip is complementary and also they give you a small dessert for free as well :) good spot"}
{"text":"Food was great and so
Was the service! Great quality and would highly recommend it! Try the chile relenos it was out of this world"}
{"text":"Love the family staff. They guided me to a very good selection. Very authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Viva Mercado's has the best Mexican food and margarita's! The food is authentic and taste great. Good service and great prices! Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Viva has one of the best happy hours I've been to. The food is amazing the service is great and the atmosphere is always wonderful... I recommend there mango margarita on the rocks, it's a must have for me."}
{"text":"From the outside this restaurant looks small, but you walk in and it is surprisingly large! Great for a big party or a quick lunch with a friend, or anything in between. 

Get a combo meal because it comes with a free cup of delicious noodle soup before hand. 

They offer huge portion sizes (at a low price) for the kids meals, you'll definitely have leftovers for sure! Plus it comes with a free dessert they'll love! 

There is a bar, booths, tables, private party area, fountains, Mexican decor, very well thought out. Good food, good service, can't complain."}
{"text":"I finally visited viva mercados after living next to it for 4 years. I don't know what took me so long. It seems hard to find good and authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. This was comfort food to me. It was very close to the kind of food my grandma makes me for back at home. We went on a Sunday night for my husbands birthday and had a lovely time. There was no wait and the decor is nice and clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for HH deal, and the best part is they have it daily, so you can get some deals on the weekends. I believe it was 3-7p.m. or something like that. 

The house margaritas are $5, and tap beer was $3 or $4? 
I randomly asked if they served Michelada, and they said they can make it even if it's not on the menu. It wasn't the best I've had, but I appreciate them for trying. 

The finger foods are small portions, but a good way of trying some of their food during happy hour deals."}
{"text":"The awesome service we ate outside. Greatday! The lunch was finished with a great dessert we didn't request they found it fried carmel & chocolate tortilla with sugar."}
{"text":"Normally, I would talk about how great, sub par, or downright gross the food is, but for the second time, ordering from here has blown up in my face. No shows for 2 hours... yet again. And I'm not ordering complicated items... ablondigas, which I would imagine is sitting and waiting to be scooped, and chilequiles, with a fried egg. Who knows.... but this goes back to the fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Once I finally gave up on waiting 45 minutes past the delivery time, I see the guy pull in and he looks puzzled, and irritated that he left the store 30 minutes prior and couldn't make it the 1.3 miles in that time.


Edit: and when I checked the voicemail he left me as I told him I already called and cancelled the long overdue order, he says, \"are you talking to me you stupid, effing, beach\" (you do the math)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely not what you'd expect from the outside. What do they say... never judge a book by its cover? It is so roomy and nice on the inside and I was not expecting that at all since it was in a business complex. The decorations were warm and inviting. The hostess sat us down and right away they brought out chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips were fresh and crispy. The salsa was the perfect blend of flavors and spice. I ordered the chimichanga, and my partner got one of each flavor of tamale (beef, pork, and vegetarian). All three tamales tasted amazing. My chimichanga has nice flavor. My only complaint would be that it is a little bit on the pricey end for Mexican food. However, I throughly enjoyed the ambiance of this place and would definitely come back again. I wanted a mariachi band to come play (and I don't even like those) it was just that nice."}
{"text":"We were introduced to Viva Mercado's by friends, and very much enjoyed our dinner here.  Fajitas with Grilled Marinated Steak, Green Chiles, Green Bell Peppers, cilantro, White Onions, and tomatoes topped by Guacamole and Sour Cream sizzled with excellence, and I was pleased to note that the meat sported no fat.  A Shredded Beef Taco with marinated meat on a crisp Corn Tortilla tasted very good with Queso Fresco.  An included accompaniment, Mexican Fried Rice, was okay; and another, Frijoles Refritos, very good. 

A cup of complimentary Fideo Soup was good and hot but arrived at the table late.  Other than this,wait service was good except for one service lapse on drink refills.  The atmosphere of a festive fiesta added authenticity to the locale, and enhanced our enjoyment of the meal.

This is a really long drive from North Las Vegas but I expect that I will be back."}
{"text":"Randomly craving for Tacos and a Margarita, I stumbled on this gem of a place. 

Ladies in the front are sweethearts. I sat at the bar. $5 Margarita, $5 Tacos, free chips with salsa and beans. Bartender is cute and sweet. 

Food was delicious. Finally Guac that taste like GUAC lol

And the bartender gave me a complimentary dessert. I live in the area definitely will be a go to spot for me"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Everything I've gotten has been delicious - carne asada, ceviche, cheese crisps. The staff are really friendly as well. 

I love that you get chips and bean sauce at the table. I usually have to exhibit some self control not to spoil my appetite eating those chips before my main. The only thing that is strange is that I don't see much of a difference between their shrimp ceviche and mariscos.  Both seem to contain mainly shrimp.  Definitely save room for their buñelos, which are cinnamon sugar crisps with whip cream and chocolate sauce."}
{"text":"I was craving tamales and found this place on a Yelp notification highlighting local Mexican restaurants with a great tamales selection.  Something in the highlight made this restaurant stand out.

Viva is located in a strip mall, which I will warn is towards the back corner.  We came in the wrong side of the complex and had to drive around to find it.  From the outside it looks like a fast food place, and I was quick to become reserved about my choice.  The owner greeted us when we walked in.  He actually took the menus from the hostess and seated us himself, which I thought set an excellent tone for our dining experience.  We were immediately asked for a drink selection and the margaritas (@ $7.95 a piece) were recommended.  We chose the strawberry and regular margaritas.  The strawberry was good, the regular margarita was not...don't recommend anyone try it.  :/

The inside of the restaurant doesn't match the outside at all...so don't be judgmental!  The decor is beautiful.  There is a running water feature and traditional Mexican music in the background.

The menu is extensive.  If you are craving it, they probably have it.  There is a whole page of drink options, appetizers and multiple pages of entrees.  I was disappointed in their tamales selection...there was only one and it was on their \"make your own combo\".  They offer a brunch menu on the weekends only.  It had a nice variety and included a small mimosa or margarita.  

The back page of their menu book listed all their homemade salsas.  They offer a sampling of each for a small amount, I think it was like $2.95.  

They bring chips, bean dip and salsa when you are seated.  The chips were standard quality, but fresh and crispy.  The salsa had small pieces of onion, cilantro and pepper in it.  Again not the best I've had, but it was flavorful.  The best part was the plate of grilled jalapeño peppers and onions.  They were AWESOME!  Their Fideo soup was good, but not the most flavorful I have had.  The carne asada quesadilla was very flavorful and large enough for 2 people.  It didn't come with any sides, just a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.   

In summary, not a bad place at all.  I would have preferred to give 3.5 stars.  The service was good, the food was good and the atmosphere very nice.  The prices were pretty high.  Most entrees were $15.95 and up.  For the size of the margaritas I thought $7.95 was a bit much.  So just a heads up that this is a more pricer place to eat.  I heard the owner previously had the Viva location on Rainbow, which closed, so I hope this reincarnated location is more successful."}
{"text":"Service was great, and the Mexican food was top notch. Wife had a shrimp salad...:she was not thrilled, but the Chili Colorado enchiladas were very good, as well as the other more \"traditional\" Mexican food fare."}
{"text":"Wife and I dine out 2-3 times a week so we try lots of places close to our apartment in Summerlin. Viva Mercado is typical of your better South of the Border upscale Tex Mex menu restaurants. Quality is good, service is reasonably quick. For a quick bite of casual food, I could recommend it without a doubt. Unfortunately, I have lived in Mexico and get sticker shock when I get the bill, but that is I common in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had an issue with an order we ordered from Grubhub. It took us two hours to get it resolved. That said, the owner called us personally to apologize and resolve the issue, which I appreciate. Their food is excellent. We are regular customers. Before today I would have given them five stars. However, I am cautiously changing my one star to three in good faith that we will receive better service in the future."}
{"text":"I swear.... Each and every time I come here the food gets better and better. Maybe it the margaritas getting stronger and stronger. Whatever it is they are doing it right. Today I had the Pazole soup. It was very tasty. We has a large party of 12 and they were still on top of the service and all the food came out hot. I always recommend this place for the best Mexican food in Vegas. If you haven't tried it yet, make sure you do! 

Long Live Marcados!"}
{"text":"Ate here in a large family group a week ago.  We sat on the patio and got great service - my daughter asked for extra cherries in her shirley temple and they brought out a whole rocks glass full.  Chips and dips were kept refreshed, with 4 sets for 9 of us.  Carne Asada steak tacos were great.  Wish they had the thin Tortilla chips but otherwise yummy!  Waitstaff was super attentive."}
{"text":"Even though it's only about a mile from my house, this was my first visit to this location and I was happy we decided to eat there today. I had lunch with friends I haven't seen in a while so we spent quite a bit of time visiting but never felt rushed by our servers. My chimichanga, rice, refried beans and quac were delicious. The red sauce was a little salty but when combined with the rice and beans it was very good. I've recommended Viva Mercado's to some friends who have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant. I may be stopping in with them sometime soon."}
{"text":"Got there just after they opened on a Saturday and were welcomed warmly.  Service was prompt and they brought us free roasted onions and jalapenos which were yummy.  The chilaquilles were just ok I guess. They also brought us a free dessert of fried tortillas with cinnamon sugar, and both chocolate and caramel sauces which was the perfect size and ending to the meal.  We will stop again for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I had date night last night. We decided to eat here and it was amazing. I ordered the Carne asada burrito it was the best burrito I've ever had. I have driven to CA just because I couldn't find anything better here in town until now. The service  staff was also surprising. They were Best I have seen in some time."}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place. Great atmosphere. Excellent excellent service!!!  Happy hour menu. Beer was ice cold. Complimentary chips & salsa with bean dip. My bf got the camaron diablo and it was excellent, big shrimp, rice and beans. I got the fish tacos with rice and beans. Big portions. And they give you a complimentary dessert :) we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Everytime we dine here we have an excellent experience. Food is consistently delicious. Endless bowls of chips, salsa and beans. The service is absolutely some of the best in the area."}
{"text":"Wow!! Delicious and great place hands down! The food, service and ambiance :). I love walking into a Mexican restaurant and actually hearing authentic rancheras! So A+ for that! In addition the food and service was exceptional! Needless to say I will be back:)"}
{"text":"Very satisfied! Delicious Mexican food, very respectable, and ask a lot of questions to ensure you that you get what you want. Then to assume you want certain foods (definitely great for the \"picky\" eater) :)"}
