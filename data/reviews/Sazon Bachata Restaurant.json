{"text":"I recently dined at Sazon Bachata.  Visiting from out of town and in search of places to dance Bachata, I Googled \"Bachata Phoenix AZ\". To my surprise, this restaurant was listed.  The name caught my attention.  I was thoroughly pleased!  The food was DELICIOUS! The family owned staff were extremely warm and pleasant.  I felt as though I were dining with family. I ordered Pollo Guisado, but it wasn't available. The young girl who took my order suggested I try the bistec instead. I ordered the bistec with arroz blanco, habichuelas and maduros.  Then, I topped it off with a morir sonando for the road.  I was also given information on Dominican places to dance Bachata.  Looks like I'll have a lot to do on my next visit.  Oh yes, there will definitely be a next time.  Much success to Sazon Bachata!"}
{"text":"I love all types of food from all over the world! I moved to Arizona in 2009, I've traveled all over the world & I am very opened minded to different cultures.

Caribbean food is my absolute favorite, I love Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, & Jamaican food. They all have there own unique \"SAZON\" meaning Seasoning! Which they all take a very special pride in, in other words grandmas secret recipe!

The moment I stepped into SAZON BACHATA I knew I was in for a treat, I could smell the well seasoned food immediately, the atmosphere is not the richest but it sure felt like I was in my moms kitchen & who cooks better than mom? NOBODY LOL

I HAD THE POLLO GUISAO with ARROZ BLANCO/Chicken stew over white rice...AMAZING IF I MAY ADD, my sides included fresh Avocado slices! Platano Maduros that complimented the meal very nicely. 2 drink, I had the morir soñando which was very refreshing in this Arizona Heat! Try it...you will not be disappointed. 

For the earlier reviewers I enjoyed the 16 year  old young server who helped my party, Just like most Latino family's showing there young daughter what hard work is all about! 

It's small...it's perfect, I guess it's a family thing ;)"}

{"text":"Hands down my new spot for Dominican food.  Authentic is the best way to describe the food and the ambience.  By far the best Dominican food I've tasted since the Malecón in New York. Affordable & amazing! The plantains were TO DIE FOR! I felt like I was at home from the moment I walked in. Aventura playing, scooping up rice and beans...I was in Dominican heaven."}
{"text":"Food is incredible!! Pollo guisao moro & plantanos is a must have!! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I enjoy the food personally, and friends I have sent there who are from the Caribbean consistently say it is authentic. I have a work project which requires expertise in Dominican cuisine and the owners have been super helpful in answering my many questions.

Since I am likely to be the only güera in the place when I go...it is also a great way for me to improve my Dominican Spanish. It's like when you step in the door you step out of the desert and onto a tropical island. ! :)"}
{"text":"Never ate Dominican food before but this was very good! Cooked perfectly. Had pepper beef and rice and a bowl of beans. I also got a complimentary simple fresh salad and free glass of the best pink lemonade I ever drank. I will be back!"}
{"text":"So...sad..!! This place closed down.!! 

Authentic, friendly, clean and most importantly excellent food.. Folks who go to Bachata must appreciate the environment is driven with a sense of warmth and familial appreciation.. Don't expect a \"Chain food\" environment.. You can expect quality food and genuine friendly down to earth service.  My family and I will continue to eat their.. 

By the way,  YOU HAVE TO TRY their Sancocho and Carne Guizada.. Awesome place.."}
{"text":"Wow. Go now. For their food, not the luxurious surroundings. Dominican food that is, simply, delicious. Went there for lunch today - shrimp in garlic sauce. Perfection. 

Sat next to a Dominican from New York who, having found out yesterday that today's special would be mashed plantains fasted until lunch so he could eat them with the necessary gusto. So will I the next time it's on special.

How many restaurants in your life have such a dish? Add this one to it."}
{"text":"Food may be good.  But you have to pay attention to service. If you have a teenager taking orders that has her headphones on at the same time she is taking orders she is bound to make a mistake.  Service is as important as the food. Hire some one that is there to pay attention. 

Will never come back again. Print a menu so the customer doesn't have to wait 30 minutes for you to write it on the blackboard.  Don't open your doors until you are ready."}
{"text":"This Is Authentic dominican food what a good experience we had coming here , family owned and very delicious food.Every time I eat there my tummy is satisfied and I feel great.you can tell they use quality ingredient.5/5 Love this plate!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is more than wonderful. The staff treats you like you're at home. It's one of the best little joints I've been too in a long time. The menu changes daily so you can have something different every day. The prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended. Come and enjoy."}
