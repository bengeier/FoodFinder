{"text":"I didn't order ahead so I had to wait.  Now I know, I'll call in next time.  This is strictly a take out place.  There is one table for eating in.  I got the turkey sub, due to diet restrictions (no mayo, no cheese) it was bland, but that's all on me.  They have enough toppings etc to make it tasty.  I'll be back, this time I'm calling first because you can't keep a hungry man waiting.
PS - Hey Big Ross, could you put a menu online?"}
{"text":"Got a steak and cheese with some sort of special sauce. I wasn't that impressed. I will try again just not that sandwich."}
{"text":"Really really good hoagies I get the whole Italian one every time and never had a problem here would recommend to anyone one of the best hoagies I've ever had and didn't realize they had more then just hoagies they have pizza and wings and that as well going to try some more things on the menu sometime it's also nice that it isn't too far from where I live the only thing is that they only take cash no credit cards or anything like that."}
{"text":"This place has the best hoagies I ever ate in my life. The bread is always fresh in the meats are high-quality in the vegetables that are really good their cheese steak Hoagie with the works is the best I ever had."}
