{"text":"Update: 
Their quality became very unstable recently. While their xioa long bao are always good, there're times when their Hot&Sour Soup tasted like water and the meat of drunken chicken was mushy. Some other dishes failed too. We tried their lamb hot pot. The lamb was very hard, which was quite disappointing. 

It will be very nice if they can keep up with their standard all the times.


___________________________________________________

I love Shanghai food, especially Xiao Long Bao (???). Throughout the years I've tried numerous places in the GTA, but I haven't found one that I really liked until I found this place. Their Xiao long Bao's wraps are more delicate than most places, thin and smooth but still won't break easily when picked up with chopsticks, and don't get dry after leaving out for a while. The soup and filling inside tasted perfect. What I meant by perfect is they are tasty but you know there's not a lot of MSG compare to most places. We talked to the servers and they told us they are the same company as the ?? in Shanghai, and their chef is from the same place as well. 

There're other dishes that I love too. Their drunken chicken is also the best in town. Again, I've tried this in numerous places. 

Shanghai fried noodles, rice in soup (?????), fried bun (???) , fried dumplings (??) are all simple stuff, but they can make them very delicious. 

Their main dishes are also delicious. Haven't try them all yet, but very interested in doing so. 

Some people may find their dishes not flavorful enough. But this is probably due to the fact that they don't put much MSG and salt, which I would appreciate.  I don't feel thirsty after eating here. 

The place itself is clean and the seating is comfortable, not crowded at all. Even the servers may not look too friendly in the beginning, they're very attentive. 

Last but not least, their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"- Slightly on the upscale side
- Price - pricy
- Taste - overall good.. with nice ingredients
- Recommend - crab xiao long bao"}
{"text":"This is only an okay Shanghai rest. We ordered the black truffle xlb and a reg xlb. Both tasted the same, the only thing different about them was the appearance, one was black skin and other was white. Don't know what all the hype is about black truffle xlb? We also ordered a shaghai chow mein, portion was small and a order of wor tip. Bill came out to 40 bucks for these 4 dishes. Not worth the price for what you get. Would not come back as there are other Shanghai rest in markham that are better and cheaper."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic xiao long bao, you can stop your search, because this place has the best xlb in town, hands down!   And as a bonus, they also have amazing sheng jian baos.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you come here, don't look to be full but rather to try something new.  I tried most of their meat dumplings which were pretty good.  They actually had sauce in them and definitely far from those you buy from the supermarket.  The meat within them were cooked well but it came in a small portion  4 dumplings cost $4

I tried the soup filled dumpling which was $6 and I'd say it was really unique.  The soup was quite good but once you're done you're sorta just left with the dumpling wrap.  There wasn't a lot of soup either but definitely a cool dish to try.  

The staff were really nice and were at your service right away.  The decor was pretty nice too, I wouldn't say there's anything special but it was very clean and  gives off the classy vibe.  

If you're in the area it's definitely a good place to try!"}
{"text":"I visited this place in an afternoon, so it won't be crowded with so many people waiting for a seat. However, after I have been to this place myself. I really don't get why people are so attracted to this place. 

Some foods are yummy but you really have to know what to order in the first place, since some of their dishes still need improvement. The small soup filled bun was delicious and I really liked it. The other dishes were alright, you won't be surprised by them and they tasted the same in other cheaper restaurants. However, do not order their large soup filled buns, it should have been way better than what I got. The soup inside does not really have a great taste and there is very few ingredients inside of it. Judging by the food, I would give this place a score of 3.5 stars (ordered 5 dishes and 3 of them are tasty, and one was okay)

The reason I give this place a 1-star is because of its service. The food arrived on time and everything is okay. But the waiter/waitress's manner was amazingly bad. The waitress had a hard time to recommend any dishes for us. And two of our ordered dishes cannot be made because they are out of pork meats I guess (well not the waiter/waitress's fault). Aside from these, the main reason that I am really upset about this place was because of the waiter. He was cleaning the tables and not servicing us, and he farted very loudly right beside me while I am eating. I mean, why would anyone do that? He is not servicing anyone and the whole place only has two or three small groups of guests. He could have gone to the washroom or other places instead of disgust me while I am eating. I understand that there might be some circumstances that made him behave like that, but this is really rude to the customers who are currently enjoying their dinner.

In general, the decoration of the place was nice and the kitchen seems clean. But I won't recommend this place to anyone due to the behaviour of the waiter and the waitress today."}
{"text":"This place did not live up the name. Tried the soup dumping, so disappointed. The soup inside taste like water rather than soup. Tofu is blend,  scallion pancake taste like fried dough. Would not recommend and never come here again."}
{"text":"A great Shanghi food restaurant. Maybe not the best in toronto, but at least in the top three of the many I have sampled. 

Went on a sunday morning at 11:00 (when it opened). It was not empty but not way overcrowded like Ala Kitchen or Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place. The location is nice and accessible and parking is easy too. Its in the location where Akbane AYCE sushi restaurant was before. They improved the space though and its not as dark & dreary as it was during the Akbane era.  Its nice and clean too, at least in the dining area (i did not have a chance to visit the washroom facilities). 

The menu is nice and easy to read and understand and has pictures for the non chinese speaking white guys such as myself. Its a full menu but not too extensive. You find all the Shanghi dishes you are looking for. The quality of the food is superb as well, and its authenticity as genuine Shanghi food was confirmed by the wife, who is from Shanghi and speaks Shanghinese. 

I would certainly go back. My rating for itbwould be 4.5, but im rounding down, only because its relatively a bit more expensive compared to other Shanghi restaurants (which are in general a bit more expensive than the average chinese restaurant). And they accepted credit card, which was nice. 

A winner in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pretty good, worth try it out. ???,?dragon ? ??????????does not like others.. we don't think it is makr by egg white.."}
{"text":"This establishment is a very disappointment even though the service is better than average Chinese restaurants.  The Shredded Pork and Salted Mustard with Noodles in Soup (?????) is served very cold, I have to ask them to reheat the dish.  The Onion Pancake filled with Beef (????) tastes more like Cantonese BBQ Buns rolled in pancakes"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Me and my wife went there today and was totally disappointed with the way they treat people. We were told we would wait 15min so we waited. After 30min we asked again and was told there are only 2 people ahead. We waited another 10mins , asked again and were only told we need to wait another 45 mins with no apologies and some sort of ego. It would be nice to tell us the truth in the beginning so we don't waste time."}
{"text":"Not satisfied with Pan fired pork bun. The bottom is too hard and the meat tastes so-so, which make me so disappointed. Other traditional food are also not good enough as I expected except Little steamed bun. It's the best I've tried in GTA. Highly recommended. I wanna give 3stars but for little steamed bun I'd like to give them 4stars, hope they can keep the quality."}
{"text":"We went during soft opening. 
Service was good but they did not know their menu very well.  My son has peanut allergy so we have to be very careful.  The menu itself didn't give much description about each dish.  They couldn't confirm if some of the dishes had contact with peanuts... 
I personally don't like their noodle, soft no texture at all.  Soup base was okay.  
Everything is in small portion. 
Their significant dish, soup inside a bun was not great neither... soup was tasteless.  
My husband described it was like drinking water from a straw 
I don't think we will go back ... nothing special that we want to go back."}
{"text":"The first, last and only time I had soup dumplings was in 2013, and it was at Din Tai Fung in Seattle, WA.  So I can't really say that I have a strong frame of reference in which to compare soup dumplings to one another, but my recent visit to Yu Garden delivered a strong enough experience that I'll remember for a long time.

According to my friend, they have the best soup dumplings in Toronto.  So naturally I had to check 'em out!

And without a doubt, the soup dumplings did not disappoint!  We were a group of seven, and we ordered a whole ton of dishes, and the dishes that stood out were the soup dumplings:

1. Shanghai Style Pan Seared Mini Pork Bun
2. King Sized Nanxiang Crab RoeSoup Steamed Bun
3. Crab Meat & Pork Steamed Bun

The king sized bun is served with a straw in order to drink up the soup to help avoid spillage.

But apart from the dumplings, the other dishes we ordered were a significant drop-off in comparison.  Next time I would avoid cold dishes and a dish which was just julienne potatoes with green peppers.

I'm hoping that my next visit, with different dishes, will convince me to upgrade my review to 5 stars.  But as it stands Yu Garden is fantastic for soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends because we got a coupon for free dish if we spend $50.

Service:
Reservations recommended. This place is very busy during prime time. Service was okay, nothing bad or outstanding.

Food:
Ordered some classic dishes to try first. The mini soup dumplings were okay, the classic one was good but the variation with truffle was not. The truffle one had no truffle taste at all. Additionally the giant soup dumpling with the straw was not worth it, not flavourful and only soup. The classic dishes like the rice cake dish, smooth silky egg whites, fried dumpling, beef wrap were well done. Tried the fried sticky rice cake as well. It looks unique but could have been paired with park floss to give it more taste. The savoury soy milk was basically a soup with no soy milk flavour. Overall, a bit disappointing.

Decor:
The small tables are placed very close together. It was so close together that people and the waiters kept brushing behind my seat and I couldn't put my jacket there without risking it falling or getting dirty.

{"text":"This place got me on the interesting xiao long baos. Unfortunately they were not as flavourful as I had expected them to be. The concept is quite interesting however, I really wish this place could just up the flavour. It was all very bland and doughy.

Stay away from the giant soup dumpling, the soup was very watery and after you drink it, you're left with a giant piece of flavourless dough to attempt to eat."}
{"text":"Yu Garden is a famous \"dimsum\" small dish eatery in Shanghai. 
I was excited when my friend told me about this eatery opening up in toronto. 
We came for lunch and ordered the following for 2 people:
Deep fried crispy rice cake
Wheat gluten and Black mushroom
Nanxiang Drunken chicken
Chef's special poached chicken
Shanghai fried soft rice cake
We ordered 2 chickens due to me, being a Canadian shanghai Chinese read the menu in Chinese. As the poached chicken was written in a way that lead me to believe it was a deconstructed way of describing drunken chicken as it mentions the region (also used as identifying name) of the \"yellow spirit/wine\" and it being a house special at $17 for half a chicken. An aside, shanghai cuisine is not known for poached chicken ( Cantonese poached chicken is the emblem for Chinese poached Chinese), but drunken chicken will look like poached chicken. Anyways, my fault for not reading the menu. 
Texture and temperature of the poached chicken was fine. It just had no taste of chicken. I mean if I were to order any poached chicken dish it would be Singapore Hunan chicken (I certainly would never have order a poached chicken dish in a shanghai restaurant). Initially I thought it was drunken chicken and when I bit into it, it was literally like eat something that has a texture of chicken But zero taste. No flavor.  I then asked and was corrected by the server (I physically circled and orders the wrong dish) so I ordered the drunken chicken. When it arrived, It also had no chicken taste. The wine flavor was fine. Just no chicken taste. So weird. They must have used some non-organic tasteless chicken. 

The wheat gluten and black mushroom arrived and when I tasted it, it was not good. Linear in flavor, skewed towards mainly sweetness. It should be rich in texture and has a depth of flavor, oily, salty and sweet. It's like they forgot the soy. Texture is not right as well. The wheat gluten should have been air dried so that the outer part is kind of \"crusty\" and have the inner part soft also to have interplay between \"meaty\"mushrooms, crunchy bamboo shoots (which they don't have), cleansing napa cabbage, herbal string mushrooms (which they again don't have). A disappointment. 

The deep fried crispy rice cake is fine. Except it would have been great if they had just friend it a bit longer so it is golden everywhere. Better yet. Instead of deep frying the rice \"cake\" lightly then cutting it up. Just cut it up first and deep fry it much more so I can get maximum surface area that is deep fried. Even so, I have to say the flavor was bang on, fragrant and salty, almost umami. But overall it's flavor is just muted. 

The shanghai fried soft rice cake uses a vegetable called ???shepherd's purse), a very much shanghai flavor. Except the rice cake is tasteless. Had no fragrance of rice cake, texture of the rice cake is passable at best as well. Not chewy enough. They might have gotten shepherd's purse in a frozen form from the supermarkets but then they should have used lots more. Once again the flavors are fine. Just not rich nor deep. 

So weird, as shanghai cuisine is really about thick and deep and rich and oily flavors. 

Overall, its as if someone explicitly decided to mute and tone down all the taste and flavor of the dishes I tried. So instead of a rich and deep flavor that shanghai cuisine is known for, I just wisps and hints of the flavor. 

Disappointed. 

Service is lacking as well. I will just highlight one instance. The server decides to collect all of the hot oil containers from all the tables and refill them during the middle of service. This is fine as it is a Chinese restaurant. But when she had to go behind me, lean into my space and then take the oil container, not a whisper of an \"excuse me\".  I'm not Mr manners by all means. But this is just indicative of the staff not giving a rats ass about how the customer feels. I'm made to feel like I'm in their way, that they will go through the motion and tasks and that my friend and I were just there to give them money and throw the dishes in front of us. 

Expected much better."}
{"text":"Came at a time where it was not busy so I really enjoyed my time in this restaurant. 

The servers were extremely nice and attentive.Thanks for the great and friendly customer service! 

I only ordered soup dumplings because \"word of mouth,\" said that this was the best place to try soup dumplings. I'm not from Canada, originally from New York City. This experience ruined other soup dumpling experiences back in New York. What I mean is...IT TASTE SO DELICIOUS !!!! I can never eat another soup dumpling in New York City the same way again! 

However, I do want to point out something. I ordered the shark fin king size soup dumpling (with a straw) and there wasn't a lot of meat...more like barely any or any shark fin...but that's okay I'm not picky the service and the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"I came by with 2 friends on Sunday April 1st at 4pm where we were told they would reopen at 4:30pm because food ran out or something? We just went to the nearby Starbucks for 30 mins to pass the time. 

When we returned, we were seated and then ordered several soup buns, the onion pancake and some duck. The food was good but the service by the \"main server\" was pretty much non-existent. We even had to get napkins from our own purses to use. The \"main server\" who worked there seemed like she hated being there. She had no smile or manners and kept texting while she should be attentive to customers. While taking our payments, her phone that was in her pocket kept dinging with the incoming wechat (Chinese whatsapp) group messages with no intention of silencing her phone. 

I took my mom there at 9pm (Sunday April 8th) who had a flight soon so we just wanted a quick snack. The same lady was there and told us that we had 10 mins to order since they close at 10pm, which was fine because we weren't gonna stay long anyways and knew what we wanted, which was the soup buns and the marinated duck.

When we were seated, a server told told us last call was at 9:30pm so why did the \"main server\" say 10 mins?! Anyways, we ordered and before the food even arrives, the \"main server\" came over and ask us to pay first because they wanna close soon. My mom refused and said she would pay right after we get our food, which I agree with. Why am I paying before my food even arrives? Should I tip then? What if they say we already paid and we already got our food?  We were done our snacks and there were 3 tables left who came in before us. When we left, the \"main server\" didn't even look up from the front table where she was sitting or even say bye. Overall, the food is good but the service definitely needs improvement, especially that lady who I don't even know why is still employed, judging by other reviews too."}
{"text":"Most authentic shanghainese food I've had so far in Toronto. The restaurant has very modern decor and it is quite clean. The service was better than an average Chinese restaurant but nothing to rave about. The food was good and I felt the portion size was perfect for the price considering it is more of a ?? store. We ordered a lot of dishes and the total came to $22 per person including tips. 

The steamed dumplings filled with soup is amazing, the most authentic one I've had so far outside of shanghai. The fermented tofu was quite yummy too, very stinky. I would advise people to try the egg yolk stir fried shrimp as well. The only reason I took of a star is because of the fish, the duck and the large soup dumpling; these were not authentic and the flavor was very off. 

Overall I am quite happy with this restaurant. As a shanghainese living in Toronto, it is very difficult to find good authentic food from home. Definitely will revisit."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Yu Garden's steamed mini buns, especially the truffle one.  The king size one wasn't bad, but more of a gimmick, would only order it once for fun.  Prices are a bit higher than usual shanghainese restaurants with smaller portions, but food was good and restaurant was clean and new."}
{"text":"Came here to try out the large xiao long bao where you drink the soup out of a straw!! Let me start by saying, its all for show... you're better off ordering the regular sized soup dumplings. The flavour of the giant xiao long bao was not the greatest, and the dough was too thick. However, the regular sized ones were good- about average quality.

We also ordered: deep fried rice cake (which were super plain and flavourless... I do not recommend), beef wrap (which I do recommend!) and shanghai noodles (which had good flavour to it)

Overall, wouldn't mind coming back but this wouldn't be my number one choice of restaurants when I'm craving xiao long baos."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant lunch here and came on a recommendation, but not before I checked out the previous Yelp reviews. These reviews were quite mixed so we came to judge for ourselves.

The servers were ok but a little blunt for my taste. I usually put this down to a cultural difference, so ignore it mostly. Not rude or anything, just not very warm.

The food, however, was very good. A shared self selection of dim sum . Everything came out piping hot and extremely tasty. We included a wonton soup that almost was too much for a lunch for two. I liked it but my partner found it a little \"fishy\". 

I found the Onion Cake with Beef extremely good. The Vietnamese Spring Rolls too were some of the best I have had. I was hungry though, so keep that in mind.

Come and see for yourself. The decor was really very good, although the bathroom was a bit drab. They have a small private room too if you have a group of 10 or 12 that want to shut away a little from the great unwashed."}
{"text":"It was my first time to have Shanghai food in Canada. It was not totally authentic but it was good enough. The soup dumpling (xiaolong) was awesome. The scallion pancake was fine. The small pork bun (shengjian) was not right at all lol. The stinky tofu was fine but I preferred sweet sauce. We also ordered red bean yuanzi, it was not authentic but it was still delicious. Also Shansi (don't know how to say that in English lol) it was kind of expensive among all the dishes, it was fine."}
{"text":"This is far away from the authentic Shanghai food. First we tried the soybean soup, very salty. I understand it's hard to find those small green onions in Toronto, but you still can chop it to smaller pieces. Instead those green onion taste like dry grass. Then xiaolong, no salt at all??? Small wanton boiled with water instead chicken/pork soup? And ??? and ??, let me speechless

The restaurant full of Cantonese people, I guess you can finish these if you have no idea what real Shanghai foods taste. 

Please change your restaurant's name, your food has nothing to do with ??"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

Apparently they changed chefs since the first time I've been a long while back. After all the promotions and media tastings they have gone through I think they have made some improvements from the first time I have been.

Shanghai Dim Sum (SDS) has been my go to spot so I will draw comparisons against Yu Garden (YG)

Xiao Long Bao - There was quite a bit of soup, but it lacked flavour. The outer skin was a bit thicker as well. Winner: SDS

Green Onion Pancake - This was their best dish and was quite addictive. The pancake was aromatic and not too doughy. It was light and crispy on the outside. Winner: YG

Pan Fried Buns - Filling was flavourful and had lots of soup inside. Bottom was a bit too burnt unfortunately. Winner: Tied

Stir Fried Green Beans with Shrimp Paste and Minced Pork - This was quite tasty and flavourful. Recommended to eat with rice. On par with other stir fry dishes at SDS. Winner: Tied

Service was quite attentive. They would frequently come over to check on you and change your plates as well.

I would give an edge to SDS as it is crucial to have an emphasis on the quality of the XLBs. But would definitely come back again to give their other dishes a try."}
{"text":"Delicious Shanghainese food. Highly recommend the Minced Pork Steamed Bun (xiaolongbao), Pan Seared Pork Dumpling and the poached chicken."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place since it opened. I was worried that as non Asians we would be intimidated by either the staff and the food. After all this is not The Mandarin. I can tell you that this place has everything from hard core Asian cuisine to simple rice and noodles. The food is delicious and fresh and we are picky Asian food eaters. The place is packed every night so I am not the only one that enjoys this place. The ambiance is classy yet casual. We were not intimidated by the staff and they were very polite and helpful to our naive needs."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service is like omgggg. The manager kept us waiting cuz the tables r for 4+ and we only had two people while all the other people just ordered so the waiting time would be more than an hour. So we found another couple to share the table and we told the manager that we were gonna share. She kept making us wait for one more moment for 20 minutes. And then, she put a reserved sign on all the tables that are available. And when we argued that we came first and we could've share and how we would've changed to another restaurant. She said nothing and was like \"all i could say is sry\".... Sounds so bitchy"}
{"text":"This place is open quite late! My friends and I wanted some sims un. Of course it's not as great as Legit dim sum restaurants but it's good for the price and open late. Service was decently quick. 

Heads up, they serve stinky tofu so if your nose is sensitive to strong scents then watch out. 
Other than that, the dim sum was quite flavourful!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go. Traditional Chinese food.It's cozy and quiet place to hand around friends."}
{"text":"This place is straight up not good. The restaurant is nice inside and lots of parking. Service is terrible. The menu has lots of neat stuff but all of it taste awful. Most dishes were extremely salty and hard to swallow. The xiao long bao was over steamed and fell apart. The giant xiao long bao tasted awful, dont bother coming here to try it."}
{"text":"The xiao long baos are very good. I would say the best in Markham. The skin was very thin with a lot of soup. The soup inside was not very dense like other places. However the other dishes were average. Service here is okay. Would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"1st time here. The decor look nice but when walking notice that the big black titles on the floor kinda look greasy but it wasnt slippery just felt it was maybe hard to clean the type of tiles they used on the floor. Lighting was quite warmer side not the led light that blast in your eyes.

Friendly servers, we ordered the siu long bao mini 4 pc. Did not try the big one maybe next time. The flavor insude the siu long bao was nice. The soup inside the siu long bao tasted good. 
 
We also had oily noodle withdryed shrimp, green onion and soy sauce. A bit blend to my taste. When the bowl of noodle arrived i mix the noodle trying to mix some of the soy sauce inside the bowl with the noodle but found that i would need more soy sauce inside the noodle. I can taste the freshness of the noodle and green onions.

Another dish we had was the tofu in a salted soup base. Inside had the soft tofu some dry seaweed. The soup had a very tiny bit of maybe chilly oil in it. Soup was kinda blend and the tofu was avg i think.

We also got the pan fried pork buns. Typically this dish is quite oily. The bun is pan fired in a bit of oil inside the pork bun is similar to siu long bao that has the pork soup inside the wrap. i typically add some dark vinegar. Tasted pretty good. 

Last dish we had was fried pancake roll with beef and green onions by far my favorite. Love the sweetness of the sauce with the tender of the beef. Only minor adjustment i would say is make it a bit bigger felt it was a bit smaller."}
{"text":"I lived in Shanghai for 10 years, I'm a big fan of Shanghai cuisine. For the past few years I have tried so called Shanghai cuisine in the GTA, and the experience is not satisfied. But finally, I found one! The xiaolongbao here is just like the one sold in Shanghai. Few other dishes need some improvement tbh. ?? need to be smooth side up, this way it will stay juicy. ?? need to be less watery. Both flavor are on point!

There is a dude give this restaurant 3 stars and say that the dishes need more flavor, for you sir, please go find your hardcore flavor fake Shanghai cuisine somewhere else.

Definitely a five star can-be restaurant."}
{"text":"Their XL soup dumpling was to die for, and I can have another one anytime. Great quality, and the food tastes really good. I would definitely come back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love xiaolongbao (XLB) - pork soup dumplings - and there are several Shanghainese restaurants in the Richmond Hill/Markham area that make them.  Yu Garden is hidden in the end of a strip plaza sharing the parking lot with Loblaws at High Tech and Bayview.  It is towards the very end, by the stand alone Scotiabank building.

Yu Garden is pricier that the other restaurants in the area (Ding Tai Fung, A la Kitchen, Shanghai Dim Sum, Asian Legend) but I found that they had the worst XLB of the bunch.  The issue I have is with the way it's wrapped.  The skin is of average thinness, however, the way they wrap it here, the skin forms a massive \"clump\" at the top of the dumpling.  Because of the big clump on the top of the XLB, it becomes hard when steamed.  It costs $6.99 for 6.

We tried other menu items that were average as well such as Shanghai Fried Noodles (good), Stir Fried Pea Sprouts (old sprouts, hard), Onion Pancake filled with Beef (ok), Crystal Shrimp (plain), but there was a standout dish: The dungenous crab with rice cakes saved the day!  This is the first time I've strayed from the traditional Shanghainese rice cakes stir fried with pork and vegetables (primarly cabbage).  This spin was done very well, full of flavour and a different sauce.  It was pricy (market price about $50) but very tasty.

Bottom line, don't come here for the XLB, there are many better options in the area.  This place is a 2.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Actual rating is 1.5/5. Came here for dinner on a week night. Saw on BlogTo and/or Narcity that they have this huge steamed bun that comes with a straw to drink out of, so we wanted to try it out. 

Food - 1.75/5
We wanted to order the sweet and sour spare ribs but were told they were sold out so we settled for the braised marinated duck. We also ordered the shanghai noodles with peanut sauce and added pickled cabbage and pork, shark fin soup in steamed bun and truffle with assorted mushroom and pork steamed bun. Disappointing is the only word to describe the food. I believe the duck was made properly, but I just didnt enjoy the taste. Noodles were very bland with not a lot of peanut flavour. The truffle bun looked aesthetically pleasing, but tastewise was just okay. The king size shark fin soup bun was incredibly disappointing. The dough was very thick, and soup did not have much flavour. Not a single satisfying dish. 

Service - 3/5
There was only one other table eating, so service is difficult to rate. Typical chinese service, not much to write about.

Value - 1/5
Found the price quite expensive for the quality, taste and portion size of the food. There are two prices for every single item. One is the price for members. You get a 12% discounted price on all dishes if you join. I found the member prices to be a little on the expensive side, so the non-member prices were just ridiculous to me. One of the most dissatisfying meals I've had in a while. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"The King Size Nanxiang Crab Roe Soup in Steamed Bun arrived next.  I was so excited for this!  It was definitely worthy of a photo (no matter if you are a foodie or not ).  The extra large steamed bun sat in a dumpling basket on top of a cup (to catch the residual soup).  There was a straw that stuck out from the top and there was already crab roe soup gushing out from it -- to be honest, I don't think there should have been that much soup gushing out yet -- the customer should have been the one to let that happen.

In any case, the soup was really hot to suck out from the straw so I had to let it cool for a couple of minutes first.  Once it cooled off, I really enjoyed the fresh Nanxiang crab roe soup!  After you suck out all of the soup, only the dumpling skin and its contents are left.  I only found a shrimp and some scraps of meat inside but otherwise I think the main attraction of this steamed bun was just the straw and soup part.  Nevertheless, I still really enjoyed the experience and was glad to experience it for myself!"}
{"text":"My experience was a lot less like the one from BlogTO and a lot more like other folks on here. I went for the giant soup dumplings; which were a lot more doughy than expected. The colorful dumplings were good. The black mushroom one was by far my favourite."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today and it was a total waste of time.  I would never come back again.  The stars are for the decor and the regular xiao lung bao's.  

The restaurant was pretty hard for us to find because if you're on Bayview, the signage is facing the other way. Or if there is signage, we didn't see it.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and it wasn't very busy.  We ordered the regular xiao lung bao, one king sized crab roe dumpling, hot & sour soup, glutinous rice sui mai and spicy sauce noodles.  The  regular xiao lung bao are really good, thin skinned and clear soup.  Apart from them everything else was pretty bad.  The hot & sour soup was gloopy and tasted like bad chinese takeaway soup.  It was way overpriced for $10.99, not even worth $5.99, for the taste and amount.  The XL dumpling was not really good but tasted ok, worth trying once but not that's about it.  Then we had a fiasco with the noodles.  Their ordering menu is double sided, we ordered a noodle on the other side and they hadn't seen it.  When we asked them about it, they said they were making it, which was a complete lie, they hadn't seen it.  We were in a rush to leave and needed to go but they
 insisted on charging us for it and it came as we were paying the bill.  We had no idea it was a soup noodle, so we couldn't get it to go.  So we each took a few bites, it was so bland.  The noodles themselves were ok, but the soup and little topping, didn't taste very good and so we just  left the whole bowl there. 

The lady servers were too busy talking to each other or ignoring customers.  I would not come here ever again or recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Nice buns!

Came here for dim sum dinner. Their dim sums and buns are delicious and authentic. The portions might look small, but they are quite filling so don't get carried away with your order. Place is spacious, modern, and clean. Service is excellent.

\"Members\" get 10? discount on their final bill."}
{"text":"First visit and was disappointed. Pan fried dumplings were too oily, vegetarian ???was too salty, ???? was too hard and too much sauce. Service was so so,not too attentive. Not sure if other dishes are better but unfortunately will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This review is for a two-item takeout order. The deep fried cashew nut pastry was excellent. It was warm, nutty and crispy. Enjoyed it. But the minced meat balls were absolutely disappointing. It was extremely salty. The meat balls were salted without the sauce. I think the chef put way too much salt in the sauce then even the bok choy was almost not edible due to the salt. This is a traditional dish in Shanghai cuisine. I still don't understand how yu garden self-declaring as a famous Shanghai restaurant failed it so badly. Hence they deserve one star for this experience. Additionally this dish is $15.99. The same dish at Shanghai Dim Sum restaurant on hwy7 is only $9.99 and is way better.

The service is okay. The atmosphere is on the quiet side.  The restaurant looks clean."}
{"text":"A friend recently posed a pic of a Shanghai style soup steamed bun, the kind you have to drink the soup through a straw first before you can eat. I was super excited as I haven't seen one in TO and haven't had one since being Shanghai. 
I used to be in Shanghai for a short period of time and so I came to try this place out. 
While it wasn't bad, I was gravely disappointed. Perhaps I had too high expectations? Perhaps I've had the real thing? Well authenticity was out the door but I applaud their efforts to mirror the flavours and textures. However, for the price and type of food there are other more authentic options. 
Here's what we ordered 
One of each king sized buns (crab roe - 7.99, shark fin 8.99) 
The crab roe isn't roe but minced crab meat, good on them though for the minimum fake shark fin. 
The Shanghai version has a meat ball with the crab in it. Their version, when opened only contained tiny bits of meat with some frozen shrimp and scallops. 
Classic Shanghai mini wontons (7.99/bowl) it was mainly wonton skins. I couldn't tell what the filling was. 
Cold dish minced wild veggies with bean curd (7.99) the veggies were a little \"old\". Making the texture and dish overall very dry. The Shanghai version uses fresh veggies so the dish is very crunchy. 
Deep fried onion pancake (4.99) excellent! The pastry to onion ratio was just right and not too oily. 
Spicy bean sauce and minced pork noodles (7.99/bowl) the noodles were an excellent texture. Not over or under cooked. The sauce I felt was missing the bean and minced pork, most of all the \"spicy\". It was mainly cubes of old style bean curd, potatoes and the occasional cube of pork. The spice factor was a 1.5 on a scale of 1-10. You could see the red oil but there was little to no heat. 
The prices were a bit high for what you get, but considering the location, I guess it's acceptable. 
My 2 stars? The pancake, the welcoming and excellent service and overall cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"Ate here last night because of their slogan \"the original dim sum restaurant\". I heard that their XiaoLongBaos are supposed to be even better than the Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place (the crown of XLBs in the GTA) so we had to try it out. It was delicious! Recommend the original pork and the crab roe and pork mixed. The wrappers are slightly thicker than the ones at Ding Tai Fung and so your precious soup is less likely to spill out accidentally with chopsticks. Great!

Ordered some other dishes and all were pretty good, except the sticky fried rice cakes - this was too bland, even if its fried.

The sour and spicy bakchoy was just sour, not spicy at all, so maybe also skip this.

I love the deep fried egg white souffles filled with either red bean or black sesame at other XLB restaurants (such as Ding Tai Fung or A La Shanghai), but it was odd that we HAD to order another more expensive dessert in order to add one the souffles. They were already $3 each when other restaurants offer it at $7ish for 4... So ended up not trying this but will next time.

I havent tried Yu Garden prior to yesterday because anytime we drive by, there is always a line out the door. Would recommend if you like XLBs!"}
{"text":"Ordered a steamed bun with \"Truffle\", Assorted Mushroom and pork. Could hardly taste any of the mushroom.  Had another steam bun, King Size Nanxiang Crab RoeSoup in steamed Bun. This was just a single large steamed bun. The soup inside was overly salty. And for to the large size of it, the skin for the steamed bun was thick which took away from the taste of the stuffing. Lastly we had fried rice. It came with mixed veggies and shrimp. The size of the shrimps were decent. But the rice was again far too salty. Couldn't finish the dish as the salt was just too overwhelming. 

In the end for a dinner for two spent $36. Would not come back again."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings here are pretty good. Everything else is kinda meh. 

The goods:
All the soup dumplings (not the big ones) 
Pan fried pork dumplings (my favourite) 

The meh:
The big soup dumpling (lacking in flavour) 
The green onion pan cake (lacking in green onions)"}
{"text":"(Food:) 
The MULTI-COLOURED XIAO LONG BAO was fun to look at as well as try!  This dish came with 6 different types of Xiao Long Bao and each was unique in its own way.  There was a red spicy one (quite different from normal baos), a yellow one (tasted just like normal), a green veggie one (not the best, lacking in soup inside), two normal tasting ones.  But, the best one was the black truffle and mushroom one!  It had slight hints of truffle which actually go quite well with the xiao long bao! Next time I would only get this one (or maybe the spicy one).  

The GIANT XIAO LONG BAO was not worth it.  At almost $8, it was not as big as the BlogTO post, and was not very flavourful either.  The skin is very thick and doughy.  The concept is good, but xiao long bao should be 'xiao'.

GREEN ONION PANCAKE was delicious and inexpensive.

STIR-FRIED EGG WHITE WITH SCALLOP AND CONPOY was our vegetable portion of the meal.  Was not worth it, as it is expensive and not very flavourful.  Could use way more seasoning.

(Price:) 
The MULTI-COLOURED XIAO LONG BAO: Around $7.50

The GIANT XIAO LONG BAO: $7.99

DEEP FRIED ONION PANCAKE: $4.09

STIR-FRIED EGG WHITE WITH SCALLOP AND CONPOY: $15.99

(Service:)  Pretty bad, considering how few people there were.  The servers looked frazzled and we really had to signal to them each time we wanted something else.  Even trying to pay, they did not notice us standing by the counter until minutes later. 

(Comparable:)  The price is pretty on par with places like Asian Legend, and maybe a bit more expensive than most dim sum places.  It is definitely worth trying, as their dishes have a twist on the traditional.  Definitely the Truffle Xiao Long Bao is worth going to try at least."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews i was anticipating this restaurant to be packed on a friday night so i called in to make reso which was quick and easy. 

To my surprise it was just 1/2 full which is good cuz that means service was more attentive.
Service was good but their english isn't very good so you won't really get a good description of the items if needed. But you should just check the recommended items to order from other yelpers :P

The menu was HUGE. I thought it was only one sided and fully missed the back side. Lots of varieties, meaty, bao-y and lots of veggie options. For two people we ordered: 2 XLB (xiao long bao), 2 king XLB, 1 fried bao, sliced tofu skin with beans and chilies, and drunken chicken

The XLB were good, but the fun part is seeing who has the best chop stick skills to see who can pick it up without popping it! The king XLB are single orders so you'll have to order one for each person. The skin isn't thin, it's actually thick so it's pretty filling. Although it says sharkfin soup, there's not much sharkfin and the ingredients aren't amazing either. See pictures for what's inside! The drunken chicken was my favourite dish! it was so flavorful and also because i don't get to eat that often! 

I'll recommend this to other Yelpers :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant one bit. My group and I booked a reservation for 1:15pm on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived at 1:00pm and asked the hostess for our table to find that she had given it away. Why??? We decided to wait anyway to try the food. 40 minutes later, we get a large table with a stinky lazy susan. The hostess came by with the plates, bowls, and cutlery and asked us to grab the sets for ourselves. 

For a group of five people, we ordered about $120 (before tax) worth of food including: truffle xlb, pork xlb, shrimp/pork xlb, crab meat/pork xlb, king size shark fin xlb, king size crab roe xlb, pan seared mini pork bun, onion pancake with beef, deep fried crispy rice cake, chilled bamboo shoots, drunken chicken, braised marinated duck, shredded jellyfish, and deep fried steamed bun.

All of the regular xlb was great in that it was filled with a LOT of soup and the skin was thin but other than that, the filling was rather bland. 

The two giant xlb was disappointing and definitely not worth it's price; filled with piping hot soup and an underwhelming amount of other fillings. The inside of the crab roe giant xlb contained four pieces of small shrimp and a TEENY TINY pinch of crab meat and ground pork. No crab roe to be seen. 

The pan seared mini pork bun was filled with lots of soup! I was surprised how it didn't soak into the bun. The bun itself wasn't quite pan fried enough and seemed stale.

The onion pancake with beef was flavourful but the pancake was rock hard. 

The deep fried crispy rice cake is literally white rice bricked together into a large rectangle, crisped on all it's edges then stacked fancily together. Bland, boring, expensive, not worth it.

The bamboo shoots and drunken chicken were great! GET THESE. 

Braised marinated duck lacked flavour.

The shredded jellyfish was under-seasoned, rubbery, dry, and was a chore to eat. Again, not worth it's price.

To conclude: not coming back. For a lower price, better quality, better flavour, better service, I could go to other shanghai dim sum restaurants."}
{"text":"I do recommend the lunch special combo at $7.99 for Monday to Friday only. Personally I wouldn't pay the original price for this combo at $15.98. The menu says the promotion lasts until October 31, 2017 or subject to change without notice. 

Other than the soup being so-so, everything else tasted great including the side dishes and the chicken."}
{"text":"Aside from Matsuda, I have not seen a dirtier restaurant. At least their server was nice.

Cutlery and plates were sticky. We asked for another set. The new one came back sticky as well. One of the cups we got switched to had LIPSTICK still on the edge!

Does this place not wash?

I gave two stars because their xiaolongbao was p decent. Crab meat was decent and tasted better than what I had in Hong Kong. The truffle one... The appearance was there but taste was not.

I figured I should try their shanghai noodles because this place boasts of being the best restaurant in shanghai.

It was really oily.

Would I recommend? No. Would I come back? No.

Would I come back if a friend wanted to try here? No.

At least the service was alright but I think they were tired of us complaining about the dirty dishes.

It's staggering how such a trivial detail could drag a place down."}
{"text":"We met with friends there for a late lunch on Sunday. The place was packed! Some popular dishes were gone! The steamed xiaolongbao and pan seared buns are the best I've ever tasted here in Toronto?the rest we ordered are average / below average, oily, bland, wrong cook method, over-used msg. However, we'll go back again for the buns and try something else on the menu during the weekdays."}
{"text":"Was craving shanghainese food and decided to try this place out on a Saturday evening. We ordered the xiao long bao, pan fried dumpling, hot and sour soup, shanghai noodles, and drunken chicken. All were delicious! My favourite was the xiao long bao, deep fried dumplings, and hot and sour soup. Everything was flavourful and yummy. I've read on reviews that service was horrible but the service that we received was great. The servers were attentive and removed empty dishes and even came to change our dishes once. 

Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love truffle. The truffle soup dumpling is great. You can really taste the flavor. The wait was a bit long. Another great item on the menu was the king size shark fin soup dumpling. It comes with a straw however, it is extremely HOT, wait for a bit before drinking the soup."}
{"text":"first of all, when i first came in there was a huge line up.. it took about 20-40 mins for us to be seated which is pretty atrocious. when we finally got seated we ordered right away (pan seared dumplings, fried rice sticks. peanut sauce noodles, soup dumplings, the giant dumpling with supposedly shark fin and meat inside, wontons and this jelly dessert) at first the orders came relatively fast and OMG THE PAN SEARED DUMPLINGS WERE SOOOOO GOOD, the rest were meh. we tried to add two more orders of those dumplings and it took about 30 mins for them to arrive AND when they FINALLY ARRIVED THEY DID NOT taste as good as the first batch which made me want to cry   

like others said.... their food are WAY overpriced for what you get. especially that jelly dessert i got. i am quite aware that the pictures on the menu can be quite deceiving but it was nothing compared to what i -- no what my family had witnessed. literally we were expecting like a standard radish cake amount of the jelly BUT NO THEY LITRRALLY JUST TOOK ONE 5 BY 5 CM JRLLY DESSEY AND SPLIT IT INTO FOUR AND THAT WAS FOUR FOLLARS DOWN GNE DRAIN. it was seriously like a 2.5 by 2.5 piece of jelly that costed $1 like my dad is still complaining about it and it's been like three weeks ... 

oh and their servers
are literal crap like rude and just rude 

this restaurant would have gotten a one star but that pan seared dumpling (first batch) saved its crusty ass

oh and don't expect to be full cause you're not going to be full ... if you decide to be brave and wanna try their food go ahead but im warning yall, you ain't gonna be full 

you're gonna have to end up going to heros or subway next door"}
{"text":"Went for the giant Soup Dumpling. It was \"ok\". A bit bland, but the truffle one was good!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Shanghai restaurant in Markham. They have a huge variety of dishes. Tried the truffle XLB and their jumbo shark fin dumpling which was very unique and not disappointing at all."}
{"text":"Classic soup dumplings and pea sprouts are very good. The king size soup dumpling was good but I would just stick with the regular ones. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"The lunch combo special for $7.99 is pretty good. The Shanghai noodles was tasty and not too oily. The seafood pancake wasn't doughy and very crispy."}
{"text":"Very good shaihainess food. Not too salty but very flavorful. I love the eel dish if you are adventurous enough to try. Steambun is the best in town. Cannot miss."}
{"text":"The first time I had their Xiao along Bao was at the T&T Night Market. I was craving Chinese food lately so decided to drive uptown to Yu Garden!

My Shanghainese friend says their dishes are very authentic and I really love their Xiao Long Bao! Highly recommend this restaurant, you'll know it's a good one since it's almost always packed. I also really like their Green Onion Pancake, super crispy!!!

The rice cake was too oily and too little meat/veggies. That was what disappointed me because it's one of my favourite shanghainese dishes!"}
{"text":"Left Shanghai my hometown 3 years already, this is the best place with Shanghai taste I ever visited. Look the menu, all those familiar names. I would recommend to all my friends from shanghai."}
{"text":"Decent if you've never been to Shanghai.  Food tastes alright but not authentic."}
{"text":"I went to this Chinese restaurant today with a friend for dinner. We both really liked it. The food especially Shanghai soup dumplings are really good. Not that oily and I don't taste strong MSG taste. Much better than Asian Ledgend and other places I have been.. The service was good and the Chinese waiters speak pretty good english :). The mini wonton soup was and the cashew fried balls just ok. The soup dumping was the best here and stir fry veggies was good too."}
{"text":"I went there twice, so I highly recommended this restaurant. The food are SO GREAT. As a huge foodie, I do recommend the feature dishes like steamed buns ?????and stewed pork with brown sauce (????. I even want to rate six stars! Typical Chinese delicious restaurant. Never miss this one!"}
{"text":"Pretty overpriced for a dumpling place. Everything was mediocre. We ordered the large soup filled dumpling but it was really just a novelty item and extremely hard to sip hot soup out of a straw even after letting it sit. We ended up breaking it apart and it was just a mess. A regular fried rice was $15, I felt this be by hefty for nothing special. My stars all go to the regular soup filled pork dumplings -these were great, and skin was perfectly thin; something I'd pay a premium for. Otherwise there are way better Shanghai places in the Richmond Hill area."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch. I've always wanted to come here after seeing posts about this restaurant on social media. The xiao long baos were really good! My friend and I really enjoyed it. The food came out pretty quickly. The soup bao was a little disappointing, as it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Overall, my friend and I had a really good experience here . Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went to try this newly opened Shanghai restaurant today for the first time.  We ordered 9 dishes and I rate each dish by star.  Five star being the highest and one star the lowest.  

1. Hot and sour soup.  3 star, average.

2. Truffle mushroom & pork steam bun.  4 star, quite unique with light purple colour. See photo.  

3.  Pan seared mini pork bun.  5 star, the only restaurant in this area that I went to that put sesame seeds and chives on the top of the bun(It is suppose to be). Good.  

4.  Crispy fried spring roll.  3 star, so so.

5.  Deep fried onion pancake.  4 star, quite good.

6.  Wheat gluten & black mushroom.  5 star, highly recommend.

7.  Chilled smoked fish in spices.  4 1/2 star, almost perfect.

8.  Shanghai fried noodle.  3 star, couldn't find any pork, disappoint dish.

9.  Shanghai fried soft rice cake.  4 star,  quite.

Mind you the portion is small. Not good if you are a big eater.  Also it doesn't serve glutinous rice roll with pork floss.  Instead it serve rice cake, I haven't tried it.

The service was good, a rarity in Chinese restaurant.  And yes, it accept credit cards too, a rarity as well.  Because it is a new restaurant, everything is new and clean.  I consider this restaurant as upscale, it reflects on the price of the dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was full. I would suggest making reservations. The food was good, but for the portions and inconsistent service, it is not worth the price. You have to pay a membership fee to get better pricing. For example a small hot and sour soup that serves 2 to 4 people was $10.99."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant on a Friday at around 1:45pm.  There was approximately 7 tables occupied, and overall business was light.  When me and my colleague arrived we were greeted by a waitress/hostess \"wearing mini shorts\", so I guess we must be  at the Asian version of Moxies?  While we were directed to our table, we were each given a menu and with a smile from Mini Shorts she simply brisked away...  A gentleman (probably the manager) walked by and greeted us with a smile and a nodding gesture assuming to give us a sense of gratitude for whatever we will endure in the next hour....  
To me the dishes were mediocre and we had to remind them of a forgotten dish.  My colleague said it'll be the last time he'll listen to me for lunch suggestions, and that's because he initially wanted to go for Dim Sum at a nearby restaurant (which isn't too good either).  He even told me to give no tips, but I told him instead of tipping 15% I will simply tip 5%.

At the time, this didn't really bother me, but when my colleague  mentioned it to me I agreed.  The waiter (a young chap), supposedly serving his patrons decided to clean and refill the vinegar/sauce bottles.  While we were having our Xioa Long Baos... he would do his re-fills at our table.  My colleague was in complete disarray, and I told him  it's a normal routine at a Chinese restaurant, and the young chap was doing his daily run.  Low and behold he would come back a 2nd time!!  This time replacing an already filled bottle of vineger with another.... I jokingly said \"he might do it again the third time.\"

Anyways after an ordeal with burnt food, soup squirting on dress shirts (lol), and a forgotten dish, we decided to ask for the bill.  The young waiter standing around cleaning vinegar bottles happen to glance over, so I gestured for the bill.  The young chap called out  a waitress and told her that we needed the bill.  She came over with the bill and I inserted my cc into their machine but entered 0% for tips... so I cancelled the transaction and handed the machine back to the waitress.  The waitress was not very attentive (not Mini Shorts by the way, she disappeared), so I had to waive at her to let her know I made a mistake.  With a care free attitude  she simply punched in the sale again and handed the machine back to me and I punched 10%, darn it!!!  At that moment, I just wanted to get out, so I confirmed the transaction and done!  Out of there!!!  First time and last time at the Yu Gardens!

By the way during my ordeal with the machine the young chap replaced the vinegar bottles at our table for the  3rd time.....  My buddy says, the young chap is just a \"slacker\"....  lol."}
{"text":"Out of all the items we ordered, the ones that stood out the most were the steamed buns with soup (xiao long bao), onion pancake filled with beef and cured pork & vegetable fried rice. The rest were average dishes except one dish. Do not order the king sized steamed bun with a straw! There were no flavours in the soup... It tasted like the water the wontons were cooked in and the skin of the bun was soggy. A selling gimmick so save your money! Overall, this place wasn't that impressive but if you crave the steamed buns with soup I would come and order that dish only."}
{"text":"I've been to this local Shanghai style restaurant three times now. The first time I had an amazing experience (this was couple years back) because I was thrilled to have good Asian restaurant in the Thornhill area. The second time it was alright and the third time (recently) it was just good. Don't get me wrong, I'm still glad to have local good eats but honestly, I'm not that far away from Commerce Gate / Yonge and Finch / Markham and there's tons of steep competition there so I give this place an average. The xiao long baos are decent here. The skin isn't too thick or thin and the inside is juicy but the meat tends to be overcooked and a bit dry. The shanghai noodles are alright but I find them to be a little tasteless. It could use more seasoning and maybe some more flavour with other ingredients. The large soup filled buns are interesting. It literally comes in a straw and you can drink it. Mmm shark fin soup anyone? Though I didn't see any shark fins...  They got the standard onion pancakes, fried sweet and sour fish, cold appetizers, fried dumplings, raised pork belly, etc etc. 

The decor inside is modern and clean. It's also spacious enough to gather small groups of family and friends and it's usually not too busy so no lineups out the door kind of thing. Overall, good neighbourhood restaurant. 

PS do not believe in their website. There is NO DELIVERY!"}
{"text":"I used older yelp reviews to help with my order.  The food is delicious.  The restaurant packed with what looked to me like regulars.  The serving staff helpful and generous.  The service fast.  The prices - ok I thought.  

The dim sums are specific to the location.  I'm slowly learning how everyone does everything a bit different.  What is most important to me is how good the food was.

Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great service..I enjoyed the few specialties such as the gigantic soup filled dumpling. It was pretty good but I still prefer Ala Kitchen. Their glutinous rice dim sum was also tasty."}
{"text":"They have beer!!!!  Clean place.  Decent  decor.  Good service.  They have a few gimmick dishes.  The  soup filled bun with a straw - - CAUTION!  HOT LIQUID--looks great,  does have  soup in it,  but the  soup is nothing extraordinary,  and  the dough is a lil thick.  The braised pork belly (dung boh pork)  is good,  no taste of fattiness, and the  sauce is also good as a dip.   The crabmeat style egg white is  small with no egg yolk on top--disappointed.  The deep fried sticky rice was not  oily but a tad dry.  We used  it to dip the sauce of the  braised pork belly.  The  taro scallion dish  is a throwtogether of cut up taro and spring onion. Nothing  special. Score works have  been  3.5 but they have beer,  so  I am  giving  a 4."}
{"text":"Wanting to try the king sized xiao long pao but was disappointed when it all just contain soup with a few pieces of crab roe. The meat xiao long pao however is good, ordinary. Hot and sour soup didn't meet my expectations as I need to add more black vinegar to it. The beef bun is ok and so is the snow pea vegetable with crab meat. Pork noodle soup taste good. 

Price is a little higher compare to other shanghai dimsum restaurant. Place is nicely done. Staff are nice."}
{"text":"I love Shanghainese food. This place disappoint me. 4 out of 5 dishes including fish soup, fried beef and cold drunk chicken are very very salty. Only fried rice is good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the experience. The decor was inviting, modern and clean. The service was fast and attentive. We were there a bit early for lunch and it was not too busy on a weekday. 

We ordered several dim sum dishes that were all excellent and served hot. Instead of carts coming around  you fill out an order form with  the item number and they pick it up from your table.  The two of us shared a number of dishes and were not left hungry. My only issue was that the wonton soup was a bit too fishy tasting. 

Others have commented that the price was high but I felt the price was appropriate for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"tldr: Shanghai food quality is mixed; some of their items are excellent while others are lackluster. The shanghai pan-seared mini pork buns (sheng jian bao) and the deep fried cashew nut pastry were the best I've ever had in Markham! Prices are quite expensive; we spent $90 for a party of 3.

Be prepared to wait a LONG TIME. We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm and the queue was over an hour for a party of 3. You get to put your name and number down on an iPad and they will text you when a table is ready. The app is super buggy though and we were called in 30min ahead of time so they seated us earlier for the trouble. That was nice of them. 

MUST TRY:

Shanghai pan-searched mini pork buns (x4): Pork buns that were pan-seared to a crispy on the bottom. The generous ball meat inside was packed with hot soup and was very tasty and rich. Take a small bite and sip the soup out as it can burn your tongue. A splash of vinegar will make it taste even better.

Deep fried cashew nut pastry (x4): AMAZING! I ordered two more to go. They're warm and very flaky when you order in. The inside is a chunky cashew paste that's a bit savory and sweet, kind of hard to describe the flavor other than it being delicious. 

MEH (sadly there were too many items that we tried that were mediocre):

Shanghai mini pork buns (x6): Very thin skin soup dumplings that had a good amount of soup inside. The pork was well cooked but lacked a meaty rich flavor. The skin held together even after dipping into the vinegar sauce despite it being paper thin.

Wheat gluten and black mushroom (hand-sized plate): Slightly sweet and salty in flavor; mild in taste. The gluten held a good spongey texture and the mushroom and bamboo were a good combination. Just not spectacular. 

Chilled smoked fish in spices (hand-sized plate): Flavor was decent though it was just soy saucey and not smoked. The fish was also broken into much smaller pieces than whole, sizeable fish pieces as per the norm.

Classic Shanghai mini wontons (10 wontons): The wontons are very small, the meat is the size of a pinky nail. The soup is clear and light in flavor and it's a good mild dish all-around. Just don't expect a strong flavor and you'll be pleased.

Deep Fried Crispy Rice Cake (x6): Very crispy on the outside with lightly salted rice on the inside. I enjoyed it but the slightly salty rice was underwhelming. It does have a very satisfying crunch and I would've eaten more if it hadn't been so oily.

Soft Bean Curd with Sesame Oil & Scallion: A small bowl of soft savory bean curd that wasn't as soupy as it normally is. The bean curd was very whole and didn't soak in much of the flavor of the soup which was disappointing. Eat this if you just want some soft tofu.

MORTIFYING: 

Sweet and sour spareribs: No meat. No flavor. Nada. This dish is mostly bone and just a bit of soy sauce? There was barely any meat, mostly bone and cartillage and it didn't have any of sweet and sour taste at all. What a disappointment.

Sweet soy milk: Tasted mostly like water. At least it was too sweet but it had no soybean flavor whatsoever."}
{"text":"Even though nothing compares to authentic Shanghai food back home, I believe this is the best Shanghai restaurant we have tried in GTA over the years. We ordered Shanghai pan seared mini pork buns (?????which are so far the best I have had in Canada. Crab meat and pork steamed buns are nice too. Classic mini wonton is ok, a little bland. Minced meat ball (????is decent, remind me of dinning hall food, and it goes well with plain rice. Pork vegetable field rice and spring rolls were not that great. The price is higher than other Chinese restaurant. Our meal cost $100 cash for three of us and we didn't order anything fancy."}
{"text":"I would never go back to this place ever again!! I wish I can give 0 stars. 

I came across this place and thought to try it out! My bad!! The sevice was horrible and ... i can't speak to the food, didn't have any because they never brought it us. The highlight of our visit... ummmmmm the tea they brought to us 30 mins after we sat down??? It was warmish?? 

We waited over an hour for a table, and it was another 30 mins before we saw the server.  Subsequently it was an hour long wait for the 'food'.

The final straw was when, over 2 hours into already a bad experience, the server says to us, a table of 5: ' we ran out this and this.... it will be another 30 -40 mins before you get this...'. 
 
No apologies from the server or the owner. This is no way to treat your customers!!"}
{"text":"clean  and friendly staff
dumplings were cool...most of them have soup inside of dumpling."}
{"text":"Delish xiao long bao! Do the sampler dish to get a feel of the different flavours available. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"The food is above average, even though the potion is small. I like it when it first opened its door. However, the restaurant has currently recruited few of the worst waitresses I have seen in the last 30 years of my life. Onetime, one of the waitress insist a spider (yes, a dead spider) in my soup is actually some kinda spice flower... and no apology was offered at all. The second time, the waitresses are in such hurry to leave at 10pm and started to rushing us to pay the bills ( which is okay, a common practice of many Chinese restaurants), asking us to pack the food, even taking away our unfinished food. I told her I am not done eating yet, it's just 10pm. If they expect to leave at 10pm sharp, they shouldn't let people in at 9:30pm. Also, their service can only be described as hostile on both occasions... it's shame to see a once nice restaurant become like this. I certainly won't return and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The cold White wine chicken was extremely salty! Ruined the taste. Service was terrible for Friday night 8pm. Had to ask for tea and the main lady server/hostess was extremely rude.

The condense milk bread was terrible, tasted like they just heates up frozen bread. 2 of the breads supposed to be fries but was jus oil ovee bread.

The minced pork XLB was good, only safe choice to order."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - their xiao long bao is good, as are their typical shanghai dim sum offerings, but the price is definitely steep. We ordered 2 platters of xlb, the beef rolls with spring onion, green beans, pan fried buns, Shanghai noodles, and vegetable buns.

Of all these items, I would suggest avoiding the Shanghai noodles and steamed vegetable buns. The Shanghai noodles were a bit bland and unimpressive - definitely below average for the price. The vegetable dumplings tasted like any other vegetable dumpling you'd get at a dim sum place. The green beans were okay, but other restaurants, in my opinion, do them better for the price point.

The xiao long bao and pan fried bun were bursting with soup - be very careful when biting into them! The pan fried buns were done really well and I didn't even mind when some of the soupy goodness got on my shirt. We also really loved the magic beef rolls - this is a must order!

Service was prompt and fast with many of the food items rushing out of the kitchen as soon as the order was placed. 

I would come here again when I'm craving xiao long bao, but probably not as often as I'd visit ding tai fung. They are around the same price point, but in my opinion, DTF has better kitchen food. You wouldn't be missing out on much if you are going out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"Get the black truffle xiao long bao. Super aromatic and strong truffle flavor. I would definitely skip the Large xiao long bao - it's not very good and just good for the insta. Regular pork xiao long bao is good as well. It's a bit pricey but the food here is so good and well worth it."}
{"text":"I am a little confused.

Yu Garden ?? is specialized in Shanghainese cuisine. Think soup filled dumplings which it is famous for.

I had been to one of the originall franchise in Singapore http://www.yelp.ca/biz/nanxiang-steamed-bun-singapore so I had tried their famous King Size Crab Roe Dumpling bun.

Is Yu Garden the same franchise as Nan Xiang Steamed Bun which originated from Shanghai? I will need further investigation. But I will just rate my experience based on food.

Pork and Crab Meat Dumplings  ($4) was tasty. I love the fried dried shredded scallop on top. Nice flavour. The wrapping though a little thick (good in a way that the soup would not leak out from the dumplings)

Spicy Meat Sauce Noodle ($6) was meh. Dice stewed pork, dried bean curd, potato with noodle in soup. I did not finish my noodle... 

Decor is classy and nice.

Servers speaks a mix of Cantonese, Mandarin and English. Menu beautiful prepared with photos. Ordering would not be an issue.

I would be back and try out other items on the menu especially the Crab Roe Steamed Bun that one would need a big straw to drink the soup."}
{"text":"The menu items looked interesting, but I was a bit disappointed when I had dim sum there. Yes, like others have mentioned, the service has a lot to be desired. We waited a little while for a table even though there were plenty of empty tables toward the back. After you're seated you really need to get their attention if you need anything, as they don't really pay attention to the diners.

There are two prices on the menu. The price prominently displayed on the menu is their \"club\" price which you need to purchase a membership and in the fine print is the regular price for everyone else. Even the Club price seems a bit steep as I find their dim sum dishes tasted pretty average.

The more unique dumplings and Xiao Long Bao were just gimmicky and not worth the premium. The black dumplings with black truffle came steaming with the strong scent of truffles, but it was merely artificial truffle oil which you can't really taste which is unfortunate as I love truffles.

The multi-coloured XLB was also pretty bland and even though each coloured dumpling had a different flavour filling, it was hard to distinguish one taste from another, which was no big loss as it was not an ideal dim sum dish as you can't really share the taste of each flavour with your table unless you order multiples of this pricey $8 steamer of just seven spoon-sized dumplings.

The siu mai-style sticky rice dish was also pretty gimmicky as it may look unique, it's just plain bland sticky rice partially encased in a dumpling wrapper. Because the sticky rice lacked any other traditional ingredients such as salted egg, pulled pork, lap cheung sausage, etc. it was not very satisfying.

I tried the cold bamboo shoots dish and again it lacked any flavour and any kind of sauce or seasoning, in fact, it tasted like it was canned.
The pan-fried Shanghai stuffed buns were one of the few decent dishes, but they were no better than other dim sum restaurants.

For desserts we ordered the milk bread which consisted of two small steamed plain buns and two small golden buns which had a sweet glaze over it. It came with condensed milk to dip the bread in. It was ok, but how can you not screw up this very simple dish.

The restaurant also serves fried fermented tofu, also known as stinky tofu, which a nearby table ordered and the distinctive rotting garbage scent quickly wafted through the restaurant which was pretty off-putting. 

With most of the dishes lacking in much flavour I find it ironic that there were no soy sauce on the tables, only red & black vinegar and chili oil which I used plenty of during my meal. The tea was at least good."}
{"text":"I visited for dinner with family.  We ordered a stir fried rice cake (???) and a few Shanghainese cold dishes and an order of pot stickers (??).  All of us were stunned by how delicious, fresh and exquisite the food was.  

Best - Smoked fish (??) and pot stickers.  The smoked fish at Yu Garden was juicy and a bit softer than the same dish I got at other places, indicating that it was freshly made not so too ago.  The pot stickers had soup inside, even thought they were pan fried.  They were my favourites of the evening.  

Good-  Rice cake and soy sauce duck (??).  The soy sauce duck was meaty, lean and not oily at all.  The sauce was boldly flavoured but there wasn't much flavour in the meat.  The rice cake was skillfully stir fried.  The texture was firm but in a nice way.  The flavour was delicate.  I sprinkled salt onto it myself.

Okay - Jellyfish (??). There were too much shredded toppings that their textures overshadowed the natural texture of the jellyfish.  Furthermore, there was a slight sour taste in the dressing.

Dessert - Souffle Egg White Balls with Red Bean Paste (????).  These balls were freshly made per order, so they came out round and puffy, exactly the way they were supposed to be.  I really enjoyed them.  They were the second best I have ever had in Toronto.  I realize that I am paying for the culinary skills not the ingredients.  I still think they are a bit expensive at $8 for 4 balls.  

Decoration is nice.  Services are attentive and professionally.  It reflects the higher end status of this restaurant.  I like Yu Garden overall.  I feel comfortable to entertain friends and guests who enjoy Shanghainese food here."}
{"text":"Service:
My server only knew mandarin, so I had a hard time communicating with her. She had to flag the manager to take my order.

Ambiance:
The restaurant is pretty new and spacious. It was quite hard to find/enter the plaza as it's located on a weird part of Bayview. You also can't make a left turning into the plaza if you are coming north on Bayview.

Food:
The food in general was ok. I went there to only the Xiao Lung Bao where you have to drink the soup from the straw first. You can't find this at most Shanghai restaurants in Toronto. It was a fun experience, but in the end it was just a overpriced bun. :("}
{"text":"The poorest dining experience I've ever had for years, and this was the first time ever I had never left any tips, firstly we've been waiting in line for 20 mins, which we don't mind and giving this is a fairly new res, but no one was greeting us or give us any number and then they ends up confusing them-self of which one comes first, then we waited 45 mins for our XIAO long bao to come....taste is not bad but not impressed as well, ??? is definitely a No no, looks like homemade....and it also taste like too much cooking wine was put in the soup as well, then our ?????is stir fried....not even in the hot bowl which supposed to be and the dish is cold!!! Or I should say not warm at all!!!!.... And the most funnest thing is I ask the waiter for the vinegar for the xiaolongbao, and the response is\"steal from the table beside u\" Lmao, so to sum up, worst Chinese res ever, definitely not recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

The lovely dumplings. You can even try the mega dumplings! The dishes are Shanghai inspired and include flavours that aren't too spicy. 

The dumplings had a lot of juice inside and they also had interesting versions of the dumpling too. So other than the typical pork dumplings, they had spicy dumpling, veggie dumpling and even truffle oil dumpling. 

I honestly think that sticking with the traditional siao lung bao dumpling is the best. Full of flavour and the meat was very tender and soft. 

Their red braised pork noodle was also very good. Too bad there's no veggies in the soup noodle though or else this dish would be a great dish to have on its own as a meal! The pork hock meat was very tender though. Layers of fat alternate with the meat and each cube was nicely cooked!

LAST TIP?!

If you sign up with their membership card, you get member pricing. So ask them about it if you live around the area and will see yourself going here often. The mega dumpling has a lot of juice and it's really hot, so be careful slurping the juice!!!"}
{"text":"If you came here because you Googled \"giant xiao long bao\" and were hoping for something great, then you're not in the right place. There were only 2-3 options for the giant xlb, and none of them were the classic pork, which confused me since that's the one I assumed most people would have liked to try. We ended up ordering the crab one, and while it was significantly larger than your average xlb, it wasn't that good. I felt that the soup base lacked flavour and that the meat was just meh. If you want the Instagram pic, then sure. Otherwise, it's super overpriced for what's basically a big dumpling. 

If you're wondering why I gave four stars though (it's actually a 3.5 and I'm still waiting on Yelp to implement those half stars into their system), it's because all the other food we ordered was actually really good. I think we got four other items, but it's been a while so I can't remember all of them. We got the beef wrapped foil, Shanghai noodles, pan fried dumplings, and some chicken dish. Although I came in here not expecting too much, I was surprised at how solid every dish was. They were all flavourful and decently sized. 

Service was okay. A little slow, but we had come in about two hours before closing, I believe. Prices were slightly higher than other places, but nothing so outrageous that I'd feel the need to dock points for."}
{"text":"There was a post about the jumbo soup dumpling from this restaurant so we decided to come here to try it out. We also ordered the original soup dumplings, onion pancake with beef, and Shanghai fried noodles. I didn't really like the soup dumplings it was really doughy in my opinion. The jumbo was even more disappointing since it was thicker and inside was literally only soup, barely any meat at all. The pictures definitely looked better than how it actually tasted. We came here pretty early for dinner during a weekday, so it wasn't busy. Keeping that in mind, the servers did not even tend to our table. We had to remind them to give us menus and flag them down to order. It seemed like there were a few regulars though, the servers kept talking to them all night and ignored everyone else in the restaurant. Overall, based on the experience I had here, I probably won't be coming back."}
