{"text":"Wonderful Neighborhood Eats

If you are a Lakewoodian like me who is on a tight budget but still wants to treat the family to a lunch or dinner, this is the place to go. The cooks are wonderful, polite & excellent at their craft, the prices are very fair, the portions are awesome. But last and definitely not least, it is a very clean and tidy restaurant - you can watch them cook your food at the counter and they are more than happy to chat with you as it cooks. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars... they certainly deserve many kudos! Whether you live in Lakewood or the Cleveland westside area, go check this restaurant out. I guarantee that you will leave happy, full & satisfied! =)"}
{"text":"The shawarma is good! But it can be very greasy and salty at times!! 
I like their garlic sauce!! Yum!!
The place runs like a fast food place, but they do have a dine-in area!!
The menu is a little over priced, given the food portion!!
Overall, a good place for decent shawarma! Worth the try."}
{"text":"I love finding hole-in-the-wall secrets like this little gem!

The place was so affordable and their menu items were the perfect go-tos for lunch! You can even have breakfast whenever, it's served all day!

I ordered the turkey club which was HUGE and came with a nice helping of fries and got a bottled drink all under $8.00. I saved half the sandwich for dinner. 

Literally, the reviews aren't lying. If you want great prices and great food check out Ferris, it won't dissapoint!"}
{"text":"Really good hamburgers, onion rings, fries and garlic mayo for dipping fries or on the burgers...maybe both!. 

Saw good reviews on Yelp and needed carry out dinner for the family at 9:30 pm. It was ready for pick-up in 15 minutes. The owners' name is Ferris, very friendly, prompt, proud of his cooking and his establishment.  

Each 8 oz. burger with fries was $7.50.  We all had bacon cheeseburgers, with grilled onions, one with swiss, another mozzarella, and lastly cheddar.  The burgers included lettuce, tomato, and garlic mayo on a very fresh puffy bun.  We all loved it!

Yes, go there and give him a try! 

He has all kinds of breakfast (available all day long), lunch and dinner selections.  There are about 5 booths inside and 4 or 5 tables outside. It's not fancy but it was clean and welcoming.

We are looking forward to going back and try more of his food!


PS:  The menu is online--www.ferrisdeli.net"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get shawarma. Super authentic taste. Great portions. Reasonable price. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for some middle eastern cuisine, or someone looking for that unique \"hole in the wall\" gem to recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was greasy and disgusting  and the staff was too rude!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Great Shawerma. I tried it for the first time last week based on many recommendations from my friends.  I had chicken shawerma, it is tasty and close to the taste that I am familiar with in Middle East.  The only thing I don't recommend is not to have it  dipped in the fat dripping from the skewer and then briefly seared against the flame, because I had it this way and was a bit kind of heavy meal"}
{"text":"I'm from California, and have tried many different shawarma sandwiches like Zankous, and this has to be one of the best I've had. It's on par or better than Doner Kebab from Germany and Dubai."}
{"text":"yum!! recommended to my husband by coworkers. definitely worth the drive from shaker heights. meat is seasoned beautifully and they really know how to use the spit to get a great cook on the meat, too. also had the kibbeh: crunchy bulgur crust and delicious filling. very happy tummy."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I especially love the chicken shawarma platter with the garlic sauce. Very tasty, but I feel that when you order carry out, the portions are kind of lacking for the price... looking at some of these pics, if you eat it there it looks like they pile on a little more shawarma! Plus I didn't like the vibe of the workers really... they seemed a little rude in my opinion. plus the guy upcharged me! I was charged 9 bucks for the platter when according to the menu it's $8.50. I know it's only 50 cents, but its the principle of the matter! If the food wasn't so tasty, I'd take away at least one, maybe two stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Everything on the menu is very, very good. Best shawarma I've found in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome! Fast delivery, and to be honest the hummus may be even better than Aladdin's. I could not find an actual storefront for this place, so it may be that the hummus is made in a bathtub in someone's house. Sometimes the best things in life are better left a mystery."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in town. Best Shawerma, shish Tawook and fried chicken so far."}
{"text":"At the end of The Avengers (2012), Tony Stark invites earth's mightiest superheroes to get shawarma.  If the film had taken place in Cleveland, he probably would have taken them to Ferris, because Tony Stark only likes the best things in life.  The food is fantastic, reasonably priced, and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Shawarma paradise right here. 

Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to treat yourself to a delicious shawarma if you are in the Lakewood area. My go-to is the Beef Shawarma, and there are exactly 3 things that make this the best one in town:

1. Shawarma Meat = tender, succulent, and perfectly seasoned. Fresher than the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

2. Shawarma Wrap = Cleanest wrap ever. Not a single drop of oil or sauce found dribbling out of the wrap. This wrapping wins 1st place in being Most Compact, Simple, and Stable - coincidentally the same exact qualities you may desire in a camping tent.

3. Hello, Pickles! If the Shawarma is a treasure hunt, then these pickles are pure gold. These little guys are a wonderful bite of balance to the savory taste inherent to the meat preparation. Go find them in your wrap on your next Ferris Shawarma adventure!"}
{"text":"The best Shaworma ever. I highly recommend it. Next time I should try something else. I'm sure I won't regret it."}
{"text":"Wow this place was the real deal. I have not found food like in a long time. The Shwamma's were to die for and huge. We got one Chicken and one Beef and both amazing. The owner was very helpful. And the best way to decide if it is good the city workers stop here! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This little place is definitely worth your money. A very affordable menu and some of the food is amazing. My boyfriend loved his gyro and my falafel was awesome (the guy working there was Syrian so it makes sense!). I say \"some of the food\" because the fries with them were probably from a bag and were very unimpressive. My house salad was mostly iceberg lettuce and cheese, nothing special. However, for the price and experience, it's still a good place and I recommend it for a cheap and overall good meal."}
{"text":"Excellent shawarma - Lebanese Syrian style shawarma / halal meat - I always go for take out . The place is tiny has only few tables (3-4) the ambience is not inviting , it is a place to go for the Arabic food or for take out 5/5 but not for a dine out or hanging with friends - 
Good food"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! Looks like nothing from the outside, but I wouldn't be lying if I told you Ferris has the best Middle Eastern food this side of the Atlantic. I highly recommend the chicken shawarma platter that comes with fries, garlic sauce (heaven), pickles, and chili sauce. Large portions that are great to take home for leftovers. We also love their kippeh and fried chicken (seriously!). Prices are very reasonable, two full dinners is around $15. There is a large beverage selection (all non- alcoholic) and it is fun to try the different Middle Eastern drinks. Even my Middle Eastern boyfriend thinks the food is amazing! I am very happy to support a local business like Ferris', and will continue to come here and send my friends here. 

P.S. try to carpool if possible, there isn't a ton of lot parking, but there are nearby street spots if need be"}
{"text":"This place is very reasonably priced and has above average food, great for what you pay!  Though the quality of the food has been sporadic at times, I'm still a frequenter.  It does stink that they aren't open on Sundays anymore but ce la vie.  Large menu with a lot to offer and I love that they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation of a friend who said it tasted like he was in Damascus and said that Ferris had come from Syria about a year ago. Was not disappointed!

Got the chicken shawarma wrap and platter, and everything was annihilated quickly. The flavors were excellent, the wrap was well-toasted, and the meat was savory. The prices are very reasonable, and dinner for two ran about $15. The staff members were very friendly, and our food was ready five minutes after ordering, even though there were multiple groups in the restaurant. Already planning the return trip to check out the desserts and the beef shawarma!"}
{"text":"Hard to add on to the other reviews.

Wife and I ordered a beef shawarma platter and a chicken shawarma platter.
Both were delicious and well-portioned."}
{"text":"Their Shwarma is fantastic. Tastes pretty good. 
Can make it better with cooking it little more and it is little pricey."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! All the shawarmas, hummus, kifta balls, fries, all awesome! Had take out, FYI, but nothing bad to say"}
{"text":"I really love finding places like this. One of those hole-in-the-wall, locally owned restaurants that may not be much to look at but have seriously awesome food. 

In a somewhat strange location on Lakewood Hts Blvd, Ferris kind of looks more like an auto body shop than a restaurant. Kind of grungy, with an obnoxious striped awning. Go inside and there's funky old maroon carpet and booths and bright kelly green and yellow paint on the walls. The ambiance is well... you get the idea. 

But the food... that's where Ferris shines.

The menu consists of breakfast, lunch and dinner and nothing is over $10.  You'll find your basics like burgers and wraps, but you will also find Mediterranean selections like Falafel and Shish Tawook. I definitely want to check out the fried chicken (4 pcs plus sides for $8.99!), I bet it's good.

I opted for the bacon, egg and cheese croissant sandwich. It was huge and the croissant was nice and fluffy and real. Not like those fake bread-like impostors. Basic and good. I wasn't really hungry, otherwise I would have gotten a monster omelet like my companions. It looked great. 

While you won't want to go to Ferris for interior decorating tips, you will definitely want to go for the great food."}
{"text":"The shawarma here is the among the best I have ever had. I get the mixed shawarma with chicken and beef. Comes with garlic mayo, fries, and is absolutely delicious. The staff is very courteous and welcoming and the restaurant is very clean with someone from staff circulating frequently to wipe down the tables. I will continue to keep going back. Looking forward to trying the fried chicken which I hear is also amazing."}
{"text":"Me as a person who loves shawerma sooooo much I must say that they make the yummiest shawerma in the entire world hahha . I always take chicken shawerma place ( shawerma sandwich divided into pieces ) and the garlic mayooooooo is a master thing ,
My husband also take chicken pieces it's nice as well but I can't eat high a chicken so I order shawerma ."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma  i ate it today ,it look like my country shawarma,good stuff,good service ,i really enjoy it"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a short visit when someone suggested this place for shawarma. The shawarma was outstanding. Best I have ever had. Very authentic. I live in Detroit where we have hundreds of middle eastern eateries. So far the shawarma at Ferris  is better than all the places in Detroit"}
{"text":"Great local spot. The interior is nice and clean and the staff is friendly. Menu is simple so you don't have to worry about picking the wrong thing. The shawarma is great - freshly and authentically prepared. Their little almond puddings are delicious too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say I had to drop the star-rating a bit due to some issues I've run into with Ferris Deli recently...

1) Hours--I'm constantly doing what I can to update hours on Yelp listings, mostly because I know that seasons in NEO can be a good reason to adjust daily hours. But there is no excuse for a business leaving hours on their website and other online profiles that are incorrect. The only reason I found out they weren't open was because I was repeatedly calling them around lunch time for days to try to place an order. No answer, dark windows, no automated answering system to confirm hours, nothing. 

2) Another time I called they said they weren't delivering. Don't brag about your delivery services and then not follow through."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was located next to La Plaza Supermarket and their fantastic tacos! I am a fan of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food so I decided to check Ferris out one evening. This place is very unassuming, but I saw customers outside, inside, and customers picking up to-go orders so I say that is a good sign! The lady who helped me decide what to get was friendly and patient. 

Apparently the shawarma platters used to come with coleslaw, garlic paste, hot sauce, pickles, fries, and a meat roll, but I was told they no longer do the coleslaw since not many people ate it and instead just do double garlic paste. The kind lady behind the counter let me get hummus instead of double garlic paste and she let me get half beef and half chicken. Definitely appreciate a place that works with me on trying different things without having to order a bunch of meals! I also opted for a baklava roll and my bill came to $10.50. 

The platter is a pretty generous portion size, like pretty sure a whole basket of fries was included! They are of the frozen variety, but eh, still edible especially when dipped in that wonderful garlic paste mmm. I also really liked the meat roll, both the chicken and the beef. Nothing was dried up or over cooked at all, instead flavorful and tender. The hummus however, not so good. Tasted like a plain chickpea and I left it alone after a couple bites (definitely needs some more lemon or garlic or something to add flavor). That Baklava roll was pretty tasty though!

Overall I would come here again. Not the healthiest of meals, but good and the price is right. Portion size is big and I have leftovers in my fridge.



***Update, you can get coleslaw again, you just have to ask for it."}
{"text":"We ordered the shawarmas but there wasn't as much of the sauce/seasoning/herbs as the last time we ordered them, so I would say it is pretty inconsistent in terms of food preparation..The meat was drier the 2nd time we came and the wrap was also dry/lacking taste compared to before. Service is good and prompt, polite. Decent ambience. Sometimes packed so it's hard to find parking. Overall may come back again"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this restaurant so, my boyfriend & I decided to come here for lunch. We were greeted as soon as we got there & was handed 2 little menus. I was under the impression that this was a deli as well but when I looked on the menu, they just had middle eastern food. Fine by me!

I ordered the chicken shawarma platter & my boyfriend ordered the beef shawarma platter. Each platter comes with your choice of shawarma, garlic sauce, pickles, cole slaw, & a big handful of fries. I really enjoyed my chicken shawarma. The chicken was very flavorful & had the perfect amount of seasoning. I dipped it into the garlic sauce to even amp up the flavor. The fries were so good too! My boyfriend enjoyed his beef shawarma a lot as well. For 2 shawarma platters ($8.50 each) & 2 crush sodas, it came out to $20. I think it was a good deal considering that you get a decent sized platter!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Shawarma place. The Shawarma is authentic and on the stick thing like it is in the Middle East/Africa. The garlic sauce is great as well!"}
{"text":"kabob samich. yep I had to have it. for $8.50 (pricey) I got a pita bread, two little thing of fattening-gooey-delicious garlic sauce, some lettuce and diced tomatoes, fries and prepared kabob meat in sausage shape. It's gets three star from me because, well, it's prepared kabobs not actually pieces of meat. Also because, in my humble opinion, for $8.50, I expect more than the assembling of prepared food which I still have to assemble before it gets to my mouth. The taste is there but the price is not."}
{"text":"Some of the best shawirma we ever had, including Dearborn, MI.  The wrap is thin enough where you actually enjoy the sandwich and has a savory taste to die for. Thr garlic sauce is 100 percent real garlic, and ii can just eat it by itself with bread, it is so good.  We spent $35 bucks and got three lunches! The freshness of the sweets also is remarkable.  All the food was served in to go menus within 10 min. Impressive. Most definitely a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"Seems like a pretty tasty option for food, but credit cards are not accepted for delivery. Cash only for deliveries. How is that a thing? Their website doesn't work which makes ordering anything kind of difficult."}
{"text":"Ive got a problem. I just ate there at lunch. Took a picture and sent to the wife. Now we are having Shawarma for dinner got a takeout order for 7:30 pickup. . It is about the 7th time Ive been there now personally. A Lebanese (just moved here)  co-worker took me to Ferris and introduced me to this fabulous place. He said \"This is the second best Shawarma he has ever had in his life. The other one is a 5 foot by 5 foot place in Lebanon that is only open a few hours a day. So I guess I will have to stick with this place.  The food is consistently amazing. The garlic sauce is absolutely amazing. Ive had the beef, the chicken Shawarma, the Wings, the salad, Falafel, Every single thing in this place is great. They need to take over their neighbor and make this place bigger. I absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean cuisine, make sure to try the fried chicken with garlic sauce, and don't forget the shawarma and falafel."}
{"text":"Excellent! Try it! Must try! If you miss authentic middle eastern food, this is the place to go! I love it!"}
{"text":"I agree that the fries are just meh, but the shawarma...so good! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Lakewood and know most of the little best-kept-secrets about it.  However this one avoided my radar for some time until recently.  I found it when I moved back to Lakewood in September and it happened to be directly across the street from me.  The inside decor is nothing to write home about, but the food surely is.  The y have gyros, wings, burgers, etc, etc.  They even deliver!  The best part about this place is the cost.  SO CHEAP!  My mother even said it was the best gyro of her life when she tried it.  They have food ready in just minutes and they load up on their offering of fries.  All in all, I say this place rocks."}
{"text":"I get the beef shawarma platter (Arabic style) and it is phenomenal. Best shawarma in Cleveland. Tip: mix a bit of the red sauce into the white! The guy who worked behind the counter was also kind and food came out at a good time."}
{"text":"Best and only place to go to for shawarmas in Cleveland! Always call and check for hours and stick To shawarmas (the knafeh and fries are not too good)"}
{"text":"Ferris is a food god. I would ask for his steak philly wrap as my last meal on death row. I've had authentic philly cheesesteaks that can't compare to Ferris' creation. It's perfectly grilled with a little crispness, good quality meat well cooked, gooey cheese in every bite and something that kicks in at the end that makes you go oh kick me again right there.

It's not a place for self-important foodies in the slightest. this place very much has that neighborhood vibe where the guy that cooks your food is also the guy that pays the bills and cleans the grill between orders. But it's delicious, greasy and welcoming to the point that wearing a coat while dining in is an expected inconvenience I'll happily accept to devour my favorite cheesesteak of all time. 

This is the only place I normally tip 50-100% of my bill. If this place is not in my life, the world would be a gray soulless cavern of injustice."}
{"text":"Ferris is a Good Egg. I may be biased because it's within a 1-minute walk of my house, but it's solid take-out at pretty reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem that I had no idea existed.  Portion sizes are pretty large so don't make the same mistake I did and order too much. All of the food was extremely tasty. Just a heads up, the ordering process is a little different. You walk in, order with the guy at the counter, then go sit. You get your own drinks out of the cooler and you pay for everything at the end. Kind of has a New York style deli vibe if you are eating in. Not the fanciest place by any means, but the great food makes you forget everything else."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Cleveland to eat hands down my favorite shawarma in the area. Must stop! I could eat this daily."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in town! Great service, generous portions! Food to die for !! Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Not sure what was amazing at this place for many people. I cannot say I was impressed that much. I had beef shawarma wrap for $7.50. My sandwich was probably the thinnest that I ever had at all other places. The taste was just OK, nothing impressive. The restaurant looks clean, but they will wear gloves and turn the meat with their gloved hands, and then get your money with the same gloved hand, and then make another sandwich with the same gloved hand...

These reviews seems to be working against the customers. They take advantage of these reviews to increase their prices. I had triple size sandwich at a lower price at other places. 

I do not think I will come back to this place again."}
{"text":"A good showorma in a sad place, it reminds my of home."}
{"text":"This place has really good chicken and beef shawarmas. Everything is super fresh and I could tell that cleanliness was a priority for the owner. I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat for lunch and dinner. I also had their fattoush and it was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been searching for good middle eastern food since leaving the eastern side of Michigan- and I think I found a good option at Ferris Deli!

We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm and it actually surprisingly got busy after we ordered. All their options are extremely affordable- we opted to share a chicken shawarma platter. 

It was actually a very decent size. They have the meats rotating in front of the fires (so you know it's legit), and I watched them cut off our meat. When we got our platter, they actually wrapped the meat into a shawarma wrap and had cut it up into bite size pieces. A little different than I had expected (I was expecting to just get the meat), but that works too.

It also came with a heaping side of hot fries and garlic sauce. I loveeeeeee garlic sauce, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the large portion of garlic sauce they gave. Also, there's hot sauce and pickles too.

It was a good size meal to split between the two of us. Was it the best chicken shawarma I've had? It's hard to compare to Dearborn restaurants, so no, but I did think it was still very good. Was it the best garlic sauce I've had? It wasn't the spicy garlic I like, but it still was pretty decent!

So if you have a craving and don't want to drive three hours to Dearborn, I suggest you check out Ferris Deli. It'll be nice on your stomach and your wallet too."}
{"text":"Amazing food, stopped in on our way to Chicago and it didn't disappoint. Got the beef shawarma and falafel platters, highly recommend!!  Friendly service"}
{"text":"My friends have been coming to Ferris for around a decade and are on first name basis with the owner. I have tried pieces of their shawarma when they ordered take out in the past and was pleased with the meal. Yesterday was my first experience dining in and ordering the platter. The menu at Ferris has been tightened up and they eliminated burgers etc... The shawarma is good enough to be the main featured dish. Ferris made a half beef, half chicken so I could try both meats."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food. Always fresh. Try everything, except the fries. Fries are the only thing that sucks. But why would you go there and get fries? Really?"}
{"text":"I've been walking past this place for years. Never really spoke to me. Was walking pooch under I-90 the other day and saw a menu for it on the ground. It was a sign. Went back the same night to get hummus, falafel and shish tawouk. All were affordably priced, generously heaped into to go containers and damn delicious. Main entrees even came with great fries. Cute dining space and crazy ornate spinning meat oven things. A neighborhood gem. There is a great selection of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean options on Lorain road, but this is like our very own south central Lakewood spot. Terrific!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. Sat on the patio which is really cute. You order at the counter and wait for your food. Very basic middle eastern cuisine but truly authentic. Nice staff. Water is bottled and needs to be purchased."}
{"text":"This place is a dive.  With some great food inside.  Located about a block or so from La Plaza it has a tiny parking lot.  I counted 6 spaces.  7 if you include the handicap spot.  It's worth the hassle to get into.

I ordered the salad with shawarma.  $12.  I thought it was a bit steep for a  salad.  But I went with it.  I was told I could get chicken or beef shawarma.  The nice gentleman pointed at the spits behind him.  Those have to be the largest spits of meat I've ever seen!  They have to make those in house.  They are simply huge.  I asked for the chicken and someone started to carve the chicken off the spit right away.

I was given the salad on a paper plate with a plastic fork.  Once I started to get into the salad it was really like eating through a mountain of salad.  I took a picture to show what I'm talking about.  Everything in the salad was chopped into really small pieces.  I really like that as I like chopped salad.  Small pieces of romaine, onion, cucumber, tomato, parsley, pita chips.  Tossed in a fresh dressing that was tart.  So this is a fattoush salad.  With fresh cut chicken shawarma on top.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned shawarma and was tender on one side.  Crispy on the other.  

Hands down this may be one of the best fattoush salads in town.  I have to return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Good diner food. Great prices. Friendly owners! And they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't be nicer if they called it Ferris Bueller Restaurant! Anyways, they make good  Shawarma sandwiches here. I heard the broasted fried chicken is the best here. 

To really appreciate it, you should know how authentic shawarma is originally prepared and how it tastes like. I tried shawarma in so many cities like Houston, Chicago, El-Lay, NYC, Montreal, Boston....etc. Cedar and Phoenicia in Houston and Micho in DC were amazing!. But this place is something else. From my perspective; a good shawarma sandwich is made of a soft fresh thin pita bread, skinny flakes of tender juicy well-seasoned roasted chicken, good vibrant garlic sauce, vinegary salty-ish cucumber pickles and pomegranate molasses. That's it! All other additions are just blasphemy. My only beef about the sandwich was it lacked the usual greasiness.  Yes! It's supposed to be a little greasy which is not healthy but that's how it is.  

Came to visit my good ol' friends in Cleveland, Ohio. I was already so happy to see my friends, such fantastic lovely amazing humans.  But coming here made my visit ecstatic! This place is authentic to the bones. The owner was so kind when I told him I haven't had this meal in a long time and he might've made it a special order for us. I'm glad I don't live nearby, otherwise I would seriously need daily P90X.

Atmosphere is very humble and not fancy.   So this is not for a date. It works perfectly for a happy group of friends.

P.S.: do not eat shawarma early in the day..It will be oily and burnt. The meat will be better roasted as the day progresses."}
{"text":"We just moved into our new house and my parents surprised us with dinner from this place. This is authentic Arabic food. Yum. The hummus was so smooth and had a great flavor. The chicken shawerma was perfect and I could eat the garlic sauce that came with it every day with every meal (but I bet my husband wouldn't be thrilled if I did that). There only thing I could have done without were the fries.. Definitely out of a bag and not great. But... Just don't order fries.. Do order the Arabic food. I will totally be making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"*WARNING* shwarma eating at Ferris Shwarma may have side effects such as: desire for seconds, an overwhelming love for the staff, intense garlic breath, and, in some cases, full blown shwarma addiction, otherwise known as FBSA. 
But seriously, why have none of my Yelp peeps told me about this wonderful eatery? I was having a down in the dumps kind of day- a combination of work stress, winter weather and being hangry. Being long overdue for my lunch hour, I need something to be quickly delivered to my stomach. The thing about takeout eateries is that you often have that awkward feeling of, \"should I be eating in here?\" 
Not the case with Ferris! I felt more than warmly welcomed by the handsome gentleman manning the front. I wasn't quite sure what to order and he was quick to recommend the beef/chicken shwarma combo. He also kindly explained how their platters are served, which was super helpful. Being overly hangry as I was, I also ordered a dessert and took my pick from the beverage cooler in the back (which is well stocked by the way). The kind gentleman was eager to let me enjoy my food before paying, again making me feel really welcome. As I was sitting and waiting, I made conversation with some other patrons, who bragged of visiting a few times a week. After tasting the shwarma, I had no question as to why that would be. This shwarma is legit people. As someone who isn't always the biggest fan of this dish as I usually find it's overloaded with parsley (which I enjoy, but the flavor can be really overpowering) and also the pita/meat ratio is often out of whack. Ferris Shwarma does it right though: the shwarma is most perfectly rolled so you get the perfect bite every time. There's a light layer of parsley and sauce, but the star is the meat, which has a great balance of crispy and juicy, somehow without being too oily. The crispy bits really sent me into shwarma heaven, and when I combined it with the garlic and hot sauce it is served with, I was left thinking to myself I'd love to eat this every day of my life. Fries and pickles are served alongside, making this a great value at just about $10. My only small criticism is that the fries lacked seasoning, I do wish they were served with some zaatar or other seasoning, but I think they are served plain because many people may want to dip them in the provided sauces. As mentioned, I also tried a dessert, the warbat, which is a sort of cheese pastry surrounded by phyllo dough. It was perfectly light and airy, with just a touch of sweetness. Was this homeade? I'd like to think so, but the truth is I don't care. It was the delicious crescendo to my meal, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. 
So did I mention how awesome the service is? As I was about to leave, I saw literal swarms of people flowing in, some for eat in, some for take out, making me feel like this place is some sort of Lakewood secret I'm only just now finding out about. I can't wait to come back, and it'll be top on my list next time I'm in a hangry mood!"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious!!! We will visit again. Chicken shawarma was great and the kunefe was 100/100"}
