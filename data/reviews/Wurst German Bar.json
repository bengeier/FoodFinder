{"text":"I agree with the name! If you like a metric ton of bread with a mediocre bratwurst... This is the place for you!  At least you can listen to the bartenders and servers bitch about their coworkers while you select from their extensive selection of authentic \"old country\" German brews like - Corona light, Amstel, Guinness and bud light!  Scheisse!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best place to eat within the airport.  I wasn't too much of a fan of the hamburger but the bratwurst was quite good and the service was especially friendly. next time I'm there, I'll try the \"gourmet\" gingerale -to be adventurous of course"}
{"text":"7 bucks for a few spoonfuls of chili, and the bartender Anne P. Could not have been less engaged with anything.  Not one smile to anyone, and left the bar unattended multiple times for several minutes.   Why is this ok with anyone associated with this place?"}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost. Food is very expensive, cold, and greasy. Any place else in the airport is preferable"}
{"text":"Great place to just grab a beer.  They have spotted cow on tap."}
{"text":"stopping here is out of necessity.  As in.... my united flight is delayed again.. i will grab a drink and a brat.  Service is friendly and drinks are cold but that is all this place has to offer"}
{"text":"Honestly, it's the airport so you should not expect too much.  In this case however, do not expect anything including being treated fairly.  As a frequent flier, I have utilized this restaurant a few times, mostly to grab a drink while waiting for a flight.  Often, the male bartender would not even acknowledge my presence, choosing to serve the white customers until I actually said something.  Only then would he get me a drink and scowl at me the entire time.  At first, I thought it was just in my head; however, after a few more trials, this appears to be the status-quo.  But, hey, maybe it's just this guy...you have jerks regardless of where you go.    Today, I had an early morning flight, and I went up to the bar as I wanted to order some breakfast.  I was unsure whether to just take a seat or not.  Even though I was there first, the waitress looked at me and immediately went to a table where some other (white) customers were sitting down.  I thought, \"Maybe I should sit down then.\"  I waived at her to let her know I was sitting down and would place an order when she had a second.  Instead of coming over to me, she went and took the orders of another (white) couple that sat down at least 5 minutes after I sat down.  What the heck?  Well, I finally flagged her down again, and ordered my food.  It took awhile, and like everyone else has commented, the food is absolute trash...seriously.  \"Breakfast potatoes\" are just tater tots here, eggs are cold and disgusting, and instead of bringing the requested wheat bread, they brought white.  Surprise, surprise...  The best part was at the end, when she dropped the bill on my table.  I took out my credit card and signaled that I was ready to pay considering my flight was getting ready to board.  I waited a few minutes and watched her take other customers' payments whose bill she dropped off after mine, while I sat there and waited.  I finally had to get up and go to the counter, and she finally rang me up for the \"meal.\"  What a horrible experience at a horrible restaurant with horrible people working there.    Nice to see that the German ideals from the 1930's and 1940's are still alive and well in Dane County International Airport."}
{"text":"After eating at the Essen Haus, this place is not comparable. I had the braut which was horrible compared to some of the bomb ones in Madison, and the Ruben. The Ruben was half bad but it's so commonplace that I forgot about it. My buddy and I also had a giant beer (Spotted Cow?) and that was really good but it was forgettable really compared to the delicious other beers I had in Madison."}
{"text":"I just paid $15 for a mostly-empty tortilla filled with some chicken, a few peppers, and cold sliced American cheese.  Cold American cheese. In a quesadilla. In Wisconsin.  I know this is an airport, but have some dignity, people."}
{"text":"This is like the name... the worst. I had huevos rancheros. The guacamole seemed fake or at least some version that was not fresh. The salsa which they called tomatillo salsa was actually something like Jarred Pace red salsa. The refried beans tasted like a lower form of canned."}
{"text":"I'll start with don't eat here. The food is pretty terrible given the stuff airport prices. Ordered Rueben - $3 up charge to get a wilted salad with it instead of chips.   The meat in the sandwich was not to be chewed. One bite and all the meet came out in an unappealing wad.   The place had assumed the Great Dane menu - not a good thing given the Great Dane in the airport closed and is being rebranded.   With the Great Dane at the airport. you knew the food wouldn't be good... But you understood it to be non unpalatable.   So $23 for a sandwich and an iced tea all served on and in paper. Why bother. You want a great deli sandwich at an airport? Go to Plum at DTW and for less money you will get a world class deli sandwich.   Eat before you get to the MSN airport."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there was a bit of bad luck with my visit here. Flying out, I had an hour to kill and only a day left where I'd be allowed to drink. (military orders kinda bite that way)  Stopping here, right at my boarding gate, the coolers were down, so I couldn't have one last taste of Great Dane off the tap.   Luckily, the tall standing fridge worked, so I went with a couple Blue Moon's to match my curds, which were standardly solid with ranch on the side.   Service here was good, pricing was typical airport mark-up, but a little disappointed with the tap selection. Worth stopping here for snackage if you're flying out of this gate."}
{"text":"There's a variety of items to choose from...not lots, but there's chicken, a couple of kinds of brats, hot pretzels, cheese curds and fries. There's more, but I don't remember it all.   The stove wasn't working to well, so the Reubens took a bit longer than usual to prepare. Service was pretty quick overall, though.   Prices were pretty good for an airport.   The guy at the counter was a sweetie and professional, as well."}
{"text":"For starters, typical of airports, the prices are unjustifiably over the top.  I had one beer and one bratwurst and the tab was over $20.  They asked me if I wanted to \"upgrade from kettle chips to pub fries,\" but I declined.  In the end, rushed to get on my plane which boarded sooner than I'd expected, I didn't even note that they'd neglected to serve me those kettle chips.  Also, I was asked if I wanted sauerkraut with my brat, and I replied, with humor, \"I'm still in Wisconsin, right?  A brat without sauerkraut is like a smile without a mouth.\"  Both staff smiled and chuckled at my humorous remark.  When it came time to serve the brat, however, I was informed \"I'm sorry, but we're out of sauerkraut.\"  How can a sausage restaurant in Wisconsin be out of sauerkraut at the beginning of the day on a Wednesday?  This was 10:30 in the morning.  The sausage was \"ok,\" but they didn't make it, they just buy them from Usinger, and cook/heat them.  With nothing but some mustard on it (they didn't even offer catsup) it was, frankly, a hurried disappointment.  I don't recommend them, food and drink options were decidedly  better when The Great Dane had a location in the airport.  A sign of the times . . . . .  This place is managed/owned by a giant corporation that has other concessions in the airport, and was the landlord of The Great Dane when they were there.  The more intensely corporate a business is, the less human it becomes, and the less enjoyable it is to spend time, and/or money, there."}
{"text":"I really like the food at this place it is pretty good as far as airport food goes. I always stop in when I am flying out of Madison which is every few months. The good.... They have fried cheese curds ( I do not leave this airport without getting some). The rest of what I have tried here is also good but nothing to really write home about. The Bad.... The prices are really high even for an airport where I expect to pay a little more the cheese curds are around 8 bucks and it is by no means a huge order of them. All of the sandwiches and brats are also very expensive for what you get.  I will keep stopping here because I always need to get a fix of Fried Cheese Curds on my way out of Wisconsin but if it were not for that I would stop on my way to the airport and skip it because of the hight prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited for 30 minutes and still didn't get a menu.  The staff is lazy,  it wasn't even busy. Don't stop here if you need to catch a flight within a couple hours."}
{"text":"The Madison airport isn't a great place to eat, but the Wurst Bar, featuring Usinger's sausages, is probably your best bet -- any of the wursts or the Reuben are fine, as long as you don't mind eating something heavy before your flight.  Certainly beats the subpar airport version of the Great Dane, a packaged sandwich from Ancora, or the unspeakable Quizno's, your other options here.  (The best option, if you've got time, is to stop at Smoky Jon's on the way to the airport and get takeout.)"}
{"text":"This place is just horrid!!!  Very heavily staffed, and they're having a party in the back. Customers are a pain in their ass and are a distraction here. STAY AWAY !!!!  Waitress is hanging in the kitchen having a great time with her coworkers.  About 10 people on staff, one waitress, and she wants to hang with friends chatting with coworkers. Blonde.  Could care less about taking care of customers"}
{"text":"It's always fun to try regional specialties, so thought I would try a bratwurst in Wisconsin.  I neglected to consider the airport aspect of dining, tho, and left kind of disappointed.  I wasn't sure exactly how it was served, so I made sure to ask that it came in a bun, rather than just plain.  I did get a rye hot dog bun (my first time to see this) but it was unwarmed/untoasted.  I got a little sauerkraut and was pretty excited, but it tasted just like something I could have made in my kitchen.  The good part is that I get to cross this off the list, right?"}
{"text":"I found the food at this place laid back restaurant to be even better.  Excellent place to grab a bite between flights."}
