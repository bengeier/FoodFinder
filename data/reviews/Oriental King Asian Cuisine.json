{"text":"Solid take out place - fast, good quality fare at decent prices! Had the Gen Tao Chicken, Steamed Shrimp dumplings and Beef Ho fan - my preferred North York Chinese takeout - no complaints!"}
{"text":"Ordered a number of dishes for dinner on Friday night: Sweet and Sour Chicken Mixed vegetables with almonds Chicken Fried Rice Shanghai Noodles (on the recommendation of other reviewers) Cantonese Chow Mein Wonton Soup Siu Mai Eggplant with Black Bean Sauce (again on recommendation) All dishes were ok. Portion sizes were generous. The vegetable were fresh. But the food all tasted very plain. The Shanghai Noodles, which had been reviewed as spicy, were not at all spicy. Even the sweet and sour chicken balls were blah. Overall, a very plain experience. Where is the great Chinese food that is so desperately needed in North York??? Feel badly about posting this review as this is obviously a small, family run operation. All they need to do is add a little taste to their dishes and things would be much better."}
{"text":"Great take-out at a decent price, slightly more than their competitors. If you're lucky you can get coupons to bring the price in-line with their competitors.   The food itself is quite good, probably 3.5 stars. The ingredients are always fresh and everything always seems well-cooked (eg, the meat isn't dry, etc.). This is more than can be said about most hole-in-the-wall Chinese take-out places!  I don't have much bad to say, except that the flavor doesn't really rate above a 3.5. Everything is well cooked and fresh, but there isn't a lot of taste, which is strange considering everything I've said above. Decent size portions. Overall the food has a light touch, which can be good or bad depending on your mood. I do sometimes get hungry an hour or two after eating their food, which probably means they use less oil and grease than other places - a good thing, to be sure!  One bad thing is that because there isn't much flavor, it's hard to distinguish their dishes from each other - chicken/beef this tastes very similar to chicken/beef that."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 5/5 according to delivery expectations. I was looking for a quick fix with a bunch of deadlines on hand. Their Lunch Special didn't make it hard for me to give them a try. I ordered about 6 dishes and came just around $40 including delivery and tips.  Their service was prompt, food was fresh - including the noodles, which is pretty hard to come by these days when you compare the price units on OrientK's menu in the delivery side of the restaurant business in its neighbourhood. This is a restaurant who appreciates customer loyalty.   Their flavours won't disappoint you either. c: Did I mention food portions are really generous? D:"}
{"text":"Our order:  - Spicy Crispy Beef - CAD 10.95 -  Fried Crispy Wonton - CAD 6.95 - House Fried Rice- CAD 10.95 - Chili Chicken CAD 10.95 -- Total Order: CAD 47.23  Spicy Crispy Beef:  Neither spicy nor crispy.  The batter was soggy and was more like a thick fish n' chip type batter, the beef tasted like 2 day old roast beef and it was cut very thick.  There was also no sauce on this dish at all.  Ended up throwing this out.  Fried Crispy Wonton:  There was no wonton, just a small blob of something resembling beef jerky - hard and chewy.  House Fried Rice:  This was the only real edible dish (besides the appetizer) that we could stomach.  Had lots of pork, beef, shrimp and vegetables.  Rice was cooked typical of a great north american chinese takeout.  It was delicious and the serving was great.  Chilli Chicken:  They should call this dish \"Salty Chicken\"  It was ridiculous how much salt was on this dish, and yet there seemed to be no chilli or chillies to be found anywhere.  Ended up throwing this dish out.  Ordered through just-eat.ca and the delivery time was good and driver was friendly.  However, we basically paid 55.00 (includes tip) for fried rice and crispy wontons.  I don't even understand how this place is in business with all of the great chinese restaurants in Toronto.  I would never waste my money here again."}
{"text":"This place is as great as its name is terrible, which is very. I've never stepped foot inside but we've ordered takeout and delivery a gazillion times and it always hits the spot (the let's-not-cook, sweet-and-sour, can't-stop-eating-even-though-I'm-full-already, oh-what-there-are-still-fortune-cookies? Chinese food spot).  Good dinner combos, delicious lo mein, fabulous egglplant (especially when paired with the fried rice), fresh when it comes to your front door, and there's always enough for leftovers.  Service is solid. In fact, we once made an error in thinking THEY'D made an error, and they were still helpful. Sorry.  PRO TIP #1: 10% off pickup if you pay in cash.  PRO TIP #2: Do you like crying and rinsing your mouth out with almond milk and the sensation of spice settling into your tongue for eternity? Get the Shanghai noodles."}
{"text":"We just ordered from here online. Delivery took an hour and 45 minutes, which was thankfully spent in worthwhile manner watching John Carter of Mars. It's likely the inflated time was due to Ice Storm problems, so I won't let it affect the score, but I thought it worth noting.  Otherwise, I have no complaints. We were happy they offered a Dumpling appetizer (please don't be upset Dumpling King and Queen, they don't come close). The Lo Mein wasn't advertised as spicy, but they most certainly were. The Seafood fried rice was tasty, and the Eggplant in Black Bean sauce was a highlight for me. Great American-style Chinese food for this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious, consistent, artery-clogging Chinese food. Some of the items and portions are different from what you might expect - the chow mein comes with fourteen pounds of bell peppers and onions, and one order of deep fried won tons could easily kill a family of four - but this is definitely the best Chinese in the neighborhood. (It's currently listed as Asian Fusion - no way. This is straight-up American-style Chinese.)"}
