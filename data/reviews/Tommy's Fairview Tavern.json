{"text":"Super cheap micro brews here, and gourmet pizzas to boot!  Upon the pizza's arrival, we were disappointed to learn that the waitress had gotten our order wrong.  She did, however, promptly take the pizza off of our tab without being asked.  Moral of the story: you can't get every single order right, but you can make up for it with character.  The pizza was pretty awesome anyway..."}
{"text":"Don't judge the place by the outside.  You have probably driven by this strip mall tavern many times.  Stop next time! They have a great micro brew selection and the food is fantastic.  The perogies, wings, and stuffed banana peppers are outstanding appetizers. To top off the night, your bill will be less than what it would cost you to go to a big box type of resturant."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service or food here!  The burgers are excellent (as is the pizza).  Drinks are priced so well it's almost unbelievable!  The steaks (Saturday) are delicious, served with a huge potato and a very nice salad!

Wish it were bit less loud, I'd love to bring my parents!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My husband and I come here often and sat ourselves at a booth last Monday, after not being greeted upon walking in. We sat for at least 5 minutes still not greeted so my husband decided to grab a couple menus himself. We were then disappointed to find that the menu had changed. The typical fair view tavern menu is apparently no longer and now looks more mainstream. Some of the items that we loved ordering are now gone. Aside from that, we got tired of sitting without even a greeting from the waitress and got up to head to the bar. The waitress did appear a bit busy so we gave her that, but a simple greeting would have been nice. We decided to move to the bar only to sit for 5 more minutes without being greeted by one of the many bartenders as they were all chatting by the beer cooler. By then, we were tired of waiting and decided to take our money somewhere else as we were very hungry and did not want to wait any longer. Bottom line, we used to love this place and had only the highest thoughts of Fairview Tavern. I'm not sure what happened here, but we won't be returning again for a while. We haven't given up all hopes as we will give it another try eventually, and we are hoping that next time will bring better results."}
{"text":"Fariview Tavern is a hidden Gem. The atmosphere is pleasant and the service and food were just as fabulous. I noticed that the dining room portion was also full of families, and why not with $5 cheese pizzas on Mondays. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, making sure to check on us throughout our experience. She was even quick to correct a undercooked potato that was served to my boyfriend with his bourbon pork chop (Delicious!).

They have great happy hour drink special and great food specials all week. We enjoyed some of their wings which were awesome juicy and meaty on the inside while crispy and well sauced on the outside. 

All in all a really great place. Its the perfect place for a casual evening, hiding among a plaza full of shops. I highly recommend their 40cent wing special on Sunday and Monday Nights!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and the food is great. The steak special is great and cheap! Great place, nice and spacious bar, good table seating, usually a good live band. It's kind of small so get there early."}
{"text":"First time at Fairview Tavern was this past weekend. In the past I've gone to Stamper's across the street - but my brother-in-law suggested we do the \"Tavern.\" The sign out front only says \"Tavern\" by the way, so don't be confused. 

I was unsure what to expect at first, but the bar was really really nice. Staff was very courteous and eager to please. Knew the menu very well. Since Saturday I think I have already told another 5 people about how good my wings were. Our waitress recommended the Thai Sweet Chili wings to me. Oh my goodness. They were heaven. There were a ton of them too. I must have had about 8 - 9 wings for $8.50, which was great I thought because they were good sized wings. Nice selection of brews on tap. 

Back of the house could use a little work - e.g. bathroom could be cleaned up a little bit and the whole tabled seating area is a bit dated. Can't wait to come back and have some more of those little slices of heaven - some Thai Sweet Chili wings......."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere. Been coming here for years. Only gripe is that it's 55Â° outside and the a/c and fans are full-tilt. #freezing."}
{"text":"I fluctuate between 2.5 and 3 stars with this place.  You are surprised, I know because I frequent Tommy's often.  Here's the deal.

1. I go to Tommy's often because they're close to the church I sing at.
2. They have beer.
3. They have food.
4. They have great breakfast for those early service Sundays.  Cheap and tasty.

Here's what I don't like.

Service is slow.  No matter when you come or who is serving or where you sit, service is just slow.  Food is hit or miss.  Tuesdays can get you a burger and a beer for $6 and you can't go wrong with that!  The burger is good and so is the beer.  Tommy's has lousy French Fries.  

On Sunday a couple of weeks ago, my beau and I sat at the bar.  While waiting for a bartender to tend the bar, I attempted to go use the restroom (I couldn't because there was not TP.  Some of the first customers on a Sunday and no TP in the bathroom?  Come on!) upon my return moments later, I asked if my beau had been greeted yet.  He said no.  We waited a few more moments and the non-regular bartender walked up and past us.  No hi, how ya doin', I'll be right with you..nada!  We left.  

What I do like is Jackie, the usual bar tender.  She's great  I like the large serving mimosas on Sunday and the not-half-bad bloody Mary's on Sunday.  I love the fact that breakfast on Sunday is $5 for most meals.  And generally, I can get a Fat Tire or a Guinness of draft.  Also, they do a good Irish Car Bomb.

That being said.  Go to Tommy's if your not in a hurry and don't have high expectations.  You'll be not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza, decent wings. Attentive bartenders and cheap drinks. The back of the place and bathrooms are pretty gross and after witnessing a couple fights, I'm good on going back. Plus it's super dark inside 24/7, turn some lights on!!"}
{"text":"This tavern is very nice & has great food. They give you a good portion of food to eat. You will not go our of there hungry. We ordered the rosemary & garlic fries as an appetizer. What a huge portion of fries that we got. Then I ordered a house salad which had just about everything but the kitchen sink in that salad. It was huge also & must have weighed at least a pound or more. They are not expensive either. We had a couple of friends with us & we did not spend over $50.00 for drinks, beers & take out of wings. It is in a very nice area also that you can go shopping afterwards if you would like. They have grocery stores, & other stores that you could shop in while in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really good! Price is reasonable. Service is great!
They have a large menu and your food comes hot and quickly.  Not great for kids once live entertainment starts. May be too loud."}
{"text":"This place is tricky. The bar food is 5 stars hands down, but the atmosphere is not good for FP. 

There was a bouncer, on a Sunday night. In Fairview Park. Huh? I asked the waiter what the deal was and they said there had been some fights there lately. And also it wasn't your cool friendly bouncer type either. It was a kind of a dickish buff kid acting like dickish bouncers do. 

It's in a strip mall where I grocery shop, tan, use to work out, get my nails done, bowl, order Chinese and get the best sub sandwiches ever (Jersey Mike's), so where does this fighting element of FP come from? Ive been to Stampers across the street and the only fighting I've ever seen there is who is going to pick up the check.

I'll probably go back for the food, but it will be in the daylight and I'll sit by the door for a quick get away."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here on a week night once before service and food were good. Loved the homemade French onion chip dip , however we went on Friday night and he had the \"fish fry special\" he asked if the fish was heavily coated and was told no. When the dish came out it was clearly baked or broiled fish no batter involved. He stopped  the waitress and explained that this was not what he wanted. She then went on describing each item that came with the dinner. We could clearly see what was on the plate our issue was with the fish. She then Obnoxiously yelled for the manager. The manager handled the issue in tip top mgr style, however the waitress would not let it go. My husband explained he was not trying to be a pain but she continued to argue that it was what he ordered and that he yelled at her (didn't happen)  She was getting other customers involved as to why she was right and my husband was wrong while we were sitting right there. Needless to say it was now uncomfortable for us so I got a box to go    The night was not a total wash out as we went to Bonnie's down the street!"}
{"text":"Great bar, food is always well prepared, the specials are a great value, Tues is a burger and a pint for $5.00, and it's a real burger not a frozen patty. Sunday is pizza and wing day, and you can't go wrong with it. Place is small and always busy."}
{"text":"Trivia tuesday is a really good deal. $5 for a burger, chips and a beer. The burgers are super good, and the sauce that comes with the chips gives it a different touch. Trivia is a lot of fun and they're always very attentive. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here often mostly on Sunday or Monday..5 dollar pizza and 30 cent wings which both are delicious. 2 dollar drinks and friendly fast staff..can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great tavern. Wonderful drink specials and a friendly staff. The food is excellent for a small bar in a strip mall. You must try the thai chili wings! They are the best around. Also Sunday they serve $5 pizza's and 30 cent wings till 2a.m. The rest of the menu is unavailable after midnight. They change the menu several times a year and are always coming up with new good food.

 Sunday is karaoke night so if you like to sing or watch people make fools of themselves stop on in! They also have live music sometimes."}
{"text":"Caught the first half of the Sugar Bowl last night here.  Very neat little hole in the wall bar.  Tuesday Nights is a burger and pint of beer for $5.00.  I'm not joking that this burger was great.  It comes with homemade chips and this damn good french onion dipping sauce.  Happy Hour lasts till 9pm everyday.  Good crowd and friendly staff.  Waitress recommended the Thai Sweet wings and they were equally great.  Everyone in our group was very happy with their food and price."}
{"text":"Make sure you're drinking what you ordered, the owner ok's the practice of pouring well liquor into top shelf bottles! That goes for the blue turtle and the corvette lounge also.  The corvette lounge used to have good beer prices, but you walk across the street and get cheaper beers and better service. Would not recommend any of their bars!"}
{"text":"Went here for the last Fish Fry of Lent. Waited about 15 minutes. Extremely busy but for good reason. Great food, affordable, and fast! Small location for a busy bar, but I don't mind. 

The shrimp and perch were wonderful! Very satisfied overall!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Fairview Park. My husband and I are never disappointed when we go. The prices and nightly specials are terrific! 5 dollar burger and beer night on Tuesdays along with trivia is a great week night out! The menu is great and pretty large for a small tavern. The dip they serve with their chips is outstanding! The only downfall is the place is usually busy and with a small dining room inside, it makes it a long wait for a table at times. The don't have a patio either, which is always great in the summer months."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Tavern!  And good people running the place, a destination  for sure!

Do seem to change the menu quite often but always something good and they put love into the food.  Great drink prices and food specials are unbeatable.  I've had the steak special multiple times and it is ALWAYS solid.

Kid friendly and a great place to fill up!"}
{"text":"Went last night to meet friends who swear by the Saturday Special, a $10 steak dinner which includes baked potato and salad. When I got there I was a little worried...location is in a strip mall of stores and it definitely looks like a dark bar and the seating is cramped. The women's restroom was less than clean. Despite the lack of any atmosphere, the staff was friendly and food was a good surprise. We shared wings to start and they were big, crispy and accompanied by a nice chunky blue cheese. Nicely priced at 8.5. 3 of the 4 ordered the steak dinner and no complaints. Cooked as requested. The pizza was pretty mediocre, but completely edible. A bit of a hidden tavern food gem. But with lots of competition that can also deliver better atmosphere , seating or even a patio,  it will be hard to return, especially when the Temps are above freezing, I wouldn't want to go somewhere dark and dreary."}
{"text":"This is a good place, and the food is decent. I was ambivalent about writing this review just because my opinion probably won't matter much -- the crowd doesn't seem much like Yelp users, nor are their deep affections for the place likely to be swayed by my \"A-OK\" review. The good: The beer list is fairly extensive, the service is really fast and nice, food is almost absurdly plentiful, and there are some nice healthier options on the menu. It's not amazing food, but it's easy to see why so many regulars were jammed in there when I went. It's a nice place to have around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I really enjoy picking up lunch or dinner here I work right next door it's really good food. It surely is not your typical bar food I crave that Garlic Parmesan sauce I can put it on anything. The young ladies are very hospitable haven't ran into a bad attitude in the few months that I've been eating here"}
{"text":"Wow. Wasn't expecting anything too special when we decided to hop across the street from our usual Stamper's to give this place a try. Very glad we did. 

Sean ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the meat lover's calzone just sounded too good to pass up so I got that. 

Woah nellie was this a TON of food!!! We honestly could have split either plate and both been stuffed. 

1. Calzone - great crust, yummy filler and again, just ENORMOUS. Very good.

2. Pulled pork - very very good as well. First of all, the plate comes out and has not one but TWO sandwiches as well as a huge amount of fresh made chips. I thought maybe this was a mistake so I ask the server 'is it always like this?' He said yes. So I guess you just get two people's worth of food at Tommy's for the price of one. 

The sandwich(es) themselves were awesome. Usually I steer clear of pretzel buns because I find them oversized and usually kind of hard. But these were perfect. Soft, tender, warm and yummy. Went with the pulled pork and coleslaw filler perfectly. 

I spied some of the pizzas they were bringing out and was drooling over them even as I was chowing my own calzone. I think I read that they have a pizza special night too one night a week so you can get a crazy cheap pizza. Trust me, we'll be back to try this. You should too. A great little find in Fairview."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I have learned that Fairview Tavern has had 12 CRITICAL health code violations since MAY of this year!  There were numerous non-critical violations as well.  I won't be returning.  I won't risk getting sick.  This is unacceptable and I can't believe they haven't been shut down yet."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at how quickly a rating can change. 

5 of us stopped in recently to check out the band and get some food. I had been looking forward to this all week- I'm not kidding. There are always so many things on the menu and I was looking forward to trying something new. They were nice and busy, so we waited about 20 minutes for a table. When I finally feasted my eyes upon the menu.... I was so bummed. The menu has changed drastically and none of the things I wanted to try were on it. In fact, there was literally nothing on the menu I wanted to consider for dinner. How does that happen? I'm certainly not that picky.

After grumbling a bit, I settled on a salad, lobster bisque soup (special) and pierogies. The salad, thankfully, hasn't changed. It's still pretty and their house dressing is delicious. The pierogi were smothered in too many red onions, but once I slid those off... there were pillowy, full and delicious pierogies underneath. The lobster bisque soup was disappointing. It had no lobster chunks at all and tasted like canned soup. I couldn't even finish it. 

Our service was okay, but I felt like we were ignored because they knew we were staying to hear the band. I started off with a beer, but the service was too slow to keep it going so I switched to soda.

I know they have the same cook, so I'm not sure why all the changes but I hope they'll update their menu and give me something to come back to!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! Their pizza and philly rolls are great!!! Service was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"Update to a previous poor review: this place really fixed all their issues.  They need more variety of beer but the food quality and price make up for that. Go here instead of Stampers across the street."}
