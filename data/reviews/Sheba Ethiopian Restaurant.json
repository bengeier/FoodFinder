{"text":"I love Ethiopian food. The service here was very good, the restaurant was clean and I thought the ambience was good as well. Definitely a fun place for a group of friends or a date night. Shared several meat and veggie dishes with a friend and wasn't terribly impressed by the flavor. To be honest, it rather lacked flavor altogether and there was surprisingly little spice. I wouldn't rush back for myself or with friends who are into ethiopian, but if I had friends who i wanted to introduce to the ethiopian dining experience who might be a bit hesitant of spice, I would consider Sheba."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian in the city. Hands down.  I try to come here at least once a month, and more often in the summer when the front patio is open. The family that owns it is incredibly nice, and after just a few visits started treating us like regulars.   The food is just miles beyond the other Ethiopian places in the city, and i've tried almost every other one... I don't know what they do differently, but both their Meat Platter and Veggie Platter are out of this world. Sharing those two dishes between 2 people is WAY MORE than enough food, and comes to about $30.   Especially love the African art all over the place.  Awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is a bit slow but I kind of like it honestly since it allows for more time to talk and to go to the washroom and stuff. It is a bit dim and dirty looking but I guess I don't really mind the grungy look. The servers are friendly, the food comes in great portions and is really hearty. They also give you more bread rolls if you ask for it but usually it comes with so many I can barely walk out the door after anyways. Very much recommended."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Vegetarian food is underrated. Order the coffee in the middle of a meal. Great experience"}
{"text":"My first experience with Ethiopian food was at Sheba. This restaurant has a very Ethiopian feel to it. They have ethnic paintings, nice decorations and frankincense burning in the restaurant.   The staff is super friendly, but I found the service to be slow even though very few tables in the restaurant were occupied. Prices were reasonable, and the food was good and spicy; the injera bread served with the dish was interesting- a sourdough type taste with a moist spongy and stretchy crepe bread texture. Also, you don't have any eating utensils since Ethiopian food is consumed while using your hands, like Indian food.   I always like to have dessert after my meal, this place has no desserts! So I got their spiced tea instead, which was nice.   The major downfall about my experience was that I lost my appetite a little after noticing that some of their tables were stained with food from previous customers, it really grossed me out-sorry.   Overall, I had an okay experience."}
{"text":"I've been attending this place for years, and I'm always taken back by their food, their accommodating ways, and just how well they take care of their customer base. This is my no. 1 spot to dine Ethiopian. No other place downtown compares to Sheba."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice ambiance and would make a great date spot. The food was good, not the most spectacular tibs I've ever had but definitely good and its great that they give you lots of extra injera on the side."}
{"text":"We (a party of four) arrived for dinner at about 7:30 on a Sunday night. The server (there was only one) was a bit slow to arrive at our table, but was very friendly and helpful in taking our order.   Unfortunately, it then took more than an hour for our food to arrive. I had to ask our server at the hour point if our food was on its way; she said there had been a small mistake in the kitchen and it was coming, apologizing profusely. When the food finally did come, some came about 10 minutes sooner than others, and it wasn't all hot.  The quality of the food... rather uneven, unfortunately. Some dishes were over-salted, and others under-salted. Some of it was truly delicious, however. We were so hungry we ate most everything anyway, but it really left something to be desired.  Our server was very apologetic, and seemed genuinely upset at how the evening was going. I felt very bad for her, as it seemed to be a mistake in the kitchen, and not her own fault; she had been pretty diligent the whole evening in serving the entire dining room (there were up to 15 people there at the busiest while I was there). As a former server, I really felt for the waitress, and we all tipped decently. My feeling is the management understaffed, and something for sure was going on in the kitchen. There's slow service, and then there's this. For a quiet Sunday evening, you shouldn't have to wait an hour+ for food.  I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good atmosphere but the service can be slow sometimes. Sometimes it's normal but I have had to wait up to an hour before. Food is well worth it but don't come here if you're short on time unless you like to chase streetcars.  Take-out is unusually hardy. On the aforementioned occasion that I had to wait an hour for my food and then order it for take-out because I was about to miss a meeting, I was able to walk with the food for over half an hour in the cold and my mama shiro was still very hot. They give you a lot of injera, but if it's not enough for you, extra is free!"}
{"text":"I eat here every couple of weeks so the love is clear. Inexpensive and so, so delicious this is my favorite casual spot in the area. I've brought friends, fam and clients and it's a hit across the board. My favorites are the lega tibs and the shiro, but you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"YUM!   After stoping by the Ethiopian Spice Store in Kensington, I was craving some Ethiopian food! The owner recommended Sheba as a close and yummy option, and I had a great experience here. I enjoyed the tibs, kifto (they default serve it cooked, so make sure you ask for it raw if that's how you want it) and mama shiro (veggie dish) along with a salad.   Loved the food, it really hit the spot. The service was super friendly and courteous! While I've only been to a handful of Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto, my half-Ethiopian eating-partner confirmed that this was really great food.  No Ethiopian beers to enjoy on their small patio, but they have a nice open space by the front with lots of natural sunlight - a great place to enjoy a spiced tea in the summer time.   Not sure if they changed the menu since one commenter before went, but all of the prices were clearly laid out when I was there last week. For 2 meat, 1 veggie, 1 salad, 1 beer and 1 macciato for 2 (HUNGRY) people it was about $65 tax and tip in - could have easily fed 3 regular people. Great spices and can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"We got take out from this place (via Just Eat) and they forgot one (of only two) main dishes. We called to complain and I overheard the lady who answered talking to the manager in the background, to say they were disinterested is probably given them more credit than is due.  Further to that the quality was terrible and they loaded it up with bread and little else. To make matters worse, for Ethiopian it was expensive. My fiance is from Sudan and we eat East African food multiple times a week. So we know good shit. I think many people who aren't knowledgeable about such cuisine get caught up in the novelty of it all to realize the portions, quality and service at this place is utter crap.  If I could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"We ended up going here because there was too long a line at Aunties and Uncles. My husband had talked about going to an Ethiopian restaurant a few days ago and Sheba was right there.  I think we were the first customers of the day since it was pretty empty and dark. The ambiance was not that great, the place looks a little run down and dingy.   We started out with the Enjera Salad which was superb! It was a burst of flavours! For our main course we had the vegetable combo with lamb. I don't remember the name of the lamb dish but it had enjra soaked in the gravy. The vegetables were ok, not that great and the lamb was very average. I have been to many Ethiopian restaurants and the food here is not bad, but its just not the best I've had. Its ok if you want to give it a try (the salad was the best!) and maybe our choice of lamb wasn't the best. I think had we tried individual dishes instead of the combo it might have been a different experience.  I would have loved to try their special coffee but unfortunately for just two people it seemed very expensive. The service however was wonderful."}
{"text":"Nice food but poor service. We had to ask for water several times. Apparently the server was quite busy with her cell."}
{"text":"Definitely not my first Ethiopean, but I took my Mom here for her first experience.  I do wish they served food in baskets as we all sat around them. But, a glass-top table and a plate works OK.   Of course the food arrives and Mom asks, \"Where is the silverware?\"   I forget people don't know the protocol. So much food my mom and I shared a plate and still couldn't finish all of it. Veggie plate- mouth watering. Ask for hot sauce on the side, if you like it hot."}
{"text":"Sheba is my 1st experience with Ethiopian food. I was so impressed with the food that I took another friend within a week.  I'm obviously not a pro in ordering Ethiopian food since I've only tried it twice and both times at Sheba. Both times I shared the veggie platter and meat platter with whoever I was with. And I know, I won't be able to tell you which veggie and meat options we chose for the platters... but I can tell you this much. The food was impressive enough for me to go to back to Sheba a few days after my initial visit.  Oh... and I WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends who has never tried Ethiopian food before last night for dinner.   For me the food itself its pretty much the same as any other it had vegeterian dishes and meat dishes. The servers were great and very helpful and even prepared a special platter just for us which had all the veggies and meat dishes. My friends enjoyed it as well and were all thinking of going back.  We finished the meal with Ethiopian coffee which was great also very strong in flavor and scent.  Food - 4/5 Recommdations - Mix platter, Kikil"}
{"text":"I went to Sheba with 2 friends who wanted to go to another place that we know and love. I said no, let's try Sheba. My friends are holding a grudge against me now and frankly, I don't blame them.   The atmosphere was nice-nice art, nice smell...  the waitress blatantly lied to us about the price (no prices on the menu)  ONE meal to share with 3 scoops of curry and 2 SMALL scoops of meat cost $65. I asked before ordering, and she said it's not charged per person but you get 3 veggies for $12 and then a meat. Turned out she \"misunderstood\" me and really it was charged about $12 per scoop.   Awful experience. The meat was bad, the veggie curry was quite good, though....but never again would I go there.  I love Ethiopian but am by no means snooty about it. But I know when I've been scammed and were scammed big time.   Recommendation: go to the many Ethiopian places on Bloor near Ossington, instead!"}
{"text":"mmm not super excited with the food. somehow I feel that the food size/variety and prices don't go along very well. a tiny injera with one veg or meat side is about $10-$13  combo plate with multiple sides cost $13 and higher.  but I think other ethiopian places actually provide multiple sides on one injera for the price of one side and injera at Sheba. the split peas that I oredered were just ok the service was friendly a bit slow but we enjoyed the time that was given to us chatting  not my first ethiopian choice in TO"}
{"text":"Pretty small place at the Bathurst and College area, with a few lovely outdoor patio seating. The service was quick and consistent and the server often checked up on us and gave us suggestions on the menu. We had the vegetarian platter and everything about it was amazing. Great to get your hands on the injera and it was lovely with the spiced veggies. Prices were decent for the portion.   Would def come back again!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about Ethiopian food so I decided to give it a try! This was my first experience so I wasn't sure what to order. I went with what other reviewers had liked  Here's what I had: 1.  Doro Wot: 7/10. This was ok. It wasn't my ideal lunch dish but it may be because I was not used to the doughiness of the bread. The sauce and chicken were pretty good though. 2.  Alicha Wrap: I did not like this at all. The bread already has no taste but neither did the filling. If it had some sort of sauce I think I would have liked it more"}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food and Sheba never disappoints. Sheba is a no frills, no gimmicks kind of place - relaxed, casual and always consistent. I recommend trying out one of the combos, as it allows diners to try a variety of delicious dishes served with injera. Sheba is great for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike as well (another bonus!).  As others have pointed out, Sheba is not always the fastest service, but if you are not in a rush, it is well worth the wait. The service is always friendly and the price points are excellent.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at five different Ethiopian restaurants in my life, one in Africa and four in North America.  Sheba is the best I've had in North America, and I've been to some good places here too.  I think the best part of Sheba is the atmosphere.  The dining room is spacious, comfortable, and nice, but not fancy.  The prices were great, and the service was good too.  The food, most importantly, is great too.  The vegetable dishes particularly are deeeelish.  Some Ethiopian places to which I've been are small cramped places that make up for their shortcomings with delicious food.  This place is delicious without any of the usual shortcomings I've experienced at Ethiopian places, especially in Toronto.  Good place for first-timers as well!"}
{"text":"Cosy joint located on College. For those of you who've never had Ethiopian be prepared. There is no cutlery and use injera (a type of slightly sour flatbread) to dip into various dishes. We ordered the veggie combo plate which provides 6 different vegetarian dishes and ordered the Doro Wot (chicken based stew - on the left of the picture provided). The serving was more than enough for 2 people. We also ordered a bottle of house wine which was only $24 (what a steal).   The waitress was kind and offered recommendations based on what items were popular. The service was a little slow but the wine helped us overcome how long it took for the food to come. If you're in the neighbourhood and looking for an experience I'd tell you this is your spot. Plus if all else fails, you can't go wrong with $24 for a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"For the inexperienced, Sheba is a great introduction to Ethiopian cuisine. The menu had all the classic options, helpful English descriptions, and a welcoming atmosphere. However, if you judge an ethnic restaurant by the number of \"natives\" eating there; Sheba was the first Ethiopian restaurant I've been to without any Ethiopians in sight. Also, the Shiro was a little bland and it was dissapointing they didn't have any Tej (honey wine) or Ethiopian beers on the menu. Still, the food was good, the prices reasonable, and it proved to be a great eating experience. We would eat here again. Ahmeseganalo (thank you) !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! The food takes a while, but it's worth the wait. I had the vegetarian platter and my husband the lamb dish that is made with various spices. I haven't tried any other Ethiopian restaurant, but I can tell you that they know how to mix their spices."}
{"text":"I came with a large group and they placed all our food onto 2 platters instead of giving each person a separate plate, since the table wouldn't be large enough for that. The environment is very dimly lit and the restaurant itself is on the quieter end. Service was excellent and all the staff was extremely helpful with explaining the menu. You do eat with your hands and it's a sharing environment, so don't expect any individual plates or cutlery. Food was very tasty and it's a great place to try out traditional Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5. It was good but not great. Their injera lacked the subtle sour taste I enjoy and all their lentil dishes weren't saucy enough for me. I enjoy having a lot of sauce for my injera to mop up but this one I had a lot of dry injera left over. The restaurant is also kind of dark and not inviting. What was great about this place however is that their lentils were cooked perfectly (especially the yellow lentils which is hard to cook without it becoming a mush)."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty, but the portions are quite small for the price. I went to Lalibela for instance, and received double the amount of food for the same bill, same quality, and better ambience. It's nice when you don't have to be careful about how much you're eating when the plates are made to share-- which I found myself doing here. On top of that, my food arrived quite cold, even when the restaurant wasn't very full. I won't be returning for these reasons."}
{"text":"Excellent Ethiopian restaurant.  I am quite loyal to Bloor west when it comes to satisfying a craving for Ethiopian food but I decided to head south and give Sheba Ethoipian a shot with some friends for dinner last night.  I walked away stuffed as usual but what stood out was their delicious chicken and beef items.  The flavour was heavenly, well spiced and stewed.  Melted in your mouth.  I wish I could describe what was in the chicken and beef but I have no idea, except that it was amazing. Sheba is not a cheap as the outposts on Bloor but certainly worth it as it makes up in atmosphere and friendliness of the staff."}
{"text":"Hot, tasty food served with a smile. Great stop on a ramble across this buzzing part of downtown. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good here. We were four on a Monday evening and it was an excellent meal.  It is a small place and the service was efficient and personal. We had: - The spiced tea: hot water with cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and tea. It was nice and uplifting.  - The mama roll appetizer (I think I got this right): This was very average. I would skip it.  - The kik alecha and the doro wot were excellent. The doro wot was spicy and fragrant.  Overall, a very enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"I was quiet disappointed with my experience at Sheba. The food was mediocre (compared to other Ethiopian restaurants) and the service was indifferent (even though the restaurant was empty).  My wife and I love Ethiopian food and have been regular visitors to the local places in the cities where we lived (Chicago, New York and Cleveland). This was in the bottom quartile.   The prices were definitely not cheap (even by New York standards)."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced, and huge portions.   Sheba was my first Ethiopian experience about 3 or 4 years ago. Since the, I've tried a lot of the other places on Bloor, Parkdale and one just off Yonge st. I've never been disappointed by any Ethiopian place, but I keep going back to Sheba for a number of reasons:  - Their food is the best, hands down. While the others are good, Sheba is the BEST. It's not too spicy, but it has tons of flavour.  - Friendly staff - always willing to accommodate my request for separate injera platters when I don't feel like sharing in the huge platter.   - Large portions - easy to share a lot of things if that's your thing..  - Great vegetarian options (although this is true of any Ethiopian restaurant)  - Nice atmosphere - one reviewer described it as ethnic, I would say cozy and warm instead.   - Coffee ceremony is fun and a perfect end to dinner, especially with a date. Popcorn goes surprisingly well with coffee :)  They are more expensive than some of the places on Bloor, but in this case you get what you pay for. $2-3 more per platter is fine when the quality worth twice that.   I noticed that other reviewers thought it was slow, which it can be, but when you factor in waiting in line at a place like Nazareth, which is also slow to get food out, it's actually much quicker than other places. I think Ethiopian food takes a bit longer to make.   I fully recommend this place. I've taken friends and family there, and it quickly becomes their new staple restaurant."}
{"text":"dim restaurant carrying a pervasive scent of spices.  inviting!  i shared the 1 meat 3 vegetable platter, which is priced very fairly at about $16.  we chose the kitfo for our meat, a dish of finely minced raw beef with generous seasoning -- black pepper dominates, but there are some other spices in here as well that i can't discern.  the meat is sliced small enough so that you don't have to chew through chunks of it.  a wonderful dish.  for the vegetables, we ordered: collard greens, simple with a good leafy texture; lentils, quite spicy and very tasty; and chick peas, flavourful and slightly spicy.  the injera here is sour as usual, fluffy in texture, and absolutely delicious.  i highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Friday night for dinner, and honestly I would not want to go back again. The food itself was delicious that's why I'm still giving it three stars, but everything else wasn't the greatest. The waitress took forever to take our order, and looked like she had no idea what she was doing. The food took more than 40 minutes to arrive and at that point we were ready to leave and go somewhere else. If anything I would not go on a weekend night again. The food portion was okay, however would not recommend for meat lovers as the meat items were pretty small in size. Overall not really a great experience first time dining here. I don't think it's a bad place if you want to try Ethiopian food and it's close to you, but personally speaking there are other Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto, I would rather try those next time."}
{"text":"Had a delicious and fun dinner here last night. The space was nicely lit (not too dim, not too bright) and on the quieter side, except for our group. We were a table of eight rambunctious people, and our server was surprisingly not annoyed by us (I would be lol)... She was really friendly and fun, cracking jokes and helping us navigate the menu.  I ordered a spiced tea, which was really nicely flavoured and was great to sip alongside the meal. Food took a while, which is fair and kind of expected since there were eight of us. I ordered the meat and veggie combo with kitfo (raw spiced beef), two types of lentils, and collard greens served on top of injera. They give you lots of options with which to customize the meat and veggie combo. The serving was pretty generous. I wasn't a huge fan of the collard greens, but everything else was delicious. For about $25 including tax and tip, I had a very satiating and delicious meal. I will be back!"}
{"text":"As far as food goes, I thought this was one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to in Toronto. For comparison, I've been to Ethiopian House, Addis Ababa, and Lalibela. I really enjoyed their Cha Cha Tibs  (lamb dish that comes on a sizzling platter) and while not normally a fan of Kitfo (their raw dish), I actually liked it here. However, I didn't really like their Awaze Tibs - way too dry!  I also liked that their Injera comes separately and I didn't have to tear it away from the bottom after it's been soaked through with the sauce. Another bonus - they had Ethiopian honey wine, which was nice to try.  BUT...  The reason this only got 3 stars is the service. It was S-L-O-W. I came on a Saturday night and they had a big group of about 10 to serve so that may explain why it was slow so it may be better on another night. We waited half an hour for them to bring us our coffee service that we ordered at the beginning of the meal, but they never did, so we finally gave up and left.  So it's definitely worth trying if you like Ethiopian food, but just beware of the slow service!"}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food; if this had been my first experience I probably would never have tried the cuisine again.  The food was just bland. We ordered a vegetarian combo, and a meat combo (which had raw kitfo and tibs). Really the only thing that was flavorful was one lentil and the kitfo. On top of that it took forever for our food to come out and almost as long to get our bill. I wanted to like this place because it was convenient, but I just don't. It was probably the most disappointing Ethiopian meal I've ever had (which we agreed still makes it better then mediocre pizza). It wasn't wildly expensive, but it wasn't cheap. Will be walking further next time."}
{"text":"Small restaurant along College Street, just across from Kensington Market.   Tried the single vegetarian platter ($15) which was well-proportioned, but I don't like how the brown lentils are whole. I prefer mushier Ethiopian food. Otherwise, still pretty solid, with good injera.   Like most typical Ethiopian restaurants, service is slow and mellow. Be patient.   Beware, there is no AC here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here very much. The service was great and the decor was nice. I ordered the beef tibs and they were great. The injera complimented the meat nicely. Service was prompt and attentive. Eating with your hands was a ton of fun! I would definitely come here again. Prices were fair. My dish was priced 13 dollars.The food took a while to arrive, but that was no problem because we were not in a hurry. Aside from that, everything was great! I didn't mind waiting because the food and service was exemplary and that is what counts!"}
{"text":"I was really hungry when I visited here so that likely influenced my review. I haven't gone for Ethiopian for a while as my last experience elsewhere wasn't good. We ordered the vegetarian platter and it was fantastic. I really over ate. The spicy lentil was my favorite but I have to say it was all tasty. Staff is very friendly and the price point is great. My whole family could have eaten dinner in just the platter."}
{"text":"We went to the Sheba Ethiopian Restaurant on a Saturday night and we had a great time there. Food is really good and service fast! We recommend that place for a traditional Ethipian meal!"}
{"text":"perfect place to experience ethiopian food. great quality. regular (20/person) prices. very nice staff.  just a small effort to make on the local setting (tables, chairs, comfort) and it would a fine place (yes they have typical painting hanging on the walls, but the place is not warmth, nor cosy...)"}
{"text":"Ethiopian food is some of the more unique food I've had.  You get spongy flat bread that you use for scooping a variety of saucy dishes.  The flavours are a bit of an acquired taste.  The meat may be tough, and is not a highlight.  Stick with the vegetarian dishes.  Make sure that you pre-order the coffee before the end of the meal.  It's a whole ceremony.  They roast the beans in a pan and then bring the pan to your table for you to take a whiff.  Then the coffee is served with popcorn (!) and frankincense.  It's a symphony of smoke. The Bedouins say that coffee should be strong like a man, dark as the night, and bitter as married life. The coffee here fits the bill."}
{"text":"Very good. Waitress helped my group of 7 people order some of the best Ethiopian dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"I went here twice last weekend and loved it! It's great for an outing with family and close friends, or for a date night. The food and service were excellent, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had never tried Ethiopian food before coming to Sheba, but this was the location of my conversion. It is SO good. It reminds me of Indian food except with delicious injera (that awesome crumpet-style sourdough flatbread) instead of naan. Mmmmm....  Anyway Sheba is a great place to lose your Ethiopian food virginity. It's usually not too busy, the interior is really cozy and cute, and the staff are so attentive and nice!   The restaurant is owned by two sisters who are really sweet and helpful (apparently they own that Bakery on the Go in Bathurst station that always smells like freshly baked bread). They're understanding if you have no idea what to order -- our first time here we got a sampler platter of a couple different dishes, it was the special of the day and it meant we got to try a bunch of things instead of sticking to one. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who has never tried Ethiopian or who just isn't sure what to get.  Sheba has lots of vegetarian and meat-eater options, and they provide you with tons of injera to scoop up all the savoury spices and curry-style dishes. They also have forks in case you get tired of using your hands (or if they're really dirty).  I definitely recommend getting the Ethiopian coffee on a trip here -- last time my boyfriend got it and I was jealous I didn't have one for myself. No idea what's in it exactly, but it tasted like heaven so get some to have the true Ethiopian experience.  And apparently this place has a breakfast buffet from 8:30am-11:30 am daily...haven't tried Ethiopian for breakfast but I can't see my stomach telling me that's a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Although not the best Ethiopian in the city it is a local place and on a cold day is close to home. The place is long and narrow with a small window that looks out on the traffic of College street. This window hosts two ratty, although comfortable chairs for having coffee. The rest of the tables run along both walls leading to a raised floor that hosts the serving counter and a small kitchen. The place is decorated with a small selection of Ethiopian-inspired paintings and curios hanging on the walls. The tables and chairs are simple and straight-forward and dressed with table cloths. We opted for the vegetarian platter for two, which consists of a giant injara covered platter with a selection of the vegetarian pulses in small piles. The plate comes with a small basket of more injara for soaking everything up. There are always some parts that are better than others, but the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is fine, but I think the food could be a lot more flavourful. It does seem healthier than most Ethiopian I eat (maybe less oil used?), but certainly not among the city's best. Also, the service can be painfully slow even when you're the only customer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Sheba earlier this year and whatever I got was just typical Ethiopian, but you simply must go for the coffee.  Typically in coffee shops you have a choice of countries and Ethiopia is always represented, so why not go directly to the source (in terms of Toronto)? Sheba offers an amazing coffee ceremony (yes, ceremony!) that takes a while but is sooooooooo worth it.  It's served with popcorn which is bizarre but, hey, you are going for the experience!  PS Get the injera, it is delish."}
{"text":"First shot at Ethiopian. What a great experience!!   We tried the meat and veggie platter. It was delicious... The coffee was a delight!! Make sure you order ahead of time. They roast the beans right in front of you.... Hmmm!  This place isn't fancy, but you'll find it comfortable and fun!!"}
