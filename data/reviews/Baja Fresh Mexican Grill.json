{"text":"I have mixed feelings on Baja Fresh in general. Sometimes I love it to death, other times I'm like, \"I just payed $11 for a chicken quesadilla and a drink?\""}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. This is my second time visiting and the second time my order was messed up. I had ordered a chicken ceaser salad burrito. It was my mistake I guess, from what I remember a ceaser salad doesn't have tomatoes in it. Well it does here. I don't like tomatoes. Love ketchup but not regular tomatoes soggin up my meal. I had them make another burrito. The menu clearly states what's in a ceaser salad, and tomato is not one of the ingredients. The replacement burrito tastes slightly better than the first but not by much. Maybe they had a surplus of tomatoes and were trying to get rid of em I don't know. Should've went to Costa Vida but as we all know they are almost always crowded. Ugh F me and my burrito cravings."}
{"text":"I'm only writing this review as a favor for budget eaters looking for a somewhat healthy solution.  I think this place has one of the best deals for two things:  the fish taco (about $2), and the veggie burrito (about $4).   This is my place when I'm rushed, starving, and don't want to give in to garbage.  The real bonus is the tremendous amount of pico de gallo, jalps, and salsa you can load up on for free."}
{"text":"Still love this place!

Jorge, the manager, is so nice.  I come here so much, he knows me as soon as I walk in and can even take a guess as to what I'll order (I'm predictable).  Amazing manager, and super friendly staff.  I love the food here.  I never feel sick after I eat here, just full, satisfied, and nourished.

...and I'm the duchess, with so many check-ins, no one has a chance of dethroning me.  lol"}
{"text":"Disappointed that they closed this Baja Fresh I love eating service here is awesome just too bad hope to have one on this side of town again"}
{"text":"Fresh food for a decent price. I got a build your own burrito and it was huge. It was packed with chicken, beans, cheese lettuce tomato. Great deal for the price. Would probably eat there again. Viva las Mexico"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Service is great... my salad was delicious.  There new surf and turf is great. The staff is always very nice to me is a great place to grab on the go and it fresh!"}
{"text":"Food great, service great, but the restaurant was filthy. Workers standing around talking while every table was dirty, floor and soda counter disgusting. I was there 45 minutes and no one made a move to clean anything."}
{"text":"Plenty has been said of late about the eating choices we make. It comes with little wonder. We are, after all, a very fat country. That is, so the experts contend, because we just cannot seem to get enough to eat from our cartoon-represented fast food chains. We eat the greasy burgers and fries, chicken sandwiches and the gravy-suffocated chicken bowls (Wait a minute. Does anybody really eat those?). There are better dining choices, to be sure. But I'm just not sure those smarter decisions can be made a Baja Fresh.

Consider first that Baja Fresh is or was a subsidiary of the Wendy's burger chain. While Wendy's is home to one of the best fast food chicken sandwiches out there, it is not by any means the Good Earth. It should come as no surprise then that a subsidiary packs a lot of calories into their food offerings as well.

Take a classic like the Bean & Cheese Burrito, for example. There are beans, cheese and a tortilla. How bad can it be? Try 980 calories worth of bad with 40 grams of fat. That doesn't even include chips. By comparison, a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese at McDonald's would plow 730 calories into your gut. The good news, I suppose, is that you hardly need to eat the rest of the day after eating a Baja Fresh burrito. In the end, just know that a trip to Baja Fresh --- while tasty --- is as much of a trip to Wendy's, McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Carl's Junior ..."}
{"text":"This place was okay one thing I did notice the food was not fresh and I think I should've just made a sandwich other than that customer service was good I think the company is cutting back on their freshness"}
{"text":"Just stopped by this location yesterday and it was completely empty!  Checked their website and the location here and the one one FLW isn't listed either.  The closest one to Scottsdale is at 7th Street and Bell.  Did a franchisee go under?"}
{"text":"Great place to go when I need a quick and healthy lunch.  I get the Baja salad w/ mahi on it. Healthy green lettuce.  Lots of fish. Dressing on the side.  I also enjoy the ahi tacos.  Great lunch deal."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Baja Fresh! We went to this one for the first time, and it was the cleanest BF I've ever been to. The service was also excellent, the girl was smiling when she brought our food to our table. Yes, I didn't have to go get it. =-) We were very happy.
The only thing I have to add though, is that we thought the salsa tasted much different than we were used to at other locations. Very different. The molcajete (sp?) tasted bland and not at all like what we were used to."}
{"text":"Service was great, Food was excellent...the down side was the tables were dirty! The place only had one table in use when we arrived!"}
{"text":"When reviewing a Baja or other franchise, typically the review is how it goes for that specific location.  This location of Baja Fresh is awful, whereas most other locations I have been to have been outstanding.

The wait times are absurd, the staff are rude, the place is dirty, and portion size compared to other Bajas is BS.  Yes, I am nitpicking on this (isn't that what Yelp is for?) but the amount of chips they give you while you wait here is terrible in comparison to other locations - and I came here 3 times to give it the benefit of the doubt over the past 6 months or so.  

If management here could get it together, I'd become a regular as I am in the area frequently.  Until that happens, paz!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that everything is really cooked fresh.  There really isn't any oil added.  The salads are great.  The bowls are great.  The service is good.  Staff isn't required to be friendly but you can't have everything."}
{"text":"fatty meat low quality with inflated prices. this place has went down substantially"}
{"text":"Driving up and down on Scottsdale Rd, I was looking for Panera but thought Baja Fresh looked intriguing.  It was early so I could find a place to park in the tiny lot they share with Starbucks.  I ordered a chicken caesar burrito and thought it was the best thing I've eaten in ages.  The wrap was filled with romaine, well-flavored chunks of flame grilled chicken, bits of avocado.  The salsa bar had several delicious options.  I might go back just to snack on tortillas and the different salsas.  I hope they open in Albuquerque New Mexico soon."}
{"text":"okay so I haven't yelped in a while and let me tell you I have a lot to yelp about!

My boyfriend and I went here on Sunday and got the worst service ever!!!! I actually called and complained about it to 2 different stores because when I called this Bell road store to complain they said there was no manager and the girl who answered was the girl I wanted to complain about so DUH I wasn't going to tell her my complaint so she could pass it on to no one so that is why I called the other locations which No one ever called me back soooo... we will never be going back here. 

So on Sunday we went here and yes they were a little busy. Our order was taken within a few minutes and then we proceeded to the salsa bar which either the person before us made a huge mess or the thing hadn't been cleaned in a while. My boyfriend and I ordered the EXACT same thing... chicken taco plate, flour tortillas, mild salsa, add onion. Simple right??? Okay so the taco plates comes with a small bag of chips.... I asked him if I could get a small side of guac for my tacos- he then asked \"do you want the 8oz size with chips\"... and I told him NO... my meal comes with chips I just want a small side. (which I have gotten before and I think it was like 1.50 or so.) So me not paying attention to the receipt didn't realize that yes indeed he did (even though he asked me and I said NO) charged me for the 8oz with chips. Now like I said I just wanted a little guac for my tacos. Which not to mention the guac isn't really all that great. The tacos are good, the service is bad. 

Sooooooooooooo anyways after we get our salsa we then sit down at a table to wait for our food. Pretty much every single open table was dirty too. Almost immediatly after sitting down a plate comes up in the window and is put under the heating lamp. About 5 minutes goes by and that same plate is still sitting up there. Okay so now the girl working puts that 5 min old plate in a bag and sets it there on the counter. And now about another 5 minutes goes by and a plate comes up in the window and she gets it and puts it in the bag with the old plate. And of course... my luck... it's our food! Okay now like I said before... we ordered the EXACT same thing! So now why did one come up in two minutes and the other take 10???  

So trying not to be rude but KNOWING that that 10 min old 5 minutes sitting in a bag food was going to be COLD.... I asked her \"why did the one come up so fast and the other take so long and they are the exact same thing... isn't that one going to be cold since it has been sitting in a bag for like 10 minutes\".... and she so rudely said \"I DONT KNOW\".... I don't know???? really????? are you kidding me... that was her answer. So I said again \"isn't that one going to be cold\"... I'm sorry but I don't go out to get cold food... and she said again even more rudely \"I DONT KNOW\". Uummmmmmmmmmm I think that should have been the point where she had them remake the food so it would be hot or something. 

Okay so then back to the guac.... So like I said I had realized that he had charged me for the 8oz when I only wanted the small side...  So I then mentioned to the RUDE girl that \"hey you guys charged me for the large side when I only wanted the small side\".... and she said \"WELL IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME\"... ??????? what really???? it's totally not the same. You guys are now charging me for chips when my meal comes with a small bag. yes it was a lot more chips then we usually get but the point is... We didn't want them! So then I mentioned to her that my meal comes with chips and that I didn't want to buy extra chips and then SHE TURNS AROUND... GRABS THE TWO SMALL BAGS OF CHIPS THAT THE MEAL COMES WITH, BASICALLY SMASHES THEM IN HER HAND WHILE SHOVING THEM AT ME, AND PRETTY MUCH SAYS... HERE'S YOUR CHIPS. 

Like I said... the tacos are good - BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME BACK AND BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE BY SOME GIRL. I am a paying customer that doesn't like to pay for cold food, be charged extra for something that I didn't order, call to talk to a manager and be told that there is no manager, call and complain to not one but TWO different locations and be told by TWO different locations that a manager will call me back and have TWO different locations NOT CALL ME BACK! 

WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me set this disclaimer:  I am not joking or exaggerating in the following statements.


Came into this location and it feels very run down.  Tiles are falling off the wall, Labels missing from the soda machine, dirty tables and trash cans and they have a portable air conditioning unit on the floor... With a hole cut in the side of the building for the exhaust.  I couldn't believe it, they went to Home Depot for Ac.  A major chain like Baja should have the resources to get their Ac fixed properly."}
{"text":"Ate there last night ...................

     **********BLAND**********TASTELESS*********OVERPRICED********** 

     Don't believe me.........They're waiting for you"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here for lunch a couple of weeks ago. I had a Baja burrito with rice and beans added. He had one of their bowls. While the burrito was delicious, I'm giving my experience 1 star because I got the absolute worst food poisoning. He also got sick later that day. Neither of us had anything to eat prior to this visit. This Baja Fresh looked kind of run down, and it took forever for someone to even help us at the counter or acknowledge our presence. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Parking situation was a bit tight since it shares the lot with a Starbucks. But despite going there at a semi-busy time, the employees (incl. manager?) were great at acknowledging the customers waiting in line for their patience. Even though it was busy, I received my order very quickly considering the wait.

Love that most of the items comes with a small bag of chips. If you order chips as a side, be prepared for a TON of chips...too much for one person to eat. Also love the free salsa bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try somewhere different for lunch.  She loves mexican food.  Well we decided to try Baja Fresh.  The food was ok.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   I would rather eat rubios or chipotle to be honest.  The table was dirty and we had to ask it be cleaned.  The service was quick though."}
{"text":"Just went there for my lunch and ordered steak tacos to go. I got charged for two steak tacos, but when I got to work it was chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Thanks to the staff at Baja Fresh.  Your catered meal for our meeting on March 6 was a hit.  I was able to cover all my special requests for no red meat, vegetarian and gluten free in one order and noone went hungry.  We had the Fajita Feast with both chicken and steak, all the fixings (plus a little more), chicken tacos, cheese quesadillas and the sweet churros to finish off the meal.  There was enough leftover for others outside the meeting to sample too.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the slight confusion and delay (15 min) in delivery, but a solid 4.5.  This is our second meal from this location and we will be back!"}
{"text":"right off the light rail prior to a basketball game i popped in here to get some quick grub.  it was quick, it was super excellent, and the staff were very kind to let me eat in as it was cold outside and they were 5 minutes from closing.  thumbs up for me"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years but enough is is enough.  Last straw was Friday night and I walk in at 6p and they are out of salsa... Like the whole salsa bar empty (the one with the broken sneeze guard that hasn't been fixed in over a year).  How the heck does that even happen?  Place is dirty too.  Doesn't seem like they have a manager there anymore.  When across the street to Chipotle and never going back."}
{"text":"There was a time when Baja Fresh was a sure bet for a 5-star rating from me -- and I know several other people who would agree.  Unfortunately, since it was bought out by Wendy's several years ago, the quality has deteriorated.  The upside is that now you can find Baja Fresh all over the country.  The downside is that it's only like it used to be about 1/3 of the time.

Recommendations:  Baja burrito w/ steak, pronto guacamole, and salsa baja."}
{"text":"Salsa! Baby! I love the salsa at Baja Fresh. They are always...I guess...fresh. It is your typical Mexican restaurant like a Taco Bell but way better. The restaurant is nice and clean. They have outdoor seating that you can enjoy if the weather is nice. The selections are decent and you can count on quality food."}
{"text":"I have to preface this by saying the experience was with takeout, not sit down and perhaps the issues were due to that. Anyhow it's simple: cold-as-ice food, no packets or small containers of salsa or any condiments of any kind, shriveled up tiny limes, the worst-ever Mexican takeout I've ever had. Just dry tacos, cold beans and so-so rice. The best part was the average tortilla chips. This was a big order for about 10 people in a corporate setting and it was just plain bad."}
{"text":"My coworker and I stopped there got lunch yesterday. The food tasted great but that night we were both sick to our stomachs. Another coworker saw our food and went there w her kids later that evening and also got sick. Her son found a geico in the bathroom!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in to grab lunch to go. It was warm in this place! While waiting for my order I noticed a few portable A/C units plugged in around the tables. I don't get it. The food was fine and the service was fine. No A/C though? Weird and kind of gross considering how hot it gets outside. How can a business stay open like that? Hello? Management? Owners???"}
{"text":"This Baja Fresh really didn't impress me.  It's pricey considering that all you're getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesn't have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since it's a corporate chain you can't expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to."}
{"text":"I love Baja, but this particular time, I purchased a shrimp burrito from them, and ended up with food poison!!! I was in bed for 2 days, couldn't keep anything down! I think the shrimp or maybe the guacamole  was bad on this particular day! I wont condemn the entire eatery, but you know once you get sick off of some type of food or at an eating establishment you never want to go back again? Well that's my feeling!"}
{"text":"Good price, super fresh food, very efficient staff (though I could get my food faster) considering there's almost always a few people ahead of you if not 10. I usually have greasy (tasty!) mexican food but these guys know how to give you something good and healthy so definitely recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food or service. Not that it was really bad, but I felt they could've tried harder. The cashier didn't even greet me and looked unhappy. She did say thank you afterwards. My biggest complaint was the food. My burrito looked delicious, nicely wrapped and very plump. But, of course, it was filled mainly with rice and beans. Where's the meat? I don't really see a reason to go back when I've had better burritos filled with meat before."}
{"text":"I don't really like their food, but I was next door and was starving. The place was disgusting with flies flying around, especially by the salsa bar and when i was up at the register. This should be in violation of health code.The trash container that customers use looked filthy and needed to be wiped down. The place looked old and i know they took over another restaurant that used to be there. I forgot the name. I got their carnitas taco and as usual, the meat was dry. No matter how hungry I am, I'll never go back again! Get rid of the damn flies!!!"}
{"text":"No A/C place is super hot terrible service and place looks really run down nothing but teenagers running this location and food sucked"}
{"text":"It's a Baja Fresh. If you are familiar with this chain then you know what you to expect. Good fast Mexican food and a salsa bar to pick and choose from.

The place was clean and the service was good. My issue was it was quite warm inside. The AC may have been having issues as I heard a customer ask about it. The temp inside was definitely cooler than the heat outside but that doesn't say much since it was like 115F!! Sweet Jesus! 

So sure, its good but not above average. Will I go here again? Um.. Will see. This isn't my hood so more than likely not. Will I go to any Baja Fresh again? Yes, sure."}
{"text":"Super upset with this place, ever since an Indian / Middle Eastern employee started working there it has gone down hill. She can't take orders correctly, gives you attitude and simply does not comprehend  what is on the menu. Apparently she is the supervisor Jamila M (502).  She always takes wrong orders. 

Today was the worse! Wrong order and on top the beans were burned. The salsa's did not have no flavor what so ever! Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I like to go to Comicon in downtown Phoenix and stay for 3 or 4 days.  There aren't many places to eat on the weekend in downtown Phoenix.  So one of my go to places is Baja Fresh.  Baja Fresh is nothing fancy but perfect for a delicious take out grilled chicken burro, chips, salsa and a cold drink.  I really like their salsa bar and all of the choices."}
{"text":"This place is packed during the lunch hour. They have stanchions up to control the lines. 
The food is standard Baja Fresh, good but not amazing. 
There is seating outside that is perfect when the weather is right. 

PS. The bathroom needs to be cleaned and updated..."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place.  You can get a healthy, great-tasting, fresh burrito bowl that totally fills you up.  And I love the salsa bar...if you get bored with one you can get a different one next time...or mix and match."}
{"text":"All baja fresh are not created equal. I enjoy Baja Fresh in Avondale, Scottsdale x2 & Phx. This one not so much. I will not be back to this one. There are just too many doing it right to be done so wrong again. I got a a Groupon & was so completely psyched because this meant a good deal on food I already have tried & enjoy. So on a Sunday at noon we hit this downtown location. We have a church down town we frequent & a Phx museum membership so we spend time & money down town on Sunday's. The burrito Mexicano was D-R-Y & tasteless. I think there was maybe a tbsp of pico on the whole thing.  My hubs ordered the Baja Burrito with his fave Carnitas & the burrito swam in juices after the fist bite but was also lacking seasoning. His burrito was a sog fest & couldn't be put down or it would have sat in the juice & not been able to pick up again. Our son got his usual quesadilla & wasn't disappointed in the least but come on it's melted cheese on a tortilla. He's been making these in the microwave himself since he was 6 not rocket science after 6. The salsa was missing tomatoes & was very very thin, tortilla chips cold & stale. The girl at the register on said Sunday a.m. couldn't even ring up the Groupon the manager had to. I'm sure when they are staffed & business is bustling for lunch & lots of turn over this is just as good as any in the valley I frequent but do not attempt this place on a weekend. One the hours really aren't conducive (close very early) & the food is left over from the week I'm pretty sure. Just not good."}
{"text":"We just ate there today Feb. 4, 2016 at 12:15p.  This used to one of my wife's favorite places when she was pregnant.   Wow has it gone down hill!

Two fish tacos, soup and chicken fajitas took 19 minutes to receive.  

Tacos were room temp and no Pico De Gallo or sauce. Fish was cooked nicely, it just needed to be hot.  

Tortilla Soup was completely cold and they were out of spoons.  Who sells soup without spoons?

Fajitas were hot and portion was generous.  But again no Pico De Gallo and no sauce.  

The salsa bar had no cups,lids or containers for take out. Employee did not answer when asked about it.  

Sweet tea was clear and just sweet water.  

Restaurant was very stuffy and hot and I asked to adjust the temp, employee did try but it wasn't possible so she opened a door.  Unfortunately now it was cool but six lanes of traffic and a construction site made it ridiculous.  

Never again."}
{"text":"We usually call in our order then go pick it up. The person who we spoke with on the phone today we could not understand and single word she was saying....at all. We had to ask her to repeat everything she said 3-4 times and then she asked us our name twice back to back. She had to have been reading from a pre typed card. It was very annoying and irritating. Clear communication on the phone is customer service skill 101. 
The food was ok this time; will probably use another baja fresh in the future."}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to try Baja Fresh because we had a coupon for a free meal. When we got to the restaurant we were told that they were no longer honoring the coupon despite it being in a coupon book for 2012 and it was 1-2-12. The lady behind the counter instead gave us $5 off so we ordered out food. We waited and waited and watched people that ordered after us get their food. The lady behind the counter kept asking the cooks where our food was. I then watched the lady behind the counter get food and put it on a tray. She the walked the food out to a gentleman sitting at a table and told him she have him the wrong food and traded the meals. The meal she brought back was them put on a tray and given to us.  Needless to say, we asked for our money back and left."}
{"text":"So they like the make your food, then let it sit on the counter for 5 minutes while you guess if it's yours or not, then act surprised that you didn't reach out behind the counter to grab it. My burrito was deflated looking, like it was filled halfway. It didn't even hold its shape. It also had a really unpleasant aftertaste. I didn't finish it in fear of food poisoning. Staff is always rude and disengaged. I see they're short staffed. The inside is filthy and they don't restock any of the utensils. Get it together, guys. This location won't last the year."}
{"text":"The food is good, if your going to use take out order in advance and ask for more meat, they can be a little light."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about this place lately and finally tried it tonight. Lets just say my stomach hasn't felt right since. I got the chipotle shrimp bowl and my boyfriend got a shrimp quesadilla. Both looked very unappetizing once delivered to our table. After a couple bites of my bowl, the cilantro was so overpowering that It was hard to finish it. Don't get me wrong, I love cilantro, this was just toooo much.

Another thing I found pretty gross were the bathrooms. Maybe its just me but I tend to judge the cleanliness of restaurants based on the restrooms. This one was smelly and in need of some scrubbin'."}
{"text":"Great service at this one just don't go right at noon. Too busy during lunch hour to wait. Just wish they didn't get rid if the low fat healthy bowls"}
{"text":"Terrible!   If you are in the Southwest I don't know why we would open these terrible chains of \"authentic\" Mexican food.  First, their design of ordering is not laid out well.  For a first timer (I was not), simply understanding what to order is difficult.  Second, employee in training was nice, but this location had 4 other people on staff & they could not handle 2 groups of 4 & me.  Us customers were 1 short of taking them 2 to 1.  Very poor service.  My 3 tacos.... 17min.  Third, food was just terrible.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by some of the best Mexican food in the world, but this was just wrong.  Chips were good!  If you like Baja Fresh, this may just be a bad location or a bad day, but you may want to try a different location."}
{"text":"Baja fresh is always delicious. Best carnitas quesadillas ever. I don't understand the low ratings based on the food. The service maybe, but not the food."}
{"text":"This is my fast food. Sometimes when I am on my way home after working 10 hours, and I am starving, I get grossed out thinking about fast food choices. Then I remember Baja Fresh. Is it fine dining? Of course not, but I am one of those people who needs decent food fast. 

I like their fish tacos with extra cabbage, black beans, rice, and lime squeezed in for that little extra something. They have been good every time I've been there, and the service is friendlier than your typical fast food burger joints as well.

In the end it gets 4 stars for good service, decent food, convenient location, and consistently feeding me when I'm hungry on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Chicken black bean burrito was surprisingly good. Their food has gotten better than it was in the past."}
{"text":"What to say.  For those of you who want a quick review stop reading and just go to chipotle.

Interesting and wonderful how innovation and competition changes our perceptions.  When baja fresh first opened it was pretty much the only quick Mexican food chain \"game\" in town and I thought it was good.  Then chipotle entered the game and the downgrade comparisons begin.  First the food is more expensive than chipotle but not higher quality.  For those with a healthy appetite, the quantity is also smaller.  We paid for our food and were given a ticket to wait for our food.  Chipotle again sets the standard as your food is prepared right in from of you while ordering and you get your food when you pay.  While on the subject of preparation, Baja does not provide any selection of ingredients for variety.  I know you can custom order a burrito, but it is not the same thing as seeing your food deliciously constructed before your eyes and being asked about each tasty new addition.  Finally there is the overall taste.  The burrito I had was good, but a touch greasy; very unlike the fresher taste of a chipotle burrito.  This baja restaurant lightly fried my burrito to give it a light browned appealing color.  Unfortunately the browning also dried out the tortilla too much.  Chipotle tortillas are always soft, warm, and taste like they were just rolled.  The only point that scored higher than chipotle was the salsa selection. Baja has a separate salsa bar where customers can serve themselves.  There is also a few more salsa types to select from.  I prefer the self serve option rather than having to wait behind other customers to ask for an additional bit of salsa

I've eaten at the baja fresh on university drive in Tempe and don't remember having the same less positive experience; but that was pre-chipotle too so perhaps it would be the same.  Ill let you know if I try this baja restaurant again and my experience is different

Happy eating"}
{"text":"BAJA FRESH!! 

The company stormed into existence years ago taking over the fast fresh mexican market but since Chipotle has been around on a large level over 8 years or so it has \"chipped\" away at their market.

In saying that I still love and appreciate both. And this location has never done me wrong. Been there many times and the service is always fast, busy or not(often it's quite dead in there actually a little sad)

But the food is always deeeelish! And unlike Chipotle or many other places these days they still give free chips and the best salsa bar around! Try the pico de gallo if you haven't!"}
{"text":"I tried the Chipoltle Shrimp Bowl.  I had them omit the rice, but I should have asked for more cabbage or lettuce.  There was a pretty large ratio of black beans in the bottom.  It still was very tasty.  I also ordered the guacamole and of course some chips.  It was a nice lunch."}
{"text":"I say Baja Fresh is the In and Out Burger of the chain taco restaurants except you cant get your burrito double double animal style (which is really too bad).

It is good, fast, and reliable, and much better than Taco Bell, it's just so fresh.  (A joke).

Too bad this locale doesn't have a drive through.  In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen one with a drive though.  Do you think you're not fast food BF... come on, BS."}
{"text":"I came in after an interview across the street.

The girl at the front was very rude.

I had a coupon for a free burrito and she wouldn't accept it. She said it had to be printed but no where on the email did it say that! 

I also tried to order a large drink and she snapped at me and said we don't have any more large cups. 

I ended up walking out and going across the Parking lot to Palermos and it was so good.

Go to Rubios instead!"}
{"text":"went a month ago so hot inside their prices are to high for what you get no mild salsa the food was ok but hot as can be inside   Hey people its hot outside wont go anymore"}
{"text":"Yes, its a step above fast food, but you pay for what you get. A few months ago I had one of their dinner plates and a drink, maybe an extra taco, and it was 11-something! For a few bucks more I coulda' gone to a sit-down joint and had REAL Mexican food! The food is pretty fresh and all that, but its rather bland and boring. I do like the salsa bar, load your own and take it to go thingy. They also have nice take out cups!"}
{"text":"The best food and service ever at baja fresh. Big thanks to our server Mousa! He did a fantastic job. We will come back because of him."}
{"text":"Hungry after a morning walk and an afternoon of shopping, we needed food.

It's been forever since I have eaten at a Baja Fresh...I think my age was still single digits.

We had just beat the crowd, when I ordered two carnitas tacos (baja style) and a grilled fish taco. We ordered some chips.

The chips, didn't taste very fresh to me. Kind of had a bite back to them. But, their green salsa, I would drink with a straw, so I just let the chips play in the pool....if you know what I mean.

The carnitas tacos were amazing. Tender, juicy, just the enough amount of seasoning.

The fish... I could have done without. Dry, almost tasted burnt. Flavorless."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is superb. The only negative side is that the place looks like it falling apart. The employees are always nice and warm! Fast service as well!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and bright.  We had a 'Deal Chicken' coupon and was pleasantly surprised that the young lady at the cash register was well aware of it and knew exactly how to handle it.  It came with a very large basket of chips and the salsa bar was excellent (especially if you mix the salsa and the pico de gallo).  I had the carnitas burrito and I thought it was too dry but that is sometimes true of carnitas.  However, it was a simple fix with addition of the salsa/pico de gallo.  My wife had the scrimp tacos which  were very good.  I am not much of a fan of rice in my burrito so that was a little bit of a turn off but then again I could have probably ordered it with no rice had I known.  It was a very safe place as there were 8 policemen there for lunch!! LOL   There are better Mexican food places in Phoenix but I would certainly not mind going back if I was in the area as it was quick and the selections were plentiful."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant in VA and now in NV.

Great food and consistent quality.

You can really taste the difference since they do not freeze or microwave their food.  Fresh upon your order and it shows!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Place took a tumble in the rankings yesterday. The order of fajitas was reasonable at $8 (minus $2 with coupon), but the food was not good and neither was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The fajita chicken was undercooked with some red appearing in one or two strips. Another strip was riddled with fat.  The salsa bar was a mess at 7pm as most salsa's were out and didn't seem to be refreshed in quite awhile. Corn tortillas served with meal were very thin and garden variety. Just a bad effort, but I guess I started relying too much on a few good meals. It is still a chain in the end. No bueno."}
{"text":"Baja is another staple in my lunch rotation. One of my favorite things about Baja is that I can be either really, really good with a healthy food selection, or I can be really, really bad. Either way, the ingredients are fresh and the food is good. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. 

I am a HUGE fan of salads, ever since Friday was salad bar day in elementary school, I have loved a good salad! However, with my salad I like good quality lettuce, with a nice color. Don't give me almost-white iceberg lettuce, no big yellow piece from the bottom, and no transparent pieces that indicate the lettuce was once frozen. Give me a good spring mix, some arugula or watercress, maybe some butter lettuce or romaine with a good green color. 

Baja's salads have good, green romaine lettuce which is of top priority when making or selecting a salad. Sometimes instead of the Baja Ensalada with Chicken, I ask for Grilled Shrimp! Other favorites include the grilled shrimp or veggie tacos (not on the menu, but they'll make 'em). The tortilla soup is good. Veggie Burrito or Nachos for when I'm feeling bad. And don't forget a good iced tea, my favorite (work-approved) lunchtime beverage of choice! 

As with anywhere around this area, lunch time is crazy! Get here before 11:45 or call in your order!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, service is too.  I had the Steak and Shrimp bowl, my wife the Mango Chipotle Chicken Salad. Both were excellent. Great fresh salsa bar with Mango Salsa, jalapenos, and several types of hot and mild salsa. We will return."}
{"text":"Grabbing a quick bite for lunch and the coworkers wanted to head here.  The place was very clean and the wait was minimal.  Our food was served hot, fresh, and quick.  We had a nice relaxing lunch and enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"I would rate this place four stars on the burritos, but other factors make it necessary to give two stars.

Remember back in the day when you got a heaping mound of chips with your burrito? Today I ot exactly 5 chips... No joke. And don't think of this place as a Mexican joint, it's not. This is an American style burrito place. With that said, I would appreciate it if they didn't blast the Ranchero music. I would venture to bet there was not one Spanish-speaking person in the restaurant outside of the staff. I have nothing against the language, but Ranchero is THE worst music ever. 

As usual, the burrito was good, but the company needs to seriously reconsider what they're doing."}
{"text":"Grill was dirty and they were cooking on it! Most tables were dirty and the salsa bar had more food out of the blows then in it 

Food was ok but I will not be coming back to this one"}
{"text":"One of the few chains I can get behind.  Baja Fresh already makes it a company policy to serve fresh food, no MSG, and tasty salsas made on the daily - that stuff you can find at every location.  The thing that sets this particular location apart from the rest is the staff.  The manager there, Rami, totally KICKS ASS!!! Super energy + inviting, he makes every visit a treat and not a chore."}
{"text":"we break(d) hard when i saw fish taco. i wanted to try it. taco bell doesn't have it and long john silver is not in NYC but Philly. i have to have fish taco! and i had it - it was hot like Arizona but it satisfied my curiosity and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"My wife and i love baja fresh but not this location. The service was so so and the air conditioning wasn't working at the time.  We both got food poisoning hence our apprehensions of ever eating there again.  Love baja just not this one."}
{"text":"I came here to get dinner to go tonight.  I got a steak bowl and Shrimp Tacos with rice and beans. Each dinner came with rice and your choice of Black Beans or Pinto beans. We both choose Black beans has iron and protein.  Both meals came with chips and y9ou can choose from 6 different salsas.  Everything was really good and as the name promises ,Fresh!   Very good andHuge amount of food. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is decent but this place is FILTHY! The bathroom had pee everywhere! The staff was just standing behind the counter while they were out of three kinds of beverages. It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time. I like the food but I'll never eat at a baja fresh again!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was fast, and salsa was spicy. Overall it was a good experience and I would return if in the area"}
{"text":"Please avoid!!! Absolutely the worst Baja Fresh  ever!!! Quality of food was totally scary. Ultimo Veggie burrito we got was so small and the grilled veggies were just very few pieces of overcooked onions, nothing recognizable and nothing fresh at all. We asked for guacamole in the burrito and we could only find a trace of it. The grilled wahoo burritos had chopped up small pieces of fish that tasted bad. Again, nothing fresh there either. They also did not come with chips like all other Baja Fresh we've been. Chips here are by request only and only tiny amount in small brown bags are offered. The signature salsa bar looks like a huge joke without happy chips. Extremely disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Haven't had Baja Fresh for some years. But was craving their burritos with the yummy chips and salsa bar. Walked in to see they have a LOBSTER burrito thing. Well that was easy.

We ended up getting that and some steak burrito, which I didn't care for. But the lobster burrito was delicious with lot's of great flavor and more lobster chunks than I had expected.

(Don't you hate when you forget to review after going to the place and then when you actually have time to write the review, you forget half the information?? Darn.)"}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner today.  I had a baja steak burrito and my daughter had steak nachos, along with two diet cokes.  My burrito was ok.  Megan's nachos were ok.  Neither one was anything special.   The salsa bar was a mess.  They say there are no tomatoes, so all the salsa they had was the green stuff and something else that was black and didn't taste very good.  There were no limes in the salsa bar, and I love limes, so told them.  I was almost done with my meal by the time they finally got them out.  Garbage was completely full, almost spilled stuff on the ground when I was trying to put my stuff away.  Tables were a mess.  But the employees had time to play grabass in the back.  I had a groupon, so got a good deal.  I won't be going back.  I like Fili Bs much better."}
{"text":"I really think that Baja Fresh has got it going on.
Every time I have ever gone to one any where,I am always impressed with the food. 
The condiments are always fresh and good, you can package it up to have as much as you like. 
Everything is cooked fresh while you are there, and I have to say it is really very good.
I have tried several locations and love them all. Staff is great, the place is always clean. 
You get a lot of food for your money.
Plus they do coupons a lot. Sign up on line at their website and they send them out all the time. Gotta love this place."}
{"text":"Went in here around 12:45 today and the place was packed but the service was still good. I waited in line for less than five minutes, ordered, and waited less than ten minutes to receive my food. They handle the lunch rush with ease. In my opinion, the food in general is overpriced but that's the same at any location. It is literally right off the lightrail, which is super nice. I usually go to Subway by campus but stopping here might become a regular thing for me now."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and this location is very clean. They have a fully stocked salsa bar and chips come with most of your purchases. I always get the same thing, the Baja chicken burrito. I'm never disappointed and the wait is always short. Perfect for a quick lunch break, and definitely a healthier option than all the grease soaked food locations that surround the area."}
{"text":"First off I love Baja Fresh but not after this last experience...  I went to Baja Fresh with my family (wife and  two year old daughter) they had to use the ladies room so they waited 7 minutes for someone to come come out so they could use it.  The person in the bath room was a hispanic Baja Fresh worker.  He told us he was cleaning but we could go in after after was done.  He then left and we went in\" it was disgusting.  Nothing was cleaned and we knew he was in their on his cell phone pretending to clean.  Then I went in the mens bathroom  and the bathroom floor was completely covered in urine.  The guy who was cleaning the bathroom also went stright from the bath room to cooking on the grill without ever washing his hands.  We were completely grossed out.  I got my girls back in the car and went in to talk to the manager.  The cook we had the run in with heard that I was waiting to talk to the manager and tried to maddog(stair me down) from behind the counter.  I told the manager what had happened and how disgusted we were.  I told the manager who also looked like he was probably intemidated by the workers himself.  Never eating there again after this...GROSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Baja Fresh is not Chipotle Mexican Grill, not even close. But, what they are is a interesting upscale casual Mexican fast food restaurant. They were owned by Wendy's for a time, and Baja Fresh executes on their menu items more often then most, Qdoba comes to mind. 

The quality of the food is good, but only slightly above average. Their newer seafood items are very bland and clearly they were aiming at Rubio's (one of their misses).  Prices are fair, but their main unique entree is their Salsa Bar which is very fresh and also very good!

The problem for the chain is that their locations are sometimes across the street from a Chipotle, as this one is.  I like the chain, but if I'm in my car I might drive pass them and go to Chipotle instead.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm surprised by Baja Fresh.

Almost a dozen years ago I remember going to my first Baja Fresh, when it was still a Wendy's concept in Illinois.  Arlington Heights, I believe.  The food was good.  

At the time, there was no Chipotle to feed that quick, upscale Mexican hunger.  So in many ways they were the only game in town.

As I mentioned in my recent Taco Cabana review, a lot has changed.  If feels like Chipotle is giving Starbucks a run for it's money in terms of new locations.  And, that food chain has only gotten better and still is the darling of Wall Street.  

Now Wikipedia has created a website, listing all the Mexican fast food chains.  Take a look and see how many you have been to:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fast-food_Mexican_restaurants  You'll get high marks in my book if you've been to a Taco Time and Taco Del Mar.

Here's the skinny, Baja Fresh does a nice job with their food.  I want to like them more than I do.  Their Baja Steak Burrito is really good and fairly priced for $6.99.  But as you explore their menu items, it becomes somewhat, un-interesting.

My suggestion would be to knock out that half wall that separates the kitchen from the front, so the customers could see the employees preparing the food.  Similar to that , er, other Mexican concept across the (FLW) street.  The employees here are exceptionally friendly and offer free chips as you wait.  Nice!

The food is good, but the restaurant with all that white, is kind of sterile.  The next time you get some coupons in the mail, give them a try as we did.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like how fast and fresh the food is at Baja Fresh. They also have a nice salsa bar. Much better quality than Taco Bell. (Though I do love me some Taco Bell)"}
{"text":"This place always has great fresh Tex-Mex! It even beats the fancy sit down upper end type restaurants hands down. Every meal I have ever had there has always been identical to any other location.

I can not recommend them highly enough and commend Baja' Fresh for their well run franchise type restaurant."}
{"text":"Got there at 10:30am right when they opened, very first customer.
The tables were dirty,
The floors were dirty,
Dead bugs at the soda fountain,
I peeked behind the counter and their were dirty dishes everywhere and stagnant
 water.
At this point who cares what the food taste like."}
{"text":"Worst Baja Fresh I have ever been too! Came here July 24th 2016 & we could not even finish our food because there is nooooo AC!! I had my pregnant sister with me and my 7 month old son & we left here sweating!
It's the middle of summer and you decide to stay open even though you don't have any air conditioning?!? Very unprofessional & will never return! Terrible experience.
They also were out of large cups"}
{"text":"I love their food, even if it took me more than two or three attempts to figure out that you can customize your burrito. I love that they supposedly don't use microwaves and only use the freshest ingredients available. I also like that they have the salsa self serve like Senor Taco or Filibertos, but it's fresh. 

Five stars, even if it IS fast food. ; )"}
{"text":"yummy! they brought back my favorite salsa...funny thing is i stopped going to BF because of this. i don't care for the other salsas, so i'd rather go to Rubios. but being as this place is so close to my casita, i'm lovin it! it has big chunks of jalepeno and its hot hot hot! i ordered the chicken taco (first time i didn't go with the fish tacos) and it was very tasty. not bad for a chain restaurant. it was overstuffed with everything delicious! i had to lightly top it with salsa, because it kept sliding right off. no complaints except for the guacamole. it was more like guacatomatoe. nothing to yelp home about. i don't care for tomoatoes in my guac, so i had to dig around them, and that left me with nearly a teaspoon full of guac. guess next time the guac will have to be homemade. one very surprising treat was the churro. it was very sweet and fluffy not the run of the mill under cooked center with crispier than crispy edges. i would definitely go back just for the churro with a cup of coffee...yummy i can just taste it now. hope i remember."}
{"text":"Very prompt and friendly service.  I got there at 11:30 ish.  I ordered the chicken tortilla soup.  It was pretty good.  And a side of rice and black beans.  Also very good.  The black beans seemed spicier than I was expecting and the rice had a nice flavor and was moist.  Also, I love the salsa bar.  So many delicious choices.  I will have to visit more often."}
{"text":"After a long day in Las Vegs, a group of four gals walked into Baja, with a desire to have some serious Fresh food.  The service from Alex was amazing.  He conversated with us and went out of his way to make sure that we were happy with our orders.  

Tortilla chips, Fire-grilled Skinny Chicken Bowl with AVOCADO!!!, and a diet soda. I was set.  The service was amazing, the food was cooked to order, and we were in and out quick, with no problem.  

If this wasn't a chain, I seriously would have considered giving it a five-star review."}
{"text":"The best place ever . We tried 3 items and all of them are kick a**.  God I almost had spiritual orgasm."}
{"text":"I watched Undercover Boss one night and the CEO of this company was on. Very moving and inspirational episode!!! Lots of tears and tugging to the heart. I spontaneously came here with my Mother and surprisingly.. she hasn't had any fresh Mexican food neither have I in a long time. So we were both in for a treat :)

It was around 5p.m. and we were kindly greeted by the general manager, that was also my cashier. It was nice to see he was hands on than a GM that just sits in the back office all day. Jose Garcia took our food orders and I forgot to get a drink, which he was more than happy to accommodate. He gave me a refillable plastic \"to go\" cup, which anybody can bring in any time to refill for .99 cents forever! So it says on the cup :D How nice!!! I love tea and they had four varieties to choose from... all you have to do is push the button of the one you want to drink and it pours out. I loved their sweetened Green Tea and Nestea Raspberry Iced Tea has always been one of my favorites.

We headed straight to their famous fresh Salsa bar... which had six different kinds to choose from. My Mother picked both Hot Salsa sauces and I picked the famous green sauce.. Salsa Verde Medium and the Salsa Mango Mild with tons of cilantro added to it. I loved the Mango Salsa the most out of all and I went back a few times to get it refilled. Chunks of freshly diced mango, red pepper, and jalapeno. You can tell it was made that day and it definitely had some heat to it, but it sure made everything taste refreshing and good. My mother enjoyed both Hot salsa sauces and the Mango salsa. Word of caution.. once you taste the sweetness of the mango, it made the salsa verde green sauce taste bitter. 

We ordered one Baja Chicken and Steak Burrito. It also came with a side of tasty golden torito chips, which had a nice crunch and ate all of them at the very end with my mango salsa!!! Delicious! The Steak burrito was hearty and filling. The handmade guacamole, melted jack cheese and Pico de Gallo made the burrito come alive. The Chicken Burrito was delicious and tasted better with the mango salsa. Both tasted so healthy... it was guilt-free to enjoy. 

My mother loved these burritos so much she asked me the very next week to eat there, but this time we took my father and they happened to be closed!!! It was 9:30p.m. and they were cleaning up. Now I know.. Baja Fresh closes at 9p.m. even in Las Vegas! My mother was so bummed and goes.. those are some good burritos.. where are we going to go now??!? :(  

Service was great and the salsa station was always refilled whenever anything looked half gone. Even saw the GM change a light bulb by the drink station as soon as he noticed it. He greeted every single person that walked through the door and asked how they were doing. Even some by name! He also came around to each table and asked how everything was. Very hands on and that is impressive. He was cleaning all around the place, taking orders, and answering the phone for takeout orders. He showed a great example of how to be a role model that people can admire and learn from. David Kim would be so proud!"}
{"text":"The Baja fish crispy tacos with cabbage are good - I substituted the rice/beans with a green salad.  The sauce on the tacos is awesome - yummy!"}
{"text":"Yikes.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa.

Cons:
The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews)
The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order.
The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier.
The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal.
The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross. 

If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 15 mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar.

This place would be better if they got friendlier harder working employees that actually cleaned the place up a bit."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today! Very good experience. Considering they were super busy for the rush. Got my food in a reasonable amount of time. And it was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"The food is good and fast.  This is a very busy lunch spot downtown.  However they always run out of salsa and that should never happen at a place like this."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh, a nice, quick alternative to your local Taco Bell...  It is a restaurant that I have been to many times.

Personally, I love their quesadillas.  They are extremely cheesy, and they are filled with your choice of meat, with some Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Salsa on the side.  Each one of the entrees have chips included.  Try some of their Salsa Verde with some cilantro... It's a very good combination.

If you really like their food, then buy their \"Collector Cup\".  For $9.99, it includes 1 free drink, followed by 99 cent refills for life.  A good deal if you come back to this place multiple times.

Good restaurant, good food, good place."}
{"text":"Nothing better than that black, roasted, salsa they have at their salsa bar. I had no idea they make their chips fresh at the location. I had chicken fajitas and they were great, the corn tortillas that came with my order were warm and fresh, wrapped in tin foil. Was a great meal for a great price."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Baja Fresh, but it's been adequate the last few times I've been there. Today the service was terrible. I went in to pick up my phone order. While I was waiting, there were a couple different people that were pissed off with the wait. MEANWHILE, they put my order on the counter without calling my name or the order out. When I finally realized it was my order, the manager (?) said, \"well why didn't you say anything?\" Excuse me? I'm so sorry that I didn't assume that the bag on the counter was mine, because THE STAFF DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. Don't blame the customers for your incompetency, or for your soft-spoken voices. Rude!

PS....my quesadilla was dry and my friend's burrito was so small that we're probably gonna go get something else."}
{"text":"Where did my burros go? Gone is the grilled fish burrito as is the bean burrito, leaving me with nothing but a grilled veggie burrito option. 

One of the nice things is the  chips given after ordering, giving one something to snack  on before your food is ready.

Also new is a \"Seasonal Salsa\"  This month it was cranberry salsa, it was different and not bad.

It can get a bit busy here but they seem to have a good handle on the rush. My one issue is you can not see the menu board from where the line is. This must slow down some people as it slowed me down.

If you love salsa and work near by or have a 2 for 1 coupon like we did give it a whirl. 

If a shaking floor bothers you get a to go order, I was surprised how much our seats shook as the train passed by.

** quick update all of that great salsa was only on loan. 4 hrs late it was all gone tanks to some food Bourne illness.***"}
{"text":"This is a shame. It has been 5 years since I have been here and it is disgusting. No AC, so they're using a portable AC. There is a shop light hanging from where a nice recessed light used to be in a failed attempt to highlight the beverage dispenser area. It looks like there was a break in because the patio door is boarded up and there are chairs and a table blocking the door. More than 50% of the ceiling tiles show signs of water damage. The doors below the beverage dispenser are falling off. All the baseboards are either broken or water damaged. We had a guest at our table the whole time, a fly that wanted to share our food. This location used to be extremely clean and the food was good. Sadly, this will be my last visit here. It shows an A sanitation grade from the health department, but I can't see when they came last. Hopefully they'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Back in the glory days of the Galleria Mall no restaurant chain was probably more frequented my me than Baja!  I loved Baja for their fresh ingredients and diverse menu items.  

Had to relive some old childhood memories and make a trip to the old Baja next to the galleria and use some precious entree coupons haha.  The food was good and the price was right as usual @ Baja!"}
{"text":"First time I tried Baja Fresh was in Vegas and was amazed. I didn't even know there were Shrimp Burritos! My entire family was delighted with what they ordered. During our entire Vegas trip, we all kept mentioning how we wished they'd have one back home in Tampa. Unfortunately, there are none that I know of closeby. There was one in  Wesley Chapel, but it seemed to have closed a while back. Anyway, give Baja Fresh a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's possible that I  was just really hungry . Is it my imagination or did my Baja Fresh meal taste really good?  I always like   Baja but it seemed really extra good. I  had three big kids with me and none of them were able to finish their food , but said  it was tasty and they were stuffing themselves to try to eat it all.  
 I had the grilled Mahi  Mahi tacos.  They were packed with fish , salsa, avocado  and  a bit of cheese. Tasty especially with  their mango salsa on top.  I barely finished mine , it tasted great. 

We also were given a large bowl of fresh tasting chips when we first got there,  a nice touch.  

Salsa on the Salsa bar looked fresh and tasty. I really wanted to try some others but I am a sucker for mango salsa. 

I am already plotting to go to the Baja ,closer to my area to see if it also is tasting extra good."}
{"text":"I love Mexican.. Burritos in general. Chips and salsa. Soooo good. I only go here once in a while since there are only a couple in town. I like to get the Carne asada burrito and put their medium salsa in it. Sometimes the kids meal is perfect if you need something small. A couple tacos can do the trick too. 

When I came in I saw they were short handed and told here to take her time. She took my order and then in threw a couple bucks in the tip jar cause I know how hectic it can get. She seemed really surprised and then smiled and gave me some extra chips. They pushed out the orders they had and then seemed caught up. Made my day with the chips."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food however my co-workers and I eat at this location ALL THE TIME! The service is great and we're warmly welcomed every time we come in (like 4x/week). I usually order the chipotle bowl with chicken or the skinny bowl with chicken. Both are fantastic. I love the pronto guacamole and it's a pretty affordable addition to my lunch order. The food is fresh, staff is great and the prices are low which is why I don't mind eating there on a regular basis.

The bathrooms could be cleaner (lost a star) and the parking is pretty awful. That said, I can get over a terrible parking lot for the service and quality of fast food."}
{"text":"I found an unwanted guest.

Was it on the top of my mound of rice like a loud warning, keeping me from engaging in my mid-evening food fest? Nope. Was it on the side of my meal, preventing me from eating my much anticipated plate? No. No, my fair friends. It was at the very bottom of my bowl of pinto beans. Lurking like a handicapped king prawn. Flattened antennae sprawled across the bowl bottom like wanton wet hair strands. Yes, its languishing frame lay heavy against the white, brown-stained backdrop of my already devoured bowl. That cockroach didn't stand a chance. The weight of several savory legumes, piled up, packed on and sealed in, must have suffocated the bugger. I can only imagine how its death essence must have marinated in my entrails before I swiftly exited the dining room and retreated to the can. 

Upon submitting a formal complaint to the management, I did receive a refund. But sour insult was added to salty injury when I was offered coupons to the same establishment! This was a special kind of face-palmed fail. If you're thinking of taking a trip to this particular Baja Fresh, I would admonish you to reconsider. Save yourself the pain of upchucking your hard-earned money. Go to Chipotle instead. At least there you can see your gourmet goodness made in front of you."}
{"text":"I use to come here once in awhile before my work moved to a different office.

Main reason being, their chips and salsa! The baja salsa is great! 

Food wise, the tacos are okay. 

Service is always great."}
{"text":"Somtimes that horse she runs and sometimes that horse she don't.

~ It can be good, but you never know (depends on who's in the kitchen).
~ Not always as clean as I'd like
~ They offer some healthy choices
~ The salsa bar has some really nice options."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of atmosphere when I go to eat somewhere. I know, judging a fast food restaurant based on ambiance might be a little unfair, but hear me out.

Before we even made it into the restaurant, we were immediately on edge. The \"hours of operation\" sign, usually a corporate decal, had been replaced by hand-written hours scribbled on a strip of paper. Not only that, but the aforementioned sign was taped to the glass using the tape they use to close the wrappers on burritos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw.

If that wasn't enough to put us on edge, there was the issue of the door. The handle was missing a bolt at the top, meaning that the handle swung back and forth if you touched it. When we left, this is what we saw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#eHCSZ4a1Y3GzTaOIXTDucw.

This location was probably a shining gem when it opened. Those days, however, have long since passed...which is really unfortunate, because the food is actually pretty good. Not only that, but their outdoor patio area is really cool! It has heaters for the winter, and misters for the summer. So much potential...all lost due to lack of upkeep.

The years have not been kind to this building. Perhaps they could use some of the profits they're making off of their food and use it to maintain their facilities."}
{"text":"Not very good parking. Restaurant wasnt very clean. 
Staff was very friendly, fajitas were good and prices reasonable. Will repeat."}
{"text":"Oh what a sad fall from grace... My previous review of Baja Fresh was very favorable. This one, not so much.

The experience started off poorly when the cashier sneezed in his hand while we were ordering. He never went to wash his hands afterwards. Perhaps he wasn't handling food directly, but he's grabbing chip bags, trays and other items right next to your food. Thanks for spreading the germs, dude.

As a starter, at least we managed to enjoy the tortilla chips & their wide selection of salsas.

For the main course, we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style. When they arrived, we were highly disappointed. The enchilada sauce didn't taste that good and the burrito contents were mostly cold. What part of \"Grilled veggie burrito\" is supposed to have cold vegetables?

With a brand new Chipolte across the street, it looks like we won't be visiting Baja Fresh any more."}
{"text":"This location is way better than the one by me in NY.  They have such great variety, and are very friendly about letting you customize a burrito so you get just what you want."}
{"text":"I like this Baja Fresh, but this location is going down hill... The staff seems to change a lot, always new people in training... High turn over rate. They seem to mess up on special orders so beware.... They speak Spanish to each other a lot and makes us feel uncomforatable, makes me think they're talking about us.... and it's just plain rude!  My biggest complaint is that they were swepting the floor right next to our table, literally right on top of our feet...It's like EXCUSE ME,  I am trying to eaty here! I don't want dust flying up into the air and landing on my food! They have done this there a few times now!  Why do they have to sweep & mop right next to the customers! It's annoying & insanitary I feel...  The ceiling fan s were also on full blast, further stirring up all the dust!"}
{"text":"We like baja Fresh, but this particular location gets 1 Star, due to their crazy unstable hours of being open!  They seem to close whenever they want! If it's not busy, they'll just close! ...esp, on the weekends!, they will close like at 2 PM!!!...I feel this is so stupid, considering that the Light Rail is literally right at their front door & people are getting off it like every 10 mins, so they are just losing money, & with all of the Theatre & Sports Events,...they are totally forgetting all of that, too.   Chipotle is just a few blocks away at Cityscape & they are open til 10 pm,,,,every single night, period!  ...Just go there instead."}
{"text":"Love the signature dark salsa they make here, Chipotle? whatever it is, its fabulous!"}
{"text":"Now you just can't go wrong with a burrito, freshly made, that's smothered with
red chile sauce & melted Jack cheese or verde sauce & Cotija cheese with sour cream & freshly made pico de gallo. Mmmm mmmm!  that's what you get at Baja Fresh if you order any of their delicious burritos \"enchilado\" style.

On my last visit, I ordered the Nacho Burrito . . . enchilado style. . . I wasn't disappointed.  Muy bueno!

Couple that with their homemade salsa collection from their fabulous salsa bar, and your tastebuds will dance.

Baja Fresh is my happy place. . . . I walk out of there satisfied and usually with half my burrito for dinner. Large portions, tasty fresh food . . . can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Nice location next to Starbucks shares outside area and free wifi from Starbucks is great."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a baja fresh for about seven years. After hooping, I decided to stop by with a couple friends just because of a random good memory I had with the place.

  Upon walking in I noticed the entire restaurant being pretty dirty. Tables, drink station, and salsa bar were a mess. I went there around 2, so maybe the mess is due to the lunch crowd before I arrived. The service was very pleasant and we received a lot of friendly smiles. One of the girls even took our plates for us. 

  My friend and I ordered the same thing, a chicken bowl with added steak and a drink. The price was roughly $35. I really enjoyed their salsa bar. Though I enjoyed all of the sauces, the Pico was my favorite.  The rice we got in our bowl was soggy and not very appetizing, the beans were okay, the steak tasted like boiled beef stew, and the chicken was amazing! That chicken, I will definitely order that again! 

  I will be coming back because of the friendly people, the delicious chicken, and the generous salsa bar. Hopefully the rice will be better next time."}

I like this place and tell myself we should go here more. The place is clean and the staff is great. The food is fresh and tastes great. Not sure why only a 4 but thats where I stand. 

I prefer the pork over the beef and the chicken. It just tastes better."}
{"text":"I've been to Baja Fresh only a handful of times over the past few years mostly because I have never been really impressed with it. My last visit there was on par with the rest.

Upon entering and getting in line, I experienced about a 15 minute wait before I got to the cashier. It appeared as though there were four people working and one of them appeared to be in training. Once my order was in, a nacho burrito with steak and a drink for $10, my number was called just as I was topping off my Coke Zero(which is a huge plus in my book that they offered it!).

The burrito itself was okay. The ingredients appeared fresh enough, however the composition of the burrito itself was just off. One half of the burrito appeared to be just beans, rice and salsa, whereas the other half of the burrito had a few strands of beef, the nachos and cheese. I know the cooks were in the thick of it during the lunch rush and all, but it's nice to have all of the ingredients available at once for your tasting pleasure in each and every bite.

After the manager came by to check on us and clear our trays, I had asked him if any of his employees called out sick. He informed me that two had, one of which had the flu, and he was not going to allow him to come to work (phew!). I applauded his honesty and felt for the guy knowing he was doing the best he could with the staff he had on hand. The initial wait in line was completely justified, however the food itself just did not do it for me. For a $10 lunch burrito, your money is better off being spent at Chipotle, and I think your stomach, wallet, and palate will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Well first off, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that has noticed what a dump this place has become. I used to love Baja Fresh and would come here probably once a week (this was probably 8-10 years ago) and it was great. I hadn't been here in probably at least 5 years until about mid July I decided to go for lunch. 1st red flag...THERE WAS NO AC INSIDE! It was probably 115 outside and 95 inside. They had 2 small portable units that didn't do a thing. According to OSHA and I'm sure health codes as well, THIS IS NOT OK! I got my food and tried to find a table to sit at but there weren't any clean tables. So I found the best I could find. 3rd red flag...As I was eating, the people sitting across from me at another table had a black widow spider crawling next to them that luckily they saw! I also notice the disgusting ceiling right above where I was sitting. I should have left the second I walked in. I actually wrote to the corporate office to let them know as well to see if anything gets fixed. I actually came back just last week to see if it had gotten any better...nope still no AC and everything just as before....I walked right back out."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and edible, but very forgettable.  I had the mango chipotle chicken salad without the shell.  Overall it was okay, but the chicken portion was very small - maybe 2.5 ounces.  The menu choices overall are hard to choose from and unless you get a salad without the shell or a single taco, the remaining choices are 700 calories plus.  A veggie burrito for example is 800 calories.  It has been awhile since I have been to Baja Fresh and I suddenly remember why. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's Baja Fresh, what can i say? It's clean, they're fast and it's a hell of a lot better than McDonald's. I usually call in my lunch order from work and it's almost always ready and waiting when I get there to pick it up.

I do have to say that their pico de gallo is great and I could probably live on just that for the rest of my life. I get extra cups of it and eat it all by itself."}
{"text":"Okay Baja Fresh, I like you.

But, I like Chipotle better.

I usually get some kind of salad bowl thingy from Chipotle, so I tried Baja's grilled chicken bowl, but it didn't really stand up.

It was just okay, but not great.

The grilled chicken was fresh, but I can't figure out what they put on it so that it came chargrilled orange. (?)  Strange, but the taste was okay.

The chips that come with every meal are pretty bland and seemed a bit stale.

There were some okay sauces on the salsa bar.  I did like that part, but the ones behind the counter at Chipotle are better.

And just in case you want Chipotle now, there is one in the same shopping center as this one. Ha."}
{"text":"Closed.  Rent went up and they couldn't keep the doors open.  This is my go to place on late nights at work.  Sad."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Baja Fresh is a poor man's chipotle, but that's an insult to poor men everywhere.

First off, I think everyone in Phoenix is missing the gene where they actually listen to directions.  When you order something, you shouldn't get ANOTHER.  Totally got that, it ruined the start of my vacation and it made me sick the entire time I was in Phoenix.  Ironically, I never stepped into a Baja before, but I learned my lesson to eat dirt rather than eat here.

I ordered a burrito bowl (I think it's called \"bare\" burrito), and I asked for whatever the hell it was, and you have to special order steak or chicken.  I said neither but Iwanted guac.  No problem they told me.  I hate chicken and I got it anyway.  I didn't know until I got back to my conference.  Note to self: they fuck you in the drive-thru.

Anyway, it wasn't even that GOOD.  And it made me sick.  Did I mention that?  I don't totally blame Baja though.  Chipotle did its part in pissing me off for the whole trip.  Baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Salsas were bland. Music was too loud and distorted in the speakers.  Stained ceiling tiles. When paying with credit card the ticket asks for a tip amount. Seriously?  This is a fast food joint, not a sit-down restaurant with table service.  I don't expect to return. Should have gone to Rubios."}
{"text":"This location is great!!  What makes it better than Chipotle? The food is fresh and prepared to order, the kitchen is in the dining area so you can watch the food being made.  You won't find gross cafeteria food served under heat lamps and warming trays here.  

My favorite is the Baja Burrito, I really hadn't been a fan of guacamole before but this burrito is so delicious!  Recently I ventured out and tried the Nacho Burrito, which is also great! I didn't find it spicy though like it was supposed to be, but no complaints.  

It had been a few years since I had last had Baja Fresh and am very happy I got hooked on them.  Also, if you sign up for their Club Baja online they send you emails every so often for $2 of $8 or $5 off $15, both nice savings if you go often as I do."}
{"text":"I have loved Baja Fresh since the beginning....but something has tragically happened recently.  There is no consistency at this Baja.  The burritos are either really good or \"so-so.\"  Their black bean salsa is so good that I could drink it.  But lately, it's been watered down with no real flavor.  I know there has been a lot of competition for good Mexican food in this area- but come one, Baja!  Don't go down without a fight!"}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again...The manager was rude and I had to walk out and refused to eat there. I eat at Baja fresh all the time ... just not this location. I tried to order what I always get and when I gave my coupon that  was emailed to me that I have used 25+ times....They refused to take it...I explained that I use it all the time at the other location....All I got was no no no. So I left and I will be sure to NEVER go to the Baja fresh near the Galeria mall again. This franchise might want to review their employees and policies so they can all follow the same rules..."}
{"text":"Great location with a super friendly staff. Food is always good. I love the salsa bar, especially their new seasonal mango salsa - quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as much as I LOVE Chipotle's.  I have been going to Chipotle's so much (I think that put some thing in the food to make you CRAVE it) that I needed to break away to try something else.  We spotted Baja Fresh, so hey....  It was good, staff was friendly, but it was not GREAT!!  

I got the bean and cheese add chicken burrito & chips with queso.  The bean was ok, I did not see or tasted too much cheese, and the chicken was ok.  The chips that weren't too over fried were good, but we had 50% that were overly brown.  The queso was pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm a Chipotle person, so for whatever reason, they were closed early, and decided to give Baja a try.  I ordered some spicy chicken nacho burrito thing that was suppose to be full of zip.  They hand you a small bag o chips and then you wait for your number to be called.  I got the burrito.  Flavor is lacking, and the zip is suppose to come from the peppers in the burrito-- that's it, the problem is there is more rice and beans in the thing than anything and the chicken had little flavor.  To make matters worse, the place has 4 or 5 televisions playing Fox news.  Yuckoo, I wonder what political party this place caters too.  Politics aside, I don't care for the food, the business model, or the decor."}
{"text":"Good food! 
Beware of lunch time, bad parking & packed. Call ahead & order food!"}
{"text":"Okay Ive been to Qdoba, Chipotle and now here. Qdoba i wasn't impressed, Chipotle, you get your money's worth but Baja Fresh blows them out of the water! The first time I went (Monday) I had the Shrimp Diablo. First let me tell you, I like spicy.. like nose running, tongue swelling spicy, got me? im not saying it was that hot but it packed a kick that none of the other 3 came near and that's without drowning it in available hot sauces. Not only was the spice level sensational the shrimp are not little canned geisha shrimp, they are \"multiple chews\" large and they don't skimp on them either. Last but not least they pack that burrito with an equal amount of everything.. not 80% rice. This burrito is as heavy as a bar of gold and it's defintely worth it's weight.

P.S. I know my rule is go 3x before 5 stars but that doesn't apply to \"fastish\" food."}
{"text":"Baja and anything ending in \"Berto's\" are about the same, except Baja is more expensive, with a much smaller menu and probably a bit healthier and definitely fresher.

Fish tacos rock it, so does the carne asada and the Baja salsa looks like coffee grounds or lava but it tastes amazing with a totopo de maiz."}
{"text":"Easily the worst \"burrito\" I have ever had.
It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today. The food is as expected, it's good.  I really liked the 6 chilis salsa for the chips and my steak Mexicano burrito.  4 stars for the staff, they were very friendly and helpful.  Building could us a bit of attention, some broken tiles, etc."}
{"text":"I ate here, eating out the only time during the weekend, and sure enough it hit... food poisoning. I only saw one person in the food area so I can only assume cross contamination. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Normally love Baja, but this one has been very disappointing. Shrimp tacos, taste like rubber. All but one salsa was worth eating. Beans are a no go, and rice was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja Fresh, go to another location, they do have good food!"}
{"text":"I had to stop by since all the ones around me are long gone.  The steak nachos are to die for, no skimping here, plenty of guacamole and sour cream.  This location is super clean and has a well stocked salsa bar.  I had totally forgotten about the pineapple salsa! so good!  Prices are on the high side but if you join their email club they will send coupons regularly."}
{"text":"Spent almost 2 weeks in Vegas and ate there at least 4 times.  The burritos are exceptionally large and the shrimp tacos and quesadillas were very good.  A little high priced for fast food but worth the price."}
{"text":"I was shopping for a car on Camelback and wanted to grab some lunch so I popped into this Baja Fresh.  It's a standard franchise with indoor seating and a complimentary Salsa Bar.

{"text":"After having some Baja Fresh at the San Diego Airport on a recent trip, I was in the mood to have it again, so I stopped by this location.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try something new and ordered a Nacho Burrito (Chicken, Jack & Cheddar cheese, Pinto Beans, Rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, Jalapenos, Salsa, $6.79).
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=AqQo_Yxp0xhQO5owbgCVow

While I was waiting for my food, I got some of the Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.

The Nacho Burrito was OK, not great.  I wasn't too impressed with it.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't seem to be as tasty as I had imagined.  The Salsa, which was supposed to be Spicy, was mild....bummer.

Overall, it was an average visit for Baja Fresh.

{"text":"I don't come here often, but when I do I order their Chicken Nachos.  As I've mentioned before, after I realized how many calories are in one of these bad boys (2,020 calories!), I reduced the number of visits to Baja Fresh.  That's 3 hours on the Elliptical for me!

This location is convenient because it's in a shopping center with Walmart & Sam's Club nearby.....which are 2 places I frequent.  Of course, their signature Salsa Bar and plenty of seating is available.

Will I return?  When I'm in the mood to gain some poundage, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"Another Groupon casualty!  I bought several Groupons for this location and used only one.  Then we went to go use another one the other day and *BAM* it's gone!  Another one bites the dust.

Return Factor - An obvious 0%."}
{"text":"I must say Baja fresh was the veteran (well in Vegas atleast) for the fresh Mexican food trend. If you'd rather have others choose your burrito/taco toppings for you this palce is for you since all of it is already determined for you. I usually get the baja burrito with steak, pretty tasty. I probably like their steak best compared to thier other popular competitors.  I also recently tried the torta with chicken, which is a new menu item.  The grilled vegetables was a nice touch and the bread was pretty good too. But I must say the bread was a bit too fluffy, if that makes any sense? Their prices are about $1.50 higher more or less than Chipotle's or Qdoba because their menu items automatically come with chips. Unlike the others which have it as an option. I really do love the salsa bar, which gives them that little edge. One more plus is they probably have the most menu options. They also help out the community by offering those Baja Fresh fundraiser nights, shows that they care about the communities they cater to. Sad to say I probably visit Baja Fresh the least probably because their food doesn't taste as fresh as the others."}
{"text":"The funny thing for me and Baja Fresh is that I was never a huge fan. BUT... I became more of a convert after I saw the show \"Undercover Boss\" on CBS. The big message I took from it was the work that goes into the food and keeping things very fresh... especially for a \"chain restaurant\". 

Big plus for me is definitely the \"salsa bar\". It's tough making a decision when there is a Chipotle directly across the street! And a more upscale Mexican food restaurant in the same shopping center (Pinatta Nueva). 

The food here is good, not outstanding. I also think that it is a little pricey for what you get (portion wise). Given a choice.. I will try to seek out a Filiberto's any day of the week! (Please do not flame me for that comment!!!)  

The other good thing about this location... is if you have some room left in your belly.. there is a Cold Stone directly next door for dessert!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch and had the $6.99 taquitos.  Food was okay for the most part, but the atmosphere just completely sucked.  Loud ranchero music over and over again to the point you can't hear yourself think.  I have had good mexican food, but this place could do better.  Bathrooms weren't too clean either."}
{"text":"A few months ago I would've given Baja Fresh five stars. No joke. I don't know if it's me getting older and more frail, but for some reason my body can't handle it as well as it used to be able to and I go into a food coma for a good 45 minutes to an hour after eating it nowadays. 

If that doesn't slow you down, it actually has some of the more authentic tasting mexican food around. Cilantro dominates the smell of the entire restaurant, and they even have a wide selection of salsas of different varieties for all to sample. I am a fan of the burritos, but, then again, that's almost unfair. I'm a fan of just about every burrito I've ever had. 

The chicken quesadillas are good but are heavy on the grease. Unless you have a stomach of steel (like I used to) go with the tacos or a burrito."}
{"text":"Placed an order, paid, and waited about 10 minutes before the cashier comes to the table and says they have to close. The cook didn't show up! Why couldn't the shift manager at least hop on the grill to complete the orders. It was not busy. There is no excuse for that behavior. Then as they issued the refund the manager said he was not coming in tomorrow. That is HORRIBLE service. This location should be closed permanently!"}
{"text":"I just don't like Baja any more. When I was in high school we would come all the time. I got the chicken burrito and it was just OK. Way more tortilla than filling. It came with chips and I got a large refillable cup but they only have the nasty golden peak cartridge tea. Why can't people stick to good ole fresh brewed..

The staff was super nice both when they took my order and I let them know they were out of ice..for 10$ my meal was just ok.."}
{"text":"ehh the food here is only OK but will fill you up. Don't trust the other gringo reviews that say its the best thing since sliced bread. They do a lot of promotions so I usually get 50% off an already low price :) There new bowls aren't all that but there burrito and tacos are decent."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else! Trying to get dinner on a Sunday night sign says they close at 9, at 8:24 doors locked !! Tried to get someone's attention to ask what was going on and employee just looked and me and look away... Horrible customer service! Spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great location. Angela is the bomb! Outstanding service."}
{"text":"While certainly not an authentic Mexican eatery, the food is consistent and decent.  The Fish tacos is what they are good at and what I enjoy the most.  They always come with a good portion of grilled or fried fish, cabbage, pico de gallo and avocado slices.  If this chain ever comes to Honolulu they better use fresh fesh!  Wahoos is ok and Tacos del Mar so and so, Maui tacos is hopeless, sorry it is what it is, and I know what I like. 

What sets Baja Fresh apart from the other fast food \"kinda Mexican\" food places like Wahoo or Tacos del Mar is the salsa bar, it is  well organized/displayed with 3-4 kinds of salsas, mild, hot, dark roasted and the  (pineapple salsa is amazing by the way) and there is also pico de gallo, lime slices, cilantro, onions and sliced jalapeno peppers.  It's always nice to have a few more extras in your meal and try out new flavor combinations."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to grab lunch. I wish they would bring back the mango salsa. Went today and felt dirty being in the restaurant, there was so much dirt on the ac intakes and the ceiling tiles were stained from leaks and you could see where liquid had actually ran down the walls. The management here needs to put the cleaning gloves on and their glasses apparently. The food was not memorable and not worth the money."}
{"text":"This location is now closed."}
{"text":"I try my best not to go to fast food chains , but this place is definitely different , every thing is prepared to order and is fully customizable to your like or dislikes , I usually go for the tostada salad these days which is awesome , it's filled with your choice of meat , fresh romaine lettuce , guac , cheese , pico and choice of black or pinto beans in a crispy flour shell ( which is so hard not to eat the whole thing ) , the flavors are great on everything I've ordered here , used to rave about the chicken quesidillas but have been trying to eat a little healthier ( that's why only eat part of the tostada shell lol ) , there salsa bar is regularly stocked and fresh as well ,  beware tho of their queso and chips which can leave you with a craving at the oddest times , usually when they are closed !! It's a rather large serving of chips with a smokey chipotle cheese sauce to dunk those freshly made chips in, Omg yummy !! There are way more health conscious choices available , but I like what I like lol ! So if you are in the mood for some freshly prepared Mexican food , that is relatively good for you and is not Taco Bell or some tackily decorated mom and pop shop where greasy is king then this is the place  you gotta try !!"}
{"text":"Really close to my work...you really can't bet a fast, affordable, semi healthy lunch.  I really like how they have changed their menu to include the health information.  Helps to make a more informed decision.  The staff at this location is very friendly.  Gotta love a free salsa bar and chips too! 
Will I be back to this location?  Definitely."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive but Some of the best Mexican Food In Vegas. Come Early in the Day to enjoy the Full Assortment of Salsa's and it IS UNLIMITED CHIPS.  Just ASK.  The Grilled Fish Taco's are Amazing.  Avoid the Deep Fried Fish Taco."}
{"text":"Dude. Baja Fresh is GOOD. I had a shrimp diablo burrito. Now while the burrito tasted nowhere near as diablish as i would have hoped it would, it was still good. I thought it would be spicy. Not so much. But the shrimp were large, they tasted grilled, and the burrito was stuffed to the gills with them. 
I noticed that at the salsa bar they now have a monthly rotation of a new flavor? Is this new or have I not been to a Baja Fresh in quite a while? Anyway, they had this awesome pineapple-onion-cilantro mixture. Sounds weird - tastes FREAKING AWESOME. I could lap up a gallon of that stuff on its own. 
Another plus - customer service at this particular location is off-the-hook awesome. I left a personal belonging in the store and they held it for me to pick up the next day. Sounds typical, right? The personal belonging was cash. So yeah, they're awesome at this store."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Here I am, a chipotle lover for 5 solid years, and Baja Fresh sneaks up and just blows it out of the water! How this place isn't more popular absolutely blows my mind.  Many more options than Chipotle, and it seems that their food is indeed extra fresh. Gimme a god damn burrito from baja any day."}
{"text":"No freezers, no can openers, or microwaves- this is probably my favorite fast casual Mexican restaurant. I've had the tacos (fish tacos are good), the fajitas (the chicken fajitas are very good), and a few of the burritos, but my favorite menu item is the Diablo Shrimp Burrito- shrimp, black beans, rice, jack cheese and spicy sauce. I got my husband hooked on it, except he has the sauce on the side.

I was curious about the langostino lobster burrito so I got it this past weekend. It was not good; too much rice, I mean, overstuffed with rice. I don't like too much rice in my burrito.

I'm giving high marks for the following: good service, fresh food, free drink refills, clean restaurant, and your choice of salsa (sad about discontinuing the mango salsa but the pineapple salsa is a nice alternative- a bit spicy but I like the kick). I almost forgot to mention that it's reasonable. Also available is covered outdoor seating. They do large orders- Party Packs. Do some shopping while you're in the area- Target, Buffalo Exchange, Albertson's, TJ Maxx, and Toys R Us."}
{"text":"Was good (although the prices were steep) until I saw the cockroach crawl across the dining room floor. I stomped it and lost my appetite. Wish I had read the reviews first. : ("}

{"text":"Very bad Customer service. Bad smell in the store the girl who served us her name was Michelle she was so mean and rude. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Like Chipotle, Baja Fresh is one of my top fast food picks. The food is quality (and about as \"healthy\" as fast food can get). 

This location, however, has a lot going against it. The place is in a very high traffic part of Scottsdale. It's in a very small spot that shares a tiny shopping center with a Starbucks. There's virtually no parking, so if you go during a busy time, you're probably going to have to drive out and around, then park down the street. Also there is very little room for the lunch rush line, so everyone gets very uncomfortably close trying to stay inside so they're in the air conditioning. There's also no real place to wait for food, so if all the tables are taken you end up standing in a lot of people's way. 

If you're going to pick up food from here you should order ahead, or go during the off hours."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this place and after looking at the menu online, I was excited to try it. I adore Chipotle and that type of fresh mexican style food, so this seemed perfect. Yeah, not so much... 

I had the shrimp bowl which is apparently new to the menu. Maybe they need more practice or refining on this item because it was not good. The rice was bitter, the veggies tasted like burned oil, and the shrimp were chewy. The only semi-redeeming things for this meal were the pico and guac that I added. My husband had the 2 taco combo and he said it was \"meh...\".  We had to spend $15 to fulfill the Groupon so we got a churro - yum!!

I dint think we'll be going back any time soon... Chipotle has won our business."}
{"text":"We had this location cator one of our events. We ordered two platters and it fed 10-12 people with no problem. The food was wonderful and the service was spot on... We had to customize one of the orders and they had no problem with that. We will be return customers!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I always like Baja Fresh. The cashier brought out food to every Hispanic person anyone else had to come and get it. Which, I expect at this place. My question why treat one type of people special."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars, but I'm rating them 4  to bring up their score. 
For some reason, my friend Sage is addicted to this place. I don't know why. So we always end up eating here. 
I don't really like Mexican food, but when we want something cheap, and fast this is a good option. I like the different salsas especially the mango when it's in season. It's in a great location with plenty of parking spots, and we always get great service from the staff."}
{"text":"ordered food for our work pre Cinco de Mayo festivities.
I ordered Cheese Quesadillas, 40 Chicken Taquitos, Guacamole and Chips and Churros.
I ordered thru EzCater so it could be their fault but Im pretty sure the food was delivered by someone from Baja. I requested delivery at 4 and they arrived about 3:20.  Entirely way too early.  I tasted a churro and it was so delish but by the time the party started it was very chewy and there was no dipping sauce for the churros either.
The quesadillas looked amazing but were all kinda stuck together. There has to be a better way to pack those.  The guacamole was very tasty.  Creamy, taste of lime with just a little spice. Overall, can't say Id order catering again because of how it was it was packaged."}
{"text":"Yum. Baja fresh is the place to go if you want something a step up from Chipotle in variety and warmth as far as the food goes. 
It's not finger licking if I don't have this I\"m gonna die good, but the food is made fresh, and the customer service is always excellent
Highlight: the plethora of salsa choices as well as fresh cut limes for your meal & if you so choose your coke like beverage. :)"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, no lard, no freezers, no MSG. Clean store with an enthusiastic staff. Calorie counts on menu boards detours me from eating more fresh fair.

Great inviting energy from Store Manager Rami. 

There seems to be a lot of regulars here. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"...so basicly ... i went in here to get something to eat .. but first i used the restroom ... this girl comes pounding in the door saying youve been in restroom 10 minutes ... lofl seriously ...then when im done i come out i ask whats the problem she says youve been in there more the ten minutes ... you can only be in there 10 minutes ...seriously wow ... thats how you treat ypur custimores .. you seruously goin to time them in restroom ... then kick them out and say ypur calling security ... worst experience ive ever had at a so called wanna be resturant ...do not come to this baja fresh on flamingo and maryland parkway !!!!...if you feel like takin the chance of gettimg harrassed ... and possibly embarsseed in front of people ... then come to this baja fresh on flamingo  and maryland parkway mission center plaza ...biggest waste of time of my life and wirst customer service ive ever experienced in my life ...if you like to be interrupted  by this woman well your in the restroom  ... then comw here by all means ..."}
{"text":"The last two times I've been to this place the food was absolute garbage.  Onions are always rancid and the tomatoes were green.  At one point they were out of coke and salsa.  Had to get my $ back and leave.  Maybe one of these days they'll get their chit together and put out a good product.  Same experiences at the Sahara/Decatur one.  The only one that had been consistent was Charleston and Ft. Apache."}
{"text":"Before I write anything else about Baja Fresh I got two words for ya: Mango Salsa. OMG do they sell it to go in large quantities? I need to ask when I go back! 

It took a bit longer than I liked to place my order but that's the only complaint I have about the place. It's clean, the service once they get to you is fast, and it's priced right. I liked the salsa bar...the 6 pepper salsa was really good but it took a back seat to the over the top mango salsa. That stuff...is pure awesomeness in a little cup. 

I ordered a wahoo bowl, and as I was looking at the bowl I didn't see any processed or artificial crap. I saw fresh veggies, perfectly seasoned and flavorful fish, not too much rice, and the portion size was good without being excessive. That's important when you're trying to watch portion sizes and you find a place with good food. 

Will I be back? Absolutely. I'm looking forward to it. 4 Stars definitely seems appropriate here.

{"text":"My daughter and I frequent this place.  I am addicted to their veggie burrito and E is addicted to their cheese crisp.  It really is fresh and simple meixcan food.  I also like their chips and salsa.  Good price, good food, good service...this is what keeps us going back"}
{"text":"This was my lunch today...

The primary issue that will kill this place's business is there is NO FREAKING PARKING!  Show up with a handicap placard and you are front row, but the rest of us... 1/2 mile during the lunch hour!

Baja Fresh is the exception to my rule: Don't eat anywhere that has a drive thru!  The establishment is very clean with attentive and friendly staff.  The service is actually quite impressive for a \"semi-fast food\" joint, because they actually have an Expeditor that does his job!  I really enjoyed watching 'the machine' pump out lunches at break-neck speed.  On to the food...

I ordered the Smokey Queso Fundido (appetizer) and Steak Tacos.  The Smokey Queso Fundido is basically tortilla chips and a saucer of a cheesy dip.  It was quite flavorful and rather economical.  While not listed on the menu, if you ask for Pronto Nacho's they will provide you with a 3 oz. version for $1.49 (vs. the $3.49 menu size).

The steak tacos... ehh.  True to their name, all of the ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  The steak, however, was a touch on the dry side.  I found myself putting salsa, which was stellar in its own right, on the tacos just to \"juice them up\" a bit.  I did expect a little more moisture... and seasoning for that matter as it seemed kinda bland as well.

All in all, I would absolutely return.  If for no other reason than because their receipts have $2 off the next $8 order or $5 off the next $15 order if you take their survey.  I have no problem reviewing food  :-)"}
{"text":"I can't give a chain 4 or 5 stars, I just can't. But if I could, baja would get 4 stars. I have enjoyed BF for 10 years now and it never gets old. They still have the best salsa bar on the west side. Don't hesitate to stop and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I love Baja Fresh. So good. Their beef and chicken are hormone free which is plus. Fresh food and great prices. Not the friendliest or best service/ staff there, but what can you do? Its close to be fast food, but fresh fast food. 
I usually get the nacho burrito, which I saw about 10 other people order while I was there today. I was with a friend. He ordered a 2 taco plate. They forgot to put his order in. Eek. Bad, Baja Fresh. Disappointment!!! He got coupons for next time he visits. Good save there, Baja Fresh. Otherwise this review would be very low. I despise bad service. 
I hate chains usually, but this place is always fantastic. I like the fresh food, always delicious."}
{"text":"it was my first time coming here... to be honest the only reason anyone should ever go to baja is if there isnt a rubios anywhere within a 5 mile radius, the tortillas here were too tough to cut through with a fork and knife.  menu is kind of weird and the service sucked, told her it was my first time and she couldn't recommend anything..

the one saving grace is the salsa there, the baja salsa is so amazing, honestly im thinking of buying the burrito at rubios then going to baja for the salsa.."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on several occasions for lunch, and have really enjoyed my experience here.  They have a great menu with fair prices, and a good amount of food to fill just about anyone up!  Service here is always quick and friendly, and I usually enjoy my time here.  

The only downside, is that this place always seems to be insanely busy every time I go on lunch during the week.  I don't always have time to blow 20 minutes on my lunch to go here, but when I do, I always get really good food.  I've been getting the tacos here when I do eat at Baja, and thier pretty darn good.  They even have a salsa bar in the corner!  Minus the lunch time rush, this place is worth a stop in to eat at, any day of the week.  I will be back in the future for more!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and had a pretty so so experience.  I ordered, and the price charged on the register was higher than the sign.  When I brought this to the cashier's attention they did not know how to handle it.

My order was slow, nothing special, yet three orders after mine came out ahead of mine. 

Once I finally got my food it was ok, but nothing special.  They would have gotten three stars from me if the service would have been better."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes at the counter, only customer in line. Wasn't even acknowledged by the people scythe front line. Turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"i'm impatient. so i should have called in my order. they took a while to get my ultimo burrito done. not enough meat. too many bell peppers. next time i'll get the baja burrito. chips were really oily. like it was from the bottom of the frying basket. usually its just a couple.. but they were all like that. service was bad. the cashier greeted everyone with an 'you ready?' .. which isnt really a greeting.. and when you werent ready he kinda shifted his weight to his other side and his head followed his body. like he was being scolded.. and wasnt listening. anyway.. i'll try again and hopefully add another star."}
{"text":"Loved the one I had to drive 30 minutes to get to in WA, was thrilled to find them all over the LV Valley! I am so addicted to thier smoky queso, I could hurt myself eating this stuff. I use it as a treat to reward myself with for long days or finished projects. Today I tried the tortilla soup because I was feeling under the weather. Wow! It's cheesy and spicy and really yummy. Can't believe I've never tried it before!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Baja Fresh in probably 3 years. My coworker so graciously sprang for lunch the other day, in celebration of my engagement, yay! 

Their food is always consistent and yummy! I had the grilled veggie burrito, same thing I used to get back in the day. Very tasty! She got the Grilled Shrimp Salad, she was very excited about it so I am going to assume it was awesome! There was a huge line but they got threw everyone quickly and my food didn't take to long. 

It is a big of a drive from the office but I think it might be worth adding it to the lunch time rotation!"}
{"text":"Let me just say I like Baja fresh, mostly for their variety of great tasting salsas @ the salsa bar. I also appreciate the cilantro is available solo - not mixed with onions like @ Rubio's.  I do prefer the food @ rubio's but you get what you pay for calorie wise - so if it tastes better its probably worse for you. If I could combine Rubio's food with Baja Fresh salsa, it would be perfection. 

I recently went to this baja fresh location on Ash Wednesday before going to mass down the road. I was starving and ate like a prisoner about to take my food away, yup it was that serious. I hadnt eaten really all day b/c ur supposed to fast on Ash wed and are only allowed 2 snacks and one meal but the 2 snacks cant equal the one meal - somethin like that. 

I went with the 2 blackened mahi mahi tacos (that I normally order in Hendo by the Galleria) which are normally really good. Unfortunately this was mahi mahi was so dry, blackened ( and not in a spice way but a burned way) maybe they didnt know thats what that meant? 

ah well I ate it b/c i was starving but i probably wouldnt order it again from this location."}
{"text":"I love Baja Fresh. sadly I didnt know this till it was too late. I used to live in Vista, CA where there was one within walking distance to me and one day I was craving it hardcore and realized it was closed! NO!!!! and the closest one was like 45 min. away. So when I moved here to LV I realized... Game on! I love their mahi mahi tacos. blackened espec. ! I love ALL their salsas. . the only thing I wouldnt order again was their Chicken Tortilla Soup.um. . more like woudl you like some chicken with your BIG BOWL OF ONIONS? yuck. I've ordere this soup at many other places typically b/c this is one of the semi healthy things u can have @ a mexican rest. and i've never seen this many onions in soup b4.. not even ONION soup. . . So I'd never order that again but other than that.. everything I've ordered here is always so good. giving Rubio's a run for their $."}
{"text":"This place is about as good as it gets when it comes to healthier fast food.  It's our go to fast food restaurant when we don't feel like cooking and want something quick."}
{"text":"What you gonna do? It's fast food. Very basic and devoid of character.  The only saving grace here is the communal salsa bar.  Sure fine, this place is alright, not disgusting or the best ever.  Just as average as you can get."}
{"text":"I frequent this location a lot. It's a fav of mine. Not located in a good area but it is a great store. Salsa bar always fresh which is pretty important to me. Love love love the salsa. They have a great lime salsa, pick salsa, hot salsa.. You name it. They will always give you chips with whatever u order even if your meal doesn't come with chips. You can also buy a refillable cup that you can bring back and get dollar refills. Most of their stuff you can make pretty healthy. Patio area outside is large if you want to sit outside. Overall great place and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Used my @BoldBajaFresh @Groupon for lunch today.

I've always been a fan a Baja Fresh, and ate there quite often in CA.

The distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.

I don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.

The chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me.
Rather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.

They came out hot and fresh, and delicious!

It was a nice display of customer service, an increasingly rare trait these days.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"I like the food here but it seems as though it's hit or miss on getting it fresh. On one visit, I ordered a Baja salad and when I got home the salad looked like it was a few days old. I've also noticed with all the new restaurants opening around them they are a lot less busy and as a result don't have as many staff on hand so it takes longer to get your food. Dinner time there was one person running the register and serving and one person cooking.
Not a bad place if you don't mind waiting a while for the food if there are a few people in line."}
{"text":"My burrito bowl had ingredients that were fresh off the grill.  Every single item was grilled, and it made me wonder the oil content.  It was good though.  The complimentary chips were the best part of the meal.  Unfortunately, everything in my bowl was super spicy.  I usually can take the heat, but this was like an inferno!"}
{"text":"I'm okay with Baja Fresh, but I don't go very often.

I appreciate the salsa is fresh and kept clean. I like that the food is fresh and doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna have cardiac arrest.

I tend to like Burrito Bowls and I thought it's rather weird they charge you to \"upgrade\" it.....Uh, you saved a tortilla by puting it in a container, isn't that not a \"downgrade\" ? I would think they wouldn't charge you $1.50 to do that. 

It has the same amount of food in the bowl as a burrito so you didn't really get more for the price which I initially thought was the price difference. Seriously- unwrap one and throw it in a bowl and see. Sure, they add lettuce, but it's not even much. Only other \"upgrade\" available- enchilada/wet style burrito....that makes sense since you're gaining sauce and cheese. I guess make bowls at Chipotle, do a burrito at Baja. 

 I know, it's a small thing, but it's rather weird to me!"}
{"text":"Great manager and staff at this location!  Takes a few minutes for  the orders, but that's because it's all made fresh and you can sure taste the difference.
Grilled Mahi Tacos are awesome.  Great salsa bar with the best jalapenos!  Could use a few options without cilantro for Gringos though :)."}
{"text":"They gave me lemons for my fish tacos because they were out of limes. Other than that it was a decent Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"With a name like Baja Fresh, you probably think what you're eating is somewhat healthier than other fast food joints. 
Think again because Ba-hahaha, the jokes on you! Baja Fresh, or Baja Fat as it should be called is extremely high in fat and calories for most of their food items. And consequently, that's why everything tastes so good. 
I know they have some lighter options, but the majority of stuff is a heart attack waiting to happen. A meal here is not unlike going to McDonalds or Burger King. 
Trust me, I made the mistake of going to their website and looking at the nutritional content. 
And like any other fast food place, I still eat here- just not often."}
{"text":"I like Baja Fresh!  I can't really attest to what others have said about other locations being better... I have only eaten at this one.  But I've been there about 10 times now and have had no real complaints.  I like the mango salsa.  Yum."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos (including a mahi-mahi variety if you're into that).  I really like the salsa bar, not too overwhelming, just the right amount of condiments to choose from.  This place was a godsend when looking for a quick bite in downtown Phoenix.  Every other place I walked by looked really beat."}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, lots of salsa choices, and CLOSED

Good little places to get away from the standard fast food.  Likes their salsa bar and services was usually quick.  Sorry to see that they are closed as of around 4/1."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food here, reminded me of Chipotle a little. Too many onions and green peppers in the burrito I ordered, but I liked the freshness of everything, as well as the outdoor seating. They need more umbrellas or shade, as there was not enough seating outside for other customers that also didn't want to eat in direct sunlight."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh was a staple for me in high school, since it was just down the street and right on the way home. I always appreciated how high-quality their chicken was but always thought that the dishes were a little bland. In particular, the salsa bar offerings weren't that flavorful. Lately, it does seem like Baja Fresh is trying to take it up a notch and compete with other chains like Rubio's and La Salsa that are offering more upscale, California-esque things like portobello tacos and salad burritos. I appreciate the innovativeness, but find that despite good-quality ingredients, most of Baja Fresh's dishes haven't changed and are still bland. Oh, and their salsa is still so-so. 

We went for lunch the other day because we had a coupon (buy one new fire-grilled taco combo for $6.99 and get another for $1.99). The combo came with a tropical chicken, blackened shrimp, and a \"diablo\" steak taco. The shrimp taco was definitely good and the shrimp themselves were good-quality. The chicken taco was also ok, and I really liked the grilled pineapple slice that was tucked inside. The diablo steak was kind of chewy and not that spicy, as the name would suggest. As it had been on previous visits, the salsa was mediocre. We left feeling satisfied and full but not wowed by anything. Next time, I'll probably stick to tacos or burritos and avoid the new dishes."}
{"text":"This store is very clean, speedyA and accurate. The three times I have eaten here I have received EXCELLENT service from Giselle. I am a big fan of friendly service and cleanliness. This store does what it takes and has great employees."}
{"text":"Loved it! Swung by here for lunch with a TON of girls and we mobbed the counter with really specific orders.
The cashier was kind, attentive, answered our ridiculous \"does this have...?\" \"does this come with...?\" \"yes but can I do that with this instead of that?\" questions, and even let a couple of us change our orders after we made them.

Food was AWESOME, I got the 2 taco combo with pulled pork. It was surprisingly juicy, and I literally moaned when I took my first bite. SO good, I felt so healthy after, and they even let us pull together 6 tables.

Great Baja Fresh. I'll go here any time I'm in the area. For sure."}
{"text":"The food is good, I usually go for the ultimo burrito.  They have a nice fresh salsa bar with peppers and limes.  They also give you a bag of chips to snack on with your food, which is nice while you wait for them to make your food."}
{"text":"Super solid! I have been coming here for 10 years (scary) and I couldn't love it any more.

Burrito Ultimo steak Enchilado style! Seriously, don't hamstring yourself by ordering anything else!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at the lone Baja Fresh in Raleigh, NC before it closed, so I was excited to finally be able to eat some of their fish tacos once again.  They were as good as I remembered them being too! I got a grilled and a crispy fish taco.  Both were good, but the grilled was probably the better of the two.  The atmosphere is pretty standard fast food style with fairly plain decor, but don't let that make you think the food isn't worth it.  The service was friendly and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"closed?  Sign on the door says the landlord seized everything."}
{"text":"What separates this chain from others? Nothing. Their concept is that they use fresh, healthy ingredients with no freezers in the house, which was fine and dandy in the 90s putting them ahead of the fast food Americanized Mexican chains. But the rise of the fast casual, custom restaurants left Baja Fresh eating their dust. The minimal variety of selection for burritos and tacos which have set ingredients make it a hassle to customize your food to your liking. Combined with prices that are elevated compared to others pretty much leaves this place off my list when looking for Mexican.

I went to this location twice in the last month. Once to pick up a catering order and the second time to have lunch because I was in the area. Although, it was wasn't too busy during the lunch hour, the place was cluttered with uncleaned tables. Language barriers made ordering more difficult than it should have been. I had the steak Burrito Mexicano ($7.39) which was a typical burrito with rice, beans, salsa, onions, and cilantro. If you're looking to fill up, you can find larger burritos for a buck or two less. This burrito didn't do the job for me.

I used their catering to order their Fajita Fiesta for a company meeting in which I needed to feed about ten people. Ordering over the phone 24 hours prior was a breeze with all options covered and the order was ready when I arrived except for the chips which were in the fryer because the manager wanted to assure I had hot chips to take with me. For $70, you have your choice of two proteins, flour or corn tortillas, peppers, rice, choice of beans, cheese, onions, guacamole, cilantro, salad with dressing, and the aforementioned chips with salsa. This was plenty of food for 10 and probably the only thing I would recommend from here."}
{"text":"The food's fresh, the service is good and we eat here fairly frequently. We like the baja burrito with fried fish :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative rating I would. My wife, 4 year old daughter and myself stopped in for lunch expecting a nice lunch. Well, as we all know they play Latin music in their establishments. On this particular day they decided to play whatever they wanted. While eating I noticed that there were F-bombs ad S-bombs being played over the speakers. I asked for the manager to complain and he gave me some excuse that they have no control over the music. BULL SHIT!! I asked for the corporate number and gave them a call. Turns out they have assigned stations that are to be played.
  I have no complaint about Baja itself, I do have an issue with this location. AND for the little sharpy eye brow wearing Mexican bitch. Who the hell are you to tell my wife that my daughter doesn't look like here? you might want to keep you papers near by just incase a few of my INS buddies decide to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my nacho pressed meat glue chicken burrito... This burrito is horrible just nasty as I speak I am waiting on Jorge Rivera the owner to call me back.  I am requesting a refund take ur food back its 5-31-16 @ 7:51 pm and I spent $37.14"}
{"text":"Friendly, ready to take your order but pushy if you are not ready to order. Dining area really needed attention of cleaning and for the amount of people there it was an usually long wait for the food."}
{"text":"I had not been here in a while, as I usually bring my lunch to work with me.  As my tummy told me that lunch time was near,  I looked up to see the free cup and $2 off coupon a Baja Fresh worker had handed me several weeks ago.  [My frugality funds my splurges.]  That was all I needed to inspire me to get my lunch here.  I was kicking myself for heading out right at noon, usually a downtown eatery nightmare, but they handled the load well.  Getting folks through the lines quickly, yet awkwardly as I had to weave my way through a couple of doors, the salsa bar and a maze set up to maximize the people in line. 
I ordered the Baja Burrito-Bare Style with Carnitas.  Bare style essentially means it is served like a salad.  I was impressed.  The Romain lettuce was fresh and crisp, the carnitas savory  and the salsas were fresh and quality.  I will likely go back, as I did take the survey online and got another $2 off coupon, but even if I didn't have a coupon I would go back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"They are unapologetically slow, fresh, clean, and full of quality, tasty, good stuff....

how could I not love Baja Fresh?  It's just like ME!"}
{"text":"When in the area, and craving fast food Mexican, Baja Fresh offers pretty good food, for OK prices.

I like that we can pay more for a large plastic cup, and get discounted refills for life, even though we always forget to bring the cups with us, as our Baja Fresh stops are generally last minute, unplanned stops.

Sadly (for the others) Baja Fresh is better than a lot of the sit down Mexican restaurants we have tried in the same area lately. 

The food quality is very good, nice flavorful, well cooked menu, we will be back, as we're tired of being disappointed by waaaaayyyyy overpriced Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge selection of great tasting food, have tried pretty much every except the shrimp tacos and it is all great. All food is made fast and fresh by friendly people. If you haven't tried it and would like something better than Taco Bell then it is a must."}
{"text":"This place is really good it's a chain restaurant but the food is always fresh I always get a taco salad or sometimes a burrito"}
{"text":"OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here for lunch today and they had lobster tail tacos.  I come to this location about once a month.  It's incredibly clean and the service is always friendly.  I like to see confusion on peoples' faces when I break out my Spanish and place my order.  
The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans.
Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh.
There are NO microwaves here.  I have a \"thing\" about microwaves and rarely use mine at home.  I think it's strange to heat up food without something...hot.  *shudder*
Anyway, it's a clean facility with fresh food and many different options.  I'm still thinking about my langostino tacos, even if this is a chain."}
{"text":"This location is great! My favorite is the chili lime shrimp salad; it's made perfectly each and every time! The manager and staff are excellent! :)"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to stop in here for dinner after walking out of Panda Express around the corner(EEK), because the food is always freshly prepared and delicious.
I ordered the three fish soft tacos(shrimp, mahi-mahi, white fish) and a side of chips/salsa. It took less than ten minutes for my order to be ready as it certainly wasn't busy at the time I was there(8pm, they close at 845pm).
I love the fresh salsa bar that has a choice of 4 different kinds of salsa, sliced limes and jalapenos(all complimentary).
It was a little pricey for fast food, but I understand that its all made fresh to order while you wait.
The location is on the East side of town, not the best area, but its a nice clean restaurant and the customer service is exceptional."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go to Baja Fresh regularly. They have a clean establishment, good service, great food... and their menu is very friendly for people with allergies!"}
{"text":"Quality of this fast food is better than most.  Tortilla used for the burrito was delightfully soft and a bit flour-y, and the frijoles con queso inside were tasty.  Prices not bad.  Salsa bar could use some improvement.  Seating is decent inside, but parking is bad so just give up and park in the grocery store lot nearby."}
{"text":"This my 3rd time coming here .. They would of got a 4 stars but today he want to serve dude behind me because  I'm on the phone..  Ok I have my ear piece in so why are you skipping me as if I'm not as important.. My other ear works just fine!! Hella rude.. And they always get your order mess up. Customer service suck if your not a Hispanic and that's not coo. I support every restaurant and I'm sadden by this. Wow and he got his food before me after the fact I told manager he was after me. He did ring me up before him and that's after the fact I said something. But I look and he's eating and I'm still waiting wow .. And he's white go figure"}
{"text":"I rarely give 1 star reviews but this place is terrible. I wish I would have gone to Rubios like I planned but I wanted to try their wild wahoo fish tacos. 

 First off they STILL have NO  AIR CONDITIONING in this record setting heat. When I walked in it was sweltering hot, can't be good for the food laying out. I went on Sunday and Jeanne M went last night (Tuesday) and said it was still not working, totally unacceptable in this heat. 

The girl taking my order was nice but as other reviewers have said this Baja Fresh is dirty inside and not kept up. When I went to get water, since the Iced tea had a \"out of order\" sign on it, the water sprayed all over the place. Now for the food. 

The fish was completely dried out and tasteless. The avocado in the taco was turning brown and looked like it had been sitting out all day. The whole taco was so dry including the tortilla which completely fell apart when eating it. The beans were undercooked and the rice was also bad. Just a horrible meal. 

The corporate office should be embarrassed for what they are giving their customers at this location."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh is one of those places that is neither memorable nor forgettable--it just is what it is. Situated in the courtyard of the office tower in which I work, BF is a convenient lunch option when I've forgotten my lunch in the fridge at home. I enjoy the freshness of their food and that it's made to order, and that the workers seem to be constantly cleaning. The salsa bar is always well-stocked and offers a good selection. Today I ordered the Nacho Burrito, enchilada style, and found it quite tasty. 

It won't knock your socks off, but it's a fairly-priced meal downtown that remains consistent. If you go, stop by my office and we'll dine together."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh was a new discovery when I arrived here.  With an office downtown, you like to walk around and find new grub joints. This one became a favorite - a short walk from the office and tasty too. 

My fave item is the Baja Buritto with steak, no onions and add sour cream. Your order is made fresh, so you'll have to wait a bit for it, but it's worth it. They have a dining area which can get crowded during weekday lunch rush. They also have a salsa bar, so take some and enjoy! 

Hint: Frequent visitors can save money on beverages by buying the large, reusable plastic cup with straw and lid...every visit after that it's only 99 cents!  This holds a LOT of drink!"}
