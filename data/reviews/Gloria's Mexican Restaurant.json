{"text":"We just saw Gloria's had opened and decided to try it for lunch.  We ordered a margarita each and received some free chips and salsa.  The margaritas were on the sweet side; not my favorite.  The chips were fine as was the salsa.  Warm chips would have been better.
Our food was reasonably priced and tasty.  The atmosphere could use improvement as off-duty employees were hanging out yakking with working employees and it just did not seem like a business.  More like visiting strangers in their home.

We will give it another try as the food was good."}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico and it is hard to find food that makes me feel at home. Gloria's does just that. It's delicious, get at this place. If you don't like tacos, that's not cool."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day, which was fish tacos, beans and rice.  The fish was lightly grilled with cheese with spicy mayo.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"While they are still new and have some kinks to work out, I think the service and food was great! My family enjoyed the queso fundido as an appetizer and my son couldn't get enough. The food came out very quickly, even though there wasn't an empty table. We are definitely going to go back to try some more menu items! Perhaps even a margarita :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in Madison/Middleton. The prices are great and the staff is so friendly. We are from California and often times can't find similar Mexican food to what were used to but this place is pretty close to perfect! We love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Crab, shrimp and veggie stuffed enchiladas with rice and beans.  Absolutely delicious.  Would come here every day if I could!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow.   Once I received my order, it was not correct and food was not very tasty.  I can't say I will be returning."}

in the last week
My husband and I had the pleasure of eating at Gloria's tonight. This is a very new restaurant and eventhough the service was a little scattered (it was busy), the food was fantastic and reasonable. I ordered the Caraones A La Diabla and I'm still thinking about it. It was honestly one of the best shrimp dishes I have had in a very long time. My husband ordered the Burrito Mexicano and really enjoyed it as well. I also ordered a specialty cocktail (I forgot the name) with tequila, fresh squeezed orange, lime, grapefruit and grapefruit soda that was served in a ceramic urn-like cup with a salted rim...it was Awesome!!! I highly recommend Gloria's for a casual night out. We'll bring our kids with us next time."}
{"text":"Went on taco and margarita Tuesday--I'm so happy Gloria's exists! $2 tacos and margs make for a happy after-work relaxation. I got the veggie tacos which you can customize with a variety of toppings. I added avocado, broccoli, and zucchini to mine and they were absolutely delicious. I'm getting hungry just writing this.

The margarita was really good especially considering the price (you'd think it's be watered/juiced down, but the tequila was definitely there). They only come in one flavor, lime, but it was tasty.

Wait staff was friendly, scenery was fun, food was filling--perfect trio. I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Pacas veces puedes encontrar un lugar donde quedes satisfecho con la comida , bebidas y el gran servicio no te arrepentir√°s de ir a este gran lugar"}
{"text":"Nice place to dine in Mexican food. I have been here twice and liked the food both the times. Casual environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very nicely done interior setting and very friendly staff. Food is well priced, authentic and delicious. Really enjoyed coming here for lunch. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I am surprised at the ratings for this restaurant.   We have tried twice.   Both times the food tasted ok but was cool/warm, not hot.  Serving sizes ok.  Service slow.    They brought out our pitcher of margarita( which was 75% ice) and we had ask 3 times to get glasses.   And about that pitcher of margaritas.  It was straight up premixed/ overly sugary -- not good.    One of our group ordered a frozen strawberry margarita,  which was very good but there was an upcharge for strawberries and for blended...seriously?  Don't know what we missed.  My husband says a 2 is too generous."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison!! Gloria and her staff are excellent!! Family owned and operated they make sure you are satisfied!! 

I had the steak haurache and strawberry margaritas!! It was better than expected! 

Great service great environment!
I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. It is an independent, family-owned restaurant, which I like. Amazing horchata, great chips and salsa. My tacos were good but not as flavorable as some I've had. I was very pleased with how efficient the service was - I was able to eat here almost as  quickly as if I'd just give to a fast food restaurant. That's a plus if you're on a time crunch and makes it an appealing lunch break destination. Decor is nice and some of the other entrees I saw coming out looked amazing. I will definitely be back to try some more of the offerings."}
{"text":"Ever since coming to Madison, I have wished, wished, and wished that some good, authentic  Mexican food would come on the west side. Yes, there are a couple places that are around, but, those places just barely hit the spot. I was THRILLED to see Gloria's open up and was even more excited to try it.

The restaurant is a small, cozy, and simple atmosphere. There is a full bar with seating. I was instructed to sit wherever I'd like. Even though there was just one waitress, service was overall quick and polite. 

The drinks menu includes a combination of beers, wines, and cocktails. I didnt expect so many options considering the size of the restaurant. To sweeten the deal, many of the cocktails were classic combinations with no premade mixers. I enjoyed a luxury margaritia, which was a classic margarita with some agava nectar, using top shelf liquors. Perfecty mixed and served with salt on the rim.

Chips and salsa will come to the table without request. Food is fresh made to order - an issue that I identified in many Mexican restaurants in Madison. I ordered the Carne Asada a la Tampiquena. In otherwords, skirt steak with an enchilada. It also came with a little chorizo,  rice, beans, guacomple, and pico do gallo. All flavors were spot on and the food was served out. The verde sauce on the enchilada was bold and accurate.  The flavors and quality were on point. The only consistent issue I've identified is that they have flan only half of the time that I come.


If you are looking for good, authentic, top quality Mexican food on the west side of Madison, look no further."}
{"text":"Madison needs more authentic Mexican eateries, and Gloria's has the potential to fill that gap. Super fast service, decent quality food. Complementary chips and salsa like it should be (plus the salsa has a yummy little kick to it)! 

They're not trying to reinvent the wheel here. And when I compare it to some places I've had in SoCal, it really doesn't hold a candle. The margaritas we got were way, way too sweet. 

The burrito Mexicano was pretty average, with chicken, rice, beans, pico. The rice was a little dry. Really nothing to rave about at this place. It's new, so hopefully they'll amp things up a little, because right now they're not living up to their website claim of \"Madison's finest Mexican food.\" 

Just a note that the traditional dishes don't come with sides, they're a la carte."}
{"text":"Great salsa, service, menu options, environment and prices. The Tacos Dorados are delicious but could use more sauce or guacamole. They were pretty dry after the first few bites. But some people prefer that so, to each their own. I'm hoping to go after work someday to try their margaritas."}
{"text":"Very good selection of homestyle Mexican. I had camarones a la diabla which were served with hot fresh tortillas. Prices are very reasonable for good sized portions. Chips on table could be a little fresher but aren't terrible. Definitely enough interesting things on menu to come back."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food. Family owned. Berry margarita was tasty, but frozen berries we're hard to drink.
The enchiladas Mexicana was good and fajitas we're good size. I don't eat flan, but my uncle ate it up.

Friendly owners and wait staff. Small environment, family friendly. 3 out door tables for patio seating."}
{"text":"Delicious, very authentic enchiladas (one was chicken verde, the other plate was chicken mole).  Very nice staff, cute little place.  We will for sure be back to try more menu items!  Lots of vegetarian and seafood items that sounded wonderful!"}
{"text":"Just delicious! Ambiance not great but the food was excellent and margaritas good. Owner came around and asked how we liked everything which is so nice. I think they will do well here. All the best! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Since moving here from Los Angeles, I've searched and searched for an LA-type Mexican diner.  The kind where the food is authentic, nothing is \"white-i-fied\" for fear of scaring the natives, and the price is right.  No cheese whiz on a tasteless burrito here (like a place that shall remain nameless in Middleton).  No $17 enchilada plates that taste like they belong on a Cheesecake factory menu.  

Gloria's has authentic Mexican delights.  Real hangover food like Chilequilles and Huevos Rancheros.  Rellenos that hit the spot and remind me of the mouthfuls of happiness I had at my favorite local haunts after a night out at beach bars. Tamales - daily.  And mole that doesn't taste like Martha Stewart made it for a polo-tournament in the Hamptons (like a place on Odana that shall also remain nameless).

One suggestion:  Make the Rellenos bigger or bump it up to two rellenos per platter (even if you have to charge an extra buck).  Otherwise, perfection.  And don't worry about any negative reviews from midwest folks with underexposed tastebuds.  We brown folk, who've lived all over the country LOVE your food!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Authentic Mexican restaurant in madison.  What's best is how fresh the food tastes, the salsa is awesome as was my mojito...so delicious!!!  All four of us cleaned our plates just the perfect amount of food!  It's not a big restaurant but they move people through at a nice pace...we didn't feel rushed and the food came out nice and hot.  Loved the authentic corn tortillas just so,so good!!  The menu is excellent lots of choices, there were at least 10 things I'd order so I can't wait to go back.  I feel bad they've been open since March and we first made it there tonight....I've had so many lousy meals around town I wish we would have tried Gloria's sooner.  GRACIAS GLORIAS!!!  See you soon"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended Gloria's! And I'm so glad she did. Even though it's brand new (opened just a few days ago), the experience was wonderful. The food was authentic, flavorful and just so.stinkin.delicious! The restaurant is small, but the decor is colorful and very welcoming. Nice drink selection (I recommend the Tequila Sunrise and Mojito!) I had the chicken quesadilla and my boyfriend had the chicken chimichanga. We both loved our meals and will definitely return. The staff was incredibly friendly and made the experience that much better. Kid-friendly. Very reasonably priced. Good portion sizes. Two tv's. Mexican music playing. A liiiiittle disorganized, but that will happen with any new establishment. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak burrito today and it was bland! Ingredients were fresh but no taste! Not sure I would ever go back."}
{"text":"This is great smallish place. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and responsive and the food is very good. It has become our favorite Mexican food spot on the west side."}
{"text":"After such a good write up in the WSJ I was expecting something great! Salsa was runny, the tortillas for the tacos were greasy, and the burrito was bland. No rice and beans were included with the burrito either. I am telling my friends not to bother patronizing this place."}
{"text":"I love love love Gloria's! They have great customer services, my friends and I always go here to have lunch or a quick dinner and get cantaritos that are super amazing! Really recommended!"}
{"text":"Close to my work and edible.  Good and fast service.  Northing to remark on positively or negatively on the food."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was really excited that a \"legitimate\" Mexican restaurant opened within walking distance of my office. Unfortunately that excitement quickly dwindled as my dining experience began. I was greeted quickly and took a seat at the bar since I was dining by myself. 

Shortly after ordering an horchata, they set a half filled basket of chips and maybe 1 oz of salsa. The salsa was OK, but the chips were thick and stale. They would have been better off just serving a back of tostitos. The horchata was not much better. Relatively bland with a gritty mouth feel. If it wasn't for that sandiness I would have swore they bought a box of rice dream and threw some cinnamon in it. 

I was excited to see that carnitas was available in a chimichanga, so that's what I ordered. About 5 minutes later I was given a chimichanga, but after cutting into it, it was clear it was carne asada. I'm glad that's not what I ordered since there was quickly a pool of grease on the plate. I pointed out the mistake and the staff was gracious and apologetic. Shortly after I figured out how the mistake happened. I heard the staff go to the table behind me and ask if they would be ok with a carnitas chimichanga instead of a steak. Clearly they got mixed up in the kitchen. It's OK though, mistakes happen and the other customer ended up raving about the pork. I ended up getting my carnitas chimi about 5 minutes later. Thankfully there wasn't the same kind of pool of grease. In fact, the carnitas was a little dry, but had really good flavor, almost a pork roast flavor to it. The refried beans were run of the mill at best and while tasty, the queso they poured over the chimichanga only served to make it soggy by the time I got to the end of it. The guacamole and Pico de Gallo that accompanied the dish were also nothing remarkable. 

Overall, the food was forgettable and bland. The staff on the otherhand was attentive and outstanding. They alone saved this visit. 

I fully suspect they are much busier than expected, so I'll make another visit in a few weeks to see if things have changed at all. 

Here's hoping."}
{"text":"WOW!! The food is GREAT!!! Never been to a better place before and the cooks are sexy!!!"}
{"text":"Queso with ground chorizo a nice addition to the tortilla chips/salsa starter. Enchiladas de Mole had a kick and was pleasing. Enchiladas Rojas was deliciously spiced with the complimentary Verde sauce. The cell phone controlled jukebox added to the casual dining fun. Our server offered some free songs to get started. Servers were attentive and friendly. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonably priced.  Only complaint is small parking lot!!  Really liked the guacamole!"}
{"text":"I guess I'd say the food is pretty typical, but I'm giving extra points for fast service. Its not the most exciting restaurant but I've always had a good experience. It's close to my work and they are super fast with takeout orders. I've had both the gorditas and enchiladas and both were quite tasty, although the carnitas was more diced pork than shredded."}
{"text":"A nice rather \"americanized\" mexican restaurant in my opinion. By this, I mean some twists that were interesting such as veggie tacos (with cauliflower,etc.) or apparently tamales without meat(which I am definitely going to try next time!). As far as the food itself - I found it rather average compared to more of the authentic flavors on the west side that already exist. The first time I went, it was completely full so did not end up eating there that day(just be aware that it is a small place and fills up quickly from the looks of it!). On the good side, the service is rather fast and attentive so it has that going for it! Because of the interesting menu items, I plan on returning and trying more. What I got was nothing I can really compare to other restaurants as it was so different."}
{"text":"We moved to the Madison Wisconsin area from Colorado and had completely given up hope of ever finding excellent Mexican food here. Then we found our way to Gloria's.  Gloria is an extremely talented chef and everything on the menu is over the top to die for!!  Gloria's specialty menu items are family recipes that are so amazing I wish I could eat there everyday. I highly recommend this restaurant if you love Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place with my wite after reading the reviews. Dang yelpers, you really letter me down on this one. We got there last Friday at around 5:30.  There were 3 other tables of people so we figured it wouldn't be too long of a wait for our food. Ordered and then the wait began. Took close to an hour to get our food! The staff was apologetic enough, apparently they had a big take out order. But seriously, almost walked. When our food arrived, it was nothing special. I had carne asada which was room temperature (you'd think after close to an hour it would be at least warm.)  Flavor was okay, small amount of bland, watery beans and not enough guacamole to even mention.  Wife had beef nachos. Not exactly a traditional Mexican thing, but that's what she wanted. The meat had a weird seasoning which she thought made the whole dish barely palatable. She also got horchata. I gave it a taste and it was super gritty and flavorless. The way I judge a restaurant is that it has to be better than I can make at home.  Gloria's does not pass that test. Too bad, because they were really nice folks."}
{"text":"So impressed! The food was extremely fresh and there were a bunch of good vegetarian options that went beyond the usual standards. The taco with Gloria's pico (which has the delightful addition of cactus to the usual recipe) was really excellent. This is my new favorite casual Mexican restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"My kiddo has never enjoyed a meal at a Mexican restaurant as much as she enjoyed eating here. Her head was bent over the salsa bowl enjoying her chips and salsa that were free. The joy on her face made me so freaking happy! 
The salsa and chips are free - super fresh and mild. We asked for some spicy salsa and our server brought out something green in a condiment bottle with a spout (much like the red ketchup bottles you might see in a diner). I was like \"oh this is gonna be some medium salsa verde type thing\" boy was I wrong. This was a delicious SPICY HOT green goodness salsa. I could pour it on just about any dish. Loved it!! 
Hubby and I split a 16oz lime house margarita on the rocks (just to try it). It was very good. We also ordered a kids quesadilla with rice and beans, vegetarian huarache  and vegetarian enchiladas in mole sauce. The mole sauce was very good. It had a nice smoky flavor and the huarache was filled with veggies and the verde sauce and drizzle of sour cream and fresh avocados really brightened and balanced the dish. 
Reasonably priced, lots of parking and great quick service."}
{"text":"I must first preface this review as someone who's lived as well as traveled to large cities and have had some fantastic authentic Mexican cuisine. I would classify Gloria's is a fine family location and given that it is located in Madison, a fine choice for something other than cheese curds and pub fare. That said, I was a little disappointed in the overall experience there. The basket of chips came half filled, although they did offer us a refill after we quickly finished our share. My carne asada was also a meager serving and the sides could've used some bolstering as well. The tacos al pastor was probably the best part of the meal. I would definitely come back as I would love to see this place succeed, however I hope my next visit will be met with some tweaks of the dishes."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant on the west side!!! Great service and food. Would definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for a pretty authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I had Gloria's veggie tacos and a pepper and cheese tamale--so good! I love vegetarian tacos with cilantro and onion; these did not disappoint--nopales and queso fresco added a depth of flavor (and ingredients you don't often see in MSN). 

My boyfriend got a Michelada and said it was one of the best ones he's had in Madison. They use camaronazo and garnish with Tajin--I tried a sip and also agree it is top notch.

The owner/manager was super friendly, gave suggestions, and checked in to make sure we were happy. 

Plus they had Liga MX on TV--always fun to watch football highlights. 

Nice to have another family owned Mexican restaurant in MSN."}
{"text":"Finally a much-needed mom and pop authentic Mexican restaurant for the West End. Our first visit was great. Friendly staff quick-service and tasty food. I can't wait to explore the menu here. Based on the crowd at noon on a Saturday this place is off to a good start."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to us by a friend so we were excited to try it. What a disappointment. We ordered steak tacos and a steak chimichanga. And horchata to drink. The tacos were $2.50 each so I ordered 3 thinking they would be a decent size... and usually when I order 3 tacos I'm full. Was I ever wrong! The tacos came with like 2 tablespoons of meat and   4 tablespoons of cilantro and maybe 1/2 tsp of onion, if any. It was horrible, it was like eating 2 tortillas with cilantro and occasional pieces of salty meat. The chimichanga was basically the same almost all tortilla with hardly any meat. The horchata was one of the worst I've had. If you are looking for a good Mexican place to eat try Los Gemelos it's a thousand times better than this place and you get your money's worth!!! After leaving Gloria's I was still hungry and upset for wasting my money there. The service was also sub par. Our server was \"ok\" I think she was a teenager who didn't really know what she was doing so I don't want to be too hard on her but she had no personality, I think ordering from a computer would have been more engaging and interesting. I wouldn't waste my time going back to this place even if you paid me. Hopefully they'll improve but if you're planning on trying this place, don't say you haven't been warned. Sorry I should have taken pictures so you could see my cilantro tacos. Lol"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open up. Cheap tacos are one of my most favorite things in life and this place is just a short drive from mi casa. The inside is small but bright and cheery. Service was prompt and friendly (for the most part). Complimentary chips and salsa were delivered to our table quickly. The salsa, while fresh tasting, was nothing special and a bit watery. The chips were a little below average. We ordered the guac as a starter and it again, was just fine. Nothing wrong with it but nothing that made me jump for joy.

The menu is oddly lacking in combination plates. Two of three at our table really wanted a plate with one enchilada and one taco. No problem says the waitress, we can do that. She suggested she order them the enchilada plate which comes with three enchiladas, rice and beans. She said she'd have them do one enchilada, substitute a taco for the other two enchiladas and the dinner would still have rice and beans. Perfect! When the bill came, we had been charged for two full enchilada dinners PLUS two additional tacos. We pointed this out-explaining we had been charged twice for four items (three enchiladas and a taco) when in fact each plate only contained two items. She seemed annoyed by this and did provide a small discount (but it did not make up for the cost so we feel we overpaid).

The food quality was pretty good. Things were fresh and tasty. The corn tortillas were excellent. Overall it wasn't a fantastic experience but it wasn't horrible either. I'm on the fence regarding whether or not I'd be back."}
{"text":"Food was OK. To give you perspective on how premade things are, someone at the table asked for a small margarita and they said they only had big ones (which also cost more). So, none were ordered and food was nothing special."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants on the west side of Madison. The decorations are very nice, there are a lot of tables for many families. The staff also move the tables if someone wants extra room. This restaurant never has a long wait. Great food and exceptional service. Their employees are fast, attentive and friendly. Every time I go here I get a waitress that is very nice and helpful. I usually have a special thing I like to order that is a little different then the menu. 

The staff are happy to accommodate and always willing to suggest something delicious. The food comes out fast, which is super nice. I got a cheese quesadilla, which came with lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. It was such a great meal, simple but delicious. I have gone back many times and will continue to eat here! I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great service with wonderful food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delightfully authentic and overall the food was excellent. My whole family was deeply satisfied with their reasonably priced food, diverse menu, and good atmosphere. Our only complaints were the lack of house maid chips, and a couple dishes could have used a bit of salt. However, this was a wonderful restaurant and I am looking forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"Got some carry out last weekend.  Had a pretty basic meal for two ordered and it look about 30 minutes.  Seemed pretty excessive for tacos.  This is entirely subjective but when I open the chip bag (guac and chips, of course) and I see the green, red, and corn chips....I want to gag.  They are the WORST.  No flavor, always stale, etc.  when that is your first impression, the meal goes downhill pretty fast.  It seems like a few more Mexican places have been springing up so we'll keep trying new ones!"}
{"text":"A nice place for a little lunch, very tasty, but not what I look for in Mexican food. I must add the caveat here that I used to live in Southern CA and literally would go to Mexico for lunch on the weekends. So I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob.

Having said that, the food was good, just not excellent. The place was cute, service was excellent.

The issues I had were that there was little to no spice on the food unless you used their hot sauce, which while adding some extra flavor is not what I would call hot sauce. I got the carne asada, which had some decent flavor but was just a little tough. The highlight for me though was the chips and the corn tortillas which appear to be made in house. As soon as they arrived at the table that aroma of fresh maza surrounded me. That was excellent and they tasted fresh and well seasoned. The salsa to go with the chips was too sweet and a touch bland for me. Over all it was tasty, but it was certainly what I would call gringo Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is a cute little family owned restaurant. If they are super busy the service can get a little slow but I have never seemed to mind because you can tell everyone is doing their best. The nachos are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night with my husband and 2 small children. Only one other table was occupied, so we were seated immediately.

Staff was attentive. Complimentary chips and salsa were brought to our table, and we quickly devoured the first batch. We really liked the salsa - very mild (my 3 year old declared it \"spicy\" but my 18 month old devoured it), pur√©ed and delicious. 

I ordered the steak nachos (tortilla chips, cheese sauce, refried beans, sour cream, steak, lettuce, pico, guac, jalape√±os) - very tasty. My husband ordered a burrito that he enjoyed - he also had the $2 happy hour margarita and was pleased. Older child had the kids nachos (tortilla chips, cheese sauce, ground beef, refried beans, lettuce) and younger child had a chicken quesadilla. Both came with sides of refried beans and Mexican rice. My kids loved their food. 

Great food, great service. The only thing mildly disappointing was the price of the kids' meals - $5.99 each plus an extra 99 cents for a drink. $7 is a tough number for me to pay for each of my kids, so next time I may order them a couple sides or just some chips and guac. But overall, we would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Great place to go for Mexican food! I got the enchiladas verdes and ate every bite. The service was amazing - they weren't too busy when we got there, and we got our food very quickly. It's a small place though and filled up by the time I was leaving (~8 pm)."}
{"text":"Loved the enchiladas de mole. Also, ordered a Jalisco Old Fashioned (ok, I had 2). Food if fresh and authentic. Too good!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty slow to drop the ban hammer on a restaurant, but I don't think we'll be going back here.

We ordered our food after arriving (burrito suizo with carnitas for me, veggie enchiladas de mole for my wife), and things seemed to be going fine.  The food came out reasonably quickly and the chips and salsa were fine in the meantime.

We did have an issues with our order where they informed us that the \"weekends\" section of the menu didn't include Friday nights, only Saturday and Sunday.  The waitress wasn't aware of this, and hashing out that confusion took long enough that we ended up getting our meals a few minutes apart.

My burrito was cold and flavorless.  The tortilla was cold enough that it broke in several spots during the wrapping process.  The ingredients were uninteresting, and the pork was an awkward kind of gray.  I will say that the cheese sauce on top was tasty, and I was hungry enough to eat the burrito, but I wouldn't order it again.

My wife's enchiladas were a different story.  They were also not thoroughy heated and the cheese wasn't melted in them.  Despite requesting vegetarian enchiladas and asking some questions to ensure that's what we were ordering, the plate still came with meat on it.  The waitress eventually came back to check on us and we told her about the situation and explicitly asked her not to bring anything else, just to take it off the bill.  Minutes later, another freshly made dish hit the table, and I feel like they just didn't listen to us when we asked for the situation to be handled a specific way.

I left feeling like the service was inattentive and the one food item out of two that was correctly done was done poorly.  I avoided a one star review because the cheese sauce was decent and the chips and salsa were as well, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We went on Cinco de Mayo and the food was wonderful. Babe had a margarita and some tacos and I had some fried tortillas with chicken in it covered in sour cream. The food was great and even though they were busy they accommodated us."}
{"text":"While visiting my parents last night on the west side we decided to get takeout from Gloria's. After calling it in my dad went to pick it up so I can't speak to the ambiance, but I can give a rundown of the food:

+ Shredded chicken chimichanga: good. Good size, filled with meat, chicken seemed good quality. This is what both my mother and I got. 
+ Enchiladas suizas: I didn't try them because I hate seafood, but my dad thought they were fine. 
+ Rice: standard Mexican rice with peas; not too dry, which was nice. Small portion that filled about half of the designated section in the takeout box. 
+ Beans: runny and so, so salty. Not quite inedibly so, but with my first bite I literally said, \"Hoo! Those are some salty beans!\" When my dad tried his a few minutes later he remarked that I wasn't kidding about them being a salt bomb. Also a small portion coming up about a third of the way of the compartment. 
+ Guacamole: you get a dollop as part of your salad that accompanies the chimis and it had some chunks of avocado; I'd be willing to give it a whirl as an appetizer. 

We also received two containers of green salsa; it's unclear if takeout orders are supposed to come with chips for them (which we did not get) or if the salsa is for the entrees. 

Between the three of us, the overwhelming consensus was \"good but not great.\" As a former westside resident myself I am happy for that neighborhood to have a decent Mexican place, and my parents agree they will likely return to try some other items since it's been so long since having a spot on their side of town. The last one we can remember was located on Mineral Point Road in the strip mall containing Walgreens and Silly Yak. I'd like to dine in at some point and try a few other items as well. Long story short, if I'm over there I'd happily eat there, but I'm not going to drive across town just to do so.

As a side note, the photos on their website are not of their own food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last week and we were hopeful that good Mexican food had finally come to the Westside.  But it wasn't the case.  The margaritas were downright terrible and tasted like they were made with Costco mix and very cheap tequila.  I also noticed that there was no dedicated bartender and the waitresses were making the margaritas.  Perhaps that contributed to the problem?  Once the food arrived, it was bland and uninteresting.  If you can't come for the drinks or the food, then why come at all?"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food with reasonable prices and great customer service. I loved my carnitas and steak tacos. The food is so good my only fear is that they'll run out of seating. It was packed when we were there."}
{"text":"This section of Madison definitely needed an authentic Mexican restaurant and they got it with delicious Gloria's.  We started out with the complementary chips and salsa - the salsa had a slight heat to it, which was perfect.  We tried the chicken mole enchiladas, two tacos (one carnitas, one pastor), a vegetarian gordita and a side of rice/beans.  Everything was well-prepared and flavorful.  I'm going to give the win to either the pastor taco or the enchiladas, but it all was super tasty.  The one thing they're missing (at least in my opinion) is a taco plate.  Ordering each component a la carte brings the price a little higher than most Mexican restaurants.    

The space itself is very bright, cheery and welcoming.  The same goes for the excellent staff!"}
{"text":"the burrito and margarita is fantastic! nice and quick customer service. I now consider this my go to Mexican spot."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Madison. The staff was very polite. They have a good variety of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Great salsa and service. Owner is active and does the little stuff. Means a lot for me. Did not have to wait for new drinks. Fantastic family owned restaurant. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner and margaritas!! Everything was fresh and flavorful! The atmosphere is bright and welcoming too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great new addition to this part of town! Have already been twice since they opened and the food and drinks do not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were thick and from an overly sweet, awful tasting mix. Chimichanga was stuffed with grease. Don't think I'll be back, but the staff was friendly at least."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience. Quiet, quick service. Friendly staff. Will definitively be back as this is our new go to place for drinks. Ask for Ana!"}
{"text":"For the amount and quality of food you get, the price is awesome!! Came here with a big group while on a business trip ... placed opened up not too long ago but was pretty crowded. Staff were wonderful and checked back with us often to make sure we were taken care of. Great food, great price, great staff!"}
{"text":"Small place, DO NOT MISS!!
The margaritas are great, with real fresh lime!
The Carnitas in the tacos are amazing and the tamales are light and fluffy and sooooo tasty!
Definitely a place for the best Mexican in Madison and the best I have had outside of Mexico!"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary about this place, but I also can't find much to complain about.  I love the location, and the food is pretty good. 

To start, the restaurant is clean and colorful.  Very nice atmosphere.  Not a cushy sit-down-and-stay-for-2-hour type of place, but comfortable and welcoming.  The staff was super friendly and genuinely cared that we had a good experience.

The food was good.  I ordered a beef burrito with mole.  They forgot the mole, but that was okay - they brought some out for us.  The mole had a nice spice to it.  Not \"hot\", but a good smolder of flavor to it.  The burrito was a nice portion and had good flavor.  The lady next to us had a chicken burrito with the chicken gravy sauce - it looked excellent.    The chips and salsa were decent.  

Prices were reasonable.  You could go with a combo plate for more, or go a la carte and get exactly what you want.

Ever since Pedro's lost their west side location we've been trying to find an adequate substitute for our Mexican cravings.  This may be the spot.  I look forward to trying more of Gloria's menu to see what items really stand out above the rest!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The food was good but not remarkable. I had the carnitas huarache.  I liked the flavors but there was very little meat.  My partner had the enchiladas mole, which she enjoyed.  It was nice to find this family owned business in  this part of madison/Middleton"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times so far. We love it! I've had the tacos, gorditas and tamales. My favorite thing about this place is that they have tamales every day of the week! Everything I've had has been delicious. I highly recommend Gloria's!"}
{"text":"Was admittedly a bit skeptic to try, but this place is clean, with friendly staff & great food. Was also impressed with the $2.50 house margarita during the Badger game (also available during Packer games). 
We were a walk-in group of 8 but were seated quickly even though the place is small. The manager (perhaps owner) was incredibly friendly & accommodating. My meal was obviously forgotten, but I received it in a very timely fashion and appreciated the manager coming to check on us, to ensure we were happy.
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"While the service was fast, I had more bones in my chimichanga than chicken. Was a bummer because it would of been really good otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is good, we enjoyed our tacos. Having said that, there was nothing that stood out for us. The refried beans are about the runtiest I've come across, however I really like that because it feels more like a bean dip as opposed to actual beans. Some people may not find that appealing. Some people, like myself, might really enjoy it. The real issue with the beans was that they served them on a platter and therefore they quickly became cold. If they had served them in a bowl they would have retained heat a lot longer. I would return if I was in the area. 

Pros: the hot salsa (green) had good flavor and heat while not overly intense. The gorditas were soft with a nice brown sear. The soft corn tortillas were soft and didn't deteriorate when picked up. 

Cons: small place, .50$ up-charge per taco if you prefer flour tortillas, the standard red salsa was basically the consistency of water with a few small pieces of onion, cilantro, pepper, and cilantro. 

This area is not short on Mexican restaurants. They're going to have to do something to differentiate themselves if they want compete in this arena around here."}
{"text":"I have ordered two meals from this place. The carne asada that i ordered for pickup came with a tiny piece of meat, about two spoons of rice and beans. I called this place to speak to the manager. The receptionist said that the manager would get back to me the day after and i never got a call from anyone. I will not recomend this place to anyone nor will i order again. Bad service!!"}
{"text":"First time here- can't believe this place just opened. Food was fresh and delicious-- the service was friendly and attentive. We will be making this a regular stop for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I am usually extremely critical of Mexican food because my mother is Mexican, however, I can say the food here surpassed my expectations! Homemade tortillas were excellent, and shrimp dish was very flavorful. We ordered take-out and everything was as delicious as would be expected in the restaurant. Sopesitos as an appetizer were perfect! My husband ordered the enchiladas verdes, which he loved. We found our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Updating my review after 3 visits to 4 stars. They have consistently gotten better each time. I have still only ordered togo, with 2 young children it's hard to get out.

The rice was more moist and tasted less dry today. The beans were runny like others have said but not super salty. Another traditional Mexican place we like also had runny beans like this so maybe this is how they should be cooked? I've tried the pastor tacos and they are delicious, by far my favorite. My son had the ground beef and seasoned chicken taco, he devoured both. I had a taste of both and they were well seasoned. The chicken is the traditional \"tinga\" they use for tostadas, it's simmered with tomato and adobo chipotle. The tamales also tasted better since the first time, much warmer and flavorful. I asked for chips this time as we did not get any the first 2 times. There is no charge but it's was a fairly small bag with 2 little cups of salsa. The salsa is pretty spicy but fresh tasting. I also had the chilie relleno which was very tasty just wish there was more, portions are still pretty small but for the price I just order extra tacos or tamales. I hope the food continues to impress, it looks like they are working out the kinks, if so I will be back at least for the tacos and tamales alone."}
{"text":"Food was so bland. Small portions. Burrito didnt come with any rice or beans. Salsa was so watery. So was the cheese dip. Service was nice, place was clean but the food just didn't do it."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican food in Madison. They make all of the classics and even some authentic house specials. The service is always prompt and friendly and their Enchaladas Mexicanas are phenomenal. Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We went for the first time last Thursday and we have gone three times since then.   Really great pricing, friendly and fast service, and my picky toddler actually eats their rice.   Their cheese sauce is amazing.   We also enjoyed their hand mixed margaritas.   I will gladly be a regular here."}
{"text":"This dish needs a pic because it is absolutely wonderful.  When I visit Gloria's next time I will take a photo. I highly recommend the shrimp cocktail.  It  is extremely delicious and flavorful. It is loaded with a heavenly mix of perfectly spiced shrimp, tomatoes, onions and cilantro. This is a meal which I could order every visit.  The owners are extremely nice, the staff attentive. This dish is absolutely glorious, or should I say \"Gloria's.\"  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Excellent quality food. Salsa and chip quantity seems to be light.
Great regular margaritas. Will be coming back again."}
