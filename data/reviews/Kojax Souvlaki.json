{"text":"Let me first state just how happy I am Kojax finally re-opened in Laval and to be honest it's better than ever! It used to be the standard fast food fare you'd typically find at any food court but this resto pulled out all the stops to change what they are all about.

First of all this place is gorgeous! The quality of the decor and the look of the establishment was a really nice surprise. Furthermore it's no longer a counter you order from and wait for the food to be prepared. Now they give you a number which you place on your table and the staff bring your food to you when it is ready. This was honestly great as I'd much prefer not have to stand up and wait when there's a rush of patrons waiting on their food. I can go sit down and keep myself busy.

They even have nice TVs and this awesome pop machine with at least 20+ soda options and among them the elusive vanilla coke that makes me so happy to occasionally enjoy. This was totally awesome!!!

I ordered the old fashioned gyro with their house fries with a side sweet sauce... the food was so good!! Some people may think poorly of fast food Greek food but I don't care.... this food is awesome and the value given for about $10 I paid is very high.

All in all this place deserves 5 stars but alas I'll only give them 3. 

When I visited this place for the first time with 2 of my coworkers, the ordering process was a bit difficult. It was pretty clear the cashier was new to the job and having a hard time handling the orders. Kindly note this place opened a few mere days earlier so we were more than understanding of the situation.

But that's not why I dropped 2 stars. The reason why I'm notching 2 stars down is how poorly the manager treated her while in front of clients (specifically us). I fully acknowledge some people simply don't work out at a job but it's quite unacceptable to tell them \"if you cannot work better you can go home right now\" with a nasty tone right in smack of a client paying for an order. The look on the teenage girls face was a mix of shock, anger and fear that made her look like she was about to break down in tears until I left. 

My coworker confronted to manager on a 1 on 1 after we ate and the manager seemed shock that we weren't happy about how he treated her for us and ultimately and savagely responded it won't be a problem in the future since \"she's being let go\".

Firstly that was not our intention to see someone fired and secondly not what we needed to know. Are you that awful?

So in conclusion one of my coworker stated she refuses to come back to this place ever again, another will come back maybe in time (apprehensively) and I find myself conflicted between being a regular patron or following their stand against this place.

Either way I decide it doesn't matter....it won't change the very poor staff management. 

I understand it's new and you want everything to be perfect for your Greek slice of paradise but you left a long loooong impression on us which in turn provided you with your first business review with your shortcomings being the major subject. 

Opa.

Since this review was put up i have come back a few times and received feedback from kojax corporate which is appreciated. This being said, I haven't seen the employee since. Food is good and affordable so I'll occasionally be back."}
{"text":"Les souflakis du Kojax sont pour moi les meilleurs et ceux de cette succursale ne font pas exception. De plus, le restaurant et très propre, décoration simple mais agréable et de bon goût. Malgré que ce soit un fastfood, ils ont pensé au petit détail. 

Contrairement au autre Kojax, on ne voit pas les cuisiniers préparer les plats devant nous.

Les caissières sont courtoises."}
