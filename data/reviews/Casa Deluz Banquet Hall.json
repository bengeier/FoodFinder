{"text":"My relative just had wedding here! Horrible! Bad service...bad food.. Not worth it for $1100 per table not including drinks or tips. We were missing 3 dishes in the course. When we confronted the waitress, she looked at the other n smirked... Well reliability gone there!!!
Food was horrible! If u had shark fin soup, tasted like soy sauce.... I suggest u go to pacific mall second floor to food court get their \"street style shark fin soup\" for 3 bucks, it's 10 times better! The fried rice and noodles were tasteless.. No salt... And red bean dessert... No sugar... I suck at chinese cooking and I could tell u all, my cooking is better than them. So if you all had weddings planned there.... Well goodluck......"}

{"text":"Casa Deluz has good dimsum, HOWEVER! The service is a chaos. Manager please pay attention to the service, if not enough people, hire more before you piss off more customers. I called to book a reservation on Saturday, reception told me they don't take reservation before 11:30am, so I was ok to set reservation at 11:30am for 14 people. Then one of my family members came in early, 11:20am and told them that we were here for the 14 people table... guess what... we didn't get our table until 12:15pm... now 45 minutes to wait for a table that you reserved is a FUCKED UP system. People have a business to take care of and we do not have 45 minutes to wait for your pathetic reservation system. if you don't take reservation, THEN DON'T TAKE IT AND THEN FUCKED US UP LIKE THAT!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best dimsum, but ok. Lots of people come here for their \"early bird\". Before 11 all servings are the same price (no differentiation between L M and S). And if you have their VIP card, you get what might possibly be the least VIP offer ever: 50 cents off the $1 tea service charge (but we'll take what we can get).  

Overall the decor and cleanliness is good, but service and food are lacking. The menu does not list the number of items per serving, which is standard in other dim sum restaurants and makes order planning difficult. Serving order (the timing of dishes and time between dishes) was kind of a mess. The staff seems to not care about these details. Dessert was served to an completely empty table that had clearly not started the mains yet (turns out we didn't even order it). The second plate of one dish came way later than the first plate (most places would serve multiples of the same dish together), and showed up along with the dessert plates. Service was somewhat surly with a side of attitude. We got an eyeroll for asking some questions about a particular dish. They're not using large enough steamers for some of their dumplings.  The dumplings are placed too close causing the wrappers stick during cooking and rip when you try to pick them up later. Had a couple of sad xiao long bao rips that let out all the tasty soup inside. 

None of the dimsum dishes were stellar, just ok. The only star was the mango pudding at the end, which I thought was very prettily plated as two swimming fish and tasted great."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed. I went with my father and ordered five dishes. The only flavourful dish was the mango purple rice mochi dessert, but honestly I find the portion too small for a medium dish. (They're four tiny bites on a big dish that they drizzled with mango sauce.) 

Their fried squid tentacles needed more seasoning. It's nice that they grilled it, but it was pretty bland. We also ordered the pan fried sampler which had one pan fried turnip cake, one walnut cake, and one taro cake. We can tell it was reheated because it was hard and dried out. It also didn't have enough turnip/taro in it. The other dishes all suffered from the same problem in that it was either reheated or lacked seasoning. 

My guess is that if we had gone before 11 AM, then the food would have tasted slightly better since they would have had more people and thus, we wouldn't have been served reheated dim sum. But for the price we paid, we could have gone somewhere with better food and had money left over. Honestly I would not go here unless it's before 11 AM when it's cheaper and there's enough customers for them to serve something more fresh.

Also my spoon had dried food on it. Not a big deal in that I got another spoon. It's just weird to be in a place so lavishly decorated, but to be given dirty utensils."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant that you want to eat there or taking your friends or business assoicates. 
Services is a disaster. They tried to cook food and pated them to imitate better class restaurant. 
We ordered a good number of dishes for a table of 9 people, the dishes all came out at once and they have to stack the dishes on top of others even on the tea pot.
Speaking to the manager nicely like talking to the wall. All excuses but not action. They offered a 10% discounta and think that was a bigh deal.
With the high price that they charging, the customers who came here would not care about a 10% discount. It was an insult for a license to give poor services and low quality food.
Poor mangament, poor serice and not good food.
I would not recommend this for all occasion.

don't wast your money and time."}
{"text":"Third restaurant to try their hand in this Woodside Sq location.  Ordered the usual suspects for Dim Sum.  Rice Roll Shrimp.. ummm the Shrimp were only half cooked.  Lean pork and egg congee... whys the pork bright pink?  Deep fried items were beyond greasy.  

Desserts were sad.. to top it off there was a dead fly on the strawberry jelly dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum and there was nothing exceptional about it.  Had the taro cake and it was salty just like every other dish we ordered.   The only thing nice about this restaurant is there automated paper towel dispenser in the men's washroom.  You can get dimsum elsewhere for better value.   Not high end at all."}
{"text":"The worst, waited 45 mins to an hour to get seated,  they only prefer larger groups. Literally seen two groups of 10 people, mind you our party is a party of 6, skip the line and get seated. You get a number but what's the point when you get overlooked by a bigger group. Prices also increase after 1055, from 3.30 a plate to 4-8$ a plate depending what you order. Don't bother if you're planning to go on a weekend, you'll probably have to wait hours to be seated or acknowledged."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times for dim sum and a couple times for dinner. The large seating area, the upscale furnishings, the clean chinaware, and the unique dishes are just a few things that keep me coming back. Despite the large seating area, there is usually a wait for a table during dim sum hours on a weekend. The good thing is that there is a mall connected to the restaurant, so you can take a walk in the mall while one person in the party waits for the table. 

In my most recent dim sum visit, I discovered that they have a special menu with high end items you typically don't see at other dim sum restaurants. I knew I had to try something from this menu. We ordered the Dim Sum Platter which consisted of a Foie Gras and Shrimp Dumpling, a Steamed Shrimp Dumpling, a Guilin Shark Fin's Dumpling, a Steamed Dumpling in Chiu Chow Style, a Steamed Perigord Black Truffle Siu Mai, a Steamed Dumpling with Mixed Mushrooms and Snow Pea Leaves, and a Steamed Beef Dumpling. It's meant to be a sampler, so I would recommend you order more than one platter if you want to try multiple dumplings. All of the dumplings were on the larger side and were very juicy and flavourful! If I had to pick a favourite, I would pick the Guilin Shark Fin's Dumpling. I tried the Foie Gras and Shrimp dumpling at another restaurant and it tasted the same, so it wasn't as special (but still good), and I'm not a huge fan of truffle, but I thought the truffle paired well with the siu mai.  

For dinner, they usually aren't too busy. The food is still good, but the menu items are on the pricier side, so I think that drives some people away. Both times I came for dinner, I had a coupon, so I thought it was worth the price we paid. The best thing about dinner is the complimentary dessert they serve. In my most recent visit, they served us a purple rice soup, taro jello and almond cookies.

Overall, this is an average to above average Scarborough restaurant, and you pay the price for it. On the upside, you can get a VIP card to get 10% off your bill and a discounted tea per person charge (this cannot be applied on top of the early bird dim sum discount). Watch out for the mandatory 10% service charge on your bill!"}
{"text":"Service was really horrendous,  it took an hour for the food to arrive. The vegetables were rotting and the pork was mostly pink. This restaurant has some serious efficiency issues, and the food was absolutely bombarded with MSG.

Do not recommend. At all."}
{"text":"It took an hour to get the table. We almost left; I mean, the prices are horrific for dim sum, and the service is just awful.

This restaurant/banquet hall isn't anything special; the atmosphere is nice I guess, it's probably what you're paying for anyway. 

The food is \"okay.\" It isn't anything great or superb - the pork buns we had weren't even hot. Luke-warm at best... 

Overall, I don't recommend this restaurant - apart from if you want to go to somewhere with decent atmosphere. 2/5 stars rating."}
{"text":"This is a very big restaurant with cloth covered tables, carpeted floor, and chandeliers, it's also clean and bright. 

We went there on Chinese New Year; thinking that the dim sum size: S, M, L are all the same price if ordered by 10:55am. However, I completely missed the find print that the special pricing doesn't apply to CNY, any western holiday, or long weekend! So our bill came up to about $85 for 10 dishes. 

The food was fresh and in a decent size, service was the norm for Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"First time checking it out, and I'm pretty impressed. The decor is a little gaudy with marble everywhere and rows of bright chandeliers, but I guess I prefer it to the usual dust and grime in most establishments. Waitstaff are dressed in clean and neat uniforms, a pleasant change compared to the usual dirty white aprons of most places.

Dim sum is indeed $2.80 for all sizes before 11AM. Some highlights:

- #30 BBQ pork pastry: light and flaky bite sized pastries. The BBQ pork inside was not brightly colored red! A pleasant surprise.

- #35 Rice roll with minced beef: a dim sum staple, but the soy sauce was left with you in a tiny jug in case you wanted more sauce. The soy sauce was also pre-warmed! Impressive attention to detail.

- #20 Baked chicken pie with abalone sauce: I'm not really a chicken pie fan; the stuff you'd find in regular Chinese bakeries kind of sucks. But it's really tasty here. Almost ordered another one of these!

- #44 Mango mochi roll: sweet and full of mango flavor with a very nice presentation. The kids will love this one.

- #2 Shrimp dumpling with foie gras: not a foie gras fan (for taste + ethical reasons), but the dumplings were huge and bursting with shrimps. The foie gras is minimal, which I'm okay with.

Service was very decent. Waitstaff served the dishes with a \"Jo sun!\" And a smile. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Dim sum is okay, the experience was horrible. We arrived early but the staff still let people in through the \"back door\", regardless of when they arrived."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant on a number of occasions including dim sum, set banquet dinner and regular dinner.  On all visits the staff is very attentive and friendly. Food is delicious and prices are reasonable.  

Dim sum -very intracutly made small dishes that have been maticulasly put together.  Dumplings are great, rice rolls are also very delicate and rice to meat ratio is perfect.  Steamed dishes are cooked to perfection and overall food is flavored well. Prices are a little higher than average dim sum joints it's justified for the ambiance and table ware (no plastic table covers here).

Banquet style dinner -was about $600 for a table of 10 which included lobster,  fish, and a number of other dishes. The staff was very cordial to us and attentive.   Every dish was presented to us and staff members scooped the food to our plates (practically getting white glove service).

Regular dinner -we still opted for the set dinner (pecking duck and a number of other veggie and meat dishes) is about $80 for a table of 4. Portions are normal. Service is good and the food is still on par with any top chinese restaurant in the gta.

My family members also really enjoy this place.  If we ever have spacial requests the staff is willing to do their best to help.  Very professional service and authentic food, decor is modern and overall it's a great chinese restaurant to take any visiting guests."}
{"text":"First things first, the interior of this place is huge. Also, it is very nicely decorated, very bright and clean. We got in around 10 am on a weekday for dim sum, and had to wait around 15 minutes for a table (it was packed).  

The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered it. Not only was the food pretty good, the price was on point as well (small, med, and large dishes are all $3.30 each if ordered before 11 am). However, the food wasn't too special EXCEPT for the honey cakes (see picture). The honey cake was by far my favourite item on their menu, perfect texture, taste and aroma. I recommend trying it if you decide to go here.

The service was pretty good for a dim sum place. All the servers seemed really busy, but they ensured that our tea and water was adequately filled periodically. 

Overall, this is a pretty good, well rounded, dim sum place. Try the honey cake. ;)"}
{"text":"Great new Chinese restaurant addition in Scarborough. I love how they decorated the restaurant with many chandeliers. Dim sum is not bad, I would go there again."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for dim sum! If you come here before 11 am, dim sum is a tad cheaper, but you don't get to order the specials. It's still a bit expensive for dim sum, but it's pretty good. The size of some of these items are outrageous-- I seriously think that if you were to dim sum here, you need to be in a big group to get a huge variety of items and still finish it. Come early to ensure you get a seat! It's a pretty big place, but it also gets pretty crowded at times.

My favorite dim sum dish from here is the honey spare ribs!! SO GOOD AND I CAN EAT PLATES AND PLATES OF IT."}
{"text":"One of the BEST dim sum places in Toronto! There is tons of parking and the food is delicious. I personally prefer ordering from a sheet instead of the old school way of pushing a cart around. 

Pros
Actually honours the early bird special $3.50 for ALL dishes. 

Cons
VERY BUSY on Sundays, minimum 30 min wait. 
They still charge $1.50 for tea even if you don't drink any tea which should be illegal. I requested no tea and they would not remove the tea charge. 
Early bird special does not apply on long weekends and holidays. 

Protip - Their website says they open at 9:30am which is incorrect, they usually open at 8am. MUST arrive before 9:30am to avoid the line. 

Damage $38 after tax pre-tip."}
{"text":"It's been a tradition coming here when we visit Toronto. This Dim Sum and traditional Chinese banquet hall is grand in size and offerings. From the looks of it, I'll assume this place can comfortably seat 500-600 people. From a casual dim sum day to private room family dinners, Casa De Luz caters well. One expectation anyone should have coming in Is the level of service. Lets face it, they're goal is to get your food as fast as possible and take clear directions. Asking for opinions, would more likely annoy them unless you're planning a fancy private dinner. If you want no frills, fresh dim sum this is a must. This place makes you imagine how it's like in the kitchen when it's packed with patrons. So yes, be realistic with expectations, be direct, loudly call out the servers as they probably have 10 to-dos's at any given moment and I can guarantee you'll have a real semi-chaotic dim sum experience."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be s fine Chinese restaurant but the food was subpar.

We were in a private room. The service was okay. The set menu included some fancy items such as abalone, shark fin soup, lobsters, bbq baby pig, scallops etc. But couldn't really taste the flavor of the ingredients. Could only taste the soy source from the lobster and it was a bit too oily. The steamed fish was probably the best item of the dinner.

We had many courses and the portion was big but none of them was executed well. A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in on weekday and surprisingly restaurant was quite busy but no waiting hehehe. Ordered foods directly no rolling cart, that's fine with me. I had chicken feet pork dumpling shrimp fresh rolls beef tripe  deep fried octopus etc.. too many lol  Foods are fresh ... good quality. ..good portion and tasty.  Service pretty good. ..overall I had a good time and will come back."}
{"text":"Wow, this was interesting.  Quite honestly the food here is not bad, big place and okay service.  However, we came here on Chinese New Year and they had some guy dressed as the god of fortune coming around to collect red pockets from us.  Their god of fortune actually came up to our table and put us on the spot.  I guess they figured that we won't decline giving red pockets because we want to look generous in front of our friends and relatives.  What a douche move...lol... It was funny because we knew what they were doing but we didn't give in.

So I give you 2 stars in a red pocket for trying to pull that on us... Hope it gives you good fortune :)"}
{"text":"First time here.  We were here for dinner and we ordered their Chinese new year special. I don't even know if there's an equivalent in English...it is a bit like hot pot.

The staff were professionally attired and offered great service without being in your face all the time.  

The new years dish is a pot filled to the brim with food that's already cooked and seasined- chicken, duck, fish balls, taro, seaweed, scallops, oysters, etc and lots of vegetables and tofu. It came on a portable stove top and the staff poured some broth in and started to heat it up.  We were told that the food were already cooked, we just have to wait till the soup boil to warm up the food then we can eat...

Boy did that process take a long time! We were very hungry and because the pot was so full you couldn't really stir it to get the bottom bits so we had to take from the top, which were still kinda cold. Some of it taste okay cold, like the duck and chicken, but some of it I wish I had waited till they were warmed enough  (like the taro and the fishballs)

This one dish was big enough for more than 5 ppl and we had a lot of left overs. I don't particularly like what we ordered tonight but I'd be interested to try other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"This place is always packed for dim sum. One of the fancier dim sum restaurants in Markham. This place is gorgeous and spacious which is ideal for weddings and special occasions. They really try to differentiate themselves from other dim sum restaurant with their food offerings. I'm impressed with their menu items (more so cuz they offer two types of egg tarts!) 

Pricing can be a bit higher than normal, but is reasonable when you're paying for quality, cleanliness, comfort, innovative dishes and attentive service."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with amazing eats. You can get some lobster by the pound and they'll cook it extemely tender, stir-fry method. The Peking duck was thin and crispy, wrapped not with thin tortilla but with a thicker style bun; rather interesting. The veggies were done really well, including a really nice mushroom with peapod leaf dish. The beef and sweet and sour pork were also nicely put together, tenderized meet with delicate fried dough around the pork. 

Decor inside space was nice, with chandeliers and cloth all around. Funny, there was clearly a wedding banquet with the couple's name at the front of the hall emblazoned in purple letters. Not sure if they left the couple's names from the previous weekend, or was preparing for the following weekend, or just wanted to telegraph to everyone that they were available for wedding banquets!

All in all, super impressive."}
{"text":"We came here for a large family dinner for Mother's Day. I hadn't been here for a number of years. It's been nicely renovated and upgraded. That night decorated probably from a wedding the previous day. We ordered a set menu for 8 people. Food came out too fast and everything was pushed out and rushed. You feel rushed eating on the beginning but then the service dwindled near the end of the meal. Portions were big. Food tasted good and presented nicely. They charged tip automatically. Service was friendly enough. Washrooms were tidy and there's one at each end of the restaurant. It's a big restaurant. I would come back and try dim sum."}
{"text":"Worst place for dimsum. The wait is ridiculous! I've never waited over 1 hour for mediocre dimsum . You ask the lady how long it may be and her instant answer was \"I don't know!\" like your question is annoying. I can tell you if I knew it was 1 hr wait... I wouldn't be waiting. The quality isn't special compared to the local dimsum nearby. Price is not worth it after 11am. Actually the front lady played favoritism...they left empty tables inside for their favourite /regular guest even if they just arrive..while you waited 1+hr. I had to confront the lady or else they would sneak in their regular customers. That's not fair! Tips is included in their bill regardless if you like it or not. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"After what was presumably the worst dim sum experience I had in recent memory last weekend, I came to Casa Deluz for dim sum determined, looking for redemption. The verdict? I left quite satisfied and happy about the overall experience. Part of me isn't so sure how much of that is because of the previous experience, but Casa Deluz offers some good dim sum.

The banquet hall is large, the décor is nice, and the room is brightly lit. First impressions were extremely pleasant as even with the massive amount of people waiting in the large lobby (bonus points for not being sardines and not having to make people wait outside!), We only had to wait 20 minutes which we spent browsing Woodside Square. When we came back, it was past our number and they were still able to accommodate us with a table instantly. Perfect! 

We ordered a pretty standard set of dim sum items and all were more or less decent. There's not much to say about it, everything was good and we enjoyed all the items. The food was hot and fresh and most of the items were tender. 

Service was excellent here as there were many servers even despite our table being somewhat in the back. 

Pricing could have been a bit more affordable considering the portion sizes of some of the items.  The total bill came out to be $80 for 4 people. But considering everything and the polished service, it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"On a Sunday morning we waited for over 90 minutes for dim sum. Lolly gaggers at some tables clearly finished eating but sat there occupying their tables while lots and lots of people waiting. Once seated, order by paper not old school push carts. Food came at a good pace and all hot and fresh. Loved the big shui mai and har gow. Beef meatballs were dense and fully cooked unlike some other places the meat wasn't fully cooked. Beef rice rolls and shrimp rice rolls were simply delicious. Pork buns were just light and fluffy. Becareful as service charge/tip included on bill."}
{"text":"Everything here tastes good. They have a couple of dim sums that are unique to this place. One of them is foie gras har gow. Comes in four big pieces. I liked their deep fried taro with pork stuff inside but wish it was a bit more seasoned. My favorite dim sum here is a crispy squid. So crispy and well seasoned. I prefer this place over other dim sum places simply because food taste better. Super busy on the weekend (be prepared to wait in the line) and poor service (lack of staff to take care of tables...) 

Regardless of poor service and long lineups, I would come back here to fix a dim sum craving."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner with family since it was kind of the middle point for everybody. I wasn't really expecting that much either because I've been to so many Chinese restaurants they all kind mesh together. However, my experience at Casa Deluz was so bad I had to write a yelp review just to warn others. I saw the reviews and most of them were about their dim sum so maybe their service during busy hours are better.

My family decided to choose their preset banquet menu of about $500ish. I was in a party of 13 people so it just made sense to get a bunch of plates. We order banquet style a lot when we go out or are in a party. The first dish is always a cold dish, then theres veggie dishes, soup, chicken, dish, steak, rice, noodles, ect. I think we had about 13 plates in all. We ordered before everyone else got here because we didn't want to leave too late since we had to drive back to NY the next day. The first dish which is a cold dish so theres barely any cooking involved took 30 minutes to come out... The waiters even asked us if we ordered and we said yes, you guys placed it in already... I had to keep asking for water repeatedly because they would always forget. I'm pretty sure I had to ask 3x every time I finished my water. I was also in a group of 13 people and they gave us only 2 tea pots... Do you know how much tea asian people drink? They were constantly forgetting to fill our teapot. 

The place was not even crowded. They had 3 or 4 other parties with them while they had about 8 waiters. It doesn't make sense for service to be so slow. I basically saw the staff just having a conversation when we clearly needed so much going on. The food was fine nothing to brag about. It tasted like all the other banquet dinners I have had just with terrible service. Usually during the course of the meal they would change your plates 2 or 3 times and that's just expected. You shouldn't have to ask for it. We had to ask someone and then they realized that they should change all the plates. Not to mention when we got our final dishes of noodles and rice we are suppose to receive a dessert soup and some sweet stuff. They never gave us dessert we were just sitting there waiting. When we asked for the dessert they said they would bring it out... They forgot. 15 minutes went by and we had to ask for it again. 

When the bill came they added gratuity already. That's fine because they usually add it when theres a larger party but this service was so bad we had to say something. The manager didn't do anything he tried to blame other waiters. The least he could have done was take a percentage off. Instead he gave us old mooncakes. I don't even like mooncakes but we weren't going to get anything else. Terrible service, mediocre food, and they don't even do anything to fix the situation. Worst birthday dinner ever.

Casa Deluz, more like Casa Delousy or Casa Deloser."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant's dim sum is probably the worst around. It really is such a shame because the restaurant itself is renovated quite nicely and the presentation of the food itself actually isn't bad. 

When I came here with my family for dim sum we were actually expecting to be waiting a while since it was just past 11:00 on a weekend. However, we were seated in about 10 minutes.

The dim sum selection here is actually a decent size. They also have a special where all S/M/L dim sum are $3 if you order before 10:55. 

The service here wasn't too bad. It is what you expect at a Chinese restaurant. It was hard to get the attention of a waiter but our food did come rather quickly after we ordered. 

As other yelpers have mentioned, they do add a service charge on the bill. This service charge is probably overlooked by many customers who only look at the final total and thus resulting in over tipping. They really should tell you about this service charge or remove it and let customers tip whatever they want."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????9???????????????????????????????????????ok?????????????????????"}
{"text":"Dim sum was actually quite tasty. Unfortunately we came on the long weekend and the early bird prices were not in effect. Which is $3.20 per dish small, medium, large only.

Dim sum was not overly salty or have MSG. It was fresh and hot.

Beware: 

Tea charge per person is $1.
Service fees are added to the bill. So DO NOT TIP 

Service was okay. It wasn't great considering what you would pay for the dim sum that almost costs an arm and a leg for the jumbo and special (SP) on the menu. 

Decor is nice. Restaurant is big.

But maybe I would come again with the early bird special. Not everyone is rich enough to throw money at dim sum when I can eat other things for cheaper."}
{"text":"What can I say? For someone lives in Mississauga, this place is good enough for dim sum. The services are fast. Servers are polite. Food is delicious. My favourite is that brown sugar cake looks like a bee honey comb, it's chewy and really tasty."}
{"text":"Food's ok, a bit pricy, and service was so-so. Had to ask a waiter to follow up on two dim sum orders."}
{"text":"Great dim sum! The place is pretty cheap before 11am but it gets pretty packed as everyone tries to get their dim sum sheet into the system before the 11am cut off. Waiting times for a table can reach to 40 minutes to a hour on busy holidays. Overall the food is great, it's not very salty either, not oily and minimal msg. The place is also very clean."}
{"text":"We went there for dim sum on Saturday around 1pm and it was still busy - waited for around 15 minutes before we got seated. The place was well lit, but the floors were a bit dirty.

We ordered the following:
Supreme Congee (Pork Liver) - $7.99 
(Not recommended - Salty for my own taste, but not bad)

(Imitation) Shark Fin Dumpling - $7.50 
(Not recommended - You can get this in other dim sum places for a cheaper price)

Foie Gras Shrimp Dumpling - $6.50 
(Recommended - Unique, just a hint of foie gras and lots of shrimp, - try at least once)
 
Shanghai Pork Dumpling (Xiao Long Bao) - $6.50 
(Not recommended - dry and tasted really sweet?)

Beef Ribs with Sesame and Honey - $5.50 
(Recommended - pretty sweet and fall off the bone ribs)

Rice Roll with Fried Dough - $4.80 
(Not Recommended - Fried dough was not fresh)

Chiu Chow Dumpling - $3.80 
(Recommended - lots of filling and the skin was thin)

Deep Fried Taro Dumpling - $3.80 
(Over fried causing it to be bitter, but the taro tasted fresh) 

Deep Fried Pumpkin with Preserved Eggs
(Not recommend, we sent it back because it was the pumpkin was bitter and did not pair well with the preserved eggs)

Tea - $1.00/person

Overall, this is an overpriced restaurant for dim sum but they have some unique dishes that I would recommend trying at least once."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. The menu was all vegetarian since the guest of honor was obviously vegetarian duh. There was a total of 12-14 dishes. No really stand out dishes except that lotus leaf rice near the end of the meal. Waiters were very fun and outgoing, note if you want pop there is a charge for it which was utterly stupid but whatever. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location since it became Casa Deluz. Wow! It seems a lot brighter and more upscale than the previous establishment. Good start.

We had a group of eight for early dim sum. Apparently, there's an early bird special before 11:00am. Like most dim sum restaurants these days, you fill in the quantities on a menu card. I miss the days of the carts being pushed around so you can see what's available. After all, don't we eat with our eyes first?

The food started arriving quickly and the portions were huge! Every dish, every dumpling, was larger than all the dim sum places I've been to in recent memory. It looked good. Unfortunately, some of the dishes were overcooked and/or bland. The siu mai was probably the biggest I've ever seen. Because of the larger portions, it turns out that we ordered too much food. Leftovers!

Even with the early bird specials, it was pricey. Splitting the bill worked out to around $22.00 per person, about double what I'm used to paying. The service and ambiance were very good. The portions were noticeably larger than average but the flavour and pricing could have been better."}
{"text":"I've been here on a number of occasions, including dim sum and dinner. The hall is beautifully decorated, with very nice lighting, and when you walk inside you feel like you walked into a banquet hall. 

Service is great usually, they do make sure you always have clean plates, and refill your tea, etc. Their dim sum is pretty cheap if you go early (before 11am) and there is a large variety and in general all their dishes taste pretty good. Love their ha gau and siu mai!! they also have this mango sticky rice thing that is so good too. But in general, their buns, as well as their tripe, beef balls, everything is really great. I've taken my non-Chinese coworkers here for dim sum (they came all the way from Durham region lol) and they had an amazing time and loved all the food!

I came here for dinner recently - it was my first time as I've never eaten there before aside from dim sum. We spoke with one of the staff, who gave us pretty good recommendations on a few dishes that we could try, and I must admit, all the dishes were cooked very nicely, great taste, though they are on the pricier side, I feel that  you get what you pay for (if you want better quality food, it comes at a price). 

Soya sauce chicken is AMAZING. The chicken was super smooth, moist, and the soy taste was not overpowering the chicken. 
We ordered this dish that had a variety of greens, including zucchini, lotus, celery, parsnip(?) stir-fried. it was delicious! the ingredients are fresh, and it wasn't too oily for a stir-fry.
For those who love seafood, their honey fried oysters are wonderful! The texture was nice and crisp, full of the honey flavour, and the oysters were HUGE! Definitely a delight to eat :)

Next time I would like to try their lobster and their peking duck (they do have some dinner specials)!"}
{"text":"We came for dim sum on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm, well past the early bird special time.  I don't remember what we ordered in totality, but I distinctly remember that 1) the food tasted delicious and 2) the portion was big.  For example, the Stir Fried Rice Noodle with Deep Fried Garlic ($7.50 on dim sum menu) was the size of a full entree.  There was no \"dim sum\" portion going on for this order.  Granted there was not much of meat in the ingredients, but the color and the taste were good.  The Shao Mei ($4.80) were big, delicious and there were 4 pieces in the order.  Many restaurants give you 3 pieces nowadays.  One item that impressed all of us was the Pan Fried Taro Cake ($2.80).  It tasted so rich of taro and the texture was so smooth.  

One note is that beware of over-ordering, as the portion here is bigger than many lower priced restaurants.

For reference, I would put the dim sum at Casa Deluz on par with the traditional dim sum at Shangri-La Banquet Hall in Markham.  Shangri-La features some innovative dim sum, whereas Casa Deluz offers traditional flairs.  

Another thing that stood out - the tea was very good.  I looked; the pot was loaded with whole Jasmine tea leaves, not chopped up tiny tea leaves bits.

The services were good during our visit.  This might be because the early bird crowd was gone.

We will likely return for dim sum if we are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Restaurant was highly disorganized, multiple staff checking on the same table asking the same questions. Stopped serving food halfway through the 10 people combo, and waited for at least 40-45 min for the dinner to continue. Multiple staff asked for us to pick between rice or noodle even though we're supposed to get both. Worst service ever, and was stuck at the restaurant waiting for food to come for almost 4 hours. Overall a terrible restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and had dinner with about 10 people on a Sunday night. It's a nicely western decorated Chinese Fine Dining restaurant located in Scarborough (McCowan & Finch). 

Service was on point and very attentive. They would regularly replace your plate to ensure you have a clean plate with every dish. Tea was replenished on a regular basis without asking. I'm assuming service was good because it wasn't a busy night.

Food was good and presentation was acceptable. Nothing really stood out as outstanding. If anything, the prices are a little higher than your average Chinese restaurant. I guess you're really paying for the nice decor and ambience.  

Overall the experience was satisfactory as nothing was really bad and nothing was really amazing. Would I go again...yes, if I'm in the neighbourhood and I want to fork out a little more $ OR maybe to take some out-of-town guests to a nicely decorated Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Decently priced for the food. You check off menu items and they bring it out from there kitchen in a matter of minutes. 

The chestnut dessert is really fragrant and delicious. Try it! There's the pan-fried 3 kinds of cake that gets you the taro, turnip and chestnut cakes. 

The tip is included in the final bill."}
{"text":"I decided to come here since it was close to my mom's place and our regular place shut down. I had read other yelp reviews before I came and found a few things true. They let in regulars ahead of you! I waited there in line and the hostess let in 3 families that was behind me and didn't even acknowledge me! I had to stop her and get a number or else she probably would have continued to ignore me. When we sat down, the servers were pretty nice though. 

The prices for dim sum however was pretty pricey. $3.20 for small and most regular dim sum items were listed as M or L ($5.20). I will give some points for the taste and quantity of the food. The portions are bigger than most dim sum restaurants and the quality is decent. The sui mai dumplings are double the size, the egg tarts are nice and flaky, the beef ribs were crispy and sweet, taro cakes comes in 3 large pieces, and the other items we ordered were pretty standard. We ordered a total of 8 items and the bill was $50 - service charge included. 
 
The restaurant itself is spacious and decorated to look more upscale I suppose. The paper for ordering the dim sum is thick (maybe that's why they charge so much for their food!) and confusing. The descriptions for the items were so odd I had to decipher what I was ordering. 

Overall I found the food tasty, my sister thought it was \"meh\". I will not be coming back here due to the high prices and favoritism towards \"VIPS\". There are better restaurants with similar qualities... just gotta make a further trek next time."}
{"text":"Very large and open restaurant. Service was excellent. Early bird special is before 10:55am and we put in our order just after 11am but the waiter still got us the early bird special pricing.The food came out very fast almost like our orders were prepared in advance. Food was pretty average though. Nothing really stood out as being very good. The two items that I really liked were the chicken pot pie and the shrimp rice roll.

Its a very decent dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for morning tea. First off, waiting for a table: Cathy, a lady in a blazer and red shirt, allows certain guests cut the line. I came in and there were 6 parties ahead of me. An hour later, there were still 3 in front of me... That's ridiculous because more than 3 tables opened during the hour. It was blood boiling to watch the line cutters. They would come in and stand on the peripherals, and Cathy would \"discreetly\" bring them to an empty table. I saw this happen at least 9 times. I overheard people complaining to the manager, George, after witnessing what was happening, and he simply did not care. I get that restaurants do this for VIPs, but Casa Deluz's unashamed and rude attitude of pushing aside normal guests is disgusting. This completely ruined my mood. 

Food: average. A bunch of regular dim sum dishes are listed as extra large or special. Those prices are ridiculous. The taro pastry lacked flavour. Pan fried lotus cake was interesting; I don't think I've seen it at other restaurants. The fried salty dumpling was really bad (no fillings and they added lots of corn...). I feel that their dim sum is a hit or miss. 

Service: slow and inattentive. Bringing tea to my table took 15 minutes. At dim sum restaurants, that should've happened as soon as the hostess left our table. Otherwise, the service was average... for a dim sum restaurant. 

Beware: Their bills already include an 11% tip, but they never tell you. I find the principle behind this action to be despicable.

Overall, I will not be back. The wait and the service charge effectively convinced me that the food is not worth it. I'd rather go to Shangri La for morning tea."}
{"text":"Casa Deluz: 0.5/5

The good: lots of tables but...

The bad: the food isn't great, in fact there are much much better dim sum places than this. The presentation was fine, just the taste isn't good. However...

The ugly: referring back to the loads of table, there are also tons of people (they have a weekend dim sum promotion, where dishes are all at a discounted price). That of course attracts customers. However, in order to get a table it comes at a no reservation and first come first serve basis. Unfortunately, I got to see customers cut in the line without having to wait. They all go to one of the assistant mangers, bypassing the wait table, and getting a table right away. The worst case I've seen was one customer going directly to an empty table and dragging one of their 'assistant' managers to the table in order to pretend they were the ones who put them there. Confronting the manger did nothing more than rolling their eyes and telling us that no such thing happened. What was more of a 30-45 min wait was suddenly an hour and more wait. I can tolerate a few 'vip' customers cutting, but when it gets to 8-10 tables being cut in front of you, you start wondering how this no reservation system works.

The terrible: I would have love to no tip them (I never ever have done this at a restaurant), but you won't even get that choice. All bills are cash only, and 'service charge' are already included. 

The neutral: I only gave them 0.5/5 just because their dim sum was average and edible."}
{"text":"really like their chinese food here, its definitely one of the tops in toronto. they have live seafood available and its in a banquet hall like place which is really nice. perfect place to host a chinese dinner for party guests you wish to impress. they have really nice plating skills for their food as well. you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you have all the time in the world to wait. Horrible service. Not even a full house. Waited over 30 minutes and we don't even get our soup. Will never come back. The food are also super salty and overcook. I would give zero star if I could.

I've never written any reviews but really want to let people know not to come. McDonald in the same mall is a better choice."}
{"text":"I came for early morning dim sum with my family on a Saturday. We were seated after a 30min wait without reservations so it was pretty standard.
The interior design aims to be something high end with marble like finishes but the whole concept is lost and cheapened by dollar store decor found in every corner of the place.
We were super hyped about the menu, truffle siu mai & foie gras shrimp dumplings, OMFG! They both ended up a miserable disappointment since the fancy ingredients were scarce and did not compliment the dim sum.
Other dim sum were decent, the turnip cake was horrible, but their birthday peach buns were really good. The lotus paste was smooth and sweet without any sour notes of after taste you find in cheaper varieties. 
Service was below par, but prices were not bad since breakfast means all the normal non premium dim sum were the priced as S. They had a lot of unusual items but I say go for the safe stuff."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Casa Deluz for the first time yesterday. We got there around 11:45 and all tables were full. However we only waited about 5 minutes for a table. They had forgotten to leave a dim sum order sheet at the table so we had to ask for one. I don't know what kind of tea they use, but there were lots of leaves that would be in the tea. Once we ordered, it did not take long for the food to arrive. Everything was good, there was just the rice roll with beef that impressed me less. Before 11am, the s/m/l dim sum are all 2,80$. But after 11 I find a bit pricey. The owner had sold a 20$ coupon and10% discount card to my mother in law when we arrived, but the final bill was still expensive. If I return, I will make sure to go before 11am."}
{"text":"There is a dim sum early bird price if you arrive before 11am (need to be seated by that time). Leading up to 11am is really hectic; quite common for people to wait 30 parties in line before they get seated. 
Today my family and I went after 11am 

Food: 4/5
The food was great overall. My favourite was the honey glazed beef (see picture). The hargow was made quite differently (perhaps some pork was in it as well)? The portions were quite large (I.e Siu mai was huge) Everything else was quite standard as compared to other dim sum places. 

Service: 4/5
We were served quite fast - food came out within 5 minutes that we placed our order and we received everything within 30 minutes. They had servers constantly coming around to fill our teapots and hot water pots. Cleaned up our table as we emptied our steamers and plates efficiently."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner. The food was just ok. Most of the items ordered wasn't my favourite but I tried to eat it nevertheless. I only liked the \"shark's fin\" soup (in a nice bowl w/ candle warming it on the bottom) and sticky rice best. The E-fu noodles were dry, the custom chicken dish was too salty (I could pour a lot of soya sauce in a dish too). The fish was nice but it was pricy. Lobster was too gingery. Not a fan of the large veggies w/ the abalone and chicken. 

Casa Deluz can apparently have 80 tables (800-850). Great for large Chinese weddings if you want a more modern Chinese venue. It was nice and bright inside. But I find it was overly blinged up that it looked almost tacky. 

Service was excellent but we were with people who knew the manager and a popular chef so they were extra attentive."}
{"text":"One of those paper and pencil dim sum places. Food came out at a relatively slow pace and was subpar at best. Place is also not very hygienic - one server was bringing a bunch of stuff back to the kitchen and another server just grabs the soy sauce container that was with the dirty dishes and gives it to another table..."}
{"text":"We had our own room set up for dinner here at Casa DeLuz at Woodside Sq

The food came out fairly unusual considering the waitress recommended the menu so we went with whatever she said was good 

Everything was fried and weird, but at the same time still was kinda tasty 

It was someone's birthday in my party so the waitress asked to get a lucky money? Lol 

The bill came up to around $1200 

and yes we all left still hungry. 

But by looking at all these dim sum reviews i might come back to try that! so i guess there's a little chance for a more positive review. stay tuned"}
{"text":"So I have been here 3 or 4 times now, and I must say the consistency of their food and speedy service is pretty good. It's really weird that they have this cheapo banner sign outside of the restaurant but once you walk in everything is shiny and expensive looking, including the over the top chandeliers. Gaudy? Check! Tasty, not too greasy food? Check! Good prices? Check!

But the real question is, will it stick around for a good run or run out of steam like the other restaurants in that location before it? Who knows, we shall see."}
{"text":"Came here for a 10 course banquet, all the standard stuff.  BBQ pork meats, shrimp balls, fish, lobster, fried chicken, chicken stir fried with snow peas and celery, Chinese soup, fried rice, chow mein, etc.

We all thought the food was standard fair, not bad.  The service was quite good too.  I thought the decor was excellent too.  There were a couple of dishes that were not that good so overall I'd give it a 3 star rating.  There were no standout dishes.  Overall, not a bad restaurant though."}
{"text":"I was a very bad experience with Casa Deluz last night that my sister in law holding a big celebration for her newborn boy. I was the first customer arrived the restaurant even earlier than the host, yeah that strange I knew it but yes I am the first customer arrived the restaurant and no one came to me and my little daughter to even asking drinks for us. After ten minutes my sister in law family arrived then they served us a pot of tea but still ignore my daughter needed. First of all, we waited for the other guests for about more than an hour for all guests arrived and my daughter was starved. When I thought that should get my daughter a bowl of white rice to eat, so I asked my waitress who supposed served our table and she said the dinner will start in minutes. When she served as a first dish and I told her my daughter to insist a rice, would you able to get me one? She yelled at me and told me she was so busy to served us the first dish, why not wait until she finished the serving. My husband asked her why she served the guests with no patience and rough. She said she was busy, and my husband so angry and yelled back to her and said that she should tell the guest will get the rice later with polite way. We came for dinner, and not for the bad service. 
Also general the foods are so salty and crispy chicken so dry too."}
{"text":"Casa Deluz Banquet Hall, the newest Chinese restaurant that replaced Regal at Woodside Square.

Chandeliers brightly lit the huge dining room area to the point of blinding. I might need sunglasses.

Early Bird Special Dim Sum $2.80 all sizes before 11 am seems to bring everyone here to try out this new place. If you want to take advantage of this special, come early! They opens at 8 am.

Dinner though is a different story. At 9 pm Friday, the restaurant was empty. Dinner menu has most of the traditional Cantonese dish available.

Chicken with Onion and Mushroom ($12.88) ??????

Chinese Zucchini with Dried Scallop and Mushroom ($14.88) ?????????  

Portion and taste were both surprisingly decent. Even the chicken dish has quite good wok har (fresh from the wok).

Casa Deluz is a pretty good choice if you have a big group as there are a lot of big tables. But prepare to pay a higher price for the experience.

Service though a little awkward for a higher end Chinese restaurant at this price point, Staff needs a lot of training to be up to standard."}
{"text":"Came here for family dinner. Inside is spacious.  Overall food are ok. Few dishes are a bit salty. The red beans soup at the end is good. I like it not too sweet."}
{"text":"We were told by a manager to come for dinner to celebrate new years dinner.  It's one of the most important family dinners, but this sad excuse for a restaurant chooses this night to cheap out on all their dishes.  The prices are still extremely high, yet everything is tiny.  The service is horrendous.  The food came in all the wrong order, the fish was undercooked, and the staff seems genuinely clueless.  How is this place still running?"}
{"text":"Came here to check out the place since the last time it was crazy busy.

It was just me and my mom and ordered 4 dishes.  The chiu chow dumpling, foie Gras har gow, deep fried taro with pork inside and mushroom and green leaf dumpling.

My fave was the foie Gras haw gow. Pieces were huge and meaty. 

Interior is pretty nice too. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke and the biggest scam of a restaurant I have ever experienced. We went this past New Year's Day and we were a party of around 15 people, and we had ordered a set meal of $480. I understand that it was busy and that they had a New Year's party the night before but that's no excuse for our experience there. Either you are open for business and are going to provide good customer service/food or just close up shop. 

Where to start. An hour and a half in and we still did not get our first dish. Then the real problem started. After the appetizer dish showed up, they announced that they didn't have one of the dishes and that they would give us a substitution dish. Sure, bummer, one dish. No wait, that wasn't it...they also didn't have a number of other dishes in our set menu. Yet, they were VERY willing to charge us for the full set menu price. When we called the managers out, they tried to rectify the situation by giving us $25 off? $25 off of a menu that was worth less than $200. WHAT A JOKE! Why don't you give us our time and appetites back, Casa Deloser. 

Food is bad quality, service is horrendous, staff are dishonest. Stay away."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5
Aesthetics: 5/5
Food: 3.8/5
Service: 2/5
Recommendation: Peking duck and lobster

Insta tip: Take pictures of the peking duck from above as it's a flat dish, add several plates into the shot with the steamed buns. It's nice to accentuate the crispiness and colour of the dishes against the white tablecloth! 

I give this place a 3.5 rating because it takes a three years before you can get a dish of food out from the kitchen. Albeit the food was decent and the decor was splendid, the timeliness of the food was really lacking and kills the overall experience. I can understand if a restaurant takes their time (especially if its a nice hall), however we ordered a fried rice and it didn't come until we asked for it about 3-4 times from the manager. 

Peking duck was good, they provide a unique style of eating with taiwanese steamed buns rather than a tortilla in traditional banquet halls - definitely unique and very tasty. The lobster was also cooked quite well, a little undercooked (but understandable for the size). Overall quality of the food is an A+. Unfortunately, they did not have the lettuce wrap with the leftover duck meat which was very disappointing - instead we got some bones to chew on..."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be the old Ruby restaurant where all the banquets were held in the Scarborough area. It is located at Woodside mall which is more on the lower income plaza. The restaurant has ample seating and the staff are quick. The dishes are fairly large and filling, and they do have lots of selection. I found the quality good and not overly salty like usual chinese restaurants. They were able to fit my toddler and baby in a stroller at a bigger table. Only thing is it is more pricier than other dimsum restaurants in Scarborough, and is only cheaper before 10:30am or so. We spent almost $75 for 4 people for lunch."}
