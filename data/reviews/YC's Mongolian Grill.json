{"text":"This place has the most amazing food, which is the only reason we will continue to come back. We were approached by an employee and reprimanded (albeit nicely) for sharing. They made us put half our food into another bowl so it wouldnt look like we're sharing. Forcing people to spend more and eat more than they want is a terrible thing - talk about contributing to obesity. This is not a buffet - what fits in your bowl goes, so this makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"This place is the GREATEST!!! Priced right quick and easy.  Get ready to pack that BOWL YO!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! A coworker and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was blown away by both the food and staff.  You get a large bowl from the cashier and can personally stuff whatever meat, veggies and garnish you want. Then, mix a neat selection of sauces. Finally, watch the entertaining chefs cook your meal on a large heated stone.  Everything comes out fresh, hot and delicious! Want a tip? Use the wax paper next to the chicken to \"stuff\" your bowl. Everything will shrink when cooked and this will allow you to have a bigger meal for the same price."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect here so I came in pretty open-minded.  Experienced YC goers dash in and out by the bar as you eventually find your lost little way to the grill.  I got a little grossed out loading semi-frozen, rolled lunch meat into my bowl, smashing it down to allow for more room,and then repeating: load, smash, load, smash...and it didn't even smell all that appetizing, but I followed what the other sheep were doing.  Thank goodness there was tofu.  I ended up actually eating that stuff.  It's a first for me, liking the tofu over the meat.    Next, you add vegetables, pile them high.  (Not too high or they will be all over your tray)  You then look up at a board that has way too much information written on it and try to figure out the sauce-to-pile ratio.  My friend warned me to add more sauce.  I went a bit overboard on the sauce somehow, as the food was swimming in it after it came back from the grill.    You can't really complain when it's all said and done because you were the chef!  If your food didn't taste so great (like mine) then better luck next time, I suppose. (bye bye, $9)  You can get little fried noodles and other snacks to fill you up, and apparently there is a soft serve ice cream bar there, though it was closed for lunch.  I will say, the iced tea there was very nice and if you are a Waponi Wu tribal member like my friend, they do have orange soda from the fountain machine.  The place is roomy and the employees were super friendly.  Just, go easy on the sauce and good luck!"}
{"text":"We really like it here. The manager is always helpful and the food is made by you so how can it be screwed up! Taught the frenchie to eat off of chopsticks. He made a mess but enjoyed it just the same. Love the patio."}
{"text":"This place blew our expectations out of the water! On our trip to ikea tonight, my husband and I were planning to go to Genghis grill since it was nearby but they were closed. I found YC'S on yelp and it had good reviews. My husband was leary when we first walked in because there was no one at the counter. The super nice waitress/hostess was helping a couple of first timers (like us) with their selections. She was very nice and showed us the ropes and even mixed the sauce up for me. The portions were HUGE! My husband who usually can eat his full meal had to throw in the towel halfway because it was too much food. We both have hearty lunch portions to take to work tomorrow. The soup bar was excellent especially the wontons. For only $23 they provide you such a great 3 course meal. They even had swirl cones for dessert. The hostess made sure we enjoyed our meal the whole time and even let us have free to go boxes since it was our first time. She even threw in a small box so I could take wonton chips. The customer service was excellent and the food was fantastic. I definitely recommend this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Yc's is so great that I frequently go there for lunch with my coworkers. I suggest getting there around 11 a.m. (or after 1 p.m.) to beat the lunch crowd because the line will often extend out of the door by noon. The atmosphere is lively during lunch and the lunch crowd is comprised of a diverse range of folks, from high schoolers, college kids, to professionals and the elderly. I wouldn't suggest going there for a power lunch business meeting because it can be hard to hear over the rabble at times.   The meat is frozen in thin strips, but I actually like that because it means I can cram more in the plate! Use the waxed paper that's placed off to the side to avoid touching the uncooked meats while you squish them down in your plate to get value for your money. Do the same with the vegs you add -- you're not going to care once your meal has been cooked and it's subsequently being consumed and digested! Stick to the recipes unless you feel comfortable experimenting with the sauces, etc., and can cope with, or enjoy, the results.   I've found that Mongolian BBQ works out well for kids. They all seem to enjoy being able to participate in making their own dinners. Definitely stick with one of the milder recipes, though, and go easy on the chili sauce or CPS may pay you a visit.  All in all, I've always had a very positive experience at the restaurant and rate it with four stars as a result."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  We always get there right before 5:00 when the prices change from lunch to dinner.    They do offer menu items, and then have a bar of veggies and meats and sauces at the end.  They have instructions on how you can create certain sauces.  I have found it a little loud at times, and not very much for children to eat there.  For that reason we do not frequent there much now."}
{"text":"Every time I go to YC''s I always have a great experience. Service is great, food is good, place is always clean! The price is the best because it's not expensive but the food is awesome. Making your own sauces is a fun experience also."}
{"text":"1st time to YC. Super friendly and very institutional staff. Clean buffet table (plus) good meat, friendly staff! Thank you. Diffidently will be back again."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!  Just be careful about hostess doing your sauce and putting ladles and ladles of oil on it.  For some, the draw to eat here is to try to eat clean, lower fat meals.  I only tried lunch yesterday but plan to go back today for dinner!!!! Super Ono!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  This was my first time.  The line was long, like 10 people ahead of me, but it moved farely quick.  I ordered the Large lunch bowl.  I guess the idea is to pile it as high as you can.  So when you get your bowl, grab a few paper tissues to use for pushing down your stack. Be careful because if you push on the side instead of the center, it will spill out... I learned from experience.  Then you create your item sauce. There's a menu of how to make your sauce as you look up to your left at the sauce area.  I really appreciated the lady that worked there.  She asked if I'd been there before & I told her no, so she offered to make my sauce.  Very polite.  I got mine to go so you have to tell the guys that are cooking it that you want it to go.  Then you get to add more stuff, like cilantro, peanuts, chili, and other things after or before they cook it. Then you go to the rice & soup area.  The only unhappy thing is they didn't offer a to go soup container,  but a worker noticed me putting soup in my to go box & she said it wouldn't work to we'll and she offered to get me a new to go box for my rice and brought me a to go soup bowl.  So that fixed my problem and because the food is fresh, and the service is extremely polite, I give this place 5 stars.  Lastly,  the price is a little more than average but you get so much.  You can feed 2 to 3 people if you stack it.  There is no sharing, but if you get it to go, you can do whatever you want."}
{"text":"I do not understand why some people are giving this place an low rating. The food here is very good, very fresh and the soups are very tasty.  A small bowl was $8.95 and a large bowl is $9.95. You basically try to stuff as much food as high as you legally can into this small bowl and have the chiefs cook the food in front of you, with 2 GIANT STICKS. Who doesn't think that is cool? It's pretty fun and challenging.  Anyways, The sauces there are excellent and have many variety of choices. There is a person on standby to assist you in choosing the correct sauce for your meal, in case you don't know what to pick. Avoiding an sauce mix up disaster.   Eating here is significantly better than eating at an fast food restaurant. Also drinks, and soups are free. Including refills.  Service at this restaurant is excellent, 5/5 Stars. The waiters are very consistent, helpful and very aware of your needs. 50 Cents to order an take out box. Not a big deal. Not to mention, the girls who work there are cute.  To sum up:   Pros: Excellent Customer Service, Fun to go with a group of friends to try to out stack everybody else. Free refills on soup and drinks. Chief cooks for you with 2 sticks. Good value (if you can stack the food high) I recommend this restaurant, if your up for something new.  Cons: If you are new to this restaurant, and you don't know how to stack up the food, This may not be a good value to you. or if you prefer an real restaurant vs this type of restaurant. The food isn't as good as an normal restaurant, but given that this isn't an normal restaurant, This is not an drawback."}
{"text":"Cheap batards ..... they charge you 50 cents ( with a smile on her face) for a container if you have a leftover. ...that's after I gave them $13 for food a $2 of tip, charged right on cash register. ...  I will take my business  somewhere else. .. not happy  to be nickel & dimed ."}
{"text":"One of the better Mongolian BBQ's I've been to. $10 at the door with drink. Very simple."}
{"text":"Really like it here. I can make my bowl my way and my friend can have tofu....always fresh, alway clean, can't complain about dinner cause I made it."}
{"text":"Solid four stars.  Great service, great food, a lot of food, quickly for a great price.  Environment wasn't as nice as the Wok Box, but man, the food was sooooo much better.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great food and vegetarian options. Peoplenare super friendly and sociable. Would definitely recommend and will be returning again shortly. Pro tip, don't get the large size you'll never manage to finish it! Prices are super reasonable too!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mongolian BBQ chains in the U.S. and priced very reasonably!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  I went here often in college, and I used to be able to get three meals out of it - order a large bowl and a doggy bag.  I love being able to make my own sauce, with lots of garlic, and dont' forget to SQUISH the meat into the bowl!"}
{"text":"Overall a good restaurant with good food. In need of an update though. Value is great."}
{"text":"With practice, you can make a huge bowl, large enough for 3 meals!"}
{"text":"This is the better mangolian type of restaurant within this state, definitely not like the other one that rhymes with bengis (that place is horrible) .   This place can cater to both vegetarians and the meat eaters in your family. The price includes, your creation ( noodle stir fry or just a veggie stir fry ), white or brown rice, 2 types of soups ( both have meat in it though ), crispy noodles, a drink and frozen yogurt (dinner time only ). There is a choice between a kiddies (for ages up to 12 I think ), a small bowl, large bowl and an all you can eat bowl. I always pick the small bowl and fill it up like crazy. It costs about 11 bucks but can easily give me 2-3 meals out of it and its so worth the money, as long as you pay $.50 for the to go container.  I always pack mine with lots of veggies, tofu and noodles. This place has a sauce suggestions and its pretty accurate and tasty but I always go for the spicy peanut thai sauce !"}
{"text":"Although the food was good, the entire dining experience was rather poor. This being my first time here, I wanted to do the unlimited stir fry so I could try different flavors, but the cashier tried to talk me out of it. Then, she handed me a sign that I had to carry around with me so they wouldn't accuse me of stealing. The selection of ingredients is very limited, and most were overflowing mixing in with the ingredients around them. The 2 grills they have can only one order at a time, so if it's busy, you'll be waiting in the buffet line for awhile. If you order the unlimited, you have to go back up to the register, with your sign, to get another bowl, but have to wait in line for customers coming in and having to pay. I would classify this place as fast food restaurant. The layout of the place feels like a cafeteria. Good food, poor concept."}
{"text":"Good food, and great service! Lia was very helpful and informative. Made my first time here very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I love this place. You can pick your meats, veggies, noodles and sauce. You can make it the way that you like it and not feel like you have to pick things out that you don't like.  This is what you do to get the cheapest food ever. So you pay 10.50 for a togo meal. Which includes a drink, soup, rice and your food. Grab and bowl and start piling you food and I mean pile. Basically what fits in you bowl is yours. You usually end up with 2 sometimes even 3 or 4 meals this was. I have seen bowl that make me wonder how that even fits. Anywho..... If you end up with 3 meals then in reality you only paid 3.50 per meal."}
{"text":"Highly recommend ...  Great selection of choices.   Brown rice and rice noodles for those with gluten issues and lots of choices for those who don't - udon, whole wheat noodles, and seafood options which are not normally seen at Mongolian BBQ.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to eat!!! There are so many different healthy options.  Wheat noodles are a must!  The only weird thing I happen to notice every time we go there are so many morbidly obese people!  This place seems healthy, but are there hidden massive amounts of calories somewhere? Lol!"}
{"text":"I am a big mongolian fan.  My trip to this location was very unenjoyable.  It was very hot inside which made us unable to enjoy sitting in the restaurant.  When we left we saw the thermostat was set to 84.  The cook also used a lot of water while cooking causing no flavor what so ever for either of our meals.  The hostess asked others around us how their meals were but avoided asking us (I was not eating my food)."}
{"text":"It's delicious! First time here, the lady at the front was very helpful and explained to us how it works. Love it! Great combination of meat, veggies, noodles & sauces! Yummy!  We will defiantly be back again"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner.  Personally I recommend you stick to the menu items though."}
{"text":"I Absolutely LOVE YC's!!! Unique experience and truly you could create something new to taste every time you go. We have been eating here for 15+ years! Worth every penny... My only complaint is that they don't have locations in the north valley."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. Finally Mongolian Bbq that gets it right. You walk in and you're greeted by friendly staff, at least I have on both visits this past week. You decide if you want the small or large bowl and whether or not you want a return trip to the grill. If you do it right, you only need one trip but its really good so if you're really hungry or want to overindulge by all means pay the extra buck something and go for two.   Fill your bowl with the meat, vegetables, & sauces of choice, pressing the contents of your bowl down with the supplied wax paper sheet to get all you can in the bowl as it'll condense greatly on the grill. They have recipes on the board you can copy or create your own. A staff person can help you create it if you have questions. Hand to the guy at the grill and he'll mesh all the flavors together, and hand it back to you steaming hot. Grab some spicy beef soup (taste like egg drop with beef bouillon with some kick to me) and you're all set. Free yogurt cone (dinner only) tops it off nicely."}
{"text":"Not as high calibur and fresh/diverse as Ghengis Grill. Lunch specials is around 9.50 a bowl per person. Includes drink and soup and wonton crisps.  Meats are usually frozen and rolled up so get a tissue paper to stuff it into your bowl. Press! chicken, pork, beef. choose. I usually get pork.  choose your veggies such as mushroom, zuchini squash, bean sprouts, tofu, etc.  Throw some rice noodles into your bowl.  Add sauce. Add at least 5 to 6 scoops or you won't even taste it. cooking oil, sesame oil, lots of spicy thai, chili oil -- thats the way I like my food.  Hand it over to the Grill guy and wait.  Get your finished food, grab a drink, utensils, soup, and go seat yourself and eat.  There are no servers so that saves quite a bit on tips"}
{"text":"When you think Mongolian Grill, what comes to mind? The obvious: choose your own ingredients, sauce, portion size, and get it cooked as you please.  That's exactly what you get here, except for one crucial difference: it's all so fresh! I've been eating YC's at this location for a decade, and I have yet to eat a meal that I would describe as anything less than delicious.  The service is friendly and great, the food quality is much better than your typical Mongolian Grill, and--oh god--the amount of food you can get is obscene.  Seriously, if you go in with a strategy and an iron will, you can pack an ungodly heap of whatever you wish to eat into (and, let's be honest, stacked precariously above) a bowl, watch them cook it (with water, mind, not oil), and eat until you feel like you need to go to confession.  At lunch, it's eight bucks and a quarter for a small bowl, nine two five for a large, but you can easily get a full meal plus an extra takeout meal out of that.  Dinner is buffet, for eleven bucks, but you also get as much frozen yogurt and other stuff as you can possibly stomach.  And did I mention that it can be pretty healthy? Again, the ingredients are fresh, and you get to tailor it to your own taste as much as you please.   I've eaten at a lot of Mongolian Grill places I've regretted, afterward, but in the countless times I've eaten at YC's, I've always been pleased with what I ended up with. Tip the cooks; they are awesome."}
{"text":"I've been going here regularly for about 12 years.  Always amazed me that YC's was able to stay open when everything else around them was closed for several years.  The great food is what kept people coming back.  It seems like the prices have gone up and at the same time the bowls have gotten smaller, but you can still pack as much as you want into the bowl and still not be able to eat all of it."}
{"text":"Unique, healthy and delicious.  If you want to try something different in the quick service space, this place is a must!  Lots of choices among meats and veggies, great variety of sauces, all cooked up on a big Asian wok...you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and cooks.  Fresh food, a very good variety to choose from!  Your bowl is as good as you make it, there is a learning curve but the staff will help you.  I go once a month for lunch and it's always enough for 3 full meals!  That makes it a really good value.  You have to stuff your bowl with meat and flatten it out with the wax paper that is available, then add the veggies and noodles of your choice.  They have rice noodles too, so if you need to be gluten-free, this place is great.  I have the staff make my sauce, it always turns out better for some reason.  There isn't a lot of Chinese food to choose from in the valley, so this is where I get my Asian food fix!  The soups and rice are good too, and for $1 additional you can get ice cream.   Good stuff."}
{"text":"What? I am  supposed to go out of my house to a restaurant and then make my own dish? Well...the fact i am giving it 4 stars means im good at it :)  This place is amazing because of the large variety of meats, veggies, noodles and sauces and the experience every visit can bring. Takes just a few minutes and the serving size can be as enormous as your squishing abilities are. I have always ended up with enough leftover.  This place is great if you know what to do, its also great if you are the adventurous, experimental kind. If you mess it up, forgive yourself and be back! For me, i have found the recipe that works and i'm sticking to it!"}
{"text":"Good food... cool concept.... lots of variety....but $0.50 for a \"to go box\"??  Really??"}
{"text":"If Paco is not a manager he should be.  He was very helpful in assisting my family in providing a good experience for the kids, helping us with our choose our sauces, and getting the little one into a moving stroller.  Ill come back in a month and steal him to work for our company if he's not promoted."}
{"text":"This is a favorite.  You get to pick the meat you like, then the vegetables then the sauce to top it off. It is a culinary adventure every time.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow... the staff's attitude is beyond disrespectful. My husband and I came here for lunch, I wasn't hungry so I didn't order anything myself. After his food was prepared we sat outside and started having a conversation. In the middle of it he offered me to try his dish and gave me a fork with a little meat and noodles on it. The same second some employee ran outside and started shouting at us! No, he wasn't quiet and polite, he shouted so people at other tables started looking at us with interest. He said my husband was not allowed to give me to try his food because I didn't pay for it. Huh? ... But the food that was on the table had been paid for?! Doesn't matter. You wanna try it - take it home!  I was speechless. For the first time I felt so insulted by a restaurant employee. We took the rest of the food to go and decided to never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Just had the most gratifying experience for lunch at the Tempe YC's . The restaurant was clean, a wide selection of stir fry meat & veggies, All the associates server to cooks were a very happy and  helpful crew. I was especially impressed with my opportunity to inter act with Chris the General Manager. He is the ideal example of customer service. My experience today was delightful and I will be lunching at the Tempe YC's again and again."}
{"text":"Great value considering one meal can essentially be split into 4.  As healthy as you want to make it.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Good selection,  but just have the yogurt part of the meal price. Smaller than other Mongolian restaurants we've been too."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Ask for it to go and you'll have left overs for days.  You can mix sauces to create any flavor you like.  Watch out though, it can get really hot or spicy if you put too much in!  Great for groups, family or a easy date time."}
{"text":"The food was all right, nothing particularly special, but tasty nonetheless. It's the type of place where if a group of friends wants to go, I won't protest.  The service was okay, it depended on the person helping us down the line. The lady in the front was somewhat strange, she looked at us weird and acted awkwardly. She asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, she asked our friends, who had. She then proceeded to say that they could explain how the process work cause it was kinda long for her to do it. There was no one waiting behind us in line, so I thought that was a bit rude but not a big deal.   The idea behind the place is pretty cool! I've been to places like this before, but the selection of ingredients to put in your plate was very extensive in comparison.   The lady by the sauce station was very friendly and professional. She explained how to mix them and helped us out.   The cooking part is pretty cool. They have a round grill in which they spin your food around.   The portion sizes (if you fill your bowl up the right way) are a good size. It would not have felt somewhat pricy if I would have liked the food more."}
{"text":"I love YCs there food is just full of flavor. There are plenty of options to choose from they even have a guide to help you put the right sauces together. But to get rich full flavor double the amount the guide tells you. There's always lots of food and I always bring home left overs. This place is def. worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Came here after a dragon boat race and it was perfect because we were all starving. You can pile up as much meat, vegetables, and noodles as you want and make up your own sauces based on the blackboard they have up. I will say that $11.50 seems like a lot to pay for a bowl, but it was worth it to me since I was stuffed after I miraculously finished my bowl of food."}
{"text":"nice selection of meats and vegetables and sauces.  no msg. healthy. can load up lots of food."}
{"text":"My first time to YC's although I have been to similar Mongolian places. I thought it was strange that as soon as you walked in the register was right there. I was not very impressed. There was a small selection of meats, only consisting of chicken, pork, beef, or fish. I am used to a more wide variety. I would also like a larger selection of sauces. As well as the fact that you have to pay for to go containers? We paid $26 for two meals...I would understand if it was all you can eat, but it's not.  Although, the bowls were a plus, bigger than other places."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time and was there early before they opened.  They were so nice, they came to the door, let us in and got us drinks until they were ready to open, what service!    The food is so good and for the price in unbeatable.  You get a bowl full of meat and vegetables and then they cook it up for you.  I rate it a 5 star for the following reasons:  1. Healthy Eating- Lots of Protein and fresh vegies! 2.  Enough food that I took it hopme for 2 more meals lates and stayed delicous 3.  Service went way above and beyond, they really did care and wanted my business 4.  Very clean!  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We used to come here all of the time, when it was cheaper. Over the last year the prices of YC's has jumped up over two bucks. That's way too large of an increase for just one year. It is now $11.50 to eat dinner here. Even the lunch prices are outrageous, $9.50 for one trip. We stopped coming in awhile ago just because of the prices.  I always liked the food though. Vegetarians FYI, there is seafood stock in the YC's own sauce. I didn't know that originally but found out a few months after being vegetarian after I contacted the corporate office. They told me that the fish sauce and the YC's own sauce are the only two sauces with animal ingredients. Their veggies always seemed decent though.  Here is a tip: If you pack your bowl super full, enough that you know you can't eat it all, get your food to go. I would do this and they would put all of my food in two containers and I wouldn't have to pay the extra $.50 for the take out container they charge."}
{"text":"I updated my review because I was at Mongolian Grill for the second time and they have improve a lot, the food, the service and everything was much better than the first time I visited the restaurant. Is why I`m giving 5 stars because I`m happy with all the service improvement and the food was good and well cook."}
{"text":"Tried mine with their recipe for Thai peanut red curry with an extra scoop of 'curry' seasoning.   Spicy and yummy.   I get better making the sauce each time."}
{"text":"Ever since I've been introduced to Mongolian Grill, I've been hooked. This is the only place I've gone to in AZ   I like that  the bowl of food is one price and includes rice, soup, drink and soft service yogurt. Kids price is based on age so you don't end up paying a ton for food they may not eat. If you need to go for round two, it's only an extra $1.   The staff has always been friendly and helpful and facility clean. The staff is willing to help get you the right sauce. I think this is helpful for people who've never gone or want to experiment.   I do wish this place provide a few more vegetable options and some more sauces. Some of the other locations I've gone too in CA or MD have double these items and can make for a unique dish.  My advise is layer and pack your meats, veggies to the best of your ability to maximize what you can fit into your bowl. I get meat, pack down, add veggies and then noodles and push down, add some more meat and then push down and then get cooked.  The grillmaster serves up your food quickly.  I've been lucky when I've gone it's been before the dinner rush.   Be careful when you take your food back as it will require some cooling off time.  Plan to head back many times.....  Kids might dig the yogurt, but I didn't like the taste."}
{"text":"I work right down the street from YC's, but strangely it took me almost 2 years to actually try it out. I am glad I did! For $8 (including tax!) you can pile your bowl high with meat, veggies and noodles, then you get to play chef and make up your own sauce. I always have leftovers to take home for another meal which is a bonus. The price also includes a drink, won ton chips, soup and rice if you like. The food always appears fresh, which is a major plus. The only downside to this place, is if you hit it during a rush, you might have to wait awhile to get your food cooked....but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical Mongolian grill joint where they cook the food in front of you. Large variety of tofu, meats, and vegetables to pile into your bowl. Many different choices of sauces to pour over your items. If you go for dinner, you will get soft serve ice cream to go with your meal. Staff is pretty friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This location is super far from my house but I was over on this side of town tonight and decided to come here for dinner with my mom. As soon as we walked in Jessica greeted us and was extremely nice. While selecting our ingredients she came over to us and asked us if we needed any help with the sauces. She happily made my mom's sauce and asked me if I needed help with mine. As we sat down another server, Jordan came up to us and asked if there was anything she could get us. We continued our dinner and I noticed the staff cleaning. This is the most I have ever seen any staff anywhere clean. They weren't just going through the motions they were actually cleaning. It was nice to see staff take pride in the restruant. Jessica came by once we were done and took our plates and thanked us as we left. I am so impressed with this location I will be back! (:"}
{"text":"My wife has always refused to eat here, now I understand why. This could be the dirtiest place in town! Although the options appear to be healthy for the most part, I'm very concerned about the cleanliness of this establishment. We even overheard one customer saying his friend became ill the last time they ate here. The trays had grease and sauce all over them from previous customers, soup bowls had old-hard food remains in the bottom. There was food, oils, sauces and spices tossed everywhere along the food bar. I needed a shower after just walking through the food bar. My already dirty tray was again slid through more sauce and debris at the cooking station. I love food like this and can tolerate most anything, but will never come here again."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place today and I was super impressed. I drive past it all the time on my way to the airport and have always been curious. I was a little nervous because I've tried other Mongolian grills before that were set up just like this one and they have never tasted that great. I'm also allergic to nuts and no matter how many times I tell the people at other Mongolian grills...i almost always have an allergic reaction. I wish I got the awesome host's name because she was super helpful to me the whole time I was there. Whenever I looked like I didn't know what I was doing she would come over and help me out. I also wish there was a tip jar in front because I would have loved to tip her for her awesome customer service!   This place not only had great customer service, but also great food! I got my food to-go but this is pretty much how the place works: you have different options on the size of the bowl you can get to fill up. I got the small bowl but it was enough for two meals for me. They have good meat choices, yes the meat is raw and cold but that is why it stays fresh! Then they have different veggies to choose from and 3 types of noodles. You pile as much food as you can inside that bowl and they actually encourage you to cheat to get more food! They give you pieces of wax paper so that you can literally smash the food down and fit more inside the bowl. You can pile it up as high as you want...just as long as it isn't spilling all over the place. Then there is the AWESOME sauce bar. You can make your own sauce by mixing them together, or you can follow their easy instructions that show you how to make specific sauces! I told the cook that I was allergic to peanuts and without hesitation he cleaned the entire grill for me to make sure I didn't get any traces in my food. I also got one box to take either brown rice or white rice home and to-go soup bowl for a side of soup (the spicy beef was soooo good) and a drink.   As you can tell I was very impressed by this place and will be returning again very soon! Lastly, if the host with the brown hair who helped me today is reading this...You're awesome! -sincerely the really lost and confused Asian girl who had to ask you a billion questions."}
{"text":"I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, their mongolian beef one is really good.  Tender meat, perfectly salted peanuts amongst flavorful noodles!!  Can't wait to try this again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Nice sitting area and good selection of meats, noodles, sauces, and vegetables to choose from. There's also a soup/rice bar. Under 10$ for lunch and you definitely will have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great prices!!!  Try the Chef's Favorite as your sauce, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"My parents would love this place. What I mean by that is that they live in a small town, so the build your own, watch them cook it is something different than what's offered in smaller towns.  For me, it was fun the first time. The second time, there's really nothing special about it. Take your big appetite friends, it's a good value for the amount of food you can have made."}
{"text":"The first time I went to YC's was in scottsdale. I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces. they cook it up right in front of you. you can stuff your bowl as much as you can. don't worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents. it is great for leftovers, the food tastes fresh still. The one in tempe was awesome as well. I love this place. I had one larg bowl, a bowl of rice, chicken soup, and a soda for $10.25 how can you go wrong with that???"}
{"text":"fantastic food. I haven't had Mongolian in years. this location did more than hit the spot. great prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE YC's! I like the fact that you can choose if you want to be super healthy with veggies and tofu or go and pig out on meat and noodles. YCs is never disappointing and is now located by a fro yo place so win-win!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little Mongo Grill. The meat is sub-par, but not awful. You do get to choose how much meat you get which is different from some of the grills here in Washington. There's a decent selection of things, but they're missing some key things that would make it superb. (Baby Corns, Spicy peanut sauce etc...) The Noodles were quite tasty and portions were large. Would go again."}
{"text":"So clean! I always have an amazing meal that I created myself!! I brought my friend here for his first time and Maria was so helpful as well as the rest of the staff!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I only go here once every couple months or so and I always forget how cool it is. Their food is awesome especially compared to others places around here. YCs us definitely on top.   Two things I've rrad. One person claims they got food poisoning twice lol I just say bs. No way it was from restaurant. The place is pretty damn clean. I bet money she didn't wash her hands anyway that girl crazy but the real psycho is the chick who said it's too expensive and you pay for Togo boxes. The amount of you get is ridiculous. I mean a massive amount of food. Me and my girl and we have leftovers clear for dinner the next day. And the boxes are huge.I'd be surprised if someone could eat an entire box. And if you say it's Togo from the start they don't charge you extra. Trust me up r food will be hot when you get home. I live 40 min away and it's still hot  Anyway two large meals ends up fitting into 4 boxes and could easily food a family of 4-5 or just for 2 and save em for the next day"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. We went in on a Friday night and they had enough employees to serve and cook. The only feedback I would offer is to be more flexible. They wouldn't let us split a bowl between two people or order any bowl smaller than a large bowl. It's a lot of food! Then when we asked for a take home box they wanted to charge $.50/box. Not everyone wants to eat that much food in one sitting so they should be willing to offer smaller options or not nickel and dime you for take out boxes."}
{"text":"Incredible food and even better staff. I have come here practically every week for a while now and my most recent trip will solidify this as my prime location. Sulma and Lliana were extremely helpful and even gave my girl and I two coupons with our meal. Nothing but good things to say about those two women."}
{"text":"Love this place. Get the big bowl and a Togo box. It's just as good the second time!  Oh, and stop staring at my bowl...I know it's good."}
{"text":"~ A regular costumer at YC' Mongolian Grill~  ~I admit the sauce making is a little challenge although the employees are excellent in creating the sauces..  ~Friendly atmosphere & clean!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to fill up for not much money. The selection is great and if you are even lost or confused the workers are great and will help you out. They always ask if you need help with making the sauce which for a lot of people is the hardest part.  You also get rice, soup and soda with your meal. If you go in for lunch you have to pay for ice cream if you want it but I believe at dinner time its free. Dinner you have two bowl choices of small or large and for a dollar more than the large bowl you can get all you can eat. However, I am not sure why you would pick that option since a large bowl is a lot of food.   The only down side is if you want to go boxes they cost 50 cents. Although I have seen workers give these for free to a lot of people. I am just not sure how they decide who to charge and who not to."}
{"text":"great stir fry with big portions and great for leftovers. a little pricey."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've eaten here! I took my bro-lo with me (his 1st time) and showed him how to get two full take-away containers. The service was on point and my meal (Mongolian) was fantastic. The leftovers was enough for two people...I shouldn't have, but I did."}
{"text":"The food bar was clean at this location, items were well stocked and staff was extremely friendly. The grill/cook catered to requests and offered tips that helped make the experience better than my last.  I came to this YC's , as I had a bad experience at another location on two occasions. The grill specialist did not water down my bowl ( he added my oils/sauces AFTER water was applied to the grill).  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT as it preserves the quality and taste of your bowl (make this recommendation when you visit)   Inspect the laddles/spatulas handles before you touch them , as other patrons are not sanitary. This is NOT YC's fault.  This location was constantly walking around, cleaning and stocking items.   TIP:  Place your oils/sauces in a SEPARATE BOWL.  Don't let the cook at the grill add a lot of water to your food .  Request that the water is added BEFORE adding your oils/sauces.   The overall experience was enjoyable and I would recommend the YC's chain again. Thank you to the owners/management for correcting a previous experience."}
{"text":"Love this food but the people at this location go above & beyond in being helpful - best attentive employees of the 4 different locations that I have visited. Always clean and inviting to eat here."}
{"text":"Some of the best customer service since living in Tempe the last 6 months. Helpful staff. Good selection of meat and veggies plus the large list of suggested sauce options is helpful. My only suggestion would be to have regular lemonade to mix with the selection of iced teas. Pink lemonade was available."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation, and it did not disappoint. The food was good, probably 4 stars. It's kinda fun to build your bowl. Think...Sweet Tomatoes meets stir fry. But what really made the experience 5 stars (I would give it 6 if I could) was a girl who worked there, Katy (Katie? Sorry on the spelling). She had an incredible attitude, was beyond helpful, and so kind and bubbly. Even if I hadn't liked the food, I would come back just for her.  If you come in and she's your cashier, you'll know it's her right away (they don't wear name tags). Just say hi and she'll be your new BFF forever.   Thanks to Katie/Katy, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We've gone to this place a couple of times and haven't been dissatisfied once. The overall joy of YCs is getting to fill your bowl a mile high with pure gluttony. The selection of ingredients was right on, the quality could leave some yearning but this is definitely a Quantity over quality establishment. No complaints on that part because I still found the food to be flavorful and fulfilling. The free ice cream at the end is a sweet added bonus and much appreciated.  I look forward to going here when I don't feel like cooking and like the experience of abundant selections and flavor options. Recommended highly:-)"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and Cooked right  in front of you, I had never been there before, but Wow, what a treat, u choose what ingredients u want in your dish, and u make your own sauce to put on it, from a recipe board on the wall, It is so different, so much better than panda, All I can say is just go there and experience the treat of your life...."}
{"text":"In Tempe visiting my sister and checking out some Spring Training. Never heard of YC's but came by because my sister had a coupon to use. The food was great, but the service we had tonight was extraordinary. I didn't catch the register guy's name, but he completely went above and beyond helping all the guests, making and recommending sauces and just spreading his overall warm personality. Management has a great hard worker in their hands!  9PM - Monday, March 27th"}
{"text":"I was here for a Sunday dinner. Price to value, this place easily deserves five stars. For $13, you get to choose your ingredients to make your own custom noodle, hot soup, free soft drinks and two flavors of ice cream.   It is best if you read some of the reviews here before going to the restaurant so that you know what and how to pick and how to make your noodle because it can be pretty overwhelming for newbies.   Don't be afraid to load up your bowl-- Meat (Chicken, Pork, Beef, Fish), Veggies and 3 types of noodles. When it comes to choose sauces, just look up and read up the flavors to get some guidance. IMPO, sticking with a pre-defined flavor is a good idea than just randomly mixing a whole lot of sauces. It is going to be a lot of food, so plenty of leftover to take home as well.  Tip the cooks near the grill and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"In from Chicago, third or fourth time here, great food! Tip: pack the meat choice down tight, buy a take home container for leftovers! Yummo!!"}
{"text":"YC's is a fun way to get a real fix on a good, affordable dinner! You feel a sense of control when you dish yourself up cramming as much meat and other fix-ins into your dish before you season it with a good variety of flavor a and watch their chefs entertainingly grill your bowl of goodies into a scent-filled delicious entree! Complete your entree with a variety of complimentary foods like white or brown rice, or some warm Mongolian soups. Drinks are included and so is soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite. The buffet style allows everyone to choose their own ingredients- lots of choices of different meats, vegetables and sauces. Great way to get the kids to eat lots of fresh vegetables. The staff is very friendly and willing to assist you with preparing sauces if you have not done it before. Watching the chefs cook the food in front of you on the large grills is fun."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food great price! What else you need? I don't think you will hear negatives comments about this place, maybe the process can make you hesitate, but is all about throw things to your plate and give it to some one else to cook it, yes, is that simple."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place today and had never gone to a build your own grill like this. Breana (not sure spelling) was such a sweet heart and showed us the ropes! The food was plentiful and yummy. We took home leftovers for what is another meal. Thank you Breana you made our experience great and we look forward to eating here more often now that we \"know the ropes\" lol"}
{"text":"First time here and I was pretty impressed! I really liked the \"salad bar\" set up so you can have as much of whatever your taste buds desire. Then it's cooked immediately which keeps the flavors fresh and hot! I wasn't blown away by the finished product, but the portions and preparation alone was well worth the money. But wait... There's more!! Your drink is included along with bottomless soup, wonton chips, and ice cream!! I had to take away a star for their limited locations, but overall a great lunch experience for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievable in that the help staff are warm, helpful and noticed we're seniors so offered a discount without our asking.  In addition,  the choices, quality and amounts offered were generous and delicious.  I'm vegan, so they were very helpful in showing me options."}
{"text":"YC's is awesome. Plain and simple. Awesome.   When you eat at YC's, you are not simply a patron. You become an architect-chef-artist hybrid; the ingredient bar becomes your palette, your hands become your paintbrush, and your bowl becomes your canvas. After paying your $10.25, you are given permission to create a masterpiece.  Your first stop on this culinary Safari is at the meats. Slightly frozen, these curls of chicken, beef, pork, and cod look kinda freaky to be honest. But give it time. By midnight these freaky little meat swirls will become your Cinderella. You will be longing for more. This is also the beginning of your architect job. You must begin balancing your bowl in such a way as to create a stable mountain of Mongolian delicacies maximizing the $10.25 entrance fee. You do so by utilizing the parchment paper provided and squishing all of your ingredients to their basic form in your bowl. Watch someone else if it's your first time. It's an art.   Next step the vegetables. Still utilizing the parchment paper to hulk smash every ingredient down to its most compact form, continue to pack that baby with everything you can! The veggies are also fresh and delicious.   Finally: stacking noodles. This is the most vital step in your architect role. Pile these babies on!!! The wheat noodles are like strings of happiness. They will make you smile.   The last role that you must play is that of chef. It's more like mad scientist. At this point in front of you there are seemingly hundreds of containers of magic potions (or sauces) and you are given the task of creating the elixir of life. The sauces are delicious no matter what you do. Don't fret too much.   Lastly you hand your heaping mountain of Mongolian BBQ to the gentlemen that will shortly become your best friend. He will then take your masterpiece and turn it into a steaming heap of bliss. At this point, you enjoy.   YCs is delicious. Go there for lunch. Or dinner. Or your birthday. Or your graduation. Or one year anniversary. Or 20 year anniversary. Or wedding. Or anytime."}
{"text":"Love the build your own style here! It's a great place to go with friends and pack your bowl full of delicious food... And you can make it overflowing! Always left overs so make sure you get the .50 doggie bag to take home."}
{"text":"Our family lives in Chandler and they're fans of this place. We went with a group of 6 and had no trouble finding a seat on a weeknight. My brother gave us the lowdown on how to create a bowl, it's key to press the meat down. I'm been to stir fry places like this before, but never a Mongolian Grill. Quite enjoyed my bowl and I'd definitely come back to YC's.  Super casual atmosphere, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Doing a happy dance!  YC'S used to be one of my favorite spots to grab a quick meal, until , about 10yrs. ago when  I found out the mystery behind all of my illness was food allergies to wheat, corn and cow dairy.  I tried to eat there and just use my GF Tamari, but there was still the issue of the grills having too much residue from other meals.  Recently my daughter informed me they had made a big change in handling special allergy needs and she was excited for me to go there.  If you deal with food allergies you will understand my skepticism, so, it took some time before I managed to try it out.  I am here to tell you, it was fabulous!   They are SO incredibly accommodating and helpful.  The staff were all cheerfully helpful.  Everyone was knowledgeable and aware of ingredients and respectful of my needs. The hostess put an allergy alert card on my tray and assured me I would be assisted with the sauces, which I Was. The grill cook was cleaning the grill before I even got to the counter.   He was cheerful and friendly,( and grinning at the fact that I was taking photos).  My food was beyond delicious! I had Panang Thai sauce, extra spicy.  They even have rice noodles!  I am So, so,so excited to be able to eat here again.  The perfect spot for before or after a movie, or to stop while shopping, or you know, if you just happen to be hungry for yummy stir fry done your way and don't want to do dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been going here for years.  There is a reason why this is the only restaurant that survived in the Pavilions after all of the other restaurants, movie theater, and Best Buy were closed.    You make your own mix of meat, noodles, rice, veggies, sauce, etc. and they cook it on the wok for you.  Prices have gone up since I first started going here.  I believe dinner used to be $7.50 and now it is around $10.25 (for dinner, lunch is cheaper), but it is a lot of food.  Get a to go box for $.75, which comes out to $11.  Keep in mind this includes a drink and a huge amount of food, if you get a to go box it is enough for another meal."}
{"text":"This place is my fave. I could buy this for life. The variety of options is great. When you first pay make sure you ask for a allergy card just in case. My girl is allergic to fish and bell peppers. Once they see it at the grill the will promptly clean it for you. The stairs is tricky but I have mine down now. 2 laddles  of 2 yc own 2 garlic 2 orange 2 ginger water it comes out great. You get a huge bowl and rice on the side. You can do soup and the drink are included with the price. I suggest lunch there it's a little cheaper and you be full all day. Thanks kris"}
{"text":"This place is great and the service is outstanding. I had never been here before and the manager personally helped me. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Love this place! A lot of bang for the buck! Prices are affordable, food is always fresh and staff is always very helpful & friendly. Besides filling up on meat or fish and veggies, there is soup and rice and drinks are included.. Will eat here again & again.  You get as much as you can put in a bowl and if you want to take home the remainder it costs only 50 cent. You can make it according to you own liking."}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative number I would!  I swear people in Phoenix have NO TASTE! This place sucked BADLY!!!  You make your bowl, you put your sauce on, but where the heck are the spices? That's not even the worst part.  The worst part is they use water to cook the food and wash off all the sauce you put on.  Bland, bland, bland.  I'm from the mid-west and we know food.  You know the kind that sticks your ribs that actually has this thing called \"FLAVOR\"!  If you want a good mongolian place to eat, spend the money and eat at BD's Mongolian BBQ.  You have soooo much to choose from and you can even have a salad.  Pros: There isn't any unless you haven't eaten in weeks.  Cons: No flavor. Wash the little taste off. Felt sick after eating there. Tons of water in the bowl. Smelled like a toilet."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prepared exactly how YOU want it. Lots of variety of veges and meats, lots of different sauces to try. Separate bowls for food and sauce, so be sure to fill up both. If you leave here hungry, you only have yourself to blame! Don't come here with a bashful appetite, it will be a waste!"}
{"text":"I fly here from CA just to have some really good Mongolian Grill."}
{"text":"This is not only a bathing but god is excellent.   The icing on the cake is a server named Janet.  She is always on the move and keeps the place spotless.  She is always helpful and efficiently when she helps us mix toppings.  And ALWAYS with a smile I thought she was a manager but was shocked that she is not.  She should be.  All in all, it is always a joy to eat at this unit"}
{"text":"Amazing place. You make your own bowl, then add your own sauce. You can put as much food as you want into your bowl. Very well done."}
{"text":"Man have I missed this place, and was glad to see they are still open.  I used to go to the one at metrocenter a LLLLLOOOOONNNNNGGGGG tome ago, so I was psyched to find this one out near where i was staying.  I have to say it was even better than i remembered.  Keep up the good work YCs!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Minneapolis last weekend and the family tour director chose YC's because it would accommodate the vegetarian in the bunch.  She was thrilled to see tofu offered.  The cashier was helpful in guiding us to which size bowl to pay for.  The food was very good and I would happily return if I ever get to Scottsdale again.  You should go!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool!! You basically move through a buffet style line and pack your bowl with uncooked meat, veggies and seasoning sauce. Then you bring it to the cooking area, which the guys cook it in front of you on huge circular fryer. It's a little pricey, about $10 a bowl, but if you pack your bowl really well you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"YC's is just so tasty!  I have been going to YCs for over a decade and I've never had a bad expierience. love the idea of mongolian grill in general, but what is great about YC's compared to a lot of other mongolian grills is that the sauces are on the lighter side and everything is always fresh.  You basically make it yourself - so it is hard to go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for years. The variety of meats, veggies, spices, and sauces are excellent. The drinks are included in the price of each bowl. The staff have always been friendly and I have never had a bad experience here. I moved to another state and I look forward to having lunch/dinner at YC's when we come to visit."}
{"text":"I emailed the company just to let them know about my experience and the employees that were acting so unprofessional.  I was contacted (hadn't expected that) and was very impressed at the customer service and concern over my experience.  It restores some of my faith in customer service in general and in the care this manager had for his company.  I will give them another chance. 5 stars for this managers response and handling of the situation."}
{"text":"This is one of my top places to eat any time of the year.  I've been visiting YC's since the late 90's and will continue to dine here.  Even though this is a self service based restaurant, the customer service is always tops.  The cashier is always pleasant and the cooks/grillers are always attentive.  The buffet style line to select your ingredients used to be single file one line.  A few  years back they expanded to two lines and two grills; very helpful on weekend nights with ASU in session.  The food selections and sauces are consistent and tasty.  The diner/fast food style seating is just fine with me, we always choose a booth.    Not sure if this location is still owned by the body building man who was always checking our tables for satisfaction, but either way this is one of the staples of our diet."}
{"text":"My group came in grumpy and whiny. But the manager went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. At first glance, prices seemed high but all drinks were included so actually it was a good deal. Items were fresh and tasty. Definitely go again. Staff appeared happy and helpful"}
{"text":"Not like any other Mongolian grill. The best in the 3 states I've tried to find similar. Never the same as YCs. The Scottsdale location is the best. Staff is friendly. Down to the ice cream and soups. Everything is so good."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Love all the fresh food options, and it is grilled right in front of you.  Be sure to use the wax paper squares at the beginning of the line to shove down the items in your bowl as you move down the line.  Things do shrink on the grill.  If you like rice, pile up your bowl with the meat and veggies, and add the rice after the grill so it doesn't take up room in your bowl.  My personal fave sauce is the YC's Favorite + 2 scoops of the Thai Peanut sauce...YUMMMMMMMO!"}
{"text":"We've been here 3x now, and enjoyed each visit more as we've learned different things to make meal even better each time. You have a choice of large or small bowls at the start of the buffet-style line. Make use of the papers at the beginning of the line as you can use them to compress the food in your bowl and add more. (This is not meant to sound greedy-your food will shrink when you get to grill at end). Just before the grill there is a table of small bowls and assorted fluids to make different sauces which are added to food while it's being grilled. the first 2 visits staff were very helpful in assisting us to make sauces, I assumed as they were not busy. Yesterday we visited at lunch hour and they were still helpful and friendly while somehow being everywhere at once-greeting and taking payment (done at beginning), assuring those in line, and keeping dining area clean and stocked. The available extras (rice, soup, and frozen yogurt) and drinks included are a nice touch. I don't understand people complaining about having to pay for boxes for left-overs, as a general rule stir-fry does not reheat well. We will continue to return whenever we're in area."}
{"text":"I first learned about YC's through a friend of mine (who is a regular), who very strongly recommended this buffet-style restaurant. Generally I do not dine at buffets for I do not consider the food served at traditional buffet to be appetizing. My friend who had recommended that I give the establishment a go, accompanied me on my first visit to the renowned Mongolian Grill; for he would guide me on how the buffet works. My first impression of the restaurant was that it is extremely open and inviting. Not to mention how well kept the cleanliness and sanitation of the entire restaurant is. Walking in, both my confidant and I were greeted by a very attentive and welcoming cashier. Looking at the menu there are the choices in buffet bowl sizes, and any extras that you would like to additionally have with your meal; a drink (with unlimited refills), rice, and soup, are included with your purchase of the buffet bowl. Now let me tell you ladies and gentleman, you absolutely do get what you pay for! Personally, the size small along with all the sides that come along with your entrée is more than enough food for not just one, but two meals.     Moving on, my comrade had brought me over to the buffet bar itself to begin building my one-of-a-kind Mongolian meal. The first section of the bar consists of meat, including: chicken (white and dark meat), pork, beef, shrimp, and Alaskan Cod. Following the meat, is a wide selection of vegetables such as, watercress, onion, baby corn, ect. Thereafter was a choice of noodles; wheat, rice and undone. Lastly you come to a very large variety of customizable creations composed of sauces and spices. On the wall above, there was a list of 16 different flavor combinations that you can put together by reading the flavors' ingredients list. This sauce that you make will be what helps bring the truest flavors of your meal together. The final step of making you Mongolian masterpiece is to hand your meal over to the professional stir-fry chef to perfectly cook your delicacy. It is apparent that it requires a great deal of training and skill to accomplish this. The very friendly man or woman will then hand back to you your finished product in which you will hopefully find as delectable as I did. You then continue to go to the mini bar if desired to pick yourself up some perfectly cooked rice; brown and white. You will too find that you can have a cup of soup and some wantons if desired. All at the same time, you can also get a refreshing beverage.     The dining at YC's Mongolian Grill was a serendipitous experience. I was able to enjoy my meal in a comfortable atmosphere with my buddy whilst there was subtle background music that was not hard to communicate with others, but just lightened the restaurants mood. The staff was very beneficial, attentive and responsive to my needs. My meal itself was undeniably the best tasting buffet-style food that I had ever eaten. Unquestionably, I will be a returning customer and undoubtedly recommend YC's to someone looking for a little flavor variation."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a YC's.  I love Mongolian food but there are very few places that do it well.  This is one of the best places I have been to.  The hostess was extremely nice and helpful.  Marium's (sp?) service was top notch.   The food had really good flavor with a nice selection of meats and sauces.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"great food, lots of fun, great soups, cleaner than most Mongolian type grills."}
{"text":"This restaurant in the best around and I am not surprised it has lasted there for so long! I love how you can build your own meal and get a large amount of food  for the money! Their staff is very nice and always welcoming. Their original sauce is the way to go when you mix the sauces!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!!  The food is always great...I love the different sauces you can use to create your own masterpiece.  The young staff is verry attentive and friendly.  A great place for a healthy, low cost meal"}
{"text":"Very generous, good value and staff super nice. USe the sauce bowls an get creative. Spicy Thai was delicious :)"}
{"text":"There is a lot of variety of ingredients for you to make your own noodle bowl.  Everyone can end up with exactly what they want.  They charge for kids meals by the age of the child, so you don't sped a fortune on a bowl for a 3 year old."}
{"text":"Come with an appetite! Make your own stir fry with a lot of veggie and meat options. Plus soup, rice, chips, and frozen yogurt (dinner). My stirfry concoctions strangely end up tasting the same though. Possibly the super thin meat shavings end up kinda bland. But great joint. Crave it from time to time...like now."}
{"text":"The food is here is really good. The only thing is this place feels and looks old. I've been to the newer locations and they are much nicer and cleaner for the same price. But overall food is delicious."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time yesterday and I am very impressed. The food was amazing and the price was more than fair. You get a lot of good food for the price. Also everything looked and tasted so fresh. The restaurant looks very clean as did the restroom which is also very important to me. I look forward to going back there again, nice place."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. So of course was the first place I had to come upon arriving in AZ. Lots of fresh veggies and healthier options."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here for dinner last week, I loved it!!  I've never had Mongolian BBQ before and I loved picking out my own ingrediants & flavors.  Next time I'll take more time to see what flavors they have as my sauce wasn't quite what I was looking for (needed more flavor).  I think this place gets PACKED though so not sure when I'll be back (hopefully soon!)"}
{"text":"I love YC's.  I've been eating here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"Been here for Pavillion's car show before.  GREAT Mongolian.  Love the recipes feature, love the atmosphere, cleanliness, the workers, the food is amazing and so filling, you always take home leftovers which are always great.  Definately a great place to eat.  Be sure to try the wheat noodles and the brown rice.  Their sauces are SO good whether you follow the recipes or not.   It's nice to have the wheat-based options too."}
{"text":"There is a reason YCs is better than a place like Genghis Grill. The reason isnt the meat or the vegetables. Its the fact that you can take it to go. And some say oh you only get to go up once. But that only makes it better, half of the fun is making your plate as big and high as possible. And lets be honest going up many times you are still not getting as much as you do when you get to take it to go. Its smart marketing by Genghis Grill but you really arent getting the same amount as you would at YCs. YCs does taste great and It is the only place that I consistently go on a weekly basis. Even if it is a little expensive it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Good food , build your own . Sauces are good , portions are great ( if you can stack it lol )"}
{"text":"OK I've eaten here for years and never ever had a problem. The food is great and moderately priced for the portions.  Being a family of four (wife, kids and i) we have found that two servings to go is plenty of food to feed us all. My kids are both under 10 and barely eat lol.  During our trip through the buffet line creating our masterpiece bowls, my wife was informed that we had to leave if we were getting our food to go. I simply asked why? She informed me that there's no sharing.  I asked well Is it endless trips to buffet? -She says no. I say so why does it matter, we like to get it to go because we can't eat it all and we will take what's left home. She then told me that by doing that we are RIPPING THE OFF! I Know that this is just an employee speaking there mind without a filter and I assume management wouldn't approve but this definitely upset my wife and made us leary of returning.    Brings back a saying I've heard: \"Don't hate the player, hate the game\"  YCS YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR EMPLOYEES TO ENCOURAGE FAMILY'S TO ENJOY THEMSELVES NOT INSULT THEM OVER A FEW DOLLARS. LOYALTY?"}
{"text":"The food at YC's is always great. I think they are very affordable considering they cook whatever you can pack into a bowl plus a drink, soup, and rice. I've noticed the cooks at this location are less than stellar though. The one on Elliott is better, though this one is good too."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent I would surely recommend it but the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the charge $0.50 for to go boxes like if I am fool and I want to bring it home I am basically paying to bring the food I paid for earlier and bring it home"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. I thought it was very cool and simple for the exception of the sauces. Way to many to choose from and I didn't want to risk making my own and screwing up the whole meal. I had the lady who worked there help me who was really nice and had great customer service skills. Food was also good and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Made for the regulars.  Our first time eating here, selection choices is overwhelming, if you know what you want, it will work out for you.  I piled in meats, veggies, made some mad scientist sauce, it was not that good.  If you know what to add, it will work out for you."}
{"text":"$9 or $10 flat fee gets you a bowl in which you can moosh and pile high with meats, vegetables and noodles.  Grab a few tissues by the meat and crunch down the everything as you go.  If you have someone with you take a tissue and their bowl and smash your stuff down and they can do the same.  At the end is tons of sauces and a menu board with favorite combinations.  I tend to make my own mixture of two of the sauces and double up on what they recommend because I usually have a TON of noddles and meat.  Double your sauces and you will get tons of sauce.  I recommend getting a \"doggy bag\" at the beginning because if you pile on your food you will have extra for a few days.  They are only 50 cents so it is very affordable."}
{"text":"We've tried this out several times and have had a consistent good experience so I suppose it's time to review than.  You basically make it yourself here so if the food sucks it's sort of my own fault, it never has though so maybe they've made the system idiot/me proof.  You buy an empty bowl and fill it with raw ingredients from a buffet bar.  I believe in packing the bowl as full as is possible but this inevitably results in my bowl being a towering and unwieldy mess by the end.  They cook it for you.  My wife has food allergies and they are really good about cleaning the grill for her and cooking hers first, which allows her more time to criticize me for what a giant mess I've made of my bowl.  They are a little pricey, but I always get a second leftover meal out of it which I say justifies the mess I made but my wife still thinks I'm an idiot, and isn't happy I brought a messy to go container into our otherwise clean refrigerator but she can write her own damn review if she feels so strongly."}
{"text":"YC's is awesome!  Great, real, tasty food.  And this particular location rocks, especially because of the local staff - very well trained and you can tell that they love working here.  I am usually hesitant in giving a gratuity up front but in this case we are glad we did - excellent service with a neighborhood smile."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly. Loads of variety. Not much more costly than McDonald's.  Sure they use thin sliced frozen meat. But overall the ingredients are quality, the price is right and the taste.. That's is as good as you make it by how you mix your fix. They charge .50 for a to go box which is lame, but they didn't charge me when I needed them for the kids. Young man managing the place is very attentive.   Go and enjoy.."}
{"text":"When we first arrived I was not sure what to do but the hostess  was very nice. Every thing is buffet style but uncooked you pile your bowl as high as you can get it and they have recipe for you to mix sauces together to make specialty sauce either you are the waitress  can  make them. Then you watch the chef cook the food and sauce together  in front of you . Quite an experience. I can say I honestly enjoyed there food so much I ate it for three days. Yes, I had that much left over .I ate it three more times after I left the restaurant  and it was just as delicious. Follow the lead of everyone else pack the bowl so high it seems stupid. When it cooks down you'll be the smart one. Can you say ....lunch ,dinner, lunch again all in one :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this wifey's Mongolian Grill. It was very clean the vegetables were very fresh everything was very fresh. The staff was very friendly, the real guy was super nice very friendly. Again I have nothing bad to say about this place great service it's not super cheap by any means we got the unlimited two balls for 32 bucks but waters. But it's unlimited and you can get what you want. Make concoctionsAnd try different things out. So again the special great thank you for the great service"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner at 9 pm. I took the unlimited dinner option. I liked that they had option of fish in their meat section. Also had a good selection of veggies and sauces. The line moved fast and the place was clean. Very healthy meal away from home if you don't take noodles as the veggies and meat are filling."}
{"text":"For $10 you really get a lot of food and the staff is usually very pleasant.  I've been here numerous times and the food is always fresh and tastes great!  There are so many options here.  You can add as much meat and vegetables to your bowl as you want along with pastas and sauce.  I change it up almost every time I come here."}
{"text":"1. Wax paper 2. Muscles 3.) food for days!   Seriously, even if you opt in for the small- if you can smash; you'll have noodles for the next 2 days. So worth the money!"}
{"text":"You pick the meat, veggies and sauce... They cook it... You enjoy.  Super friendly. Always clean. Even my children like to eat their veggies here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome. You decide the ingredients and the sauce combination for the stir fry; it's great. It is a regular for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Went back with my girls this afternoon and had a very similar experience.  The dinner price has increased AGAIN, now over $40 for 3 of us and this didn't even include ice cream.  Staff camped out in the back booths again eating food from somewhere else.  The saving grace for this place is the food, which is excellent, and this is the most important thing, so we agreed to raise our rating to 3 stars, but doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here since it first opened.  I love this place.  Now that I have moved to West valley I still try my best to get here once a month.  I think the price to affordable for most incomes."}
{"text":"Went in to this restaurant for lunch, unaware that it specialized in health foods. I'm not typically one to watch what I'm eating, and I'm not a huge vegetable fan. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the abundance of ingredients and choices. The chicken was super tasty and the vegetables that I chose blended perfectly with the garlic sauce I picked. The cashier was very helpful and gave us a tour of the ingredients to choose from. The only thing I wish they had was more standard options, like lo mein noodles, orange sauce and ginger roots. Even though it's healthier fare, I had also wished that they had a normal soy sauce along with their low sodium soy sauce. Other than that, I would say this is the perfect restaurant for a quick and healthy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This probably one of my favorite restaurants. The service is wonderful and the food is even better. The food is fairly priced maybe even underpriced depending on how well the customer can stack ingredients in a bowl ."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and usually very good but then again you make your own bowl so if you screw it up its your own fault!"}
{"text":"Visited YC's for lunch yesterday.  It had been years since I had been there and yes they have raised their prices but who hasn't.  It is still a good value with all that is included.  The staff was very, very helpful and the facility was very clean.  I had a delicious and healthy lunch.  I will definitely return more often."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since as long as I can remember... and I still love it. I lived in Tucson, and would make day trips just to come eat here.  I'm a little disappointed that they made their bows smaller, kinda seems to me like they were looking to follow the \"genghis\" way... considering their competition is just down the street. But nonetheless this place holds a little piece of my heart... and I will still continue to come here time after time."}
{"text":"Upon our arrival we were greeted by the smiling Maria and since my two guests had never been here, she had took time to explain how everything works. I loved how they give you an extra small bowl to apply your sauces I fill it with two parts yc's own, one part spicy Hunan, one part garlic, and don't forget the spicy oil!!! Great experience was had and now my guests look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat  that is within a couple miles from where I work.  I've also brought the wife and little ones here numerous times.  My son and daughter love the food and atmosphere.   You can get in and out of here fairly quickly and the the final product is extremely consistent even though you are choosing your own sauces and ingredients to customize your own bowl. The unlimited soup is always hot; however, my only complaint is that the brown rice sometimes clumps together and is hard, as if it was overcooked and has been sitting in the serving container for too long. I like how many of the sauces are more water based than oil and syrup.  Also, the staff is outgoing and friendly every single time.   My only complaint is how they make you pay 50 cents if you want to take home your leftovers after just one trip through the buffet line. I also wish that they offered eggs to be fried with your bowl."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance. My first visit was a few weeks back (right before closing time, but was served very nicely by the hostess and a friendly cook).  Today, I was greated by a hostess. She asked what size of bowl I would like and if it was my first time. I chose the \"medium\" bowl (huge mistake... IT'S A LOT OF FOOD) and replied with a \"yes\". She walked with me and gave me tips on how to make a delicious combination.   I am a believer! I enjoyed my meal and I loved the personal touch the hostess gave to my experience.  The concept is similar to Genghis Grill (mongolian grill) with a simpler selection of proteins and vegetables, and sauces instead of condiments. They have a visible board with a list of combinations for the customers to try.   They do not serve alcohol (only reason why I would prefer Genghis Grill) over YC now, and it is fast casual (unlike Genghis where the friendly servers are always helping out customers).  Different colors and flavors for different tastes. I am glad I tried this place out.... Hope they keep up with the awesome experience I enjoyed today."}
{"text":"EHHHHHHH I don't know.  I give this place two stars because there is nothing special about the place.  Meats don't taste amazing good, and everyone in my party pretty much agreed that nothing would bring us back."}
{"text":"One of the first places we tried when we moved here. Its a yummy place. Fair priced for what you get, drink and FroYo included at lunch.  They offer papers to push you meat ect down so you can really pile the bowl high!! Very filling meal! The only thing I dislike is that you have to mix your own sauce!! This sucks when its busy and especially when you have small kiddos with you, it takes too much time! They need to have sauces pre mixed. Staff is friendly and its a very clean restaurant all the time. One of our faves nearby!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! You basically go through a line of vegetables, meats, noodles and sauces that you create yourself. At the end of the line a chef makes it on the grill in front of you. The noodle selection is great, ramen to rice noodles if you want them. You also get soup, rice and crispy noodles as sides. My hubby and I split the large bowl - which is 10.95 (this includes the drink too.) There is always enough for both. I think for kids, there is a yogurt machine too, never tried it. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is great - best of all, it's your creation and it's healthy. You can eat inside or out - nice place to eat before or after a movie - which is a few stores down."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite noodle spot near by!! If you haven't had it yet you're definitely missing out"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding!!! This place far exceeded my family's expectations and we will be back. So much food! It would be nice if they added a few more options such as egg. It's a must try.   The picture is of when our oldest daughter saw they grilled the food in front of the customers.   Our children loved this place!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday around 5pm and had the usual mix of deliciousness.. What was different this time was the amazing service by the management. I appreciate a place that takes pride in the customers happiness. My party left happy and full!"}
{"text":"Meh. I love YC's, normally, but this location sucked. They staff seemed pretty careless and didn't really know how to help patrons in their restaurant. They didn't pay any attention to the food bar either. My wife had to go grab an employee to let them know that a bunch of the food was out, including noodles, which is an essential part of YC's dining. It also wasn't very clean around the bar, at the drink station or in the restrooms. You would think that spending $50 would at least get you a clean place to eat. I won't be returning again and I'm pretty turned off from my normally weekly YC's visits as a whole."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! I love that you get to pack in as much veggies, meat, and noodles as you want. Then you can create a sauce combo to your liking. You take both bowls to the grill masters and they cook everything to perfection! During dinner, you can also get frozen yogurt for dessert. I'll definitely be back to try more combinations!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with out of town hungry friends due to its large portions and unique way the food is prepared. By choosing wisely one can even have a pretty healthy meal. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Good food, great price  and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times throughout my life and have always had a great experience. Today was different though, the service was exceptional! We were greated by Juliet with a big smile. She was very helpful. While getting our food ready she asked if we needed help and was very attentive to everyone in the restaurant. My girlfriend and I were so impressed by her kindess and hard work. I even had a conversation with a lady at the fountain drink station who was overwhelmed/ impressed by Juliets outstanding work ethic. Any employer should feel blessed to have her on their team! Thanks Girl! =)"}
{"text":"What an interesting place!  You get to pick all your toppings to be stir-fried.  Love all the veggie toppings!  You can even make your own sauce!  They have brown rice too!  If you pack it right, you will have more than enough food to take home.  Staff is super friendly and will help you navigate the process!"}
{"text":"First off...I'm not a big asian food fan as I have seafood allergies, but this place makes it simple to accomodate, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  This is the second time I've been to YC's when visiting the Phoenix area, and I highliy recommend it due to the fresh ingredients and cleanliness of the restaurant and super fiiendly staff.  You pile/cram your bowl full by selecting exactly what you like with choices of proteins and veggies, and they grill it all up for you.  The staff can help you select a sauce mix to your liking (accounting for your allergies and preferences).  The lunch/dinner deal is great in that it includes unlimited soup, rice and sodas, so you won't go away hungry."}
{"text":"I go here with my pals from my Camaro Car Club when we're at the Pavilions and its a great place to grab some grub and chow down. The staff is very friendly and they keep the place hopping. Good food for the price and the next thing you know you've got a hot plate of food and cooked in front of your very eyes. Way to go YC's! I'm definitely a fan that's for sure and look forward to seeing you again soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I normally go to the one in Tempe and now I remember why. We went there Tuesday and we should have left as soon as we walked in. The cashier had the worst attitude and was extremely rude. We notified her that my husband has a gluten allergy well of course when we get to the grill the cook was less than pleased that he had to clean the grill for my husband and gave us a dirty look. If you are going to serve potatoes you must at least part cook them because we all added them to our bowls and they were raw. The soups were cold and gross, the red pepper flakes were so old that they were no longer red, who knows how long it's been there for. Cleanliness is definitely not a priority here. Had a hard time finding a table because they were dirty. My husband and brother had the all you can eat. My brother completely lost his appetite on his second bowl. You could see burnt specs on it and it smelled burnt really bad. I tasted it and had to spit it out because it was so gross. When I told the manager he just proceeded to make excuses about how maybe the grill hadn't been cleaned or that maybe my brother had added too much sauce. Then he finally admitted that the cook must have poured water on the hot grill and it removed all the burnt on old sauce and now cooked it into my brothers food. Then when I tell him about how rude the cashier was and how each time she walks by our table she gave me a dirty look. He said well she's just a bit dry, I said no she was flat out rude. He said yeah well I guess I can mention it to her. I went back and have read countless reviews about the rude staff. Wonder why this location doesn't care about customer service. To top it off my husband got extremely sick surely from the cook doing a shitty job at cleaning the grill and from all the sauce cross contamination. Definitely will never be back at this location."}
{"text":"This location has a problem with raising the price and I don't see anything new being offered at all since I've been going here! Child size is now called small and only $1 less and the bowl size is exactly the same they even throw away anything that falls out of your bowl now. Anyways I wasn't very hungry and the orange haired skinny girl said I couldn't share my bowl with my bf and my dad was getting his own bowl. I've been going here forever this is the only time I ever wanted to share"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to have their own opinions about the sauce combinations. Not matter what combination of sauces I use it ALWAYS tastes the same. I have taken bites out of everybody's bowl at my table (with permission, or at least warning), all pretty much the same. Not a bad thing, just tastes like YC's. Other than that, all seems to have been said in the other 90 reviews  Go for lunch, fill up on wontons and soup while you're there, pony up $.50 for the ToGo Box and you get three good meals for $10. (But I do remember when I could ditch class at SCC and hit up that location for lunch for $5, but then again you could get a pack of smokes at that Chevron for just over $3 back then as well. Inflation sucks, YC's doesn't, Man I'm old)"}
{"text":"I love YC  a little expensive but you can make anything you want  so that makes it amazing. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what kind of sauces you will like. For example for me even the hottest sauces aren't hot enough for me. So I add extra spice to the sauce."}
{"text":"Visited the establishment in Gilbert recently and watched as a hostess explained to a gentleman their no sharing policy.  She came off super elitist and arrogant.  Was the owner an only child ? This policy is what is wrong with America.  Although at first I thought the guy she was talking to was going a little overboard with his harsh stance on why he hated their no sharing policy but now after thinking about it, I agree with him.  This place is awful and the employees who hide behind the policy with comments like \"I don't make the rules\" are just as contemptible."}
{"text":"I love this mongolian bbq...its my favorite one in arizona.  I have tried others and they never have the good variety of veggies, proteins or sauces like this place has...I do the combination everytime...I have tried other sauce combos and I always go back to my original way...I love to add the chili oil because I love spice...then I get some of the wontons.and dip them in siracha and hot mustard...yum yum yum...dont forget to use the wheat noodles they are the best!!! Always put extra sauce because your meal will come out dry if you dont.  They have rice and soup too, but I never get it because you get so much food! You get to have frozen yogurt after and its perfect because you get a little sweet at the end.  I love it...i just wish it were closer to my house but I will make the drive..."}
{"text":"Lots of food for the price!  Flavor is average, but you can customize it to what you like. I've tried a lot of different flavors but they don't seem to stick to the ingredients so the bowl tastes dry until you get to the bottom where your sauce made a soup..."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get this feeling that it is a good thing to overpopulate a bowl of frozen meat shavings, then add a handful of veggies and top it off with my own improvised blend of sauce ingredients. (Yes there is recipes on the wall, but I always screw up.) I will say up front that this is a franchise, and I really dont like franchises.   /The good They encourage the attempts to increase the maximum fill-level, by patrons own ingenuity,  of the designated bowl. I like that you can make your own sauce, and they have plenty of ingredients.  You don't have to fit rice in the bowl, that you grab afterward.. as much as you want.  /The bad I can't say that there is anything directly bad about this place. If you have walked in here, you know what a mongolian grill is and then you have accepted the terms of the procedure.    /The unexpected The price includes a drink, rice and questionable frozen yogurt (and unlimited refills thereof), but you have to pay 50c for a classic to-go american-asian doggy bag.   Stay classy YC..  .. und das ist nach der karnivor kritiker"}
{"text":"You can make your own bowl! Lots of veggies, different meats, noodles, 2 broths, white or brown rice and they cook the food for you! You choose the sauces! It is a big bowl too for $14 unlimited! Pretty damn good :)"}
{"text":"Awesome!  we rarely go out for dinner so this was an extra great treat as our 2 sons loved watching the chef cook their selection of fresh meat and veggies.  The chefs were very kind and talked to us while they cooked our dinner.   The staff here is amazingly nice and super helpful!  We were so surprised on just how helpful and customer service oriented they were.   Simply a great place, great  food and excellent customer service at a very fair price!  We will tell others and be back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had only been to the Southern YC's location which was nice and the service excellent and this location was no different...excellent!!!     We like this location better as it's much bigger and a bit nicer.  The staff is friendly and VERY helpful!  I had a bit of a hard time with the sauce mixing since I can't have certain oils etc but they helped in every way to make sure it was still tasty.  When I had a question on an ingredient on their frozen yogurt, the manager went to get the package so I could check it out.   The checked on us  throughout our dinner to make sure all was good which is unusual so yes, this place and it's management and staff deserve 5 stars!!!   We will be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Our first time, and we felt very welcomed!  Kristen was so helpful, she went above and beyond!  Perfect spot to take a College student...the leftovers will be welcomed!  Liked all the choices, and that everything was covered in the price!"}
{"text":"Usually really nice. I guess weekdays are when the losers that don't care about anything work. All the veggies looked like they were almost rotten. Then when I ask for some fresh cilantro they take 10 minutes to beat the fresh cilantro with a dull knife. You could see where they hit it with the knife and it didn't cut through. And you could tell that they were smashing it with there hand while they were cutting it because all of the leaves had the juice coming out of them."}
{"text":"Much better food and experience compared to Tempe. I mean I shouldn't be surprised that Scottsdale is better than Tempe. But this place is really good."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and every time we've gone the same cashier is there and she is super nice! My daughter loves building her own bowl. The iced tea is awesome also!!  Very clean, fresh, and friendly."}
{"text":"This location is very old, but seems clean.  The staff kept playing around in the back while we waited for a cook and hostess.  Food is good, but a small bowl at dinner would lift your score...a large bowl is too much food, or you pay for air."}
{"text":"I've eaten at YC's over the years and was so excited when this location opened.  This location has a great bright dining area.  The manager is REALLY friendly and helpful and the place is always clean.  If you have not eaten here, you are in for a surprise.  First, just get into it and have some fun.  You need to SMASH the meat down ALOT because it cooks down.  Have some fun with the sauces!  Now that I've moved to SoCal I do miss this place.  YC's is MUCH better than the mongolian grills in SoCal."}
{"text":"Since I am an avid fan of the pavillions car show I go to ycs and have for over 6 yrs.  let me explain why you see an update from 6 months or a year ago the and one from 6 months before that.   I've been involve in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years in one capacity or another.  I also have been trained in the old school French ssicsl fine dining so I know a little about more than just being a foody.      You don't go to ycs  for a sit down dining type abiance. It is the food yet also everything that incorporates good fun and a great Experiance.    Servers?  Well not exactically,  but they will help you make decisions based on what you tell them you like in flavoreds or spices they aren't afraid to point you in a direction it's your choice to take it.      The food is cold and fresh and dated on the Cambros they use for storage.  They will scrape the circular grill if requested and usually do on a repeats basis.  Stack the food high and lots.   It will shrink as cooked. But Personally I use a small soup bowl for my ladles of sauces.   I have never been disappointed with any other people here.   Employees and guests alike.  Good food.  Fun atmosphere and above all else.  Consistancy.  Good.  Logistically you Don't have a place they does the business they do with out being above average.  There's just to many other restaurants to go to in the area if the wee just average  I see reviews here like..its too loud.  Not healthy etc.  yes moderation is the key.  Case and points. I will sometime's not use any sauces or noodles.  I pile on chx and spinach and veg with some ginger and garlic and it's awesome and for 10.00 I can eat for two days."}
{"text":"Poor selection of meats. Noodles are terrible. Disappointing for Mongolian. I would not return."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  There is an art to making the perfect dish: just copy the person in front of you and adjust to your taste preferences.  Making the right sauce is key.  There are several YC's across the valley but this one is the best."}
{"text":"Best mongolian bbq In the valley. It is what you make of it. Literally."}
{"text":"It's simple: if you love Mongolian BBQ, you'll love this place. It's delicious. The quality is always top notch, and with the ability to create many dishes from the various ingredients, it's entirely possible to never have the same meal twice. Plus, I can get the big bowl, eat my meal, and take the rest home for another meal or two later on. That's a definite win."}
{"text":"YC's is the best Mongolian BBQ restaurant on this side of the valley.  Yes the meats are shaved and frozen, but that never really bothered me when I used to eat meat.  To tell the truth the other places that don't have super cold meat kind of freak me out.  The staff at this location are always really nice and help out all the new new people who have never been before.  I have taken several friends when they come from out of town and they always think it's a cool place.  The lunch bar is pretty great and always quick and fresh to get in and out of for me. For Dinner they have more options which is kinda cool, but disappointing since I always go for lunch. I'm not sure how many different combos there are for sauce, but there ate several boards listing all the combos.  They all seem to taste similar though no matter how I mix them up.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The standard menu includes rice, soup, and desert ( FROYO like Ice Cream ) which is a fairly good deal.  I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I love their service! They teach you how to press and stack up the food in one bowl and they will even make the favor for you. Very nice healthy bowl of stir fry food customized by you!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends after finishing our finals in last spring semester at ASU down the street. The food was bomb diggity. I was introduced to it from one of the guys on our team. I go there regularly now"}
{"text":"With its drab exterior and tinted windows, it's only natural to think that YC's is closed. But this is a dining experience you don't want to miss. Once inside, you are met with a charming, buffet-styled line of meats/fish, veggies, and sauce followed immediately by two large grills where your food is cooked in front of you. Portion sizes are as big or small as you make them, but YC's encourages \"packing\" your bowl to maximize value.  If you're a YC's virgin, feel free to follow one of the sauce recipes written in chalk above the grilling area. They are well-proportioned and achieve the intended style. But make no mistake: improvising with various combinations and proportions on your own is what YC's is all about. You are not here to order food; you are here to design it.   If you are visiting the East Valley and want a unique, hands-on dining experience, YC's Mongolian Grill is a fun and challenging option. It does one thing, and it does it well! Two minor complaints: there is no option to buy a small bowl during dinner hours; and, take-out bags cost an additional $0.50."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong..  Fresh choices of frozen meats including pork, chicken (white and dark,) beef, and sometimes fish depending on what time you go.  Pile on that huge choices of fresh vegetables.  Add to that the many choices of dry spices and sauces.  Give your dish to cook and he grills it over a big grill.  You control the portion. You control the ingriedients. You control the flavor.   $10.75 which includes drink.  If you want unlimited, its $12.75.    Its clean, fresh and tasty.   Yes, everything gets mixed together.  So if you are a person that needs your meal separated into sections, this is not the place for you.   Want a nice change and fresh hot bowl, stop by.  This is a gem that I had forgotten about until I was reminded recently by a friend.  And now it will soon become my regular."}
{"text":"YCs if the food didn't taste well you seasoned it wrong. How can you not love this place."}
{"text":"We decided to give a different YC's a try & had a very pleasant experience. It was a week night that we went & it wasn't very busy in the restaurant. We were promptly welcomed in & got started through the line. The item buffet was clean & well-maintained which was very pleasing. Obviously as it wasn't too busy, we got our food very quickly & were ready to eat.  The price includes a bowl of food along with some other items such as soup & ice-cream. I opted to get the chicken & vegetable soup (not sure what the official name is but it was chicken & vegetables in broth ... tasted like chicken noodle without the noodles) .. It was kept warm & tasted good. The bowl was also good. It was my fault that I didn't put enough sauce in the bowl so there was some water sprayed on my food to cook it. I guess my only complaint was that the sauce flavors didn't come through as a result of that, but I still enjoyed the meal.  We will be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely one of our favorites! We come here about once a month and fill up on our own creations and soft serve. We always have leftovers; like two meals worth of leftovers so although not cheap, it ends up working out in the end. I have one complaint but it doesn't change my rating. I've been coming for years with my son and never thought to look at the menu because there are only (I thought) two sizes. Turns out they have a kids bowl that is a fraction of the price and no one has ever mentioned it. Even tonight they asked if he wanted a small or large and I had to ask for the kid bowl. It should be offered for kids by default. Other than that the staff is friendly and keep the place nice and tidy."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. good value. Manager asked if everything was good several times which was a pleasant surprise nowadays. Will be back"}
{"text":"I like this place because the service is great - they have always had friendly, helpful, and accommodating employees (always ready to teach you about how it works and help you with everything, even mixing your own sauce blends) AND I like that I can eat as many vegetables as I want (I love stir-fried/sauted vegetables!);  The prices are good, considering what you get (I skip the soup and rice, even though it's included.. and I don't drink anything but water, so that kinda is a waste for me).  Note that although I opt for hormone free chicken and beef when I grocery shop and go out to eat (when available), I understand that this place may not have the highest quality protein ingredients.. but in the world of carb-centric burgers, sandwiches, and even salads, I like that I can go here and get a ton of vegetables and some chicken (likely Tie-son brand and pumped-up.. yes, i'm spelling it wrong on purpose) or (farm raised) fish if I'm in a crunch for time and just need something non-carb-centric with lean proteins...ergo the 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the Staples parking lot, looking for somewhere to eat.  I popped up my trusty Yelp app and found this place, about 30 feet from where I was parked.  It's pretty unassuming from outside, but what an amazing dining experience.  Not only is the food amazing (well, of course--you make it exactly how you like it!) but the portions are such that you should be able to get two meals out of it.  In general, this is a healthy alternative to fast food and an eating experience that your whole family will enjoy.  We plan to take our out of town guests here when they come to visit."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here for dinner as I'm a fan of this kind of food & being able to control what you put together is nice.  This place seemed clean & the food line was somewhat maintained. The meat & veggies were full, but some of the sauces didn't have any anything in the containers. Also, I found it was really odd that someone had accidentally put the sesame oil bottle in one of the sauces & the person who worked there pulled the bottle out and left both the sauce in the container and left the bottle with the sauce all over the bottle. I'm not sure why they both weren't removed.  As for the food itself, it wasn't bad. The price of the meal includes one bowl in line, unlimited soup & rice, a drink, & ice-cream. I only tried the chicken wonton soup which wasn't bad ... Nothing special & it was cold as it was just sitting there. The bowl was good but considering that I didn't get much of the other things, it seemed pretty high in price. Also, I think it doesn't make much sense to charge extra for a to-go box. I've paid for my meal, why not give me a box since I only went through the line once?  Overall, not a bad experience, just not anything that would compel me to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Food tastes very good. But, the last three times I went, I had diarrhea every time. It's sad that it took me three times to remember that I can't go back anymore. Last night, my husband had same problem. I don't know why. Something is not sanitary there."}
{"text":"Wish I can give 4.5 stars. I went there with my bf on Friday and since we both have a gluten sensitivity (not allergic) they were nice enough to make me a gluten free version of the Mongolian sauce using a gf soy sauce. It was a bit salty but the next time I go I'm gonna try another"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live here in AZ and we would frequent YC's!  We absolutely love it. Now that we don't live here anymore, we miss it as there is nothing similar in Eastern PA where we live. Whenever we come visit, this is one of our must stop places.  I love the chef's favorite sauce, the veggies are so fresh and the rice noodles are the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is excellent, and the DIY style is a cool idea. The only interaction you have with staff is the host at the front and maybe the cooks if you choose to so service is kind of a non issue. They need to add to go cups for drinks though, and don't up charge like they do for to go boxes for food."}
{"text":"Service is good, the servers keep cleaning the table and refilling food. The price includes drink and ice-cream. My hubby likes this place because he paid 1 dollar more to get unlimited bowl. Food taste fairly good."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's one of my favorite places around. Realitively healthy and you are in control of exactly what you want. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I love this place! For about $12 you get a huge custom meal with a drink, ice cream, soup, rice, and wontons if you want them. The flavor combinations are basically endless, so you get exactly what you're in the mood for. Tip: Take-out containers are $0.50 so bring some change because you'll want to save room for ice cream"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I probably eat here more than I do at home, really.  I prefer white meat chicken at lunch / fish at dinner, sprouts, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, white and green onions, baby corn, and noodles.  I make my own sauce (same one for about 15 years now) using yc's own, spicy hunan, ginger, garlic, and chili oil.  Then they grill it up and serve it hot. I like to add fresh cilantro, jalapenos, and peanuts after they finish cooking it..  They have really nice spicy beef soup.  I wash it down with a iced tea.  Its a guilt free meal really, great staff, locally owned, clean place that I highly recommend.  I go to all the locations, but this one most often."}
{"text":"Edit: the owner called me and was truly apologetic and has made things right. I'll update when I go back. I truest love YC's and the food is amazing. Hoping that it was just a one time thing.      My hubby and I are here the other night. Normally this place is great and I would give 5 stars. But this time both of our food has made us sick. I have a while to go box I can't eat and $30 down the drain. Very disappointing. Service was crappy and the food making us sick has made us not want to go back to this location."}
{"text":"For about $12 you get a huge portion of customized stir fry and fountain drink for lunch. You can put as much frozen, raw slices of meat and veggies as you want into your bowl and they cook it for you on a large, flat circular grill. The wait is usually no more than 8-10 minutes. YC's is excellent. I've visited many times over the years around the holidays. I usually eat as much as I can at the restaurant and when I fail to eat it all, I buy a to-go container for $0.50 for the leftovers.  It's too bad they haven't resolved the whole sharing or to-go issue after two decades. I'm sad to hear that the employees have been rude and/or confrontational to customers - especially to those who have kids that simply don't eat very much or to people who have much better portion control than myself. They've never been rude to us.  I've never gotten sick (I feel for those who have gotten seriously ill). I think they do a good job with keeping the meat shavings/rolls frozen at a safe temperature. It's seriously the best looking meat selection I've seen at Mongolian Grill places. Depending on who goes before you in the line, the veggies and sauce can get really messy. I've spilled sauces and dropped veggies all over the counter. Usually, the employees are quick to wipe the counters clean. For food safety reasons, remember to get a sheet or two of the wax paper at the beginning of the line. One to push down the raw meat in your bowl. And another sheet to push down your veggies. And please don't let the veggie tongs or your own fingers come into contact with the contents of your bowl.  Make sure you wash your hands before eating if you are especially susceptible to food illness.  I agree with another reviewer's comment that the hot and sour soup was weak. I feel like it has been better in past years. The rice is so-so. The crispy wonton strips are nice crunchy addition to either your soup or stir fry.  Don't forget to check out the cilantro, peanuts, and other toppings right before you give over your bowl to the cooks.  If you have any food allergies, like a peanut allergy, then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I've spent years out in other states devouring their takes on Mongolian BBQ, and yet for some reason YC's takes the cake. Everywhere I've gone defaulted to an AYCE style, so color me surprised when the best I've had was largely single order/take out.  If you aren't familiar with the format, you prepay for either a small or large bowl, so you don't have to worry about check at the end. You start with sliced meats, that they graciously provide paper to smash it all down and maximize space. You can dry spice if you want, then follow up with plenty of vegetables. What impressed me about YC's is the option of multiple noodles - after dozens of iterations, this is the only one with anything outside egg noodles - and the udon, rice, and wheat are all kickass! Then you finish off your sauce mixture in a separate bowl and you're off to the races.  I've tried the all you can eat out of habit a couple times, and I've found it not worth it. The norm is basically stacking your bowl as high as physically possible, with some of the most impressive bowls over twice the height you start with! When you get a quick stir fry from a bowl that big, with rice, soup, wontons, and ice cream at dinner, a large is actually ridiculously filling.  Not only am I a fan of their wheat noodles, but their sauce selection is straight up the best. With options like lemongrass, black pepper sauce, and Spicy Hunan on top of your regular selection, you can create something that can hit pretty much any flavor palate.   When all my friends in high school kept inviting me to go to YC's, I passed out of sheer ignorance. Never again will I give up a chance at some of the best tasting and valued Asian food in Scottsdale period."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of YC's Mongolian BBQ and usually go to the Chandler/Gilbert locations. My husband and our two kids came here on Father's day 2016 due to the proximity to where we were shopping at the time. I immediately noticed that this building was in serious need of some work. The back section looked like it was falling apart and frankly, was pretty gross to look out the dingy faded windows. The customer service was very poor, employees looked like they didn't want to be there, nobody was pleasant, and it was contagious. Usually when I go to the other locations I can taste the flavor of the sauce that I made in my food, in this case, all of our food tasted the same, regardless of which sauce recipe we used. It was a pretty depressing experience and I do not plan on going back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I got violently ill,  and so did my sister.    The staff is incredibly nice but I can't subject myself to that again.."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Employees were super helpful, they made sure everything was fresh and stocked and everything looked super clean!!  The employees helped me pick a sauce that I would like without confusion. There was no wait and was very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen,Boys and Girls when you go to YC's Mongolian Grill bring your feed bag on.This place has several  bowl sizes.to fill up your meats,fish and veggies up to the rim and beyond.. You add your own sauces and condiments the amount to your liking.. You can either add noodles to be cooked or there is white or brown rice already cooked. You can have all the soda you want and for desert they have frozen yogurt. I saw a man make a root beer float with the frozen yogurt.. It looked outstanding.I you want value and a great Mongolian meal, dash on over to YC;s."}
{"text":"I drive from north Phoenix all the way to this location (about 12 miles), it's that good. I probably go 2-3 times a month with friends. At first I thought the price was high, but when you see what you can fit into a small/large metal bowl, it's amazing and worth it. I usually go with the tons of wheat noodles and make my \"Chef's favorite\" sauce with a couple tweaks of my own. The fried wontons are amazing as well as the brown rice option."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. One of my trips to YC'S was almost a disaster for me because I decided to experiment with my sauces and accidentally made my sauce too hot for me to eat. When the server walked by she asked how the food was and I hesitantly said \"it's really spicy\" and she immediately offered me another metal bowl to make start a new dish. I was eternally grateful because my food would have gone to waste and I hate wasting Ycs or anything really. Definitely gonna continue to love these guys :)"}
{"text":"One word for YC's - Delicious!  That's partly because you pick your own ingredients and sauces, and you can really heap the food on in the small bowl.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always a great lunch and plenty of food.  I have always liked playing with my food and experimenting with all their different sauces is cool.  No disaster combinations yet but I am sure I could find one if I tried hard enough... there is tons of variety.  If the dining room was less cafeteria I would go 5 stars, but they do a great job for the niche they are in.    Service is usually pretty fast, staff is nice, I like watching them grill up my meal, and of course, who can complain about a free ice cream cone on the way back to work?  Two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for good Chinese food and have been very disappointed until now. YC's is great! You are able to create your dish with your favorite ingredients and leave out anything that you dont like. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, especially if it is your first time to the grill. Picking out the ingredients is simple mixing the sauce to your taste can come with a bit of a learning curve but our hostess walked us thru the entire process. There is a recipe chart above the sauce mixing area which gives you guidelines to different sauces. My wife and I found it fun and great tasting with tons of fresh vegetable and meat choices to choose from. Great experience, YC's is now our favorite place to get Chinese food!"}
{"text":"A few years ago, I probably would have given YC's 5 stars.  I like their food, and the service for me has been consistently excellent.  However, I am so tired of the owner raising his prices in 50 cent increments.  I feel like they are the post office raising the price on stamps.  He has done this so much, that I really don't think YC's is as good a deal as it once was.  They also changed from Coke products to Pepsi products after 20 years--bad move in my opinion.  One of the workers told me that they have already heard complaints about this from several of their customers.  Yes, I will continue to go, but not nearly as much."}
{"text":"So this is a follow up to my visit on 01/09/2018**  I went back to this establishment on 01/24/2018 around 4:00pm to give what had been one of my absolute favorite places to stop for a bite to eat another shot.   First and foremost I was greeted like I usually am by not one but two different hello and welcomes from the staff working that day. Julieta was the one that met me at the counter and as I have read in previous reviews her kindness and absolute professionalism was impeccable. Upon a brief conversation about my last visits she was very thoughtful and considerate and really went far above any customer service I had ever received at any establishment like this.  She really honestly made me feel like a valued customer and I honestly couldn't speak higher about the customer service she provided.    When I got to the food prep grill with my bowl in hand the cook greeted me with a kind hello and the issues I had the last two times were absolutely not at all present this time. The cook was very attentive with the food he was preparing,nothing was lost or wasted in prep, I honestly could tell the effort was being made. A tray was provided to allow me to move everything to a table, and of course the food upon completion was exceptional.   Everything about this visit was incredible and I could tell that all my issues previously had been addressed in a professional and timely manner. I highly,highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop in for lunch. It can be a bit busy and if your appetite is huge, you might want to opt for the unlimited trips option.   The secret is to Smush. Use the wax paper to fit everything in your tiny little bowl. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit - it was a fun concept and the staff was very nice. You create your own stir fry by choosing the meat, noodles, vegetables and sauce that you want and put it in a bowl. The chef then cooks it right in front of you. You can choose to eat there or take it to go. Note, they charge extra for to-go boxes, but I wanted to eat in the comfort of my own home. Good tasted good (not great) but overall I enjoyed it - until I got sick. Before that happened I had enjoyed my experience but now I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely cafeteria ambience, but WOW what fun. Bring cash for tips, they really earn them, and to go boxes are 50 cents. You'll need one. Yum"}
{"text":"My MIL's boyfriend took us here to meet up with some of his local family when they were in town. I didn't know what to expect walking in at all, and actually almost didn't come (we had some deliveries scheduled that day, but they finished early), and I'm so glad I made it! Others have described the process, and they're right. It is very tasty, but I did struggle with making my sauce, I didn't think the ingredients available were labeled very well. The employee helped me out and made the sauce I wanted though. I will say the beef was better than the chicken (in my opinion at least) so I'll be sticking with that next time."}
{"text":"YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.  YC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.  Chances are good you'll end up with enough leftovers for at least another meal or two.  Just don't forget, doggie bags are 50 cents a piece, so bring some quarters or singles."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and you are able to make the selections You desirel! Staff is always friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"This place is my most favorite place in Tempe ! The food is always great especially with the spicy Hunan sauce. The prices are great because you get plenty of food for under 12 bucks a person not to mention the restaurant is super clean as well as the restrooms which a lot of establishments seem to have a problem with  ....bottom line is that YC's is the spot!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and as always the portions are always big! This place is always \"poppin\" on Saturday nights. (The only nights I've ever gone) food is definitely good as far as how you prepare it. Easy concept, think of being in chipotle. It can get a little pricey but it's definitely worth giving a try maybe once."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here after we fight! It's actual therapy... we leave happy.  The food is incredible, the mood is nice and quiet, and you don't wait for ever..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and left a very happy and full customer! I will definitely be back. I wasn't sure how it all worked as far as getting food and other things but their staff was very friendly and more than happy to help. There food is extremely tasty compared to other Mongolian food restaurants that I have been to. I ordered the large bowl and what a mistake that was, in the best way possible! So much food for such a great price! I will definitely come back here! :)"}
{"text":"A-mazing! Love Mongolian, but this one is by far the best I've been to! Got to mix my own sauces too. Dinner comes with a drink, rice, soups and frozen yogurt! The staff was very personable and helpful. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Friendly service, clean and well-stocked. Must admit hubby had to talk me into coming, as we have had two negative experiences at other YC's locations. So glad I listened!   Great variety of vegetables, meats and sauces. Only wish they had snap peas and water chestnuts. Front end and cooking service is always speedy. Rolling highchairs for small kiddos as you move through the \"build your own bowl\" line. A large bowl always gives me leftovers. Sometimes they will charge $.50 for a to-go box and others, not so much. Wish they would always have both sides of the Mongolian bar open, especially during busy hours. We try to avoid the rushes noon-2 and 5-7."}
{"text":"Love love love this place such a variety of fresh vegetables and protein, . The sauces are flavorful and there is more than one for every palette. Great soup too!"}
{"text":"Well it's about time that I yelped about something already, it's been forever since I have!   Got here on my lunch break, and find it surprisingly similar to the mongolian grills that I've tried back in CA.. piling on the meats, veggies, sauces and such. I'm a little surprised to hear people review on this place that placing the ingredients in the bowl grosses them out, that's what a mongolian grill is, right? Oh well..  If you like to customize your food, this is the right place for you, but if you don't like getting messy with your hands, this is definitely not the place for you. Definitely liked the amount of choices in ingredients and sauces, the soup and drink that's included in the meal.. but the 50 cent charge per to-go box is pretty stupid. Staff is really friendly, bathrooms are clean, pretty spacious....  Overall it's decent, but will only come here if I am in the mood for lots of leftovers or willing to fork over $9 for lunch.."}
{"text":"I love YC's! It's a great place to go if you're looking for some delicious stir fry. Every time I come here I have a TON of left overs. The food is delicious, you literally customize your meal to how you want it. If you're ever in the neighborhood, give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"The cleanliness here is incredible. The staff are constantly working to wipe, stock, cook, check on customers, and help each other out. I have been to fine dining restaurants with service that couldn't compare. The food is fresh, and the options are plentiful. My husband and I went during the lunch rush today and, were in and out with full bellies in 45 minutes, AND we took our time. The prices are great, too."}
{"text":"The only reason it gets only two stars is because the young girl who works the cashier at night is honestly really rude. I was just there and she always has an attitude every time I go at night. The food is good, HER service is bad and is putting a bad name on the business. I'm not one to complain but she made that much of an impact...."}
{"text":"After speaking with the manager, Geoff, I had to update my review. Geoff was extremely kind and understanding regarding my previous visit to YC's. I haven't been back in to try things again but I'm confident our experience will be a positive one. Thank you to Geoff for your professional and friendly demeanor, it was a pleasure working with you."}
{"text":"First of what will be MANY visits!!  Delicious protein choices including Alaskan cod, huge selection of veggies, three kinds of noodles, brown and white rice, soups, sodas and iced tea, and don't forget the frozen yogurt!  Make your own version of meat and veggies with sauce designed by you. Very clean, very helpful workers, bright, clean, cheery - we will be back for this healthy eating option!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! It was our first time here and I gotta say, they had amazing service and the food was delicious! Big portion sizes with drink, rice, and soup included. I highly recommend this restaurant for an overall great experience! I approve."}
{"text":"I LOVE,LOVE, LOVE YC's.  I come from the midwest where we have HuHot's and its an all-you-can-eat, go up as many times as you want kinda place so I was a little weary when my friend said you only can go through once with your semi-small bowl.  Then she showed me the way with the packing papers and I must say I have become quite a pro at making monster stir-frys that last 2-3 meals worth.   I love YC's because: -Great selection of veggies, amazing selection of sauces and most are very low calorie.   -Extremely quick cooking time w/ friendly service -I love the whole grain options for noodles and brown rice. -I love that you get soup, wontons, rice, and drinks with your meal price.    Could improve with more protein selections, like seafood.  Not a big deal though.  I have gone here nearly once a week every since I first went here.  Its a great fast lunch place.  Every other mongolian grill place I've been to in the valley has not come close to comparing."}
{"text":"I remember when YC's was just one location where hungry ASU students could value it up on good fresh, you pick the ingredients and they do it up in the gigantic Wok! Really good back then and still good now with more locations! Great deal with what you get soup, rice, drinks and of course you can customize your sauce to your taste. Like you can ti curry with your noodles or spicy Thai garlic. You are only limited by your imagination. They also have a cheat board you can use to assist you in the selection of what sauces to use for your very own creation! I'm a fan and I approve of this review !!! Dinner or lunch you can't go wrong. Nice friendly staff will guide you through the ins and outs of Mongolian!!! Thanks YC !"}
{"text":"Food is always great and the line is very fresh. We visited last week and the staff was absolutely amazing. They offered to carry one of my trays as my hands were full (I have 3 kids). Walking through the line they offered to help with sauces and were constantly cleaning and refilling. This place is an amazing deal for what you pay and totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is very nice, and all of the food that is here is very delicious. If you've never done Mongolian BBQ before, YC's is the place to start and the time for starting is the present. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to go here on a whim. At first, I thought it was overpriced, but the food is fresh and i can pick what I want. The meat is frozen so no fear of food poisoning here. My one complaint is that I was unable to try the sauces. I chose the YC sauce. When I was done cooking, I couldn't believe how much it was. It was like it expanded on the grill. The brown rice was great and loved the won ton chips. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love YCs! Its build your own and I just don't understand how people blame ycs when THEIR MAKING THEIR OWN FOOD! Now with that said, I love the wheat noodles, the beef and chicken, and the mongolian sauce. The crispy chips are awesome on top of the bowl crumbled. It is a must to go..one because the foods good and two because its just a fun experience."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and nice. The food was also cooked quickly. The reason for my two star rating is simply the food is only worth two stars. I frequent restaurants in this food category and by far this place is the worst spot in the US I've eaten at. I was unimpressed with their sauces and their flavor on my stir fry/Mongolian BBQ. The food is very mediocre. However I will say for a cookie cutter restaurant and chain restaurant it was ok. Also stay far away from the soups. They were absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested YC's, as she has ate here before. I really like the make your own bowl. Staff was really helpful and explained how it all works, since it was my first time. They had a good selection of sodas & tea, and a ice cream station. Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price! We will be return with bigger appetite next time!  Oh and the complimentary ice cream bar never hurt anybody either! Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Just tried YC's for the first time and already know there will be a second and third times to come. The staff showed me how it worked and I was amazed at the selection and just how much food could fit in the large bowl. YC's is awesome!"}
{"text":"This one is fine. Good food, service, clean restaurant. What sucks about it is the customers that frequent this place. Super irritating. I'd go do a different location if I were you."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that after reading some of these negative reviews it just goes to show how lazy people are or Californized they have become.  I have frequented this place since 97' worked there when I was in high school washing dishes, and have seen how far the owner has taken his business and it just goes to show that Genghis Grill and all the others need to up their game.  Prices have gone up but lets look at the cost of living and gas and all of the things that we use as a daily need.  Still AWESOME SERVICE, Meat selection has grown a bit, veggies are still the same, and newest addition are the noodles and sauces.     6 ladles of YC's own, 3 of garlic, 3 of cooking wine, 4 of the orange sauce, 3 ginger, 2 cooking syrup, and 3 seconds of seasame oil. brings out a nice sweet taste with a bit of salty.  The saying goes you get what you pay for and I pay for a small bowl at lunch and turn it into 2 togo boxes.    Jeff keep up the good work, my family loves your place"}
{"text":"The crew here is great ! I've been dining at YC's since 2000. Now that I have children and 1 with a peanut allergy cross contamination is always on out alert when eating out, we asked the staff about any sauces or cross contamination and they helped us out.  I recommend any of the YC's Mongolian BBQ locations"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 20 years and it has always been fantastic. This has always been one of my favorites with amazing food and great service."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Been going to YC's since it started in Tempe back in the 90's.  Food is excellent and tasty.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This isnt the worst food I have ever tried but I definitly will NOT be going back there anytime soon.  I dont know how fresh the vegetables are but it is a good alternative to fast food.  The meat is frozen and kinda grossed me out so I recommend the tofu, although I cant speak for its quality.  The service was fast and you get to decide how much of each ingredient you want."}
{"text":"This was so good I wonder why Mongolian BBQ hasn't sprung up in every city (hint, hint Alabama!) When you go in you pay for either a small bowl ($9) or a large bowl ($10). I got the small bowl and still had enough left over for another meal.   The ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back.  Can I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!  There is also a small bar with soup and rice, but I wouldn't waste my time with those if I were you! The BBQ was delicious and fun to prepare!"}
{"text":"Not only do we love this place but all of our five kids do as well! fresh, hot and yummy Mongolian food cooked in front of you in minutes and I can say not only is the food great but the price for a family of seven is great!   Kids are charged by their age so for less then a happy meal the kids get chicken/beef or fish and noodles, soup and frozen yogurt with a drink. Lots of food for a great price"}
{"text":"The food is delightful.  Make sure if its your first time you ask for help. Use an extra bowl instead of the \"pushing paper\"   Food is always fresh and usually pretty high quality. I love the wheat noodles and creating my own sauces. The tofu is always delightful.   4 stars because the prices keep going up and up and up... And the bowls get smaller and smaller."}
{"text":"Great Concept!! The food was delicious and the customer service was great. I have never been to one of these before and the girl at the front gave me a quick run down of how it worked. Then another gentleman helped me at the sauce station by finding out what I liked and making it based off that. I will definitely be returning for more in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. I already left Tempe to go back to California, this was my last meal. When I do come back, I am definitely gonna come visit this place. I basically paid $9.50 for two meals! Though I was gonna board an airplane so I didn't wanna take any to go, so I finished it all :].  At first I was feeling a little uncomfortable, not really sure how to work this thing. It was my first time having this style of cuisine where I add my own ingredients. I read up on some reviews first and tried to get a glimpse of it, but watching those around me also helped. The wax paper is there for you to pack your ingredients in and make your money's worth. Great ingredients, fresh and healthy, then at the end you pick wheat noodles and/or rice noodles, I got both, and then you add a combination of any of the sauces you like. My bowl was towering 4 inches over the top with noodles, but some people were obviously even better at it with a bigger pile of noodles. There were a lot of yummy sounding sauces.. But I picked Spicy thai and thai peanut curry, mainly because those were the closest to me and were the least full (meaning someone had to have taken a lot, right?). I only got like 4.5 spoons of sauce, I definitely should have had more, maybe 7, it was pretty dry and I didn't have a pool of sauce at the bottom of my bowl like my brother did.   Keep waiting in line, and then when the chef calls you up, you just present your tray to them and they'll throw it on and cook it. There were also pineapple slices, peanuts, jalapenos, and such, but like i said, it was my first time and I get a bit uncomfortable at serve your self places, because I'm not entirely sure what I'm entitled to. Takes a quick 1-3 minutes to cook all your stuff, grab a table, or add some stuff to your tray.  They have self serve (all you can eat) brown or white rice, 2 choices of soup, which were pretty good, and some tortillas to add to your dish, which was a delightful addition. Also included in your $9.50 is a cup for soda/juice/tea, they even have blue powerade! My favorite, since I don't drink soda :). No tax so just throw a $10 at the host and you're good to go!. You can also tip the cooks if you'd like. Some people upgrade to the large, create a HUGE BOWL, and just take some to go. If you ask for it to go, the chef can easily fit a \"small\" into two chinese take out boxes. Imagine what a large could be fitted in.   The meal was DELICIOUS, I was STUFFED, however the brown rice could have been a little better, but other than that, I love this place and I can't wait to come back. Healthy eat for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Came in close to closing time but staff was still friendly, helpful and quick! The portion sizes are huge and I was able to leave with more the enough for lunch tomorrow. I also liked that they had a bunch of sauce recipes for the bowls so you aren't just going in blind; there are a ton of options! Although I did find it a tad odd that they charge .50 cents per to go box. Still worth it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and years and years and years. Until a few years back they only deserved a 4 star but they have upped their game and this is still my favorite Mongolian BBQ I have ever had. The staff is nice, the quality is good and the portions are HUGE! You cannot go wrong with going to YC's. One of my favorite fast dining options in AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing service. I'm not gonna say the mistake they made but I will say that they took care of me and completely owned up for the mistake and I left with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since I was 12 (29 now) and I  can't believe it's still open and still amazing. The cashier, Maria, was so polite and had the most amazing customer service. She was right there to help everyone, even with sauce options. She's a gem, keep her. Very happy to be back :)"}
{"text":"My husband LOVES this place. I think he could eat it every day. I have nothing bad to say about Mongolian Grill, but honestly, the whole \"build your own bowl\" thing is terrifying. I always feel like I'm going too slow for the people behind me, and I screw up my sauce every time. It gives me panic attacks. But I keep going because I'm not the only person in my family who eats. This is a LOT OF FOOD- endless noodles, meat and veggies, a soup, rice and chip bar, fill your own fountain drinks and teas, and an ice cream cone station- for an awesome price. It's one of those places where I feel like my bowl is replenishing itself while I eat, it just never gets smaller. Make sure you pay that extra 50cents for a to-go box, because you'll need it. The staff is so nice and they make sure the restaurant is clean and everything is well stocked. Overall and despite my issues with sauce and personal space in food lines, I have to give them 5 stars. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Returned for a 2nd try - though went to the Southern & McClintock location this time.  Had a much better experience - staff was more helpful, offering to mix a sauce to my liking and resulting in a dish was very tasty. Didn't notice the dry spices that seemed to be new to the staff last year. Overall I've raised my rating for YC's from between 2 & 3 stars, to between 3 & 4 stars, leaning toward 4 stars.   Positives about YC's over their competitors: providing a larger bowl for ingredients, unlimited rice & soup, drink & desert included with meal (dinner menu). Negatives (in comparison to my favorite Mongolian grill): a smaller variety of ingredients, and having frozen sliced proteins rather than diced unfrozen proteins."}
{"text":"I asked a CSR at Home Depot where I should eat and he tells me \"you've got to try this Mongolian BBQ next door.\" I'm a little skeptical, but it was late and I was starving so I thought \"what the heck\".  What a pleasant surprise! I was greeted by the friendliest hostess who explained the whole concept to me. So as I go to pay, I tell her I'd like a soda with it and she tells me soup, rice, entree, bevarage and dessert are included for $10! Oh my gosh, what a deal!  She then walked me through the whole process right to the point of handing my concoction to the fellow that was going to cook it. Unlike what I had anticipated, she encouraged me to add MORE stuff... she wanted to make sure I got enough to eat.  I mixed it all with the Calcutta Curry and it came out great. Be careful though, the first several bites are steaming hot! Flavor was very good and I was a happy camper. The Manager, Peter (very nice guy), took time to sit with me and talk about the concept and make sure I was happy with my meal.  All in all I would really recommend trying this. Such a great concept, plentiful and good food, priced right and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Last night me and my lady went out to hit up a Mexican restaurant but we saw the line and kept on driving with no destination in sight. We happened upon YC's as there was a Taco shop nearby without a soul in the place so we decided to pass on the Taco's because no people in a restaurant scares the hell out of me.   We enter and a nice host explains to us how it works, we grab our metal looking dog bowls and proceed down the food line adding our raw goodies such as meats, sauce, veggies, noodles and the like. Smash it down smash it down, get as much in as possible into your doggie bowl!   We handed our bowls to the cooks and within a minute or two voila!, we had our tasty meals ready to go. Grab your own drinks, some rice and soup also if you like and enjoy your meal. Price was $13 or so for a large bowl, a couple dollars cheaper for a small. The large bowl I polished off with no problems and was nice and full while my girlfriend ate about half so you do the math. Will go back again most certainly and will try to smash it down even more. Yummy Chow!"}
{"text":"My bff Mike and I went here for dinner one week night a few months back, and we hit the doors pretty close to closing time. So close that we thought for sure we would be turned away. BUT the sweet young lady was more than happy to have us come in! I had never been there so I wasn't really sure what to do except shove all the stuff I liked into a bowl as high as I could make it! Then when I hit the sauce bar I got a glazed look over my eyes and some nice fella just popped up asking if he could be of service. He explained that he was a sauce specialist...we talked about every sauce and he made some recommendations off of the feedback I gave and started spooning stuff into a bowl. We took it to the cook guy and he stirred and sauted my goodies until they were properly cooked and put it back in a bowl. It was really yummy! And I can't wait to go back!!! Get a doggie dish because you will need it!!"}
{"text":"My friend KP loves this restaurant.  ...he's the guy who can clap 12 times in one second. Very impressive.   Anyway, he knows a thing or two about Mongolian Grill, and I have to agree with him on this one.   What's not to like about YC's? Who would hate on this place?  Affordable, tastey, comfortable, fast.   That KP clearly know what he's talking about."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food at a great price. A quick and easy meal that keeps everyone in the family happy. The ice cream machine was a nice little bonus! The location wasn't great, in the middle of a strip mall with nothing to really offer before or after the meal."}
{"text":"Great service, fun place to eat and the food is delicious. Really like the fact that you can customize your choices!"}
{"text":"I love stir fry, and I must say, the staff here are super friendly and helpful, but this restaurant is unique. It's like buffet style stir fry, except you only get to go to the buffet once. And if you don't know that your bowl needs to be super filled and overflowing with the ingredients, it cooks up into just a very small dinner. Also, don't forget sauce, or sesame oil, or both, or it cooks wrong, because they only cook it with water.... however, if you follow the recipe screen, you could put it together nicely. Overall, the restaurant is not very clean, the tables were all super dirty and I had to clean ours with baby wipes. The baby seats roll and are not cleaned-- so moms beware. There is an ice cream machine, and it's included... so it got 2 stars from ice cream machine and eclectic restaurant idea."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Mongolian Grill, this one is delish! Besides the typical meat, vegetable, and noodle choices, they also have a soup that is served with the food! It is spotless and clean here, and they are quick with their chop chop and don't water down the sauces, so everything has a good flavor. On the weekends there is always a car show out in the parking lot so it's a really great place to visit! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here a few times for lunch because it was close to my work and my co-workers pick it. I wish they have fish for lunch... but they don't offer fish for lunch only dinner. I never get my sauce game right, it's drowning my noodles."}
{"text":"There customer service is amazing. The young lady (Eileen) was super nice and answered our questions and offered assistance if we needed anything. Also Julieta was very helpful and approachable. Both the young ladies were on top of everything and took our dishes away quickly when we were done eating. My husband and I will definitely come back. Thanks YC'S for the great costumer service and food."}
{"text":"Pack a ton of meat down in the bowl using the tissue paper they supply. Pile veggies as high as you possibly can. Use double the amount of sauces recommended for the recipes. I skip the noodles, why pay for them to cook filler when there's free brown rice available POST GRILL? With this method even after stuffing yourself you should have enough leftovers for rougly 3 more meals."}
{"text":"Defiantly come here when you want leftovers for a few days. As a vegetarian its veggie heaven but the tofu looked very sickly like they dumped it from a can without draining it... So skip that and go right to the veggies where there's a huge selection.(and it looked and tasted fresh!)  As for the sauces always always always double up whichever recipe you choose or you wont taste it and it'll be very bland. The guy who cooked it was rude... But the food was good ill come back for that"}
{"text":"I went here a long time ago back in early early 2011. I have to say it was nice. The food was fresh and tasted good. They had a frozen yogurt machine that was good but some of the food was surprising because they had few selections of sauces and didn't have enough selections of rice and noodles like I wanted. The place was clean and welcoming staff which was nice but some specific selections were low and few sides."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mongolian grill!! Low prices and a great amount of food!"}
{"text":"Went back to YC's. Bar was full! I was also suprised with all the new veggies they added to their menu. The staff was very attentive as I had a disabled friend with me. They helped with her food and helped me with her seating.  YC's did respond to an earlier poor review I did. Their meat bar was practically empty. But this time their bar was full, it had additional new items, and I got assistance with my disabled friend. I appreciate the fact they offered assistance (I didn't have to ask). That was a big deal."}
{"text":"I've been a long time Ycs customer, and today was my first time going to this location and it easily just became my favorite. The staff here is super friendly and the place was very clean, will be returning!"}
{"text":"so good and lots of varieties to put in your bowl. all you can eat soup, rice and crackers with refill drinks. very well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, but this place is terrible.  I had heard my friends raving about it for awhile, but finally had the, uh, \"opportunity\" to try it out myself.  When I first walked in, I noticed it was just $9 for a big bowl, far cheaper than what I'm used to paying at Genghis Grill.  Sounds good, right?  Well, when I got to the food selections, I noticed a few things.  First, the meat was frozen. Second, there are only four meat options (frozen chicken, frozen beef, frozen turkey, and frozen pork).  Third, the vegetable selection is limited.  You'll have your lettuce, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, and bean sprouts, but there's not much more.  No eggs, baby corn, or anything else that might be interesting.  Oh, and no dry seasonings.  The sauces were encouraging.  I liked the idea of mixing and matching the different components.  After I tasted my food, however, backtracked on the sauce.  My bowl was quite soupy, but very bland.  The sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever.  Now I know why they provide that hot mustard... You need it if you want to actually taste something.  The portions were great, but I didn't even finish mine because it was just a bland, soupy mess of frozen garbage.  I think I'll spend the few extra bucks on Genghis."}
{"text":"First time going here. It was a nice experience making your bowl is pretty much a balancing act, but the veggies weren't cooked all the way although the noodles and sauce were pretty hot. I enjoy the unlimited rice, soup and drinks. The staff were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I live in Northern Virginia and whenever I visit the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I make visiting this restaurant a priority.  The food is delicious and very reasonable priced, especially compared to Genghis Grill.  The food and the recipes at YC's are significantly better than Genghis.  I believe for $9.95 (1 big bowl), don't quote me on the price, you get the entree with rice, noodles, soup, drink, and ice cream.  Even it is a dollar more, you will not be disappointed.  Looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix!  06"}
{"text":"Just come here! You won't regret it.  Make your own stir fry. Fresh meats and veggies cooked to perfection in your own concoction of savory sauce.  Also enjoy unlimited beverage, rice, and soup.  Hands down the best choice for mongolian grill!"}
{"text":"What more is there to say:    Meat = Good! Vegetables = Good! Noodles = Good! Sauce = Good! Soup = Good! Rice = Good!  Makes for one fat & happy Asian!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for Lunch. At first I had no idea why my friends were telling me to pack the meat so tightly into the bowl. I soon found out when we got to the huge scorching hott metal \"grill? wok?\" whatever it is my food came out delicious. The portions you get for 7 or 8 bucks are colossal! I'm talking Lunch, Dinner and a late night snack.......MMMM good"}
{"text":"One word: Basic. I tried Pei Wei's recently and the dish I ordered tasted just like the one I threw together at YC's. Okay, I know know that this is \"Asian fusion\" but that's all I am coming across in the valley. A whole bunch of \"fusion\" food. Give me authentic. Give me something that doesn't taste like all the chain restaurants around the area. I would have liked to have seen some baby corn, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts available as veggies to add to your dish here. In the meantime I will continue my search for good Asian cuisine around the area that doesn't taste like a microwaveable meal from the grocery store."}
{"text":"First time at this YC's in Tempe. I've been to a couple others in the valley with mixed success. This location seemed different, in a good way.   The hostess asked if I'd been there before, to which I said: 'No'. She explains how a buffet works and then went thru an example meal with me. Very nice service.   As I made my way thru the line, what she had said made perfect sense. This location offered small sheets of paper to 'squash down' the bowl, so you can fit more. Never saw that at the other locations.   The meats were frozen but shaved thin so they cook up on the hot table. You the fill your bowl with whatever you can fit, sauce it to taste and then hand it to the cook, who pours it all out onto his hot table, cooks it and then returns it to you in a fresh bowl.  They offered chopped nuts for finish, something the other locations didn't have. The entire staff was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The spicy beef soup was okay but I would've liked to add some vinegar. Very good meal tho.   The overall experience and value at YC's was excellent and I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place is so good I would drive 50 miles to get there every week.  Fortunately, it is only about 10 miles for me.  Try it and you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"WOW this place is awesome!!!!!!  Good Healthy choices.  Cooked up exactly the way I want it with ingredients I pick and choose from!!! We will be regulars at this place from now on ( and we won't have to break the bank to go often)."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Clean, friendly and above all yummy!!! They are always busy but always super fast. Responsibly priced and you get so much! My fiancée and I come about once a week, and have brought many people from out of town who have all loved it."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last few years, closest Mongolian Grill to where I live, but it has not let down. Pretty cheap price, just over $10 for a regular size bowl at lunch, and if you know how to build a bowl like a pro here you can easily get two full size meals in a regular size bowl vice buying the large size bowl. Great selection of sauces and spices to give your bowl some personality of its own. Don't forget about the hot soup and rice they have as well if you want to just make a big bowl of meat and throw it on top of some white or brown rice. The cooks are very attentive and once you bring your tray up they'll quickly help you and get it cooked within a couple minutes. Don't be afraid to ask the staff for help with picking your sauces if you're having trouble! Only a couple times have I had to deal with a line, and at that seating is not hard to get. Great for groups dining on a budget!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! just tried this place out for the first time. I had a gift card for ten bux and decided to use it. This place is the shit! I am soo stuffed as I write this up.  You walk in and the bubbly hostess/mgr offered our assistance b/c we had no clue what to do. Very clean place. She walked me through the line to show us how to add the protein of your choice (freeze dried?) and all the veggies, noodles and she added my sauce concoction. I chose dark meat chix, chix breast, tofu and beef. For veggies onions, mushrooms, brocc, tofu, whole wheat noodles, rice noodles and whatever else I could pile on. Than I told her I like Sweet and hot sauces so she added mine on top. you swing to the cook and he takes your plate which at this point you can add pineapple, peanuts, cilantro. 4 min later walla food is done! you can go to the bar and get soup, crunchy Chinese wonton thingy's (the best) and a drink. Dessert is froyo!!!! all for $8. Go hungry and take home leftovers. I did!"}
{"text":"First time at this YC's. Arrived right at opening and they hadn't finished setting up the food, so a little wait there. The downside to arriving at 11: the curled meats are so rick-hard-frozen that they don't compact in the bowl so I had a rather small serving thru the one-time line.   The cook was pleasant and efficient. I've always liked the wonton chip option, along with other seasonings.   Not a bad meal but could've been better."}
{"text":"I like this YCs way more than the other location because it's always been clean when I go.   Their ingredients are always fully stocked and look fresh as well as their sauce station, rice and wonton area.   It's just a great price for how much quality food you can get and free refills for the variety of drinks they have."}
{"text":"Our first visit was amazing! The gal at the cash register made sure we knew they wanted us to fill our bowls to the brim, unlike most Mongolian eateries. She further helped us with the sauces, making sure we had the flavor we wanted. Additionally, we observed the manager sweeping the floor, assisting customers and interacting with customers and his employees in such a way, that it was clear the employees were a team... They seemed to love their work... Which spills over into a welcome overall environment! Good food, healthy, tasty...upbeat! Great lunch. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I do love this place, and the only reason i give it 4 out of 5 stars is that they keep raising the price! If you pay .50 for a to go box and make a huge meal then it's worth the money since you get 2 meals out of it then. However, most times I go there for lunch during work and I don't have a way to save leftovers so I pay a little more than I would like for just a weekday lunch. I started only going there when I know I can take leftovers with me.  I do love the fact they have so many veggies and tofu! As a vegetarian this is one of my go to places. The tofu is not super firm and rubbery like at Pei Wei. I like being able to create my own meal and it's always super fresh tasting.  The employees there are super nice too. They remember you and have always been hard working."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The best part about it is the people who work here. They seriously didn't stop the whole time we were there. And when I'm sure I looked like a deer in the headlights looking at all the sauce, a girl ran over to help me.   They give you (and this is where my Cali girl voice comes out) hella sauce! If you like a lot of sauce, this is your place. I'm not much of a saucy person. Next time, I'll likely use less.   Otherwise, this is a pretty standard Mongolian BBQ spot. You can pack a whole lot of food into that bowl. Lots of additions you can add also. Price is reasonable. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time with my husband a few days ago. We were there for lunch hours and ordered the large bowls and the young lady explained how it worked. We went down the line filled our bowls and when it came to the sauces the young lady came back to help us out. We took our bowls up everything was ready in a few minutes. The food was yummy and it was kinda spicer than I would have liked but not to the point it wasn't edible. Soda was included along with rice and soup. My husband tried the rice and enjoyed it,no soup for either of us. They do charge for to go boxes. Next time we will pile our food HIGH like the other people who look like their pros."}
{"text":"Just figured out we've been going there for almost 18 years...wow. I perfected my sauce recipe about 17 years ago (though I have had to tone done the chili oil as I've gotten older and wimpier...) This is a fun place to bring out of town folks - won't break the bank, if anyone leaves hungry, it's their fault.  Staff is helpful, food is plentiful, tasty, and you can make it as healthy as you choose to. I think that's the only place besides the McDonalds that's been there for the whole time we've been going to the Pavilions. If you haven't been on a Saturday night to go to the weekly car show, go early, grab dinner at YC's, then check out the cars.  Cheap date for the whole family!  (or go to a movie afterwards) Hoping to go there for at least another 18 years.  :-)"}
{"text":"Went here as a recommendation from a friend. It was amazing. By far the best Mongolian grill i have been to. Everything tastes fresh and is made there. The portions are big as I did the large portion and ate until I could no longer eat and took the rest home and had some more later. Staff was amazing as when they found out t was our first time they helped us through the line and with the sauce selection. Excellent service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"As far as Mongolian BBQ places go, YC's is pretty damn good if you pick the right combination of sauces.  Basically, you can get a bowl for 10.75 or you can pay an extra dollar and get all you can eat. It really depends how you feel. You can try different varieties of sauces and just get small portions throughout or you can pack it into one bowl and hope that you pick the right sauce that you like.  I got the all you can eat because... it's only a dollar more. I ended up getting only two bowls worth, but I honestly don't miss that dollar.   They offer a variety of meats - beef, chicken, pork and fish. I was really disappointed that they didn't have lamb because most places I've been to do. They also have a good amount of vegetables. I usually add bean sprouts, celery, spinach, onions (lots and lots of onions), mushrooms and scallions. Sauces - LOOK AT THE BOARD. I guess some people miss it, but they give you a good number of combinations you can do to make the type of sauce you want. Curry, orange, thai, sweet and sour, mongolian, etc etc. I got the X-pao which basically is a mongolian sauce with a kick. I added some hot chili oil to put in some more, but I like spicy food. I really liked the X-pao, definite recommendation.  On the side, they offer some rice, soup and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. Drinks and dessert (ice cream) come with the meal. Grab it and enjoy! (Only warning is that this place is greasy... as all mongolian bbq places I've been to are, so go in there knowing that!)"}
{"text":"This place is great. There are enough reviews on here that go over the concept and the process of making a good Mongolian bowl. Best advice 1. Pack your bowl with your fist  2. Use at least 5 scoops of sauce  3. Don't forget that there is rice, soup and ice cream still waiting for you after you get your bowl cooked."}
{"text":"First time at this YC's in Tempe. Much better experience than other locations around the valley.   The cashier was pleasant and helpful. She guided me to the food area and described the best way to dish up. Also, her station wasn't crowded right at the door front like other YC's.   The offerings were fresh, filled and inviting. They, like others, have a suggested sauce menu but this trip I just went crazy and tried a little of nearly every sauce. Should have stuck with the menu but it was still tasty.   The soup was strange. Plenty of beef, which is hard to find sometimes but the consume was a bit weak. Nothing a bit of soy couldn't fix. They also offered plenty of herbs and seasonings at the end, which was a nice touch.   I recommend this YC's to anyone who wants an easy, tasty bit of oriental cuisine. BTW, I was thru the line and at my table in 10 mins."}
{"text":"This YCs is located a few doors down from the Gilbert Harkins theater on Germann and Gilbert Rd.  The concept for this restaurant is you put what you want in your bowl, and they will cook it up for you.  They do have several recipes posted on a board by the grill if you want to make curry or teriyaki or what not.  I follow the recipes losely personally, and I think you should have some fun with it too.  I like extra curry sauce in my spicy curry.  Also, it is ok to fill your bowl until it is practically over flowing.  Get your moneys worth!  Also, don't forget the noodles at the end.  The rice is hiding over near the soda machine if you want to add some to your dish after it is cooked.  They also have a soft serve ice cream machine for your kiddies for dessert.  Restaurant is clean and so are the restrooms.  Staff was friendly and the shop was moderately busy, but not crazy busy when we visited on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Way better than the one on Southern in Tempe. We love coming to YCs - fresh food, great flavors and good prices."}
{"text":"First time at YC's today.  I had been to others, years ago, so I was hopeful it would be just as good. It wasn't. The front register is so close to the door that after ONE person walks in, the rest have to line up outside.   On to the food:  Hot and sour soup wasn't hot or sour. Definitely mediocre and needed strong shots of vinegar and hot sauce, which weren't in sight. For the Mongolian BBQ portion, the peanuts were whole, which makes no sense. Not chopped?  Also the sweet and sour sauce was so thin it just missed the mark. The main portions were fine, with good selections of proteins, veggies and sauces.   For ambiance: The TV had still pics of customers and was generally boring. In other words, no ambiance.   I can't recommend YC's at this point but I always give a place two tries, just in case they had an off day."}
{"text":"I\"m so glad we rediscovered this place.  My friend and I had been all grubby painting and were driving around doing an errand on a Sunday early evening when all of a sudden i start feeling bitchy.  Which means my hunger headache was about to hit.  We were in South Scottsdale at the time so we were searching for a place to go as is (pretty grubby) and so we hightailed it to YC's.  I hadn't been here since college which was a lifetime ago.  So glad we came here.  It was really good.  You pick different various meats, veggies, noodles, sauces and they grill it all for you. I totally packed in the bowl.  The price also includes a beverage, side of rice (they have both brown and white), and desert afterwards.  What a deal!    Just fyi....if you can't finish what you got and you have to ask for a to go container they charge like 50 cents for the container."}
{"text":"Total yum! This was a long time find for my Wife and I. When we lived in Oregon we LOVED Chang's Mongolian Grill and really missed a place with the same type of food. YC's has hit the spot finally! Great mix of ingredients and more than enough! I get a full on meal as I like to prepare and season it, Soup, Won Tons with red sauce and a frozen chocolate or vanilla frozen yogurt cone at the end. The only thing I wish they had are the little rice pancakes and plum sauce that Chang's had, otherwise it is a great place to eat and good for all family members young and old."}
{"text":"I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again.   The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.   The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl.   There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.   Free-range and refills on beverages.   Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections.   We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead.   Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I have been going to these places since 1994. It is a good place to get a stir fry that you select the ingredients. Very unique concept. Usually I end up with enough food for 3 meals. The staff will explain how to get the most food for the money.  Prices gave increased over the years but the quality remains the same.  Since they cook with water the calories are kept to a minimum."}
{"text":"Solid Mongolian grill.  Pretty standard.  Get your bowl, pack it with meat, veggies and noodles then make a sauce from one of the recipes on the board or go kamikaze and create your own sauce.  I always try the latter option hoping to discover some amazing combination that hasn't been thought of.  It seems pretty hard to mess it up though.  Depending on what you choose its going to come out one of 2 ways.. spicy or not spicy.  I don't really like being forced to buy a drink with the bowl price, but overall a good lunch."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 5-stars but the consistent price hikes keep me from doing that.  Seems that it keeps getting pricier each year.  I guess that's inflation for you.  As far as the food goes, I really enjoy.   Finally a place where you can load it up to my own liking and not what a dish calls for.  Like the flexibility in picking my veggies, meats, noodles, rice, etc...  Delicious food and I think I got my sauces down!"}
{"text":"Yummo!  Excellent choice of items with a ton of sauces to drizzle right on top.  Bring your hollow leg... it's a TON of food in that bowl.  If you can't finish it, you can buy boxes for your food for I think $.50 or a dollar."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Mongolian BBQ, and I REALLY want to love YC's, but I gotta knock the on their meats. They're incredibly Tough. Not sure where the cuts of meat are coming from, but in the 15+ times I've been there, I've never had tender meat! Super chewy, tough, unnngh.  Grab a handful of toothpicks on the way in!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the selection of proteins and veggies! The part that didn't work so well? The sauces. Many were hard to get to and even harder to dip due to the height of the containers and the sneeze proof glass. I made a total mess (but I cleaned it up too!)Anyway, I didn't follow the \"sauce guidelines\" listed on the wall and just went rogue. This wasnlt a good idea. I ended up with a really bland, soupy mess. TGFS (thank goodness for siracha) or this would have been a big waste. The meat fish and veggies were great, but I made the mistake of adding wheat noodles- BLECH! No taste and kinda gummy-kinda hard.     I would go back and stick with meat and veg and follow directions on the sauce cuz this place is clean and could be both healthy and tasty if done the right way."}
{"text":"The selection of food to put in with your noodles is really great.  We were greeted by Katie, who walked us thru the process.  Food was really really good.  And I loved that I could personalize everything.  Passion iced tea was really tasty too.  While we were eating, we were within earshot of Katie.  She was clearing tables, helping customers with questions, and running around with many jobs.  She was very busy and kept a smile on her face the whole time.  She just had a great attitude and was very knowledgeable about pretty much everything!!  We had a great lunch, but even better service"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying YC Mongolian grill. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of veggies, sauces, and side dishes available. I chose to create my own sauce/version of the Hunan spicy and it was delicious. If you make your bowl well, you will certainly have leftovers. So, just go ahead and purchase your takeout box (.50) upfront. It's worth it for the portion size of a large bowl. Service at this location was great, everyone greeted us, offered to help make sauce, and checked on us after we got a table. I will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for all types of diets including meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans.  Some people that don't eat meat don't like how they cook everything on the same surface but I haven't heard of any other complaints."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here because everyone can get exactly what they want. It's DIY stir fry, so my picky kid can choose 2 ingredients (and he does) and the rest of us can pile on whatever protein, vegetables, noodles, and sauces we like.  There are recipe combinations posted for different sauces, or you can just throw something together and hope for the best.  The price is a little higher than I'd expect for a place that feels so cafeteria-like (we paid $59 for 4 people, plus tips).  But, we always have leftovers to take home that reheat well. Take out boxes will run you $.50 each."}
{"text":"I know I only have myself to blame, because I've ate at Flattop Grill in Chicago which is the same concept - except it was like $15 all you can eat whereas this place was a little more.  (Somehow whatever I make at these places doesn't come out very well!)  Anyway, the concept is cool, but its not worth the premium charge they put on the options there.  I'd rather just go to a buffet that has something like this so its optional and its not your whole meal - and you can eat other things that doesn't come out all sucky.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is fresh (except the meat, which is frozen, which is what knocked the place down a star) and the service is good. For around $9 you can have a bowl full of food, white or brown rice, soup, fried noodles and a drink. The place is clean and you can make your dish however you like."}
{"text":"I love love love YC's.  Where else can I fill a bowl with massive amounts of meat and veggies for like $9?    I went here tonight with my wife and another friend.  It was about 6:30 and it wasn't that busy so that was nice.  It didn't take long for me to fill up my bowl with goodies to the brim and drown it in sauce.  I did mess up a bit with the sauce because it didn't turn out as spicy or as flavorful as I would have liked but it was still great.  In my opinion I don't come here nearly enough.  I probably only say that though because I purposely didn't view their nutritional info so I'm convinced it is relatively healthy.  I mean its not fried fast food stuff, right?  Anyway I love eating here.  The food is great for what it is, the price is right and the service is very good.  Plus I always have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Oh...and the frozen yogurt is garbage."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with the service I received when I visited for the first time yesterday. They were all so kind and accommodating and I plan on going back MANY times."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter who you are, who you're with or what you eat. This place is delish. No matter if you are suffering from heartbreak or new found love nothing can fill that gaping void inside like an overload of veggies, meat and noodles....and meat. Meat."}
{"text":"This place is YUM!  I like that you can customize your bowl and add the things you like best.  The service was very helpful as well.  Lots of great choices and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and super nice staff. Will definentaly go again. Kids lived making their own sauce as well."}
{"text":"If my review was strictly based on my food this would be a five star review. I always get beef with a ton of veggies, Thai peanut chile sauce, and cilantro and peanuts. Delicious, good quality, I've never had an issue.  Now the problems:  the service is hit or miss. Sometimes the girls are awesome and other times not so helpful (different workers, never see the same person twice?).   My daughter's dish is always inconsistent. She gets chicken, lots of broccoli and spinach, and a recipe for YCs special sauce. Two times her chicken stayed frozen (I tasted it, and it was cold). Once she kept complaing hers tasted weird and off, so I tasted and smelled it, and realized the chicken was rotten. I had her throw it out. She was disappointed and hungry.  I really wish I could rate them better, but they have some quality control issues."}
{"text":"I have been going to yc's for years and the experience is always the same.  I would like to compliment the chef (me) about choosing such perfect fresh ingredients into my stir fry bowl.  The sauce was exactly what I wanted since I was the one who made it.    The service is always great and the place is clean.  Perfect for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The people are really nice and you get to put your own meal together. Unfortunately, I am not a good cook, so sometimes my meal is good, sometimes not so much.  If you are a good cook, you will probably love this place.  If you are like me, you might be better off going to a restaurant where a more talented chef prepares your meal."}
{"text":"This place was great.  11.00 bucks all included, drink,soup, and ice cream to finish it off.  You can create your own favor and all.  The place was packed.   We will visit again when we come to town!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Been going there for years.  I love that they have sauce recipes to help you.  They have tons of parking."}
{"text":"I love yc's they have plenty of sauce options and always friendly. One of my favorite Mongolian places."}
{"text":"First time visiting YC's and I enjoyed the selections. You get to mix sauces together to make your own dishes. There is a suggestion board that tells you what you should mix together to get a certain taste.   If you're hungry go for the unlimited. It even comes with soup and ice cream for dessert. Affordable prices and great flavors here.  Perfect food to heat up the next day for leftovers too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to YC's since i discovered this place while i was attending Scottsdale Community College.  Many many lunches were had here in between classes with friends!   It's always clean and the ingredients are always fresh.  Staff is super helpful and you can't beat a place that lets you make your own food!  so if you end up not liking it you have no one to blame but yourself in the end!    A pro tip would be to spend the little extra on the unlimited bowl and make small portions of items to try different things you normally wouldn't instead of making one huge bowl.  Love this place and hope it is around for many more years!"}
{"text":"Clean, spacious, and quick! Great service at this location. Very happy with our visit. Inexpensive and big portion! Try it!"}
{"text":"For $12-$14 you get all the food you could possibly eat.   Drinks, soups, chips, and rice are included. The bowl of vegetables, meats, and noodles are covered in a sauce concoction you can create on your own or one the staff will help you create. I went with the YC's house sauce, which turned out great. They conveniently display the ingredients to create the sauce on a dry erase board above the giant wok cooking area. The staff toss the stuff you crushed into the metal bowl, onto the cooking stone thing, splash your sauce on it, and move it around with a giant stick until it cooks. Maybe I need to get out more, but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this place.  Pretty interesting place to grab some lunch with a few friends. Good deal for the amount of money you pay. They did followup and ask if the sauce turned out well and everything tasted alright. That's always good to have happen.   I would point out, you should probably stick with one sort of meat unless you want to mix cod in with your chicken, pork, or beef. I could see how folks making their first attempt at this could make that mistake. I would bet that would taste pretty bad, not willing to verify that though."}
{"text":"Inexpensive heaps of awesome goodness.  What more can I say?  I love piling my bowl high with tons of meat, veggies and noodles then smothering it in my own concoction of sauce.  I literally can't get enough of this place and wish there were more around the valley."}
{"text":"This is a great place for make your own Asian bowls. You pick the ingredients. They wok it up.  The soup is also amazing.  One side note. They have the best workers in a restaurant I've ever seen. Right up there with 5 star Kai. The hostesses are incredibly hard working. Always cleaning or checking up on the customers. I don't think I've ever seen one standing still. Amazing. It probably is the cleanest restaurant I've ever been in. And it's a fast casual. I even saw a hostess pull a large table off a platform to clean small pieces of rice between the booths. I've never seen anyone do that. Wow  I'll be back. But I'm always there already."}
{"text":"Clean, priced right, fresh and healthy, lots of choices for your bowl, polite staff, and the right to pile your bowl high!  What's not to like???"}
{"text":"This place is totally awesome.  Coming from So Cal, I've been searching for a Mongolian restaurant as I like the option of creating my own stir fry.  Not only am I creating my own stir fry but I can create my stir fry with the healthiest options possible.  Be prepared to fill your bowl with as many veggies and meat as you want.  It's pretty interesting how you are allowed to \"smoosh\" your veggies/meat down so you can fill your bowl for as much as you want.  I was going to rate this establishment a 4 star as it was not pointed out to me that the hostess should actually guide you through the process.  I kinda stumbled my way through especially with the sauce mixture. However, when I ran into the owner at the yoga studio where I practice and told her about my disappointment, she made it right by sending a gift card for a lunch or dinner for two.  Now, that is what I call excellent customer service.  YC's is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my fiance and it was so good. The girl in the front was fantastic.  She helped us the whine way through as this was our first visit.  She even helped me make my sauce.  There's are SO many options of veggies and, as a vegetarian,  this made me very happy. Edamame, asparagus, crikey,  broccoli,  carrots,  water chestnuts,  pineapple,  onions and so many more. A few different types of noodles to choose from and a bunch of sauces to mix together.  After building my dish,  they threw it in the grill and fired it up.  I was left with this amazing good that'll lady me 4 meals!! We are moving up the road in 10 days and YCs will be our new go - to."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Mongolian Grill and it was amazing. When we walked in we were greeted by a nice girl and everyone was very helpful . The food was amazing and I brought a doggie bag home it was so much food, I didn't even fill the bowl. I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Dear YC's,  I have a confession. I cheated on you.. with Genghis Grill near Arrowhead Towne Center. I promise you, it meant nothing to me. Actually, it made me appreciate you even more. As we silently ate our flavorless bowls we thought about you the whole time. We missed your large portions and comforting smells. I also missed your lower prices. Your sauce selection is perfect and I love how your meats are frozen and thinly sliced. I never had a problem filling my bowl with your fresh vegetables and delicious meats, but had to try Genghis because it is closer to my house. I will never make that mistake again.. I will drive to you, happily. Will you forgive me? We will never, ever stray again. In the world of Mongolian BBQ, you are everything to me.   Yours Truly,  Kevin   PS- you should open a location near the 101/17.. there are tens of thousands of us up here that would appreciate it."}
{"text":"We were in the area looking for a place for lunch. The wife found this place on Yelp.  We stopped in and they had what we were looking for. We had never been to this one. The food was good and there was plenty to eat. Great flavor.  Not really knowing how the place worked. Fortunately for us Alexia was the hostess. She was very professional and friendly.  She asked if we had been there before and explained how it all worked.  She then came by while we were selecting our food and made sure we knew how to select our food.  She came back and made our sauce for us and took our food to the cook for us.  She checked on us twice while we were eating. The food was great and Alexia made the experience a good one. Thank you Alexia"}
{"text":"The food was great, but what made me take the time to sit down and write a review was how helpful Jordan was.  Right when I walked in the door she was helping me out. When she found out it was my first time there she walked me thru everything and made sure I knew how everything worked. I go to a lot of places and she was one of the best I have seen!"}
{"text":"We have probably visited yc hundreds of times and this is our first bad experience.  Got lectured because some of my noodles fell onto the tray and put them in the sauce bowl so they wouldn't get wasted.   Probably not a very good idea to lecture a 42 year old man about not wasting a few noodles.  Really gives me a bad taste about coming back any more, at least to this location."}
{"text":"Since this is my son's favorite restaurant, I find myself here a lot.  Lots of meats and veggies to choose from.  I also like that they have bowls to mix up your tasty sauce for your creation."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years, and have always left satisfied (and full).  Starting off with meat, there's chicken, turkey, beef, or pork (and I think there's fish at night). All four of the meats are pretty good - they're all pretty much equally good, so no real favorite.  Next comes the veggies - my plate usually consists of carrots, onions, green onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. There are plenty of other choices that I'm not too fond of, like broccoli, tofu, bean sprouts, and several more that I can't think of.  I always go with the standard noodles, but they've also got rice noodles that look like they might be pretty good.  The sauces are pretty awesome. My usual consists of some YC's own, orange, garlic, ginger, and spicy hunan. Or if I'm in the mood, I'll go with just a straight up sweet and sour. But it's an art to make the right combination and also the right amount, so you may be safer just following the recommendations on the board.  As they prepare the dish, there's a few minutes to put together a bowl of rice, a bowl of pretty decent hot beef soup, and some chips and sweet and sour sauce, along with my drink (all of this is included in the price). By this time, your meal is probably close to ready - top the bowl off with some cilantro, and there's your meal.  I haven't tried the frozen yogurt, but I think it was pretty cheap, like a buck, so if you're in the mood for dessert, it's definitely worth it.  Overall, this place is great - you get plenty of food for your money, and it's fresh and pretty healthy."}
{"text":"The ability to make your stir-fry with no surprise ingredients is a plus. You also get to season your build-your-own stir-fry with various sauces and oils -- but there are also suggestions of what flavors could go great with your selections."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened, decades ago.  I believe this is the longest standing restaurant at the Pavillions (now Talking Stick).  On my visit last weekend, I witnessed a mother and daughter (in front of me in line) abusing the staff, breaking the rules, and being all around nasty people.    They had ordered the small bowl (which is plenty of food for even the largest of appetites), but began smashing literally pounds and pounds of meat with another bowl, and was politely told that using a second bowl to smash food is a no-no.  She reacted extremely rudely and continued doing it.  When the employee noticed her, he politely reminded her that it was against the rules.  At this point, her bowl is stacked 20 hands high, food is falling on the floor and all over the counter, and she continues adding more and more food... she yells at the employee \"you're harassing me, you don't need to tell me again, stop it! Stop it!  Stop it!  You're harassing me!\".  He offered her money back but she got angrier.  If it were me, I would have dumped her tray into the trash and tossed her out.    So, my lunch was spent sitting across from this horrible woman watching her eat herself to death.  My advice to the staff--don't let these people bully you."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food, come during an odd time of days meal times get busy! Stack it high and squish it down. I like the verity of ingredients and the \"sauce\" menu"}
{"text":"This restaurant should not be under the Vegetarian/Vegan listing as it is not. Even if you pick just veggies they don't have a separate frying plate for vegetables and they get this done on the same one used for meat. Ugh..."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. You have to pile your bowl high because it cooks down.  Left overs are good the next day."}
{"text":"For $11 you get a huge bowl of delicious food, drinks and dessert (frozen yogurt). I always have leftover. The meal shrinks after cooking so be sure and really put a lot of food into your bowl when making it. I also like to double my sauce recipe to intensify the flavor. Only bad think here is that you have to pay for a Togo box. If they didn't charge for Togo boxes I would five 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love going to this place. Service is alway great, employees are friendly. Pretty clean floors and tables. Fresh vegetables, never any empty containers. Like the sauce options and suggestions that they have listed. Always have enough left over to take home. Evenings are pretty busy. Recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"By far some of the best customer service around. The employees are super accommodating in making sure you don't have any questions while in line. They help with making sauces and were genuinely caring people.  Not to mention the food was awesome and lasted for about 2 whole meals after- would definitely recommend and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I wish I could figure out my own special sauce recipe but the ones they have figured out work. They're clean and customer service is always good."}
{"text":"First time for Mongolian BBQ and first trip here.   It was good!     We liked it a lot.    Loved the options of meats, veggies and sauces.    Definitely worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was yummy! It was entertaining to watch the men make the food on the round grills! Even the frozen yogurt was good. You have to pay extra for that though."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Normally I dine at the one on indian bend. Maybe it was just me but the \"buffet\" had fewer options.  I got my food to go. I got the large bowl and filled it to the point I could barely carry my tray. I ended up with two large containers, plus a small container for rice, and a drink. The gentleman at the door was very helpful. He asked if I wanted a container for soup, I didn't because the soups were not vegetarian. I would like to see them have one meat based and one without. Other than that they definitely carter to vegetarians, they have a card you can take so the guys will clean the grill prior to preparing your food in case of allergies or you simply don't want your tofo/veggie creation cooked in meat. I would also prefer little cups to pour my sauces in rather than in the bowl to gain a better picture of how much sauce I'm using vs actually need.  For just under ten dollars I have food for 2-3 meals."}
{"text":"Your meal is what ever you make of it, so make it a good one.  Ok so I stole that line from back to the future but it is true. Imagine a salad bar but with raw Asian food ingredient with  cook at the end. One big pro about this style is that you can get just what you want. I for example do not eat meat. YC's allows me to cram as many veggies, noodles and tofu into a bowl as humanly possible. For me it has become a game, how many bowls can I fill post cooking. My current record is three. I can give you bowl construction tips if you would like. If it is not in the bowl it will not be cooked.  The sauces play a big role in the flavor of your meal. If you ask they will let you take a separate bowl for sauce and even help you mix. I like to make my own with generous amounts of garlic and hunan sauce. If you do like garlic like I do be sure to ladle garlic from the bottom of the container as that is where the real pieces are.   After you leave the cooking line you can augment your food with fried won ton strips, spicy oils, mustard's, peanuts, fresh cilantro, sesame seeds, pineapple and more. There also is a station with rice and soups for those who require more than just a bowl of Asian goodness. Soda is included with the meal price and for dinner so is access to the frozen yogurt machine.   If you can not finish your meal they will gladly sell you to go boxes at .50 a piece.    The one thing that confuses me is the name, Mongolians are a nomadic people, yet their BBQ grills are huge I don't see how that would work."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend!! Loved it:) will be back! Next time I will def add extra sauces though. Yum!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here so when we came in Sunday for lunch our expectations were high since we've been craving it for so long.   It wasn't crazy busy which was nice, I hate waiting behind people.   The vegetables were fresh and well stocked. Instead of creating my own sauce I decided to just follow the board, I'm not good at direction but the Spicy Thai was wonderful. My biggest problem was the chicken, it tasted like jerky.   We'll be back but next time sticking to a vegetarian lunch!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review from the toilet.  Today I went to YC's and half way through my bowl I found a piece of RAW CHICKEN.  It is beyond ridiculous that this happens in 2018.  So please please please steer clear of this place UNLESS you want to clean your system out."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The ingredients are very fresh and you can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you like.  The employees are extremely helpful and attentive.  The manager walks around and  asks if everything is to your liking.  So many choices.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible here.  Two lines and they'll only service one. Makes no sense.  Better off going to Panda Express...."}
{"text":"Employees here are awesome, very friendly and helpful ( and cheerful).  Good selection of meats and veggies. Cooks are friendly and fast ! I always top them.  Very refreshing place considering most places are blazay  with their customers."}
{"text":"It's great: walk in, get a bowl, smush as much into a bowl as you can, add sauce, they cook, you eat.  Pick the meats you like. I usually stick with beef. Add veggies. I pick lots of mushrooms. I add tofu to add protein. Pour on sauces to flavor. They have recipes posted to guide you. Then hand your bowl over to the chef and he cooks it and gives you it back all nice and hot in a clean bowl. You can then add a bowl of rice, get a bowl of soup, a glass of something to drink and you're all set.  I used to eat here a lot when I lived in Mesa. We were up here so stopped in and enjoyed lunch. It's a great value for your buck!"}
{"text":"The best mongolian grill on the face of the planet."}
{"text":"3+ meals for $10.75? GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)  How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.  I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!  Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.  Ask the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!"}
{"text":"I don't really like Mongolian Grill concepts... But YC does it right..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food. My friend had a couple bites from my bowl and the woman working there rudely told us \"that's not allowed, don't do that again\" Soda selection wasn't great. Ice cream sucks. Anddddd a large bowl is $15. And $0.50 for a to go box lol"}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure in the valley. Love the concept,  the food tastes amazing, and for the amount of food you get it's fairly priced. Been coming here since 2000!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh meat, vegetables, noodles and sauces to make your own custom stir fry. The servers are attentive and the environment is clean. I try to stay away from the lunch hour of 11:30 to noon as they are usually crowded and you may have to wait in line."}
{"text":"How could you not like this place? You know what you like so you make your dish EXACTLY how you want it. The staff gets an A+ for being friendly and helpful.  I'd recommend piling as much as you can onto your plate when picking through the buffett line.  They give wax paper out at the beginning of the line to help compress the food prior to cooking."}
{"text":"If I could give YC's 3 1/2 stars, that would be what I would rate them. I am torn on them being just ok or me being a fan. On one hand, they are a great value because you get alot for what you pay. The small bowl is a ton of food since you put as much meat, noodles, and veggies in it as you want (a tip, keep adding and smashing it down cause it does shrink when they cook it up). The food taste good most of the time if you order the right sauce. They have so many different kinds of sauces that you can concoct, however, I feel like most taste the same. There are really two flavors: good and not so good. The not so good are the ones that are supposed to have a sweet and sour flavor and the good ones have more of a teriyaki flavor. You can get as much rice, fried wontons, and soup as you want. So your meal plus all this for about 8.00 and you can get a box for an extra 25 cents I believe. With all the food you get, its more than enough to last you for 2 meals. This is a decent place if you like good value and ok food."}
{"text":"I went last night at 8:30pm and the doors were CLOSED!  I just wanted food to go:( why couldn't they attended me!?   That's a waste of business, closing a half an hour before actual closing time? Really guys?? I had to go to subway, I guess it's good business for subway:p    Maybe complaining to the manager might be good, I LOVE THIS PLACE, but why close at 8:30pm when the sign says 9:00pm?   The food is great and all I've been coming here for the past 2years, but my one star goes to closing WAAAYYYYYY to early.  What a disappointment!  What's the point of going after work for dinner if it closes WAY before closing time?:(  Thanks for not wanting to attend me, I'll be choosing other places to eat.  It would of been 5 stars:("}
{"text":"I really really wished they had a place like this in cali.  southern cali specifically since I live in LA, cause we have nothing like this here and I am more the jealous.  This is basically a genghis khan self-service version + you get soup!!!  So the fun and excitement of this place is that you are able to pack your food into your bowl... as much as you want... whatever you want... however you want... including the meat!!  It was soo funn-- I've never gotten to do that and I seriously had the best 5 mins of my life. :)  Sauces are delicious and I got creative with the sauces mixing a couple of flavors and added green onions and peanuts"}
{"text":"It's a little expensive to eat here I think but the food is just so tasty. If you have any type of food allergies - this isn't the place for you... too many opportunities for cross contamination so stay away. I hadn't been here for a while but during my recent visit they have some staff there to help you mix your special blend of sauce for your food - great idea YC's. So many people get hung up here so this is a nice addition.  I also like this place because it's pretty quick to get through the line and start eating."}
{"text":"Newest location, same formula, ever growing prices.  I have allays liked YC's, Where else can a get a tofu, veggie, noodle stir fry spiced as highly as I want, with a portion large enough to feed me for two meals.  This new location is clean and efficient like their south Tempe location. The price of a large bowl is up to $9.10  and dogie bags are still $.50 a pop.  Some items have vanished from the food line, like baby corn,  and water chess nuts, both of which are missed.  If you are going for the first time, be sure to pile your food high and pack it in the bowl and to use alot of sauce, the will let you take a 2nd bowl just for sauce if you ask, and I recommend doing that."}
{"text":"Horrible staff, out dated restaurant good food. I've been visiting for 20 years and it's gotten nothing but worse every year. Prices are going up along side employee attitude.   In fact last time I was here I swore that I would never go back. Not because of the poor attitude of the young girl who was the only staff member but because when I complained to the owners email I received a highly apathetic and unapologetic response. Upon my reply (attempting to elaborate on my distain, that he failed to understand) to his short winded response I was ignored.   Very sad"}
{"text":"Holy smoke! This place sucks! It's like the Old Country Buffet of Mongolian Grill joints. Food was totally mediocre. And that's giving them a compliment. The two \"cooks\" took our food, threw it on the hot iron then took our sauce / seasoning. Put that on top then dumped a gallon of water on it, pushed it around for a minute and gave it to us. It was horrible! Flavorless and totally undercooked. The rice they offered looked like it was a week old and cold. My potatoes were still raw. I had to go back to the sauce and spice collection to get any flavor on my meal at all. Won't be back. Waste of money. Was there for the Saturday night car show. I now know the reason why McDonald's was so busy. Next time I'll wait in line there, its way more worth the time and money."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here to night with friends. I thought it was good, my wife did not. This is a place where you get a bowl to add all the raw items you want to have cooked on a very large flat stone surface. Then you add sauces for from a large variety to a separate bowl to add to your raw items when cooked. They have suggestions but you don't have to follow this. I created my own and I was sure to dip my finger in my sauce bowl to check the state. Be sure to do this as the sauce needs to be pretty strong because a lot of it will be lost when it is cooked on the flat stone. My wife failed to do this and hers turned out to be not very flavorful. Overall it was good for me and I would come back. It would be especially good for gluten free eating or low carb as everything is clearly marked GF or not and most of the items are low carb."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite. The staff is so friendly and accommodating! Everyone in my family can get something they like, even my picky 6 year old nephew! We love this place and come as often as we can!"}
{"text":"I accomplish 3 things when I go to Yc's Mongolian grill. 1. I feed myself for the rest of the year. 2. Save money  3. Get a great tricep workout.  Ycs Mongolian grill is a great go to place if you're looking for a casual dinner/lunch. Every date I bring here turns out to be amazing. You get amazing customer service. All the employees are well trained and polite to the customers. The prices are very reasonable for the unbelievable amount of food you get. This is a great place to explore your imagination with all the combinations of food and sauces you can create. I feel like Da Vinci while creating my meal and you can too."}
{"text":"One word:  Gluttonous  The fact that you can pile as much food into and far beyond the top of the bowl given to you is reason to start moving toward a 5 star rating.    In the land of opportunity where a person can stroll in and reward themselves for anything they like, usually just making it through the day without cutting your wrist, it's an American's dream.   It's sort of like a one time all you can eat buffet.  It's worth the price of admission just to see others work their magic while they pile on the food 6 inches or more above the rim of the bowl.  I believe there is an art to this master craft of self indulgence.  I was awestruck by this man who redefined the term, \"the sky's the limit.\"    I will be going back this coming week to try and either 1)  break my own record set last week  2)  To match the height of the guy I saw on this last visit  or 3)  To eclipse his mile high feat and take this to a new level.  The next best thing about this place is that for 50 cents, you can purchase a box to put whatever you don't eat in and take it with you.  If this doesn't stir up the pig pen, I don't know what will.    Oink Oink"}
{"text":"I love this place! For an  extra buck you can get unlimited trips to the buffet, but lets face it, you are usually stuffed after just one trip. Great choice for people watching their carbs too, just lay off the noodles."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food you pick out the size bowl you want to purchase you fill it with what food you want in it and they will add sauce and wok it. The meal includes chips rice soup and drink very good for the money amazing food the person that takes your money upfront is very knowledgeable ask them if you have any questions you'll have a great experience I loved it it was my first time"}
{"text":"Does YC's stand for \"yucky chinese?\"   That's what I'm wondering as I am slowly trying to put down this food. This is such a fun and exciting concept, and the service was beyond amazing, but wow... this \"food!\" My sauce to meat/noodles/vegetables ratio is about 100:2. Being that you're supposed to choose your own food/sauce, including the amount, it should be my fault; however, the nice young lady who works there made my sauce. There's a menu board of how to make your sauces, but since there are two meal sizes you can choose from, I think they need to re-doctor those recipes to fit each of the sizes. I feel like I'm eating spicy soy and sesame sauce soup.    I think the price is pretty reasonable for everything you get: meal, drink, soup, great service.YC, re-doctor your sauce recipe and I may consider my return."}
{"text":"Best ever. Stack it high and create you're own creations.   My favorite.. On top of food add 1 ycs own 1 sweet n sour 1 paneang 1 cooking wine 1 curry. In sauce bowl 3 ycs own 3 sweet 2 ginger 2 garlic 1 cooking wine sesame oil over the top and hot chili oil.  You're welcome"}
{"text":"Love this place everything is pretty good specially the wheat noodles and sweet n sour or teriyaki sauce. You will always end up with left over and at the end you get a nice yogurt ice cream n everything for under $15 per person."}
{"text":"Squish squish so you can Eat a Dish. How Crazy is that? They even provide wax paper just for squishing down your food to CRUSH as much as you can into the tiny dish.  I was a first timer and didn't know the squish thing or even had an idea what the wax paper was for until I saw OTHER PEOPLE displaying humiliating , embarrassing ,  disgraceful behavior crushing down food and then piling maybe as high as 10 inches above the bowl. Some people actually had to jump in the air to squish. ( I am sorry now I didn't video and send this up to You Tube.)  The meats and vegetables seemed fresh and I didn't notice any vegetables being canned (like at the Gag Us Chain) But I really didn't like the watered down sauces. Unlike the other stir fry places here you need to add maybe 7 ladle's of sauces to get the correct flavor and then you get a BOILED vegetable dish. YUCK!  I know MOST people enjoy coming here and doing the squish thing eating a boiled dish of food for approx. $10 but I can go to my favorite Chinese and get a rice bowl that taste better and is bigger and not crushed food for only $3.50 or spring for the whole lunch plate for only $4.95 so you won't be seeing me here again.  As for Stir Fry Places I like the independent Stir Fry place on Bell Rd is better than this place or the Gag Us Chain because I don't have to squish down food , I (don't) but I can go back and get as many Stir Fry's as I like at that place and the sauces aren't watered down so the food comes out better.   To each his own . Different Stir Fry's for different folks Eat what YOU like!"}
{"text":"Was craving noodles and stopped in here not knowing what to expect. Didn't realize it was a make-your-own-meal kinda place, but I still went with it. I have to admit, along with some of the other reviewers here, I was a little grossed out by the frozen meat and \"packing\" everything down in the bowl. However I did like the fact that I could choose whatever veggies I wanted.   I went a bit crazy on the sauce (I REALLY like saucey food apparently) and went with 2 different ones (and like 4 ladles full between the 2) even though I didn't have any clue what they were. I was VERY pleasantly surprised with my concoction. It was delicious if I do say so myself. I got the food to-go and also got a bowl for my husband and used different meat and sauces for his, and he really liked his too. I'm not sure you can really screw up on this, unless you don't put enough sauce I guess in which case it could be bland? Go heavy on the sauce I say.... p.s. the meal comes with soup and I got the house special and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Make your own Stir-Fry and they give you the ability to fit as much in the bowl as possible! Great service and fast!"}
{"text":"I love YC's! Its really good for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Seriously, where can you get this amount of food for the price? I suggest getting the small bowl because the big one is enough for 3 people to eat if you pack it in right!   I was bummed though that their ice cream machine wasn't working. Their register too was messed up so they told me to check my bank account. I was only charged once but they should get it fixed!"}
{"text":"Yum! Quick! Yum! More food than you would even think! Lots of great seating"}
{"text":"Very good food and very fresh. The staff is friendly and helpful. Overall we really enjoyed our meal and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place. You can load up in veggies and noodles. The portions are huge and the menu of sauce possibilities is great for trying out new things. Love that a drink is included in the price of a bowl. Great side options like rice and soup! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I haven't had Mongolian BBQ in quite some time so we decided to go today. We walked up to a nice shaded patio and right when you open the door is the counter to order.  Service was friendly, helpful and patient. I brought in my elderly grandmother who did not understand the concept and everyone was so nice to us the entire time down the line.  Didn't try the self serving rice, soup, or frozen yogurt because I was full but it's offered which is nice.  I'd come back again, They have more than one location in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place holds such a special piece of my heart. I've been eating at YC's since I was a little kid. Back when they only had the one location on McClintock...old school. Ive eaten here so many times, Im pretty sure that I am personally responsible for their being able to open two other shops around the valley.  When I was in high school, my youth group made this place their chapter eatery and I literally ate here every single Wednesday night. It also became a tradition to stop in here after a long weekend convention. Now that Im all grown up and advising for that youth group, it comes as no surprise to me that the tradition has continued with the chapter who still comes after each large regional event.  I love the food here, and its a bit of an experience. The first time you go, you should try to go with someone whose been before and has some experience. The price isn't cheap, but it justifiable if you know what you're doing. Ill give you a few hints: 1) Pile it high...REALLY high!. Not kidding. WAY above the edge of the bowl. If its a challenge for your noodles on top to balance, then you've done it right. This should wind up being 2 or more meals for you. 2) Get a separate bowl for your sauces. A lot of sauce is your friend because so much of it is going to be cooked off. 3) Try to avoid veggies that cook down too much like cabbage and spinach. Too much of it is gonna turn your mountain-o-food into a bite-size portion. 4) If you like as much broccoli as I do (thats a lot people), ask them to cook yours \"well-done\". Otherwise the stems on the broc dont cook all the way through. 5) Syrup. One of the \"sauces\" is syrup. Dont underestimate this because it will make your sauce nice and thick and awesome. The rest of the experience you will have to figure out for yourself ;-)  So why not 5 stars? Well its simple. I dont get to come all that often any more now that I live in Tucson. Every time Ive been more recently, it seems theyve figured out a new way to make a bigger profit at the expense of their customers. First, a long time ago, they started charging for ice cream. Then they started charging for to-go containers. Then they got rid of the \"return visits allowed\". Most recently, they got new smaller bowls. They've also raised the base price probably 4 or 5 times since I was younger.  One other thing I will warn you of, and I apologize for the graphic nature of this, but this place gives me (and all my friends) some serious shits. Theres nothing wrong with the food or how they cook it, but for some reason it just happens. The fact that its still worth it for me, in my honest opinion, should speak volumes about how much I must like this place.  Great option for vegetarians (beware fish sauce in the YC's own) and meat-eaters alike. I will continue to come back as long as Im around and/or they are."}
{"text":"YC's Mongolian Grill is my absolute favorite places in the world for stir fry! Hands down the best! I Love that they have fresh ingredients, and a wide verity. The beat part? YOU get to make your own! Its also pretty cool to be able to watch them make your food RIGHT in front of you!! It's a pretty cool experience!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this restaurant the food has been extremely fresh and tasty. The place is clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place and crave it whenever I'm home in AZ. Last night I met my family there and my nieces and nephews thought that watching their food cook was the greatest thing. My nephew finished before all of us and one of the associates even helped him get the crunchy chips things and a drink while we finished cooking our food!  I wish I'd caught their name because it really made him feel special.   I like to create my own sauce instead of following the recipes...lots of garlic and spicy hunan. I also overload the sesame seeds on top for a little crunch...great, now I'm hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Should be 3 1/2 stars . I do like it's a healthier way to eat when going out to eat. Don't like you have to pay for a to go box and wish it was nicer inside .it's a very cafeteria look and feel.."}
{"text":"Always get a box to go immediately because I get so much food. Quality seems decent but hey as a college you can't go wrong. You pick all the ingredients and they have a board with all the recipes that they offer. I like to full a separate bowl for sauces that way I can really stuff my bowl because once again IM cheap and most of us go here to pile up as much as possible. Also check out the jalapenos and pineapples by the cook line, if you haven't tried it its worth a stop."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for places where I can grab a healthy meal to go. Have been very impressed with YC's since I started going to it a couple of weeks back.   First off, love the concept. You get a bowl and you can pile it high with various meats, veggies, noodles, and rice. You pick a sauce and then hand everything over to one of the chefs who cooks it right there in front of you. You also get a soup, won tons, and a drink, all for $11-12. It's a good deal. I usually grab some brown rice, white meat chicken, a ton of veggies, and top it with some curry sauce for a very healthy, satisfying meal.  The cashiers and chefs are always extremely friendly. The first time I was in, two servers walked me through the whole process. Just very nice people and it's always consistent every time I go.  Overall, kudos to the owners as they really know how to run a business. I've also been to the Elliot Road location and it's the exact same experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and am very happy I did. ~$12 for a huge meal which included a drink, rice, soup, and sauces (and free refills). It's a build your own meal kind of place. If you pack the bowl the best you can and have it almost overflowing when you bring it to be cooked, you'll have enough food for your trip and 2 more meals later. Very fresh food with a great variety and friendly service."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever eaten. The portions are huge, so don't eat anytime before you go.  You pick your food out and they cook it right in front of you, plus there is always soup and rice and pineapple to have on the side. You get a drink included. It's packed on weekend nights, especially since there's a classic car show right out front."}
{"text":"YC's is a great place to hit up if you have a hunger gap that is bigger then a normal restaurant can fill. It is a build-it yourself mongolian grill and the possibilities are endless for what you can create. No matter what you get, if you are smart, you can manage to stuff enough food in your $12 bowl to feed a small village. The trick is to use the bottom of another bowl to smash your ingredients down.   They have been cracking down on that sneekiness as of late, but if you can get away with it, it is well worth it. Another important point is that they charge you 50 cents for a to-go box, but you will need one so just plan on adding that to the budget. Also, when you are building your meal, the red meats will be more flavorful and you will most certainly need to add more flavorings than the amounts listed on their ingredient list. Have fun because this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Soo good! First timer today and at first I thought it was a little pricey - $15 for bowl and tip - but then you see how much food you can get and it could feed a family of 4 no joke! Everything was delicious, loved the spicy sauces, and wait staff helps everyone thru the line to make sure they understand everything. Super cool place!"}
{"text":"The concept was good but you need to learn how to get the things right...our sauces in spite of getting help form the guy turned to be very salty.Now if you ask for help for adding sauce and still get a salty food???I am not sure whom to blame. If you r an expert at adding sauces....best of luck.They had rice and chips but we were not sure how should we eat the rice with mustard?????I know people were very happy that they can stuff food for 12 bucks but you go to you local Chinese place and you do get 3 days of food for that money though.Anyways we did not have luck in getting the right food so we are not going back."}
{"text":"I've been to list location many, many times over the years. We typically go on a weekend when it is less crowded. I avoid weekday lunch time crowds.   Food is typically good, but prices keep going up. For two of us on a Saturday evening is was $33 including the built in tip (suggested tip, that is) on the new fancy register system that many establishments seems to use now.  I doubt that our visit will be as frequent because it is pricey.  Consequently we smooshed whatever we could to make the most of it and got a to go box. (I think they still charge a $1 for one.) This way we could get more meals out of it and in my money conscience mind, if we can get more meals out of it, it brings the cost of a meal down.    There is one other thing that gets me because I'm a germ-a-phobe. People serve their veggies with large spoon. The spoon handles are frequently placed on top of the food itself. Does this mean their hand germs are on my food?  I try to appease myself by saying that whatever germs there are on the veggies is cooked off from the high temperatures. I\"m not sure this is right but at least I can eat my meal. I don't know how this should be handled health wise or what the health department codes is, but I am cautious.   Service good, the establishment is clean and staff friendly. We will probably go here once or twice a year based on cost."}
{"text":"Very quick service with a a large variety of sauces, spices and mixes. Fresh meat and veggies. Literally all you can eat and drink. Unlimited drinks, soup and rice. Will return for sure"}
{"text":"I've done Mongolian several times.  I like it.  I'd heard about this place, and the reviews here seem to be good, so let's give it a try!  We were greeted very enthusiastically by a young man I assume (based on observations through the evening) was the manager.  They have two sizes of bowls.  The large is only $1 more.  And they have an option for unlimited refills for another dollar above that.  All prices include drinks and frozen yogurt (and rice and soup).  The actual ingredient table was nothing special.  Limited spices, smaller selection of veggies.  A few sauces, though they include recipes for mixing several more.  One of their people was very helpful at the sauce table, mixing what we wanted.  Though they didn't have (or I didn't see) some standard sauces like szechuan.  And the names of the spices really didn't tell me much about them (except \"cumin\", of course...and \"lemon pepper\").  So it was sort of a guessing game what I was getting.  They encourage you to pack your bowl, and even have tissues to aid in doing so (and keep your hands clean).    The staff is friendly. The sauce was not very strong, even though I chose \"spicy Hunan\".  The flavor was really pretty mild.  And the noodles were either rice or wheat.  Really?  What about soba?  To compare and contrast, Genghis Grill has a larger selection of spices, sauces (though no recipes to mix variations), and seemed more flavorful.  But the quantity at YC's is definitely a LOT more.  Even packing the same amount, their large bowl is much larger.  I will probably try them again to see if a different selection of spices and sauces will improve the flavor.  Next time I'll do rice noodles, too.  I may update my rating when I try again."}
{"text":"I love YC's and have been to this location several times. The fixings are always fresh and well stocked, I love the fact that you can choose from different type of noodles. I only wish that there was a way to make your sauce a little saucier. The wok looks scalding hot and they have to add water to your food to prevent from burning, this makes stir-fry flavorful but a bit dry (not enough sauce for my taste). Everybody that works there is super helpful and friendly, too."}
{"text":"YC holds a very special place in my heart.not because all the food you eat while your there lol but for the different flavors you can create with all the fresh ingredients. And not to forget the yummy noodles remember the more food you pack in that little bowl the more you get to take home : )"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! This location is also really good the manager is always working very hard to keep it clean and well stocked. I highly recommend! If you've never been, you are missing out!  Also I noticed they do take allergy into consideration, someone had an allergy and they cleaned everything very quickly and serviced them without much disruption. It's nice to know they are so inclusive and do it well!"}
{"text":"13 dollars for a bowl a food seems a little pricy but you get a lot of food. The kicker is that to take your leftovers home they charge you for the the box. This seems ridiculous to me. I dont want to waste my leftovers but I dont want to pay for a to go box sry."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been going for years, but last Sunday they asked me before I paid the bill if I wanted to include a tip for the cook who prepares my food.... seriously?"}
{"text":"I was actually very impressed with this place.  Service is about as good as I have had anywhere in the city.  The girl who took our order when we came in was very helpful.  Then someone else came over to help us with the sauce.   The guy who cooked was also very helpful and friendly.  Then there was another little girl who came to our table.    And most of all it actually tasted damn good.  for some reason I thought the white rice was especially good.  I try to make it like that at home but I'm not Chinese so I screw it up I guess.  I did not like either of the soup options.  I had a green tropical tea which was outstanding.  Generally I like coke this place has Pepsi but they have 5 tea options so that more than makes up for it.  I got the small bowl and I stuffed it mashed down to get as much as possible.  Which ended up being too much.  I had beef which was really taste I think because they slice it thin.  I added broccoli and mushrooms. I know it sounds simple with all the options but it was a great combo.  with sweet and spicy.  The girl even showed me some spicy oil to make it more spicy.  At first I was hoping for shrimp which they don't have. The fish option is Alaskan cod. I highly recommend the beef.  I try to stay away from beef but this was worth it.  The other thing I noticed was the staff really cleans the tables and booths. Which I appreciate.  How many times do you go to restaurant and sit in a booth that has crumbs."}
{"text":"I've been coming to YC's since the late 90's for lunch. Back then, it was always part of my workout trips. Hit the rock-gym, stop at YC's on the way back for a large bowl + to-go box.   Now, I won't talk about the food, flavors or quantity you get with your meal. That's been covered by pretty much everyone. And suffice to say, if I wasn't a fan I wouldn't have kept coming back. And over the years, the place definitely has improved itself. It has added more variety of vegetables sauces to be added to your meal, and adding the two-lane system now in place definitely improved the speed at which people are able to load up their bowls. In short, I love this place.   So why have I only given it 3 stars? Well because I remember how I could come in and get a great meal (and often a meal for later) for $8 including my to-go box. I get it that the cost of items goes up. I get it that operating costs go up. I was ok when the price went to $10. I was somewhat satisfied when the price went to $12 (though the frequency of my visit definitely decreased). Now the price is $14. The frequency of my visits will cease completely. I love YC's, but I just can't justify the price anymore."}
{"text":"My biggest tip for newbies to YC's, look toward the grill and look up.  There you will find a nice little menu of sauce formulas.  Unfortunately, I never looked up.  As a result, I didn't have enough sauce.  In my case, that was a good thing because the sauce I did have tasted like crap, so more of the same would have been even crappier.  As for the ingredients, lots of choices with fresh veggies.  I have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me.  In fact, I had to ask my husband what the hell it was.  I guess it's a good thing you don't see piles of freshly sliced meat, else it might not be so fresh after all.  But in its frozen to minus 500 degrees F state, I found I opted for more veggies.  Two sizes available.  I went with the large, crammed my bowl full until it resembled a small mountain, and then wasted over half of it.  So get the small unless you want leftovers or you haven't eaten in several days."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool concept.  We went for the large option where you get to pack a large bowl but no refills but unlimited soup drinks and dessert.  The variety was definitely there with stir fry ingredients and compared to how much you get for your money at something similar like panda express it's good value but I think i did a bad job on the sauce mix.  It wasn't wow and maybe that was my fault"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after he picked me up from work, which was around the corner from here.  Price wasn't bad, $10.49 for the large bowl. Same concept as Genghis Grill, fill up your bowl as much as you can, select from chicken, beef, or pork. 6 or 7 pieces of shrimp is $1 extra. Then there's a variety of veggies to add into the bowl, then pick your starch, they had rice noodles, udon noodles and wheat noodles. After that you make your own sauce or the waitress/hostess can help you make your sauce.   There's also a all you can eat chicken or spicy beef soup and also white or brown rice at a little station.   Also included with the $10.49 is unlimited drinks.   The price sure wasn't bad, but I'd prefer Genghis Grill any day. They just have better options."}
{"text":"I love YC! I wish they had a location in San Diego. Well, they do (Great Khan's) but each location varies and the service isn't always consistent.   I came here to eat around noon and it was packed already. Surprisingly, the line went by really quick. There's always a strategy of how to make your perfect YC bowl to get the bang outta' your buck. The last time I went, I choose the large bowl but I think it's better to choose the small bowl because I never finish it at the restaurant. I always end up taking another portion home with me for leftovers.   Step#1: Choose whatever type of meat you want and tenderize it with your fists.They also provide small baking sheet papers to smush them if you don't want to get your fists dirty.  Step#2: Build your broccoli barrier around your bowl.  Step#3: Layer on your favorite veggies onto of your meat and secure your broccoli barrier if you have to.  Step#4: Layer on your noodles. Personally, I like the udon noodles better than the other noodles that they have.  Step#5: Create your special kind of sauce. They have a variety of sauces that you can create or you can remake a sauce that YC has already created. The recipes are located on the wall above the cooking stations.  Step#6: Bring your bowl to the cooking station and the chefs there will cook it for you! The chefs are super friendly and nice! :) At this point, I like to add fresh pineapples and cilantro after they have finished cooking my meal. It's super delicious, definitely a must try if you love pineapples and fresh cilantro.   Step#7: Don't forget your drink, rice, Sriracha, and soup! They have 2 different kinds of soups but their veggie soup is delicious and also my favorite. Perfect to go along with your meal.  I feel like for this particular location, they have less ingredients compared to the other locations. They just have your basic assortment of veggies. Customer service is great, their employees come by to check up on you and clear the tables. If you don't finish your meal, you can get to go containers but they'll charge you for it. I believe it's just 50 cents.  Overall, I think it's worth it! I would definitely recommend this place to every foodie! :)"}
{"text":"This is a fine place for the price. Nothing extraordinary about this food except that it's rather healthy. My kids love making their own sauce recipe. And... that's about it."}
{"text":"Ok...so actually wasn't excited to go to a Mongolian  place tonight...but family thought good so away we went...  Well, first definitely not a newbie mongo builder so was kinda like \"hey you don't need to walk me through this\" but the help was actually helpful and pointing out to grab the tissues to squish down the food and tips on the sauce (put in a separate bowl etc).  So overall great experience.   Nice they have couple soups , chips and sweet and sour sauce at a separate bar plus ice cream-nice!  Restaurant was pretty busy so little messy but...regardleds delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one at Pavilions in North Scottsdale so I think I'm a little pampered in that respect.  However, I wasn't disappointed in the least by the food.  What I always do is fill my bowl with meats of all styles!  Turkey, beef, fish, and smash it down with the papers provided.  PUSH heavily!  After that, I top it off with veggies, and it always gets very ugly but fun.  I smash smash smash and compress.  You can't get it wrong, you really can't.  Follow your heart, and put what YOU want in that bowl.  The sauces are the awesome part too!  This location lets you use a separate bowl for the sauces, which the one in north scottsdale didn't.  I threw what I wanted into the bowl, swirled it up, tasted it a bit to make sure, then went to the end and handed it to the guys to cook it up.  They did a good job, and the only real difference between the different stores is the presentation style.  The one in north Scottsdale is more presentation based and the seating is less fast-food style.  This store is quite fast-food style looking in my opinion, but that doesn't matter to me.  I ate my food, put it into a to-go container for lunch the next day afterwards, and I was golden.  Would I go again?  You're damned right."}
{"text":"It has been several months but I hadn't lost the formula (80/10/10 - veggies, meat, noodles).  Pat down some chicken-turkey (no taste difference as far as I can tell) with the wax paper.  Load up with mostly veggies (more green than red or white), add some wheat noodles to fill the bowl to the brim.  Follow with the sweet and sour mix but add some extra vinegar and orange sauce.  Add some pineapple and all set to have it grilled.  Fill a small bowl with peanuts and another small bowl with pineapple.  Fill the large red plastic drinking vessel with ice and low cal lemonade.  Then chow down...  My formula has more or less stayed the same since being introduced to YC's by Mike T and/or Erik T.  Both took different approaches and none tasted like the other despite selecting choices from the same line.  Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark."}
{"text":"Tuesday night and you don't feel like cooking? Head over to YC's.. fresh and tasty on the cheap! It's so much fun to because YOU control almost every aspect of your bowl.. mine is usually so full its toppling onto the tray.. there are just enough choices to keep me interested in coming back next time thinking, I wonder how that'll taste?!"}
{"text":"I love Mongolian Grills....   There is just something great about being able to create your own meal with whatever you can cram into a bowl so some guy can cook it up for you....   Really if you don't have a good experience at these places it can only be attributed to your own choices...   Great spot when you are super hungry!"}
{"text":"Soooo, I have been to YC's many times. This is the 1st visit at this location.  It was clean, inviting and well staffed. We showed up at 12 noon, right before the lunch rush. I invited a good friend who has not ever tried hete before. I walked her thru the meats and veggies and a staff member walked her thru sauces. It was soo much fun!! After foid was prepared and grilled, we sat down. She said food was amazing. And all the rice and soup and drinks are included!!! We had such a good visit and stayed and talked for over 2 hours. I so wish they had the Kholrabi noodles like Tempe !!"}
{"text":"I have been ceaving YC's for over a week. My yc's buddy (hubby) has not been available, out of tiwn. Now, he says whats for dinnetdinner.. and same time we both saud yc!!!!  I tried a new sauce tonight, Chef's favorite.  I usually make my own, a spicy peanut curry. I did not really like the sauce.. it was good, just too sweet for me.  If it aint broke ( my own sauce way) then dont fix it.. lololol Still my favorite Asian style restaurant!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had mongolian grills in the past. This place by far is the best.  From the time we entered the restaurant,  the young lady at the register walked us through the routine. She even gave us helpful tricks.  I love the sauce creations and recipes on the big boards. The waitress was friendly and came by to take plates/bowls off our table. The price included everything! ! Great concept for a \"buffet\" style restaurant.  We will definitely be back.  The only limitation is your stomach!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was slightly below average of what I would expect of a Mongolian BBQ."}
{"text":"Squish food, thats what we call it, you walk in, pay for a small, medium or large bowl and a drink, go through the salad bar type line, picking out your meats and veggies, this is where the squish comes in, compressing the food in the bowl so you can fit more in, then take it to the grill and they cook it right in front of you, just make sure they don't drown it in water.  You will be full when you leave thats for sure!"}
{"text":"Is this place a chain? Yes. And a good one with decent prices. Being a fitness finato, this is right across the street from Mountainside so any easy go to for lunch or dinner after a workout.   The place is very clean and offers a variety of meats, veggies, and grain/ noodles to cook on the grill. Its ready in minutes! To boot, there's complimentary soups in the event you're prone to becoming hangry. What is very special about this place to me, is they also cater to those who avoid carbs by making a \"noodle\" from kholrabi. I'm not particularly fond of spaghetti squash and these people nailed it with a veggie substitute.  Healthy, tasty... you choose your own spices and sauces. I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"Wow the most ridiculous thing I've ever experienced in my whole life I went to buy my child who is 10 years old a kids meal and was refused because he was not with me !   They made me feel like a fool and basically a liar  I waited in a line that was out the door for a good four minutes and by the time I get to the counter the lady says that I have to have my child with me  I've never had that experience I just felt that it was pretty outrageous   Maria the manager was not helpful at all she said since my son was not with me she will still do it but will have to charge me a 12 year old age plate ?? But he's 10 yrs old ? I don't get it   I am a patient person & very reasonable but when you treat someone like a fool and a liar you don't get my business I'll spend my money at else where   So confusing and annoying that I will not go back to that location ever"}
{"text":"This place is great! Create your own masterpiece. Stack your bowl high with lots of meat and veggies, then read the chalkboard for your favorite sauce combo. Plenty to eat and very delicious  The workers are very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, though I've had better.   The only thing I have to really complain about is that the chef that cooked our food was very very sloppy. Half my broccoli and zucchini, and some tofu flew off while being cooked. I understand if one or two fall off... But both my boyfriend and I lost plenty. Although he cooked it well, I think he could of been a little more considerate."}
{"text":"This place is always delicious!! :) such a great price and guarantee it will feed you at least 2 meals!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! I like the concept of paying for your meal before you start piling on your selections. Make it convenient to leave right after you finish you meal.  The prices was pretty good, you have the option of selecting either a small or large which comes with a fountain drink.   The meats and other selections seemed very fresh and appetizing. I loved how the staff are willing to throw together a concoction of sauces and spices to add flavor to your dish!    All in all this was a fun experience and the food was very delicous! I would recommened this place."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy meats and veggies cooked while you watch with a variety of sauce options. Meal also includes fried wontons, soup, & rice. Avoid the noon time slot as the restaurant is located across from a high school. If it's your first time watch the others before you, there's a skill involved in making your bowl. Also make sure you use the papers by meats to push down meat & get more in bowl, remember the veggies will cook down quite a bit."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable prices, and solid service.  The cost of the buffet/ unlimited around is $12.50 and includes drinks.  The food was all pretty fresh and the wait was minimal.  I will definitely return for some more Mongolian BBQ!"}
{"text":"Service is good, prices have been sneaking up in theist year. The more I pay for these bowls of noddles, the worse they taste.  Time for a game changer if you're going to continue raising your prices.  Next time I'll make the drive to Genghis Grill in the Tempe Marketplace. You pay a little more but the sauce is better, ingredients are better and eggs are free with your purchase. Those little things make the extra few bucks worth it."}
{"text":"I love YCs. My wife doesn't like going with me cause she is  embarrassed by how high I stack my bowl. I stack it to the point that when they are done cooking it they need to use 2 bowls! Don't be ashamed people! Stack as high as you possibly can. You will have left overs for a week. The ingredients are always fresh and I always get the Mongolian combo of sauces. They are great. Also, make yourself a bowl of brown rice and put a scoop of the chicken soup in it. Its awesome and free!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Large portion.  The small size is Huuuuuuge! The interior of the store needs some love. Feels a little lonely and forgotten. I like Ghengis Grill more as far as taste and ambiance go.  Ghengis Grill offers way better seasonings and marinated meats. The portion sizes here are way bigger however. The soup is a nice option."}
{"text":"Well considering I am not a big fan of Stir fry after a very bad experience I had at a place like this a few years ago....I was skeptical about this place. My wife wanted to really try it...so we decided to visit this locale before going to the movies. I have to say for the 21.00 bucks I spent for the 2 of us I was not disappointed at all. The food was very good....the service was first class....and the meal comes with a drink and dessert as well. However do keep in mind if you decide to do the \"One bowl, One trip\" deal you can take your food with you....but if you do the buffet....and eat in then you cannot take anything with you. This establishment is within walking distance of the Ultrastar Cinema and a great place to get a great meal before you see your show. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy eating here.  Where else can you play with your food and not get in trouble?  Don't forget to purchase your doggy bag before you leave the register ($0.50)!  Trust me, you'll need it.    Yummy Asian food that you can make anyway you like!  Make sure to use more meat than you think you have if its your first time.  It is afterall the amazing shrinking meat.  Lots of choices in meat, vegetarian options, noodles, and sauces.  Once your plate is cooked, you can head over to get some rice or ice cream too!  This meal typically last three days for us.  And for $10!  The only reasons it did not get 5 stars from me is it isn't always quick service at the cooking stations and buffet area tends to get messy if not frequently checked on.  But it is a buffet, so I guess that is expected."}
{"text":"Best time to go is lunch time so you can pack your bowl so full of deliciousness!!! I usually pack enough for 2 cartons so I can eat lunch, dinner AND lunch the next day. They are always have fresh tasting food and they workers are so nice and they love to help you with anything you need."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years....  Pro's - variety on bowl options many - quality of produce good - staff friendly and helpful  Con's - maybe a tad over priced by $1 or so.  Never liked the new smaller metal bowls.   Will continue visiting from time to time..."}
{"text":"Heaven in a hot bowl!  I've been coming here for 15+ years and everyone I bring become immediately addicted.  Once you learn how to make your bowl the way you like it, you are set"}
{"text":"My family and I come here once every month or two. It's a fun concept to actually make your own bowl, your own sauce and watch it be cooked. The food is always tasty and we always have leftovers which actually heat up the next day quite well. I would have given 5 stars but you have to pay for your leftover containers and I think this is silly given the bowls are pretty pricey to begin with. If their takeout containers are that costly to them, shop for a new provider?"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my co workers and I am so GLAD I went. As soon as we walked in they were super friendly said hello and helped me through their selection. Then we walked over to the line of food to start filling out bowls. Wow they had quite the selection of vegetables and protein even tofu. As we got closer to the sauces a very nice lady, Janet helped me with putting my perfect sauce together and let me tell you it was the perfect taste. Then we took our food to the grill and they started cooking away which was done very quick and the gentlemen was also very nice. All around this by far has been a great experience.  Food was delicious Presentation looked great Staff was friendly  Fast but quality service   I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Tasty. Great healthy options. The hostess was delightful and extremely helpful. I went in for lunch, got the large and had enough leftover for dinner. I wish it was closer to home, but will be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We love this place!  My kids beg to come here and every time we do everyone is full, happy, satisfied and has leftovers for lunch the next day.  The new remodel looks awesome.  The elevated tables are super cool and my kids loved sitting at them.  If you've never been I highly recommend this place.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Real bang for your buck. If you don't know how to make your sauce then I highly suggest asking for help. Staff is super friendly - don't forget to tip and food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and absolutely love this place. If you have never been just know that the raw food looks like a lot but it cooks down to about half the size so pack the food in. You get to make your own sauce I recommend the chiefs choice thats my favorite and I add some of the spicy thai sauce to give it a little kick its not too hot."}
{"text":"I was contacted by owner to apologize for the meal below, even though it was not necessary to do so. My family didn't think anything wrong was done on YC's end, just a bad luck timing. So when I got a reply it was not expected, but we greatly appreciate him in doing so. They go above and beyond for their customers and should be thanked! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that this is the first negative review I've ever felt compelled enough to write after eating at hundreds of restaurants with my girlfriend. Also, as a server for multiple years I know what it takes to give good service. I visited with my girlfriend at 8pm, on October 23rd. I had already eaten dinner and was just going for a quick bite for my girlfriend after her shift at work. We go in and get greeted by a tired sounded host. I still gave him a 20 percent tip because I know how hard work can be sometimes. The total came out to 16 dollars! 16 dollars seems a little pricey for chicken and noodles but it's okay because it was only place nearby and she was hungry. After sitting down and letting her eat a bit, I get a fork to try a bite of her food. Once again, I already ate so I'm not hungry just wanted a bite and I get told, \"if you want to buy a bowl you can but don't eat off hers. WTF. The only time I am spoken too for my 20 percent tip is an inconsiderate comment about not be able to try my girlfriends food I paid for. Again I work in the food industry and I know sometimes there's bs rules but there has to be a better way to word that to someone who just tipped you. Ex, I'm sorry to say this sir but company policy says you can't share food, thank you. Well I was offended and my girlfriend knew so she just asked for a box. The same 'friendly man' let's her know that we usually have to charge for this but just this once he will give it to her for free. Like what. This is a consumer world so I urge all the consumers reading this to take your money elsewhere where it is valued. Believe me, I live in this area and there are about a million other places that treat you better than this. And you get more food at a cheaper price! Never again.  UPDATE: the owner has reached out and offered to make it up to me for the visit. I'm impressed with how quick they responded.  UPDATE: I finally decided to give the place a second shot and it was awesome!!!! The staff was super friendly and helped accommodate with sauces. I left my original review because I think it's important to learn from their mistakes."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, good  protein and veggie choices and sauce options to make your stir fry your way, including the drink, soup and fro-yo what is not to like for $10.75. You will not leave here hungry and you will have plenty for leftovers. I will be back."}
{"text":"Been to multiple Mongolian bbqs around California and Nevada and this is by far the best. The ability to add as much meat (chicken, beef, Turkey, pork and fish) as you want not to mention the unlimited veggies puts this place above others.  They also give you the ability to make your own sauce recipes. You can choose curry, sweet and sour, teriyaki, soy sauce combos, amongst others. This plus the unlimited drinks makes this place stand above the rest.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lots of variety. Yummy sauces to mix. Excellent staff. Great prices"}
{"text":"Well if you are good at packing food into a bowl, then you'll love this place. You can order a large or a small bowl... which I think you still can get as much as a large bowl if you pack enough into a small bowl. But anyway, you go through a buffet style line, stuffing meat, veggies and noodles into a bowl before they stir fry it for you. At this location, you start with the meats. There are beef, white chicken, dark chicken and Alaskan Cod. Compare to other places, the meat selection is quite limited. Even though vegetables which include tofu, baby corn, carrots, broccoli, bean sprouts, etc., are also a limited selection. There are a variety of sauces that you can mix or you can follow the recipe on the menu.  I guess the good thing is for $11, you can get a huge bowl of food. And there's free soup, which is ok... but you do also get a free drink (tea, soda) and you can buy yogurt for one dollar! So for the amount of money you pay, you get a lot of food. So I would say it's a good place to go for food. Just do it when it's not busy so you have more time to pack your bowl with ingredients. Be sure to make a mountain, get a lot of meat, a small portion of vegetables and keep piling whatever else on until it literally starts falling out of the bowl. LOL. And then you'll get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Love ycs! You can get more food if you get it to go from the start, they will give you containers for soups, chips and rice plus all your food in to-go containers, whereas if you eat there, you have to buy doggie bags."}
{"text":"Best place to eat Mongolian grill food...you can load up a bowl, have them cook it as long as you want, and it is always delicious, cheap, and super super filling.  I love to gorge myself at this place.  The location in Gilbert and the one in Scottsdale are both excellent as well.  The place is always spot-on delicious!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food here. My co worker is a vegan and the chef cleaned the hot plate off before cooking his tofu on it. I strongly suggest coming here. Around noon it gets kind of crazy in there but the staff and facility can handle the rush. I suggest the chicken woth udon noodles and broccoli and get creative with the sauces at the end. The staff can help you but if you like to make your own go for it."}
{"text":"Just happened to be passing by and decided to try this place. So glad I did. The food is great, the selection was great and the staff is friendly and very helpful. Don't pass this delicious meal up."}
{"text":"Totally awesome food and great staff. The food was as fresh as can be and they are very conscientious about food allergies. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give five stars, however, one of the best reasons why I came here to eat was because they had caffeine free DIET soda. I don't drink caffeine after noon and I could come here and fix my food that way I want too and also have a bubbly drink.   I was shocked when they had no caffeine free diet soda. I asked and the management recently changed form Coke to Pepsi products and out went the caffeine free diet soda. So they do not have s price for dinner that doesn't include the drink. So I paid for something I didn't drink. Also no soda water.   While I love making my own food and the fresh veggies and quantity you can make, I probably won't be back for lunch or dinner. This place was founded on health and healthy choices. So I say offer a wide variety of drinks for all and not just some.  I was extremely disappointed on this visit"}
{"text":"most mongolian grills allow you to decide how to eat your single-bowl (no refill) order.    instead of following this custom, yc's prohibits \"sharing\"  not only does their large chalkboard announce this prohibition upon entering, it also says \"TELL THEM TO GET THEIR OWN!\"  i would never be so rude to my date.  for $10.95 for one bowl (this perhaps the highest priced mongolian grill i have seen) i should be able to \"share\"  i questioned the cashier about this policy and was told \"our sales are based on the number of bowls we can sell to our customers..so we don't allow sharing\"  amazing...  you can, however, get the portion to go...  so, we had to get the portion to go and eat it outside and away from the yc's.   please take down your rude message (and lower your price) or i'll never return."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of YC's! I love the wide variety of options for your bowl and the wonderful sauce options. I particularly like the soups, rice and chips with sweet and sour sauce!! I could eat bowl after bowl of those chips with sauce!!! I am literally getting hungry as I write this review...  I didn't give YC's 5 stars for 2 reasons. 1 is that their prices keep going up. I swear everytime I go the price for a bowl has gone up. I think the last time I was there for dinner a bowl was $11.50. The other reason is that you have to pay for a to-go box!! I think that is a total rip off!!!  Other than that, YC's is great and delicious. I would recommend for a filling lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this location for years. The staff have always been helpful and friendly. As much as I enjoy eating my food there, I enjoy it even more as cold leftovers the next day once the spice has fully settled into the meat. Well worth what you pay for. With the to-go box (sometimes I need two for my leftovers), I can get between 2-4 meals out of one trip here. The food quality is also good for the price and the flavor is up to you, so if you don't like the flavor, it's more on you than on them. Overall, this is a place I'd recommend."}
{"text":"The food is yummy and I would come back just for the exceptionally friendly and helpful service! Great place to be gluten free and kid friendly."}
{"text":"When I was the young age of 3, my mom brought me to YC's. I have been going ever since. This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their \"grill warriors\" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless. Their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful. Not to mention, it is very affordable. I highly recommend everyone to \"mongo\" at YC's Mongolian Grill!"}
{"text":"I have come here several times and have never been disappointed. The food is fresh and just incredible. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. If you want a good Mongolian grill this place is perfect. Good price and great food. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"What do you expect from a Mongolian grill? If I go a Mongolian grill, I am looking for lamb. But they don't have it. So without lamb, a small bowl over 10 with tax is overprice for me. Drinks, rice and soup are free. But rice and soup taste so crap. I guess if you put all meat and press them very dense in a bowl, then you will feel it's worthy. ( I saw a guy was doing that...) But I was there for more veggie.  The food is fresh, but lack of flavor. Although they put the recipes on the wall, it's still lack of flavor. I have to add more chili and soy sauce after I taste it, but it doesn't have the flavor.   The service is great, very friendly. Location and parking is very convenient."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was really good. The sauces and food are very fresh! The only downside is the $1.00 for some take out boxes because if you can eat the whole meal then I am impressed. Also once You pick out your food you watch them cook it, cool idea."}
{"text":"You all know what to expect from Mongolian right?  I mean there are a million reviews below me carefully articulating how you can load up your bowls like it's the Cove of Corruption for shameless gluttoners or gluttonees ...so why this review?  Well...while every other Mongolian grill out there is looking to compete via different sauces, meat over ice instead of frozen, or who's grill stick is longer, YC's decided to take it old school with some good ol' customer service.  This isn't just a customer service experience, these people have it down.  They offer what they can instead of wasting time explaining what they can't, they make an effort to say hello and goodbye, and the best part? It's not overbearing either. Let's just say even if you hypothetically brought someone from the complain capital of the world (Boston) the complaint box would be empty.  /rant  YC ftw!  Btw, isn't Mongolia a starving nation whose citizens can't  even afford the luxury of a grill, much less a tower of meat and uncooked noodles? Irony...at least we know it tastes sweet."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. An inspiration. So good. Staff here is always great and the food never disappoints. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Add then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.  I have seen this type of grilling in the mall before but never actually felt the urge to dine there. I came here with friends who walked me through the experience. First of all, it is a stand alone restaurant. When you enter the door you pay $9 for the bowl and $0.50 for a togo box for your leftovers.  For the quality of food,  I think $9 is over-priced.  You are really paying a premium for the \"experience\" of watching someone sloosh around your food on a grill.  It is the express version of benihana.  You walk up to a buffet line and the first thing you see is a box of wax paper.  Those little squares they use when you get donuts.  You grab a couple sheets and proceed to the assorted meats (chicken, beef, pork) and a white fish (cod??) which were all frozen. These items are usually used for chinese hot pots. The quality is mediocre. Next in line are assorted veggies, tofu, and then an array of sauces.  You pick and choose.  As you fill up the bowl, people are using those wax sheets to moosh down the food to maximize space.  Add an item then smoosh.  Repeat.  The meal comes with soda, soup, rice, and frozen yogurt machine.  The best part of the meal was the service.  They are continually replenishing the ingredients and ensuring a cleaning station.  The cashier walked around to check on everyone's meal.  She even offered someone a new bowl since they didn't care for their creation.  That is service!  So even though the food was eh, the service made up for it."}
{"text":"YC'S is just wonderful. I have been going here for years & was so excited when they opened the Germann location! I recommend creating your own sauce & adding lots of their yummy tofu. Also- be sure to pile your noodles on very high!"}
{"text":"The Ycs format for you to select the content (meat, veggies, noodles) and then the sauce elements can seem intimidating to folks that are cooking challenged.    The folks will be very happy to assist you with the selections.  It is very easy and fast.  They like you to load up your bowl (press it down with all your strength).  The flat round cooking surfaces that they cook on are very hot....thus you food will be very hot. Your finished dish comes in a bowl, then to the small buffet for rice(Brown or white), soup, and crispy noodles.  Do not let the size of the bowl fool you, if you have an extra moment watch the experts in front of you.  My wife has never been one to eat Asian chow, we now visit YCs 2 times a week.  We end up taking home half for a second meal."}
{"text":"This place is a definite worth while visit and eatery. Choose from unlimited meats, veggies, noodles and sauce, take it the grill and magic happens. There also an ice team dispenser. My all-time favorite place. Highly recommend for those Mongolian grill lovers."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to YC'S Mongolian Grill and I had a great experience. I walked in and was greeted by Maria and when asked if I had ever been here before I explained that I hadn't.  Maria then walked me through the process and made sure that I had everthing that I needed.  Unfortunately I found a hair in my food but Maria came by and appoligized for the hair and asked me I wanted to start over.  End of story, right. Wrong, Maria brought me a card for a free meal and when I explained that I didn't need that and wasn't looking for that she told me that was exactly why she gave it to me. I will be visiting here again, and the food was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"make your own! mix beef chicken and noodles and a few veggies! and then create your very own flavor!.   i get the large bowl and a to go box. fill it with beef and push it down with the wax paper. and keep stuffing meat in to the top. the pile on some veggies and pile up a huge mound of noodles! my bowl sits aleast 12-16 inches high!! but the key is to go and grab another lg bowl up where they make your food! this bowl you fill with your own sauce!! then hand them both bowls and its on!!! if you do it the way i said you will have a bowl and a to box filled to the rim! and eat it all day lol"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I like how the chicken was cut in very thin....shaved flakes?  Anyways, I liked the thinness and I didn't have any qualms that it wasn't cooked enough or anything.  Tons of veggie options, and the girl working was so helpful when it came time to pick out the sauce.  The chef's favorite or YC sauce is pretty good.  Nice all around sauce, not too off the wall but still a good mix of sweet and sour and teriyaki.  I like both, so it was perfect.  The win tonight chips and ice cream cones are an added bonus!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. If you want fresh, healthy food...this is the place. It's always clean. It's fun stacking your bowl high and watching them cook it in front of you. Here's a tip to maximize your bowl space - after you smash the meat slide it up on the side of the bowl so your veggies don't fall off. Also, mix your sauce in a separate bowl. Last thing, you can ask the chef to cook your food longer on the grill or not add so much water or whatever your preference is to really customize your meal."}
{"text":"This is my spot when I am extremely hungry, want something quick but still sit down, and want something with noodles. I went here for about 3 years of my 4 years living in Arizona and it never seemed to disappoint. The service is always fast, and friendly so it made me come back. The food is awesome and the sauce mixing is interesting because you can really become very creative with what you choose as your ingredients to add to make your sauce.  I find the food here to have a lot of flavor, the sauces unique, and the setting inside is a standard set up with booths/ dinning tables around the restaurant. If you are looking for something a little more formal this is not the spot to-go but for a quicker bite on a budget but hungry it is perfect. The price is appealing, the food is excellent, the set up is casual so it is hard for me to say anything negative. It is one of the places I truly miss now that I am no longer in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Great service - super helpful staff from beginning to end.  I think I was asked at least 5 times if I need anything.  The food was good and the options were great"}
{"text":"Kinda pricey but you determine how much food you get; and you can get a ton if you really stuff the bowl so it's worth it"}
{"text":"I love the premise of Mongolian grills, but this one was just ok. I have definitely had better, and think that the placement of the sauce combination cheat sheet could have been better. (I didn't see it until I had already handed over my bowl for grilling). Having been to other Mongolian grills, I was able to put together something tasty, but if I had actually gone by the sauce guideline board, I would have felt comfortable trying something different. I went with veggie-only because I wasn't all that impressed with the meat presentation. The meal was alright, nothing spectacular and nothing foul. I'd give it a C-."}
{"text":"This is a great YC's, their service and management were great! We came in with a ton of kids after a movie and we were taken care of so well.  I love the selection and quality and their sauces are the best, way better than any other MG in the valley.  The chef's soup was out of this world, through a few wontons on it, dang! Thats whatsup!"}
{"text":"I'm Asian so I guess my expectation is a tad higher. The customer service was awesome!! The noodle was kinda bland but I loved that chicken vegetable soup."}
{"text":"I've been having lunch here for 6 years now, sometimes several times a week! Although I don't enjoy the constant price hikes or the awkward POS system that makes you feel guilty for not tipping, I absolutely love the food and the staff. In particular Myrra! Easily one of the nicest people I've ever met... anywhere!   Thanks YC'S!"}
{"text":"This is my daughters favorite place to eat when she comes to visit from CA. I brought her here a few years ago and she loves it! Their prices are fair. They have a wide variety of veggies and protein. We always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My sis and I took the parental units to lunch yesterday, and dad was curious about this Mongolian Grill stuff.  This location is in the Supertarget shopping center in the corner by Radio Shack.  Parking close the location is limited, but the large parking lot for Target is right there.    When you enter, you pay up front for a kids, small, or large bowl.  Large is $9 and comes with entree, drink, soup, rice (white and/or brown), wonton chips and dip, and @ dinner you get soft serve ice cream (lunch time, it will cost you $1).   So you go down the line choosing your meats, veggies, noodles, and finally a recipe for your sauce.  The employees have been available and very helpful each time we come here.   They even put my parents sauce recipe together for them.  At the end of the line, cooks fry up your concoction on round hot grills.    Suggestion:  if you like a lot of meat, grab a bunch and smoosh it down with the wax paper.  The meat cooks up really small because it is cut so thin.  Don't be afraid to pile on the veggies and noodles.  And ask questions to find out which sauce you might like; there is everything from sweet to savory to spicy.    Be prepared to take a doggy bag home, but they do charge 50 cents for one.  The good thing is this food warms up so well in a sautee pan the next day!  The favors have time to blend together and makes it even tastier!  This place has the added benefit that you know EXACTLY what you are putting in your entree, so you know what you are eating."}
{"text":"Do you like fresh veggies?  Do you like your meat cooked on a mongolian grill?  Do you like to experiment with your type of sauces?  Then YC's Mongolian Grill is just for you!!  I love this place! I have been a fan for many years, and now it's just right around the corner from my office, making it another fast lunch time place!  For this trip , I grabbed a large bowl and a to go box, put some beef in the bottle of the bowl, hit it with some great looking veggies, didn't skimp on the mushrooms or onions either, piled on the wheat noodles, drizzled some hot chili oil on top, sprinkled some cilantro and pineapples on it, in a smaller bowl hooked me up some spicy Hunan sauce (which I make a tab bit more spicier than whats on the overhead menu, gave it to the guy and watch the magic happen while my lunch was being prepared! Walked to the side, grabbed a bowl of brown rice and some fried won tons & sweet sour sauce!   At this point, I halved my rice & bowl of food into the to go box to make sure I have lunch for tomorrow and lunch for today! Can't beat that! 2 meals, one price! Just word of advice, if you think you might need a to go box, get it when you 1st pay, it makes things easier! I promise!  Yum Yum YCs, looking forward to the next time I come back!"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for the price but the restaurant is dirty and they charge you 50 cents for each to-go box."}
{"text":"If you know how to cook, you should have a good time at YC's. Your meal is basically what you make of it, and although the bowl may be on the medium side, you will shortly find that this makes for a huge meal. I could not even finish mine and had leftovers to take home. They encourage you to pile it as high as you can get it, then I added two bowls of sauce, one spicy and one Mongolian and it came out great. Perfectly sauced, and not thin and soupy like some have stated.   The only thing I didn't really like was the frozen fish, it just did not work well with the stir fry. Bonus if you are tired of take-out consisting of mostly bell pepper pieces and not enough meat, you can make your whole bowl consist of meat, sauce, and rice! (Not that I condone such behaviour).  I thought the ice cream was going to be an icy afterthought like most buffets, but it was actually pretty good so I had two like a big pig. I wouldn't call it gourmet but I would call it decent takeout quality."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner with the family.  It's very reasonable, considering all the food that you get.  It usually runs a little over 30.00 for the 4 of us, and includes the stir fry, all you can eat soup and rice, fountain drinks or tea and the dinner menu includes ice cream for dessert.  I love that each of us can create our own bowl and include the meats and veggies that we each like.  It is great for our picky kids."}
{"text":"Once again another great experience at YC's. This time I went to the original location in Tempe. While this location is smaller compared to the other locations It still offers the same great food experience. The employees were always making sure the tables were cleaned. Guests were being checked in quickly. It's nice that they ask if you have been Here before. If you haven't been to YC's before  the employees make sure to explain the process and how the sauces work.  Side note I like that you get a separate bowl for the Sauce.  In the past  you had to add it to your full bowl of food before it was cooked.  Make sure to check out the soups and ice cream. The ice cream is free  during dinner. For lunch there is a fee. Doggy boxes also cost .50 so just buy one when you pay for your food. You will need it."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! I love that you can build your own bowl. They offer lunch and dinner prices. For dinner the yogurt is included. This location is always clean. The staff is nice and they always greet you at the door. The line where you build your bowl is always tidy and looks pretty. The staff is always monitoring it to make sure everything looks good. The grill is always hot and they clean it often. So no old caked on burnt food from 2 hours ago. They offer doggie bags for .50. Trust me it tastes even better the next day too. Definitely a place that will fill you up."}
{"text":"What can I  say. The food is so delicious. I really like how you can go  to any YC's location and you will always get good food. Plus the restaurant is always clean. I really appreciate the high standards this restaurant sets. Everything is explained so if you are new to YC's you will know how the process works. But never be afraid to ask for help. The staff is so helpful. Plus they want to help. They have lunch and dinner service. Just know that the prices are different. I like going during dinner time because I can add the baby corn in my dish.  There are so many different sauce flavors to choose from. I always go with the teriyaki flavor. Don't forget the ice cream they offer with your meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds my husband and I of a Mongolian barbecue restaurant we use to frequent when we lived in Vancouver, Washington back in 2002.  This restaurant serves up a delightful array of proteins, vegetables, noodles, sauces, dry rubs, rice and fried won ton with sauces. You go down the line and build a bowl--large or small that you are handed at the register where you pay for the bowls. The meal includes a drink. There is huge grill where it's all cooked together. At the end by the grill there is brown and white rice, wontons and sweet and sour sauce for the won tons. Our waitress gave us each a cup to put frozen yogurt in as a treat from her. She was very friendly, welcoming and  nice. (The frozen yogurt is an extra $1.00 if you want to add it on to your meal). Our meal was delicious, hot and fresh. We enjoyed eating here. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They have great food and it's really fun to make.  They have large portions and great ice cream, unlimited delicious soup, chips, and all around great service!  Only complaint is that the ice cream machine is only open during dinner :("}
{"text":"I'm really bummed, Yelpers.  I spent a solid 8 years in New York City where, shockingly, they don't have Mongolian BBQ of any kind.  I might as well ask for a unicorn as much as ask someone for Mongolian BBQ.  Growing up, we used to go to this exceptional place in Virginia Beach called the Genghis Khan that was the benchmark for all of my subsequent mongolian BBQ experiences.  It was all you can eat, fresh, tasty and came with delicious soup and this crazy homemade sesame bread (I know - sounds weird from an Asian restaurant, but this bread recipe was super authentic to the region, apparently).  Long story short, my idea of Mongolian BBQ is apparently a far cry from YC's.  Don't get me wrong - the meat and veggies are fresh, the place is super clean and the service is quick.  But shouldn't all of that be a given?  The myriad sauce options are a bit overwhelming if you don't know what you're doing (I was ok saucing for myself, but my husband was confused - good places have a person whom you tell how you'd like it and then sauce for you).  Since the place isn't all you can eat, if you mess up your sauce on the first go, you're stuck with your dish.  Major bummer.  In addition, the whole concept of cramming as much food into a bowl as possible with wax paper and strategizing on how to get the most bang for your buck is really off-putting.  Shouldn't you be able to try different things, graze and casually eat without having to think out your choices like a friggin' game of chess?  Or have to worry about getting a doggie bag for later?  YC's should be a game show the way people scramble to fit as much as they can in a bowl.  The soups are odd - seemingly leftovers from the buffet mixed with broth and then called \"wonton\" or \"spicy beef\".  The crispy noodles were stale and tasted of used oil.  We didn't even bother with the frozen yogurt.  A friend who's lived here all his life heard of my search for good Mongolian BBQ and responded \"Why?  It's horrible.\"  I was kind of shocked given that a) he's a good eater and food critic and b) all of my collective experience having Mongolian BBQ up to my going to YC's had been so very good.  I just didn't understand.  Now I'm wondering if YC's is the area's benchmark for which all Mongolian BBQ should be compared to, maybe I should just give up.  It's just not that good at all, and this coming from the girl who'd break off both sets of arms and legs to have even a decent bowl of Mongolian BBQ at this point.  No fair, YC's. No fair."}
{"text":"Love this place. Gone here for years, as a casual lunch w/my dad.  Easy place to hangout w/free refills on soda/tea & soup/rice.  It's worth it to pay a few bucks for a to-go box.  Leftovers=another whole meal!"}
{"text":"I love me some Mongolian barbeque!   Real Mongolian though. This is very very close. But for some odd reason it never comes out as mouthwatering as the ones from the buffets do when its cheaper too!  So every time i go to a YCS (which is not usual now) at the back of my mind as i am eating i think why did i come here this is so expensive for something that isn't as great as another place that is 2-4 dollars less for all you can eat?! YCS even charges for a to go box REALLY?! REALLY YCS?? You want to charge me because i actually got somewhat full? You can expect my presence to be scarce! It is a disappointment to me really. I would rather pay for all you can eat with mouth watering quality Mongolian than someone who charges for every little thing. What are you gonna do next YCS? charge for a ladle of soy sauce?! Jiminey Christmas!   UGH"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Arizona! I come here every time I'm in Arizona!! Tons of options and love the wheat noddles!!!"}
{"text":"came in and all the staff had huge smiles and was so kind every time i get something different  love this place used to eat here 3 to 4 times a week  now its once a month wish i could come here more but that's how life happens"}
{"text":"This place is good but has gotten way too expensive.  We had a small bowl and large bowl which came to about $26. They even charge for take home boxes which is a gimmick because you're most likely not going to finish your food."}
{"text":"First, I want to thank the owners of this location for an amazing deal.  My husband and I recently moved to the area and received a coupon in a 'Welcome Wagon' type package.  We had never been to YC's and may or may not have stopped in but with the coupon we figured we would give it a try.  We were so amazed and pleasantly surprised.  The food was exceptional and the gal that helped us was so sweet and answered our questions.  Since it was our first time in, we weren't sure how things worked, she patiently explained and helped us out.  After we had sat down with our food and were eating she came by to check on us.  Everything was delicious and we will be back many many times.  The value for what you get is amazing.  Thank you for a great experience with food and service!"}
{"text":"Great place for Mongolian bbq. Pick the meat, noodles, veggies, & sauces. Fill your bowl over the top & watch them cook it. White & brown rice, 2 types of soup & wonton chips. You can get at least 2 meals out of it if you set it up right"}
{"text":"I have loved this place for as long as I can remember.  I mean, I even gave it it's own nickname: Mongo.  I can always tell when amateurs are in line, because they don't quite know how to smash the meat and other ingredients down to make the largest bowl of noodle goodness as humanly possible.  I know the recipe for my favorite Mongolian sauce by heart and I will drive many miles just to taste those warm noodles.  I know there used to be a few more choices of veggies and things on the line, but after talking to a manager, he told us about their rising food cost which caused them to have to take away some of the things that were previously offered.  Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to keep costs under control."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST places in the valley! It's been around for years, the ambiance is cool, family friendly, you can get it for take out, or dine in & either way you're gonna leave happy! The food is just so good!  Another AZ necessity, hands down"}
{"text":"i've been going here for years.  i've tried other places like this, but none of them add up. if you go at lunch, you can get 2 or 3 meals for 8$!  it also includes rice, crispy things, soup and a drink.  and then you don't have to eat the rest of the day. :) over time, i've created my own sauce.  the suggestions they give you are helpful, but its good to be creative and figure out what you like. you can get to-go boxes for $.50 and definitely worth it.  the only time you can't get one is with all you can eat option.  i can't understand why anyone would do that, i can hardly finish 1/3 of a bowl."}
{"text":"I've been bugging my boyfriend for months now to try out one of these locations. So happy we finally went. The service was good, good price, great selection. Didn't take long for the food to be cooked while we waited. Place was kept up and clean. My boyfriend said the cod was the best and next time that's all he's getting. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's definitely a restaurant that's worth the money! Always remember to get a box to go because you will not finish if you pile your bowl like a pro. I love the extras they give you at the end to put on top of your completed bowl. Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to try something new but we were very unsure what we were wanting so we thought we'd go with the whole Mongolian \"let's see them cook in front of us\" place. I yelped here and there and noticed this place has extensive reviews. 4 stars with lots of reviews is hard to come by now days.   We walk in and we bypass the register so the lady immediately followed us and asked if it were our first time (clearly).  They have an option of bowls but there is only a dollar difference between small and large (we went with large).   You start by selecting the food you want from a small bar with numerous amounts of meats and vegetables. After that you get to pick your own seasonings that'll highlight your dish. The person at the register helps you with all of these options and is really helpful. After all your desires have been chosen you get to see the cook, cook your meal in front of you.   Along with the meal you get to pick up rice and soup with a drink (if you have gotten the meal). Which is a pretty sweet deal. After  our meal (which we didn't finish) we asked for to-go boxes which you have to pay fifty cents extra but with this being our first time she let us have them for free.   Overall experience was amazing. We definitely will be coming back but with empty stomachs. ;)"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a very good Mongolian BBQ because they are rare. The vegis are fresh, sauces are very delicious. My second time there they were extremely busy and the food piled around the grills was disgusting and wasteful. Staff is very friendly and helpful, could not ask for better people. I could not help but wonder since the sauces and every bin was so deep that how often they are changed or is fresh constantly piled on top. Food is still wonderful! The not so Yum is the frozen dessert, it has a very weird taste to it and I skipped it second time there, that is how nasty it tastes. Other places have dairy free and cones. Maybe this has some strange ingredient that I cannot choke down which is rare also."}
{"text":"YC's makes me happy. It will make you happy too. I've been a customer for 25+ years. The joy began at this very location, McClintock and Southern... this loc is the OG baby! Now the romance continues at the, more convenient, Power and Ray location. The quality is the same at each location... I know... I'm experienced.  Tasty, healthy, fun.  When I go I make certain I will have leftovers for the next few days. I am a YC's stacking engineer, Jedi level. I'm not going to detail my process, but the order and compaction of the foods you add to your bowl are key to maximizing your leftovers.  My YC's sauce preference: 4 ladles of YC's own 2 ladles of Spicy Hunan 2 ladles of Ginger 2 ladles of Garlic 3 seconds of Sesame Oil 8+ seconds of Chili Oil A generous amount of Sesame Seeds  Build your own joy. Go to YC's and be happy."}

{"text":"First time visiting YC's on a recommendation from my daughter. I really really liked it because I could make my own bowl of whatever it is I wanted in there. The meat selection looked weird because its very thin shaved meat but I can do without the meat. The variety of sauces was great and you can even come up with your own sauce. The young lady at the counter was very nice and helpful after I told her that it was our 1st time there. She walked us thru the whole build our bowl process and even helped with our sauce selection. Without her help we would have been lost. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I would like to say that the owner/manager does know how to run a business and make right on misunderstandings. My kids love this place and always have a great time putting together their own specialized meal! The portions are huge and very delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool concept. Prices are great. I will be back. Only thing I didn't understand is why they charge for Togo boxes."}
{"text":"People with food allergies unite! There is finally a restaurant that understands us! I simply cannot say enough good things about this place or their staff.  My wife likes Asian food cannot eat most of it due to being allergic to ginger, mushrooms, and honey.  When we walked in, it was clear that we were new to the restaurant. An employee walked us through the process and asked about food allergies up front. When my wife explained her allergies the employee went through the line, item by item, and told her what she could eat and could not eat.  That was a huge help and welcome change.   Additionally, when you tell them that you have food allergies they give you a little placard to put on your tray and the person on the grill cleans before putting your food on and will not make any other foods on it until yours is done.   At YC's you actually assemble your sauces yourself from a few items they have available and they provide a breakdown on how to make the sauce. For example, for an orange chicken sauce it is 4 scoops of orange, 1 of garlic, 1 ginger, and 1 cooking wine.  In my wife's case, she is allergic to ginger so she got to leave that out. Done.   The prices a reasonable, the portion sizes are huge, the staff are super helpful, it's quick, and the food is good.   The only complaint I have is that is the soup is WAY WAY WAY too salty. It's completely inedible and I hope they fix that.  However, the customer service was so wonderful for a couple with allergies that I don't care and that it will not impact this 5 star rating."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have allot of veggie options and three different noodle types. Your order comes with a drink, soup and rice. The staff is very friendly and they have allot of sauce option. They also give you a separate sauce bowl. I love that they have four fresh brewed tea options!!!"}
{"text":"I found Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ to be decent, but not great. I'd go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice. That said, it's pretty good for Asian food in the greater Phoenix area. I've noticed a trend when it comes to people rating Asian food on Yelp! Those people from the area seem to rate the food much better than those people that are transplants. I was excited to try this place because it was a \"mongolian bbq,\" however it doesn't hold a candle to the B.D.'s Mongolian BBQ in Royal Oak, MI where I'm originally from."}
{"text":"I just love this place. Every time you go you can put a new twist on your meal by changing up the make-up of your sauce.   I always get a small bowl. You can still get way too much food and save money all at the same time."}
{"text":"First time at YC's, had been to other Mongolian BBQ style places, none as \"upscale\" as this. Most of the Mongo places I've been are in the mall fast food court, or in a small strip mall. This place made us go WOW as to how big it was and all the food you get for about $11 a person for dinner.  To go boxes are 50 cents, super reasonable considering you can really cram a lot of food into your bowl to get cooked. I was actually shocked that they suggested you pack the food into your bowl to get more space! Staff was friendly and even helped us out with mixing the sauces.  This place is super close to our house and we will definitely be back frequently."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to go to eat. You put whatever you want into a bowl and it is cooked to your liking!  What could be bad here?  Well.... their prices!  As I mentioned a few years ago their prices constantly raise, and nothing has changed!  Their prices are borderline ridiculous, I hope they slow down, because they are going to potentially lose a lot of customers!  This place is really becoming very, very $$$$$"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here, I have been to other DIY style restaurants and those usually make you pay per the weight of the food. I love that you can get as much or as little food as you want for the same price. I always cram my bowl as full as possible and get a take out box so I can enjoy my stir fry leftovers later on. The staff are always attentive and have no problem helping you out if you are unsure of what sauce to mix up. The restaurant is always clean and the food is always fresh. There are few restaurants that I would rate 5 stars, but I can't say enough good things about this place. I will be a customer for life!"}
{"text":"This place is great! You fill your bowl with raw meat, vegetables, noodles and sauce - they cook it for you, and you can fill up on sides like soup, rice, crispy wonton chips and more! Location isn't great, and the dining room is a tight squeeze, but the staff is great and more than willing to help out with whatever you need! Be sure to go at dinner for the \"prime\" offerings!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!  I am so impressed.  They have Mongolian down to an art form.  When I walked in, I explained that it was our first time there.  She explained how everything worked and even told us that for .50 extra we could take our food home in a to go box.  I was super excited because most of the time, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I end up wasting half my meal.    The food was super fresh and delicious.  They even have someone to help you get the right sauce combination to ensure that your meal is done exactly right.  Rice and soup is included in your dinner.  Still hungry after?  They have frozen yogurt to satisfy your sweet tooth.  My family loves this place and we will definitely be back as often as possible.  SO HAPPY!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, manager on duty was excellent. Place was clean and it was a nice atmosphere.  This is one of our favorite places to go. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Gotta say if I didn't have my older sister with me who's been here before, I wouldn't have know all the little secrets about getting more food for your money. Loved the white chicken meat, and loaded up with plenty of veggies. I chose the teriyaki sauce, and I am glad that I did. It was fantastic. I was impressed by the way that it was prepared. The food was fresh and delicious, and a small was very feeling. Plenty to choose from when it comes to combination of foods and sauces. I am looking forward to coming again, and trying something new! Thanks sis for a new favorite place added to the list."}
{"text":"I've got a broken ankle so I'm staring at my walls for way too many hours each day. My sweetheart's been concerned for his safety so he's getting me out & about at least once a week. We (*I*) decided we should start trying out new places for food.  Last night he asks if I've ever been to a YC's. He'd been to one in CA years ago. I hadn't, so I checked out the reviews here, liked what I saw (especially the fact they were still open... Sunday night & I was starved!). Also found out it's less than a mile from home so even better... food... NOW!!  ** THE SERVICE **  Went in on crutches & the gal asked if we'd been there before... no, we haven't. We ordered 2 large bowls. She explained how it all works, even showed us how (& encouraged us) to smash as much food as we can into the silver bowls.   When we got to the spices, she came back & explained the menu board (if you find a mixture you like, you can repeat it the next time), asked me what flavors I preferred, & proceeded to help me (I told her what I liked... she put it in the bowl).  Once I had my all my ingredients, she carried my tray to the grill area for me & went back to help my man navigate the spices.  The guy at the grill tossed everything on top & started mixing it all together. It's always fun to me when I get to watch people cook my food!! I get to see how it's done (I suck as a cook but it's nice to know it CAN be easy!) & I know exactly where my food's been before I start eating... a win-win in my book!  In less than 4 minutes, I had a huge bowl of piping hot Asian food in front of me!! The nice gal came back & carried it to my table, got me 2 bowls of rice, a cup of iced tea, & an extra one for refills so I wouldn't have to have my man chase down more for a while.  NOTE: Don't expect this type of service!! As I said, I went in on crutches. Even then, I was still amazed at the extra help. I loved it because my man didn't have to keep interrupting his meal to make sure I had what I needed!!  ** THE FOOD ** I just can't say enough. The food is super fresh. The meats are shaved so you're not dealing with the chance of fat/grissle/ick that you sometimes run into at Asian food restaurants (yep, that'll ruin meals for me). You pick exactly the veggies you like (this is the first time EVER that I've had Asian food & haven't had to pick thru my food & end up throwing away half my meal!!).  AND, you get exactly the flavors & heat level you want. We're both super spicy people. But no matter where we order \"extra spicy\", we just don't get it. That didn't happen here! We both used the chili oil to what she called a \"level 8\" & you could actually taste the spice (next time I'm sure we'll be doing a 9 or 10, but it was really good at the 8 too).  ** PORTIONS ** I thought we'd done a good job at stuffing our bowls. But after seeing what others were doing, I know we can do better next time! LOL  But even with what we did, the bowls were full. He ate all of his... he's one of those guys who likes to feel full when he goes out & he was more than full when he finished. I ate about a third of my bowl & brought home leftovers that'll be good for another 2 meals for me!  They offer both brown & white rice. They have soup which I can't comment on since neither of us had any. And they have soft serve ice cream if you save room for dessert (how can you NOT save room for ice cream?!?). I got the twist kind with one of those tiny cones... VERY good!  ** CLEANLINESS ** The place was super clean. One of the gals was training a new gal & was literally wiping down ALL the walls. The tables were all clean. The guy at the grill was constantly cleaning the cooking area between customers. Everything you want in a food place!  ** PRICES ** Between the 2 bowls & the tip, we paid $30 for dinner. When I asked the gal for a takeout box, she let me know they normally charge 50 cents for them, but since it was our first time (so I didn't know to ask), she gave me one. For the amount of food, I'll pay the 50 cents!  We saw on the way out that we could get \"Unlimited\" for $1 more. We'll do that next time so he can have leftovers too!!  ** SIDE NOTE ** I asked my son this morning if he'd ever been to a YC's. He likes Asian food, but he's a super picky eater (aka doesn't eat any vegetables). So I figured it'd be an awesome place for him to go since he can pick and choose what's in his meal.   His text back to me? \"It's f***in' amazing!\" Really? He knew about this place and didn't tell me? I fired him as my food advisor!!  ** BOTTOM LINE **  We will definitely be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"The people here are super friendly. They definitely will help you out on how to make sauces and also any other questions you might have. I'm just a little surprised on how expensive YC is now. I haven't been here for years, so I'm not too surprised now. The only thing that kind of irks me is that they charge you 50 cents for a to-go box and it's not even the super big boxes, it's the small one like for Chinese takeout. That makes me force to eat everything on my plate and I would have love leftover Chinese food for the next day. Other than that, the food is still good."}
{"text":"While the food tasted good, my date and I BOTH walked away with food poisoning from here on Sunday, June 24th.  So that was awesome."}
{"text":"YC's is Yummy! Choose whatever you want for meats and veggies, then whatever combination of sauce you want on it, and they wok it up for you! I always buy a to-go container for 50 cents because it is a small price to pay for another meal and I always end up with extra. I recommend the wheat noodles, they are really good. The meal includes crunchy wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce, soup, white or brown rice, and frozen yogurt at the end. Its a good deal for the money! :)"}
{"text":"We went here on Valentines Day for a girls night out (being single doesn't mean you have to be miserable!), it was my first time at a YC's! Another friend of mine went to the one on Elliot, and she raved about it to me. I completely forgot until we went here on the 14th!  We arrived before they closed, what's nice is that they let you eat your fill if you don't pull a dick move and arrive at 8:45pm to eat with a large group. I'm not a big fan of buffets, after visiting one with my family in California, I became completely discouraged with the rampant shouting kids, claustrophobic tables and chairs that made you turn sideways to walk down isle, and some of us ended up with food poisoning since the waiters weren't keeping the place clean - but YC's has given me a good outlook on family sit-down buffets. At least, arrive after 8pm so parents have to take the kids home for bed on a weekday haha!  After paying we walked down the line, a lot of people were piling it up, my friend helped me figure it out which was really simple. The girl at the cash register was nice also and helped with the instructions on how to get the food.  One thing I really loved about YC's was that above the area where they fry your food up, there is a huge chalkboard on all the different Asian sauce mixes you can have for your dish! I ended up making Curry-yaki, and it was REALLY good, it reminded me of eating in a Japanese food court while in California!  YC's is a clean place, not loud and obnoxious after 8pm on a weekday, and people are polite while you're waiting for your food in line. I want to try this place out again so you can count on me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Got here around 7pm, the cashier got to us fast, asked if we knew what to do, and we were on or way to snag some yummy Mongolion Grill food!!!  There wasn't a long wait in line to grab food, or a long wait for them to cook your food! The resturaunt is clean, and the interior is roomy and doesn't feel cramped. They have vanilla, chocolate, or the vanilla chocolate swirl froyo in a cup or cone included with your meal.  The on on McClintock can't compare, but they are usually backed up with families. Since this location is a little more \"hidden\" you can enjoy a quiet night with family or friends while you enjoy your meal :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try the place I ended up being early.  We paid our admission to the food funhouse that is YC's and then got down to business.  Armed with bowls the size of our heads, we stepped to the buffet and I got my first look at what I was up against.  The first third of the buffet is filled with shaved curls of frozen meat in various varieties.  Beef, Chicken, Pork, Alligator and Yak.  Frozen curls of Yak!  Okay so I lied about the Yak and the Alligator.  But you never know.  They SAID it was beef and chicken, but seriously, it could have been Yak!  I grabbed the tongs and threw a pile of meat in the bottom of my bowl.  I smiled at my accomplishment but she just looked over slightly concerned and then handed me a sheet of wax paper.  \"You need to smash it down.\" she said.  \"What?\" I replied? \"The meat,\" she explaind patiently.  \"You need to smash it into the bottom of your bowl.\"  \"But I'm not that hungry!\" I protested.  \"You will be and this is gonna last you for days.  See that guy on the end? Your bowl is supposed to look like that.\" She pointed towards the end of the buffet where I saw a towering mass of vegetables rising out of an already unfathomably large bowl.  It would easily feed a family of four.  His YC fu was impressive, but I was sure I could top that.  \"Get Smushing,\" she said as I refocused on the task at hand.  After I had pressed all the pretty curls of meat into a flat unrecognizable blob that filled the bottom half of my bowl, we moved onto the vegetables.  If you've had it in \"Chinese\" food, it was there.  I zeroed in on some celery, cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions and baby corn.  I piled it on with gluttonous abandon, gleefully shaping my mountain of food to resemble the peak from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  The last third of the buffet contains sauces.  Many many many sauces.  Get them, they are good.  They have recipes but seriously, who wants to read directions?  I needed more sauce than I took and I thought I took a lot.  It would have helped to know they were going to slap it on a grill and immediately start diluting it with water.  Seriously, I put like five or six scoops of various stuff in and it was still just barely sauced enough.  I supplemented with some spicy mustard.  So um.. then they cooked it, and we ate it.  Sure it was good.  Yes I still have leftovers.  No you can't have them.  Is the food here the best I've ever had? Hell no.  But it's pretty good for fast/cheap/healthy-ish stuff and seriously who cares? They let you play with it for like half an hour before you even sit down.  Score!"}
{"text":"My man likes it here. This place stresses me out.    If you have never been, you gather your ingredients and bring it to the grill for preparation.  I feel like I'm making a mess, and the bowls aren't big enough. I feel rushed by the people behind me. I can never make the concoction of sauce that tastes good.  Take out is a holy debacle.  If it were up to me, I would pass. But I undoubtedly will be visiting again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Stepped out side of my comfort zone and tried this with my daughter, I must say it was a pleasant Suprise, great food and very affordable, cooked to order tight in front of you. Will be back"}
{"text":"this place is my absolute fav and anytime i'm near it i must stop in...  you can pack so much food into their bowls you seriously have lunch for work for the next three days.  the variety of food changes on a day-to-day basis, so sometimes when i go they don't have my favorite things (baby corn, water chestnuts), but i manage to cram 6 feet of food in my bowl anyways...  their sauce choices are very good and the staff working can usually help you with it as it may get a little confusing...be sure to add lots of chili sauce if you want it hot...  you can also get rice, won tons, soup, and a drink with your dinner..which is a great deal for $10.   if you're seriously stoned, go in. you won't be disappointed. and you won't be able to put your fork down long enough to talk to your friends about it either!!!"}
{"text":"I don't like stir fry. This place has completely changed my opinion! My husband drove past this and we stopped out of curiosity. OMG it was absolutely delicious! It is almost like a buffet but it's ONLY stir fry. So you start at the beginning and load up whatever meat, veggies, noodles, etc that you want. You end up at a sauce bar where an employee will most likely help you out. There's like 12 different sauces and a recipe board if you want to follow their mixtures. I recommend the Calcutta Curry. We did the unlimited which was about $15 and we ate roughly 3 bowls each. Then we had soup and finished with some cheesecake frozen yogurt. Absolutely loved the atmosphere, food, and staff here!"}
{"text":"There was a place called JP Lee in NJ and we used to eat and I loved it. I thought I would never find it again, but then I did with YC's. Same shit.  Here is a couple of tricks.  Ask for water chestnuts during the day, they will get them from the back. Make the meal so much better.  Here is my Bowl of YC's Krunk Slop that I love:  Pork and Chicken in bowl Cover with onion and one scoop of wine pat down  put veggies on. I go for water chestnuts and Bamboo shoots Then 2 scoops: hunan thai yc's own soy garlic seame oil  sprinkle chili oil  put noodles on top.  (Egg noodles)  do all sauces again.  then put on the flat grill.  Tell them NO WATER.  Water dilutes the sauce and seasoning.    This is a must eat."}
{"text":"This was our first time at YC's and the hostess was very welcoming and helpful. She walked us through the bowl sizes, the food line, and helped me make my sauce as well. There is a board of sauce recipes to follow for the ingredients but for it being our first time it was very helpful that the hostess walked us through it. Once you have your bowl ready you hand it to the cooks and they make it right in front of you. Less than a five minute process depending on how busy it is.   They also have soup and ice cream but if you need a to go box it's an extra charge. Keep them in mind when picking your bowl size."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant to enjoy some time with friends or family! The vegetable items are fresh and they have a huge selection. The board of flavors has some wonderful selections and I would recommend the teriyaki sauce flavors. Don't forget the customer service is great! We will continue to drive 40 minutes to this place."}
{"text":"This has been my go to for stir fry for quite a while. The food here is always consistent and the only times it has been more questionable is purely based on my inability to choose the right sauces and ingredients to mix together."}
{"text":"A good place for Chinese Mongolian. You get as much as you can fit in the bowl. So push down hard and squash the meat down into the bowl. Pretty much build your bowl the way you want. You get your money's worth. The price includes meal, drink and ice cream."}
{"text":"I like coming here with a buddy of mine who does it best. He takes the bowl and forces so much meat in the bowl, the cook has to use two bowls after everything expands. I strive to do this one day, not an easy task! Awesome service, really fresh food with so many options!!"}
{"text":"The aroma drew me after leaving  the movies.  You get a bowl.  Choose a frozen meat.  Top it with seasoning salt of ur Choosing, veggies add that with a bowl of marinade. Rice or some sort of noodle.  Then u wait,  observe, collect your drink.  Sit and eat.   Then yogurt.  All under 12 bucks.  And so much to take home.  Very pleased with this find!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. I love being able to add whatever food I want myself with as much as I can pack into my bowl. They recognized it was my first time there and were helpful explaining how it all works, including help selecting the sauce. The price was a bit high but I was very impressed with the amount of food I got."}
{"text":"Taste was bland!  you are better off going to Genghis Grill instead.  YC's only has 3 meat choices and no seafood!  It was fresh, but flavorless.  You had to get the noodles in your bowl too so you get less here than you do at Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"This place is soooo delicious!!! And fun because you get to put together your own bowl. Fill it up as high as you can but don't let it overflow because they will only cook what is on the bowl. Service is amazing at this location, especially Alex-he's awesome!! Very helpful and friendly :) I highly recommend this place, you really get your money's worth!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazeballs and the staff is always kind. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they try to charge you extra for take out boxes, and they don't have that listed on the menu and don't mention it to you before you order the large size bowl. WHO DOES THAT?  rude. I already paid $12 for a plate. Next time I'm just going to grab my food by the handful, shove some in my pocket and walk out trailing wheat noodles behind me #nofoodleftbehind"}
{"text":"If you don't love YC's then we can't be friends."}
{"text":"Great food you can stuff your bowl as high as you want so come hungry.    They have vegetarian options but didn't care for the end result.   Little costly for Asian food."}
{"text":"Made a road trip from Cali to New Orleans. We were coming back and had to get gas and we were hungry yelped helped us, we were craving tacos and then we saw this place! Once we walked in we were greeted by the prettiest and friendliest girl there! We were also first timers and she explained every step! Which was super helpful! She told us multiple times to fill up our bowl as much as we can lol! She encouraged us to overflow our small bowl. When we got to the sauces she was extremely helpful and asked us what we were craving and what we liked whether it was hot,sweet ,sour or all the above. She explained everything and which was her favorite! But she also recommended the popular one too! Getting to the grill the chef was all smiles and cooked everything in your bowl. Once we got to our table we were ready to eat! Everything was favorable and delicious everything was Cooked! Can't wait to visit Arizona again to come here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here early on a Saturday morning to grab lunch, and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was clean, and we were greeted by a friendly hostess as soon as we entered.  She was very helpful answering the few questions we had, and then we moved on to the ingredient bar.   All the ingredients looked very appetizing, and the vegetables were fresh and nicely sliced.   They really have a great selection of seasonings and sauces.   16 sauces in all, so you can mix and match to your hearts content and come up with some fun stuff!  The cooking area was very clean, and the cook prepared the food quickly and cooked it just right.  The vegetables were cooked, but still just a bit crisp, and all the meat tender.    There's plenty of brown or white rice to go with the entree as well.   Really a nice place to stop and eat."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was very impressed. Super friendly and super helpful staff, when they asked if it was our first time there and we answered yes. The staff was super helpful showing us all the options and assisted with us choosing the sauce as well. They answered all our questions and were more than willing to help with any questions we may have had. Most people don't seem to like the.50 for to the Togo boxes, but I fully understand. So many options to choose from, pick your portions and  a great look and feel. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walk in. Pay the cashier roughly $13 a person. Grab a silver bowl, a tray and some paper to mush as many ingredients into said bowl as possible. What the!? Meats include: chicken (white and dark), pork, beef, and a fish option. Maybe I'm forgetting one...? Oh well....move along and shove as many veggies as you can and then smush and stack as many noodles as you can on top. Up next, grab another smaller silver bowl and fill with any kind of sauce creation you could think of. Luckily the staff are ready and willing to help make your sauce. Then carefully waddle over to the cook and watch him \"play hockey with your food\". That basically means he puts your creation onto a giant, bazillion degree hot surface and uses these paddles to cook it all to perfection. After being amazed by the cooking process, stumble to a table and eat! Also included in the price: soft drinks and iced tea, two kinds of soup with wonton crisps, and white or brown rice. Wait! I forgot there is also chocolate and vanilla ice cream available! Wooo! There is a 50 cent charge for a to go container if you want to take your leftovers. If it's your first time, the container is free.  I will acknowledge that I had an upset tummy after eating here but I'm willing to give it another shot as it could have been unrelated. I wasn't in too much pain....haha"}
{"text":"WOW! Food was so good! And you get so much! And extra free sides! What a hook up! Staff is SO nice & friendly too!! Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"By far the best experience I've had at any of these types of restaurants. I never feel like I know what to put together, particularly on the sauces. One of the employees here must have picked up on that, because she came over to ask me if I'd like help with the sauce. I said sure and she proceeded to ask questions about what we like. She came up with perfect combinations for me and my son. He ate his entire veggie stir fry, and mine was delicious. She came by while we were eating to make sure we liked them. We came in about an hour before closing and the restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and I was pleasantly surprised. Hopefully I'll remember her concoction for next time, because we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"my first time having Mongolian food, I was rather confused as to what to order and what to do. The lady at the register walked me through every step of the way and even made me a bowl of sauce. The place was beautiful, the staff was very nice. Loved it"}
{"text":"Very well priced because it includes soup, rice, drink and ice cream.  The food is whatever you make of it. If it tastes, bad, it's your fault. If it's good, it's your credit.  Usually very good. Service is very efficient."}
{"text":"I really like the mixture that I created and love the flavor that I put together in my bowl. Those guys who work at the kitchen they work hard, so I think they deserve some tips.  I noticed some of the customers were being greedy by putting so much food in their bowls and they didn't even finish it, what a waste.  Overall experience was great and yes we will comeback here again."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and you have sooo many options to customize your own bowl.  If you don't like it its your own fault since you made it lol.  So much food for your buck.  and it can be pretty healthy if you use the fresh veggies and you dont pack your bowl  with all noodles.  Hot tip: add a few shrimp for $1!!  My bf loves it since he is into the whole caveman thing and likes triple meat and they dont have a meat limit or charge extra for it.  Restaurant is always very clean.  Would recommend to everyone.  That whole shopping area is kind of dying out but this is its best kept secret.  Hopefully yc's is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Great food and tons of it. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They showed us how to pack the stuff in our bowl down with tissue paper so we could get even more."}
{"text":"Was brought here by a couple of friends who kept raving about the food.  My first and last time.  I begged them to try another place to compare.    The meat resembled rolled up frozen deli meat of poor quality.  Nothing fresh, very tasteless and dry.  The selection of veggies looked sad and very picked-over.  I was disappointed that there was not an option of adding an egg.  And the starch choice was noodles or plain rice, that's all.  Lots of choices of sauces but they still couldn't make it delicious.  But wait...  free frozen yogurt!  I could care less.  I eat at Mongolian grills for the Mongolian, not crappy generic soft serve.  And then to be charged for a to-go box?  That's ridiculous.  I will go to Genghis Grill instead.  Quality trumps quantity any day (not to mention actual service.)  Even the Mongolian Grill at the Banner Desert hospital cafeteria is better as far as taste and quality goes (not to mention WAY cheaper.)"}
{"text":"This place is great, all you can eat including a drink and frozen yogurt for $11 is hard to beat.  Everything looked fresh and none of the toppings looked like they had been sitting for more than a few minutes.  Cooking time is short and you can go back as often as possible.  Highly recomend for a quick bite that is good and filling"}
{"text":"I have tried every other mongolian bbq in the valley and none compare to YC's. It is just plain better. Price is right for the portion. I pay extra for the box and go nutts at the line and take home the extra. Meat is always the best quality, the veggies are always fresh. Though busy at peak times, they always get you through the line quick.   YC's needs a seafood night with lobster and shrimp etc. I'd pay allot more a coupel times a month to step it up.  As for the frozen yogurt, don't bother. They need to pick up the brand Sweet Tomatoes uses and add a little fixin bar and I would pay the extra for dessert."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Wednesday evening with my wife, her parents and her brother for dinner.  The inside of YC's Mongolian looks like like most Mongolian restaurants with a large buffet like bar, a couple of circular grills and then some seating.  How YC's differs from our Mongolian Grills back in Pittsburgh is that their meat is frozen and they also have mixed sauce suggestions.  If you have never been to a Mongolian grill before the premise is simple.  You are given a bowl that you fill up with whatever meats, vegetables and carbs that you want.  Then you pair a sauce with it and it gets cooked on the grill and handed back to you.  On this occasion I went with the unlimited bowl while my wife went with the large bowl.  All of my trips produced very similar items in the fact that I got chicken, beef, water chestnuts, broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers and pineapple.  The only differences between my bowls were the sauces as I twice went with Thai peanut curry and once missed their spicy sauce all while adding chili oil to each. All three times I ended up enjoying my bowl.  It's nice to be able to customize it to your own personal preferences.  By the time I left the restaurant I was incredibly satisfied and stuffed.  Then within an hour of finishing eating I had some issues and my wife had different issues the next morning.  Can I prove that they were YC's fault?  Nope I cannot, however, I have my suspicions.    The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't come to YC's again in the future.  While I was happy and satisfied with the food while I was there, I certainly wasn't later in the evening turning a 4 star review into 3 stars.  UPDATE:  The owner of YC's contacted me on Yelp the day after my review was posted .  He let me know that he was glad that we enjoyed our meal but sorry that we had issues afterward and that they take food safety seriously.  He also gave me a number to contact him.  That alone should show you that the owner does care about his establishment and what goes on their and gives me a much more favorable view of YC's."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Price was fabulous. Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean. Will be back regularly"}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap (for how much you actually get), and oh yeah, delicious.  I LOVE this place. I easily take home enough food for 3 meals. Great variety and nice people."}
{"text":"I love YC's!  This place is great.  While it was slightly confusing my first trip, I quickly caught on.  Pack your bowl with as much meat and veggies as you can.  Use the little paper strips to smash it down and then pile on the noodles, and invent your sauce.  I never go by any of the \"recipes\" they have listed.  I have fun just making up my own...lol.  The Spicy Beef soup is excellent.     I believe the price is $9 lunch and $10 dinner for which you get a serving of ice cream.   And you will have leftovers so just go ahead and get a to-go box for $.50 more.  My box is always filled to the top as if I hasn't eaten anything, but the reality is that I am stuffed and you just get so much food here.   Oh and it's not just that it's a good deal, the food is actually yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been going here for years. I have perfected the \"smash\".  They have lots of new options. Everything is always fresh and tastey.  The lines go very quickly and the management and staff are always so pleasant."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! great food and you pick what you want.  Help is avail if you dont know what you're doing... I have been here more than 10 times to this location and bet the other locations are the exact same.. Great place to get Mongolian BBQ"}
{"text":"The manager here is AWESOME, and the rest of the staff is really good. We love this place. The food is always on point, our kids enjoy it and there's always enough for another meal for a next days lunch for a great price. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I simply love this place! Ycs is the best in town in their Cuisine niche. I'm still waiting for a West Valley location but until then I'll be a faithful customer. The customer service is impeccable. Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"My husband and fellow yelper had this place bookmarked for a long time, so we decided to try it tonight. Upon entering, you pay at the register and choose either a small or large bowl. There is only about a dollar difference between the two, so both of us opted for the large bowl. It was about $29 for two large bowls, this includes drinks, and rice. If you have food allergies let them know and they will give you a card to put in your tray, so when you tale your stir-fry to the grill they will clean it before cooking your food. I have a food allergy, and have been to other Mongolian grills where they scrub the grill, and section off a spot to avoid cross contamination, even using seperate cooking utensils. They did not do this here, so it was really at my own risk, fortunately I did not have any kind of a reaction. The buffet offers ample selections of meats, veggies, noodles and sauces to create your stir-fry masterpiece. They only allow you to go up once, so fill your bowl as full as you want, you will be able to take leftovers home. My stir-fry was good. I chose to mix the orange sauce woth the garlic sauce. Overall itvwas a good experience."}
{"text":"I walk in with a ten and walk out full with leftovers for the next two days. That. Is. Awesome. The only time I ever have issues is when I go rogue and try to make my own sauce... always a disaster... but thankfully on the days I'm intelligent I use their guide and it's all good. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because Kristen isn't a huge fan of it, she likes it and all, but I can't give the full monty if we don't both love it. YC's is super legit."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because it is as good as it gets for Mongolian BBQ. This place has lots of great items to choose from to put in your bowl. Great sauce/seasoning items, and a recipe board if you don't feel like winging it. You get steamed white or brown rice, wonton soup, and my favorite, fried crunchy noodles with sweet & sour sauce for dipping. And if you didn't stuff your face enough on noodles, rice, and soup, they have self serve ice cream too. The only thing that sucks is that if you don't finish your food, which you probably won't, they charge you $0.50 for a to-go box. Great leftovers though. You can throw it in a pan and it's almost better than the first time.   My kids love it because they can put whatever they want or don't want in their food, and they eat it all up!"}
{"text":"What's better than smashing down frozen shaved meat and vegetables into a bowl to get every last ingredient packed in there to get the most of your money...? Nothing!  This place is a great lunch or dinner spot, and if you go easy on the wonton chips and frozen yogurt, it's actually quite healthy too.  My favorite part is watching people work their \"techniques\" on how to structurally build the tallest mountain of stir fry, and then somehow cover it in sauce.  I usually get a huge dinner and a full box of left overs for lunch the next day out of one large bowl...but I'm a mere amateur.  Hint: multiply the sauce recipe by at least 1.5 because some of the cooks let half of it run off the hotplate before they start stirring.  I usually just make an extra little dish of it on the side and pour it on after they've cooked my bowl.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Cool idea for a restaurant. You decide what size bowl you want and pay, then go through a buffet of frozen/chilled veggies, meats, noodles, etc. you then add sauce (the chalkboard has different recipes you can try). While they're cooking your bowl, you can decide if you want rice, additional garnishes, soup, etc. A drink is included, too! The staff is nice and accommodating, even during rushes. You get a ton of food if you stuff your bowl full, and can take some home for leftovers.  The food was good, but not crazy amazing. It was similar to other Mongolian BBQ places.  Tips:  -use the parchment paper to squash your food down so you can fit more! -even if the line stretches out the door, don't run away! The line moves fast, and the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here it's always clean the staff is very efficient the food is amazing and just has a feeling that makes you want to hang out and enjoy a family lunch. Thanks for the wonderful food"}
{"text":"Great serving size. Super thin meat and super fresh ingredients. Follow a template or create your own sauce. Really friendly service and all you can eat white rice and wonton chips makes for a great affordable healthy meal"}
{"text":"I've been here once and the lady at the cashier knew that it was my first time, so she was very helpful while I'm choosing the sauce for my noodle. She also explained how does it work and how much food I can get. Because they only give you a bowl, it's one size so you have to put in as much as you need until the bowl is full. She suggested me to press it down and not to be shy to get more so I can be full. I love this place and the lady (I think she is the manager), I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is typical of any YC's Mongolian Grill, but the reason why I'm writing this review is because of the great service at this location.  There is a staff member (server? not sure what to call her) named Janet that is just so helpful. While you're in line making your bowl, she'll ask you if you'd like a sauce prepared, she'll recommend sauces for your taste, etc.  She helps you bring things to your table, and checks in on you during the meal. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Whew it's been a hot minute since I've been to YC's. I was in the area and had some time to kill before meeting a friend for tea so I stopped in. The entrance was a bit backed up with how many people were in line, but it moved quickly and the woman working at the register was quick and efficient at ringing up orders. Then manager was also great about going around and making sure everyone was doing well and ringing up customers too.  I got a small dinner bowl, which also includes a drink, soup, rice, and froyo. I tried to master the art of piling high into my bowl and think I did an okay job. I got Alaskan cod and tofu for my proteins and added veggies, different noodles, and one of their sauce creations from their menu. If I would've read the menu more clearly, I would've added shrimp and an egg (additional costs). Before your food goes on the grill, the cooks scrape it off and add fresh oil. I added raw peanuts on top for a nice crunch. Everything was hot and delicious but unfortunately I was strapped for time so I bought a to-go box for $.50. Leftover YC's isn't as tasty so I recommend eating as much as you can while it's fresh. And I also wouldn't get the red potatoes or cod again, they didn't jive with the rest of the ingredients.   All in all, I'm glad I came back here and it's good to see that they still offer a healthy serving of food for a decent price, unlike another Mongolian grill chain. No hate, but you gotta stay loyal to the OG."}
{"text":"Tried again with the squishing down technique of the frozen meat so when it cooks you get a bit more. Recommended pepper sauce was delish! I recommend that."}
{"text":"Over all a great experience. Quality and quantity is though to beat. We all needs take away boxes. Food was good. If you haven't done this kind of food prep (Mongolian BBQ.) look one up near you. I would come back and will look another in the next town I visit."}
{"text":"The hosts are very nice, and so is the cook. The experience consists of you filling up a bowl with the ingredients: meats, vegetables, spices, etc. Once you've filled the bowl, the cook then prepares your food. I payed for the big bowl ($11.85) and It came with unlimited drinks, rice, soup, chips, and sauce. This is the place to go if you're really hungry. However, if you don't finish your meal and would like to take it home, you have to pay 50 cents for a to-go box- finish all your food and enjoy!:)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was just OK as far as Mongolian grills go. It was fine but I have certainly been to better. This is the first one I have been to where you have to pay more if you want to make up more than one bowl of stir fry. The difference between a single bowl versus unlimited was $2.00 so whats the point of that? Then they have an ice cream machine near the soda dispensers but there is a big sign that says if you want ice cream, go back to the register and pay another dollar. Why not just charge one price for all? Anyway the meat and veggies were good but no seafood available. The sauces were OK but there was only one guy cooking so it took some time to get yours made up even with few people there. The place was not as clean as I would have liked but whatever. It wasn't awful but I'd not make a point to go here again."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had in a long time.  It is clean, food lines are laid out very well with constant re-stocking of fresh food.  You have the option of in or out door dinning."}
{"text":"This the best place ever, I take all my friends here and they all love it. I have to say how sweet that little Jordan is, always smiling and such a nice greeting every time I go when she is working. She is a"}
{"text":"The food here is great! So many sauce combinations to choose from or you can create your own if you're the adventurous type. I always go for the Mongolian with chicken. There's a smorgasbord of veggies and goodies that you can add to your food. The downside is that they charge you for a to go box."}
{"text":"Early Sunday afternoon and the placed was packed. I was thinking, this must be great  Both sides of the selections bar had a waiting line. My wife had been here and with her help, we loaded up a bowl and got in line at the grill. When our turn came, I asked for my noodles to be well done and watched as the \"cook\" took my selections for two trips around the huge round grill. My heaping bowl had turned into half a bowl of steaming great smelling veggies and barley warm noodles. I should have taken it back, but there was still a line waiting for their food to get pushed around the grill so I tried to get past the uncooked noodles and find some veggies.  This  goes on my \"Been There......\" list for sure."}
{"text":"The food was fresh , I made a wonderful concoction of sauce only to have it watered down by the cook to vertully no flavor. I have eaten Mongolia BBQ several times usually they cook the food a little while before pouring the sauce on, hete they put it all on at the samw time so it evaporated away before the food was cooked. So the cook dumped a bunch of water on it washing out the flavor. I tried to add soy to regain the missing flavor which just made it salty.  Then the kicker they charge for to go containers..  hummm"}
{"text":"SO good and great price.  A gym rats dream! I got meat and veggies and I made my own perfect sauce with black pepper, garlic, ginger and then a buy of \"YC's own\" sauce. Perfect small kick and so much flavor but not too rich. Good price - large bowl = 12$ and unlimited for $14. Can't take anything home but wonderful post workout meal. I added brown rice and no noodles and this was just great nutrition and energy and flavor. Wonderful surprise find!!   Also the gentleman at the front register asked if we had been here before and when we said no he walked us through everything and was super friendly. Love it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The hostess was very friendly and explained the process.  The cook however was not at all interested in customer service.  One trip through for $12 plus change.  Way more expensive than similar set up's that offer more.  Nothing was grilled - only steamed.  While the items were fresh, they lacked flavor.  With all the other choices available, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service! My husband and I just relocated from MN and have a similar restaurant in our hometown that we love and YC's completely met our expectations! Great variety of meat, veggies, noodles and sauce. My husband has Celiacs and everything was so clearly labeled he had no trouble making a delicious stir fry! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The prices have just become too high. $50 for 3 people is ridiculous! Plus their ice cream used to be tasty, now it is like eating flavorless foam. Fix the ice cream and lower the prices and I may go again. Until then"}
{"text":"Everything taste so fresh and delicious, the rice noodles are my favorite! Defiantly the cheat meal you want to be having . Coming back forsure!"}
{"text":"The waitress behind the cash register deserves a raise for all of her amazing help and guidance during our visit, she was fantastic. The food was great and so was being able to dine outside and enjoy the weather!"}
{"text":"Yuk. Will never eat here again. It was dis organized and food was undercooked and tasteless.  Honestly - that's really all I have to say about this place ... sadly enough!  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came here with my son (6) for lunch and we both really enjoyed it.  We were greeted a the front podium by a nice lady that took our order and our money in exchange for some bowls to start loading up. Pricing was somewhere around $11 for an adult lunch and my son was $.55 per year of age, plus an additional $1 for shrimp. We loaded up our bowls and sauces and took them to be cooked. My son LOVED choosing the veggies and meat to put in his bowl.   After they cooked, we sat down to eat. My son got a little bowl of beef soup to try out (he loves soup) and then dug into his bowl. He ate a surprising amount of food, but the bowl was huge so he had leftovers, as did I. We paid an extra $1.00 total to get to go boxes for the leftovers. THAT is the reason for the one star being knocked off. Anywhere else you go, if you pay $11 for lunch and have leftovers, they give you boxes to take those leftovers home. The alternative to this is for the food to go into the trash, and that's lame.   Anyway, all in all, we really liked this healthy alternative for a quick meal and will definitely be back. The staff was super friendly and polite the entire time we were there and our interactions felt genuine. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I found a good Mongolian grill!  I used to go to them all the time when I lived in Washington and I was worried I wouldn't be able to since I moved.  I actually went her on accident, I couldn't find the place I had been planning on going to so I went here instead.  That turned out to be a very good idea.  It's only about $10 and you can go through the buffet as much as you like, there's a couple different soups you can get, drinks and an ice cream machine too.  The bowls for the meats and veggies are HUGE!  It was nice being able to fit everything I wanted into the bowl the first time and not having to make multiple trips.  They have a very large variety of sauces and a sort of menu of how many spoonfulls of each different flavor you need to make specific sauces (orange sauce, teriyaki, etc.).  The staff was all friendly and made sure that everyone knew how it worked and gave recommendations for the sauces.  The guys grilling the food were really fast too, not that I would mind if it was slow since it's so much fun watching them cook everything.  The food itself was sooo good!  I don't know if it was the mixture of sauces I used or  the noodles or what but it was better than the other Mongolian restaurants I'd been to before.  I'm definately going to be returning here although next time it will be on purpose!"}
{"text":"Oh! It's been a while, my yummy friend! Thanks for not disappointing. Soooooo much better than any other similar concept. Please come to Tucson soon."}
{"text":"The food was cooked really well and the sauce menu was good. It had ok side dishes (rice, chips) and a wide variety of food to choose from to make your meal. I just wish when you add shrimp to your meal there would be more... I'm fine if I have to pay more it's just that 4 shrimp isn't enough for me."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this original YC's by my boss when our office was on Broadway Rd. Now my wife and I frequent this business. The staff is always super nice with an inviting attitude. The food is spot on and they provide wax paper to mash down food/sauce into your bowl. By now you're probably aware that the key is to get as much food in your bowl as possible. If you're not planning on eating much, get the small bowl--you'll still be filled by the end of the meal. ;)  I definitely recommend dinnertime over lunch. For a couple dollars more you get the Alaskan cod option with the other meats, and ice cream (cone or cup, soft-serve vanilla/chocolate). If you are unable to finish your meal, to-go containers are only 50 cents each, quite a deal in my opinion! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves large portions of healthy food."}

{"text":"Great place that has been recently remodeled! You walk in and pay for a bowl, and then take that bowl through the line of all their ingredients (protein, veggies, noodles, etc) and you create your own dish. Everything tastes great and you really get to be in control of your dish. They have signs up that help you decide on your sauce and then after your food is cooked you can grab all you can eat rice, drink, soup, and soft serve options. They have employees walking around to grab you anything else you might need as well as take dishes off of the table when they're done being used. It is a little pricier ($30ish for two people with the smallest bowl options) but you do get a lot of value as whatever you can fit in the bowl gets put into your dish. Definitely a unique place that's worth a try!"}
{"text":"down grading to a one star due to the fact that I have had a few people email me on here letting me know they too have gotten sick from this place! Eat at your own risk! Don't say I didn't warn you"}
{"text":"We used to love coming here, but today's visit was very disappointing.   Food was GREAT as usual! However,  the \"alternative/rave \" music blaring is not appealing during a meal.  Then seeing gangbanger appearing guys stop at the register then proceed to solicit donations table to table for the Phoenix Restoration Church totally soured us.  I UPDATED MY REVIEW BECAUSE OF THE CARING ATTITUDE OF THE OWNER/MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Yummy with fantastic service. Ryan was of great help during our first visit. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This location is very clean,they staffs customer service is great and they just remodeled! Went the other day and they also added new vegetables to the menu!"}
{"text":"Since I eat at Mongolian BBQ as often as possible where I live in California, I was excited to find a place in a very new area of Arizona. This area is a place that didn't even exist when I was growing up here.   So I have to say since I have been to so many, this is not a new concept for me, and I can compare what I know to be great Mongolian to this.   To educate those that have never been to one, you usually can get as many bowls as you want to use to create the master dish you want to be cooked together. Here, they yelled at us for using more than one bowl and told us to push it down with a piece of paper .... what?!? And meanwhile, those around me where doing it making a huge mess, how could they not? This rule is absurd. Take two bowls and fill them up as you like, then they are cooked together and the cook turns it back to you in one HUGE bowl that is the size of the two small ones that you filled up with even more room.   I am just used to little authentic Mongolian places where there are no rules as to how you create your master dish. And this thing with either all you can eat or one trip for a dollar less is just ridiculous. Just make it one price, all you can eat period. Allowing customers to choose between two choice that have a dollar difference was creating such a negative atmosphere in there with the server going around and telling everyone what they are doing wrong and that they have to get the all you can eat if they use more than one bowl, and if they do all you can eat, they still can only use one bowl. Its just not a good set up for happy customers.   The fun party about Mongolian is being your own master chief, let your customers do that without ridiculous restrictions on bowl usage and smashing down food to make rood for more to pile it up like a tower that is falling down all over the counter."}
{"text":"Great food, clean, nice atmosphere, good variety of food, good customer service , nice to be able to make your own meal"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice switch up from my usual foods. It's a buffet style assembly line and the creations you can make can be great! Many protein, veggie, and carb options to choose from and being able to make your own sauce is a nice addition as well. If you come during lunch you even get free soup, rice, and frozen yogurt so it's quite a good deal for $12! Quality place, I don't see how you could go wrong!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. I am begging the owner please open a west valley location I been calling this out for many years.   Answer my prayer MR YC OWNER.. WE NEED WEST VALLEY GLRNDALE/PEORIA AREA"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good and I have absolutely no complaints about the establishment and the organization. There are a lot of restaurants in Phoenix Arizona metroplex that I enjoy but I can't really say that there is anything that I really miss too much restaurant wise. I enjoy this place very much and I'm really glad that I got to try it but it can never hold a candle to the great(but now closed) hot wok café in Yuma Arizona and it definitely cannot spit shine the boots of Tons Mongolian Grill in Grand Prairie Texas.   If I have to go to the Mongolian Grill in Arizona this would be my top choice but to be honest with you there are not many that I know of. I have to say that Dallas has far better food than most places that I have stayed at. Plus it has a huge variety of so many different kinds of ethnic foods. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Phoenix because I have been to so many places and yet I've forgotten most of them because there were never really too many special qualities about these restaurants except for the few that I have mentioned on yelp.  All in all I have to give credit where credit is due in this place is an exceptional establishment that I have to mention because it is one of the only one going girls that I know of in Arizona and it does a very fine job feeding the people of Phoenix. I'm giving it three stars because to be honest with you even though I enjoy it here I don't miss it and I have only been here twice. I don't believe that you can go up for seconds like other Mongolian restaurant and it was a bit pricier than most Mongolian Grill so I've been to. So I'm giving it a solid three and I'm sticking with that. But you need to go try this place if you ever get the chance because it's a whole new experience if you've never tried to Mongolian Grill."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff was very attentive and the food was delicious!  The veggies were very fresh and the thinly sliced meat, even though it was frozen was delicious once cooked on that awesome grill. I also love that they had green iced tea...actually 4 flavors of iced tea! The decor was better than I expected and very clean.  I went with a relative who's new to the area and got  a coupon for 2 free lunches. We'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I am constantly on the search for keto options and this place hits the spot!  They have kholarabi noodles, coconut aminos, and a few keto friendly sauces too.  This will be a regular for us."}
{"text":"Mongolian BBQ is one of my favorite meals. This was our first time at YC's. It was my daughters first time trying it the lady at the register was super friendly and helped show my daughter how to do it and helped make her a teriyaki sauce for hers and she loved it. Great food and awesome customer service.... we will be back!"}
{"text":"$11.50- Big ass bowl, drink, ice cream, rice, and soup. $12.50- Big ass bowl (unlimited), drink, ice cream, rice, and soup.  Random spouting off prices, I know.  This is all that I kept hearing about the group I was with.  I had no idea what was in store for me.  And then we arrived.  Since I drove, I didn't have to pay (score!).  I was just told to grab a bowl, grab some wax paper, and stuff- HARD!  It just didn't make sense, until I was watching what was happening.  After I saw tons of meats (I think I stuffed the bowl 3/4 with meat), I didn't get too many vegetables, as I just really wanted meat and noodles.  Then next I stacked it with a mix of rice and wheat noodles- I was living dangerously.    Then next up, there is an area that you can make your own sauces (they have like 20-30 to choose from!).  I highly suggest dousing your bowl with liquids, as the pic suggests this stuff is cooked at high heat.  I regret not putting more sauce on mine.  Then when you are complete, you hand to a cook and they heat it up for you.  That is when you get extra rice, soup, and your drink.  The stuff comes out pretty quickly.  Then pick a spot and enjoy.  My beef/pork/noodle combo was pretty good, and was excited of the concoction.  Keep in mind this place is a trial and error type of place, and its up to you to find out what flavors work for you- I think that is unique for a place like this.  You can also get some shrimp, but it costs extra."}
{"text":"OK, I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars. Been coming here for years. Affordable and delicious! Especially love the Spicy Hunan Sauce. Always have had a great experience.  Today, I went to this location with two of my coworkers. One of them has severe peanut and seafood allergies.   The staff was very accomodating at first: They gave her an \"Allergy Warning\" tag and instructed her which sauces to steer clear of (a previous reviewer mentioned that some of YC's sauces have fish stock in them).   Once we got to the grill where your bowl is cooked was where trouble hit. One of the two gentlemen said, in Spanish, \"Just cook it on this used one. And play dumb like you don't understand them!\"   Beyond inappropriate and dangerous!   Unfortunately for these clowns, two out of the three \"snowflakes\" speak Spanish and we called them on it.  They were very cautious after this, but it still left a bad taste in our mouths.   Will I come back? Likely, 'cause . . .  1) I'm a sucka,  2) LOVE stir fry, and  3) It's close to my house.   Bottom line: If you have allergies, WATCH OUT!"}
{"text":"Such a good deal and healthy. I'm on a new crutch with this place. I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"If you know how to pack your bowl its ok. The card reader automatically adds 15% tip so you gotta either figure it out or tip 15%...haha. $30 seemed a bit much for 2 ppl. They charge .50 per take home container"}
{"text":"I love this place. Unfortunately I don't live that close so have to make a special drive there when I get the craving for Mongolian bbq. I feel I'm pretty talented at getting the most food I can into that bowl. I get the white meat chicken, their choices are chicken-white or dark, beef, pork and Alaskan cod. The meat is lightly frozen and curled so when you put in the bowl you have to smash it down. Don't worry they have parchment paper there fire you too do this so your not touching raw meat. Then you choose all your veggies and off you want some seasoning. I always get a ton of bean sprouts, carrots and mushrooms but they have a lot of other veggie choices. Then choose your noodles rice, udon or wheat. I get a mixture of what and udon. I put the noodles on the bowl for the sauce because with all the goodies I load into my food bowl it's just too high otherwise. For my sauce I love to use the teriyaki recipe slightly modified, I leave out the oil and double the garlic and ginger accounts. I'm Italian can't have too much garlic and I love ginger. Then you bring it to the wok where they cook it. It's so freaking good. Then it comes with a drink, rice if you want and soup. I pass on the soup but always get a bowl of brown rice, it's yummy.  Just fyi 50 cents for takeout container which I always purchase cause I get the large bowl and my left others last at least 2 meals. They have soft serve ice cream for a dollar. I highly recommend this place. Wrong tone of the season but during spring training games at the salt river fields it's great to walk to after or before catching the game. I did this twice this year after watching an early DBacks game."}
{"text":"Fresh food, a lot to choose from, incredibly friendly and helpful staff. I would recommend YC's to anyone!"}
{"text":"Today I was greeted by a nice young lady, who took my first time experience to new heights. I was told exactly what to do in a calm manner, and I even had someone come help me make my bowl, because I had no idea what was happening. After choosing my meats and veggies, one worker explained his favorite sauces, and even helped me make the sauce just right. The cook prepared the food with a smile, and it looked very professional. Not the mention, having your food cooked on a huge hot plate is amazing! Thank you so much for my experience today! Will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Meh. I am not a fan of making my own sauce. Apparently, I didn't do it right because it ended up bland. I would like to see more ingredients offered that other places like this have. I didn't know the rice was at the end of the process so I had noodles. I would have chosen rice, had I known. The guy up front was very friendly and gave me two free eggs. I would have thought to be included. Another $1.00 for the yogurt. Again, I might had paid, had I known. Place is clean and comfortable...but at the end of this day, I go out to eat for food and this wasn't that good. I came back to edit for one more detail...no fortune cookies? Really?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and fun! Pack up a gigantic bowl of all-you-can-choose meats/veg/fish and self pick a mix of sauces , finally looking at Mongolians fried them all! YUM!   Very complacent with the amount and variety of food. :))) This is perfect for a tired and hungry traveller."}
{"text":"We love YC's, we have frequented many through our 7 years eating this yum fest,  We had never been to this one, and found it quite by accident one evening, Wow service was above and beyond! We wound up loving it so much we went to our regular location the very next night, I crave this, and my 10 year old does also, I get her a small instead of a kids size so I can eat her left overs ! YUM YUM YUM  always happy tummy's and we have no problem paying for to go boxes,  the new chopped jalepeno's are devine! what a perfect kick!  and the variety of soups from just the one WOW I love this place"}
{"text":"Missed having Asian cuisine after a few days of hotel food. Found this place by the hotel and glad I tried it up. Took it back to my hotel and finished the whole meal. Comforting and hot."}
{"text":"In my opinion, all Mongolian Grill's dehydrated/ freeze-dried protein and veggies are all basically the same. The distinguishing difference that makes or breaks the situation is \"sauce game\". In this occasion, the sauce game is relatively weak and it's clear that the staff knows that because they meet you when you get down to that point in the self-serve line where they jump in and try to assist you however the assistance still yields blandish un-flavorful finished product. A majority of the staff was friendly including Julia and Alicia and the manager guy however my noodle bowl was something that I could probably make at home. The chicken wonton soup was the highlight of the meal. Shame on the dish washer! It was quite an unpleasant interruption to the vibe when I had to go through the dishes to inspect for a clean bowl."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good! I love the selection, and during the weekdays it's not too busy/crowded.   Location is nice, service was good, prices are fair ($12 each). Lots of options to choose from for protein and toppings, plus the sauces are awesome!  YC's is a nice dinner date night spot (nothing to impress a first date with, something to take the husband/wife to), but can get expensive with a large family."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for lunch when I'm working. I get the beef soup and put lots of lemons in it! The people are very nice and they know what I want when I come in now. Always consistently good."}
{"text":"Maria was so kind her customer service is outstanding I love how she assisted me in making the right sauce and even after adding WAY too much spice and regretting it she allowed me to remake my bowl  will definitely be back to this location thank you so much!"}
{"text":"YC's is one of my favorite lunch places! It's very filling, delicious, and I enjoy their selections for your bowl. This location is always clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place... Great price, great food!! I mostly love it because it can be very healthy if you be careful with the sauces..."}
{"text":"The best Mongolian BBQ I have had. They have lots of choices to stuff in your bowl! Make sure you pack your bowl full because it shrinks when they cook it. They even provide papers to use to pack your bowl down and so your hands don't get messy. The sauce station is where the magic happens. They have plenty of recipes to follow or you can make up your own. They have great prices, lots of seating, and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"I try to eat here at least once a week. I've been to several different location and this is by far my favorite. The staff here is friendly and very helpful. If you have a food allergy don't worry because they have you covered! Just ask for an allergy sign and they clean the grill for you. Every time I go in I am treated with respect and I have a great experience. Great food and great people!"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is that it's not in Chicago. Absolutely fell in love with this restaurant when visiting my sis. Great veriaty of sauces and veggies. It's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of AZ, outside of my sister of course."}
{"text":"I came here with me sister Cher, who really likes this place. I'm so used to food being prepared by cooks and brought to me. So, I'm not used to having to prepare my own food via restaurant. I love to cook from recipes, so why should this be any different, right?   As we arrived there wasn't that many people, I was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do. I ended up making a concoction of beef, carrots, broccoli, rice noodles, sprouts with chef's favorite sauce. It turned out good but I know that I was missing something. I tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good.  So, this place is a build-your-own bowl, piled high if necessary, and watch it cook right in front of you.  It was a little overwhelming at first, but if I continue to go there, I will get accustomed to the process."}
{"text":"Come and get food for two days of full belly!!  You go and pick out your meat (chicken, beef, pork and fish). Grab a wax paper and push down your meat because it will shrink so full up, push down and repeat three times.  Then grab your toppings and noodles.  You then come to a sauce bar and you follow the directions to create the flavor that goes into the food.  Take your tray to the cooks and they do their magic and cook it all up.   Good quality food, easy to put together if you read directions.   $12.95 includes one trip bowl, soup, drink and ice cream cone.   Not five stars only because you have to pay .50 for your to go container.   Give me a try."}
{"text":"Well this place isn't cheap cheap, but it's very affordable. The quality of the food is decent, however all of the meat is frozen. Really how good the food tastes is up to you, considering you essentially make it yourself. Definitely go for the unlimited pass for a dollar extra so you can make multiple creations. Yes, they have soft serve too!"}
{"text":"My first YC experience. It's an interesting concept. You get a bowl and stack it with as much food as you can and then it's cooked for you. If you know how to pack your food, it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Allergy friendly! That's my top priority, so I don't become ill. The meats are mediocre, but hardly anything I'm able to eat has any taste so I don't care. I love that they have brown rice also."}
{"text":"I've been eating at YC's for years.  They've had consistently good prices, with a good selection of meats, vegetables, and sauces to choose from.  They also offer 2 different types of noodles, along with white and brown rice to go with your custom stir fry meal.  There are also usually two soups of the day to choose from, made with the previous night's leftovers it looks like.  They also have dessert in the form of soft serve!  For those that don't trust their own sauce-making skills, there are helpful recipes on the board above you for you to choose from.    Their dinner used to be all-you-can-eat at one price, but now they have a single bowl price and an all-you-can eat price.  Generally, I can only eat one bowl, so I usually go for the single trip!  If you can't finish your bowl, take out boxes are $.50 each."}
{"text":"YC's is great in that you control the taste of your food.  The downside of that however, is that if you don't make a good flavorful combination, you're stuck with it (unless you go buffet-style).  At YC's they have a standard price for a bowl of stir-fry, but for an extra dollar you can have it all-you-can-eat.  The price they charge for a bowl includes drink and dessert, which is nice.  Unless you haven't eaten in days, I would recommend sticking to the single bowl since that is more than enough food for one person.   They have a pretty wide selection of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and turkey.  At dinnertime they bring out cod.  I do wish they had shrimp as one of the stir-fry ingredients though, since they have such a limited selection of seafood.  YC's has a good selection for vegetarians too, since they have a wide array of vegetables, and have tofu for those wanting a little more protein in their meal.    For those that prefer rice over noodles, they have white rice and brown rice at the counter where the soda fountain is.  They also have soup at the counter.  Once you've stuffed yourself silly with your own tasty concoction of stir-fry, you can head over to the ice cream machine for some soft-serve.  If you can't finish your meal, they do have take-out boxes, but they charge a small fee for them (a dollar I think)."}
{"text":"This YC's, compared to the other ones in Tempe, has a better selection of diet soda drinks at the soda fountain (Sprite Zero Diet Coke, and Caffeine Free Diet Coke), and service is very friendly and speedy.  I believe the meat selections are the same (white and dark meat chicken, pork, beef, fish in the evening), but I like the selection of veggies here, which includes water chestnut and baby corn.  The addition of various blended spices to your bowl, in addition to the plethora of sauces to choose from, adds to the experience.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is great if you know what you're doing. I've been here many times and it took multiple times for me to figure out what flavors taste good and ones that aren't as good. Luckily they have a sign for your novices to follow on how to make your food. The staff is friendly and willing to help you if you need it. The portion is huge if you know how to pack your bowl down. Jump on that bad boy like a suitcase you are trying to pack tight. Don't be shy. For the amount of food you get plus a drink the price is fair. They normally charge 50¢ for a to go box but they've never charged me before. Depends on if they like you I guess. Just be friendly."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me a couple of months ago that this was one of the restaurants she liked to visit. I had never been, so I gave it a shot tonight. Some pros and cons. Con: the traffic flow sucks. It takes a little longer to place the order, especially if a family or first timer is in front of you. It only takes a couple of people to put the line out the door. In fact one family of 5 was in line and I was next, standing with the door open. For that family, it was $41, which I thought was a little high for what you would get. Pro: there were many options of meats, vegetables and sauces. So much so that staff members were in place to ask about my sauce preference and they made it for me. Con: I didn't like meat packing. That was kind of nasty, really. The meat is frozen and arrives in the oddest shapes. Put that down as a base and add vegetables on top. The bowl fills up quickly, so you take the tissue, place on top of the ingredients and pack down. Like I said, a little nasty. Pro: The food was actually pretty good - they stir fry everything for you and it reminded me of Jade Palace in Atlanta - back when it was good. Con: I saw everyone packing the ingredients down and coming away with huge, heaping bowls, so I followed suit - then I felt like a lard ass when my bowl produced a large and a small bowl of finished product. What am I going to do with two bowls of food? I ate the small one and took the large one home. Typically a to-go box is 50 cents, but tonight they were having a high school fund raiser, so the fee was waived. Thanks, kids! Another pro: for the second time in a week a waiter referred to me as \"boss\" when calling me. Third time and its a trend, right?   The small bowl, one visit is $9, the large bowl just a dollar more - and an unlimited return trip bowl was $11. I am not sure anyone would make a repeat trip. Like I said, my one large bowl turned into two bowls at the end. Too much for a guy even as big as me to eat.   Overall, despite the nasty meat packing and poor traffic flow, I was pleased with the experience. It made for a good meal and a box of left overs that most likely will get thrown out (but you have to bring it home because you think you will eat it, right?) and you can follow it up with a nice soft-serve ice cream sundae. I took the chocolate/vanilla swirl. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Our family favorite!! My kids beg to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's always fun to make your own food. The staff Is pretty helpful too if you don't know what you're doing. The portions are pretty generous as well.   My only complaint is that they make you buy a to go box for 50 cents. Seems like they could just give those out? Otherwise I love this a"}
{"text":"I haven't been here recently,  but for several years I ate lunch twice a week at various YC's locations. It wasn't anything YC's did,  I was just moved to an office that wasn't convenient to go to a YC's at lunchtime.    I have spoken with the owner several times as he would walk through the dining area thanking customers for their business.  The restaurants are always clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Now that I think about it,  it's about time for another visit."}
{"text":"I had a negative experience with this place first time I went. I yelped about it and the owner was nice and professional enough to respond to my Yelp! He sent me a free lunch/dinner voucher for two people. I went again and had a positive experience. The quantity of food for the price is amazing (will last at least 2-3 meals). Pretty good stir fry as well! More than anything, I was amazed with how understanding the owner was and would recommend this place for service!"}
{"text":"Always packed when we come here for lunch/dinner. Overall the process is fast considering the amount of people in line and food is great!"}
{"text":"I know why they don't have one of these in California. F'reals... if they opened this up, UCSD asian-ness would be all over it in a crazy eating frenzy.   Came here with UCSD dragon boat team before a race day and heck, we were ready to stuff our faces! This place makes Khan's Mongolian Grill in UTC look like trash.  Instead of yelling at you for piling on too many meat (or veggies if that's your thang), this place ENCOURAGES it! Yeah! Plus, you can opt for one massive bowl or if you're a crazy big eater, you can opt for unlimited bowls. YC must stand for \"You Crazzzzzzzy\" if you eat that much. Only downside here is that all the sauces kind of taste the same after a while.  If that's not enough for your stomach to explode, there's endless soup, chips, rice, drinks, and frozen yogurt for you to gorge on.   They take all your needs into account... including a plunger in each stall of the bathroom. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I very rarely give out 5 stars so here is why I do for this place... First off the people are friendly and that is really great...  Also, the ingredients are always fresh, the cook staff are fast, and everything is delicious.  If you are a newbie, follow a recipe... If you are adventurous, try lots of YC's own, black bean, Garlic, Szechwan, and a little sesame oil.   I started out on Kublai's Mongolian BBQ in Hong Kong. If I had one thing to change or add to YC's it would be to include an egg as an ingredient, white rice as an ingredient, and fried tofu as well.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to rate this place because a good part of the responsibility for the quality of your dish is your own.  That said, I've been to other Mongolian BBQ's and have come to realize that the restaurant's part of the responsibility is a key factor!!!  I've given this YC's many chances:  followed more than one displayed recipe, experimented with my own concoctions.  Regardless, the result of every visit is mediocre at best.  My guess is perhaps the quality of veggies (even though they look fresh, doesn't mean they taste good) the ingredients of the sauces, or the cooking method, not to mention the noodles/rice, and ambiance, is the cause for my disappointment.  I recommend Genghis Grill @ the Tempe Marketplace for a much better experience! :D"}
{"text":"At first, I was taken back by the $12+ price tag for a bowl of food at a fast casual place. But then, I started peeling back the layers and really found this place to be super family friendly and full of extras.  For the cost of a large bowl, you also get a bowl of rice, bowl of soup, a drink and a frozen yogurt. To say I could've gotten a smaller bowl was a large understatement, but DO NOT get a small bowl. I repeat, do not get a small bowl. For just a single dollar more (and $.50 for the cost of a to-go box... so $1.50), you have a full lunch for the next day! And okay, if you have a smaller appetite, the smaller bowl would give you that as well.   The best part though and something I've not seen at any other restaurant EVER is how they price their kid meals. They base the cost based on age. My kids eat just about nothing, so taking them here and having to pay $5/each would have been a deal breaker. BUT, instead they charge $.55 per year of age, making my 3yo's meal (with the rice, drink, soup and frozen yogurt too!) is only $1.65. My 5yo's meal is only $2.75. Now we're talking.  I wish they had some sort of reward's club or something, but regardless, I'm excited about finding this place. The people were nice and helpful when it came to choosing sauces and the sauces were labeled with vegetarian and gluten free labeling (which is great because I am definitely the V).   We will be back, especially on my birthday when I get a free meal for signing up for emails!"}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly back in the '90s when I was at ASU.  I was in the Staples across the way and the cashier assured me this YC's was still good.  YC's is still a good choice for Mongolian BBQ, although it is not one the fanciest Mongolian place I have been to.  It is clean, has plenty of seating, the service is quite good, and the price is right.  I like that the meat is at the beginning of the line and the noodles at the end of the line.  (Anyone who is familiar with Mongolian BBQ will understand the architectural importance of putting the meat in the bowl first instead of trying to pile it on at the end.)    $8 for a small bowl and $9 for a big bowl.  The price includes soup and a drink, but not ice cream which is an extra $1."}
{"text":"Best choice for fresh food and great service. Was my first time and was walked thru the easy process to make my meal just the way I liked it. Will be back with friends next week."}
{"text":"Went here with a co worker after a difficult day. This place is great. Tons of food, for a decent price! Plus it's the way YOU want to make/prepare it. It can make almost anyone happy with the selection.  The staff was very helpful with making the dressing/sauces.  Make sure to grab a to go container as the 'next day you' will be very happy too.  Bathrooms are also very clean, which is nice."}
{"text":"First time going intonight, the girls upfront were soo nice and they were working the whole time, helping customers, cleaning, and keeping up with the lines! Everything was great, the food was awesome! I got full within a few bites of my bowl, cant belive how much food you get! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Such a cool concept. When my best friend came to visit from the east coast I had to take her. I love that you can come and still be really healthy too."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today for lunch. I have to admit, I was a Mongolian Grill virgin.  I walked in debating if I was even going to stay, but the cute little cashier convinced me to try it.  For just over $10 for a small bowl, I was ready to have my over-stuffed self rolled out of there.  I would like to say that the staff was pleasant like in other reviews, but I really had no interaction with them outside the cashier.  It was the customers ahead of me that taught me what to do (yeah, I'm a solo eater!).  It felt like a bit of camaraderie going on with patrons.  How cool is that?!  I am convinced that my kids would love this place, I just think they would not enjoy the food, make it themselves or not.  I will most definitely be back for lunch another day!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went here last evening with my wife to have some time to ourselves. I have only heard about this place from those that have been and how good the food is, so it was worth the trip. You go in and pay and then you get a bowl to add everything in that you want to be cooked up on a very large heated surface. Meat includes, chicken, beef and fish and tons of veggies. The key to filling up your bowl is to keep pressing everything down into your bowl so you can get as much food as possible. Once you have everything compressed, you top it off with as much noodles as you can (three types) and add the sauce that you like to try. There is a board up on the wall that shows you how to mix the sauces to get what you want. The food is cooked and placed into a bowl for you. Also included in the price is rice, soup, frozen yogurt and drinks. All for just around $10.00.  The food is fresh, and no added fillers. Worth coming to. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Mongolian grill before so not sure if this is good or bad for Mongolian but I thought it was amazing.   You walk in with a bowl to a buffet type spread. You pick your freeze dried meats, veggies, noodles, rice. (The key is to pack them in the bowl as tight as your can so you get tons. Then you make your own sauce from a combo of sauces. You give it to the cook and they grill it up. RESULTS: Flavor glory!"}
{"text":"Too bad I can't select less than 1 star. Where do I start, first of all there is an \"Up-charge\" for things like eggs and shrimp. So I guess you better know how many eggs you want before you pay for your all you can eat bowl. Second there is no way to taste test any of the sauces, the girl actually told me I could put some in a small bowl, taste it with my fingers and then she would give me a wipe to clean my hand so I can taste the next one. Third, why in the world would you put your noodles on the line instead of behind the grill, just to fill the bowl up quicker? For some reason the sodas are included, which is no bonus for someone that drinks water. Wonder why the bottom of your bowl looks like soup, watch the guy cooking the food throw water on it and cook for like 30 seconds.  The selection is small, the quality is low, the service is poor. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"First time going to YC's and the young lady at the front was so helpful. She explained the whole process to us and what she felt was the best deal. The only thing I wish YC's had more of was a variety of meats and other different sauces. Other than that I had no complaints. The store was very clean, staff was lovely, the food was amazing, and the experience was wonderful."}
{"text":"Take tips from a former employee, from when dinner was $9 and the bowls were ceramic.  SPRING for the large bowl, when you pick up your bowl conveniently take two, it is for sauce later, you will need it. Depending on the time of day employees might enforce their one bowl rule even after you inform them it is for sauce because they have small bowls above the sauce later down the line. Those bowls are small, they are for rookies, you want a large bowl for sauce.  TO GO. Tell them your order is to go, there is no reason to pay $0.50 per box to eat there, the ambience at home with your dog is better. When they asked \"do you want a soup cup?\", you bet your sweet buns you want a soup cup. Even if you hate soup you want a soup cup. You have taken naps all week for dinner to be able to afford this $14 treat.  PROFILE both lanes before committing. The elderly and the young will slow you down, avoid lanes with these people. If only one lane is open ask an employee to open the other lane, it is probably closed for restocking but they can restock around you, but be empathetic and keep your trip clean because they have probably just cleaned it.  MEAT is at the beginning and you will need to grab tissue to smash it down. Meat is the enemy!! Or at least it can be. The meat is curled on purpose. It is at the beginning so that it takes up more space in your bowl - that is why it is curved. Be smarter than the dead meat. Find lots of small pieces that are flat or find curled pieces that look less frozen than others so they are easier to smash.  FLAT veggies go on first. They go around the edges, flush with the sides of your bowl leaving the middle for baby corn or potatoes and the like i.e. non-flat stuff.  BROCCOLI was public enemy number two in this race to stuff your face, but now it's your bff. Pick pieces of broccoli with long stems and put them on your tray until you have put ALL other veggies in your bowl. Only then will you place each individual piece of broccoli around the edge of your bowl like a tasty Christmas wreath. Push the stem down into the other veggies and use the head of each broccoli piece to increase the size of your bowl!! Holy Batman, Batman, that's friggin genius!  NOODLES now that your broccoli wreath has stabilized the mass of veggies in your bowl and increased stackable surface area, you are ready for noodles. TWIRL those noodles like it's mom's spaghetti and your palms aren't sweaty. The more your noodles look like a suburban bird's nest, the better. STACK EM HIGH, if you do it right you can balance three or more bird's nests in top of your bowl and by this time your mass should be touching the sneeze guard!  TRIPLE SAUCE. You are a pro, you have trained for this, you spent all that time looking at the YC's menu of sauce combinations online and you have memorized what you want, now triple it. Break out that hidden second large bowl and scoop yo sauce. If you got bowl blocked in the beginning you will need two small bowls and to develop a better slide of hand for next time. Don't bother trying to put sauce in your skyscraper bowl, you will spill, employees will glare at you, just use the extra bowl (s).  RESTACK. If there is a line at the grill, transfer your tray over to the waiting area and attempt to stack any stragglers back on top of your bowl but, just like two a.m. at the club, DO NOT SMASH it!  ASK if the grill person can scrape the grill (it helps to flash some cash at this point to let the grill person know you mean business, tip em if you got em) you spent a lot of time curating your flavor, don't let your predecessors' bowls muck it up!  REMEMBER to mention that it is to go. They will hand you: a small box, a cup, a utensil, a bag. Get them all. Don't get shorted.  SIDES. While you are waiting, fill your box with rice half way and crispy wontons totally smashed half way (still crunchy and delicious, just more food per inch cubed if they are smashed a little, or a lot, w/e). If your gigantic spaceship of food is still being grilled, grab some soup. DRAIN the broth. Broth is for the sick and the rich, you came here for value and to live on left overs for a week. AFTER the soup cup if full of chicken and veggies you can add some broth to keep it warm on the drive home.  COLLECT your food from the grill master. If you have not allotted at least two large boxes and a small box you need more practice.  NO ICE. Ice is for penguins and polar bears, you need soda and have no room for space fillers like frozen water.   MOVE out of the way of others trying to get stuff and things from the small area to do so. Close the tops of your boxes and put them in your plastic bag at a table near the back - far away from the line and the rush. Don't be a menace, while standing there drinking your juice.  Good luck to you on your journey to massive gains, may the odds be ever in your favor."}
{"text":"Oooh I love this place.  I used to frequent the Tempe location on Southern and McClintock, but yesterday was my first time at this particular location.  It's extremely nice and spacious, definitely a lot newer than my previous haunt but they seemed a little understaffed last night.  Maybe it was because it was a Thursday night, but there was only one girl running the register, showing the newbies how the place worked, and cleaning the dining area, while the other girl was cleaning up.  Needless to say, most customers who came in had to wait a while before being rung up.  Now on to the good stuff, the food.  How it works:  You walk in, pay for your meal - about $13 for dinner, grab a tray and a bowl, and fill it up!  It's like a buffet of raw food.  First are the meats which are frozen and thinly sliced, but you're provided with little paper sheets to help you push down the food in your bowl and stuff as much as you want in the bowl.  Then the veggies will take up pretty much all the space left in your bowl (if any), and finally your choice of three different types of noodles.  Honestly, I think loading up your bowl is an art.  Especially when you get to the noodles and you're faced with this balancing act of piling noodles on your tray, I mean bowl.  You also get to mix up your own fantastical, magical concoction of sauces (I might be having too much fun here) which you will then bring to the chef with your bowl/tray of raw ingredients and they'll fry it up all up right in front of you!  After you get your bowl back, now transformed and cooked to deliciousness, head over and get yourself some rice, soups, chips, drinks, and later (it's hard to resist) ice cream!  I know what you're thinking, how in the world am I going to stuff this into my tummy?  Doggy bags.  $0.50 per box, but so worth it cause you will have food for days.  Okay, like another meal or so.  So if you're a college student who loves food but is short on cash or just love a good deal, YC's is gonna be your new best friend."}
{"text":"Great $12 lunch to go! If you press it really tight, you can get 2 portions lunch :)"}
{"text":"10 bucks for a large bowl including rice and a drink. Yes please! Pick your meat (dark and light chicken, pork, beef, cod), load up on veggies and then move to your starch. I loved that they had recipes for sauces for those that couldn't decide. My bowl was delicious, I went with the chefs special sauce and kicked it up with siracha. The soup was a beef broth and I heavily piled on the wontons. I couldn't finish my bowl but my leftovers were great.   The only reason this isn't 5 stars is they charge for take home containers and the hostess had an attitude. And if you don't have cash you are putting that 50 cents on your debit card... Not cool really. Still I would definitely be back as the food was good and the line moved quickly."}
{"text":"I always leave YC's feeling full and wonderful. I love how they encourage you to stuff your bowl full of food by supplying tissues to pack it down. The staff is so friendly and always offer to make your sauces. I suggest getting the large bowl them getting a to-go container. They also have soup you can fill up on so the to-go container is totally worth it. Now I don't need to eat for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"You fill your bowl with meats,veggies, noodles & sauce.... Then they'll cook it all up for you!  Plus for the same price you can help yourself to white or brown rice, 2 kinds of soup, beverages & top it off with frozen yogurt!  I think the large dinner bowl was under $12!  The lady at the front  was very helpful, as she knew we had never been there before....she told us what to do then helped us with the sauce (each has its own recipe)"}
{"text":"First time to YC's (first time to ANY Mongolian BBQ). FOOD WAS EXCELLENT, fresh.  LOTS of choices on meats and veggies.  Great, friendly staff too!  I'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst tasting food places I have ever had. I am use to BD's so I knew the routine already and since I was new to this particular Mongolian place, I decided to go with the sauce called \"Chef's special.\" I loaded my bowl up with steak and chicken with a lot of veggies. Picked a few seasonings I use at home and at other places. The sauce bowl was huge which made me think they weren't flavorful if you needed 12 ladles in order to make the good good. The meat was very tough, the taste of the completed dish tasted old, freezer burned, bland, and generic. I was I pleased with the food, but the service was decent considering they don't spend much time interacting with their customers. Waste of money.   ***edited a few hours later A business owner saw this review and was very professional, I will give it another chance bc of the great customer service after my experience, that's how successful business's operate."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. So above average. This place is good for what it is. Go in, pay for a small, medium or large bowl, get your food in the bowl and some sauces in a separate bowl at the end, give it to the cook and then enjoy. Oh, and at a separate bar, get some white or brown rice, soup or some sauces. Then get yourself a drink. That's it. One small thing I don't like is that every single thing is frozen. The food lost its quality that it should have. But for a quick lunch at a place like this, what can I expect? Oh and for a small, the price here was $10.25. I think that's a little expensive all things considering."}
{"text":"This place is affordable and delicious. Also they help you figure out the sauce to add to your dish. If you get the lunch special a small is plenty, trust me. You get rice and also a drink and soup with the lunch special too! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great price for what you can get! Food is always delicious and they get you in and out quick. Sometimes the brown rice isn't cooked all the way, but other than that I love the place!"}
{"text":"Gross. Filthy. In dire need of remodel. All utensils, dining surfaces, fixtures, trays, etc are in need of replacement.  The ignorant, un-enthused staff member did not fully explain the choices available as she handed us dingy steel bowls, and charged about $12.00 a person for them. . I also was WAY NOT COOL with what seemed like gallons of water being added to my meal as it was cooked on the grill, ultimately creating a disgusting soupy mess of a dinner.  I was not interested in finishing my meal, and HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR A TO-GO CONTAINER AND A BAG.  Finally, when it comes to the soup... Do not, for your life, eat this trash. It's days old meats and veggie bits... So rancid. So gross. If you look at my other reviews, I tend to focus on the positive aspects of my dining experiences, but unfortunately the negatives at YC's Mongolian Grill were many.  I highly suggest NOT eating here."}
{"text":"Bowls are a little pricey and if you have a smaller appetite therea really no alternative but if you are hungry or plan on taking left overs home, food is amazing! There is a ton of variety for your liking, then it's cooked right in front of you!"}
{"text":"It cost $13 per person ($12.50meal $.50 To-Go Box) Great bang for buck! You get a bowl and literally stuff it until you have a big mountain. You then put your sauce in a separate bowl (use the recipes they have listed!) Then give it to the guy to cook it for you (takes about 5min) I'd strongly suggest to either use 2 sauce recipes, or double the recipe you have Once you get you're bowl back you will notice your food shrunk in half It will still be way more than you can probably eat Just in case it's not enough food, your order comes with unlimited rice, soup, chips, soft drink, and cheap yogurt you want! :)  Tips: Use the wax paper to squish all the food possible into your bowl!!! Look at the people around you if you feel at all lost (really helped me) They only charge $.50 for a To-Go Box because people could easily fill a box with some of the unlimited rice or chips if they wanted to. (please don't do it though)  Everyone here was extremely friendly. Even the cooks said hello to me! This is an excellent spot if you want to show somebody you know of a small unique restaurant (like on a date with an outgoing girl, or a guy that enjoys eating a ton)!!! Me and my girlfriend would love to come once a month but it's a little too far for us.  Don't come if: You hate buffet style restaurants It's a Saturday night and you hate awesome car shows (parking lot) You're a picky eater that doesn't like getting their food squished together You only plan on eating a little"}
{"text":"YC's? Because!  When I first moved to the Phoenix area, I discovered the most beautiful Mexican-American woman in the world...working at YC's Mongolian Stir Fry. In fact, having sampled several locations in the valley, the owner seems to be fond of hiring the most beautiful Mexican-American women. I don't really care but it is distracting when I eat there twice a day.  If you've never tried Mongolian Stir Fry, basically you put raw ingredients into a bowl, add sauces and it is cooked on a big, hot surface. After a couple of minutes, BING! Lunch and dinner and another lunch, if you know how to \"play\" the system at YC's.  There are no \"going back for seconds,\" so plan accordingly. You get your bowl and pay $10 (children are charged by age or just get them a small bowl).  Your first step is loading in the meat. Huh-huh! The meats are sliced and frozen. Place a good amount in the bowl and press it down with the papers at the end of the bar. I like to then go to the fry station and load some peanuts in the bowl and put on some hot chili oil. Then I load on assorted vegetables, tofu and noodles. Then I add the sauces. Some locations have \"sauce experts\" who take a brutal ribbing for having that on the back of their shirts. Imagine a beautiful Mexican-American woman with that on her shirt. It gives you ideas. Impure ideas.  Honestly, the line method is meat, veggies, sauce, then step up to the fry station, add sesame seeds, peanuts, pineapple and/or assorted oils and such and the chef will cook it for you. I do it by jumping around (when there's no line of people behind me) so the sauce sits on the meat (huh-huh!) and isn't all sitting on the noodles. Don't worry about overloading the bowl a mile high of your food choices. It cooks down and the idea is taking stuff home. They actually encourage it (take out boxes are 50¢, so it's a profit scam...deal).  Add a bowl of all-you-can-eat-and-stuff-into-the-baggies-in-your-pocket rice (white or brown) and soups (always two kinds) and you are in heaven...with beautiful Mexican-American sauce experts! Huh-huh!  Please don't forget to tip the cook a dollar per bowl and leave a couple of bucks for the girls who have to clean up the table...scrubbing and bending. Cleaning up after such a dirty, dirty boy. Mmmmmm-ah!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch or dinner. Only gripe is that I wish they had more seafood options (choices of fish or shrimp that you didn't have to pay extra for) but obviously I get that since seafood is expensive. Cool local place to get food for a date or a night out with friends and since you're the one choosing what's in your bowl, the end product is really up to you."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to go to in order to eat large amounts of meat. I use my whole body weight to smash down the meat into the bowl and then flip he meat sideways to make a wall to hold even more meat before adding vegetables and noodles on top. The selection of spices and marinades is quite impressive. I suggest not only getting two containers of flavor but to add it into the dish itself to give all he flavor you need to combat he heavy amount of meat. Muahahaha!  Another thing of note is that the bowls of food also come with drinks, soup, and rice on the side. During dinner hours it may come with unlimited ice-cream. After you finish eating you can pay for a to-go container for $0.50 to take the excess amounts of food home for another meal or two."}
{"text":"Visited this spot tonight with my love after visiting Genghi's Grill a week ago. I was told that this place was better but I was heavily disappointed. There wasn't a good selection of meats or seafood. The sauces were all watered down so I barely had any taste to my food. The cook dumped a raw egg into my noodles (which cost an extra quarter, unlike Genghi's ) and cooked it for all of 30 seconds then thew my food with the raw egg still in it, in the bowl. To top it off, we watched another patron have to pay to get a to-go bag! I won't be revisiting this place again."}
{"text":"YC's is great food.  You get to fill up your bowl with all the ingredients you like and watch it be cooked right in front of you.  The ingredients are always fresh and there is a wide variety of sauces.  Good meal for vegans, plus the soft-serve is vegetarian too!"}
{"text":"I hate giving this place such a poor review, but over all, I wasn't all that impressed.  I came here last night for dinner for the first time, and I can't say that I'm really interested in going back any time soon.  I was hungry, and wanted something different then the usual. I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.  I built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.  The staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?  I guess Im just not overall impressed, and had better experiences with Mongolian style cooking.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  :-("}
{"text":"This is one of our family favorites when in the mood for a huge flavorful and inexpensive meal.  The food selection is substantial and the quantities are limited only by your skill in filling your bowl.  Suggestion: you can use one bowl for food and another for your sauce if you like - no additional charge.  Start off with meat: chicken (both white and dark are offered), pork, beef and fish.  Pile on the veggies: (little corn on a cob, lettuce, carrots, onions, sprouts and more I can't remember), add noodles (three kinds are offered, I like the wheat) and then create your personal sauce or select from a dozen or so suggested varieties on a big billboard.    A large selection of sodas and several kinds of tea are available at a fountain and rice, soup and chips top off the buffet.  Your selection will be cooked in front of your eyes on a huge hot stove and warning - it stays hot for quite some time so use caution when forking it into your mouth.  What would normally be called wait staff in any other restaurant are very efficient and will assist in food selection or fixing any issue you might have.  They have always been pleasant and helpful when we have dined there.   Two suggestions: buy some take out cartons (50 cents each) when you enter because you will need them.  Even after cooking the food quantity is large and few diners exit without their \"Fido bag).  Secondly, leave room for yogurt.  Not just yogurt, Nanci's Yogurt.  The best there is IMHO.  They feature vanilla (my fav), chocolate (wife's fav) and mixed in both old fashioned cones or cups as you prefer.  Note: yogurt is included in the dinner price but is slightly extra at lunch.  They also have senior pricing for us seasoned veterans.  Provided everyone in your large group likes Asian buffets this is the ideal place to eat.  Everyone gets their favorite food and the price is right.  Plus, there is almost always enough to take home so you get at least two meals for the price of one.  The dining room is very large but not very noisy so good place for both adults and kids."}
{"text":"I love coming here. I was craving Asian food but most places were closed so we decided to come here. As usual I want disappointed. It's a nice change from, well pretty much everything!"}
{"text":"it's a good idea, I can see where people are inundated with too many choices, I know I was, and it felt rushed, and cramped the night I was there.  The food is good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, very hard to find good vegan food out in Chandler but a really awesome girl named Alyssa helped me through everything and made me a fantastic meal here. So come one, come all, for vegan vegetarian pescatarian or meatatarian ask for Alyssa and make sure to tip! Thanks for an awesome dinner guys!!!"}
{"text":"YC's Mongolian Grill might be a chain, but it's still great for an epic carb-packed meal! I come here every so often when I'm feeling the urge to indulge in my craving for noodles and this place doesn't disappoint! For \"all you can eat\" it also includes the soup which is not bad at all, rice, wonton chips, unlimited drink, and ice cream!   There's lots of options to choose from when it comes to meats and veggies to add to your noodle bowl and if you do all you can eat, you don't have to feel pressured into stuffing everything all in one bowl! There's also lots of sauces to choose from and they add some helpful tips for certain types of sauces.   Overall I think this place is great for noodles! Is it authentic asian? No it's not, but everyone knows that! Is it the best noodles I've had? No it's not, but it's a great deal!  Tips: Don't feel pressured into finishing your bowl of noodles - asking for a to-go box is $0.50.  I actually LIKE taking some home because it's always so piping hot when you get your noodles! Once you let the noodles cool off and absorb all the sauce it's super good when you heat it back up in the microwave!"}
{"text":"I'm not too familiar with mongolian food, but I do know that YC's is the only place where I've had that type of food. I've been there quite a few times, but I haven't really paid much attention to all the specific details while eating there. It can be really surprising what you realize when you pay attention to all of your surroundings when going out to eat. The price for a large bowl is 10.50, a small bowl is 9.50, for unlimited servings it costs 12.50, and for kids 12 and under the price is .55 times their age. The prices do rise for dinner but only by a few dollars (after 5pm), I think it's still completely worth the price because you get so much to eat while paying the exact amount given.  There is no need at all to worry about not getting enough to eat. Giving my experience a total score of of a possible five, it would either be a five or fairly close. I honestly enjoyed every bit of the food and the overall experience. The only downfall that comes to mind is the fact that there was so much food I served myself and I couldn't finish everything. You definitely need to know how much you want so you are able to serve yourself the correct portion size, not that this is always a bad thing though. There is no worry that I wouldn't have enough to eat. Also what really made the experience enjoyable was how good the food tasted. It seems really simple to make, and it is, so it's very unexpected when you go through so many choices and each time discover how wonderful it tastes. The bowl size that you purchase includes possible choices of being filled with whatever you choose. The meat choices were beef, pork, or light/dark chicken. You then choose any vegetables you'd like to add in, which included a variety of choices from peppers, mushrooms, to broccoli and more. You then choose which type of the three noodles you'd like and then top it off with as much of any sauce you'd like. If you think it's done and ready to cook then, you're wrong. Ater your bowl is completely finished you also have more choices of things to add as you approach the chefs. This includes different seasonings and spices to top it off with along with seeds or jalapenos, and even more! After I chose all my favorite things, I watched as the cook grilled my food in a very unique way right in front of me.  It was really interesting considering most places cook your food in the back. I'm not sure what this was called, but they take all the raw ingredients you choose and put them onto a big round, scorching hot grill. They will stir your personally chosen ingredients around evenly until they're cooked at the perfect temperature. This experience lets you quickly see everything you put in your bowl become a delicious masterpiece. The wait was less than five minutes from the time I walked in to when I got my food, of course this depends on how busy they are. Unlimited drinks are included along with a side of two choices of soup, two different kinds of rice, and chips (all included in any bowl size you purchased).  The feel was perfect, it was very clean and the music/ lighting inside was just right. Being able to sit anywhere was nice because everything was spread out and not crowded whatsoever. The smells of the delicious food being grilled pleasantly filled the entire restaurant. The server greeting my sister and I at the door was very polite. Comforting questions were asked, such as \"have you been here before\", \"how is everything tasting\", and making sure there wasn't anything else we needed. Our server wasn't annoying about it, but it was very polite when he asked and how he asked it. Overall the food tasted really good. You choose yourself exactly what you want to get, so there seems to be little to no chance of disappointment. If you were unsure how to make something you know you'd like, there was a menu with about sixteen different combinations telling you exactly how to make something you might enjoy.   I think the strengths were obvious when going to YC's. All the criteria that I had expected turned out to be better. The environment wasn't how I expected it to be, but that wasn't a bad thing. It was still calm and enjoyable, which is essentially what most people look for when eating out. Like I said before, the food tastes absolutely amazing. It's very different, but it's also definitely satisfying. Overall, it was very enjoyable, and the environment had a lot to do with that. I honestly only have positive things to say about this YC location off of Power road. The service was more polite than expected and I guarantee I'll be back with an attitude looking forward to an experience as great as the last, along with the great food. With the reasonable price for so much of the amazingly delicious mongolian grilled food, I'm positive I'll be back in the near future for more."}
{"text":"The girls are amazing. Great customer service. They are so nice and helpful! On my first time there, they explained how everything works. Cuz I felt really lost! Tasty food!"}
{"text":"My family really enjoyed this place and have now gone twice. My daughter has a blast watching the cooks and loves the noodles. My husband and I can make exactly what we want and the little extras like the wontons and soup are just as yummy. We are already planning a trip here soon."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! You go in and select your meat, add your veggies and sauce, and they cook it right in front of you! Smash down the meat, then pile your bowl as high as you can! So fun!"}
{"text":"In general I like Mongolian Grill concept restaurants and YC's is no different. First visit was kind of underwhelming but this location has a good vibe, helpful notes and sauce combinations written on a chalkboard and a speedy service which  is hard to beat. However, it fails to excel in any distinguishable way which leaves it firmly in the good but not great category. Everything others have posted in their five star reviews is true, your mileage will depend on how much you value portion size, unlimited drinks, etc. Definitely a solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch, seriously haven't been here in forever, same great taste as always. The line was stocked with fresh ingredients, the line was clean and there was a young lady she is always there she must be a manager, she is helpful and will you with your selection if you need it and talk you through the process! I consider myself a pro lol but it was nice to have her help my not so pro friends. Food came out perfectly cooked and dining room was clean. Five min into our meal another young lady checked on us to make sure everything was perfect. It was Delish ! My only one negative would be it was like it's going through a remodel or something there was holes patches every where and stuff moved around! With that being said none of that effected the food or the service ! I'll be back for sure !!!!"}
{"text":"Good Mongolian BBQ place albeit on the pricey side at dinner. Lots of add in options as well as sauces to choose from.  Soup and rice could use a little work as well as the desserts. The place is kept clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I've been going to various YC Grill's around the valley for years, but about 4 months ago they blew me out of the water with an idea for a sauce. I walked into the Tempe (Elliott) location after a workout at nearby Jab Fitness.  I wanted to eat healthfully, but the sauces can be so filled with sodium and sugar, I didn't know the best way to go.    I was resigned to just have sugar and salt, when I was asked if I needed help with my sauce.  So, I asked which sauce would best fit my needs.  Once we discovered that most have that sugar and/or sodium component, she said said, \"wait, do you like lemon?\" Sure! At which point she made up a sauce of lemon, ginger, garlic, wine and chili oil. It was fantastic! Brought out the flavors of the veggies nicely. At that point she told me to just ask for lemon, which is kept in the back...   Since then, I've visited several locations and asked for the \"secret sauce\" from the back. Without hesitation I always get my lemon.  Get this, a few times they have been out of the lemon, so the squeeze fresh for me! Doesn't get better than fresh.   I frequent the Germann YC's more than the other and they are super helpful and friendly - but they are all great.  Thank you YC Grill!"}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday, the service was great. A young lady with glasses was very nice and was very helpful. She helped me pick me certain flavor and gave me lots of suggestions. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is missing one key ingredient:  Flavor."}
{"text":"When you come here be ready to eat!   For those of you who do not know how this place works....you get a bowl and basically go to a buffet style set up where you pack raw meats and uncooked veggies into your bowl. You can put as much as you want, I wouldn't exactly say fit in your bowl, because the food is always overflowing. Once you have loaded up your bowl you pick the sauce(s) you want to use. There are recipes for different kinds of sauces available for you. After that, your food is cooked infront of you in about 3-5 minutes.   After that you take it to your table and enjoy...I would suggest filling your bowl up with a lot of noodles, even if your bowl is completely filled."}
{"text":"You can't beat the price. Service is efficient. The food is fair. Will I eat here again? Of course, but this place is definitely not in my top ten."}
{"text":"This is the only Mongolian restaurant I've tried, and I enjoy it enough. I always end up with a huge amount of leftovers, after observing some regulars fill their bowls and taking some cues from them. You need to pound the meat down to fill the bowl as it shrinks and comes in these obnoxious curls that take up valuable bowl space. No worries, they put out a bunch of wax paper since it is expected you will do this. They recently added new spices to the meat section which is a nice new addition.   Then you add your vegetables, followed by the two types of noodles - wheat and rice. I like to mix them both in my bowl as they each have different but good flavor. Don't be afraid to pile the noodles high! At the end are the various sauces and a chalkboard overhead gives you suggested recipes. Often times there are employees at the end there to help you tailor your flavors, but after a few goes at it you get the hang of it. Watching them cook on those superheated flat tops, moving the food around with long chopsticks is fun, and the food always comes off steaming hot.   All entrees come with soda, soup, and rice, and dinner entrees come with soft serve ice cream. To-go containers for leftovers are $0.50 extra, but you can order takeout for the regular price and not pay for the containers. If you order takeout, you still can get soda, soup and rice for no extra fee.  My wife, who has experienced more upscale Mongolian restaurants, was a bit disappointed by YC's. If you've had other Mongolian this might not live up to your expectations, but I don't know better so I enjoy it. I was addicted at first, but after a few visits I slowed down to an occasional visit."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my husband. We were greeted nicely and service was ok.   The food was decent to. When we left a few hours later we both got extreme food poisoning. Like super bad. I won't recommended this to anyone. Glad I don't have to work tomorrow.   Don't come here unless your wanting to call in sick the next day at work."}
{"text":"I am a conservative food person, so \"Mongolian grill\" is out of my wheel house... but let me tell you... this is a fave! I am a regular here. You can customize every Single time you order to exactly what you want. So yummy! I've finally gotten my sauce to how I like it! And... for those of us who like to be cheap, this is absolutely 2 meals!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, hot, affordable and filling!   Pro Tip:  Opt for the dinner sized bowl and also buy a to go container too.  Then cram as much stuff as you can in your silver bowl before they cook it.  Then fill half of the to go container with rice and pour all your leftovers into the take out container when you are done eating.  Viola!  Ready made lunch for tomorrow.  :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite's for over twenty years, they gotta be doing something right. It's a Tempe institution."}
{"text":"Very easy to overeat here if you're not careful. Over time with cooking experience of your own/making your own sauces will help you. Avoid creamy sauces, stick with yc's own and you're pretty much golden. Doggy boxes are .50 but use them because you'll have leftovers. Also load up on the chicken and vegetable soup; it comes with your meal and is pretty filling."}
{"text":"Always very clean, extrememly friendly staff and great food!!!! I'd u haven't been to ycs, its a must!! Staff is always willing to help u make you're own sauce or show u how to make their fav sauces for your bowl. And free ice cream!!! Cmon :)"}
{"text":"YC's is a pretty cool place to go.  Here's how it works: you get a bowl and you fill it up with anything you want, including sprouts, broccoli, carrots, onions, peppers, scary dehydrated meat and much more.    After all your ingredients are in your bowl, you then get to choose the sauces you want to put in it.  They have suggestions and recipes for you to follow, from sweet to super spicy. Or you can always make up your own.   Then the chef's wok it up for you and pour it all back into your bowl.  You can add some rice to it, sesame seeds or any other toppings that you want and choose a table to sit at.   My only warning is to vegetarians- you must ask the cook to clean off the grill before cooking yours because if you don't, you will get little pieces of meat in your bowl that have been left on the grill from someone else's meal!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they opened! Amazing fresh veggies and great flavors. If you master filling your bowl correctly you can eat and take home even more for later. Gotta love having control over every aspect of your meal. The staff are helpful if you are a first timer, so just ask. I love love love YCs!"}
{"text":"This is the only reliable Mongolian bbq place I've found locally. This is a great place to go for a quick lunch that's not fast food and not overpriced. For about $7.50, you can get a huge bowl of food, a cup of soup, a drink, and a to go box to take your leftovers with you. I usually get two meals out of one visit here.   The dining area is always clean. Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"1st experience here and absolutely loved everything about it! Can't believe I didn't know about this place till now! Friendly staff, clean and comfortable environment. And food was delicious and reasonably priced for the amount you get. Definitely will return :)"}
{"text":"I can now say this is my favorite YC's location(inside)! If you've never been here, it's like a build your own bowl... basically stack until you can't stack anymore!  I arrived about 5 minutes before opening and accidentally walked in early, but they welcomed me in... told me to have a seat and get a drink while they checked to make sure the cooks were ready for orders! All the staff were very friendly and helpful if you needed help with the sauces and choosing flavors to mix. The vegetable selection seemed endless and had more variety than any other one I've seen (yum, kale). This may be the first location I have heard one of the cooks hold a conversation as well while making the food. All in all, it was a great filling lunch walking distance from where I was getting my tires worked on.   One complaint I do have is the smell when walking in to the entrance, there is a strong sewage/garbage stench that just lingers... no one wants to smell that before or after they are done with their meal! Until that's fixed, I'm keeping at 4"}
{"text":"I always liked this place, making it the way I wanted. My disappointment is how much they raised prices and that they charge for To-go boxes $.50!?! WtH?Why??  Why on earth would you charge for To-go  it's not a buffet bar. It's $13 for lunch then you can't even take your leftovers?  Really horrible policy."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! A friend recommended I try this place and Wow! I love it! I love how it's buffet style. Plus it comes with soup and amazing wonton chips! Yummy! The staff helped me pick sauces to use and all told me to pack my bowl to the max! The price is about 13.00 but it was worth every penny! I had left overs! It became two meals for the price of one! I will make many trips here. Great concept and great food."}
{"text":"So many options!!! This is definitely my GO TO place!! I love the fact that they let you make it exactly how you want it! Such a great atmosphere and the employees working there are always super duper helpful!! We love YC's!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim.  It was excellent!  An extensive selection of fresh veggies and sauces.  We took half home."}
{"text":"Pack a Bowl. Love this place! Super nice staff, the manager always comes by and asks how things are going. Love the price and condiments are plentiful. I always have leftovers and they make for a great meal later that night! Packing a Bowl is an art forum and I have my technique down. Years of practice ya know. You have to crawl before you walk. Get some!"}
{"text":"I would be giving this 5 stars. However, they recently switched to Pepsi, and as a pregnant woman, that is a huge deal breaker.  Otherwise, the food is good (love the wonton chips!) and it's clean. The service has always been great and fast.  No complaints other than switching to Pepsi. Why YC's??? WHY??????"}
{"text":"A great place to eat, I think you get a lot for your money. You gather up some noodles put what ever you like in there. Pick what kind of flavor you like. But some of the flavors kind of taste the same to me. Oh plus they have chips, rice and soup. I always get all of it, a bowl of chips, a bowl of rice and soup! I get so full eating here, I always have leftovers."}
{"text":"I love YC's! Best place for a huge meal with tons of tasty leftovers. The place is clean and the hostess, while sometimes takes a while to get to the front, is always polite. The food is DELICIOUS and the fact that they give you recipes for the sauces is cool. My food always comes out amazing and the cherry on top is that even though it's not a full sit down restaurant, the hostess still checks on you to make sure your meal is fine.  **just something to mention: the cost for a doggy bag last time I was in was a mere $.50 plus tax and to pay that to have a great lunch the next day is so worth it for sure."}
{"text":"We would have had 5 Stars but what can a veggie eater expect when there is meat in the house.  Yep, I bit into a piece of burnt something. Now for the good part. Lots of choices and they give you ok to pile it one. Many options for seasonings and sauces. Rice bar and yogurt. Both are bottomless.   Folks stop in and go for it! Peace."}
{"text":"YC's is a great interactive meal. Start at the register and pay, then walk your way through the line picking your frozen meats, veggies, and topping with noodles and broths to make your custom stir fry meal. You'll see the pros with parchment paper in hand, smashing down the goods to make room for more. My fave meat is the beef, I love tons of celery, cabbage, carrots. I personally skip on the noodles to go for the steamed white rice. Also love the egg drop soup and breaking up some wonton strips into that. You pay for a takeout box, but it is always worth it for me to take home another full meal. Expect YC's burps for the next few hours. Warn your loved ones."}
{"text":"Skip the ballpark food, and get your grub on here after the game. Amazing customer service, and a Mongolian grill where they actually encourage squishing down the ingredients in your bowl if you want. About $13 for the big bowl, $14 ish for AYCE. I had a big bowl, and could only finish about half. Soda, tea, soup, rice included in the price. Worth the money."}
{"text":"I love coming here.  Being able to make my noodles the way I want is awesome plus the kids love it.  Very affordable too. It gets very busy around lunch time but the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Came in around 9 on Thursday evening they were closing down I understand that they close at 10 but the quality of the food should still be the same considering I'm paying the price for it very disappointed in the way I was treated by the staff and the quality of the food obviously been sitting there for a while was disgusting I will not be returning if you're open till 10 you should serve the same quality of food that you serve during the day"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years and years as the movie theatres and surrounding restaurants (and even an entire row of buildings!) has come and gone. YC's has remained and it's still as tasty as ever. Grab a bowl (don't bother getting the big one if you can save a buck, there's no way you'll be able to eat the full portion of even the smaller bowl, lol), grab a wax paper to smush all the good ingredients down into the bowl, and go to town. I like that they added extra bowls up by the sauces a while ago, since previously you were guaranteed to slosh sauce all over your tray :P  The ingredients are always fresh and tasty, they have a nice selection of options, and the sides at the end are nice (I like the tasty, if not a bit salty beef soup - add a glob of brown rice into it and mm it is delish!). Also, after trying Genghis grill - YC's system of keeping the meet choices cold/semi frozen is the way to go - the meat looked NASTY at Genghis in comparison.   It's not a fancy place, it's not the cheapest place for quick food... but man if you want to eat some dang tasty stir-fry until you need to unbutton your pants and call a flatbed truck to take you home - YC's is the place!"}
{"text":"Foods always good! And love that you get soup, drink, rice and ice cream with your meal! My son loved the selection and of course the ice cream. The staff was helpful and really friendly, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Way better then any of the other locations. The guy in there was super helpful with everyone. There's not much standing room when it gets busy but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The lady at the front was a total b*** though. I'd rather visit the location on McClintock. This one charges you extra for everything. If you eat to go it's fifty cents more & they have something against splitting your plate with your kid. Like are you serious!"}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant Saturday november 14 and had my leftovers on Sunday november 15. Tuesday morning I woke up violently ill and could not hold in food or fluids all day tuesday.   Went to the urgent care tuesday evening and they promptly sent me to the ER to be treated for severe dehydration caused by \"probably a food borne bacteria.\" I just finished my three day antibiotic course and am feeling much better, but now that I have had time to look at the facts and speak with the Maricopa County Department of Health, I can confidently say that my horrific three days of food poisoning were undoubtedly caused by YC's Mongolian Grill.  The fact that I was told someone else got a case of E.Coli with bloody stools just about a week before my poisoning really shored it up for me. YC's is apparently serving tainted or contaminated food. I would not recommend eating at this establishment. I must also make it clear that my noodles which I took home were transported from the restaurant to my refrigerator (20 minutes) and kept in the refrigerator until they were microwaved and consumed."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of YC's.  I wrote a nasty review and I was personally contacted by the owner who apologized and wanted to make it up to us.  We went back to the same YC's and were amazed at the impeccable customer service.  We had someone helping us every step of the way!  The food is always great!  We didn't experience any integrity issues this time.  :)  I recommend anyone to go here if you have a great appetite."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place this evening.  The only reason I don't give it a 1-star rating is because neither of us died.  Otherwise, it was a poor experience and we won't be returning.  First, When we get our bowls and begin filling them up, there's no shrimp.  I ask about shrimp and am told it's $1 extra.  So, shrimp costs $1 extra from the $11.85 we each paid but you're forcing us to buy the ice cream and drink as part of the $11.85?  I should have asked if they can subtract $1 for each of our meals because neither of us wanted the ice cream and subtract another $2 from my wife's meal because she only drinks tap water.  Bottom line here, I resent that we're being forced to buy the extras as they're included in the price, but we're to be charged more if we want shrimp.  Hey, Genghis Grill down at Tempe Marketplace has shrimp on the bar and doesn't charge extra and doesn't force you to buy a drink and ice cream.  Second, the various sauces were poorly marked with bowls of sauces with no corresponding label or a label with no corresponding sauce.  There were even sauces that were obviously not what the corresponding label indicated.  It was difficult to know what we were putting with our bowls.  Third, my wife didn't finish all her bowl so she asked or a container to take it home.  They charged her $0.50 for a takeout box.  Seriously????  We won't return and will instead drive the extra 5 miles or so to the Genghis Grill at Tempe Marketplace the next time we want Mongolian BBQ."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mongolian grills but this one creeps me out a little by not cleaning the grill between customers. They also wipe the seats and tables with the same towels. They don't seem to observe the same rules we're all taught."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! I can get so many great variety of veggies, and brown rice. They even have a great raspberry ice tea that I love! Everything is so inexpensive, the whole meal is under $15."}
{"text":"My favorite Mongolian BBQ joint in the Phoenix area. HUGE HUGE portions, the only place where they let you smash the meat with wax paper, so much sauce and even the side bar is delicious. DO IT and I dare you to finish everything in your bowl."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love coming here because I always get my fill and more. I don't even mind having to pay $.50 for a to go container because you get so much food for the price. And if you go at dinner it's an even better deal because frozen yogurt is included!!   The experience is amazing. I defiantly want all my friends to try this place at least once! ^..^"}
{"text":"I love coming to YC's because I know the food will always be delish. I love making my own plate of food and I love seeing it cooked before my eyes! The staff is always super friendly and helpful every time I come back."}
{"text":"My friend took me here, said I had to go and now I have been twice! This place rocks! The first time I went they helped me get started and gave me a free togo box, normally they charge 50 cents for it (which sounds weird, but isn't until you go).  This is a build your own Asian Meal place! AWESOME!! You can pick your meat, your veggies and your sauce and they cook it up for you- so fun and so yummy- each time you go you can get what you want, but switch up the sauces or keep it the same and since it is build your own, you will definitely have leftovers and they are just as good the second time around!"}
{"text":"We use to go to this place all of the time, until this past Saturday night when three out of the four of us ended up with food poisoning. I feel bad for posting this review, but for those of you who are reading it just be careful. We will never go back, which is a shame, but for so many of us to get food poisoning is not a coincidence. I'm just wondering how many other guests ended up getting sick that night as well."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a mongolian grill.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  Basically you fill your bowl with everything you want in it and someone else cooks it.  If you don't like your meal, you have no one to blame but yourself.    I thought it was odd that they charge for take-out boxes.     My wife thought that the pineapple & vanilla icecream reminded her of a Dole Whip from Disneyland.  I would come back for sure and next time see about following their recommendations for seasonings."}
{"text":"I visit one of the YC's locations almost every month. The process of picking your own ingredients and sauces, having them grilled for you, and the ultra fresh taste of food just cooked is unique. An amazing value at about $10! Their hot mustard sauce is spot on."}
{"text":"Tried this for dinner again last night...  This is such a good, healthy meal and at such a reasonable price. The ingredients are so fresh and the experience of getting it right off the grill is really cool. Dinner was exactly $10 each and included the drink, tax, etc...   The atmosphere here is nice for $10 meals. Lunch and dinner rush can get a little hectic."}
{"text":"We headed over to YC's on a Saturday night. A little more casual than we were looking for on a Saturday night, but that was our choice.   We had no idea what to do and one of their helpful employees explained everything. While I could have liked what I put together more I now have a better idea what to do for my next visit.  The best part was going to the car show just outside the door after dinner on a Saturday night.  This is the type of place Arizona needs more of."}
{"text":"Friendly hostess explained the process of how YC's works. There's two different bowls sizes that you can fill with as many ingredients you want. Protein options are pork, chicken, beef and fish. Veggies and sauces are endless. Each meal comes with a drink and a side of soup and rice (white or brown). The drink options consist of teas and Pepsi. There's also frozen yogurt available. My bowl was tasty. I added chicken and beef with udon noodles and a variety of veggies. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Go for the experience not necessarily for the food. Staff was friendly and helpful but I was not impressed enough to make it a regular eating spot."}
{"text":"This place is overall fantastic.  Been going for over 10 years.  It is always consistently good.  Service is always great.  (employees seem to stay there for long time)  Hard to find a better, fresher, and less expensive place to eat.  Very good value for the money!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened, and visiting the Pavilions since it opened in the early 90's.  I'm also a reputable business owner, and a valley resident since '79.  I know good management and a good crew when I see one.  Geoff and his long time crew are amazing.  My wife and I eat here like clockwork every single week.  It is miraculous that they stay so on top of everything with the business/volume that they do.  The employees here are clearly a reflection of the 5 star management, and this is a well run operation.  I do have one complaint- I've gone to other \"wok\" places and Mongolian style places, expecting the same thing- boy am I spoiled from YCs... they don't even come close- we \"woked\" away without even eating at YC's competition."}
{"text":"Yc never disappoints your pretty much in charge&I love to be in charge you pick your protein,carbs,veggies and of course the delicious sauces/oils as well as seasoning salts as much or as little or you can just go to the servers which are very kind to help you out to make up your mind then after just wait for magic grill done by Mongolian specialist or I like to call them BBQ gurus to cook it all up for ya you will leave happy&on a full tummy oh an FYI don't forget to try out their soups for the day very tasty"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've been coming here for years. However the price seems to keep going up...used to take my family of 5 there for $35-40...now we are $65-$70...then if you don't finish they charge you for boxes to put your left overs in. They get you coming in and going out...we won't be frequent flyers any longer....too bad cause we really like this place."}
{"text":"Love the concept of pick-your-own veggies, meats and oils/seasonings and turn it into a high protein, tasty, hot stir fry meal.  I highly suggest you follow one of the recipes posted above the stir fry area if you're unsure of which seasonings and sauces you should use.  I used quite a bit of several sauces (well, I thought it was quite a bit) and the flavor wasn't terribly strong.  But it was still very tasty.  The only draw backs for me is there is little ambiance (it feels somewhat like a cafeteria) and you will be charged a dollar for a to-go box.  I'd rather be charged an extra dime for my meal than having folks being nickle and dimed for a to-go box.  It just doesn't leave me with a good feeling to discover, after a nice meal, that I have to pay to take my leftovers home.  I believe they have no problem with folks bringing in a plastic container, though."}
{"text":"If you don't like this spot it's your own fault for not making your bowl the way you should have. Fresh meat and vegetables cooked right in front of you so it HAS to be fresh and hot. Getting your sauces correct and also using lots of it. I always get a second bowl to pour flavor sauce in. Absolutely delicious!  Staff was also very friendly,  been eating here for 15 years and never doesn't satisfy."}
{"text":"This place can either be 2 star or 4 star, depending upon the quality of the veggies they use. Sometimes the veggies are nasty and seem expired. Other times they are fresh and crisp. They offer plenty of sauces to flavor your dish with. However, the meat here is nasty as hell. It is frozen, nasty crap. I stick to veggies here... Overall good place if they keep their stuff fresh."}
{"text":"I do like a mongolian BBQ, but I have to say that this one is just average.  Although they have a selection of meat that's so-so, they don't back it up with many additional items.  Their spice selections are standard, and they have recipes for sauces on a board WAY high in the air (I missed it until someone pointed me in the right direction) but the grillers cook your food in a way that kind of creates a flavoring that is a melange of the other things cooking.  Filling, satisfying, but not all that remarkable."}
{"text":"Went into the resturant last night with my husband and daughter and baby. Didn't know how the whole system worked... The lady that checked us in explained everything and was super friendly. The food tasted nice and fresh and the portion was huge. The kids were super excited to find out the meal came with ice cream at the end. Right before we left the lady working at the front came and asked how everything was. The costumer service was on point and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"There was a Mongolian BBQ place I went to for 20 years and apparently they went out of business. So I've been looking for someplace new to replace it and saw this one while driving around and thought I would check it out. Overall, everything was pretty good. They have a nice selection of veggies, noodles, meat and sauces to choose from. I didn't try any of the soups but my bowl was pretty good. I'm sure I will be back again now that I understand the process a little better and have tried the food."}
{"text":"This is your typical Mongolian grill. Fill your bowl, watch it shrink and then stuff your face. Good food, decent prices. Military, veterans and seniors get a 10 percent discount. Soft serve ice cream is also available."}
{"text":"Ugh, I hate how it's $11.50 for a bowl. Granted, it's a pretty big size- but still a ridiculous price. Might as well go for the $12.50 ayce. At least then you can vary your taste buds.  The food itself is good. Lots of choices and sauces. I like how they write all the sauce recipes out on the board for you so that you can make something better than whatever concoction you'll come up with.   If you don't prefer noodles- you should just fill up your bowl with beef and veggies and eat it with the complimentary rice at the end! ;)  The drink machine, soups, ice cream, and choices of brown/white rice at the end are a nice touch."}
{"text":"If I had to pick a last meal, it'd be ycs! Just saying! I could live off of it! Come to Phoenix !!!"}
{"text":"We moved to Colorado awhile back and I can honestly say we have not found anything like this. I've been coming here since they first opened as a kid. I don't remember if it was this location! My dad and I went every Sunday! Every friend or family member who walked my path I take them here for dinner now I live 1000 miles away and CRAVE this place!!! I miss it!!!! I think I need to franchise Denver LOL!!! We even got a free dinner for leaving a rave review!!!"}
{"text":"This may not be the best Mongo Bongo I have ever had but it is the best in PHX. The staff is always nice and helpful and you don't like the meal, well you made it, try again.  It is not cheap but reasonable for what you get. I drag my friends there once and they always want to go back.  Give it a shot you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"This is good mongolian for a chain-like restaurant.  I have been here a fews times and I was very happy with the service, and freshness of the food!  I'll be back again. Oh be sure to fill your sauce bowl up to about 3/4 so you selection of flavors dont get watered down."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  Just how Mongolian BBQ should be. The staff was very helpful. The hostess was able to help my mother who has food allergies and made sure my son had a full bowl. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when you're really hungry. I'm a big guy and a small bowl packed is plenty of food. You feel like you're eating healthy but the sodium content is really high so don't be too fooled."}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place. My #1  favorite. They need more locations Glendale, peoria , metro phoenix would be great."}
{"text":"The best place to eat a healthy bowl. Only thing I hate are the locations there are just not enough locations. I would spend so much $ here to eat with my family if they had a Glendale/Peoria location even metro Phoenix at the least. I only have a very lil opportunity to stop by when work takes me near by.  1 place to eat."}
{"text":"Great variety of fresh items, inexpensive, fast, efficient and friendly service! What else could you want ? A winner in my book!"}
{"text":"I revisited this location recently as a comp from the manager and, it was a wonderful experience.  The (assuming newer) manager runs a tight ship at this location, and it shows.  Patrons were much more well behaved than last time and the service was more friendly than I remember as well.  I LOVE Mongolian food but unfortunately any time I crave it I have to treck from the West side of town to the land of great Mongolian restaurants, which is the East Valley.    Normally, I go to the location on the 101 and Indian Bend, but my fiancé and I decided that we liked this location much better after our visit as it has a more laid back calmer atmosphere.  Everything was clean and organized.  I avoided the fish altogether this time, and opted for steak/chicken.  The veggie variety was amazing and they have sriracha available as well.  Sriracha is my new found LOVE, and any place that offers it, is A-OK with me.  All in all, I will definitely return, and thank the manager for making me a believer and a HUGE fan of this location of YC's Mongolian Grill."}
{"text":"I love this place, I come here quite often for lunch or dinner.  Only dislike is having to pay. 50 cents for a Togo box...? I mean it's only. 50 cents but still just include it in your pricing don't make me have to dish out some coins which I never carry."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what just happened to me.  I just ate a bunch of flash-frozen meat that was white, curled, and stiff.  I put it in a bowl and mashed it with a napkin, put some even less fresh looking veggies on it, and handed it to an angry mexican who proceeded to cook it on something that looked like the urinals in Sun Devil Stadium.  I didn't like preparing my own food for this price, I don't like that they KNOW the meat shrinks but won't give you a decent sized bowl to put enough in it - although...with as nasty as the meat tasted, why would you want any more of it?  I might go back here and just do noodles and sauce.  The noodles were the only thing that seemed safe to eat and the sauce (you make your own) was the only thing redeeming about this place.  I was definitely missing the Wendy's that used to be in this spot."}
{"text":"I get really excited about YC's Mongolian BBQ. I love the concept, prices, and how quick it is on a busy night. They also help you choose your sauces which can be rather confusing if you dont know what you are doing. I am a picky eater so it is nice that i get to pick everything that goes into my bowl. Also, you really get a ton of food.   No complaints, well maybe that there isnt one close to me.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Kinda went in the wrong line and messed up but the woman at the from was super nice. She said that I pay first and thanks for being honest :). She walked me through it all and wished me a good day. Just got over being sick so wanted something basic. She helped me avoid anything that would upset my stomach and I went on my merry way.   I can't believe I lived near this and haven't been once ever!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand why you would pour an entire pitcher of water on the food your grilling. All the sauce and spices you add to your meal just get washed right off. Bye bye flavor.... Also, the cooks need to find some personality. I get you're probably working for minimum wage but your tip jar would fill up faster with a simple \"Hello, how are you?\""}
{"text":"Mmmm! Love it! Pack as much as you can into the bowl and bring home your leftovers! I can get two meals out of this place for the price of 1! Always a good go to, happy there is one in Gilbert close to my house."}
{"text":"the absolute best! if you're going to try any YC's around for the first time, this would be the go-to location"}
{"text":"I have eaten there before and I'll keeping eating there. The food and veggies are so fresh. Service is great as they will mix your flavor for the wok. I think the ice cream should be free. Asking a $1.00 for a cup after spending $22.00 for two people for lunch is odd. Regardless, the flavors are fantastic the way everything is cooked. Having a huge selection of drinks is great and the rice selection is a wow. This is a must stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff. I start a vegan diet and the staff help me around to pick my food"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for places that are allergy friendly. My fiancé was craving something Asian flavored, but finding a place that knows when the sauce has shrimp or oyster sauce in it can be tricky. This place has everything labeled by soy/gluten/fish etc and I didn't have any issues post meal!"}
{"text":"Make sure you mush as much as you can in your bowl, hee hee. :)  A fun and good place for some Asian!"}
{"text":"So far is the best mongolian grill ive been too.  maybe cuz is the first official mongolian grill ive been to. ive been to buffets that have a grill in the back but is not the same.  This one was diff and more delicious. Ive been here a couple of times and let me tell u is really good. i like the fact that u can make ur own sauce. Also i like that u can take ur left overs and eat them later."}
{"text":"I love Mongolian grills, and YC's has to be among the best I've had.  Infinite combinations of deliciousness for an extremely reasonable price, and the employees are always friendly and helpful.  Drinks are included, and so is rice, wonton noodles, and soup.  I've never left hungry, that's for sure.  I only wish they'd open one on the west side of the valley so I could eat there more often.    A great place.  Try it."}
{"text":"Its fun to make your own bowl, controlling how much meat and what type of veggies go in it.  The Sauce station is where the magic happens, so much to pick from.  Then after all the goodness is jammed into your bowl you hand it off to the cook to fry it up which takes about 3 minutes.  The wait staff is really fun and outgoing and since it was our first time, our waitress showed us the ropes.  My wife and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visiting Tempe on work, I was excited to see a Mongolian BBQ, as California doesnt seem to have good quality mongolian places. I walked in and ordered a huge bowl - seemed like a good price at $11.50 for a bowl, drink, and rice. Food was great and cooked well.  The fun thing started when I checked my credit card that I was charged $29 instead of $11.50. Interestingly, I remembered that the lady who charged me at the hostess desk didnt even offer me my receipt. A few days later, I called the manager and let him know. He took down my name, address and how much I was overbilled, and told me that he would send me a check in the mail and call me when he did so. Two weeks, and I am yet to hear from him.  Most of all - no apology for screwing a customer and over billing him.  Needless to say, I am never going back when I am back in town for business. I have also let our team of 500 employees in the building next door about this issue. I am guessing a lot of folks are interested in never going back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Delicious food. Good atmosphere (mood lighting).  They encourage you to pile your bowl as high as you want which is awesome as you have two meals worth of leftovers. Make sure that you add plenty of sauce to your food otherwise it may taste a little bland (especially if you pile it super high like I do). I recommend at least ten scoops of sauce for a super full bowl. They also have soup, rice, won tons and fountain drinks included with the price. This place is definitely a great value and is delicious to boot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a neat stir fry place with a design-your-own approach. They have a nice variety of meat, vegetables and sauces you can create for your meal.  The place is well maintained and looks pretty modernized. The line may look crowded as you first walk in, but it moves pretty fast. For a place with a good cooked-to-order meal, it's still less of a wait than if you sat down to dine.   The meat shrinks during cooking, so make sure you get a double portion. There is an option for a 50 cent take out container, if you strategize and pile high enough (use wax paper at the start of the line to pack down the food) its petty easy to get enough for a second meal for later.  Words of caution though-the rice noodles are harder to stack, get wheat noodles if you have your heart set on seconds. Also, the entire bowl comes out very very hot at first when you sit down,   Edit: I was originally perplexed to see the chicken frozen in rolls, but received a message from the owner who thoughtfully described the preparation to plate process, to create fresh chicken pieces that are ready to easily be cooked the day after they are received. Now I am even more sold on this place.  ."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service. It was my first time in, and they were very helpful and friendly.   They had a nice selection of food to put in a bowl. I appreciated the vegetarian and gluten-free options.   I did not care much for the soup or the won tons. The rice was ok. My bowl turned out good, but I was kind of surprised at the price. It seemed pretty expensive considering the soup and wontons were just ok.   I might go back, but I'm not in a huge hurry."}
{"text":"I never get tired of this place. I always enjoy my meal and you can always leave full, no matter how hungry you are when you come in."}
{"text":"I like the options here and it's okay food but just not my favorite place to go.  Hubby and  I go once in a while when we want something different but really it tastes like a lot of other Asian restaurants only you get to decide what you put in it."}
{"text":"Good food but prices going up and bowls getting smaller.  .50 to take home leftovers that don't fit in your small more expensive bowl."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place, but the last time I went I think I got food poisoning. My stomach was killing me for hours after I ate here. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch of tofu, or if they did't cook everything through, but I was in a great amount of pain. They do however accommodate to various allergens which is good. For example, if you're Vegan, they'll clean off the grill for you before cooking your food, which is very kind. My dad didn't have any problems with his meal, so I think the issue might've been the tofu because he got beef and was fine."}
{"text":"The portions here are huge! Usually, mongolian bbq places give you a tiny bowl and I find all kinds of ways to maximize the space but here I pretty much don't need to. (although I still do and I end up with 2 big takeout boxes. haha) besides that, they give you rice and soup. so it's a good deal.  I'll tell you my secret: first you unroll the frozen pieces of meat and you flatten them with your napkin. Cover the bottom of the bowl. then you line broccoli with the heads pointed out of the bowl all around the rim. This makes your bowl bigger. then you pile up everything else you want on top. haha. :D"}
{"text":"OK, this place has always been pretty good, and is great if you know the ingredients/flavors you like, but don't want to cook it yourself (Like at a Hot Pot place).  I have never written a review because I was eating there before I had ever visited Yelp, but recently they added a new \"Thai Peanut Chili Sauce\" and several seasonings that you can add to your food (IE: lemon pepper, cumin, and some combination spices).  This is a great improvement, and really increased my impression of their overall quality.  With these new improvements, I would say YC's is the best Mongolian BBQ I have personally had."}
{"text":"Loved this place for years, food is still great but now it's priced too high for a lunch. I remeber when lunch was $7, now at $12 I cannot afford it, I didn't get a raise"}
{"text":"delicious, lots of food! happy people who work here and seem to love their job and working together creates a positive environment for the customers! PLEASE OPEN THE FROYO MACHINE FOR LUNCH"}
{"text":"Usually the service is good but tonight we had a horrible experience. The workers kept giving my boyfriend a hard time for how he was filling up his bowl. (And laughing at him too for the way he was doing it. SO unprofessional) the cook kept giving my boyfriend dirty looks too. The cook didn't even property cook my meal correctly. My eggs were runny/mushy and my veggies were undercooked. And it's kind of ridiculous to charge for a to go box. Like I said, in the past we've always usually had a positive experience which is why I'm being generous giving 3 stars, but tonight was just not up to par with what we are use to and for that I'd rate it maybe a 2."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but always prefer Genghis. YC's is a place where you get to make your own stir fry. Compared to Genghis, you will get way bigger portions which is definitely a plus. Also, they offer rice and other things for sides in addition to your bowl. I don't know if I just don't get the right sauce or what... I like things saucy. Whether it be wings or anything really that requires sauce. It needs to be super saucy. This applies to my stir fry. Whenever I use their sauces, it seems that the sauce is super thin and just not as tasty as Genghis. :( It is possible that I just haven't put the right ingredients together, though. Maybe someday I'll try it one more time to see if I get it right."}
{"text":"Friendly staff who were helpful in explaining how the food bar and prices worked. The meat choices were limited. Vegetable selection was ok. All the sauces were a bit bland. Don't be afraid to go crazy on it since they don't stick too much during the stir fry. They do have soup and rice also. The ice cream left a weird feeling on my tongue."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Lunch time it's $9.00 for a large bowl and a drink.  Comes with unlimited brown or white rice and soup.  Not a bad deal at all.  This is your typical Mongolian BBQ spot... thin frozen meats, veggies, sauce, slap onto round grill, eat.  My only complaint with this place is I feel there are too many sauce choices.  My favorite Mongolian BBQ spot (near UCLA) had two options:  garlic Yes/No and spicy Yes/No, other than that the sauce master did his work and the dish turned out amazing.  YC's has like 10 different sauce combination they present to you and I feel that the last 3 times I've been here I could have chosen better.... but frankly, I don't know because I never remember which one I chose previously.  In this case, like AbuJ likes to say, too much customization is not good.  Perhaps I'm just \"chasing the dragon\" and trying to get it to taste like my favorite UCLA joint and I'll never reach that high again no matter how much I try, but damnit, I'm going to try a few more times since UCLA is a 6hr drive on a good day.  The hostess / cashier was easy on the eyes, as was the sauce girl.  Both pretty friendly too.  Girls tend to flirt with me, so nothing unusual here.  +.5 stars for this."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of YC's. I work right next to this location, so we frequent it for lunch. My favorite thing about YC's is not only the fact that the food is fantastic, but they let you pile the food as high as you can. It's always a competition amongst my co workers to see who can stack their food the highest. You just have to buy a $.50 cent to go box and you have lunch for the next day.   The staff is always super friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the variety of food never disappoints. I have absolutely no complaints for YC's."}
{"text":"First time and I definitely will become a regular. Several locations around the east valley. Paleo and gluten free friendly! Lots of veggie and meat items to choose from to fill your bowl.   Tip: wax paper sheets at beginning of ala Carte line are provided so you can smash down the meat and veggies as you go down the line and fit more into your bowl."}
{"text":"Yet again, you guys amaze me and my partner with your wonderful service and food. Thanks for helping speed up the line with helping others with getting their plates mixed and keeping the toppings stocked. Again thank you we will be back more and more."}
{"text":"Staff was more than helpfull, I felt like it was a great value, if you like great khans you will love this place way more of a variety, food was delicious! I wish there was one in san diego!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The staff is always very kind and helpful, the food is fresh, and I love the options and flavors they have. The way they price for children is PERFECT (.55 for year year of age) Also, you can't beat that you also get soup, rice, a drink and ice cream with your dinner."}
{"text":"First time here and the whole experience wow'd us. I have never had better customer service in a restaurant.  They were so helpful and friendly. The food is so good! I had the Chefs Favorite sauce and it was very flavorful. Even though we live in Avondale, we will be back. Hope to see one open in the west valley!"}
{"text":"I remember coming to YC's as a kid.... I loved mixing all of the sauces and piling my bowl high with noodles and veggies.... I loved that they had soft serve ice cream...crispy wontons..... soup..... Well, nothing has changed! YC's is exactly as I remember it from years ago. The only thing that changed is it's actually a little pricey.... over 10$ even at lunch. Closer to 15 at dinner. Extra charge for a to go box (which is 100% necessary....trust me). Anyway, I loaded my bowl with all kinds of veggies.... added some of their weird freeze dried beef (it looks weird, but it tastes good, so who am I to judge)....piled noodles on top.... and poured on various sauces including a ridiculous amount of chili oil and garlic. Don't get me wrong, this is no authentic Asian food restaurant....but the flavor is pleasant regardless. Between my noodles, two different types of soup, and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce I was super stuffed and had two additional meals from the leftovers. I would definitely return...but probably only at lunch."}
{"text":"The Manager was kind enough to reach out to us after our unfortunate first experience.  My hubby and I looked forward to a more positive return visit-and we were pleased with our meal.  We both created a bowl with the Kung Pao sauce and it was very tasty.  The restaurant was clean and maintained.  We enjoy healthy eating and are glad we have a spot to return to when we get a \"yen\" for YC's."}
{"text":"I like eat a lot of vegetables and I love them stirfried why sees doesn't excellent job and I enjoy going there OK so then I've got there"}
{"text":"Aside from the employees who feel the need to police you to make sure you don't share, (a rule which I understand when I read it, when the cashier explains it, AND when the busser fills me in) it's generally a clean, well maintained establishment. You can't complain about the food, since it's up to you to create your own dish.  Wish they had egg as an add in option like Ghengis Grill.   Drink and soft serve yogurt are included in the price of your meal. To go boxes for fifty cents a pop."}
{"text":"They have a clean, efficient setup, a selection of decent (flash frozen) meat, and plenty of fresh veggies and sauces. If the meat were fresh or the price a bit lower I'd add the fifth star, but ultimately everything else in your experience comes down to your skills. I get 3 tasty meals out of my visit, and here is my strategy:  1. Get some butcher paper and repeatedly crush down your meat to create a secondary \"meat bowl\" effect. This allows more meat and less mess.  2. Spices: don't be shy.  3. Veggies: feel free to have a small pile, and use butcher paper to scrunch it down.  4. Noodles: gotta do the trifecta, but end with a big pile of wheat noodles. They weigh everything down.  5. Sauce: if following these instructions, double the recipe on the board, pour a few scoops on the noodles themselves, and add some hot chili oil for good measure.  6. Cooking: don't miss the crunchy and sweet things at the end. If you like those things, they are available.  7. Tips: tip the cook. It's hot back there.  8. Post-Game: You will not finish this. You will have extra sauce on the bottom. Get 2 bowls of brown rice to soak up that delicious sauce and get two to-go cartons worth of awesome leftovers. They will be better the next day after soaking up flavors overnight.  9. Label your cartons. People are crazy.  There ya go. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This is Asian your way! You pay for one of three sizes of bowls that you can heap with a nice variety of vegetables, meats, and noodles. They are all displayed in a buffet line. Once your bowl is filled, you proceed to the sauce table. Here you select your grilling sauces. Someone will offer to custom blend your sauce. I like to be adventurous so I mix my own. You then proceed to the grill area where your dish is grilled before your eyes. My only issue is that they don't clean the grill between orders so someone with a food allergy could experience cross contamination. Your meal comes with rice, soup, a drink, and ice cream. This was a good experience. I thought the price was a little high. But you are encouraged to take home the leftovers."}
{"text":"I often stop here as a lunch nearby work. The people are always friendly and helpful.  Sometimes it is SUPER BUSY during lunch, bit I usually have time to eat and get back to work on time.  The food is great! The ingredients are fresh and well-cooked.  My go-to sauce? 3 YC's Own 3 Garlic 2 Ginger Hot Chili Oil Sriracha after cooking"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here almost 2-3 years ago, and since the first time, we've visited this location many, many times. It's a great place to go when you want a filling, healthy meal for lunch.  I've always been a fan of DIY/Cook it yourself places. (I.E. Korean BBQ and Hot pots.)  I usually try stuffing as many ingredients into the bowl, sometimes it requires punching down the frozen slices of meat you first throw in. And you have to get a lot of sauce otherwise you're not going to taste anything. When I first came here I had no idea on what sauce combinations to use, its nice they put up a sign above the grill so anyone new to YC's can start out from and branch out adding different combos."}
{"text":"2nd visit here years  The food is as good a time as it was the 1st I reckon this place the girls were very helpful and understanding and then you have the recommended come back again"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here after the car show last weekend.  The concept is part fun, part weird: watching them cook your food = fun. Trying to concoct your own meal, complete with spices, sauces, oils and \"squishing\" = a little weird.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. They explained the \"squish\" concept when I told them I was a first timer, and there was a helpful gentleman at the end of the line to help me make up a sauce.  I was weirded out by the shaved, frozen meat. It makes sense that they need to keep it this way (frozen to maintain safety, shaved thin to cook fast), but it is still a bizarre sight and I was hesitant to use it. All the veggies were super fresh, so I loaded up on those.  All you can eat soup, wontons, rice and soft serve. I was disappointed that the soups were so basic (chicken noodle and beef vegetable? How about some egg drop!?) The wontons were ok and the soft serve was meh. Didn't bother with the rice.  My problem was that, at the end of it all, I had a large bowl of not-that-great stir fry. How many times do you need to experiment until you find a sauce/spice/oil/cooking wine ratio that actually tastes good? THIS IS WHY I EAT OUT, PEOPLE....so I can get a guaranteed yummy meal, not take my chances!  And as another review stated, it is super odd to go down this buffet line watching people pile, stuff and cram food into these bowls, trying to get every last ounce of their money's worth. Yes, it shrinks a little while cooking, I'm sure. But people were acting like animals with the wax paper and extra bowls, using their entire body weight to smoosh their own food. Not an appetizing sight.  I might be willing to give it one more shot with another sauce compilation, but after that I think I'm done."}
{"text":"The bestie LOVES this place. The Husband LOVES this place. Needless to say, I spend a lot of time at YCs. Good fresh food, with nutritional information online so there are no surprises if you plan ahead -- great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Bomb.Com as always!!! So good!! Went last night with a friend and we both made massive bowls. Enjoyed every bite. Even had a bite of the raspberry frozen yogurt which was delish. This place never disappoints. A little pricey ($12.50 per person) But worth it because it is so dang good! I definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food, sorry no beer... but worth it all. What more can you say, it is excellent for the price."}
{"text":"So I have visited this place several times in between my first review and this review and they have managed to keep their 5 star rating. Tonight was the epitome of it all! I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too.   The staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said \"sure\" and made her food to perfection.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"So happy there is one of these in Chandler now!! I used to frequent the Indian Bend/101 location when I lived in Fountain Hills but since moving to Chandler, that's a bit of a drive for me...not that it's worth it because it totally is!  This location is set up a little bit different and I kind of like how the chips/rice/soup is separate from the cooking station...and I like how the drink station has it's own designated counter. It helps free up a lot of the traffic around the cooking area. The one thing I don't like is the cooking area seems to be very close to where people have to wait for their food to be cooked, which becomes very crowded and holds up the line. Also, when the chefs pour on water, the steam can engolf the people waiting for their food. Also, when the chef goes to clean the cook top, sometimes the dirty water splashes and hits people or gets mixed in with the cilantro and peanuts that's off to the side. I wish this was designed a little better because people literally trip over you, which can be annoying.   When I visited there were tons of fresh veggies and meats available and the place was very clean. Usually the sauce area tends to get really dirty but this one was relatively clean. They have all the standard veggies...to name a few: carrots, cabbage, spinach, celery, bean spouts, kale, green onions, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and baby corn.   It's nice being able to create your own stir fry and choose how much of what you want goes in it. It's definitely a healthier alternative to burgers and fries....and much tastier if you ask me!"}
{"text":"I've Only been to YC's one time after going to a place called Stir Crazy in Chicago with the same concept. My 'creation' was bad... Un edible .. But it was all my fault. I doused my meal in sauce,.. And salt.. And more sauce.. After receiving the tip from a boyfriend at the time that it was necessary. Oops.. But I did enjoy the soup and after adding plenty of rice to soak up the excess salt/sauce, it wasn't too bad. The ice cream was great and the people were friendly:) I'll be back experienced and with a much better rating :)"}
{"text":"Five stars, you ask? Yes. Not one to be excessive, but having been a YCs follower since the scant, quarter-scrounging days of ASU, I adore the value and creativity behind the Mongolian grilling concept. I can have whatever I want, from full-on carnivorous bowl of spice to veggie-fied curry heaven. Noodles or rice, soup or wontons . . . all of the above--no restrictions. Just grab the gleaming, white bowl in the size you select, pay the charming server up front (remember to add in a dollar or two to tip the cooks) and off you go down the buffet line. Frozen meat is an oddity at first. Remember that it shrinks when cooked; so, put double what you expect to see on the other end. The wheat noodles, in their swirly curly happiness, expand; so, be sure not to go tower of Pisa on them. Here is my fave recipe for low-carb excess (like getting the colonel's fried chicken notes): turkey, sprouts, spinach, cabbage, carrot, zucchini, mushroom, tofu, scallion, broccoli . . . then ladles: two black bean, two orange, one Thai, three ginger, one garlic, one cooking wine, one sesame oil. I add a few jalapenos, sesame seeds and some cilantro to the mix before it hits the grill. The long wooden poles, surface-of-the-sun hot grill and dexterity will entrance you. The staff is attentive and focused on cleanliness. Top notch ratings in several publications, and I agree."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I only wish there was a way to remember which sauce I like. I always spend forever debating which to try and haven't managed to get it quite as good as the first time I came in. This place is a lot of fun. I recommend overstuffing your bowl and getting a box"}
{"text":"Had lunch today for the first time. Everything looked clean and we'll stocked. Very informative greeter and cashier.  She walked us through the process and they stir-fried one of the best lunches we have had in a while. The sauce or something must have gone bad because in less than an hour my partner and I were throwing up and VERY VERY sick. 9 hours later we have stopped throwing up but have bad headaches. I have had food poisoning many times before and this is in the top ten."}
{"text":"Better than ever, they have tofu and a lot more vegetable options, I was really impressed after not eating here for many years."}
{"text":"I actually love Mongolian grills.  We paid at the beginning for the large bowl. For the two of us it was about 30 dollars. We got our food (their ingredients are not expensive and we're definitely on the older side. Cabbagw, carrots, chicken sliced thin, beef sliced the same way, water chestnuts, sprouts, etc.)  We started eating. We had so.e left over. Now remember this is not a buffet. They have a specific bowl you have to put the ingredients you want into it. You cannot stack the food higher than a certain point. That is why there are two sizes.  Remember we already paid and tipped. Now I ask for a to go box.  They told me it will be 50 cents. Excuse me? They tried to tell me it's based on the concept that people can put an uncontrollable amount of food on the plate. That is a lie. They have the silver bowl in the beginning which is used to control the portion of the food. I have worked in restaurants and they are not going to get away with this, at least mot with me. Yes, sometimes people are able to stack a lot of food in their bowl.  But for the quality of the ingredients, the ingredients themselves and the silver bowls used to keep it from going over a certain proportion, couple with (if under good management) the fact that some people eat less than others it evens out.  For the amount I had would have only cost about 5 dollars. They are makin g a profit.  How dare you wait until we are happy, full, and satiated, and paid for to say we have to pay for to go bowls!  Your solution is that I should pay for the bowls in the beginning?! No. I will not pay for to go bowls. That is rediculous! We asked if we took to much. They said no. Well then why are we getting charged! They are making a profit. We were happy and you get business.... why did you ruin it on this? You are not a buffet. Even buffets have to go orders. You pay them fill up the plate as much as you want and leave.  It's not about the 50 cents it's the principal.  It's insulting. We did not take to much food, I didn't finish it so I wanted to take it home."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet!  We eat at YC's weekly. It is a consistently great meal made just the way you want it.  Staff is friendly, and you will never leave hungry!  Their prices have recently increased, and frozen yogurt is now an additional charge (at dinner too)."}
{"text":"When you can't decide what to eat and you're in the area, this is a decent spot. Buffet style but you make your own bowl. I got the large bowl thinking I couldn't pack in the protein or noodles in a regular size but I was fooled. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and their food was delicious! I was confused on what to do since I hadn't been here before but everyone here was so willing to help! Price is fair for what they offer and their soups of the day were vegetable chicken and spices beef (both were awesome)."}
{"text":"So I thought they were similar with Genghis Grill - yes they were except that GG has wider selection of meat. I did not know about the \"fisting\" and smashing of the meat to make room for more LOL . I asked my husband what the onion-skin paper is for that were sitting beside the meat counter. Come here with some strong fist and smash your meat all the way to the bottom and that is how you get more food!! It was fun. I like that they have bamboo shoots veggies that's the only veggie I get, and really it's magic that even if you put a little bit of all the sauce they have, still comes out very tasty! So you don't have to really worry about your food not coming out yum, the amazing cook will probably do the magic! By the way, small bowl to me would be good for 2 decent size meals!"}
{"text":"I've been to various locations around the valley and they are pretty much the same. I enjoy the concept of creating my own meal. You can get help with the creation of your own sauces if you need it. I've either followed their recipes provide on a large chalkboard or just experimented with my own concoction.  I've never been disappointed. I'm marking this location down 1 star only because there was a woman walking around sweeping and pulling dirt into all the isles. That was followed by a push mop where she would randomly shake it. The most sits right where customers bring there food to be cooked on the grill. It just didn't seem professional or hygienic."}
{"text":"A clean, efficiently run Mongolian Grill?  The standard assortment of meats, veggies, and noodles, with fresh and plentiful selections.  A massive selection of sauces, including recommended mixes to get typical flavors?  Good to decent pricing (appreciate that it comes with a beverage, but I can see how that might rub others the wrong way).  All in all a very enjoyable experience, I'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I came back to YC's this past Saturday night and it seemed like the employees were really staying on top of keeping the buffet line organized and clean as well as the dining area.  However, the people there were being careless and letting the part of the tongs that their hands touched fall back into the food! C'mon people, that's gross!  I think YC's should develop a way to reduce the transfer of germs to food - like maybe installing hooks where the tongs can be hung so they are not thrown back into the food?  Also maybe a hand sanitizer station before entering the buffet line?  Just throwing ideas out there!  Overall, a good healthy dining experience."}
{"text":"The management of YC's Grill did take the feedback well and offered us another chance to visit them.  The feel was much better compared to our previous experience with them and hope they keep it up! Great food choices, meats, veggies, carbs, sauces..turns out into delicious combinations.   They have earned our business again!"}
{"text":"Lets just say that this place was like home to me for 4 years when I was in COLLEGE. The food is great and if you pack the bowl high enough it will last you for days. Five stars aren't enough. The only negative thing I have to say is, WHY ISN'T THERE A YC'S IN CHICAGO YET?"}
{"text":"Other than paying for to-go bowls, the place is good. The food tastes great. Make sure to ask them to clean the cooking table before cooking your meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  They make eating your veggies fun and easy.  Being veggie, I skip the meat section altogether (which has a good selection by the way) and pile on the cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, and tofu - yum!  Then, there are several types of noodles and a huge spread of sauces, oils, and spices to add as well.  I think it's best to use a separate bowl for your sauce mixing and also make sure to grab a piece of wax paper to help smush your ginormous food pile down while you're loading to maximize space!  A small bowl will run you about $10 and a large, $11 for lunch - prices jump up about $2 for dinner.  Your meal also includes soups, wontons, rice, and a drink.  I think they may also have an unlimited option - which scares me a little bit!  :/  Pretty good deal considering I always leave stuffed after eating just the small-sized bowl!  One after thought I had was that this place might be problematic for people who have food allergies (poultry, peanuts, shellfish, etc.), as all the food is prepared on one of two large grills - which they don't really clean between customers.  Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"This was not my first time at a YC's restaurant but my first time at this one.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, even offering to make my sauce for me.  Food was delicious (cuz I picked it) and was cooked perfectly.  The restaurant was clean and well kept.  My wife and I are already talking about coming back."}
{"text":"This place really isn't bad. It just isn't great. If are going to go to any kind of chain restaurant then YC's is probably a good choice. You get to pick your raw ingredients and they cook em up for you right there. The food tasted pretty good but as far as the quality of the raw ingredients I wasn't very impressed.   I actually would recommend this place for someone looking for a very fast meal (since the wait time is close to zero), and it's true that it's healthier than a burger joint, but I guess my bar for \"healthy food\" is just much higher than this place."}
{"text":"We went around 830 pm on a Friday evening, Ordered the Unlimited. So Go up for 2nd serving don't finish it all. Ask for a 2 go box they tell me NO. WTH I Paid The Extra. I feel this should be disclosed before paying for extra."}
{"text":"There are a lot of reviews of YCs and they seem to be pretty accurate but I will throw my opinion into the mix. YCs is a really fun place. All of the employees seem to really like working there and they are always exceptionally friendly.   The food portions are enormous if you pack it down into your bowl (I recommend doing son). Get a small bowl on the side for your sauce (you don't have to fit that into your mess of veggies and meat)! and that makes everything a lot easier.  As for flavor I think it's pretty good. I don't recommend going off in your own direction on the sauce, follow their recipes. Every time I've done one on my own it hasn't been as good.  If you like this concept though and want more for taste then go to Genghis Grill. The portion is slightly smaller but the taste is much better."}
{"text":"This place was great! You get to pick whatever you want to, throw it in a bowl and create your own sauce for it to be cooked in. Perfect for picky eaters! When you place your order get to go boxes as there is a 15 cent charge for these and if you are getting a large you will have leftovers (even the husband did). All of the ingredients were super fresh and there were a lot of options. There were two friendly ladies that came out and helped my daughter and I make our sauces based off of the recipes on the wall, but you are more than welcome to create your own. This is a great, quick dinner option for a busy family that is really hungry and looking for leftovers. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's a build-your-own type of place. You get a bowl and add your choice of meat, vegetables, noodles, and sauce. You can stack it as high as you want to. For two large bowls it was $24. It came with two drinks, two servings of wontons, and two soups. Can't wait to go back! I did take off one star because they carry Pepsi products instead of Coke."}
{"text":"Love this place! Loads of choices, fresh veggies, very kind helpful workers and clean place :) would recommend can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"One of my friends took my to YC's years ago during my time at ASU. I was skeptical and scared to try something new. Since then this has remained one of my favorite places to eat.  The place looks very confusing to new comers, so it's always good to go with a YC's veteran to show you the ropes. :) Take as much meat as you want, as much veggies, noodles and then it's up to you to make your own mixture of saucy goodness before handing it over to the good people that man the frying station. They have a plethora of great ingredients to make a delicious sauce for your stir fry. Ginger, Orange, Garlic, Sweet and Sour, and lots others. Above the cooking stations are steps to make different styles of sauce, but I always like going with my instincts and making my own. It's just more fun.   They also have soup, chinese noodles and white, brown rice to go with your meal and a drink comes with the cost. Love that.   I always leave full and usually have lots leftover to bring home. Its fun to get creative with your food here, watch it being cooked, and loving how it tastes. All for a great price. I can't say enough great things about YCs."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Kinda pricy for the amount of food you get, but it is enjoyable. I'd definitely recommend this for somebody looking to get some freshly made mongolian style food! you mix your whole meal yourself and the cook will stir fry for you."}
{"text":"$12.50 includes meal one time thru, soup, rice, drink, ice cream, to go carton. Delicious, well worth the dollar to value ratio."}
{"text":"First time here and first time at a mongolian grill period.....nice experience.....staff is so helpful and attentive from the moment that you walk through their doors up until you leave....they did great at making our first experience pretty dang good....you pac what u want how high u want it and if u don't have enough of meat they will let u know to fill it up to the rim..... if u don't know what kind of sauce u want u got a staff member  down there to make life a lil bit easier lol....no but seriously this place is great....will be coming back indeed!!!!! it's located back by Home depot I almost missed it....clean, Great customer Service and I'm a very happy customer!!!!! See u all later!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't really hype about YC's. It's good, and I'll hand them that, but it's not a 4-5 star place you should take a date. It's build your own meal and have some hispanic men with sticks toss it around a hot circle.   The meat is so thinly shaven that once it cooks down it's like digging through to find a needle in a hay stack to find it. They do have TOFU for all you veggie heads out there, but I wouldn't trust the grill they toss it around on. It's not like they clean it after every use. Plus who knows what's in the sauces.  The noodles you can load on like no other. As you stand in line, you will see people building their food dome. Pretty self explanatory.  The noodles are awesome thick chewy. -Definitely- ask for a to-go box upon ordering, unless you really think you can finish that mother load of carbs. This stuff is better as leftovers anyway. Way worth the 50 cents.   Soup is just okay, but you gotta love those addictive fried won-tons. I love grease. You can feel the grease smash back out of them when you bite into the crispy shell. Again, you can get as many as you want. Same with a bucket of brown and white rice they have for serve.  During dinner hours they allow you to have free self serve/soft serve frozen yogurt from their machines. The cones are junk. Nasty cardboard like cones, and the frozen yogurt is VERY \"so so\". Not worth it if you ask me.   Even though they have tons of great perks, it's still just a place to get stuffed on cheap food. Lunch $8, Dinner $10."}
{"text":"Never ate at a mongolian place before and its okay for fast food. You can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you want and the bowls hold a lot more food then you would think. But in the end everything is super salty (even the soups at the end, just salt ridden) and your not always sure what sauces/flavors would go with what you just put into your bowl. Staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Well it's my first time trying this place. hubby has always been mentioning to how he wants to bring me to this place one day. So, finally I get to try it!  I like the concept of grab how many that you can LOL :-D it's fun to just put how many you want in your plate or should I say bowl! haha. So you get to choose what you want for your stir fry- they have all kinds of meat, beef, chicken, pork..and they have cod fish too which is good!  So what I did was, I put all but beef haha!   and of course there's different veggies to throw in. You get to choose the kind of sauce you want..I like mine super spicy!  and the last part is for them to cook it for you which is so much fun to watch watch. Hubby went crazy and over loaded his bowl and when the time for them to cook it, they ended up having to grab 2 bowls soon as they're done cooking for him! haha Yeah, he's not very hungry that time LOL ^_^ I also like the unlimited rice,soups, drinks and frozen yogurt. We really had a great dinner here and we are surely coming back again! Highly recommended! Come here and give it try and you'll surely love it!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place and so I get \"invited\" to go to lunch with them when they are a bit empty pocketed- gotta love high schoolers!  This is not the only reason I find myself frequenting this location.  Among some of the many reasons I like YC's Mongolian Grill include the plethora of choices you have to make your meal completely unique each and every time you visit.  As they say- \"How to Mongo\" is completely up to you!   Feeling beefy- go with the beef which I dare say are fairly good cuts of meat.  You might try the chicken offered in both dark and white.  Whether your hankering be meaty or not, there is something for everyone...noodle, rice, fish etc. as well as a selection of more than 20 veggies!  A bit of a control freak- then this is the place for you. Fill your bowl up to your desired taste- did I say fill your bowl up?  Let me emphasis - FILL YOUR BOWL UP! One of my favorite things about the mongo line is seeing how high one can stuff a bowl.  Regulars know that the food \"shrinks to fit\" once cooked and the goal is, of course, to get as much into the bowl as possible.  YC's could make this a contest or Ripleys could add a category as I believe there is a seasoned skill to getting this just right to maximize the final outcome.    Once your bowl can take no more, head to the sauces section and choose from the many pre made sauce menus or be a daredevil and create your own.  I typically go with the Chef's Favorite which is a pleasing mixture of soy, teriyaki, sweet and sour and a splash of garlic and ginger.    Once through the line \"wok\" it on over to the guys that cook it all up on the hot grill using only water and the sauces that you added to your bowl.  Can you smell this tasty goodness yet?    Found that your eyes were bigger than your stomach- no worries, for .50 cents you can grab a to go box and enjoy your feast from home.  There are several bowl prices to pick from including and starting with $10.85 for a small and goes up from there to large and unlimited... I believe the to go box is a no go when dining with the unlimited option, for obvious reasons.    If you still have room you might grab a non-fat frozen yogurt for $1.00 as your heading out the door.    This location has always been well maintained, clean and the employees are always pleasant.  All in all- a fun, filling and delish experience!"}
{"text":"This was actually my first time trying Mongolian BBQ in an actual restaurant. I've had it before at the food court in the mall and I usually love it because the flavors were always right. They have a good variety of meat, I wish they had more options for fish though! The veggies were also good, great variety. I'm a light eater so I had more veggies than meat and more fish. What got me was selecting my sauces! Too many to choose from and I had no clue what to add haha. Service was good, we had a young gentlemen check up on us which was nice because not every restaurant has a manager do that. (FYI that is a huge factor in the restaurant industry, a manager should always check on every table at least once!) But overall I had a pleasant experience here and I would definitely be back because the food was absolutely delicious, the portions, well that's really up to you on how much you shove in your bowl haha and it wasn't expensive at all! 25 dollars for two of us! You Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Its been a while since I've had barbecued Mongolians.   Staff was very helpful.  Food was ok.  Like every other mongolian restaurant I've been to, regardless of how much sauce you put on the food most of it boils off and imparts very little flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious Mongolian BBQ. I've been to many different Mongolian barbecue places over the years and YCs is excellent. Great choices of meats, noodles, and sauces. And the all-you-can-eat side dishes are awesome as well, even the ice cream is great."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZE!! Low key, fast, tasty, and lots of choices.  I usually pile on more meat than veggies and tend to go for the thai chili sauce. WHOA!! If it's your first time there and you have leftovers don't forget to tell the waitress that your new and she will give you the doggie box for free.   I also love that they serve BROWN rice.  Not a lot of asian places do so thanks for that  Mr. YC!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location of YC's in about 15 years, but I stopped in today for lunch with my kiddo and Papa.  Kids are charged 55 cents x their age for a kid-sized bowl.  Adults are charged  $9.50 for a small bowl or $10.50 for a large bowl.  We opted for large bowls to ensure we had leftovers.  The price of the meal includes soft drinks.  They normally charge 50 cents per takeout container, but they waived the fee since we hadn't been there in such a long time.  They also charge you $1 for soft serve, which my daughter insisted on having after her meal.  The hostess was extremely helpful in getting us set up.  She gave us some wax paper to push down the ingredients and encouraged us to pack our bowls as much as possible.  Then she came back and even made our sauces for us.  We must have looked helpless, but it was fine with me.  I appreciated the help!  Then she came by to ask if my food was spicy enough, since I had indicated I liked food spicy.  It wasn't (but I was resolved to accept it), so she brought me some hot chili pepper sauce in a cup; that did the trick.    The food was pretty good.  Best of all, it was a great price.  I like this location of YC's slightly better than the Elliott location.  I think the personal service made such a big difference.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm such a huge fan of food customization and this place is right up my alley.  No one is going to put gross things on my plate if I don't want them and I don't have to ask for any sort of special order.  I can load up on the broccoli and carrots and don't get charged extra.  When we came in there was a very friendly and helpful girl at the register who was happy to explain the process to us, at which point the husband looked overwhelmed and disgusted.  In any event, I had lots of fun making my own special dish and creating a magical sauce that tantalized my tastebuds.  I will definitely come back, it's just a matter of getting a certain someone to agree."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch.  We were immediately helped by Paco who, based on what I overheard him say about working at all the YCs, is the manager.  Paco you did a great job my friend.  I can't tell you the last time I had such great service .  And it was from the whole staff.  He actually came over and assisted my wife in making the sauce for her dish.  I should have let him help me with mine.  We shall definitely be back."}
{"text":"Location: it is located in the same plaza as the movie theater with plenty of parking. The restaurant is very spacious with lots of tables. General area is relatively clean. The only draw back is the place is bit stuffy due to poor ventilation. Even though it is cold in the outside, I started sweating 15 minutes sitting in the inside.   Service: all staffs are super friendly. They even came around cleaning up the table for us shortly after we were done. Cashier seems new and unorganized. At times, I saw people standing for 2 minutes and she was no where to be found. When she saw someone standing there, she ran to the cashier and started apologizing. Some training is definitely needed. Cooks work quickly and efficiency. Another staff came up and help us making the sauce. It was absolutely delicious.   Food: for approx $13 + tax, you will get a large bowl to stack up the food for as high as you could, a small soup/rice and a large soda. If you know you cannot finish your meal, pay 50 cents for a To-Go-Box for the leftover. I love their food, but the soup was a bit tasteless.  Rating: I enjoy their food and will come back here again. Hopefully they will fix the ventilation system."}
{"text":"Today me, my sister, brother, and mom came to YC's for her Mother's Day lunch and it was amazing! I've never had it before, and I was pleasantly surprised!! There are so many selections of delicious meats and fresh veggies I was in heaven. The staff was so friendly and the service was great! The portions are huge and the soup bar is all you can eat and so yummy! I highly recommend this restaurant and especially this location."}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars for this place. Whenever I visit Phoenix nowadays, this is a must go place!  The secret is a few scoops of curry sauce, few scoops of spicy thai, a dollop of garlic, a whole lot of dry pepper flakes, loads of veggies and a request to make it very well done....this place makes a mean stir fry!! I love it!! love it!! The problem is that I over eat and I am too sleepy to work afterwards."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of YC's since day one. I'm the person who annoys everyone else in line because I make a massive pile of veggies and noodles and take forever in doing so - but what can I say? I'm allowed to put on as much as I want, I'm paying for it, so dang it all, I am bound and determined to get two days of leftovers from it all! There's only really a handful of things that I don't like about this place. You pay for the to-go boxes always seems cheap to me. I'm also peeved that the ice cream machine is only open at certain times, silly as that sounds. Since I pay the same whenever I go there, I think it's kind of cheap to only have it open for dinner. I mean really, is that icy milk machine rreeeally breaking the bank? I doubt it. Other than that, love it here. Always get amazing flavors and good quality food."}
