{"text":"This place is just a Filibertos knockoff with worse food and horribly unclean kitchen and dining area."}
{"text":"It's okay. It's a stomach filler. It is no  filibertos but it will fill the void. I had the carna Asada burrito and super nachos. I honestly don't know if I will ever go back unless I'm real hungry."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other 3 star reviews. Not that clean and not quite as tasty as Filbertos, some meals are pretty good. I like seeing the kids help with the family biz... I will support that and their low prices."}
{"text":"Quick service, big portions, and the specials are justifiably special in regards to overall value (especially the chicken tacos)."}
{"text":"50/50 - if the owner is there the food is perfect - when her families their in her place it's a hit or miss. The interior needs a face lift - it's a hole in the wall and looks pretty unsanitary."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when they would not let me use my $10 Restaurant.com gift card for the full value and would only let me use it for half it's value. I did not get a chance to try the food, since I cancelled my order after that. I was looking forward to trying it out, but will be taking my business elsewhere in future."}
{"text":"Best Mexican joint I've found in Gilbert area. Top notch carne asada burritos and reasonable prices. Try their super nachos. They weigh like eight pounds."}
{"text":"This has to be the filthiest restaruant in Gilbert. Got food to go. 15 yr old kid at counter mumbled 2 words and got annnoyed when I asked for more salsa. Carne asada burrito was a notch below filibertos and way more greasy. I guess if you live close and need a taco shop fix, this is the place."}
{"text":"Place was decent.  My order was to go. I had a torta and chile rellenos. I would definitely give it another shot. They could use a new cashier though."}
{"text":"Complete dump.  See earlier post about leftover pickup stix furniture.  Tacos weren't bad, but I hope the reviews saying they are closed are true.  Nobody spoke English, even for phone orders.  Completely sketchy.  Too bad, they could have cornered the dive Mexican food market in this little community.  Save your time and money."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good. Not sure if they turned over their staff, but the service has been atrocious lately. Twice in a row our order came out incorrect. Seriously? You're making tacos. If Taco Bell can get it right, why can't you? We'll give it one more shot, but if they screw up again, we're done. Lots of Mexican places out there."}
{"text":"Awful, I ordered quesadilla yesterday for lunch, and this morning I'm writing this review while diarrhea in the restroom"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Took 5 minutes just to be recognized that we were waiting to order. One person working on a Sunday. Waited 35 minutes for our food. Was served with no napkins. When tried to ask for some the guy working was no where to be found. Water machine disgusting and there was no ice in the soda machine. While eating a previous customer came to get a refund. Her burrito tortilla she said was hard. She warned us all to check out food before we ate. When ordering they were out of chicken. The guy working serves us our food after the long wait with headphones in his ear and you could hear the rap music he was listening to as he put our food on our table. Unfortunately it's hard to be mad because the food was actually good. It wasn't that good to forget about this experience so we will never be back."}
{"text":"I got so tired of waiting for my  food with three kids in tow that I decided never to come back here again. Too slow. We waited for an hour. I had a cranky 8 year old kid on my hands."}
{"text":"We just started coming here a few months ago. As a vegetarian, there is only one thing on the menu I can eat. Potato tacos! They are always $1 and delicious.   The interior leaves much to be desired, but we usually get it to go."}
{"text":"We just moved here from So. Cali and we decided to give this place a shot. I am a VERY picky when it comes to mexican food and so is my family and this place hit the spot and it's right around the corner. They have a new customer :-)"}
{"text":"Decent, quick Mexican food. Nothing fancy but I like the Taco Tuesday deal."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Most people would walk out when they see the inside but that's what authentic food places are like. I recommend them!!!"}
{"text":"I got my car worked on and this place was within walking distance so tried it. I agree with both Titus and Steven on this one. Food was good and the place is not fancy."}
{"text":"Have been a long time customer and have never had a problem until recently. Food orders have been taken and wrong orders received. Long waits only to find out when you get home the order isn't right.  Usually love this place but it seems to be going downhill with current staff :("}
{"text":"I'm so excited to find this place! I grew up in Oxnard, CA where the Mexican food is straight outta Mexico and you can find great authentic food on practically every corner.  So I'm happy to report that this place has awesome beans and rice (so many places make such bland beans) and wonderfully seasoned food.  I've only been here once so that's why I'm not giving them 5 stars yet, I'll report back after my next visit.  OH and I'm an avid chorizo breakfast burrito lover and theirs is delicious! They put potatoes in there (can't go wrong with potatoes) and I requested that beans be added in = YUMMY!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a taco, this is the place to tame the hunger!"}
{"text":"Some times this place is a step above Filibertos and some days it is a small step below. Essentially the same menu. We used to LOVE their tacos (I would get chicken and my husband beef), but they are too inconsistent, so I think we kind of gave up on them after a few not so great times in a row.   They are the closest cheap Mexican takeout for us, so we end up grabbing something every other or every third week, but not something to go out of the way for."}
{"text":"Average for an inexpensive Mexican food. Kind of like Filibertos. Service was decent, nothing note worthy. Food - ditto (rolled tacos). As a hater of onions I'm thankful for \"traditional\" guac at these types if spots that don't have onions I it. Woot woot!  Give them a whirl. It's fast, cheap and not bad"}
{"text":"I LOVE their carne asada taco plate!  I'm not sure how other reviewers compare the food to Filiberto's as it's nowhere near as greasy and the rice and beans are so much better.  They do however have the same menu and atmosphere.  This is a take-out place, where I order my food, run to Walgreens, and pick it up 5-10 minutes later.  If you're going to worry about a Mexican joint being super clean and well-decorated, go to Abuelos."}
{"text":"I gave their carne asada burrito experience a try... Couldn't even finish half of it, because it was so gross."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are the best and they have the best salsas! The burritos are stuffed and the tortillas fresh."}
{"text":"Yuck!!!! Food was nasty Restaurant wasn't clean at all ...not a single table wasn't left with food particles...and no one was in there.  They are too lazy too clean.  If you paid for my food I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Phoenix area and ate lunch at Los Rubios.  It was OK.  I was looking for authentic tacos.   I ate the asada and carnitas.  They were larger than street tacos with pico de gallo and guac.  The salsa was not very hot (disappointing).  It was in a tiny plastic container.  I needed to ask for more.  Overall flavor was OK.  I did like the roasted serrano chile.  It added the heat I was looking for.  The tables all needed cleaning when I arrived.  It was about 2:30 p.m., so this may reflect the post lunch condition.  The next time I visit, I will likely try a different place."}
{"text":"Good food but saw three roaches while eating. Totally grossed me because clearly there is an infestation."}
{"text":"The first time I went there a couple of years ago, it was pretty good.  Then I went there a year ago and it was ok.  Went again tonight and in my opinion, it was some of the worst  food I have ever had.     Like others have said, very inconsistent but either way, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"New name / New owner - Doesn't have a same taste like before. one of the worst customer service from owner.  Use to have Cana sada Taco"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place at all, service was good and food came up quick.  We had to turn down the volume on the tv with the mexican soaps blaring but all good.  I'd say it's setup and the menu is quite like any of the *bertos around town but I had the #26 Pollo Asada plate... VERY good... typical beans/rice and peppers... came with one big Jalapeño and then green peppers in with the chicken and a big hot flour torilla.  Nothing special but good food.  Also very clean inside...  And it says they're open 24 hours.... THAT may come in handy some night :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for about 6 months now.. I have noticed at times they can be inconsistent with their food and quality. The staff seems to be mostly family which is nice and the owner lady is very nice as well. There have been times I would give this place 5 stars and times I would give 1. Wish it wasn't like that. Taco Tuesdays are probably the best day to go. The interior is not exactly pleasant, which is strange because there is a paint store right next door!! If your thinking about going here I hope your a gambling person who likes a 50/50 chance on a good visit!"}
{"text":"the other reviews for this place are all over the map. I came here on a recommendation and yep, it's pretty much like a filibertos. it was basically the same thing. I had a cheese enchilada, a shredded beef burrito and rice and beans. it was super deelish. the guy at the counter was super nice. just like all the other filibertos I've been to, the seating is kinda shabby, and I chuckle when there is a TV on the wall with some weird Latin game show or soap opera. but hey, that's part of the experience, so I love it. I grew up here in AZ, and can't stand most of the Mexican places in the Phoenix metro because they either try to be trendy or they try to reinvent Mexican food like they do in California. this place just as much as filibertos, really is authentic Mexican food from this region. so I don't really know what other people think is *authentic,* but until you've been a hole in the wall sort of joint like this, you don't know what real Mexican food is, IMO. I'll try it again, for sure."}
{"text":"More consistent then most little Mexican joints around here. Cheaper than a filibertos. Their tacos are very good. They are .99¢ Tuesdays and it is always busy. I always have the carne asada or a cheese quesidilla and they never let me down.   They can tens to be a little bit slow but overall the Service is good and so is their food."}
{"text":"I found a rock in my food. A rock.  The woman said it came from the beans and gave me my money back. She was very kind about it and she said it came from the beans. The food was alright otherwise. The breakfast burrito potatoes were not good but on the other hand the tortillas were deeeelicious!  I might be back one drunken night but the rock kind of killed it for me."}
{"text":"I went to eat twice the first time the food was good but it was really dirty, the second time was today. I ate half the burrito it was pretty good but I couldn't stop thinking about the roach that I saw crawling on the wall and floor and I just couldn't eat anymore."}
{"text":"DIRTY DINING!  Several BAD report cards with Maricopa County and an on going problem since December, 2013. See for yourself:  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-19251&business=Los%20Rubios&address=2473%20S%20Higley%20Rd%20Suite%20103"}
{"text":"Always had good, fresh food and friendly service. Their chicken tacos are some of the best I have ever had, and I will always be a customer because one time I ordered but had lost my debit card, and they still fed me and just told  me to come back the next day and pay. There are not many resteraunts or businesses that will do that anymore, and I was impressed.  They also make a pretty good torta and the carne asada is pretty good.   Cheap, fast, and yummy...."}
{"text":"Slightly above Filiberto's. No drive thru but parking is easy and the wait is never long. The menu is also similar to Filiberto's, but for me that is not a bad thing. Their green sauce is better also. This is family owned and staffed. In fact, I've heard the family lives in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here. Unfortunately the staff speaks little English. For example, today I called in an order for two potato tacos and a quesadilla (I know junk vegetarian at best) and I arrived almost 15 minutes later. They were not ready. I had to reorder them because they never got ordered.  I ordered in Spanish, but I had started in English so she didn't ask my name, and must not have actually taken my order. It's frustrating because I've now waited an additional 10 minutes and it's still not ready. Don't get me wrong, they are busy on Tuesdays, and I'll still eat here again, but this is not the first time I've waited an unbelievable amount of time for food.   If I was rating food alone, I'd give closer to 4-stars, but not quite."}
{"text":"Update 07/14   Still my favorite place, and they have even drastically improved their appearance. Good lookin seats, repainted and even new bold signage out front. It's still not the Ritz of dining rooms but I gave an extra star for the improvements."}
{"text":"Great local mexican place if you're out and about in Gilbert, and their Taco Tuesday is the best I've found..."}
{"text":"Here is AZ we find it difficult to find authentic Mexican food, those types of place that look like they are going out of business but the line to place your order is at least  a 10 minute wait.  But you know the food is worth it.  This is one of those places, the food is authentic not fast food or Chipotle style food, real Mexican food.  The portions are generous and the menu is massive, they also serve breakfast all day.  So if you are tired of Taco Bell, Chipotle, and the other places that try to make Mexican food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.  Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions."}
{"text":"Very similar to Filiberto's. Very small location with picture menu featuring all their combos...you know the usual suspects... 2 tacos w/rice n beans, or 1 enchilada with taco and rice n beans...get it? one downfall is that they don't have a salsa bar. If you want salsa you can grab some pre-packed lil containers of red salsa they have in this little fridge, but it's not the best. I prefer places with salsa bars where you can get jalepenos and carrots and a variety of salsas. Anyways, my hubby got the carne asada fries which were really good (how can you F#$% this up?) and I got a combo of cheese enchilada and bean tostada. The rice and beans beat Filibertos hands down, but the enchilada wasn't anything spectacular. This place is ok and I'll go back since it's right up the road from my casa."}
{"text":"I just finished having lunch here and I liked everything just fine. I had the #5 combo which is a taco and an enchilada, both chicken, with a medium Tamarindo drink. Good flavor, friendly staff. If you want to get the same meal and pay an extra five bucks for a schmoozy atmosphere, go somewhere else. But I would go here again any day."}
{"text":"This isn't fine dining folks, but I do love the food! I get my food to go because the seating and tables are scary. They have Pick Up Stix chairs.  I love Taco Tuesdays! It's a notch below Los Faves and Filib's, but still pretty good."}
{"text":"It took a couple recommendations to get me to stop. Tucked in a strip mall, it's easy to overlook. However, I have to say the chicken taco plate rivals any of my fave hole in the wall Mexican places. The interior is a blend of repurposed Pick Up Stix chairs and a giant photo menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. The prices are super affordable, and the service was pleasant. I was in a rush and opted for takeout. They forgot my side of guac, but the flavor of the marinated chicken more than made up for it. I intend to swing in for breakfast and definitely for my next taco fix."}
{"text":"Worst experience tonight. Did not listen when the young man was working there to take my order. I asked for more than heard. Also he forgot another mans order, that was there 4 people before me( he got his money back) then he gave me my food with no bag and gave me my hot sauce in my hand. I asked for a bag and he said that they were to small for my food.. WTF.."}
{"text":"It's pretty much Filiberto's twin. All the same food-fare, but it seemed to have a more local family business feel to it. The food was decent, but nothing exceptional. If you're looking for cheap Mexican food and don't want fake-Mexican Taco Bell, then go here!"}
