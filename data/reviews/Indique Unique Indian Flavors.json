{"text":"Food was pretty good, but certainly not amazing. Pricier entr√©es than most other places ($14.50+ for most non-vegetarian dishes) and not as good as many other places. The plates provided were dirty (old food caked on, and a small speck of fresh food too), and when we exchanged one, we received an equally dirty plate. Not a huge issue, but still off-putting. The stuffed naan had very little filling. The butter chicken was good, but didn't come with rice or bread (pretty unusual in my experience - especially for the price). Service was average."}
{"text":"Avoid this place, they are dishonest  We bought a Groupon and paid the premium price so it would be valid any night of the week, including Friday. We went to this restaurant for dinner on a Friday night. Only one table was occupied and there was only table reserved. We were able to get a table until he found out we wanted to use a Groupon. We pointed out that he had lots of empty tables, but he told us they were too busy. Funny how he had a table available until he found out we had a Groupon. This is a scam, we had paid extra so we could eat any night, but he won't honor the deal."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is pretty mediocre at best. If you're not in a rush (for dine in, pick or delivery) and you don't mind the wait, the food is delicious"}
{"text":"I've never actually been inside this building so I can't comment on wether or not they are running an illegal baccarat ring, but I have ordered their food on Skip The Dishes and I can say it's super delicious and the portions are amazing. I always feel so savvy when I order because I know one order of food will feed me for two meals, then I think about how yummy it is and end up ordering two entrees anyways. Sometimes I'm not even in the mood for Indian food but I like to stalk (on Skip the Dishes, calm down) the courier as he delivers it to me. It gives me a feeling of power that quenches my god complex about as well as the actual food quenches my hunger."}
{"text":"Ordered via Skip the dishes. Very fast delivery, huge portions, great flavours, good business to support."}
