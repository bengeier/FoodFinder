{"text":"Food was weak and overpriced. The risotto was like soup and the sangria was made with canned fruit."}
{"text":"I visited Sambuca with my mom. We both enjoyed the experience overall. Each of us had pasta dishes, mine being the Congambare with tiger shrimp. The portions were generous and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. As for the service, the server was friendly and hospitable. My only criticism of Sambuca would be their drinks: the martinis we ordered didn't have much flavour and they weren't blended quite enough. 

 I'll definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"this is one of my favourite restaurants in the baldwin village and one of my favourite places for weekend brunch. brunch isn't listed on their website, but i believe it's 11am -3pm for saturday and sunday, and is pretty reasonably.  i usually get the steak and eggs for brunch and their seafood risotto for dinner if they're offering it as one of their specials.  superb!  friendly staff. cosy atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch and I have to say the food is pretty average. My meal was a bit too salty. It is a clean place with nice ambiance and good service. The prices are average to high as well."}
{"text":"I've been to sambuca twice for dinner and both times I split the $25 prix-fixe with a friend. The waitress was very nice about it, but I felt a little guilty because other than my table there was only one other diner. However, the servings are really big and plenty for two hungry females. We had the mussels, which were delicious and piled high in an addictive sauce, the steak (med-rare), which was big and juicy and paired with mashed potatoes and veggies on the side, and the creme brulee, which was in a big dish instead of the usual ramekin. 
Another time, I've been here for lunch. I sat out in the patio and ordered a mango mimosa and a salad. The salad was gigantic and I remember struggling to finish it. I can't remember what kind of salad it was though. 
I would recommend this restaurant for the great food and large portions. However, being on a student budget, I would probably go with a friend and split a meal again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot. The atmosphere is cozy and the food is always fantastic. They even make some of their pasta dishes gluten free which is a plus. They have a fixed price menu year round that is a great value. Great place for date night!"}
{"text":"Came here again recently for my friend's birthday! My group of 8 came here on a Saturday and we all got the $25 price-fixed menu (they even let two of us split the meal!)

Ambiance was nice, servers were attentive and friendly and they even allowed me to drop off a cake for my friend ahead of time to surprise her during our meal. Everyone's food was great and again the portions were huge! 

Personally I think it's more worth it to come for the price-fixed menu than for lunch, that way you get a taste of everything on the menu for a good price.

Regardless of what others say, I still love this place and I look forward to coming back to try the brunch one day!

P.s. After the birthday dinner, because of the giant portions we ALL had food babies"}
{"text":"Fixed price menu (Prix-fixe) was the bomb.  It's a 3 course menu for $25 and it's the best value for dollar for oppressed millionaires.  Otherwise this place pretty much sucks monkey balls if you get any singular item off the menu.

Appetizers: Mussels.... or should I say a bucket of mussels.  I've been to the restaurant beside this place and ordered mussels before - this place gives you almost 2 times more and tastes fresher than wearing axe body spray.

Main: Veal chop; medium rare.  This shit was the bomb.  It was like unicorns bitch slapped my face with flavour and rainbows popped out.  Charred on the outside, soft like cotton candy on the inside.  

tartufo: Mmmmm tofu...Nope, not tofu! It's actually one of the best god damn icecream I've ever eaten!

Service was regular.  But add in unlimited free toasted/warm bread changes it to an A+ would go again."}
{"text":"I've been to Sambuca plenty of times and I think that it's an okay restaurant since my experience here is usually a hit or miss. The food is generally good but the dishes are not always consistent! A couple of times my food was undercooked. I must note that when you bring this problem to the attention of the servers, they are more than happy to remake the dish. Just make it right in the first place! My experience would have been so much better that way.

When the food is made right, it's fantastic! The dishes are delicious, satisfying, and the potions are good too. The place is clean and the desserts are very yummy, especially their tiramisu- the best I've ever had! The prices are reasonable for some dishes, but they're some other dishes that are very simple and costly at the same time. 

The service at Sambuca is always excellent and super friendly. The décor in the restaurant is cozy and nice, and their patio always makes people happy. 

Overall, Sambuca is an okay restaurant."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Wednesday.

Would I return?  Probably not.

We came here after standing next to Valens because we both have been and wanted to try something new.  As luck would have it, there was a office party here for secret santa and I think that distracted us a bit from the meal itself (but it was awesome to see).

The decor is okay, dimly lit restaurants always confuse me because don't you want your patrons to be able to see their food and each other?  The place is not very large, probably fits roughly 50 people by my guess.  Service was good, greeted, drink orders, asked about our food, etc.

We came for the $25 fixed price menu which is listed on their website, we order the mussels, t-bone steak, jambalaya, tiramisu and cream brulee.  The mussels were nice, had a nice broth to it.  The steak was over done, but even if it wasn't, I'm not sure I would have liked it any better.  The jambalaya is not what I expected since I was thinking it would be closer to a paella but it was just jambalaya contents on a bed of white rice.  Cream brulee was fine, tiramisu I thought was really good though.

All in all, an okay experience but I don't think I'd come back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best surprise in a long time!

While walking down Baldwin Street (in itself a hidden gem and amazing downtown surprise) I came across this cute little Italian restaurant. I was tempted to try it already, and then discovered the three-course for $15 lunch menu! Sold!

I was a bit skeptical about how good my meal would be, as so many places offering these type of deals cheap out on the quality of the final product. However, I needn't have worried. The tuna bruschetta was an interesting twist on the average bruschetta appetiser, and was pretty tasty - perfectly seasoned tuna served on white Italian bread topped with tomatoes. Unfortunately it wasn't perfect - the bread was a bit soggy, not the freshest. Then again, we did visit on a holiday. No fresh deliveries that morning, perhaps? The vegetarian risotto I had for mains was packed full of flavour, with the peppers and mushrooms cooked to perfection. The risotto was a nice consistency, not gloopy and stodgy, but not overly watery either. As with all risotto dishes, it was totally filling and left me feeling that I had definitely got my money's worth. 

The caramelised topping of the crème brulee dessert seemed slightly burned, but other than that, the final course was sufficiently tasty and a perfect way to round off our unexpected lunch on Baldwin.

The service was fantastic. Our server was genuine, friendly, speedy and made us feel very welcome even though her shift was soon to finish.

I'd definitely return here. I don't know anywhere else in Toronto where you could get such a cheap three-course lunch with the quality of food, nice ambience and excellent service on offer here."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, that I also love to go there by myself to enjoy a great meal. Their prices are great, and if you're a salad fan, they have salmon salad & tiger shrimp salad for only 12-13 $, while its a big portion! 
I went there for the first time and had the pesto with lemon cream sauce, and wow, the salmon was grilled to perfection, and the plating was pretty as well. I'll always come back, service is amazing, food is great, the sitting is cozy... and I found out the owner is the chef who cooks in the back, which explains the care that is put in each dish."}
{"text":"I had the Tetrazzini.

The patio is lovely, the service is friendly, and the food is quite good.
The tetrazzini featured fresh ingredients and a sauce that appeared to be real cream, the portion was large as well and I thought I might not finish but the dish's deliciousness prevailed."}
{"text":"Pretty average spot. 

Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. 

Service was adequate. 

Is Baldwin street actually good?"}
{"text":"The place was really cool. Ordered polenta fries, magic mushroom and a sambuca pizza. The mushroom was good. Both the pizza and fries were okay(wasnt very impressed). Three stars is for the ambience and service."}
{"text":"We went to Valens for Winterlicious. Although we made our reservations a month in advance they made us wait at the door (where it was absolutely freezing) for quite sometime till they figured out the seating arrangement. Once seated, we couldn't even take our coats off. Felt like we were seated in a refrigerator, the heating was on low. I looked around the restaurant and everyone was bundled up and shivering. Finally someone complained I think, so they turned the heat up. 

For starters we ordered mussels and carpaccio. Mussels were good, but the bread they gave us to soak up the broth was stale and cold. The carpaccio was a little chewy, very average. For the main course we wanted to order the lamb shank but they only had one left. So I ordered the veal, my cousins ordered the steak, seafood fettuccini and one lamb shank. Thank the lord for that because the lamb shank turned out to be the worst of the lot. It had a strong smell and wasn't close to melting off the bones. My veal was ok but the mashed potatoes were heavy and clumped up like glue.

Turned off by the main course, we were quite skeptical about the dessert. However that turned out to be the best part of the meal. We ordered the creme brulee and the banana cake. The creme brulee was delicious and the portion was large (not in the usual sized ramekin). The banana cake was moist and flavourful. I could actually taste the real banana pieces.

Overall I'd say if the dessert wasn't good I think I'd give this place a rating of 1 star. But the dessert made an impact on me so based on that I'm giving it a two."}
{"text":"Sambuca is a so-so restaurant.  I have been there a few times, and I have noticed that the food in terms of quality is really inconsistent. Although some of their dishes are good, they can be overpriced for the amount of food that they give you. One time I was there I could barely choke down my food it was so disgusting! However, the other few times I was there it was okay, but it still tasted as if an amateur cook had prepared it. It really depends on what you order.  I must also add that I find the desserts somewhat overpriced.

The service when I was there was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere was also quite relaxing and enjoyable. Nevertheless, I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here and many lunches and dinners. Definitely recommend their salmon salad and their variety of pastas. The food is reliably good every time. On one occasion, they took a very long time during a lunch, but all was forgiven because it was so good."}
{"text":"Visited on a great summer night and sat outside on the patio - almost felt like I was back in Europe.  Had a wonderful atmosphere (but Baldwin IS a great street after all).  I ordered from their specials menu - I had a greek salad with salmon.  I thought the fish was perfectly cooked and was surprised to find that salmon could compliment a greek salad.  My friends had pasta and found it to be light and not overpowering or heavy at all.  Greek salad is my go-to staple restaurant food and although this one did impress, I prefer a classic greek salad with more olives, feta and tomatoes.  Will return for pasta on a nice summer night and a drink or two."}
{"text":"When I first when to this place, I couldn't find it. I thought I went to the wrong street but I checked the address and my map location and apparently it was supposed to be in front of me. What I saw was Valens restaurant and wondered if the place had closed down without notice. Apparently it's the same place but called two different names?  Anyway, I wasted about 20 mins bc of the name discrepancy.

The service, food and atmosphere was great. Water is always being refilled, and food was brought to our table in a timely manner. Although it's a rather small place, a reservation should do the job--we had 20 people come for our reservation!

There's quite a selection to choose from. It's also vegetarian and vegan friendly. It was nice to hear them clarify whether the vegetarian dish was to be made vegan.

I liked the bread they served at the beginning. It was very soft and not chewy at all! For my main meal, I got the frutti de mare. For the price, the portion was fair. I love seafood, so I quite enjoyed the dish. Sometimes there's too much tomato taste at other places, but the seasoning and sauce was done wonderfully here.

Overall, the food is good. The place is hard to find, but it all worked out in the end. :p"}
{"text":"i LOVE this place.  Been here a bunch of time but every single time i eat the same thing. Peperonata panini (grilled eggplant, zucchini, roasted onion, red peppers, asiago cheese and pesto mayo).  It comes with a side of their mista salad which has a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The dressing is SO good, it has a slight sweetness to it and its thicker than just regular balsamic.  The bread is good, the grilled veggies are great, the whole dish is just fantastic :)

This time I decided to try something different and I got the Tre colore pasta (fusilli tossed with grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, and asparagus in a basil pesto cream sauce).  This was really good! It could've used a bit more of the veggies, but the sauce was great, and the portion size was also perfect.  I need to start trying more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Another Baldwin staple which I always tend to not venture in to because the menu never stood out to me and they tend not to do great (or any) lunch specials which is the main meal I frequent here on Baldwin Village.

The restaurant is sadly mostly empty most times I walk past it (but it's survived for a while now) and their patio is nothing to write home about except for the fact it's a good people watching spot like any patio on Baldwin is. Much like \"Valens\" next to it, Sambuca has a large menu main but concentrates on the Italian side of things and in my experience, large menus tend not to bring out the best in the food. I was right on my assumption with my sweet potato purée appetizer being tasty but nothing special. My \"Atlantico\" pasta entrée was delicious, but the portion was too large (maybe not as a stand alone meal) and they could have done with just a little less sauce. But the salmon was cooked generally well. 

Service was quick and it should have been as we were the only patrons for most of our meal and our server was friendly, no complaints there.

A very mediocre restaurant when you consider it's food, but not a bad experience and prices are while it's not cheap it's in a reasonable range. If you want a relatively quick meal get your Italian fix here, but if you're willing to put up with the slow pace of John's Italian Cafe give it a shot, it's got more of an atmosphere usually."}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by the value and quality of the prix fixe menu. The food was delicious and bountiful, the service was extremely well-mannered and helpful, and the decor was aesthetically pleasing. Have no complaints at all, and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the middle of downtown!
Amazing food for very decent prices!
We got the mussels, lamb, and salmon salad. Super fresh and amazing flavor. Amazing staff as well!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible. If you like bad Italian food, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular enough patron at Sambuca for a number of years. It's been a great place to have a good meal. Sadly, things have changed. My last visit I ordered a pizza from the daily special and asked for no onions. I was assured it wouldn't be a problem. After a considerable wait I was served a pizza with onions on it. I told the waiter and he carried it off to the kitchen. To my dismay, he returned immediately and placed it on the table in front of me. I was told the chef said there were no onions. However, after he must have removed some, there were others still clearly visible. I was floored by the way I was treated. Had to order something else. No serious apology... It will be the last time I visited the place."}
{"text":"3.5

I've had lunch at Sambuca Grill a few times and dinner once. The food is reasonably priced, fresh and made to order. I have ordered the prawn salad and their steak. The salad had a lovely lemon vinaigrette with three prawns. I have ordered their steak and I prefer my steak without sauce drizzled on top of it but I think they provide a gravy which I felt took away from the flavor of the meat. Being dairy intolerant, there were not many options. Something to keep in mind for others out there with the same food insensitivity. The service is wonderful and attentive. The restaurant is fairly small and can get filled quickly, I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"I guess I've been going to a lot more restaurants nowadays and I am expecting more and more as time passes by.  However, Sambuca is still one of the top cheap eats that I like to go to on a nice sunny day after work on the patio.

My friends and I went on Friday evening to have dinner there.  I made reservations for 5 people - and the funny thing was that there wasn't *that* many people there to begin with.  I ordered myself the special (linguini); and my friends ordered the Sambuca pizza, a salad, a panini, and the piccante.  Calamari to share.

The calamari was okay - better than most places that I've been to.  I was quite impressed by my linguine -- can't complain about it.  Large scallops, and great salmon.  No one really had anything to complain about other than my friend who got he piccante - and said it wasnt' spicy enough.

It was definitely a good eat and quite filling.  Can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch event recently.

We ordered the calimari, but it wasn't that good; it tasted like the oil they used was old and not fresh.

I had the pesto pasta, where the sauce was pretty dry and didn't make the dish flavourful.

We had to ask for bread towards the end of the meal because the servers had given bread to all the other tables.  

We ordered wine, but the waitress forgot to put the order in so we had to wait until later on to get our wine order.

I wouldn't go back to this place, it was just ok and not very good.  If you feel like Italian cuisine next time you're at Baldwin, I suggest going to Bocca instead."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Loved it!

Went with co-workers from work and everyone enjoyed their dish.  The steak entrée was delicious and very reasonably priced.  

We will be coming back for sure..."}
{"text":"Since having a few decent/nothing special experiences at Sambuca, when we were stuck on a place for our work holiday lunch, I suggested it. With their giant Italian inspired menu, I figured there would be something for everyone. 

I had spoken to them on the phone a few times prior to our reservation, to make changes and additions to the group. When they called an hour before our reservation to confirm, I was quite impressed - considering of all the changes, it was great to receive the call to make sure everything was set up.

HOWEVER - when the 9 of us arrived an hour later, there was no table. The server let us know that previous groups had not moved as quickly, and even though there was another large group's empty table (they were late), she wouldn't seat us. 

Quite annoyed, she asked us to wait for 10 minutes until the table became free. We waited (luckily our boss hadn't arrived yet), but the table was still not ready. She suggested we sit at Valens, which is owned by the same person - we agreed, and when she brought us over there, there were still no seats!! She suggested seating us at two tables for four at the opposite end of the restaurant - obviously having forgotten we were 9, and not 8.

I was really disappointed by this experience - especially considering the many phone calls and the large sign on the restaurant saying \"book your holiday party here\".

We ended up at another restaurant - and I will not be back to Sambuca!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Wuiet. Our server was great and made sure we were comfortable. The food portions are pretty big. I had the french toast and was pretty satisified. The food too a bit long but it was good."}
{"text":"Someone recommended the steak sandwich so I tried it with a side of greens. I thought the steak was too tough even though I had asked for it to be cooked medium rare. All in all, it was very much a forgettable experience."}
{"text":"Came here without much expectation because we were just in the area and there were less people in this patio versus their neighbour. There was a $25 prix fixed menu that looked pretty enticing but knowing that I was getting gelato down the street steered me away. I ordered the fungi risotto, and man was it delicious. It was hot and so fresh when being served. With a little bit of fresh pepper and I truly felt this was authentic. While the patio was nice and enjoyable, when paying inside it seemed dark and slightly too warm inside. But I'm not too sure if that changes come the cooler months when the doors are closed. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area !"}
