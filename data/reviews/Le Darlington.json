{"text":"Enjoyed supper last night and breakfast this morning, amazing food, friendly staff, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are staying at the Marriott Courtyard and have really enjoyed the Le Darlington Restaurant. The service is excellent.  (Thanks to Gennaro!!!) The food is well presented and very tasty. We have gone there several times since arriving."}
{"text":"Well not that impressed. Sangria not that good (pretty weak in fact). I'm sure that Jim Jones Cool-Aid is better. The smell of B.O coming inside the restaurant is unbelievable. Not coming back ever!!"}
{"text":"My suggestion is to skip for breakfast if your in a rush. Very little attention when you need to get in and out quickly. Food sub par. I can see the staff does try but I've been a regular to the hotel for business and I tried a few times now but it doesn't seem to get better. Waited 20 minutes for fruit salad, croissant and yogurt."}
{"text":"Another work even here. I have to say the service at this restaurant is excellent. Our party was large, around 18-20 ppl. We had around 8 appetizers to share. That's 8 different appetizers each. And every single one of them was delicious. 

For mains we had 2 mains... yes I know I sound like a pig but this was a work event. We had the Italian sausage pasta and a 16 oz steak. The pasta was good not amazing. I thought I wouldn't have room for the steak but boy was I wrong. The gravy that came with the steak was soooo good I finished 75% of my steak even though I was so full.

As for dessert I got a pistachio ice cream. It was so smooth and it came with a cannoli. Amazing.

Once again I was rolling out of the restaurant. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The very pricey restaurant is inside the Marriot Courtyard. It is advertised as a steakhouse to the public (not just hotel guests). The server was very nice and efficient. The food quality was absolutely horrible, and I'm a college student: my standards aren't that high to begin with.

For an appetizer, we ordered the mozzarella/tomato/balsamic vinaigrette and it was not good. The mozzarella was chewy and tasted like it was about to expire. The tomato slices were so old that they were dry. It was not fresh at all.   

Our dinner came out 10 mins after ordering. We ordered a risotto as an entree and it was inedible. It was so undercooked that the risotto was still hard and crunchy. We had to send it back and take it off our bill. Instead of apologizing, the chef said insisted it was cooked \"al dente\". Risotto is a rice: you don't cook rice \"al dente\". I would have appreciated if the chef just owned up and admitted to undercooking it.

 I ordered a Piccata dish. In the description, it sounded like a vegetarian pasta dish with a piccata sauce. When it came out, it was veal with potatoes and bell peppers in a lemon sauce. The veal was extremely chewy and overlooked. It tasted bland and was rubbery. The potatoes were still cold and raw in the middle. The bell peppers were charred (which was fine) but just randomly placed on the plate. It didn't fit well. 

All in all, the food was absolutely terrible. Hotels are not generally known for their stellar restaurant food quality. This was no different. A piece of advice to the restaurant: cut down on the number of dishes you offer and focus on a couple of good dishes."}
{"text":"For a hotel restaurant, the food was pretty good here. The pepperoni pizza was excellent. The margarita pizza was a little on the oily side. I wasn't a fan of the jalapeño poppers, which tasted like they contained processed cheese.  Service was ok, not great."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Marriott for a long weekend to visit Montreal, and we waited until our last day to have breakfast (wanted to try the local fare).  We're pleasantly surprised by the value and quality of the food (at least breakfast).  Our kids were able to get kids crepes with banana and Nutella that were delicious and a good value compared to the other crepe places we tried over the weekend.  Mom and dad were able to get \"regular\" American breakfast of eggs and toast.  Our \"over medium\" eggs were prepared perfectly (can't say that about many of the diners we've visited).  Worth having breakfast if you're close or staying at the Marriott!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner yesterday. The location was beyond convenient since the restaurant is attached to the Courtyard Marriott (and we didn't feel like going terribly far).

We started with some complementary warm bread...more like crostini...with whipped butter. We ordered a bottle of Syrah and decided on the salmon tartare appetizer. The plan was to share the salmon but we were told that it was rather small. On the contrary...the portion was actually rather generous: chopped pieces of raw salmon combined with a little bit of mayonnaise and onion; topped with arugula and a small piece of tomato. Underneath was a lovely avocado purée.... served with a side of that delicious bread.

We were going to order another appetizer and then entrées. We had the nachos and only ate a little bit before we had to call it quits. Got full fast! The nachos were very good and served with plenty of jalapeños.

The menu is extensive with plenty of variety. The service was a little bit slow but we did arrive between lunch and dinner services. We also weren't in a rush so we didn't mind the relaxed pace."}
