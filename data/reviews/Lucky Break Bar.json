{"text":"My 2nd visit at lunchtime on a weekend - Staff is welcoming - Food is fantastic.  Plenty of seating, tv's, pool tables, and beats every other Grill/Bar in at least a 5 mile radius of McClintock and Guadalupe ( On second thought, not sure that I should yelp this because I don't want it to get so popular I can't get get a seat when football starts ) Great place (so far)..."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my bad encounter months ago. It turns out there was a bad apple behind the bar who apparently isn't there anymore. 

I've had a great time each time I've been back to Lucky Break. Nice staff, fun menu of daily specials, good place to go watch the game - any game. And there's room to spread out if you have a big group. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I really want Lucky Break to do well.  I want to give them 5 stars.  I want it to be my favorite place ever.  

It's not 5 stars.  But it's pretty darn good.

I know it just opened around Christmas time.  We were in once the first week and it seemed like they were maybe still getting their footing.  Couple stumbles, but nothing unforgiveable.

We've been back a couple times since and I've been very happy each time.

The decor is very nice.  TONS of giant-screen TVs.  Not a bad seat in the house it seems.  The bar looks very sleek.  The pool tables are very nice looking and they play pretty nicely as well.  The shuffleboard table seems very short.  We didn't play it, but it just seemed like half a table.  Would love it if it were more on par with other bar shuffleboards -- but I realize they are not the most space-friendly game to keep normally.  

The beer selection is great.  They've got a good variety on tap, and more in bottles/cans.  Lots of craft beers - lots of local beers as well.  I was quite pleased with that.  Each time I've gone, I've been given a suggestion of something new to try - they have not steered me wrong yet.

The food is decent.  It's maybe a couple dollars more than cheap sports bars like Zipps and the like.  In some cases, it seems worth it.  

The burger was really good - had the one with fried jalepenos, etc on it.  Can't wait to try more burgers, honestly.  The buffalo wings were also good.  I'm so picky when it comes to buffalo wings, and these are good -- simple flavor, not too fatty - just how they should be.  

The nachos were mediocre.  But then again, I never expect much from bar nachos, so I wasn't really disappointed.  I got what I expected from it.  There is a ton of crap on it -- the pork and chicken were nice, the chorizo wasn't great.  But I tend to prefer a spicier, pork based chorizo and I think this was a fairly mild beef chorizo.  Nothing special.  Not bad...just not my favorite menu item.

The pool seemed kind of pricey (you rent the table/balls, rather than putting in quarters).  If you play fast games because you're really good at pool, then maybe this is a good deal.  If you suck at pool like I do and games take forever...it's not as good of a deal.  

The service has always been very friendly.  Nothing that blew me away, but certainly competent.  

Happy hour is a decent deal - I believe it's 1/2 off appetizers and a dollar off beers (or something like that).  I believe they also do something (giveaways, etc) on Fridays if you follow them on Facebook or Twitter, but I'm not sure.  

I'll definitely be back...Lucky Break has potential to get even better, so I'm hoping that others will catch on to this place and keep them in business!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Tons of seating options. Really nice pool setup and a good beer selection at decent prices....can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Bad service, bad atmosphere....bad everything. I dont recommend this establishment. It took me 10 minutes to even be greeted when I got there. The food was terrible. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the bills game while on vacation. Bit of a quiet calm atmosphere for a sports bar. Food was good though. The sweet potato tots with the cinnamon honey butter were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I go it gets a little busier and busier. People are starting to hear about Lucky Break and if you haven't, you better check it out!  Very clean, friendly people and food is great! I am obsessed with their Blackened Ahi Tacos! So yummy. Yep that's right I said Ahi Tacos at a bar. Their food is way better then typical bar food. If they continue to do what they are doing, I will continue to stop by as often as possible. Also they have happy hour everyday from 3-7 (Ahi tacos included) Pool tables are nice and new to play on as well. Ladies the bathrooms are always clean too!"}
{"text":"Awesome service.  Came just to watch  UFC fight but will definitely come again. One of the best sonoran dogs around. At least 20 tvs. No matter where your table is you'll have a tv near by. Great family friendly environment.  Will recommend to all my friends.  This is my new favorite hangout."}
{"text":"My friend I found this place on yelp. We were in the mood to play some pool and just find a relaxed atmosphere and not too crowded. Went here on a Thursday night and the crowd size was perfect, the music wasnt too loud, the bartender named Nicole was really cool, there was just the right amount of flat screen tv's, I was able to hear our conversation, plus we played pool for free that night til close. For the first time being there, it was definitely a good first impression."}
{"text":"The band tonight was great.
The food was horrible!!
The service was the worst!
The waitress never delivered my friends drink order. Came back after I had to chase her down to tell us 35 minuets later, they don't have white zifendel ??? 
Never came back to our table again."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the date of 08/04/16. I normally love this place, but tonight I ordered 2 burgers to go and they were LOADED with pepper. Seriously, like straight chomping on a mouthful of peppercorns. It was a late night order - around 10 pm. When I tried to call and report the issue after taking a few bites, no one answered the phone. ): Hopefully they see this and tell the chef to go easy on the pepper next time!"}
{"text":"UPDATE SINCE MANAGEMENT CHANGED.  Service is back to what it should be.  The bartendresses remember our drinks of choice and even our names, even though we are only in a couple times a month.  Their Bloody Mary base changed too, and it is awesome.  Come here!


MY OLD REVIEW - Service is awful if you don't sit at the bar.  Mike (bartender) is by far the best staff at the place.  Good beers and food.  Their bloody Mary's are the worst thing I've ever tasted because they use some weird (homemade?) mix.  Firecracker turkey burger is amazing (I usually prefer beef but for some reason the turkey burgers here are just delish)."}
{"text":"I met  friends there for our first time, the waitress was friendly however they had no cook so no food was being served. The cooked quit and manager fired some staff. Not a good first impression probably won't return for and after work get together. I would think the manager should be able to cook if no one else is available not just tell customers there will be no food tonight."}
{"text":"So you are a neighborhood bar/restaurant yet when anyone comes in you are rude and inattentive. From two glass eyes to lucky break- You would be lucky to not patronize this establishment. Maybe one day we will have a friendly welcoming bar in our neighborhood. Hint Hint take a que from Arcadia tavern."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Bar Owner, 
    I have been looking forward to 99 cent PBRS since Tuesday. We came in as a group of 5 with capacity and skill to drink at least $60 worth. More than enough to pay for a $30 keg of PBR. The nice lady bartender was happy to see us as she remembered my sister and I from Tuesday. They conveniently had a \"tap change\" the nite before. We were soooo disappointed. Then the big mean man crossed his arms and said he wasn't going to give us PBR and suggested Coors lite. Ppfffttt Coors lite did NOT win a blue ribbon at an annual event in 1893 and is therefore unacceptable. Just because the mountains turn blue on the can doesn't mean they won a Blue ribbon. The big mean guy with something to prove was completely rude and even told us they had 6 kegs in the back!! What!?!?! He simply didn't feel like tapping a keg for us for the advertised 99 cent PBR. 
The nice lady bartender tried to get him to do it and he simply refused. It is clear why they were empty on a Friday nite. We have tons of friends that we would have brought next week.. tough titties they're missing out on our special brand of alcoholism. Why would you rather have an empty bar, than tap a cheap ass keg of PBR and send 5 well tipping customers away. Your loss Lucky Break."}
{"text":"I went into Lucky Break since I saw that they served green chiles and had a decent happy hour. We were pleasantly surprised with the overall look of the bar, being that it was in a strip mall and had no expectations looking from the outside. We sat at the bar on a Saturday evening around 5pm which there was one male bartender, which we didn't catch his name since there was no introduction. We were asked for I.D's before a simple \"hello\" which I was glad to be I.D'd being close to forty. We had to ask for the happy hour specials, knowing they had them, and seemed like we had to tug it out of him, like he didn't want to advertise them. The list showed an I.P.A from a local Arizona brewery, which local beers during happy hour were $3. I was informed that the list wasn't current and they didn;'t have ANY I.P.A's out of 20+ taps. My husband asked what else was on Happy Hour and the bartender had to look at the menu to let him know. We sat at the bar for about an hour, then decided to go to the dart area. The whole time at the bar, the bartender was not engaging and could care less that we were one of the \"FOUR\" people at his bartop. We moved to the dart area, where the manager  was slumped over a table which seemed to be holding him up. We were in the dart area, close to the bar for about two hours, which we observed the bartender from close by. He was more engaged with his staff members, who were hanging around the service area, rather than the few people at his bar top. I am a bartender myself, and understand the importance of customer engagement and building up your clientele. The two hours that we were at the darts, the manager never came by to us, or anyone else in the establishment to check out how things were going. He actually never moved from being slouched over the table, except to eat a meal. The place was pretty dead for a Saturday night. 4-5 people at the bar, 2-3 tables at most, and a couple pool tables being occupied. Absolutely no reason for the bartender and manager to be engaging in the guests. I feel really sorry for the owners of the bar, since they are giving all the necessary tools to be successful. Also with the selection of craft beer, they told a guest they were not allowed to give a sample of the beer to taste to see if they would like to purchase a pint. Very poor staff and management that is hindering the potential of a decent bar."}
{"text":"As a regular patorn of Doc and Eddy's down the street I have tried to give this place a chance multiple times. First off the place is very nice and the food is great. However, if you sit at the bar and are expecting good service forget about it. I have been here 5 times and all but once sat at the bar. The table service is pretty good however the bar service is about the worst I have seen anywhere I have been. The last time the bar was completely empty and it still took 22 minutes to get a drink. Yes I timed it. and that just wasn't the first time I have done this.

If I didn't prefer to sit at the bar the rating would have been a 4.5."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and goes by the name \"Scully's\" now. Which is unfortunate, because Scully's is a far cry from the good ol' Lucky Break I used to know and love.

I went in here for a Saturday afternoon college game. The crowd was decent; not overwhelming but not dead either. I go to the bar and grab a menu. The items are mostly the same. There're a few new dishes I didn't recognize from the Lucky Break of old. I ordered the chili cheese tots; definitely won't be doing that again. They were God-awful. Just a big, sloppy, greasy mess.

The bartender was a guy whose name I forget. He was nice enough. Got my drinks fairly quickly, but didn't seem too personable. Maybe it was a weird day for him, who knows?

The waitress didn't seem any better. I wasn't served by her, but every time she'd pass there was a dead look in her eyes and she never smiled. Geez, at least pretend you wanna be there.

Overall, I don't think I'll be back. The place is weird compared to the Lucky Break I'm used to. Time to find a new watering hole."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and bar. Great owner and the staff is very attentive. The food and drink are above your average bar . I have read some of the reviews and most are for when it was lucky break which had bad food and lousy managers. .try scullys and you will like this place."}
{"text":"I just found Lucky Break a couple of months ago. Have been there 6 times now. The food is excellent and electric atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting over the wekend and stumbled upon this gem!
I was amazed that it had only been open for less than a week!
Being from New England, I stopped in to watch the Patriots game.The Video presentation for the sports were second to none.
It didn't bother me that I was the only Pat's fan. The ambiance, energy, and professioanlly trained staff, made me feel right at home.
The selction of beers were amazing, as well as the food that I sampled! I would pit their burger against any other high end burger joint that I dined at.
I even challenged my girlfriend to a game of Billiards, because I was having so much fun there. 
The icing on the cake were the reasonable prices! I didn't get sticker shock, and it the experience didn't burn a hole in my wallet.
If I lived in AZ, this would definetely be my new hang out!"}
{"text":"So, I went back last night. I wanted to see if anything had changed. It's...slightly better.

 The bartender was pretty good, made sure everyone's drinks were always full, and seemed like a decent guy in general. The server, bless her sweet soul, actually changed one of the tv's for us. Without acting bothered or confused. She just. ..did it. I was pleasantly surprised.

The place was pretty dead.  Basically consisted of a few old men looking for a friend to help pass the time til they pass out. There are only 3 pool tables now, and it's 1.00 a game. Kind of a joke. The bartender was cool enough to just open the table for us and let us play as much as we want after the table ate 2 dollars from us.

Other than that, same place, new name (again)."}
{"text":"Arrived, sat around for 30 minutes before they gave us menus. Then we sat around for 30 minutes and nobody took our order. We left and went to a different place."}
{"text":"Really likin' this place!  I credit these guys wit helping me to regain an appetite for food after a few difficult weeks.  SWEET POTATO TOTS w/ Marshmallow Cinnamon Dipping Sauce! REALLY? Its awesome!  You MUST Try This!  Did I mention they have a TON of GREAT Craft Brews ON TAP as well?
 PS. Anyone for a game of pool? The tables are quite nice!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food at Lucky Break is great.  We came in with a group of 12 us and sat down to order and asked the waitress for separate checks by couple which I know the pain but most of us use credit cards.  When we got our check the waitress had separated the check, however, she separated all the food on one check and all the drinks on another check.  Also one person in our party did not get her food until the rest of us had finished eating.  So I chalk this up to bad service one time.  I thought I try it again and  was pleasantly surprised. We got great service, the food was excellent, and the atmosphere was nice as well.

Definitely try Taco Tuesday as the tacos are delicious. I got the seared Ahi tuna tacos and they were scrumptious and inexpensive. They have great nightly specials with discount drinks and food.  And free pool on Tuesday night.

Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed (unless you get the server we had the first time)..."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. I'm literally sitting in here as I post this. The sign says \"please seat yourself\" and I've sat at the same table for twenty minutes now and not a SINGLE server has even greeted me ! Let alone ask me if I want a drink. Nice atmosphere but I value service, and I see ZERO here. Lets see how long it takes before I can get an ice tea...."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time before the name change. Came on a fight/ poker night, and have one waitress working our area. It's not her fault but I shouldn't have to wait 20 + min for a beer. This place has totally gone down hill, which is sad!  You should not have a poker night during a giant fight night! Sadly this will be one of the last times that I come here!"}
{"text":"Came here to play some pool and eat hot wings on my birthday with a party of 15 to 20 people great service great times have the whole area to ourselves even did some breakdancing... the bartender was a bit rude to us when we got there and I had to ask the manager to open up a few pool tables for us which he was cool enough to do thanks for a great time will be back soon"}
{"text":"I would call myself a regular here. My softball team goes almost every Friday after our game. If you are going to eat I recommend any burger. You can't go wrong! The service is hit or miss depending on who you get. They always have good drink specials, different ones each night. They also have pool tables, but they fill up quick on the weekends. Overall it's a pretty solid place. It keeps us coming back week after week."}
{"text":"Kid friendly and great food items.  They have all the bar regulars plus a nice foodie touch to their menu.  Dishes come out looking great and tasting better.  Wait staff handled special orders easily and cheerfully.  Check this place out, keep it busy, don't let tempe lose a nice local spot!!"}
{"text":"Wow. 

It's both sad and fascinating to see this business kill itself off over time. 

I'm not even sure happy hour specials exist here anymore. The price has sharply gone up on pitchers of domestic beer, through which they used to make a solid $5 per visit. They now make $0 per visit. 

I ate a hamburger there last time I went. I didn't die, but the price was a good $3 more expensive than comps (30% higher), and priced on par with Red Robin (which makes a significantly better hamburger) and Smashburger (same). If you're going there to meet with people, eat at one of the several dozen restaurants in the block first. 

I'm not sure what draw remains for customers. Specialty drinks? Not that I'm aware of. Cheap drinks? No. Specials? Long gone. Good service? I'm not going to fault the only employee who works there for not being able to get around to a loaded table, but it points to a management issue. 

In sum, look for this business to come on the real estate market soon. Maybe someone else can do better."}
{"text":"Tried AGAIN...STILL ONE STAR. Chloe was working.  8 people in the bar.  She said sorry I'm the only one here. I can't serve you on the patio. No problem. You're dead dead dead...poor service is the reason! Come on guys, how many years is it going to take? I ordered cherry vodka and diet coke. She gave me cherry and club soda. Reminder...8 people in the entire huge bar!!! SMH!"}
{"text":"Love the setup, love that they have pool tables, love the big screens, great music, great atmosphere, great servers, good food.  Ultimate Grilled Cheese is indeed ultimate...it's a stand out dish that put a smile on my foodie friend's face; not a fan of the veggie burger tho.  But overall, I can dig it..."}
{"text":"I came here once before and loved it. I came back today and the waitress asks me if my hair is real! When I look at her puzzled she says \"well I had to ask.\" ??? Awful"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as I like the beer menu but the service is just not acceptable. I've been here twice and both times I felt ignored. If you ask me if you want ham or bacon on the grilled cheese sandwich and the answer is \"yes\" then you should put it in the sandwich. Finally the waitress comes back to ask how the meals are  (we were almost done) and we told her the grilled cheese didn't come with the ham we asked for. I thought she had forgot about us again and some guy from the kitchen comes out with a slab of ham. WTH? I would have liked a another beer but she never came back to ask. Second time we went there the server was spending too much talking with several girls playing pool to even care how we were doing. The pork nacho's were tasteless, my hotdog bun was hard and my son couldn't finish his chili that came with his grilled cheese although the ham was actually in the sandwich this time. I expect much more for the $60 I spent."}
{"text":"As I attended a meetup at Lucky Break, it was my first time through the doors of this establishment. It is bigger than I anticipated and the bar is big, their menu is more than enough and of course they have several pool tables inside. But I wasn't here to play pool.

They have pretty good beer selection, where the local (Arizona) ones are cheap for happy hour. So are several of their dishes like sliders for $4, totally worth it and comes with sweet tater tots. This to me that's weird, but it's a great deal for someone to eat something while sucking down some awesome beers or margaritas. 

I consider this place a dive, but then again I do enjoy a good dive bar. Every day they have a different happy hour special, and some days it looks to be a fantastic deal. Since I have a hard time turning down a good deal - I know I will be back here.

They have some music going, and I have no idea where it comes from but it played everything from early Kiss to Beastie Boys. Nothing to brag about, but the music is totally appropriate for the venue. Service was good - we had a new waitress waiting on us, and as she might not be the strongest person to recommend stuff, she didn't get one order wrong... and really that's what matters.

I would never have chosen this place to go to.. ever. But I am glad I ended up here, and I will be back. That is a certainty. 

..und das.."}
{"text":"So I live by this place and the staff is super cool, especially the bartenders they're awesome, and prices are pretty reasonable, but this review is SOLEY for the General Manager. I'm watching the fights and it's on every TV I over heard some guy at the bar wanting to watch a football game and basically the GM cussed out the customer saying \"We pay a lot of money for this bullshit (UFC) and we are not going to f*** around with other sh** so if you don't like that well *shrugged*. I've worked in restaurants and customer service a long time and have never heard a manager basically tell a customer to F off... so he sucks and that's probably why it's not busy at all here on UFC fight night. Like I said the bartenders will do you right but he's a genuine douche."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times, not that bad...

Went in today, employees were sitting in the side, we sat down for 15min, no one even acknowledged us there.. There were 4 of us!  New customers bring you money.. Give us no attention and we leave! Too bad for you."}
{"text":"I've shot pool here a few times, and the place is that weird in between of busy and happening and empty and dead. Just can't seem to get it right. Service is ok, the food is also ok, my doors definitely aren't blown off"}
{"text":"Great little bar nice atmosphere. Just stopped in the other day. Pool tables and great staff. Looks like it's a new name or new ownership tho. Recommend checking this place out. New to yelp but not new to good service!"}
{"text":"They have no idea how to do NFL Sunday football to cater to all NFL fans. They kept changing channels and half of there tv signs where games were suppose to be located did not match. Don't bother coming for a game unless your a Browns fans (no offense to the Browns fans). They need to take NFL Sunday customer service from other bars who have experience. The owner was a douche and lied about certain tv's being linked together just bc he was to much of an ass to change to the tv the sign stated in the 1st place...."}
{"text":"The blurb on top of my Yelp page under the YOUR NEXT REVIEW AWAITS heading says You've checked in here X amount of times - what keeps you coming back? Had to think about that for a moment and the answer is obvious. Sucky service. You think that would keep most people away and you'd probably be right. In some weird way I think that's why I keep coming BACK to this place. Not because I enjoy sucky service but because that sucky service keeps OTHER folks from coming back and because of that the place is never too crowded. So this becomes the choice of places to drink and chill when you know your actual favorite haunts will be packed to the gills like say sports bars during an ASU or Cardinals game or during graduation week, etc. We know this place is bound to be less crowded than elsewhere and guess what? That happens to be true 99.9% of the time. The sucky service acts like a sieve weeding people out - the same way some places intentionally pipe in classical music to keep the gangstas out or blast loud gangsta rap to keep the geriatrics out. So here's to sucky service - yeah, I'm a glass half full guy - we still get our beers eventually. So the waitresses here aren't neurosurgeons but you don't need a stratospheric IQ to bring a pint of beer from the bar to a table, right? The food here is also just ok. But if we're in a big group and wanna go to a bar on an impromptu last minute type of deal - we pretty much know we'll get a table to accommodate our needs here. And the service means the going away party or whatever isn't going to last too long because of the service and that way you made your appearance and don't have to make a whole night of it because most of the folks will leave after a drink or two. Friday nights they have trivia and you can win gift cards for this place - making sure you'll be back to spend them here. In a mall with a huge parking lot on the southeast corner of McClintock and Baseline that also has restaurants like Little India, China Town Buffet, Nandini Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"They are under new ownership. Dave is awesome and made me feel more welcome. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing seared Ahi tuna tacos. My group and i were 15 deep and everyone had a drink and were even able to buy our celebration shots instantly. Our server Blake suggested to my buddy and I that the Ahi tacos were really good and we went for it, thankfully, we were just gonna have some burger sliders... The sauce and freshness surprised me, just enough seasoning to complement the texture."}
{"text":"Came to eat and the food was horrible the fish was over cooked and the fries was over cooked and asked for nachos no chicken and it was filled with old tasting chicken ."}
{"text":"Well, went back here to watch one of the NCAA semifinals. On Saturday night an entire section of the bar was reserved for a kids baseball team and their parents. Is this a sports bar or a Chucky cheese? Thought that was kinda lame. I only mention that because as we were sitting at the bar eating our $2 garlic parmesan fries (which had a nice amount of garlic on sturdy frozen steak fries) we noticed the big TV at the bar was very blurry. Yes, we were seeing double on that TV, so we had to move, but 1/2 the bar was off limits. Blurry TV..uhhh get it fixed. 
      The drink specials and beers here are always good, but food is still kinda shaky. As a sports bar, how can you not have mozzarella sticks or potato skins on the menu? My friend ordered the $7.95 BBQ chicken dinner, but this isn't BBQ, the breast is off the bone and then they simply cover the chicken with a bottled? BBQ sauce. So, it's technically  BBQ chicken, wink, wink, but real BBQ chicken is on the bone and actually gets sauced while cooking. My entree was way more successful as I had the Orchard salad with blackened chicken added for $2.95, which made this salad about $12. The chicken is this dish was outstanding, a great version of the blackened seasonings. My request for dressing on the side was ignored, so I just ate it anyway and the raspberry vinagarette, which the waitress said was homemade, wasn't too sweet afterall. Alot of tasty walnuts and dried cranberries appeared as well. 
    Waitress and follow-up guy server were very attentive and nice and I thank the management for sending me a gift card which I used to fun most of the meal."}
{"text":"Rude and impersonal bartender. No knowedge of his beer menu and HORRIBLE MUSIC PLAYING ALL DAY.  pool tables have that awful red felt ...rough to the touch and not well maintained.  When i say horeible music i mean a strange mixture of pop country, electronic with female vocals, and some old justin timberlake songs. I was so relieved when he played just a girl by no doubt."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and bar food.  The atmosphere is pretty cool inside.  With billards, lots of tvs/projectors and smoke free!  The place has only been open since December and does lots of promotions/specials throughout the week.  The location is a bit eh, since its located in strip mall thats none too impressive.  However, not a bad place to just hang out for a few hours."}
{"text":"Great place!! My husband and I love hoppy beers and this place has us covered. WITH MORE THEN 1!! They have a wide variety ( for Tempe ) of beers ranging from your 3.2( Bud, Coors ect.) beers to your IPA's. The prices are worth going back for too. The food is your average bar food. However, they make a killer batch of fried pickles!!!! Happy hour deals are perfect for food and drinks. They also have well kept pool tables. I do believe there is a dart board, shuffle board and a few arcade games as well. The staff are friendly, most of them are pretty good with keeping up with their tables/ seats. Some of the younger ones kind of show their age and experience levels while fluttering away at the server station gabbing and flicking around on their phones, ( unacceptable ) but the rest of their staff makes up for those girls. All in all I would absolutely call this a great place to gather."}
{"text":"If you are reading this then my goal is to keep you from wasting your time at this bar. You will find the crowd and staff to be some of the biggest scum bags you have ever met. If you fit in with this crowd then you might love it. If you have any self respect you will have a much better time at any of the more established pubs in the area. 

Bottom line, the service is awful, the food is barely edible, and there are much better options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Things to like
- Two dollar 8 ball pints
- Good food, especially the boneless wings
- Good service and friendly wait staff
- Football/Baseball/Basketball - YES!
Thinks to think about
- They changed happy hour menu.  Have only been once since
- Uncomfortable chairs"}
{"text":"My partner and I had lunch at Lucky Break today, and we loved it. Our server, Samantha, was incredibly friendly and made us feel very welcome. As a vegetarian, it's hard to find a good veggie burger, but Lucky Break loads their burgers with toppings, making them pretty incredible. They use Boca burgers, which aren't as good as house-made, but dripping with cheese and covered in green chilies and jalapenos, they're fantastic. They definitely don't mess around with the jalapenos; they use thick hand-cut slices with the seeds, so beware! They also have a great local beer selection and seem to have great daily and happy hour specials. I definitely recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Place is really good and the venue is great with high top table and booths. Pool available and tons of TVs to watch the game. Def top sports bar in the area. Burgers and service was amazing. I'd get the sweet potatoes tots and the peanut butter desert was really good. Will be back with a ton of friends!"}

{"text":"Food's great, pool tables are nice, servers are awesome! Why 2 stars then? Because it takes an executive order to change a channel to a sporting event that's EXTREMELY important to a customer. 

Give your staff the respect they deserve to be able to change a channel and my $50+ would've stayed at your bar instead of finding another place with the game on (thank you, Yelp!) and driving there to catch the second half of an important game. 

Your customer should NEVER have enough time to Yelp your competitor to get the service that's most important to them because, unfortunately for you, the other place had great food, terrific service and pool tables TOO!"}
{"text":"I met a ton of friends there for an event this evening. I had a great time , with the huge crowd they had great service. I will definitely be going back to this place ,they treat their clientele great. The food was terrific, the drinks alcoholic and non-alcoholic were perfect. I've already made plans to go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine works there so i went to give this place a try i went there Thursday night and last night l love the drink specials but the bartender has absolutely no hospitality he's rude and  inattentive. He has no knowledge of his own menu or specials. When I asked him for some drinks and he acted like it was an inconvenience On Thursday the kitchen was closed by 9, fast food restaurants don't even close that early. I asked the waitresses for some napkins and instead of grabbing me some she points to the side of the bar for me to grab them myself. Here's a helpful hint of the owner reads this fire your FOH staff or your business will be closed I have been in restaurant business for a decade so I know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour prices are the best I have found yet.This billiards, bar and grill is a hidden gem with great food. I had fish tacos that had huge chunks for cod fish dished with the right mix of sweet and sour cabbage. Awesome selection of craft beers and they do beer flights. I had to try the dessert called Peanut Butter Thing\" and let me just say yummo. Peanut butter cup, ice cream and oreo rolled into a thingy. The place is big and has lots of pool tables at one end and TV's everywhere.  The rest rooms were clean ( I always check that out) Staff was attentive and friendly. Thanks Lucky Break I'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"Good food, better than an average sports bar. We had burgers, a quesadilla and something called pig rig.  They were all excellent.  Service is slow, but attentive.  Kids meals are small for 10 year old, order an adult entree.  Lots of pool tables and very reasonable for the family to play."}
{"text":"I'm not going to say they have the \"best\" burgers near home, but they're just about my favorite.  I've had four of them, and they've all been fantastic.  Good beef, great buns, quality toppings.  And pretty cheap, too.

There's always something great on tap, especially hard-to-find seasonals from Arizona breweries.  They're up there with Boulders and Spokes when it comes to craft-beer-wow-factor.

Great happy hour deals most days of the week, nice quality pool tables, damn good wait staff... I think the only thing that's missing is a good patio, but they do what they can with their limited strip mall location and have a few tables out front."}
{"text":"When we pulled up, I was not happy my husband was taking me to a place in a strip mall for date night. But, we had a gift card from a charity event so I sucked it up. 

To my surprise, once you enter this place, you have no idea you are in a strip mall - between a gun shop and Chinese buffet. It is a great atmosphere with wood paneled walls (that sounds terrible, but it's nice) lots of TV's large booths and pool tables. My favorite part is they offer a great selection of local beers. 

Our waiter was Graydon who was fantastic. I had the chicken Philly and my husband had the chicken cordon blue. Both were surprising outstanding. I requested a side salad instead of fries and it came loaded up! Very impressive. 

We were pleasantly pleased with the service, price and food. No complaints here - other than I wish there was a Lucky Break by us in north Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the sever we got was a complete tool. My three roommates and I went there last night because we know some one who works there. So we sit down and order and all seems well, and the sever starts hassling us for IDs, we are all 21 so we don't care but we tell him most places don't turn into a bar until 9  So we tell him it's only 7 so we didn't show any ID, and instead of being cool about he runs to his manager like a lost puppy and tells on us. Then he comes back saying we can't come in next time unless we have a parent. No where in the restaurant does it say this, and even on their website, it says they celebrate birthdays of all ages... WTF? So half of us order a beer with dinner and half just stick with water. And sense us water drinkers didn't show any ID, the guy is watching us like s hawk. So half way through the meal my roommate tries my other roommates beer and instead of coming over and asking for an ID the little prick runs back to his manager. And the manager comes out and kicks my two roommates out who had a sip of beer and the sharer. They didn't even let him show ID they just kicked him out. So my last roommate and myself are the only ones left and the ass holes even gave us their beers and meals to pay for. And the cherry of the night was when we were filling out our checks we both gave a penny for tip and the server bum rushed the checks right as we were done signing them and looked right at the tips. So I'll repeat, great food, but the management and the short server with a belly and a bald head is a tool."}
{"text":"Horrible service.... No attentiveness... Mediocre/cold food...  Did not feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great bar... Good food (or at least what we had).  We had the nachos and the wings.  Server was really knowledgable about the menu and selections and we never had to wait to ask for a new beer.  Great service!! Beer was $3.50 for a 14 ounce and $4.50 for a 20 ounce.  $1 off during happy hour - and all appetizers were half off during happy hour.   I'm sure I'm missing some of the HH details!!  They have darts, video bowling, video golf and six pool tables.  Lots of TVs.

And for the previous review about Dennis Erickson... My dads even in several times since it opened as Lucky Break and has seen DE twice.  He chatted with him one time and it sounds like he still has some ownership in this place.

Overall a great environment!! Happy it's walking distance from our house!!"}
{"text":"Who running this place? No One. Terrible food. Ok little out dated Projection sports bar. Needs work! Food so bad. Nope. Don't go here. Creepy people on tiny patio. Please Serve yourself at the bar or you will not get a drink."}
{"text":"I went into Lucky Break last night for their second night of operation, and they already had several people who looked like they were at home there. I must admit, by the end of the night, I was starting to feel that way myself. They seem to really have things figured out from the get-go, which is actually quite a surprise to me!

Walking in, my first impression is just how clean this place is. Seriously, it's nice. They've got brand new huge TVs all over, showing every game you could want to watch. There's more than enough table and bar space for a large happy hour crowd. The place also has a very nice open feeling that's very welcoming. Also, they have 6 nice new pool tables, which are rented by the hour. Everything you would expect from a place called \"Lucky Break\" and then some.

Oh yeah then there's the bar. Coming into a billiards joint, I expect to see just your typical domestic beers, along with maybe Guinness as their \"fancy\" beer. Okay well they do have those. Then there's the craft beer. With 24 taps in total their selection is nothing to thumb your nose at. There are a good number of local AZ beers and some beers that you won't even see at most craft beer bars!

This place is just pure danger for me. Quality pool tables, great beer, and oh yeah the food is pretty damn good too."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do.  Its always something. I believe if I went there every single day the staff would act the same. You never feel welcome. Like the manager they look and act bored. On our last visit the manager Jarod was not there, off sick.  Nobody in the place so 3 or 4 server-girls are just standing in the back staring like they were chained to the bar or lost. My server Ryan was the only person who had a pulse and is always enthusistic about the food and alcohol selections. He is very attentitive and takes care of his guests.Perhaps the server-girls should shadow him and see how he works. So another woman, maybe another manager comes in and takes Ryan into the back room for a meeting? So with four customers in the place you would think the server-girls would check on us.  Uh uh they started playing darts. Empty glasses on the edge of the tables meant nothing to them. So the bartender Mike is down there too.  After 20 minutes we see Mike go into a different back door with one of the server-girls. If it wasn't Ryan we would have left.

Not sure who owns the place but start sending in shoppers!  See why people come in once and don't come back.  Jarod if you truly are the GM walk around and ask your customers how things are instead of laying at the end of the bar acting like the guests are diseased. I have been in there at least 35 times and you have never spoke to me once. Ya get two stars because of Ryan whose tip suffered because of the back up support."}
{"text":"Hoooooorrdrrrrrriiiiiiiiibbbbbbbbblllllllleeeeeeee!!!!!! This may be the worst bar in the entire world. The food was god awful, the drinks were watered down, and the service/waitress was the most incompetent person on the planet! Everyone beware!"}
{"text":"I really wish this place would step it up. Walking distance from my house, and so much potential to be a great local hang out place, especially for sports watching. Food is good, and lots of beer options, but the service is just bad. Last time I went with my wife for dinner and a beer, we literally sat at a booth for 20 minutes, and didn't get recognized by anyone. I even stood up several times and tried to make eye contact with workers, but nothing, and it wasn't that crowded, so no excuses. We ended up walking out and I don't think anyone even noticed we were there. Very disappointing as this would be a regular spot for us and several of my neighbors. If the owners/management reads this, PLEASE do something to improve your service. I am willing to try again, but this was not the first time we had bad or marginal service, and many of my neighbors have had similar experiences. We want this place to succeed, but I'm afraid it will just be another failed joint unless service becomes a priority."}
{"text":"Love Lucky  Break. Great food and beer. Oh, and you can play pool there too.

Should I elaborate? Order their burgers! You won't be disappointed. Lucky Break is making my \"Best Burgers\" list. If you're torn between their tots and fries, you should be because they're both delicious and perfectly seasoned.

Do you have room for dessert? Order the Peanut Butter Thing. Yeah, that's what it's really called. Ice cream mixed with gobs (and gobs) of peanut butter cups and coated with Oreo cookie crumbs. Mmm!"}
{"text":"New owner? Same place? I was here once before watching a Green Bay game, didn't look like much has changed. My girl and I stopped in because we heard there was live music now.

First......bartender was great and attentive, good beer selection.
2nd....Food, my girl ordered tot madness or something....tots, bacon hot dogs and chili....terrible.....not their fault, my girl ordered it.

Live music doesn't count in my book unless theres a stage. Being in a band I will never ever play on the floor. Im not quite sure if the live music was a comedy act. The guy seemed to have a parody to every song he sang on got lame really quick, too bad too, he had a great voice. He had his own little following of 20 people that found him amusing. 

Being a live music lover here's my advice.  Pull the trigger and build a stage and get a sound system. You have a great bar, and we are all tired of O'Kellys. I will come to Scullys ANYTIME over them if you make it look like a LIVE MUSIC VENUE.

Good Luck and hope to be back again!!! Come on Scullys.......SAVE US!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this bar. I love the beer selection. I love the bartenders. I hate the music. The music selection isn't appealing toward any sort of crowd. A jukebox for customer selection would be awesome. The music transitions are terrible and ruins the ambiance of the bar."}
{"text":"Was there on a Sunday afternoon.  Not a bunch of people there at the moment, but I can tell this place probably throws down on a weekend night.  They have all the fixins for a good time - photohunt, darts, billiards, Mrs. Pacman/Galaga.  Only had a beer so I can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed by my first trip to Lucky Break last night.  A friend had mentioned the place, and I checked out their website last week to see what they were about.  There are so many sports bars and pool halls around that I really wanted something different.  In this I mean a place where I can get a drink, shoot some pool or watch sports, and eat QUALITY food!  At Lucky Break, everything satisfies.

The service was outstanding.  Michelle was our server, and she was very attentive.  The other servers went out of their way to deliver drinks when she was busy.  The teamwork was excellent.

The ambiance and decor were inviting.  The design and  floor space was open, comfortable, clean and new.  The bathrooms were clean and kept.

They had plenty of drink options from local beer to interesting cocktails.  I can't recall if they served wine.

I am a big foodie, and there is nothing more satisfying than surprisingly good food at a sports bar or pool hall.  I only tried one item on my first trip, but I can tell they do things right.

I had the Jamaican Jerk wings.  They were delicious.  Perfectly fried wings, fresh and hot, tossed in a very complex home-made Jerk sauce.  The presentation was beautiful.  The wings were stacked into a wall, and on the side was a fan of three fresh carrots and celery sticks resting on a leaf of lettuce.  

The small things, from the fresh carrots and celery sticks, to the fresh lime wedges in my drink, to the home-made wing sauce, really makes Lucky Break worth the visit for the food and drinks alone.  Not to mentioned the entertainment and fine service.

This place really pays attention to detail, and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"This place is an appreciated break from the monotony of Tempe. Families, graduates, and locals converged here today for 2 games, and the energy of the rivalries made me feel at home :-)"}
{"text":"I had the absolute worst experience at scullys last night. I have been going to this place for over a year now, pretty sure I will never go there again. I had to ask THREE times for a water, a friend of mine waited over FORTY FIVE minutes for a burger while another friend asked for wings that NEVER got rung up. This place has done nothing but go downhill since the new owner took over. I enjoyed going to this place when it was called Lucky Break. You now have to PAY to play pool, all of the pool tables have been replaced with the coin operated tables. After I complained to a manager about my poor experience they comped my bill, I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they are never really super busy to the point of it being completely obnoxious. My boyfriend and I went there again to just hang out and play pool. They have huge tv screens everywhere playing everything from music videos, to news to sports. Their drink prices are decent and so is the flavor of their food. All I know is that this place is just a nice chill low key place that plays great music and does not try too hard with their ambiance.This was our second time being here and we will be back!"}
{"text":"How to screw up a breakfast. Deep fried bacon. Over easy was over hard. No home fries they subbed Tatar tots . WTH ....come on guys! Someone should have entered a plea."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER - I have only come here for drinks and pool...I have never eaten here so this review is excluding anything to do with the food.

 I have been here a few times when it was Scully's. I was never really \"impressed\" with the place by any means but it was an ok lil dive bar with a couple of pool tables and strong pours. The staff was always friendly enough so everything was cool.

I came in last night and its now called The Lucky Break - great name. The place seemed cleaner and like it had some small changes that made big impacts. Good stuff.

Sounds good right? Why 3 stars? Service and watered down drinks. 

I had 2 Bacardi Cokes and my friend was drinking vodka oj's...both were very light. We had a buzz when we got there and had list it by the time we left.

Since ALLLLL of their 4 pool tables were taken, we were sitting at the bar which was not busy (even at 10pm on a saturday night - should've been my first clue). It still took over 10 minutes to get a refill!! Another couple sat next to us at the bar. The bartender addressed then and said \"I'll be right with you\"...then walked away and cleaned glasses for over 5 minutes lol They were pissed!

Also, the crowd in here sucked. A old man, who must have been about 133 years old, was out on the smokers patio painfully hitting on 2 drunk and VERY loud 40-something women. The thirst was real! Mainly an older crowd.

ALL IN ALL, this is a place where the ghost of failed relationships past goes to drink his sorrow away...with watered down liquor. SMH"}
{"text":"Lucky Break certainly is a surprise to walk into as it is certainly nicer than its modest surroundings would lead you to believe. Once inside, you will find plenty of seating that isn't crowded together and several well lit pool tables with new(er) cues.  
My burger was yummy and much better than average bar fare. You can also substitute beef for chicken or a veggie option.  They have specials, including happy hour, every day and a large draft beer selection. Prices are fair and the restrooms were clean, always something I look for in a bar & grill. 
My only complaint is that they had one barkeep on a Friday night and they have a very long bar, making it hard to get their attention.  Would I come here again?  Yes."}
{"text":"We got a coupon on our windshield wiper for a free burger with the purchase of the same, and thought why not?  As others have said, the business is located in a strip mall.  Upon first glance, it looks like it won't be great. Once you walk inside, the place features interesting wood walls, a separate area for eating and playing pool, and a long expanse of bar.  There were tons of wide-screen televisions with many games to watch.

Our server, Blake, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  He helped my husband pick out the perfect beer.  The food was great.  My burger had brie and portobello mushrooms and was tender as could be.  My husband had another burger and reported that his was delicious as well.  The steak fries were peppered up, making ketchup unnecessary.  I can't recall the last time I've eaten fries and not needed the ketchup.

We played trivia and listened to music, while having drinks.  The place was rather slow, but I suspect that's just growing pains.  We have nothing bad to say about our experience.  If only all sports bars had the kind of service and food we had.  We are excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Rough Music & No Service

New Ownership from what it was years ago.

We used to go here a couple times a week, it was a great place to spend the whole night playing pool and eating food with friends....

New owner was friendly when I met him right after he took it over more than a year ago. He was more a business man. 

Now free tables on off peak nights are replaced by put your bills in at the table which is fine. It's only $5 for 6 games or $1 a game so I was good with that. I was glad to see they were not as spends as last time I came here!

This trip during a whole 6 games of pool with myself in the corner nobody came to take my drink for food order... 

Not many people for a Saturday night except some really young kids drinking beer and shooting pool and a scattered bunch of adults at the bar...

Last trip I had a super nice blonde girl that was my waitress who did great, but that was about a year ago in late 2015-early 2016

It went from a cool hangout to let's not get noticed...

So onward I shall travel to find somewhere to waste the night away....

Kind of disappointed this place lost the cool... it was one of my a few times a week hang outs a few years ago when I lived near here..."}
{"text":"Huge place with free pool on Sunday's! Huge tvs at literally every angle --this place is for you if you plan on watching football Nice service!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Lots of room and big TV's to watch sports! Have been here once before nothing bad to say about this place the food is good too."}
{"text":"Nice set-up for just dining, hanging out at the bar and playing billiards.  Regulation tables that are very clean and level.  All the sticks are good quality, so a great place to practice your skills.  Lots of TV's, so great place for a game night to drink, play billiards, even darts and eat some yummy food.  Had the chicken quesadilla.  Filling, cheesy, and decently priced.  Patrons of all ages. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"I am honestly disappointed at the service. Low on staff and the quality of food doesn't even compare to a McDonald's hamburger. Speaking of which ... I may just not even eat my food and go get a better quality right there. New owners have set the bar low. Good luck on your invest because today you have one customer less."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Foods good service is good. Who can't say they love a few games if free pool? Great place to grab a beer"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a weekday with my son and there were only about 5 tables occupied.  We started with the Hummus appetizer and got way more than expected - hummus, pita bread, tortilla chips, pico de gallo, and cucumbers.  It was easily enough for 3 or 4 people to share.

My entree was the Green Chili Chicken sliders and I really enjoyed the spicy flavor and juiciness of the meat.  My only suggestion would be to use a heartier bread as the buns became soggy.  It didn't keep me from eating them though!  My son had the kid's chicken strips and they looked a little strange when the waitress brought them out.  The breading was very dark, so they appear burned.  I tasted one and thankfully they were not burned at all, the breading they use actually has a nice flavor and the chicken was moist.  My son ate them all up!

I hope this place gets busier or has a big enough crowd on the weekend to keep them going.  The food is much better than typical bar food and they have a lot of unique twists on old favorites.  The staff is also wonderful.  While I was waiting for our bill, the bartender took pity on my impatient son and showed him how to play darts!"}
{"text":"The Things that Work. Really well:

-the burgers. Seriously delicious, imaginative and well constructed burgers. Every time.
-the beer. Options! And real knowledge from the bartender! Like 10-15 on draft and a handful by the bottle.
-the liquor. Again, options! And fun specialty cocktails. And bartenders who know how to construct shots with more imagination than pouring cold jäger in a shot glass.
-the desserts. The brownie and ice cream is so good that I'm willing to throw my calorie counter out the window and devour the thing by myself, while growling at those trying to share with me. NO SHARING!
-the TVs. Lots of them! Playing all different sports! And different teams! Not just the same game on every tv. They switch on music videos after the games are over, later in the evening. I become completely mesmerized by this and will lose at pool because of it.
-the billiards:
---On Monday nights, it's $9 unlimited all night play. Other nights is $7/hour. You can see the value there. 
---the tables are beautifully maintained.
---the cues are straight and true. All in excellent condition.
---the pool tables are appropriately spaced from the walls and tables. You never have to worry about twisting yourself in some weird shape because you're too damn close to the wall to make your shot. 
-the bartenders. They care abut you and your beers. They will come out to you while you're playing pool to see if you need a fresh drink. 

The Things that Don't Work:

-I live too far away and can't come here often enough."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but the past two times I've been there the bartenders have been so rude! They act like you're inconveniencing them. And they don't give out samples of the beers they have on tap. Flanny's gives out samples all day long and their bartenders are great... go there instead!"}
{"text":"Planned to meet some friends here for the UFC fights. We got there after the fights started and the place was very busy. Upon seeing us milling around trying to figure out what we were going to do, someone from LB, not sure if it was the owner, manager, offered to bring out some additional chairs for us to sit in an open area that would allow us to sit and watch. 

Simple gesture, but he could have easily done nothing and allowed us to just figure it out or leave as most places would have done. He did that for us and then proceeded to do the same for a number of others as they got busier. 

I have to appreciate businesses who do whatever they can to represent their establishment well and create a positive experience that results in customers wanting to go back. I know leaving tonight, I want to come back to support the business and I want to tell others to do the same. Thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"$5 Ahi tuna tacos, $4.50 wings (that are not small) for happy hour and a Coach Erickson sighting (he's apparently a partner). What more could you ask for?
I know, I know, a Coach Graham sighting.

Personally though, I've been there a few times and never saw anyone playing pool. If they got rid of all the tables but one and moved that one to the front left corner, they could make that large wood floor space a dancefloor, bring in a deejay and have a booming nightlife there as well as good food. 

That floor space is also large enough to host live local music. 

They seem to hold the service to a high level too as our waitress was excellent the first few times we came and then when our server changed things changed a bit as well. 

A promising place nonetheless that's large, has an abundance of good flatscreens, good happy hour food specials and often times good service."}
{"text":"My bf and I live right down the street so we wanted to try this place out. We had read good reviews on the burgers.  The atmosphere was pleasant and service was superb. The food was not that great. I ordered the the hot wing (hot), which were $9 for 10 wings, a little on the expensive side. My boyfriend ordered the smoke jumper burger, and a cup of chili. Our food came out in a timely manner. The wings were not very hot at all and unfortunately did not have too much flavor. The burger was very greasy, with soggy bacon and it too lacked flavor. They don't seem to season their burgers. The chili was bland and came out in a ramekin size cup, for $4.

We might try this place out again for drink and pool, but definitely not the food."}
{"text":"Awesome food... Glad I live around the corner"}
{"text":"Best and most inviting place in the area. An area of Tempe that is surprisingly lacking good bars. We have been here every Sunday during the NFL season since the place opened and we are typically here every Thursday night for the nfl game. 

Great people, great beer, great TVs, good food!"}
{"text":"As good as the food is here, I severely don't want to come back after my boyfriend and I were starving. We wanted to eat some food to fill our stomachs and the douche bag at the bar said I wasn't allowed to eat anywhere in the restaurant unles I had my ID. I have never been to a restaurant in the whole world that doesn't have a designated area to just eat! At least at like kona grill they will let you in the restaurant if you don't have your ID. So we went all the way home and came back and I was so tempted to sit at the bar and shove my ID in the bartenders face but my boyfriend was so pissed off it wouldn't have been a good idea. So we sat at the tables facing away from the bar to contain out anger from being so hungry. 
Idk if I will ever come back after this visit."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pool place in the Valley--and I am more than happy to drive across town from the West Side to get there.
Lucky Break is spacious and clean, with lots of well-maintained tables and cues. I didn't order anything to eat, so I can't speak to the quality of the food, but the drink servers were fast and friendly.
We went in on Sunday night of a three-day weekend around 8 pm and had the place nearly to ourselves (ok with us) but it definitely seemed to be picking up when we left.
Best of all, we played three games of pool, ordered one beer and one tea, and left there for under $10 including tip--pool is free Sunday through Thursday.
really nice spot."}
{"text":"Food is unique and tasty. Try the ultimate grilled cheese.  Service is poor. Three employees hang around at a table in the bar area chatting while the cook is preparing my food,  lunch came out wonderful but the front of house staff needs to find something to do and pay attention to a the few customers that are in there. I stopped in today at 1 for lunch but they changed their hours they are not open until 3 o'clock weekdays. I feel this place is going to close down quite soon. Prices for pool during promo hours are great."}
{"text":"Well I was hopeful since the new owners have taken over that this place was going to get better. It hasn't.  I stood at the bar for 10 minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge me and got no response. One waitress and one bartender on a Saturday night, neither of which ever came to our table.  I was planning on eating and drinking here but I will stop at Jack-in-the-Box on my way home.  At least the band Jaded Jukebox was good."}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite bar in Tempe! With great and friendly service and a warm atmosphere, Lucky Break just works.

I went there last night because I'd seen a few tweets mentioning the newly opened bar. It as fairly quiet and laid back but pretty soon it filled up with guys playing pool and having a laugh. Perfect. 

They've got a wide variety of beer. A tad on the pricier side but do-able. Not sure if they have a happy hour - that would be awesome.

With a ton of televisions, this place is perfect to watch the game. And if the game gets boring, go play some pool! Visit Lucky Break, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good. The beer is ice cold. The place is immaculately clean. The servers Joy and Zira are excellent. There's two dozen flat screen TVs around the room. Prices are reasonable. This may have just become my new favorite bar."}
{"text":"Arrived and was greeted by waitress in a reasonable amount of time, asked if they had pitchers, they didn't, so I asked for a minute to look over the menu while requesting waters.  Saw their drink specials menu was $3 Skyy's all day.  After asking if they had blueberry (they didn't) I ordered a Vanilla Cran (most generic girl drink ever), 5 minutes later I was informed they didn't have Vanilla.  Ok.  Ordered Pasionfruit Skyy (yuk).  My dates draft beer and my watered down Skyy came out.  We waited, and we waited. And we waited.  Finally she comes back for food orders.  We ordered Fish and chips and their pesto pasta special.  Fish came out burned, but still somehow edible, and my pasta was ok, it just wasn't good.  Had Mushrooms and Zucchini in it, and it was like HUGE slices, like two pieces of penne to 6 inches of a mushroom slice. Tasted just OK, but was hard to manage eating reasonably balanced bites and I didn't take it home with me which is saying something,  I ate less than half and DIDN'T WANT THE LEFTOVERS.  Then we had a problem with our bill and the waitress wasn't caring or understanding, so I only tipped 15% and I think that was generous.  Normally I tip 25+...   She just didn't seem to care, and I had to ask for more water when both were empty, she only brought us one more.  Normally I NEVER take out a bad place/food/ambiance on a server, but tonight she just made it worse.  I might come back to try it again, but I will stick to happy hour things which is what everyone else seemed to be doing..."}
{"text":"Pros. This is where my coworkers and i come for happy hour on Fridays. Since i
don't drink beer, I've tried a variety things off their food menu. I like their sweet potato tots with marshmallow dip. Their regular tots are pretty decent too. My favorite thing on the menu is their peanut butter thing (dessert). We usually get the same waitress. She's ditzy and a bit slow; but she always gets our orders right. She once got into a nasty verbal argument with my coworker, but we still came back the following week. Plenty of parking.

Cons: Mediocre burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Staff turned down a 18-person reservation because calling someone back is a chore. Luckily we found better. Every time I go here it's like the craft beer menu from Buffalo Wild Wings. The crowd sucks too; lots of rude youngsters who seem to have missed the transition from behavior at your friend's house whose parents aren't around, to a public setting where one should not piss off others with reckless abandon. Keep your reservations, Lucky Break."}
{"text":"This was one great laid back bar. I went for a Yelp event and arrived early due to thinking there would be more traffic on the I-10. I ended up walking around the well designed and furnished bar to see nice wood accents, clean well kept pool tables, and a happy go lucky staff that was willing to get me anything I wanted and always wore a smile. I ended up drinking a few four peaks Kilt lifters before I decided on what I wanted and maybe the overdose of carbs led me to the santa fe type chicken salad that was great. The chicken was moist and blackened with the right amount of spice and the lettuce and toppings were super fresh. After dinner I tried a few new 4 peaks creations and hopped on the nearest pool table for some after dinner fun with the brew masters. The environment was always nice, music at the right level and plenty to watch on tv including my favorite ( UFC ). When I made it back to the table there were a plethora of desserts and I could not resist trying them and on the real I am so glad I did. The brownie with vanilla bean and coffee ice cream was to die for and also the brownie cake with peanut butter. Just super mouth watering sugar-tastic goodness all around.  I would defiantly go back to this place, and will be sure to bring my friends next time I'm in the area.

Be sure to check this joint out!"}
{"text":"Order the Cobb Burger! It was delicious!  Food was great, service was ok. I've heard from other people that the service is awful but in the 3 times we've been I've never had 'awful' service.  We'll go again. Love the variety of the beers on tap."}
{"text":"Are you a pool shark? No? Cool, me either! But if you are, this is a great spot for you! It's like a sports bar meets video bar and the atmosphere is so crackin. Yeah, I said crackin! 
The beer selection is bomb dot com. If you know me like I know me, then you know I like beer. Seasonal beers on tap! 

I've never eaten hear but one of my best buds who is a burger aficionado says they really are the tits mcgee! 

Rent a table by the hour, have some brewskis and say hi to Samantha for me if you see her!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday when a bunch of college football games were on and this sports bar was very nearly empty.  It easily has room for 100 people and about 10 large screens showing games.  It's a nice place with good food so depending on what you're looking for the relative lack of people could be good or bad.

I had a burger with green chilis and jalapenos that was really tasty.  The fries were a bit dry.

The service was good, though like I said it was empty when I was there so not sure what it would be like if they were really busy."}
{"text":"Pretty  chill spot to watch the nfl games... Food is pretty good and great happy hour specials I can't think of anything bad to say"}
{"text":"3/23/13

Stopped by after the RenFaire to have a drink during happy hour, and while I didn't eat anything, I did try a pint (well, I drank about half a pint!) of Sierra Nevada Hefeweizen.  (I'm assuming it's Kellerweis, since I just purchased a six-pack from Sprout's, and the sips I've tried awhile ago tasted like what I tried here at LB.)  I can't recall the cost breakdown, but I remember thinking that the prices on  beer drafts were pretty good!  Craft for $4 or less is not too shabby...

Thank goodness it wasn't very cold indoors, like it was when Yelp held an Elite event here.  It was middle of summer, and yet I was freezing!  Today was a beautiful day, mid-70s I think, and it was very comfortable inside.  Only thing I didn't like was that it was very dark indoors at 530p.  It made me wish I was outdoors enjoying the beautiful weather!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday was my 2nd time at Lucky Break for the McGregor versus Aldo UFC Fight. I expected it to be busy, which it was, but the great quality customer service exceeded my expectations! It was packed! But our server, Nicole, was still on top of our entire group's (16 people -- which I'm in the hospitality industry & that's still quite a lot of people for a group) food & drink orders. Food came out fairly quick which I was surprised about since the whole place was filled. We tried the tots & nachos as well as a few glasses of Ace Pear Cider & Fireball on the rocks... Delicious! We had a great time -- our group made sure to go there early to get enough seats. There's no way that we could not have gotten a good view of the TVs because they have big screen TVs & projectors surrounding the whole place.

The first time we went in was on a Tuesday. A more quiet night, but that's what we wanted for date night. It's a pretty large establishment & pretty fancy decor for the location. They do Gift Card Tuesdays! We spent over $20 & received a $5 gift card to spend for the second time we went. Tried the wings & hummus & a few speciality beers that they have on tap. There's a really good coffee beer that they have right now that is probably my favorite! We really enjoyed the big smile & high quality customer service from our bartender Noelle. We felt like VIPs sitting at the bar. We will be back this week for dinner!"}
{"text":"Different name same place.  They need to redo the entire menu and cook fresh food, like French dip sandwiches, fresh wings, etc.  Everything is made with Texas Toast and just not good at all.   They need good bar food.  A place to go for a good sandwich, sports and drinks.   The beer is cold but that is about it. Sorry wont return until the menu changes and they get a new cook.  Lose the pepper shaker not everyone like pepper on everything they order.    I will stay with Doc & Eddys at least I know I will get a good sandwich and beer and or go to Mac's Broiler Room for good food and beer.   Sorry thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"I've dined here a few more times since the last review, and the food's improved. During our last visit, I had the mean green burger with sweet potato tots. The burger was a hearty patty, cooked to order (Medium rare for me), loaded with green chiles, jalapenos, and guacamole. The burger bun was lightly toasted with a light buttery taste. The sweet potato tots, while small, were nicely cooked, and the cinnamon-marshmallow sauce that went with it was amazing!

While it took a few minutes for a waitress to realize we were seated and come over, service after that was good. Drinks were refilled as needed and she checked up on us regularly.

Wednesdays are all day happy hour which include discounted burgers, drinks, and appetizers. 

Upgrade one star!"}
{"text":"Lucky Break is a lovely bar/restaurant!! My husband and I LOVE the food!! It is SO good!! I crave the ahi fish tacos-to die for!! 

Great service and good choice of beers!!

I HIGHLY recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Free pool sun - thur. Drink prices okay. Good pretty good. Wednesday all day happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is awesome, service is really good. I always have a great convo with the bar tenders. The whole look and feel of the place is totally chill. Be careful of the shuffle board table, its kinda wonky. Last time we were there, they said they were going to get it fixed."}
{"text":"Previous review was prior to name change. Things have gone down hill. Unkempt bathrooms. Broken TVs. Worse specials. Horrible TV sound."}
{"text":"I would come back here again. We just had a couple drinks and played pool. Although I don't think they should be labeled as a pool hall when there were only a couple pool tables. But I'd come back and have a drink and maybe try some food next time."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3-star bar.  I am judging this ONLY OFF THE BAR, NOT OFF THE FOOD!!!

The bartender I dealt with, Michael, was pretty cool.  I came in here with a coworker around 10pm on a Sunday night (both in town for meetings) and it was a decent experience.  The bar was clean.  Drinks were a bit pricey, but I tend to tip a little on the high side when I am drinking so I can't knock them here.  The atmosphere was a bit lacking.  No music, no ESPN or other TV noise... Kinda.. just conversation.

I am a vodka guy so I did not pay attention to much else.  They seem to be very heavily loaded on middle shelf, but not many top shelf.  I opted for Skyy, can't go wrong there.  There was a significant selection of draft beers if that is your thing...

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place.  It isn't overly impressive by any means though.  The service was good, but in essence it is the bartenders job to be responsive and cool.  The atmosphere is costing the 2 stars Lucky Break is not getting.  A giant store front window greets Baseline Road and the makeshift patio smoking section.

If I lived locally, I would probably visit every few weeks, but lacks... je ne sais quoi... Panache.  Wow... way too much French for one review!

There are a large number of video games (thought I saw Golden Tee... my weakness), about 4 pool tables, great for groups.  Maybe a busier night would be better?  Not the bartenders fault, however.  Michael rocked...."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Excellent live music with the regular band FUNK n CHAOS - wow what a musicians! - nice terrace where u can drink and smoke - really clean restrooms - staff super friendly!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. First week of NFL football and they probably need at least 5 more servers. Been sitting at a table for 25 min so far without a drink or menus or anything. Service is non existent. If it wasn't for my team on the TVs I would have left by now."}
{"text":"A very nice sports bar.  Great place to watch a game or just hang out.  They have awesome TV's.  My boyfriend is in love with their nachos because they use fresh jalapenos, which makes them pretty spicy.  I'm very excited to have such a nice sports bar so close to home."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went her after work one day. It was a really friendly place. We were welcomed by the bartenders and they kept the drinks coming. 

-The Happy Hour Specials were great, I ordered one of every appitizer. The hummus was delicious and for a bar I was shocked.
-The drinks were well made and not too over powering but enough I had to stop way in advance of driving home. 
-The bartenders were attentive, if I had an empty drink glass in front of me they were all about what to get me next.
-The locals were friendly, but not \"overly friendly.\" I have to say I appreciated that. I didn't feel like an outcast however I didn't feel like I needed to leave and bleach myself in Clorox.

I would certainly recommend this place for happy hour after work, or just relaxing on the weekends. It seems like the place to be for the area!"}
{"text":"So far, I've just been here with the family for pool and soft drinks.

This isn't a seedy pool hall--this is a sports bar and grill with pool tables, a dart machine, and more.  While most of their income, no doubt, is from cocktails and beer at the bar, you also see people here having lunch and dinner, sometimes looking up at the tv to see the Cardinals or the Diamondbacks play.

I haven't had the food yet, but the place is friendly and with a good atmosphere, so I see a point sometime soon where I'll take the family there for a meal and another game of pool.  I'll be sure to scratch on the break like I often do, but at least we'll all be having fun."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends for happy hour after work here and had a great time. The place is spacious with a number of different sized table so we had no trouble accommodating our group even though we had at least 15 people. 4 stars for the food and atmosphere. 

Happy hour gave us a steal for the wings which were delicious. It was thursday which means cheap Blue Moons all day which is a win in my book. Also they had a great assortment of pool tables and darts - hard to find in the north valley (might be more standard down in Tempe with the college crowd). 

The last star is given for management rocking out. After playing, drinking and having a great time the manager even came out and gave us a gift certificate for a future outing that gave us two .01$ drink tickets for every member of our party, free shared appetizers and two pool tables for two hours. Now, I do realize that they probably noticed how much we had spent after 6 hours in the bar but it is still way cool in my book. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went in there tonight to catch the ASU game and to have some dinner. So disappointed about how this place now appears to be going downhill.  The service was atrocious.  After being there at least 10 minutes another waiter told my waiter that I hadn't been waited on. The guy appeared to be put out because he was enjoying his conversation with a friend at the bar.  I had a burger and it was cooked beyond well done.  Because the waiter never bothered to come back and check on me after my food was there I finally ended up eating it instead of sending it back since it was at least 10 minutes between visits to our table. Bad food and bad service is no way to stay in business."}
{"text":"They have a veggie burger!
Build it your own with lots of options.
I get the green chili veggie burger with jalapeños on Texas toast and it's delish!
Several pool tables.
Lots of screens to get your sports fix. 
Live music.
Trivia.
And a Galaga video game!
Someone get a ping pong table for this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Around 8 PM on Friday July 29 2018.  We waited over 15 minutes for a waitress to come over to get our order.  This is after waiting another five minutes after I went up to the bar to ask the  bartender if they had severs to wait on people 

He said  yes I'll send one right over.  We kind of got excited when a waitress headed our way but then she turned waited on another table then went back to the back of the bar and proceeded to do a shot

Sorry cannot recommend this place.  Service horrible

They need to get employees that want to serve"}
{"text":"Worst service in years.  We ordered bourbon and codes.  When we got the bill she did not give us an itemized bill, only the amount.  When I asked for the details I see she charged me for high end bourbon and the charges separately for coke.

Are you getting me???"}
{"text":"I loved lucky break.. But scullys is a huge disappointment. We waited for 30 minutes for any kind of service and asked at least 3 times for service. I got a burger that was supposed to have smoked Gouda on it and instead it had shredded cheddar and was almost raw. My friend asked for hot dog toppings on the side and they were all on the dog plus extra stuff not supposed to be on it. Server didn't know what beers were on tap. I'm sad. At least the sweet potato tots were still there."}
{"text":"I will premise this review by noting that there were only 2 other people in the place when I arrived.  And that is the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars, becasue I would like to see how everything is when they are busier.

With that said, I ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and an Iced Tea.  The bartender talked me into adding ham to the sandwich, and informed me that this sandwich came with a cup of Tomato Bisque Soup.

Ordered placed and in about 7 minutes my food arrived.

The Tomato Bisque Soup was out of this world, I could have eaten just that for a meal.  But, I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't, the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Ham was also very, very good.  I would say that I will definitely order this again, but I can't say that because the rest of the menu has me wanting to try other items.

Overall, this was a great experience . . . and . . . I will definately be returning."}
{"text":"We come to Lucky Break every Friday for Trivia. Its great. We meant some great people and the host is great also. Food is good. Its better than it use to be and you can tell the owners are trying to make to best of what they have going. Service could be a tad bit better but that will come in time, I hope. Overall good local bar if you live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went here for some after work drinks and I can say confidently that I will never return. The service was terrible. Faith was our server and we ended up having to go to the bar and order our drinks for the majority of the night because she was nowhere to be found. I knew it would be a bad experience when I ordered a red sangria and she brought me a white. It wouldn't have been a big deal if she wouldn't have tried to convince me that she was right and that I was wrong. I simply declined the drink because white wine makes me ill and told her to not worry about it. She remained absent until it was time to order food. We got our food with no silver wear. Once again we had to ask the bar for anything we needed for the remainder of the night and ended up with a confusing bill with 9 shots that didn't belong. Seriously this was a mess."}
{"text":"BIGGEST BURGER IN TOWN! 

Yes these burgers are huge! Portion size will not disapoint, ladies eat half for dinner and you have half for lunch the next day when you can't leave the office! 
Nice thick fries too! 
Place is very nice looking inside! 
Plenty to do inside, pool tables and video games, not to mention all the big screens! 
Wish we lived closer this would be our hang out!"}
{"text":"Finally somewhere in my neighborhood that has good craft beer and atmosphere!! Inside looks completely different from the outside. Its large but still welcoming inside. Pool tables, tv's all over the place, booth seating and of course bar seating.

Happy hour every day until 7pm !! I tried the hummus and devoured the whole thing along with my Guinness.  Good prices and good service.

You will see me here again, it's a given.

They have beer flights."}
{"text":"This used to be a really great neighborhood bar until it came under new management. I've tried giving it a chance multiple times and have been utterly disappointed each time. The most recent time the service was the worst I've ever had. The bar was understaffed and I viewed being ignored due to the fact that I was here with my husband to watch a game and not whatever event they had going on. We were eventually served and then immediately ignored again. The food was cold and missing elements that we asked for. On top of all of that our server was leaving so she closed us out at 3:55. The game wasn't over until 5:30. In that time not once did a server come to ask us if we needed anything. I will absolutely never come back here and will make sure that none of my work happy hours are held here again."}
{"text":"I had a blast at Lucky Break. The happy hour specials are really good for large sharable appetizers and drinks. It's close to my apartment which is something I value when trying to get a drink close by before going home. The staff was very friendly and kept our drinks full. I like how there's something for everyone. You can watch sports, play pool, play video games, talk with friends, have drinks and all feel like they belong. 

Downfalls:
The pipes in the restroom smell nasty. Similar taste in the drinking water."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. The menu has changed and is now your typical mediocre bar food. Service is awful the bartender needs to tie her hair back, I saw it touching the ice as she scooped a cup full. She also left our food on the bar when we had asked her if we could move outside so it was cold by the time we got it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for fun....the food was GREAT...had the chili cheese tots....awesome.  The burgers were tasty and seasoned well.   We will go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is so beyond crappy now ! I liv across the street and used to love to come here . We came tonight to watch the asu game with a group of people. Our server was  all over the place and had way to many tables . I ordered a burger medium rare with tatter tots and when I got the food the burgers was well done with fries . The food tasted horrible ... like I get it I shouldn't expect much from bar food but come on it's not that hard to make a medium rare burger .overall they have gone down hill so bad that's why it's been under 3 different owners in the last few years .  I love so close and hate coming here now the service sucks the food sucks and the entire experience sucks only good thing they have is massive tvs everywhere ..,"}
{"text":"This has been one of my go-to locals since it opened.  There's a good selection of liquor behind the bar but the real attraction is the fifteen or so local and national microbrews on tap.  The prices are very reasonable and they have good happy hour deals every day of the week.  They don't pull the old happy hour bait and switch where happy hour only applies to American macros - they also knock some of the price of their bounty of delicious micros.

The hamburgers are certainly solid, but nothing special.  They do get points for creativity as they have some burger creations I've only seen here.  Unfortunately the wings her are just not up to snuff, so I would stay away from them.  I've also tried the nachos which were mediocre.

There are giant flat screens televisions plastered all over the walls in the dining area, bar, and around the pool tables, so it's a great place to fuel your attention deficit sports fandom and follow multiple games on college football Saturdays or NFL Sundays.  I've never been in here when it's hard to get a table or at least a seat in the bar during game days.  The interior design of the bar is very modern with lots of wood paneling and black leather booths.

I'd say Lucky Break kills it as a casual day-drinking sports bar with real beer on draft."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I hate writing negative reviews.  And although I do have some positives to touch on (hence the 3 stars) I must hound on 1 crucial point...customer service, customer service, customer service!!!  This was my 3rd time back to Lucky Break, all spread out by apx. 3 months or so and every time we received awful, rude-ish (is that a word?) service....specifically from the bartenders.  I definitely don't expect red carpet, top notch, amazing service from a local bar, but I do expect friendly, welcoming service.  It feels like the bartenders are put out by having to serve you.  I have been there when it is busy and when it is slow, and it is the same elitist, unwelcoming service every time.

On the positive side...the beer selection on tap is great, with super cold glasses to accompany them, good food options (even some healthy options) for a sports bar, specials every day, lots of pool tables and other misc. games.  We really REALLY want to like this place, but are so let down by the service every time (sigh)."}
{"text":"I came here twice in the last few weeks, the first just for drinks and the second for drinks and happy hour food. The drinks here are solid and happy hour is good. Their marg was pretty standard, but at only 4$ on special, I liked it a lot. Their sangria is fairly tasty, sweet, but good. The food, however, was not good. The first trip we saw the food and it looked delish, but upon eating it, not so much. We shared the chicken quesadilla, very bland and boring.... not awesome. The service is generally good and they have electronic trivia (woohoo!). I would go back for happy hour drinks, but skip the food."}
{"text":"Lucky break was a welcome surprise I'm the strip mall with the china buffet and gun shop. My first time I was pleasantly surprised by the craft beer list, and on subsequent visits the food has also been a welcome surprise. Sure it's not much from the outside but when you venture inside, good bar food, tons of TVs, and a nice local craft beer lineup await. Go on taco Tuesday and get the cod tacos- awesome. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bartender was ill-informed. A friend asked about a hoppy IPA. He had little knowledge because he didn't like IPAS. Failed to even identify the only double IPA on tap. Personal preference is not bartending. 

He was playing games on his phone instead of taking care of our checks. 

Not friendly or even conversational. No
\"How are you\" or \"welcome.\" The bar was empty - may my friends and I feel good. 

I walked into the women's restroom- and was greeted by a MAN and two women who were \"talking.\" They should have been thrown out. I shouldn't have to ask a man to leave to I may use the women's restroom. 

On a plus, he did card us and he did wipe down bottles and the bar. But!! Left the bucket sanitizer under the taps where it easily could have been mixed into my beer."}
{"text":"Very nice place with excellent service! Variety of places to sit and numerous TV's, so everywhere is a good spot. Everyone is polite. Cheap happy hour prices! I will most defiantly be coming here!"}
{"text":"We came to play trivia but had an awful waitress who couldn't get any orders straight and never came too fill up drinks. My friend's order came 1 hour 20 minutes late. I had to go to the bar to get drink refills. Even after talking to the manager, it still took it my friend a while to get his food. Had a hamburger that was covered with heavy black pepper. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Thanks so much Lucky Break for the terrific Thursday night fun. Our party of eight thoroughly enjoyed visiting. Pool, shuffleboard, spin the wheel, ice-cold beer, throwback cocktails, terrific appies (especially the garlic fries) and unbelievably friendly service made this visit a treat. You have become my new favorite neighborhood bar. Can't wait for Sunday morning football breakfasts too!!"}
{"text":"Went there to hear Carvin Jones which was great - fabulous - waited 40 minutes and no server so we went up to the bar and got our own drinks - waited another 40 minutes and went up and ordered our 2nd drink there 2 hours and never knew who our server was - we never got a menu so we left and went elsewhere to eat - you have carvin Jones playing and you don't have adequate servers - it's insanity ' what else can one say - dk"}
{"text":"Well, I hate to say it, I probably won't be back for food.

I should be finishing up my Thanksgiving prep right now, but instead I am in bed after experiencing intestinal distress.  I ate here a couple hours ago and for the second time after eating here, I am sick to my stomach.

Add to that, my MIL's burger did not come out as she ordered it (came with standard Brie instead of the Swiss substitution she made).  

Then my pesto primavera was extremely oversauced.  I mean, I picked out the veggies and could not really eat anything else.  It was drowning.  It came with a small slice of red onion.  They also left off the parmesan crisp, which is fine because even though I am giving myself a cheat weekend... I didn't need to eat any extra dairy.  

I feel like Lucky Break should host a panel of Yelpers to help them just fine tune their offerings.  They have so much potential, but the food just doesn't come out of the kitchen like it COULD.  

I love the ambience here.  I love the beer selection.  I love that it is locally owned.  I just can't chance that I will get sick every other time I eat here (after not even enjoying my dish).

The service was just fine today, even if a tad slow because it was a busy night.  No complaints there.

I may come back for beers some day, but I have to say... the cooks need some assistance.

Oh - and don't play the Tractor game because it will eat your kid's dollar and when you tell the waitress, she will just offer to unplug it.  Then the game will shock her, so she will leave it plugged in.  More kids will lose their money because they were not warned.  Or at least that is what happened tonight. ;)

I am leaving them at 3 stars even though I WANT to give them 2 because they are really, really nice people and there are some great things here.  Pool is a great price and the beer selection, as I mentioned before, rocks."}
{"text":"I've been dying to find another local watering hole to satisfy my love of good food, cheap booze and pool.  Who would have thought such a place would open up next to one of my favorite Chinese buffets in Tempe?  I've now been there 3 times and need to do my damnedest to spread the word.  

First off, the space is modern, inviting and completely open.   Their are TVs everywhere with a long bar running down the left side.  The pool tables make up the back right section of the space and I love the modern and open vibe of the space, complete with wood accented walls and wood floors.  The pool tables are well maintained as are the sticks.  

Their food is exceptional and diverse.  I highly recommend the Monte Twisto with a side of sweet potato tater tots.  The sandwich is big, cheesy and delicious.  The sweetness of the tots is well balanced by the crispy outside.  Also, the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with smoked Gouda puts a great spin on an old classic.  I opted to add bacon and tomatoes and was not disappointed.  It comes with a side of Green Chile Tomato Bisque; don't opt out because the Bisque is thick, creamy and spicy.  I have also had Chorizo Fondue and Chorizo Chili and like them, but wish the chorizo was spicier....much spicier! 

Now for the booze.  They have daily happy hour from 3-7 with great deals.  I would venture to say they are the best deals in S. Tempe.  More importantly, they have daily deals, saving all of us worker bees from having to cut out too early from work on a Friday.  Friday's drink deal is $3 Pinnacle Whipped Vodka drinks.  I order mine with OJ to make a creamsicle.  

The bottom line...I hope to continue coming here until old age.

**Tip 1**

Friday is $3 pints of Sonoran White Chocolate Ale....oops, scratch that.  They switched it out for Lumberyard Raspberry Ale, which is really good BUT.....bring back the White Chocolate because it goes great with Root Beer.

**Tip 2**

They have a nice sized, sectioned off patio for you to lock up your bike.  Yes, we will make this a stop on our next bars on bikes!!!"}
