{"text":"Cleveland's newest BBQ spot right across from the Beachland Ballroom.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the new Blitz BBQ three times now and (admittedly) ordered the same exact thing all three times. I have enjoyed the Jerk Chicken dinner with a side of baked beans and a side of cole slaw. The chicken is well smoked and tastes even better dipped in the bbq sauce made on-site. Price seems about right and the owner seems friendly. Super clean and right across from the Beachland!"}
{"text":"We tried to get a bite to eat before a show at the Beachland Ballroom on Friday night. Place looked good, couple guys in there eating some yummy-looking burgers. Walked in and stood at the counter for literally 10 mins it more without ever being acknowledged. There was one guy working in the kitchen. All he had to do look up, say \"I'll be right with you\". But it was almost as if he was deliberately avoiding eye contact. 
It became awkward. So we walked out. Had burgers across the street at the Tavern. They were good!"}
