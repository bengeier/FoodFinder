{"text":"This place is great!  a few small tables, nothing fancy and clean. It seemed they had a lot of carry out. The Owner/Chef was very friendly and the food was great! We ordered a small serving of Hummus and it was delicious and plenty to share with someone. We also order Falafel, it was just okay and I've had better. We also thought 5 in an order for 8.99 was a little over priced.  My husband had the Mezza Gyro and I had the Souvlaki. They were both delicious and came with some chopped up lettuce and homemade pickled turnips on the side. The pickled turnips were good too. The pita was one of the best ones I've had, they were loaded with meat. I tried some of my husbands Gyro meat and it was great! You could actually taste the meat and not just all the spices. We live a good 50 minutes from this place and would eat there again in a minute. It's worth the stop!"}
{"text":"My favorite gyro place! Love the little grocery store inside. Lots of great Mediterranean items for purchase. Delicious hummus!"}
{"text":"Great local bussiness! Went and ordered tons of different foods so I could try them all. Best gyro I ever had! Service was family style. Small but good food and great service made up for it."}
{"text":"Nice people, very helpful, clean, bright. Take out and about ten tables of four. I had a basic gyro with fries and soda to go. I had high expectations but thought it was just OK and pricier than indicated. Gyro was good, nice size, although I like mine wrapped tight, not loose. Fries were good, fresh made with nice seasoning. Add a soda and I was over ten bucks which was on the high side for lunch for me."}
{"text":"My fiance and I received a gift card to Mezza from a friend as an engagement gift. We went this past weekend, right as the restaurant opened on Saturday.   We were pleasantly greeted by a woman (owner?) who took our order and very thoughtfully made our meals: mezza gyro for my fiance and chicken gyro for me, both with fries. You could tell she really cared about making the food. She even brought us out samples of a new chickpea salad they had added to the menu and asked for our opinions on it. She seemed delighted to see how happy we were with our food!  The restaurant was clean and the food was awesome - I was a big fan of the tzatziki! I was sort of hoping the fries would be fresh cut versus store bought, but for me fries are pretty delicious regardless!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.  It's tucked away in a strip mall, but definitely worth the trip.  Quite possibly the best Gyro I've ever eaten.  Large portion size and incredible flavor.  I highly recommend Mezza to anyone in the mood for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in town. The sizes of the portions ensure you're well-fed. The owner & chef is the sweetest lady ever!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but a little bland in certain things like the hummus. The service was very prompt and the staff was polite and the store was spotless."}
{"text":"great, quick little place to grab a bite. awesome Mediterranean food. gotta get the gyros. Has a little grocery section too with great cheeses and pastries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  This place is great.  Everyone is very friendly and I believe is a family owned place.  The food is awesome.  I've had the gyro as well as the chicken shawarma.  They never disappoint. The grocery section is cool as well. I highly recommend this restaurant for someone who wants to try something new."}
{"text":"Very expensive Poor ventilation Falafel sandwich for 8$, take away .... You feel that you were the cook when you leave. I don't think I'll go again"}
{"text":"I'm buying stretchy pants and ordering one of everything on the menu. This place is awesome.   We just moved in around the corner and popped in tonight for takeout.   We split Heaven on a Gyro and a Chicken Gyro.   Both were amazing. Crisp lettuce, juicy tomatoes, tasty chicken and Gyro meat and the sauce...stop it.   Give me a five gallon bucket, a ladle, dark room and some old clothes.   I'm eating the whole thing.  (Is that weird?) Best ever. Hidden gem. Tucked away and incredible food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best Gyros in the Greater Cleveland Area! Nothing more to say but go get one!  Inside seating and Take Out."}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to Urban Spoon.  I was looking for something different for lunch, and boy did I find it!   I looked over the menu, and what better dish to try at a Mediterranean place than the burger of the med, the Gyro.  I went with the Hummus Gyro, and holy cow.  This thing was as big as my head!  The meat was tender and delicious.  It blew my mind because it filled me up and it only cost $6.99.  Are you kidding me?  I have had crappy gyros that were twice as expensive and half a big.    If you are in the mood for a good gyro, head here!  Definitely."}
{"text":"Another great place for lunch discovered in Westlake, thanks to yelp. They are a good eight minute drive from my place of employment, so I am just now getting around to trying this place. Let me tell you, it was worth the drive. Delicious gyro's, great, accurate service, authentic Mediterranean eats, yummo.  The gyro's are just delicious, the appetizers are all worth every penny and the wraps are cravable, and are now part of my regular rotation. I had the 'wicked chicken pita,' green peppers, cheese and a spicy sauce, wrapped in a crispy pita, better than chipotle! The salads are big, meaty and fresh. Only thing that I didn't care for, the grape leaves are served in a soupy, broth like sauce. Next time I will say, just grape leaves, no sauce (or juice, or whatever that was). The grape leaves themselves were good, so close to what I get at home from my genius of a grandma (or Yaiyai in Greek).  What a great value, we had placed a pick up order for my five closest friends at work, every single one of us were very impressed and happy with everything. Pricing ranges from $7 to $10, but if you're experience is anything like mine, I'd pay much more!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. I've been looking for some new places to have lunch without breaking the bank. There's only a couple of things on the menu that I would actually try. I had the wicked chicken wrap and it was delicious!! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"What a great find, in a nondescript strip mall!  The owners told me they'd been there for  more than a dozen years.  I brought a bunch of co-workers for our monthly foodie adventure, and this spot did not disappoint.  We shared a few dishes around the table along with gyros for each of us.  For starters, we had stuffed grape leaves, roasted red pepper hummus and baba ghanouj.  The stuffed grape leaves were served warm with a dill yogurt sauce that was a perfect compliment to the lemony lamb and rice stuffing. Both the roasted red pepper hummus and baba ghanouj were slightly chunky and spiced just right, served with cut-up pita bread.  The gyros were huge and delicious with twice-grilled meat and a great, tangy tzatziki sauce.  The meat carved off of the spit was placed back on their flattop grill to put a slight char on them and to warm the meat back up.  Unique idea for a gyro I had never seen before.  They also gave us a plate of complimentary pickled vegetables that were super-briny yet crispy and were a nice addition to the meal.  Super-friendly owners, fresh-made food and dishes to share...a great experience all around.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've been missing this place this whole time! Heard about this place from Riya's salon, let me just say the gyro meat is delicious it's so flavorful and authentic. I ordered the gyro salad and asked for rice on top also. It is so good the stuffed grape leaves with garlic sauce was delicious the leaves were tender and perfect. I also ordered the torshi it's pickled vegetables and it tastes like the torshi my Persian grandma makes! This place is a gem! Definitely my new favorite Mediterranean restaurant. You can dine in or takeout which is what I did. I can't believe how authentic everything tasted. The Mast-o-Khiar (cucumber yogurt dip) was great with the mint in it, I put it on the salad it's amazing. Staff was helpful and friendly definitely a must try if you like Persian food."}
{"text":"Cooked fresh, big portions, lots of good vegetarian options. Decor inside isn't amazing... but is very clean. Also has some snacks (hummus / pita chips etc) in a mini grocery section. I had the eggplant pita which was excellent. Service was pleasant and not too slow considering the one woman operation, and their baklava was excellent!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before? This place was so delicious! Hummus was outstanding, gyro was so satisfying, and fattoush salad was one of the best I've ever had- the chicken on the salad was so tasty! I also got a delicious cookie pack to go and saw some of my favorite specialty foods in the store area of the restaurant. Very friendly staff. I will see you guys soon I am sure, great job!"}
{"text":"I had just learned about this establishment through the reviews of fellow yelpers, and their reviews are spot on!  I was really surprised to see that besides being an eatery they also have a small section of their store set up as a grocery.  Basically, it's a few coolers stocked with their wonderful hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, and other freshly prepared products.  You can get all of your basic greek/mediterranean fixings like grape leaves, feta, and a really impressive selection of ground spices.  They have a wonderful array of desserts to stuff down your gullet, too.  Now onto the food.  The gyro I ordered was really good.  Great portion size, and the tzatziki sauce was heavenly!  You can tell they use the very freshest of yogurt to make this sauce.  (I ended up going back the following day and buying a tub of it in the grocery section!)  I had also ordered the baba ganoush, and it had a great creamy consistency of pureed eggplant and scrumptious garlicky goodness.    While waiting for my food I was able to strike up a conversation with one of the proprietors and she explained to me that everything is done on the premises - save for some of the packaged/imported foods.  And there's no denying her claim either.  I was even able to take a peak into the kitchen, and it was immaculately spotless. Always a great sign.  My next visit will focus explicitly on the falafal - and you can bet that there'll be an update from me on those.  While the dining area isn't anything to write home about as it consists of some tables with plastic table covers the main point to keep in mind is that you're there for the food.  The food here is the star.  By the time I was walking out the door I couldn't help be feel like I was parting ways with a new extension of my family.  Wonderful people making wonderful food.  And at the end of the day those are the main ingredients to any amazing meal."}
{"text":"Lovely little place set back in a little shopping plaza.  The gyro is wonderful; one of the best I've had.  The \"regular\" sized gyro is huge. When I forget to order the smaller one, I've always got the \"terrible\" problem of trying to finish it.  Hummus is perfect and flavorful. We have also had the grape leaves...mmm.   The place is also a mini store, with tables to the front by the windows. Very casual.  The folks that work there have always been friendly and helpful.   I've brought a few lucky friends here who have loved it. I try to swing by for a quick take out gyro whenever possible."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried I've liked they have great gyros and really good chicken shawarma"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros and awesome hummas!!!  What more do you want!!!  Nice and Clean Establishment.  Also, very well priced and they give you a ton of food.    By Far the best Gyro on the Westside of Cleveland.    The only problem is there location, its a little hidden, but well worth the trip!  Try the Mezza Gryo and Roasted Red Pepper Hummus"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this tucked away gem in Westlake!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to downgrade a star; we've been to Mezza many times since the first review and maybe every third time, the gyro meat is overcooked and dried out.  And the fries are awful, basically the kind your mom used to pull out of the freezer and throw on a baking sheet in the oven.  When the meat is cooked properly, these gyros are bangin', though.  Do yourself a favor and stop for fries at BK or McD's on the way home."}
{"text":"Wanted so badly to like this place- it seemed quaint & authentic. I ordered the grape leaves which are okay but came in some weird juices and were soaked/ falling apart but the fattoush salad was the worst I ever had. It was an Americanized fattoush smothered in dressing and was just awful. The veggies were fresh enough and all but just no. Also, their garlic and yogurt sauce is way too runny and tastes as though they add something sweet to them both. I got grilled chicken on it which wasnt horrible and somewhat flavorful but just didn't cut the mustard. Guess I needed to order a gyro. Drive 20 minutes and get the real deal at Nate's Deli on W 25th. Disappointed...."}
{"text":"I love Gyro's! Mezza Mediterranean does not disappoint. I love their lamb meat and tzatziki sauce. The meat does not seem like the same processed meat that is served at most other gyro joints. Good crispy fries. The restaurant is is pleasant and not like your average gyro establishments. The staff is always pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"yummy and fast.  I was starving and needed something healthy to eat.this was perfect.  Get it to go, or eat in.  Fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma with I side of fries the other day. The wrap was amazing and by far one of the best things I've ever eaten. The fries were disappointing I though t for 3.99 I ought to get a heaping bile of fries but instead got a small handful. I'd definitely go back for the wrap but wouldn't ever order fries again."}
{"text":"You can very easily drive by and not know this gem of a place exists.  That's exactly what I've done for many years until I discovered it by word of mouth.  Let me tell you, if you are craving for as close to an authentic gyro on the west side, this place is a must visit. Other awesome flavors include the Hummus gyro. This is the combination of two of the best items they have - Hummus & Gyro.    By foregoing the 'show-sha' and fancy decor, Mezza offers the fire works effect for your culinary taste buds. while you wait peruse the Greek & Egyptian themed paintings on the wall and the mini-market style food isle.   For goodness sake bring some of their in store made Hummus home."}
{"text":"Tasty Chicken shwarma sandwhich, had a nice kick. Companion had a falfel sandwich and discribed it as perfectly prepared and the house-made pickeled turnips were a bonus.  Would have been five stars if they offerd soup."}
{"text":"Soooooo overpriced. Talking $3-$4 per entree overpriced. Super nice staff, clean, food is what you'd expect. No different than a regular gyro shack. But man it was pricey."}
{"text":"I travel to Cleveland for work and eat here almost every time that I do. We have tried a few Mediterranean places in the area and this is my favorite and also the most reasonably priced. I've tried a number of dishes and have never been disappointed, it all tastes authentic and delicious. My favorites recently have been their salads, which are enormous and have generous amounts of gyro meat or shawarma. The owner is friendly, and the restaurant is always clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Mezza is excellent, authentic Mediterranean food.  It truly is a hidden gem over in Westlake.  I love everything from here but my favorite is the Chicken Club.  It's a chicken pita with bacon and two types of cheese and mayo and lettuce.  I wish I knew the seasoning they used on their chicken because I would make it daily.  so GOOD.  The owner is also extremely friendly - she talks to each customer like she truly appreciates their business.  Only downfall is your clothes may stink a little when dining in, due to the kitchen being right in the middle of the plafe.  I usually get carryout."}
{"text":"Very generous portions and also delicious. Got the mezza gyro and my dad got the hummus gyro and we shared a tabouli appetizer. Its probably a good thing I don't live near this place because my waistline would hate me."}
{"text":"My husband recently discovered this place and went for lunch a few times.  He brought home the tabouli and it was really good so I suggested he get takeout tonight.  I got my usual favorite, fattoush salad.  This was not great.  The vegetables were fresh and crunchy but the dressing tasted like super oily Italian or Greek store bought dressing with some sumac thrown in.  Also, the pita chips were not packaged separately so by the time i ate it at home they were pretty soggy.    My husband says the gyros look amazing so I'm sure we'll be back to try them but I'll skip the fattoush salad next time."}
{"text":"To me, there's nothing like a proper gyros. Mezza did not disappoint!  I'm not sure what an authentic gyros tastes like, but my grandfather and I used to scour Cleveland as self-proclaimed gyros connoisseurs. Along the way, we met a couple of the shop owners, one of them a gentleman straight from Greece. Now, I've never been to Greece to taste an authentic gyros for myself, but Mezza's are very close to the prior mentioned gentleman's gyros, and that's close enough for me. Bonus points: they serve gyros with fries inside of them (Heaven on a Pita), which from what I'm told is an authentic serving style.   The meat itself is out of this world. But that takes a back seat because...they make their own Tzatziki sauce!  I repeat, homemade. Tzatziki. sauce. It's so good, and if you're a fan of Greek food it's something you have to try for yourself. Super fresh with chunks of cucumber. My mouth is watering just typing this review. The serving sizes are appropriate (read: huge) for the price.   The menu also donned a hummus gyro and the Nutty Jelly gyro, which is a gyro with peanut butter and jelly. I must go back at some point to try both of these items, although it will be hard to ever pass up that fresh Tzatziki."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It is the best Mediterranean food in cleveland, heck in akron, heck youngstown, canton and detroit have nothing  on this place. The food is amazing. Fresh and homemade from a spotless kitchen often by the owners themselves. Brings back  memories of Jacovs's from the east side. Just amazing. You would be a fool to not try this if you are anywhere near the cleveland area."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food for reasonable prices! The hummus was a bit more bitter than I like, but the food was overall very good. I got a hummus chicken with tahini and tzatziki sauce on the side. My better half got a spicey wrap of some sort (chicken) that she really liked.   The dining room was clean and open. I enjoyed sitting and relaxing for a few minutes during lunch. Our food was brought to our table - nice touch! Overall, I would say that this is a great place for lunch on a fairly small budget."}
{"text":"What a gem of a Mediterranean Restaurant!  My wife and I dined there tonight and was graced with a fine conversation with Mona, the owner and Chef.  We were filled in on the 13 year history of this family restaurant, and could not believe that it had slipped by us all that time!  I had the Mezza Gyro (pictured) and my wife ordered the Chicken Shawarma.  Both were outstanding!  The first thing you will notice about the Mezza Gyro is the amount of thick sliced gyro meat included.  It would be a meal for 2 or 3 at other restaurants.  It is perfectly seasoned, and the Tzatziki Sauce compliments with the freshness of the tomato, red onion and lettuce.  A fresh pita wraps it all up.  The restaurant is counter service with an open kitchen where you get the bonus of seeing Chef Mona practicing her art.  Table seating is available after ordering.  They have a few display racks with hard to find Mediterranean spices and ingredients. A nice touch for some of us trying to master this cuisine at home.  You will not be disappointed at Mezza!"}
{"text":"What an excellent find!  This place is perfect as just a little deli type of joint.  I had the mezza gyro and it was amazing!!  It was huge and the meat was tender, the tzatziki sauce is clearly home made and the best I have ever had.  The back of the place is a little Mediterranean market with all kinds of spices and pastry you can purchase."}
{"text":"Great hummus!!! This isn't the buttery Lebanese style hummus, rather, it has a coarser texture that is more than made up for with its bright, balanced lemony, garlicky, tahini flavor.   They also have mind blowing chicken shwarma-- very moist, marinated in spices. Mon cher chou had the chicken crisp-- basically shwarma meat in 2 pitas, pressed in a pannini grill until it is a crispy middle eastern chicken quesadilla. My daughter's meat pie was fresh and nicely seasoned. Great value for the money.   The reason they get 5 stars is their grape leaves. Most places make stuffed grape leaves as thick as a child's thigh wrapped entirely too many layers of improperly blanched leaves. THIS place makes delicate meat and rice grape leaves rolled as thin as your pinky finger in only the most delicate leaves. Add their thick tzatziki sauce, and you have heaven.   There is a great little grocery store and deli in the back, providing a well edited selection of middle eastern basics. The family who runs the place is fantastically friendly, warm and helpful. They also cater (they make boxed lunches for my daughter's school!)   Atmosphere-- there really isn't any, but with food like this, who cares?"}
{"text":"Small restaurant/grocery tucked away in an unassuming shopping plaza  in Westlake.  Hands down the best Gyros I have had in Cleveland.  They are roughly the size of a football and delicious.  Keep in mind, these are not the typical greasy spoon, coming home from the bar gyros (which certainly have their place), these are artfully prepared, proudly served high end gyros.  The homemade pita chips and red pepper hummus are excellent as well."}
{"text":"The gyro meat is amazing but the thing lacking was the tahini sauce to go with it. The sauce added was almost like a mayo and didn't impress. Still I might visit the place again just for that succulent gyro meat."}
{"text":"More of a Western influenced based place with the more popular Mediterranean dishes. Im a sucker for a cozy feel to a place when I step in it. Here, not so much. In felt unwanted, the food, however was very fresh, so I cannot  complain too bad. Still...."}
{"text":"I've gone here three times and can not leave here withput spending $60.00 for a family of four. It is entirely my fault. I go for gyros and like a past reviewer I  come out with fries, grape leaves, hummus, homemade pita from the freezer (outstanding). My only complaint is one I have with many places, too salty! The meat is very salty. Oh, and the time is always an issue. 20+min. for four sandwiches w/extras."}
{"text":"My mother and I visited Mezza yesterday for the first time (on a whim...our original destination closes on Mondays) and we were impressed.  The hummus was outstanding...thick, lemony, and delicious.  We also shared the grape leaves, which are served warm.  The gyro was huge and fantastic: the pita was crisp, the meat was flavorful, tender, and well-seasoned.  I'm sad that I live out-of-state most of the year, because I definitely crave Mediterranean food like this!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and fresh Mediterranean food!  The gyros are huge, flavorful, and filled to capacity! I really like their stuffed grape leaves and fresh hummus and taboleh! So fresh and seasoned just right.  I've never had a bad meal here and I've always left with a full belly!  Mezza is more of a fast casual type of restaurants - you place your order at the counter and pay, grab a drink from the cooler behind you, have a seat and they'll bring your fresh food out to you. Service with a smile! :)  The owner's name is Mona and she's sweet as can be!  The employees are very nice and make you feel welcome.  I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bad meal here.  If you love Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, or have a craving for a bangin' gyro, stop by Mezza!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The gyros are awful, not gyros at all... Super thick and dry... The fattoush didn't have crispy pita, literally the whole point of a fattoush, and the felafel was super dense and garlic-y. Never again."}
