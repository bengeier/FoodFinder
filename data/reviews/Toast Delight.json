{"text":"The owner is very nice. I ordered a green tea waffle but there was no green tea taste at all, just tasted like a normal flavour."}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem because of the food and the couple who own the place. Its a great snack place with many different flavour options for a fair price. The couple who own and run the little shop are very nice and easy going. I always enjoy the apple pie egg waffle with ice cream. Smells heavenly!"}
{"text":"Been seeing pics on instragram and Always wanted to try this place out. I am a downtown girl and I do not have a car so it is kind of far for m to travel all the way uptown just for the egg waffle. I was super excited to hear they they have a booth at a food event downtown called 'Sweetery'.  I went with my friend and for 2 of their egg waffles. The green tea red bean one for $6 and the pork floss & seaweed one for $5. Finally got my order after waiting for 30 mins, couldn't wait to try it...!!! Took a bite and yuck! Didn't like it at all  it was nice and fresh when I got my order but I just didn't like the batter at all...there were too much batter so the whole thing was kind of soggy and even the outside wasn't crunchy. Was kind of disappointed. Had the red bean one first and it was still okay but the pork floss one was a total disappointed, only had a few and had to throw the rest out. I prefer the HK style egg waffles at bang bang ice cream over this. Maybe they do a better job at their store up in Unionville but after trying it out at the food event downtown im glad I didn't bus all the way uptown just for it."}
{"text":"Passed here on my way out of t and t. Pretty decent egg waffles and really nice people"}
{"text":"Love this place! We drop by whenever we're in the area and feeling indulgent. The smell of egg waffles waft through the second floor as you go up the escalator. The flavour selection is huge but my new favourite is the nutella!! So yummy."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for egg waffles. I love trying all their different flavours. My favourite flavours are the ube and the cheese&pepperoni. The sweet and salty is a surprise but really good."}
{"text":"This place is SO good.  Owners were super nice. Egg waffles tasted AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Located upstairs in the tnt condo plaza hidden is this egg waffles and ice cream gem.. though the price is a lot more then the regular egg waffles toast delight has so many flavours you can choose from not to mention customizing waffles and ice cream flavours of your choice!"}
{"text":"The owners of this little shop are super duper nice! They have such a large variety of flavours to choose from and I'm always leaving feeling very satisfied!!! My favourite so far is the Ferraro Rocher Thai ice cream. The pizza egg waffles are very interesting and are a must try! My family and I are hooked and will definitely be returning for more!!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place was a no go...  Perhaps i ordered too many waffles (4) so they ended up not being super fluffy and soft because they sat out while we waited for the rest to be made?   I dont know but i was 100% disappointed, def not comparable to the pmall/ market village ones. However the pork floss & seaweed and the green tea were actually pretty good in flavour..    But to say the least, i only came here cuz woofles and cream are closed on mondays."}
{"text":"been here twice and always had such a pleasant experience! it's a family-owned business and they provide really friendly service.  they offer thai-rolled ice cream and hk egg waffle w/ ice cream in a variety of unique flavours. i was especially intrigued by the hk milk tea flavour, which i will definitely come back and try next time.   my boyfriend and i had the french vanilla ice cream w/ original egg waffle and i absolutely love the cuteness of the presentation of the dessert. they made a panda face on the ice cream w/ oreo bits and chocolate.   the wait can be quite long, depending on how many people are there, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went to this place after seeing pictures of the egg waffle pizza. I ended up ordering the hawaiian egg waffle pizza and it was sooooo delicious! It is a very unique twist on pizza and egg waffle. After just ordering the egg waffle pizza, I decided to try the coconut egg waffle and green tea ice cream. The coconut egg waffle was very special as it had actual coconut flakes inside. This experience was just so great that I came back the next day to try the hong kong milk tea thai rolled ice cream. It was presented in such a cute way with a umbrella and sprinkles. The ice cream was so rich in flavour and super creamy. To add on, the couple there is very sweet and nice! :) Looking forward into going again!!!"}
{"text":"Owner is super nice and he puts a lot of care and effort into making your egg waffle. Tried the coconut egg waffle and it was delicious and crispy."}
{"text":"This is a super cute store in the plaza that sells really fancy egg waffles and ice cream. The owners are very generous and welcoming. I'll definitely be coming here with my friends again!! We got the og egg waffles deal and ube thai rolled icecream."}
{"text":"We heard good things about this place from friends. Parking is alright and well accommodating. Toast Delight is hidden upstairs inside one of the commercial buildings surrounding a small plaza of some sort.   Service was very nice and helpful when choosing waffles and flavors. They had a lot of unique flavors for both the bubble waffle and the ice cream ranging from $6-$10. We got the original waffle with Ferrero Rocher rolled thai ice cream and another original waffle with rolled cookies and cream ice cream. Then added another original waffle with a drink.  The waffle was fluffy inside when you bite into it but at the same time held well together with rolled ice cream on top. Waffles and ice cream all in all are a great match.  One of the downsides to this place is that it's a small food stall with one tiny bench to sit on while waiting. Other than that, there really isn't any other place to sit and enjoy your ice cream near Toast Delight. Another is the waiting time, especially if other people ordered before you. Waiting time for 3 bubble waffles with rolled thai ice cream and 1 drink took about 12 minutes. Also, be careful ordering the waffle with rolled ice cream! The shape of the cup that it's served in makes it challenging to eat the waffle and ice cream one spoon at a time.   Overall, great place! Would definitely come back with friends the try the other flavors."}
{"text":"I got the pizza egg waffle and it was like a 9/10. It was super saucy and cheesy. The only reason I say 9 is because at the end of the day a 10/10 would be real pizza. My sister got the black sesame with HK milk tea waffle and it was good as well. The only thing I suggest is that if you like your egg waffle a little on the softer side, I would let him know.  Also, the owner is a gem. He's super sweet and he also gave us a free can of coke to go with the food."}
{"text":"I visited Toast Delight while family was shopping for grocery in T&T Unionville.  I have ordered red bean and green tea flavour egg waffles. They are made to order so I got them hot and fresh.    The red bean flavour stood out more for me.  I think it is quite unique that the waffle batter was mixed with a paste similar to the Chinese Red Bean Soup (???).  I tasted the dried tangerine/orange peel (??) along with the red bean and it is not too sweet.  The exterior is crunchy but the interior is a bit too dense.  The waffle texture is a bit too hard for my liking.    Overall, owner is very pleasant and friendly and price is reasonable for the selection of flavours. Not bad to have Hong Kong Style Waffle while shopping in that area."}
{"text":"Yeah, for sure I would not go back. The matcha waffle literally had no MATCHA flavouring at all, it tasted exactly like the original. The waffles were crispy in a hard kind of way, i couldn't even finish it. Waited 15 mins for 2."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  There's a huge variety of flavours and the service is very friendly.  Definitely coming back to try all the flavours."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place in the past and I've wanted to try it out. Gotta say, this place was in an odd location. Inside the T&T mall, it's located on the second floor and it's in a small little booth that's ran by 2 people. I got the Matcha waffles for $4.50. They are made fresh so after I paid, they told me that it'll be ready in 10 minutes for one waffle. The Matcha egg waffles were great but they weren't super great. The outer part was harder and drier than what I'm used to and the inside was pretty dry too. It had hints of the green tea flavour but not much. It definitely tastes more authentic to its HK roots. I would get it again if I was already in the T&T mall / plaza area but I wouldn't make my way to get it."}
{"text":"Favorite egg waffle place in the GTA! :)  Staff are friendly and really care about the food they are selling.   Called in to order a pizza waffle, because they usually take 15-20 min! Went to T&T in the mean time! The pizza was savory and sweet, and very filling! For $10, it also came with a pop.   Also ordered the pork floss and black sesame egg waffle! Delicious! Cant wait to go back and try other flavors :)"}
{"text":"I'm sure my rating will change as I try other items from their menu but as of right now, I'm just gonna base it on my first experience.    Being a huge ube/taro fan, I had to of course try their Ube Thai rolled ice cream in a waffle.  The waffle itself is delicious with the perfect crisp and moistness.  The ice cream however, was lacking that ube flavour even though they used real ube.  I found it to be too milky in both flavour and texture. Perhaps the recipe itself with the real ube being folded into the cream made it that way.  I think if they had maybe used more ube flavour in the liquid that they \"roll\", it would make a huge difference.  I would still order it to see if maybe it was just an off day.  3/5.   What was absolutely delicious though was the ube stuffed waffle.  That I can eat alone.  Had not only the right amount of ube but the flavour was there, unlike the ube ice cream that I had.  5/5."}
{"text":"This place has fun flavours for their waffles, I tried green tea and chocolate with some friends, we preferred the chocolate flavour. The waffles themselves were a very different texture from what were were used to, the waffles were very crispy on the outside and dense on the inside, much like a cake. I can see how it can be appealing to many people, maybe just not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in all of Canada for egg/bubble waffles!! Unlike many places, the waffles are made fresh to order! Also, the batter has lots of egg taste, not too sweet and very very fluffy. They also have lots of flavours (durian, ube, pizza) and variations including bubble waffle with ice cream rolls! But for me, I like the original egg waffle because I like the taste of the waffle itself and I don't like it soaked in ice cream. They also have a special for the original waffles which is 2 for $5!  Overall 4/5, because I think the service is a little slow. Last time I went there was a pretty long line up, but only 1 person making the waffles. Also, I think the prices for ice cream with waffles is a little too high (+$3 just for ice cream)!"}
{"text":"For all those who aren't familiar with the area and have a recent obsession with egg waffles and ice cream, toast delight is located in the TNT mall on kennedy on the second level. Go up the escalators and its to your right.   They offer multiple flavour selections here - for just a green tea waffle, its $3. But if you wanted green tea and red bean, I was told its $4. That's for my adventures next time. And yes, I'll be coming back.   Waffle-wise they are a bit more crispy and cooked then the other place across the street. Pair that with ice cream, I could see it being a sturdy waffle-scoop.   Worth trying if you're in the area and looking for a snack."}
{"text":"There is a reason why I take the 20 km trip from home to this place with my foodie friends from Scarborough-Pickering border many times now (and counting) -- this place is sooo good!   This little unit is located on the second floor of the Langham Square Mall. There are escalators in front of the T&T supermarket that takes you to the second level. Once you proceed ahead, you'll smell the sweet yum yum smell of them egg waffles. Just follow that amazing aroma and you'll see the unit to your right.   During our visits we were greeted and served either by the owner or, who we presumed was, his wife. They were both genuinely friendly people who like to have great conversations with you if you wait there to get your orders ready. I never really get impatient there, mainly because the both of them are easy and comfortable to chat with, and the building itself has many things to keep you occupied (me being an amateur photographer love having mini photoshoot sessions 'cause 1) many times it's empty and 2) lighting is always on point).   On average, you'll be waiting for +/- 10 mins for 1 waffle to get ready; longer wait times if you order multiple waffles and ice cream to go with it haha.   Waffles I've had + Prices:  For $3 (or 2 for $5): Green tea, 3 Cheese, Chocolate (chips), Pork floss & seaweed, Plain.  For $4.50: Red Velvet, S'mores (New item!) With 2 scoops of ice cream added to waffles, it's $3 addition. Flavours we've tried: Vanilla, Butterscotch, Mint Chocolate. Ice creams were nothing special, but it's a great addition and pairing with the waffles. They will serve your ice cream waffles on a spiraly metal cone stand which I think is a cute presentation. One constructive criticism for the store, though, is putting the ice cream waffles in a leak-proof wrapper rather than their usual Toast Delight paper wrapper because unfortunately the melting ice cream got all over my friend's jacket, and she wasn't really intrigued about that.   My favourites would have to be the Pork floss & seaweed, 3 Cheese, and Green tea. I like how the batter is full, giving the cooked waffle a nice and even crunchy shell with a dense, cakey inside. We were one of the first to get the S'mores waffle, and I'll give it 7.5/10. It includes choco chips, graham crumbs, and marshmallow. Mind you, when the waffle cooks, the marshmallow melts, and I wouldn't have known it was there, unless you carefully inspect the shiny spots on the waffle. Graham crumbs definitely adds a greater crunch factor.  On our latest visit, we meant to try the Pizza waffle, but the lady explained that it would have been a +/- 30 min. wait, so we didn't end up getting it because we were short for time. She did explain that we can call ahead to order, so it would a quick and easy pick-up. Will try that and their HK milk tea next time!  Also, if you're taking these waffles to go and eat them later, I highly recommend in putting them back in a toaster to heat them up and get them crunchy again. You can also put them in the microwave for a few seconds if you want them hot and soft. Either way, the waffles are still bombbbb."}
{"text":"This little egg waffle shop is ran by the sweetest couple, that welcomes you in with opened arms. If you happen to speak canto, they'll likely converse with you while you wait for your order!   I got a regular egg waffle with the two scoops of neneapolitan, it took around five to ten minutes, a little long but the sweet couple kept conversing with us, so time passed relatively quick.   Overall, it was really good. You can tell that the owners really enjoy what they do, and they really do care about their customers. It's my go to spot whenever I'm in Markham, and it really can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Hard to find initially, but definitely worth the mission! The owner's are super friendly and there are so many choices of waffles you could choose from. I think the best part is the number of choices and the different combinations you can choose from. We opted for a chocolate chip waffle with mint chocolate chip ice cream and it was perfect for two to share.   Excited to return to satisfy more bubble waffle cravings :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I finally decided to try a new flavour!   I tried their HK Milk Tea rolled ice cream on a regular waffle. I was really surprised when the ice cream tasted EXACTLY like hk milk tea! It was super strong in flavour.   I like how they switched up their packaging. Before it was only a paper bag holding my ice cream and waffle, having it drip all over the place. Now they switched to plastic cups which is SOO much more convenient.   My favourite icecream/waffle place. Even if theres a wait, it's not too bad because you're surrounded by so many shops."}
{"text":"The food and service is great.  Run by a couple...if it gets busy the wait time can get long.  The thai ice cream is really yummy.  They have so many favours to select from.  The people running it are so friendly.  We been twice already and will definitely go back again.  My kids loved it.  If you ask for the HK waffle with ice cream, they will add chocolate chips to the ice cream to make it look like a bear.   I didn't realize that they only take cash and the 1st time I went there I was a dollar short and they were ok with it.  Because I went back a couple of days later and bought my whole family and my sister's family to try them out :)"}
{"text":"Toast Delight is a tiny, tiny unit on the second floor of the plaza.  The second floor has nearly no traffic and is almost all empty, but luckily you will see the store right away when you enter and turn right.  It's owned by an older asian man who's quite friendly.  Their menu is plastered on the window/wall on regular computer paper, so this could certainly be improved.  That being said, they have an extensive menu of asian waffles.  Besides the original (still my favourite) there is at least 20 other flavours including conventional ones like sesame to outrageous ones like kimchi.  I admire their creativity and appreciate the wide selection.  The waffles will range from $3 to $5 depending on the flavour and as far as I can tell there are no 2 for $5 deals (common for waffles in Pacific Mall).  This tiny space will not have any seating (barely has a little stool for people who are waiting) so this is strictly take-out only.  I'm hoping this store will expand!"}
{"text":"5 star for great service and variety of products and flavours. Thai ice cream rolls, waffles, rich ice cream flavours and crispy on the outside while soft on the inside waffles. There's no seating at all here but for once I didn't care.  A very sweet couple run this family business. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Waffle was luke-warm when I got it. They only accept cash (ATM was not working downstairs). The ice cream was delicious and lots of flavours!! Wish the waffle was hot but the taste itself was really nice. :) I would visit again and give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop run by grandma and grandpa.  Food: 4/5 Inconsistent at times.  Service: 4/5 Very friendly. Environment: N/A Not very much. Just store front. Washrooms: N/A Mall washrooms available. Worth it?: 4/5 Fun little stop when in the area.  Long wait at times.  The perfect little snack stop. Chinese waffles are good but are overdone at times. Ice cream is scooped not soft serve but this allows for a large number of flavors. Allot of care is put into everything they make but when a line starts to form, service starts to get flustered and snacks turn out Inconsistent.   I very much enjoyed the milk tea the first time I was here. Quality has varied ever since. Milk tea seems to be premade and reheated so maybe that has something to do with it.  Will definitely stop by whenever I am in Langham Square for a quick snack but wouldn't venture for it."}
{"text":"I got the rose egg waffle with a $1 add on to ribena tea. The tea was very yummy and sweet. The egg waffle has a really strong rose flavour and is super crispy and nice! You can tell they put a lot of effort into making them. The best part about this experience is that the couple working there are super kind and friendly! They really made my trip there worth it!   I would recommend going to try flavour, I look forward to trying new ones!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Toast Delight and I loved how they offer so many flavours for bubble waffles and Thai rolled ice cream. I tried the Ferroro Rocher bubble waffle ($6). It was a bit pricey in my opinion and they didn't accept card so I had to go to the ATM. There was also limited seating which was unfortunate. I do want to come back to try their Ube (purple yam) flavoured bubble waffle! They also have a promotion right now! It's 2 original bubble waffles for $5!"}
{"text":"It was my first time NOT having the original HK egg waffle flavour, and it was SO GOOD!! I got the Hong Kong coffee & milk tea mix bubble waffle with red bean ice cream ~ I love drinking HK coffee & milk tea (??) and so obviously I had to try this flavour! The waffle was not too sweet so the red bean ice cream added a nice sweetness to it. The owners are a cute little couple, and they were sweet enough to lend me a stand for me to take the picture of the waffle. They're so cute and nice!! I'm excited to go back to try the ube bubble waffle and ice cream!!"}
{"text":"I love egg waffles and toast delight has delicious ones. The man who works there is so friendly too! The price is average, but the quality is there. Whenever I come to the T&T downstairs, I always make a stop over at Toast Delight!!"}
{"text":"Location/Service Within the Langham Place plaza, this little shop is actually on the second floor (above T&T Supermarket). Once you're up the escalators, it will be on the right hand side.  Since it's in a plaza, plenty of parking (above and underground) available. The restaurant is small (with no seating) and it's filled with their menu by the window display. There's also a little table of some of their items as well. Service is so so nice! The owner is a couple (speaks Cantonese), very friendly with a warm, homey feeling. Very approachable and attentive. Even though I was there for the first time, I felt like I've known them for a while.  Food Specializing in Chinese-style egg waffles. They are freshly made after you place the order (so it does take a few minutes). There is a wide variety of flavors to choose from - including some fusion ones. The one I ordered was Ube Egg Waffle (~$6.00). Literally, every bubble was stuffed with ube. And it's the real deal, not some food coloring or blended batter. Outside is crispy and inside is soft and filling. I enjoyed it a lot.  This is truly a hidden gem and I'm glad there's a lot of positive feedback for this place. Definitely will come back and try their other flavored egg waffles!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I heard about Toast Delight offered a variety of Hong Kong style egg waffles and we went there during dinner time (we saw their pictures on Instagram and the portion size looked huge). Toast Delight was located on the second floor of Langham Square. After you took the escalator, it was on your right hand side. You won't be able to see a very vivid sign of the store. However, I liked how the store looked very clean and bright. We were very lucky that there was no line up that day. We were served by the owner, a very kind, sincere and nice man. We ordered a savory and sweet egg waffle so we could compare the difference between them.   -- Food and Drink --  1. Pizza egg waffle: Medium size pepperoni and a lot of cheese layered on top of the egg waffle. Originally, I never thought salty and sweet would go well together. I like how the owner let the egg waffles cool down on the cooling rack for couple minutes before adding toppings on it. It made the waffle much crispier and the crunchy texture will last till you finished it. The owner then layered a generous amount of pepperoni and cheese on the waffle and put it in the toaster. We didn't eat the pizza waffle until we got home and it was still very crunchy and cheesy.   2. Smores egg waffle: Similar to the previous one, the owner layered semi-sweet chocolate chips, along with graham bits plus countless small marshmallows on the waffles. I liked how he toasted the waffle again which made the marshmallows looked brown and created a melting effect on the waffle.   -- Overall --  Both of these pizza combos came with a can of coke. The service and food was amazing. I couldn't find a reason not to come back for more egg waffles! :)"}
{"text":"Toast Delight was a tasty treat on a rainy day for me! I was drawn to this little shop on the upper level of Langham Square by the fresh smell of HK waffles! It's usually quite busy and they have a lot of different flavours like milk tea, taro, matcha and more but I honestly just like to stick to the regular one. Classics are usually my Go-to for HK waffles.   I really enjoy the HK milk tea as well because it's just as sweet as I like it. While it's not comparable to Marathon Milk Tea, it is still quite tasty and a bit more on the sugary side.   Anyways, a regular HK waffle is $3.50 but they do have promotions occasionally where you can get 2 regular waffles for $5 if you bring in an non-perishable food item donation -- they had this promo during Easter and thy had gathered a lot of food.   I also like the old lady and man that work there -- they're efficient, friendly and really nice to talk to! A definitely try this place if you're in the square and craving some HK waffles. -- sometimes the waffles are a bit too crunchy when it gets busy."}
{"text":"This dessert place is tucked in a little corner up the escalator, above the T&T grocery store. Its run by a very kind grandma and grandpa who were very welcoming and consistently had a smile on their face.   Luckily on my visit, there wasn't that much of a line, it was only until afterwards that the line starting building, which just goes to show the popularity of the storefront.  Overall, there was a lot of choices of egg waffles, ice cream and even Thai rolled ice cream. Not to mention that you could even combine them as well. My girlfriend and I got the Ube Egg waffle and the Strawberry Thai ice cream. Personally for me I really loved the waffle, it was just the way I like it, crunchy (but not too crunchy) and fluffy in the inside. Far too many times I would have egg waffles that were soft all over or way to crunchy like I was eating chips.   The Ube waffle in combination with the Thai ice cream paired very well together. I would want to come back and try their other flavors especially if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A small but cute place for egg waffles and ice cream! Got the Ferraro Rocher waffle with the red bean ice cream and total came up to $9. A little pricey but tasted delicious and worth the insta pic ;) Might have to come back to try their other flavours, they have a ton!"}
{"text":"I love their egg waffles. Crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside. I tried the HK milk tea flavour but I would almost second guessed the owner for making my order wrong as it tasted nothing like HK milk tea.   I ordered the egg waffles with black sesame ice cream but overheard that they ran out of the black sesame flavour. Instead of hitting me with disappointment, the owner ended up mixing the flavour behind the counter and got me two scoops of black sesame ice cream to fulfill my order. You could clearly see that the colour wasn't as black as normal black sesame ice cream, it looked almost like cookies and cream. The flavour was there, just not strong enough.   The price is a bit steep too with the ice cream but I'd come back again to try other flavours. Hopefully it will be better for me next time."}
{"text":"The owners were super friendly! Got an egg waffle and durian Thai rolled ice cream, super yummy! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I stop by here usually after shopping at the T&T downstairs.    Egg waffles are really good.  I have so far tried the original, green tea, sesame and red bean.  I like the original and red bean the best.  The owner is a very nice man and everything is made to order.  There is usually a bit of a wait for the waffles as a result.  Not too bad though, about 10 minutes.  Prices are very good $3 for 1 and $5 for 2."}
{"text":"I came here super excited because they had HK Milk Tea Egg Waffles. I /love/ egg waffles and was happy to hear that they had a HK Milk Tea flavour for it.  However, I was super disappointed. Firstly, the HK Milk Tea Egg Waffle made for the customer before me looked really nice (thought a bit burnt). However, when I was given mine, it looked like a sad excuse for an egg waffle. The \"bubbles\" were collapsed, the thin parts were /super/ burnt, and it was unevenly coloured. The only good thing was that I could taste the milk tea flavour at least. However, the outside was barely crispy and the inside was like mush. It wasn't worth the over 20 minute wait for it (though I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes).   Overall, it was actually one of the worst egg waffles I've ever eaten. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the amazingly delicious ones I've had in Hong Kong, but the homemade egg waffles my mom makes are even ten times better than the one from here. I'd be better off just asking her to try and incorporate a milk tea taste to hers."}
{"text":"Super cool place to get some fun looking ice cream in a waffle. They have some really good and different flavours. As other reviewers said, it's definitely hard to get to, they should really put up signs. I just asked around and found it.  I got the squid ink flavour. It was salty and interesting. It wasn't bad, but definitely won't be getting it again.   My friend got the Nutella flavour waffle and ice cream and it was so yummy.  The owner was the sweetest person in the world, I absolutely loved him. He was so helpful with us choosing things and told us when things would cost more which I really respected."}
{"text":"Was quite excited to try this place out since I had just come back from HK and my passion for egglets was still burning strong.   First off, it was relatively confusing finding this place because it was not located on the plaza's store directory. After a bit of exploring, it turned out to be a quaint little shop located on the right immediately after going up the escalator. And when I say quaint, I actually mean bar stool seating for 4 that faces the owner (who realistically only has enough space for himself to walk 5 steps horizontally).   The owner seemed friendly and promptly began to make my order which was one green tea flavour and one dried pork floss and seaweed flavour (took 7-8mins).   Sadly, both egglets were slightly disappointing. While I applaud the variety of creative flavours, neither of them carried the sweet and desirable aroma or mouth feel. The outer crunch was done well but unfortunately, the insides of both were relatively dense and didn't achieve that fluffy and spongy texture. Not to mention, both flavors were also not prominent enough. I wish he would've been more generous with the dried pork floss and seaweed because I could barely taste it in the batter.  Due to it's poor choice of location and overall sub-par quality of egglets, I would not intentionally come back again."}
{"text":"Best HK waffles I've had in Toronto. Green tea flavour was great and waffles crispy. Tried their new banana poppy seed flavour which was rich in real banana flavour.   Simply delicious.   Curry fish balls were pretty good too."}
{"text":"One of the best egg waffles I have had in Markham. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I have tried the matcha egg waffle, served with red bean ice-cream and also their ube flavour waffle. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Those HK egg waffles ice cream wraps are incredible. The balance of toasty warm and cold make this dessert super unique."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night around 9:30 pm. I had visited a nearby dessert spot earlier...(hint hint) but still had room in the dessert stomach for some egg waffles. Got the HK Milk tea style while my friend got the coconut. Pretty ironic since I was on my way to HK the very next morning. Luckily it was nearing closing so there was no one in line, and the two owners were friendly. My friends order came warm while mine was very hot, which I found the contrast to be somewhat surprising. The milk tea egg waffles tasted burnt. I found it to be lacking flavour, except for a handful of bubbles. They could have also been softer in terms of texture. The coconut one was similar, although the flavour was slightly more evident. Maybe I should have tried the original flavour first, as I had heard good things from friends and felt underwhelmed after my visit. At $4.5, this is reflective of an egg waffle with a specialty flavour. Sadly, that flavour was hard to find within my order."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place on the second floor of the same plaza of T&T. There was a sign up the elevator that guided me to the direction to the petite store. It is owned by a couple who are super friendly.  I made a call beforehand to check when they close. Sometimes they are flexible and close at 8:30PM or even 9PM.   Each waffles are made fresh to order so the wait time for each waffle is about 10-15minutes. We came late so there was no wait for us. I ordered the ube waffle which is purple yam paste within the egg waffles. It had good flavours, the ube making the waffle sweeter and giving it a pretty purple colour in between the waffles.   My friend ordered the pizza waffle which you can customize what you want on it. The waffle is the crust of it and makes the dish sweet while the toppings gives it a savoury flavour. We thought that was very creative and it had an interesting combination of flavour.   I can tell they are passionate of what they do with their very accommodating service and always thinking of creative flavours. It is more expensive than other HK egg waffles places when I can get 2 for $5 at other places. If you're feeling adventurous, stop by this place to try the different flavours they offer."}
{"text":"I was originally extremely excited for this place because everything just looks so cute and Instagram worthy. But in the end I would just say that it's okay. I got the sesame egg waffle with green tea ice cream and it really wasn't anything special. My mom did enjoy the sesame in it and the waffle was very crispy but I think I do prefer going to pacific mall and getting their egg waffles which are more of a fluffy consistency. So ultimately it depends on your preference for the consistency. The ice cream was your basic grocery shop ice cream so nothing special there. I probably would come back only if it was convenient but I wouldn't go out of my way to travel as it is $7 (for what I got) and isn't really that worth it."}
{"text":"Cute mom and pop shop, very sweet and all the treats are very tasty! Highly recommend if you're around the area! Favourite is the HK milk tea bubble waffles and Thai rolled ice cream."}
{"text":"A cute little takeout place on the second floor of the chinese mall with T&T in it. The owners are very nice and friendly.   We ordered a HK milk tea/coffee egg waffle with black sesame ice cream for $7.50 tax included. The waffle tasted exactly as the menu described and the ice cream was creamy and satisfying.   I'd recommend trying this place out as they have an extensive menu of waffle flavours; some conventional, and others not so much. I can't wait to try other flavours next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, since the store opened.  They have a really extensive menu here, with lots of choices.  They even have wholewheat batter.  I've only really tried the original, green tea, and chocolate chip flavours (my kids aren't very adventurous.)  They have a lot of savoury and sweet flavours and of course the pizza waffle too.  You can also get scoops of ice cream now.  The older gentleman that owns and works here is very friendly and always smiles."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and service is very friendly. We had the egg waffles with mint chocolate ice cream and they made it into the cutest creation ever! Picture speaks for itself - for $6 they really put a lot of effort into it and we were def not expecting it. Next time I want to try the pizza egg waffle!"}
{"text":"I like the variety of the Chinese bubble waffles. They have a gourmet selection, every time I go, I order the truffle cheese and it's so unique and tasty. They have other flavours such as Ferraro Roche, many to choose from. I would suggest that once in made, just let him let the bubble waffle to sit on the pan for awhile to let it cool down before it gets placed in a bag as you don't want it to go soggy. Worth coming to try if you haven't been yet!"}
{"text":"I came here on a saturday mid-afternoon and had to wait 10 minutes for 2 waffles. We got the original one and the green tea one. They were both made to be very \"crispy\" so when they bent it, it snapped in half. I was pretty excited cause I do like things to be crispy. But I first tried the green tea flavor and I didn't like it at all. It didn't match well at all. The scent of it was also a big turn off for me, maybe I'm sensitive, but it wasn't pleasant at all. I tried the original flavor, and it was much better, but it still had a taste to it that I did not like at all. After, I thought that maybe if I kept eating the green tea one, it'll be an acquired taste, but the more I ate it, the more disappointed I became. It was not good at all and it left my mouth and tongue feeling very \"rough\", the same feeling as when you eat excess pineapple or kiwi. I was pretty disappointed and I would definitely not go again."}
{"text":"Tried the egg-waffle green tea icecream. I felt the egg-waffle came out too hard (overcooked). They also used hand scooped icecream, while their competitor across the street (in Peach Tree Plaza) pair their egg-waffle with soft serve."}
{"text":"Owners are friendly! Great service and delicious Hong Kong waffles!! They have a wide variety of flavors ( red bean, coconut, sesame, green tea). Green tea flavor is a must try! Made fresh to order too :)"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch earlier from the same plaza and yes, I was still hungry. So my friends and I strolled around and decided to grab some egg waffles from here. This little store reminded me of the egg waffle push carts back in HK.   The store front is tiny and is ran by a couple (I imagine boss and boss lady). And the store itself is very compact. Shocking though, not much traffic on a Sunday. However it is long weekend, so I imagine everyone is out of town. The store itself is clean and well lit.   I ordered a egg waffle with black sesame and after about 10 mins, it was ready. I could smell the black sesame already as I was handed the package of goodies. This thing tasted so good! Not overly sweet, which I like. It is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I can taste all the black sesame, but it did overpower the egg waffle itself a bit, just a bit. Overall experience is pretty good. I am now intrigued how the pizza version will be like: savoury and semi sweet as one. I will come back for that."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after work around 10pm and the owner was waiting for his wife to pick him up. He was happy to make me a few waffles.   I ordered the original, green tea, and apple cinnamon waffles. All were so delicious. They were all crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The apple cinnamon was my favourite one and every bite had pieces of apples in it. There is an option to add ice cream to the waffles, but I was taking them home to share with my family. They seemed to really enjoy it as well!   The owner is very friendly and humble. We had a bit of a conversation during the wait for my waffles and he is happy to talk about anything you throw at him.   All around pleasant late night experience here. I'll definitely be back to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"John and his wife makes such a good team and you can tell how much love they put into their business. Having tried toast delight more than a few times, we had John cater at our wedding with a sweets table. Everyone was so pleased with the HK waffle. We later went back to toast delight and tried their ube Thai ice cream as well, the flavour and texture was as perfect as the waffles :)"}
{"text":"Toast Delight is in Langham Square on Kennedy, on the second floor above T&T. As soon as we got off the escalator, we smelled egg waffles and literally just used our noses and followed the scent to find the shop!  I first came here last summer, when they only had a few flavoured egg waffles, and no ice-cream or pizza or anything else like that. I recall the prices being less steep; they've almost doubled now! I guess it makes sense, considering other popular stores nearby like Wooffles & Cream and Cha Me Cha sell desserts on the pricier end as well.  I liked how their egg waffles were crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. There was also a lot of filling, so it wasn't just mostly empty air. The Black Sesame one was my favourite! I would definitely recommend ordering that because of the strong black sesame taste- they didn't cheap out on their ingredients! I liked the Matcha Egg Waffles as well because the green tea flavour gave it a very refreshing taste, perfect for a summer day.   Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the Hong Kong Milk Tea Egg Waffle. It tasted burnt and I couldn't taste the HK milk tea flavour at all. I think I ended up tricking myself into believing that there was a bit of a HK milk tea after-taste! Along with that, we got 2 scoops of Black Sesame & Red Bean ice-cream. The ice-cream was average, and tasted a bit too frozen (crispy and icy). I also noticed, when he opened the freezer, that they were just Chapman's, Breyer's, and other local supermarket ice-cream brands - not sure how I feel about this!  One thing though- I was impressed that the egg waffles didn't become soggy, even when wrapped around the ice-cream. Somehow, this combination of hot and cold, sweet and savoury was very satisfying.   The owners (husband and wife) were super cute and friendly. We had a nice conversation with him while we waited for our food. Wait time was around 8-10 minutes. I would come back to try come of their other specialties like the Pizza or Smores Egg Waffle."}
{"text":"I actually came in and tried an off-menu item which was the owner's creation of a pizza egg waffle. He told us we were the first customers to officially order it and it was quite endearing because he got really excited to sell it to us. He even whipped out his phone to take photos of the pizza AND US to capture the moment!   For $8 you can try the world's first HK egg waffle with pizza toppings. I must admit, I was a little thrown off by the combination. My first bite felt like I had literally put a pizza and egg waffle together. It did not mesh very well. It's just two things you would never imagine together. But it grows on you as your tastebuds adjust. I recommend easing into it...maybe try a bite with just tomato sauce. .then cheese and finally pepperoni. Overall, I'm glad I tried it because I did end up enjoying it and I think everyone should try it once  but don't expect something mind blowing. It's going to be a hit or miss. I probably wouldn't order it again but I will most definitely be back to try the regular egg waffles though. The egg waffles were so crispy on the outside but was nice and soft on the inside. Very big in size as well. Huge thumbs up.  Like what many of the reviewers here said, the owner is very humble and friendly. Willing to engage in conversation with customers and it doesn't come off as forced or overbearing. Makes me wish this place was in a better location and got more exposure!  I know the business hours on here say they close at 8pm but I think it's quite flexible. We called around 9pm and said we would be there for 10pm and the owner was very nice about it. So if you're feeling for this after a dinner, just call in and ask!"}
{"text":"You ever walk into a place and think: \"Well this is delightful\"? Sunny, tiny mom and pop shop? Delightful. Delicious smell of cooking waffles? So delightful. Over 50 different egg waffle flavours with multiple ice cream and topping options??? DELIGHT INTENSIFIES.   And of course that brings us to the topic at hand: Toast Delight, embodiment of the delightful. It's an unpredictably popular little egg waffle and rolled ice cream place on the second floor of an unpopular shopping centre. Honestly, I think Toast Delight is one of the pillars still holding up this waste of space that is a mockery of the real Langham Place in HK. Sorry, it really grinds my gears.  What doesn't grind my gears is how good these waffles are. The family that runs this place is as creative as they are friendly. It's almost as if they're challenging themselves to create the craziest egg waffles possible. HK Milk Tea? Okay, it's just flavour infused into the waffle. Real smashed ube? Challenging, yet doable. KIM CHI? Now you're crossing a line! And yet, it works.  Every egg waffle I've tried, despite its filling and flavours, is at the peak of egg waffle supremacy. The egg part is soft while the edges are nice and crispy. The HK Milk Tea/Coffee combo is probably one of the best waffles I've had, being very fragrant and flavourful. Kim Chi was the most interesting; the sourness and spiciness of the fermented cabbage worked surprisingly well with the sweet waffle. The egg part traps the kim chi so it doesn't make the waffle soggy in any way.   I haven't had the pleasure of trying their Thai-rolled ice creams or one of many handcrafted drinks yet but I'm sure they're just as good. When you see a couple as passionate as the Toast Delight owners are about their food, you just know whatever they put out would be good. Plus, just look at how photogenic everything is.   Next time you need a snack and don't mind fighting through a car park battlefield, Toast Delight is there for you. And if you can't go to them, they can go to you as they also do catering! Now you can bring their brand of delight to any wedding, birthday, or diversity awareness corporate function.   (97/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza egg waffle was super interesting.  It was savoury with the cheese and pepperoni on top but also sweet because of the egg waffle.  For $10 it also comes with a pop.  Although a bit pricey for the size, I still thoroughly enjoyed the snack.    It was a 10-15 minute wait however, but there are shops to explore around the area in the meantime."}
{"text":"Very good service and amazing ice cream. It's owned by an older Asian couple, they are super nice and explain the menu to you properly. You can get samples of ice cream if you ask them. 10/10"}
{"text":"Love this bubble waffle place! The workers are so friendly and you can definitely tell they work hard. The waffle is yummy and there's lots of selection for ice cream flavours."}
{"text":"The owner here is a really nice old man (and some times his wife is here also) he makes the waffles fresh, I now understand why it's called toast delight cause the egg waffles is really Crispy and hard like really toasted! I wish it was more soft like cake.  He makes everything to order and the prices at good, the waffles taste better with the ice cream! :)   they have added thai rolled ice cream to the menu and he does a great job at it! very authentic!  the waffles are still a hit or miss, sometimes it's out of this world delicious and perfect (when his wife makes it) and when the men makes it, it's too crispy for my taste."}
{"text":"Very unique flavours. I came here to try the pizza flavour, it wasn't too busy so I only had to wait 10 minutes. The lovely couple that worked there were very nice. There's tons of flavours including red velvet, kimchi, squid ink, ube and more. You can also choose to add ice cream on top. They also have Thai rolls (Thai ice cream). I would definitely come back again and try the other flavours. The pizza one came in a pizza box and tasted great. A pop was also include which I thought was nice."}
{"text":"tried the black sesame egg waffle. personally, i didn't think that it was very good, in contrary to most of the reviews here. this is probably because of the fact that i've spent a good amount of time in hong kong, and they make egg waffles differently there. they had a nice shop with very cute decor, but i felt that the egg waffles were too soggy and wet for me. next time, i plan to try their ice cream, which i think i will like much more."}
{"text":"First time I came here when they initially opened I thought it was ok .. Had their sesame egg waffle but recently had been seeing pics of their new flavours so thought I'd give it another try. Tried their hk milk tea egg waffle today .. Loved it ! Unique and rich tasting .. :) will come back to try their newer flavours again ... Eyeing the ube flavour next !!"}
{"text":"After seeing delicious-looking photos of pizza egg waffles, I decided to check this place out, and see for myself.  So I ordered the pizza egg waffle combo for $10 after tax ($8.88 is the price before tax). Combo comes with a coke drink.  We asked how many toppings can we get, and the guy said they can put as much as they can on the egg waffle :) but we have decided to order ham and pepperoni as the toppings.  We had to wait 20 mins, but the wait was worth it! When it was done, the server asked if I would like to take a picture to post on social media before he cuts the pizza into slices, and I said \"Yeaahh! I will definitely post this on IG and Yelp!\"   The photos did look like the side of the waffles are burnt, and I see that, but to be honest I don't really taste any burntness.  The pizza has 6 slices and good enough for 2 people as a quick snack.  The pizza tastes really good, really cheesy, and really tasty. I didn't taste the ham as much, but the pepperoni has some nice spice in it. It was hot and fresh and unfortunately I burnt my tongue as I was so eager to dig in!  I would definitely go back to get another pizza, or perhaps try their regular egg waffle kinds, or maybe even waffle with ice cream. They have a big selection.  Also, sources say (Yelp) they are closed on Tuesdays, but I came in today and the place was open. But before I came, I called to check. They might be open Tuesdays after all. Just a little note. But call just to make sure.  Review 46 of 100"}
{"text":"The popularity of Asian egg waffles combined with ice cream toppings and all other manner of things is definitely heating up in the city.  On a friend's recommendation, I paid a visit to Toast Delight to sample some of that egg waffle goodness.  It's a small shop (real small) on the second floor of Langham Place but it's real popular.  The menu is expansive but i stuck with what they are known for.  I ended up getting the egg waffle with black sesame ice cream.  The egg waffle was warm and fluffy and contrasted with the savoury but slightly sweet black sesame ice cream.  The portion was quite large for myself but luckily I had someone to share it with.  Sharing is caring after all.  Just a warning, the dessert is kinda top heavy so be careful whilst holding and walking with it.  I saw a poor girl not pay attention and shared her dessert with the floor.  Overall, I think it lived up to the promise of a sweet enjoyable dessert given any of your cravings of sweet or savoury."}
{"text":"Owners and staff are really friendly, and it's evident that they put a lot of care into their desserts. We came here cuz another place we go to was closed on Mondays. We ordered Himilayan Pink Salt Thai rolled ice cream in ube egg waffle and black sesame ice cream in regular egg waffle. The Himalayan sea salt was a bit much after about 3 bites, but the black sesame was really good. There's just something about it being so pitch black that makes it taste so much better than the greyish kind you get in most other places. The ube egg waffle was soft and I did enjoy the purple yam pieces.  The next day my mom wanted to try it too, so I got her the durian egg waffle while I tried the squid ink. Durian had a light flavour, not overwhelming at all. Squid ink looked charbroiled, but tastes like regular waffle, which is what I expected.  I'd have one suggestion tho, perhaps increase the custard powder a tiny bit? I found he recipe Ultra crispy, but not as soft inside as the original egg waffle place that I've been going to for the last 20 years. Just my personal taste tho! I'll be coming back to try other flavours"}
{"text":"We got the Thai roll ice cream with HK milk flavour. The flavour for the ice cream with so rich it was just delicious! I like how they would ask if you want whip cream before putting it on top of the dessert. To decorate it they put a cocktail umbrella on top! It's very cute."}
{"text":"DROOOOOL. OH MY GOODNESS, IT'S SO GOOD!  This place is upstairs above T&T in that empty mall upstairs. As soon as you go up the escalator, turn right and you'll see it right away. The man that works here is very friendly and efficient. There are several flavours of waffles, all for a great price. $5 for two and $3 for one, so obviously greedy me had to settle for 2. Honestly I wanted four but didn't have enough coins & they don't accept card.  Wait time was around 5-7minutes, which was acceptable. Unlike the 'wooffles' across the street that take two and a half days. These waffles were also a lot bigger and tastier. I picked the pork floss & seaweed, which was amazingly savoury. If you like salty and sweet, this is your thing. It was huge and every bite was better than the last. We also bought the green tea one, which looked really great. The matcha on the inside was prominent (at first, I was eating it with the pork floss one and couldn't taste any of the green tea, then after eating it by itself, I fell in love) The flavour was very strong and has the authentic bitter green tea taste. Love!  These waffles are very crispy, bubble-like and again, they are huge. My mouth could not get enough. I swear, I'm going to burst soon and I'm still munching.. please.. make delivery..   I'm just putting this out there, bring this to me and I'm yours."}
{"text":"Made to order, ultra fresh and crisp egg waffles? Yes,  sign me up!   I've been meaning to come and try out toast delight for the longest time but it never seemed to be open when I went. Finally after a random visit shortly after 8pm (supposed to close at 8pm), the lady that was there was kind enough to still serve us. We just ordered the standard egg waffle with red bean ice cream. Yes, there's bit of a wait but the wait is worth it - The egg waffles were the star of the show. They were so warm, crispy, and tasty and were just the right consistency. You could pick apart ovals of the waffles and eat them with just enough ice cream on them. The ice cream was just standard ice cream, but is good enough to get the job done.  Their prices are slightly cheaper to Woofles and Cream, and they definitely have more ice cream varieties. But if you're craving better ice cream, visit Woofles and Cream for their soft serves instead. That being said, I do know that I'm definitely visiting Toast delight to try their pizza waffles next."}
{"text":"Above the T&T supermarket on the second floor. It took us a while to find this place in the rows of empty stores in the in a very quiet plaza (its near the escalators)  We got there at about 7.30pm on a weekday and it was pretty empty. We had to try the egg waffle pizzas. I got the sweet chili sauce. For $8 you get a personal pizza and a can of pop. The wait was about 10 mins for 2 pizzas. The store itself it really small, enough seating space for 2 at the counter. The pizza was good and slightly sweet from the waffle. It was cheesy and comes piping hot out of the oven. It is the perfect serving size for one and comes in a personal box. Frankly quite innovative and such a novelty to have. I also got the matcha egg waffle for dessert. It was not bad, it was crispy and had a slight green tea flavour which was good.   There was 1 older gentleman working which Im assuming was the owner, he was very friendly and had a lovely conversation with him while we were sitting at the counter. When we were done he even took our garbage for us."}
{"text":"Lady working there was really kind and was done making my order in around 5 minutes! :)  I got the original waffle with matcha and dutch chocolate ice cream. I will definitely go back again to try out more flavours!"}
{"text":"This shop is located on the second floor of Langham square and is owned by the nicest and cutest couple ever!! I have always passed this place when I get my nails done, but have never really gotten the chance to order anything off their menu due to time constraints. I'm glad to say today I finally tried their egg waffles. They have a very extensive menu for egg waffles and other desserts, like thai ice cream rolls. I ordered the coconut and HK milk tea. I really enjoyed the crispiness and the flavour of the coconut. The HK was a bit underwhelming for me, as I'm used to a more rich taste. I will be coming back, with extra company to try even more items on their menu"}
{"text":"Crispy af waffle.  Black sesame ice-cream was good, too hard to enjoy together with the waffle though, difficult concept"}
{"text":"Egg waffles is what i ate as a kid when i grew up in Hong Kong and I am glad after 20 years in Toronto, Markham area is starting to have decent egg waffles besides your typical tung tung (they are not even that good to be honest).  Came here a few times already and my most recent visit (in the new years), I noticed they do not have 2 for $5 anymore, in fact, they increased the prices for all egg waffles significantly.  Your regular egg waffle is now $3.25 and your special flavour is now $4.50.  I don't mind paying a premium if the egg waffle is delicious like the \"North Point\" Egg Waffle store in Hong Kong, but the matcha and milk tea flavour I had did not live up to the price tag.  I felt VERY thirsty when I ate the milk tea flavour which means it must had a lot of sugar in them.  The crunchiness of the egg waffles from this store is still top notch, but flavour wise, I would rather go to Woffles and Cream a plaza down."}
{"text":"So delicious! My boyfriend and I had the HK style waffle w HK milk tea rolled ice cream! The ice cream tasted so creamy and true to flavour. The couple who owns the place are the absolute cutest and are so happy doing their jobs. Loved it"}
{"text":"Just tried their black sesame Thai rolled ice cream.  Wow that was good.  Mixed with real toasted black sesame, the ice cream was bursting with sesame glamour.  Waaaaay better than other black sesame ice creams I've tried. It was almost savory too as I'm convinced salt was expertly mixed in as well.   I will definitely be back for this."}
{"text":"Nice & Friendly Staff. Menu was a bit confusing but we managed to figure it out after 5 minutes or so. This is a hidden gem, their egg waffles are by far the best out of all the other ones in Markham,the batter was made perfect (not like other ones that tasted like sponge cake). We tried their Ube (purple yam) Egg Waffle & Himalayan Salt Thai Ice Cream Rolls. Both were amazing and very rich flavored.  I'm a big fan of the Original Authentic Egg Waffle and this place makes the best so far, very crispy! There are no seats inside this small shop,most customers will grab & eat on-the-go.  I'm very impressed by the owners in making their way up in such a short period of time.  Will come again & try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after passing by it multiple times. LOVED the waffle and ice cream here! The waffle here is made fresh so it is crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside, just the way it should be. You also get 2 scoops of ice cream of your choosing. I thought this was good for eating yourself (because its so delicious, why wouldn't you want it all for yourself) or even for sharing.   Service here was fast. Your waffle gets made in a matter of minutes!  I think the only bad thing about this place is the location. It's located in a building above a T&T and there isn't anything else there. Over half the stores in the building are empty.   There also isn't really any seating area (besides a counter with 2 seats) there so it's more of a take out place.   This place is on the top floor of the building. When you get off the escalator, you turn right and it is right there. If you're coming off the elevator then turn to your left and then head right and it should be right in front of you.   The exterior of the place was not what I expected it to be at all. The first time I went looking for it I completely missed and walked past it multiple times. The outside of the store does not have any fancy signs or anything like I expected it to. The glass on the outside of the storefront is covered in plain white paper with the menu printed on it.   They have quite the selection of interesting flavours, such as durian. But beware that durian waffle does smell like durian! I was lurking in the building waiting for somebody one time and wondered why it smelt like durian. It wasn't until I passed by the store and saw the sign advertising the new flavours that I knew what I was smelling.   I will be back for sure to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"Did a little research to find the perfect egg waffles similar to the ones in HK before actually stopping by and was pleased with my choice.  As a first time Toronto visitor, the place isn't entirely difficult to find.  The store was smaller than I've expected but was a cute place to pick up a snack. Had the durian filling and the HK milk tea flavored ones. They're both great but I wish I tried the original one instead since that issssss what egg waffles are known for-- their eggy taste! The price ranges between $3 -$7 bucks and they're currently giving away free original egg waffles if you donate a canned item right outside their door!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for the infamous Asian milk toast but even though the name implies that they would sell it, they don't. My taste buds were disheartened.  Oh well, change of plans, I ordered a Mango Thai rolled ice cream for me (most popular flavor) and a strawberry one for hubby and of course topped with whipped cream. I stood by and watched the older gent bent over the large frozen metal cook-top furiously chopping away at the pieces of mango in order to incorporate them into the ice cream. I commented to him that it was a lot of hard work and he turned to me and smiled, his warning \"study hard\". I laughed out loud at his remark but my heart broke a little for this sweet, gentle old man.   Enough drama, to the dessert. The rolls were thin and broke apart into little pieces when I tried to use my spoon. I enjoyed it more when it melted a bit so I could scoop it out instead of chipping away at it. The whipped cream definitely made it taste better. It wasn't that sweet and the mango could have been more ripe but he definitely was generous with the amount of fruit he incorporated into the ice cream. The strawberry was sweet with a touch of sour which was an interesting taste experience.  If I'm in this mall again, I will be back to try the delicious smelling bubble waffles and the $2.50 bubble tea."}
{"text":"Very small place, luckily beat the rush of people that came so I had a seat to wait. Love the variety of flavors they have! This time I tried their Christmas special s'mores flavor, red velvet and red bean. Waited about 10 minutes, wasn't too bad. Loved them all! Especially the s'mores one! All the different ingredients went well with the waffle. The waffle is a bit more dense than some of the other HK egg waffles I've had making it a bit more filling but still really good! Has a nice little crisp to it too. They really make sure that all the fillings (chocolate, red bean etc.) is spread throughout the waffle. The owners are such lovely and friendly people! He even told me he had to throw out the first attempt at the s'mores waffle because he wanted it to be perfect. Really appreciate the great customer service and dedication to quality!"}
{"text":"Hot dam. I am not much of a dessert person but shit this place is the bomb. I literally thought the Hong Kong style Milk tea ice cream rolls were the best things I have ever had. Then holy crap the egg waffles with ice cream was yummy in my tummy. Needless to say, the food here is amazing and I want to try everything.  Aside from food, the older couple who runs the establishment is so nice and quite friendly and talkative. At this rate I'll come back so much they will become my second parents.  The service is only a tad slow since they are only two people and put so much love and care into making the food because Rome was not built in a day and neither was this dam amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Headed over to Toast Delight on a Saturday at 2pm. The place was empty except for a man working behind the counter. The shop is very small with only a counter and a few high chairs. The menu and food pics were plastered across the glass windows in front of the store. Menu was pretty diverse I would say, with items ranging from  The windows outside are posted with menus and photos. The menus was very diverse with options such as pizza, red velvet, smores etc. to go with any egg waffles. If you are brave enough you can even try getting your order of egg waffles with squid ink!  I ordered the original egg waffle with two scoops of green tea ice-cream, coming to around $7.50 (they only take cash!). It was very filling and the egg waffles were crispy on the outside and reasonably fluffy inside. The egg waffles were made fresh to order so it took a couple of minutes before I could indulge into them!  The old man working turns out to be the owner of the place and was super friendly. Toast Delight is definitely a must-good for a twist with HK local eats. Although a little pricey, I will be back to try some of its more unique flavours!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the rave is about this place. I went in to try their simple yet tough to perfect, plain waffle.  First off, the waffle was cold by the time I got it because they said it was a 15 minute wait which turned in to 30 minutes. Then I bit in to it and there was way too much flour in the batter so it was just hard and tough and floury.   Not to be harsh, I'm not giving it a 2 and not a 3 for no reason. I just didn't really like their egg waffles the way that other people do. I understand that it is $3 per waffle but it just wasn't even worth my time.   This little store is around the right corner after you get up the elevators from the Langham Square."}
{"text":"Amazing little egg waffle shop. We usually bring our kids upstairs to pick up the egg waffles after shopping at Tnt.  The owners are all very friendly and would talk to my kids. The egg waffles are delicious and definitely would recommend others to try.  They have a lot of different varieties as well."}
{"text":"Heard about this place here. Decide to give it a try. Got there around 2:15pm Saturday. No lineups. Placed the order and got it in under 10 minutes. We ordered the green tea flavor. $4.50 tax-in. So-so....personally I prefer the original flavor."}
{"text":"Very good, fast, quality. Excellent food and bubble tea as well but their waffles ate the best."}
{"text":"Actually I came here two weeks ago hoping to try their egg waffles with ice cream, but they were closed. This time I came, but I ate and didn't really have room for a full waffle ice cream combo. So I opt for just egg waffles. I chose the HK Style Milk Tea/Coffee Flavour. I tasted the tea part but didn't really taste the coffee side. My hubby said it tasted burnt, but I was ok with it. The flavour was there but not quite the flavour I imagine it to be. Overall it was a good treat, will come back again to try others :)"}
{"text":"The egg waffle was amazing here and the service was great. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it! First time trying ube anything! Ordered the ube waffle with ube Thai rolled ice cream and meat lovers pizza egg waffle.   This is a small mom and pop shop on the second level of the TNT plaza. The owners are very sweet. The man gave me the metal holder for my ube so I could take a photo. He knew!  The order took about 15 minutes to make. I paid cash.   The ube waffle and ice cream had a subtle flavour. I wished there was more flavour, but as this is my first time trying ube, I'm not sure if it could be more powerful. I loved the Thai rolled ice cream. They did a great job rolling it. The egg waffle was crispy and soft.  I liked the pizza a lot. The sausage had a lot of flavour. The salty flavour of the pizza ingredients overpowered the egg waffle sweetness, which I liked.  We paid $10 and got a pop with it. The owner said \"it's not complete without a coke\". Not sure if this comes with the order, but he was right, the coke hit the spot with the pizza!   The food is expensive here. We paid $23, but it's very big and filling so we didn't mind.   Beware it can get messy so take some tissues!  There's no place to sit here, but we went to arcade area at the middle end of the plaza to chow down."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations after enjoying Wooffles & Cream across the street, so that may be why I felt like my experience fell short of what I had expected. Part of the reason for this was the wait time, which was just as long if not longer than the lineup over at Wooffles. Word of warning: do not come here if you're not down to wait anywhere from 20-50 minutes. They realized that they had gotten the second part of my order wrong after finishing the first part so that tacked on another 10 minutes; they were really nice about it though and didn't charge me the extra $2 for an ultimate waffle. I liked that they had tons of interesting waffle and ice cream flavours to choose from, but I felt like the many choices and options for customization really slowed them down.  We got a red velvet waffle and a Hong Kong coffee & milk tea mix waffle w/ matcha ice cream; the waffles were decent but the HK waffle was too crispy for my liking and my boyfriend thought that it tasted a little burnt. The red velvet was much better in terms of texture but I felt like the red velvet flavour didn't quite come through. I didn't care too much for the ice cream as it was much too sweet so I'd recommend just getting the waffle by itself.  My curiosity has been satisfied for now so I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, mostly because of the long wait times. Those pizza waffles do look super tasty though so I will be back at some point!"}
{"text":"I literally took more than 15 minutes to decide which flavoured egg waffles I want, and I am usually decisive and quick with my orders. There were so many options to choose from, and all of them looked delicious. I had eaten lunch already, so I went with something simpler, the seaweed and pork floss egg waffle. I absolutely loved it - the egg waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and a perfect balance of sweet and savoury. The location was a tiny bit hard to find for me, but definitely worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best, most authentic HK style egg waffle store in Toronto.  They are made to the order so it's freshness at its best.  Its crispy exterior and chewy insides completely surpasses any of its competitors, not to mention the HONEST PRICING (original or those with specialty flavours such as a very legitimate green tea flavour) are all for $3 each or $5/2!   The owner is extremely pleasant retiree who enjoys the company of the customers and really seems to be take pride in his job to create the best quality waffles in the city.  Flavour and happy customers are his main concerns, rather than profit!"}
{"text":"The best HK style bubble waffles in Toronto! This is my go-to whenever I crave bubble waffles, which is at least once a week! The owners are really friendly and they have a huge variety of flavours, both savoury and sweet. They also have ice cream flavours like matcha and sesame which you can add to your waffles, or even prepare different flavours of Thai rolled ice cream. Their wait times have always been very reasonable, never more than 20 minutes, though I'm afraid once more people discover this hidden gem, that'll change :P I've tried so many flavours that I can't recall all: original, matcha, coconut, sesame, milk tea, ube (purple yam), cheese, durian, margherita pizza...none have ever disappointed. The pizza waffles are very unique, using the bubble waffles as the pizza base. If you enjoy sweet and savoury flavours, you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Got the matcha and pork floss with seaweed. The matcha one was a little too sweet for my taste, but the matcha taste was present. I would have preferred for a stronger matcha taste. The pork floss and seaweed one was good, the sesame seeds were a surprise.  Overall pretty good. Would go again."}
{"text":"BEST EGG WAFFLES!!!! No seriously!! They really push the boundaries with the variety and the egg waffles are always consistently fresh and tasty. My favourite is the kimchi egg waffle which is unusual but amazing. The location is rather sketchy and can be hard to locate if you don't know what you're looking for as its in the basement level of the store. Parking is sometimes hard to find but it's worth it when you taste the wonderful egg waffles."}
{"text":"First time trying toast delight and their original egg waffle - I was very surprised how tasty this was! I usually go to pacific mall to satisfy my egg waffle cravings but the crunchiness and milky flavour that the original waffle bad exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"The parking for the plaza is always full, this is an inconvenience in itself. The people were friendly and optimistic about their service,however the food was not good.   I ordered a matcha egg waffle and there was absolutely no matcha flavour. The waffle itself was over cooked in my opinion, one side was really hard while the other was soft. You're better off paying $3 at pmall for an egg waffle opposed to this one for $4.50...  Friend ordered durian bubble tea, tasted very frothy if that is what you enjoy. The flavour however wasn't very strongly of durian, more of milk. The tapioca also disappointed, not good at all. ($4.50 for basically all of their drinks)   Another friend got a egg waffle pizza, Hawaiian. For $10, it was definitely a poor choice. very small, very little pizza taste, not well done at all. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for dessert, the owners of the store was so nice. The ice cream was served pretty quick, and I was very happy with what I got."}
{"text":"LEMON TEA WAS ON POINT!  I also got an Ube Egg Waffle with Black Sesame Ice-Cream = DELICIOUSSSSS!   The couple were also super nice and friendly. Would highly recommend this place over Woofles & Cream.  ---  We came back after an unfulfilling dinner at Mom's Kitchen next door. Got a pizza waffle and another lemon tea. The pizza waffle comes with a can of Coke which we politely declined. Soooo MMmMmMmmmMm.."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Loved the ice cream and egg waffle. Just wished the egg waffles were a little softer."}
{"text":"Egg waffle galore! This place is like a hidden gem tucked away on hwy7 and Kennedy lol. It's cheap and freaking delicious! The owner looks like a very nice guy. Seems like he chills there and is having fun at what he does!   Toast delight has 8 flavors and I've tried green tea, sesame, pork and floss, and 3 cheese and I love the 3 cheese. Probably because I love cheese... don't judge me haha. I haven't tried the other flavors but they are probably quite good! It is very cheap $3 for 1 and $5 for 2. Takes about 10 minutes to make so just walk around or sit down till then! He also offers fish, beef balls and red sausages. On top of that you can get ice cream with the waffle for $3 more I believe.   They take Cash only, I forgot to mention this since most reviews I've seen don't mention it.   Definitely will come back for lots more!"}
{"text":"The combination is a perfect match. It's roughly $6-10 bucks depends what type of waffle you get and the ice cream. The waffle was alright... not crunchy and the ice cream wasn't much special but it's nice to have in the area. Grab one and go shopping at t and t."}
{"text":"Best egg waffle in town! Very very fresh! Crispy outside and chewy inside!! Yummy! This place serves ice-cream with egg waffle and many different flavours of egg waffle too.  Must try!!"}
{"text":"The amount of egg waffle flavours at Toast Delight is impressive! I've tried a few of the original  or typically offered flavours like pork floss + sesame +seaweed, matcha, sesame, and chocolate. Overall, their egg waffles have a harder shell than other places (I.e. Not soggy). This is good since soft and soggy egg waffles are a big turnoff. They have very unique flavours like squid ink, durian, HK milk tea, rose infused, and kimchi.   You can add ice-cream to your egg waffles in which it becomes a cone! Although it can get a bit messy, the owners are smart in offering a cup for you to avoid dripping. They also offer Thai rolled ice-cream and egg waffle pizzas - no reviews regarding these since I didn't have the chance to try them yet!  A down side, as with all egg waffle places, is the price. More unique flavouring egg waffles can be pricey like durian for $6. But I think it's worth the dollar! The owners are very friendly and welcoming - it really reminds me of home (HK). All in all, would I return? YES, still so many items to try!"}
{"text":"Best HK eggies I have ever had that is nice and crispy and don't let rave about the black sesame ice cream, this combination is to die for, I can say this can be my last meal, it was so filling, good enough for 2 people, they got many other flavors and toppings to customize and the owner is super nice!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right above the T&T supermarket at Kennedy and Enterprise. The owners were extremely friendly, and their snacks were all made to order.  I had the black sesame hong hong egg waffle- it was tasty and brought back childhood memories."}
{"text":"Right when I passed by, I knew I had to try this since it combined two of my favorite things! . Build your own pizza by selecting your base (regular or whole wheat), sauce (classic, pesto, or sweet chili), cheese, and toppings (veggie, meat, pepperoni, ham, bacon, mushroom, green peppers, red onions, tomatoes, olives, spinach, pineapples). . Many thanks to the owners of this little shop who were extremely welcoming to us when we were there! When you do what you love, you'll never work a day i your life, and the positive vibes radiates through to everyone."}
{"text":"I love me some egg waffles so when I heard about Toast Delight, I just had to make my way here.  Pros: Different take on egg waffles Super friendly owners  Cons: Takes a while to get your order  Anybody who knows their HK street foods knows egg waffles are a major staple.  Toast Delight offers egg waffles and other popular HK street foods all from a tiny little space.  I was quite amazed that can make all those items from the amount of space they have.  Toast Delight's offers their own little spin on the egg waffle.  Maybe it comes from their name, but their egg waffles offer a crispy on the outside, soft and dense on the inside feel.  It's almost as if they're lightly toasted.  I really liked this rendition of the egg waffle.  I like how the different textures give it a completely different experience.  We ordered the green tea and sesame flavour egg waffles and both tasted great!  They offer a total of 8 different flavours as well!!  The only caveat is that you need to eat these fresh more or less.  With time, the crispy texture becomes more of a stale texture which works against it.  Other than that, great egg waffle.  Little side note for HK style milk tea lovers.  They use the Black and White brand evapourated milk for their milk tea.  I'm told by tea enthusiasts that this is one of the best brands to use for milk tea.  Have I mentioned the owners yet?  The shop is run by what I assume is a married older couple.  They are some of the nicest owners I ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  They seem like they've been together for a while and love what they're doing.  I love these little ma and pa operations all the more when they owners are great like this.  My only gripe is because there are only 2 of them, the orders will take a while.  This is multiplied when it's super busy.  It took about 10 minutes for our 2 egg waffles to be ready.  Think about that when there are a couple of orders ahead of you.  Plan accordingly when you order from here.    I love this place.  As long as it's not busy when I pass by, I will be here ordering another egg waffle.  I have 6 more flavours to try at the very least!!"}
{"text":"Love the Hk waffles and ice cream here! Service is great! They seem to always have new items to try which is great."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I'm a fan. I've tried 4 different waffle flavors and I'm in love with the red bean flavor. It's not sweet and it has a nice subtle orange peel flavor to it. The matcha and sesame is a close second. The egg waffles are made to order so its guaranteed fresh. Only downside is you have to wait for it to cool down completely to truly enjoy the crunchy exterior and a soft interior. Personally I would give this place an edge over Market Village's Dong Dong. This place offers more flavors, their service is much much better and parking isn't horrendous."}
{"text":"3.5 I remember this to be my absolute favourite store for bubble waffles, not just because of the quality of the product but also the warm fuzzy feeling you get from mom and pop shops. They have evolved from that, offering a wider selection with more regular hours and multiple staff behind that lil counter...the overall vibe became more commercial over the years. Nonetheless, their waffles are made to order, fresh and piping hot. Wait time is prompt, typically within 15mins. They are fluffy inside with crisp edges. Flavours are a hit or miss, some flavours are not super pronounced or just doesn't work. (My old favourite was an off the menu banana and chocolate chip that I'd request from the owner, not sure if they would still make it anymore)"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about inflation! Ever since the last time I came here a few weeks ago, the prices have gone wayyyyyy up!  Seems like the owner has gotten way over his head and is trying to hop onto the new trend to compete with Woofles & Cream across the street. This store doesn't get much traffic to begin with as it is located in a new and deserted mall on the 2nd floor of Langham place.  The store now offers ice cream in with the waffle (+$3) as well as he has introduced a bunch of different flavours at very high price points. I tried the milk tea ($4.50) and red velvet ($5). The milk tea was very interesting with a distinct tea taste, worth trying but I probably would never get it a second time because of the price. The red velvet was a complete disappointment; it looked and tasted like chocolate cake.  They no longer have the deal 2 for $5 basic flavours (original, sesame, green tea); they are now priced at ~$3.00 each."}
{"text":"It is just an average waffle. The crust is not as crispy and the inner part is lacking of batter, which makes the whole waffle very blend. I am disappointed and would not coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly service! Waited a good amount of time, but was glad that my order was being made fresh. The owners were kind. The shop was a little tough to find at first, but they put up a sign to make it easier. Ordered the pork and seaweed! It was nice, but wish it had a stronger taste. It was overpowered by the sweetness of the waffle. Will be back to try some of their sweeter menu options."}
{"text":"Egg waffle or Thai Ice Cream?  Sweet or savoury?  Mango or Pizza??    I think you can figure out the choices seem almost endless when you come to Toast Delight!   Its located in a tiny spot up in Langham Square and has been getting a lot of press online recently and finally got to come try it out today.  Ended up getting Ube Waffle with vanilla ice cream as that was what my two kids wanted to try.  The owner saw that I was ordering for my kids and offered to put a single order into two separate cups so they can each have their own.  Very nice gesture!  The waffle tasted really good as they used real mashed ube not the extract that some places used.   The egg waffle was nice and crispy and went well with the ice cream.    As a side note the owners are the sweetest couple and you can tell they take a lot of pride in the product that they produce.  Its always a pleasure to support hardworking people in the area . Really look forward to trying all the other items that they have especially the Thai rolled ice cream.  4.5/5!"}
{"text":"This place always has lineups, super busy, smells super good every time I'm here, the guy raising his prices, but the waffles are good, try have lots of different flavours and you can order Chinese waffle ice cream and they have a new thing called pizza on a Chinese waffle,   Looked at some other reviews. Same thing, good food, line ups l, and the guy is raising prices."}
{"text":"3.5/5  *This shop was really small as well, there were enough room for two waffle pans and a counter with 3 stools.  *The main focus of Toast Delight is the Hong Kong egg waffle, however they also sell curry beef balls and bubble tea as well.  *offer a wide range of flavors, even the savoury ones!  *Good for a snack in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.   -Green tea HK Egg waffle - $3  -Pork Floss and Seaweed HK egg waffle - $3 While the egg waffles here kept their shape and remained crispy, I found the inside to be a bit too dense for my liking, which was the same problem I had with their pop-up shop in Sweetery.   In terms of flavor, I was unable to detect any green tea flavor in T's egg waffle. For mine, the owner was generous with the pork floss and & seaweed and it had a nice balance of saltiness. However after eating both for a while, I thought the waffle tasted bland and the ingredients didn't fully incorporated with the batter, which resulted in uneven ingredients with each waffle pieces."}
{"text":"Cute canto couple runs this tiny dessert place in the T&T building 2nd floor. Super nice and sweet ppl.  The black seasame ice cream was so delicious and creamy. Also got the hk milk tea egg waffles. Milk tea flavour was a bit weak bit loved the crispiness of it.  Cute design for bonus marks!"}
{"text":"My new Waffle Joint. A SMALL store that packs a punch. We used to go to pacific mall for our Hk waffle then there was Woffles and Cream but since reading the yelp reviews and being closer to our house why not give it a try? Right?! And my oh my! I am so glad we did. They had UBE/ TARO as the new flavour and soooo good for all the Taro lovers out there. If you love Ube you need to try. Subtle and packed with Ube paste through out. At first I was concerned it was going to be soggy however I was wrong and it came out crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside still! They are so many flavours and combos that are recommended by the owner. Nom nom!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of egg waffles all over the place and the ones we ordered here were amazing and some of the best we've had. Great texture - soft on the inside yet still crispy on the outside without being soggy. Each ball had a consistent amount of sesame as well. Looking forward to trying other desserts at Toast Delight!"}
{"text":"After browsing the reviews on yelp before finally deciding to try it out, I was surprised to find the store in the corner on top of the T and T. The waffle was delicious but the wait time was not. It is best to call in as the equipment for making their signature dish the pizza waffle is lacking. But if you want a normal waffle or non pizza one, they can make it in 10-15 mins. As i didn't know better, I had to wait over 30 mins for my pizza waffle. Otherwise the place is unique and gives off a wonderful small business kind of feeling, one that makes you believe you are supporting the community while wiping the saliva off your chin."}
{"text":"Very good service from the owner. He's really friendly and good to talk to and takes care when making the egg waffle. The place is very tiny, located above T&T. Lots of parking underground."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good like I can't even. The egg waffles are so crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. The outside is crispy almost like a fortune cookie! Honestly I didn't even know I was into crispy hk egg waffles until I tried this! Bye bye soggy hk egg waffles! This place deserves so much more hype!! I just wished they had a better location with more traffic so they get more exposure. The best part? They have green tea hk egg waffles! FYI I'm a green tea freakkkk! They have other innovative flavours like coconut, sesame, 3 cheese, pork floss and seaweed, red bean, chocolate, etc! AND!! You don't have to wait 40 minutes (just in case you don't understand the reference, I'm talking about wooffles lol). It's honestly so much better than wooffles, I don't think I'll be going to wooffles again as their waffles are soggy. Best hk egg waffles I've tried in toronto."}
{"text":"I gotta give it that they are SO CREATIVE! Pizza and S'mores egg waffles... how cool is that? I grew up eating HK styled egg waffles. I always wondered why no one would make it in any other flavours lol. Toast Delight definitely did the impossible ^^  First heard about them at Sweetery Toronto Food Festival back in the summer of 2015. The pork floss, sesame and seaweed egg waffle definitely caught my attention. Finally they opened a store at Langham Square on the 2nd floor. It is a small shop, run by these two lovely older couple.  They have a HUGEEE menu of egg waffle flavours - it takes about 5 minutes to digest that massive list - and you can also add 2 scoops of ice cream or Thai rolled ice cream with your order as well! So far, I've tried Ube flavour, Milk Tea, and Pepperoni & Cheese... they are all very tasty. I espeically enjoyed the savoury one :)  Please note: I assumed when I asked for Pepperoni and Cheese, it meant Pizza with the toppings on top... but they stuffed it inside instead lol. Make sure you specify that you want the toppings on the inside or on top.  Seriously, you can let your imagination run wild here. Delight Toast is small but it hits home pretty big for me! Great place to satisfy your dessert cravings ^^"}
{"text":"Its ok... Theres a hype to this place but nothing really great. Bubble waffles and fishballs and toast. Classic cantonese snacks. The waffle has different flavors which you can barely taste.  Fishball i order was luke warm. If you want to try it feel free , i just dont think its something worth that special."}
{"text":"5 stars for the adorable couple that runs the place 3.5 stars for the egg waffle   Okay, i'm gonna be honest. I'm pretty in love with my hk egg waffles. Although i'm born here, i have ate these since i was a kid. So I think im pretty pro when it comes to spotting a good egg waffle.   I ordered the Matcha egg waffle since i wanted to try something different but nothing too extravagant from the OG egg waffle.   The batter was ALMOST perfect. The waffle was slightly too firm. Unfortunately, the matcha was very washed out which is why I gave 3.5 stars. I'm pretty sure that their original egg waffles would be 4 star at least.   Plus, the couple is just so sweet and i just find the whole atmosphere and place really adorable, so I couldn't help but give this cute local business 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here to try the waffles and ice cream tonight. There was a special, 2 waffles for $5. Then you could select different flavours of ice cream to go to with it.  Total worked out to $11 for two waffles and ice cream - pretty reasonable compared to some other places.   I got the waffle with matcha ice cream, while my daughter got the waffle with chocolate ice cream.  The waffle was delicious, very light and crispy. The ice cream was a yummy complement to the waffle.   A bonus is the owners are super friendly and accommodating.  We had a nice conversation with them while waiting, which was not too long!  Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Expanded menu from the last time i visited. They not only have the hk style egg waffles, theyre now also serving thai rolled ice cream and pizza or smore egg waffles. Theres a lot of new flavours for the egg waffles. Plus you can add ice cream on your egg waffle and make it a cute panada dessert lol  I went with hk milk tea flavour and pork floss seaweed egg waffles today. The pork floss is my all time favourite. I can taste a very subtle light milk tea flav for the other one, it was ok but i dont see myself getting it again. Im very interested in trying the durian, nutella, oreo, ferrero rocher, rose infused, squid ink, kimchi etc hahaaha all of it. Ill slowly come back for a different flavor everytime :p  Its located on the second floor of a mall above T&T. Some the parking lot was super busy on a saturday. But theyre the only store that has a crowd among all the stores lol"}
{"text":"Actually the quality of the egg waffles maintain as good as usual. It has egg flavour and the spongy texture. It is still my go-to place for egg waffle. They are having special $5 for 2 Original waffles. It's good to get 2 because they are too good to just have 1.   They offer more variety and creative snacks like egg waffle pizza, Thai ice cream roll. I haven't tried them yet."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located in Langham Plaza, on the 2nd floor, right next to the escalators. There were plenty of free parking spots in the underground parking lot.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 The staff were very friendly and I felt a sense of warmth because the Asian couple that ran this business was so genuinely kind.   [DÉCOR] - 3.5/5  Cute and small. A crowd of people formed outside as they waited for their orders. Nonetheless, I had fun as I was intrigued by the extensive list \"unique\" items on the menu like egg waffle pizzas & kimchi egg waffles.   [QUALITY] - 3/5 I ordered the egg waffle to try the most quintessential item on the menu, but the quality was just average.   [ORDER] - 3/5 - Original Egg Waffle - $3.00: I prefer egg waffles to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This one was a little too hard overall and not soft on the inside. In terms of flavour, it actually had the perfect amount of sweetness.   [OVERALL] - 3/5 Unfortunately, the original egg waffle was just average. I'm sure it would be better when paired with funky toppings because that's what makes Toast Delight unique. I would definitely give this place a second chance and try those items as well."}
{"text":"Cute little (and I mean really little) shop run by a lovely couple. Located on the upper level of the T&T plaza, you'll find this place as soon as you turn right and down the corridor after coming up the escalators. Note: there's no seating available, except a few chairs while you wait for your order.   Since the plaza itself still has a number of empty units, not many people may know of this place, but that's actually one more reason that make this place a hidden gem. While many might resort to market village or pmall for egg waffles, you might wanna give this place a visit if you haven't already, especially when it's not that far from market village/pmall anyway.   Ever since their opening, their menu has been growing pretty steadily, from the basic waffle, to having various flavours of ice cream, to different toppings like lap cheung and seaweed and pizza. Savoury or sweet, the choice is yours.  Pricewise is pretty much the same as their competitors, but I guess their advantage is their range in variety.  Speed of service... not gonna lie, it does take a bit of time, especially if it's only one person working. But, on a cold winter's day, having a nice warm egg waffle is a good way to beat the cold weather!"}
{"text":"Today I went grocery shopping at T&T and stopped by Toast Delight upstairs.  Located by the corner shop when you turn right on the escalators, it's a really small shop that can only hold about 3 people max. It's sort of like a takeout joint, so there was a small line outside the shop when I arrived. It's $3 for one egg waffle and $5 for two so I got two. $3 extra for icecream. No tax. I like how they have specialty flavours of egg waffles. I had the red bean waffle and the pork shreds. The red bean was okay-la.. Soft, but probably not the best combination. The pork shred one was good; flavourful and crispy, although I prefer my eggies to be soft. Both were hot and fresh. It took about 10 mins to make so walk around the empty mall lolol. Owner is very friendly. Overall, the egg waffles were not bad."}
{"text":"Overall giving this place a 3 star! It's really good but the idea is similar to a lot of other Asian dessert places.   Pizza HK waffle- quite interesting! I enjoyed it a lot. Sweet and savoury at the same time. Got 6 cheese with pepperoni. Took about 10 mins to make. Heated & baked! Yummy!   Sesame ice cream with sesame HK waffle- pretty good! Sesame ice cream is always my favourite! Sesame HK waffle a little bit over done, but great with a crisp on the outside soft on the inside. My favourite of the day.   Thai taro rolled ice cream- meh. Was not a fan at all. Didn't even finish it. The hype was too much. If I had the chance to go back I wouldn't order it. Made with fresh taro and milk, bland in flavour and very pasty. Was not a fan at all. Don't recommend it.   Overall- would defiantly go back for the pizza and the HK waffle with ice cream! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The best egg waffles in Markham!  I come here all the time with my friends and always have a nice chat with the owner! :) He's super friendly and it's always nice to chat with him. He's really passionate with what he does and genuinely wants to know his customers better.  He doesn't make buns daily anymore, but you can order it from him as long as it's at least a day before!   My personal favorite is green tea and pork floss & seaweed, but all of them taste good! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I came here after already having a fulfilling dinner. We got the original egg waffle with matcha ice cream. The old couple behind the counter were so sweet and kind. They made our waffle fresh and chatted with us while we waited. Simplicity works for this kind of business. There are not a lot of seating in or around the store, but there's nothing wrong with just standing and picking at the egg waffle. for $3 they provide 2 big scoops of ice cream. They offer lots of flavours for their egg waffles and lots of ice cream flavours as well. FYI - They do not offer soft serve here."}
{"text":"I have finally found my egg waffle haven. Although this place is nicely hidden upstairs in Langham Mall, the powerful smell will direct and lead you to find this place once you get up the escalator. Must try... Their egg waffles. Then the Thai Ice cream roll. Both the sweet and savory egg waffles taste good. Depending on your taste buds, durian, hk milk tea is my favourite.  They make it fresh at every order. Thumbs up to the owners who are so accommodative as I even tried ordering mixing durian and red bean egg waffle. Love this place! Only wish that it'll be closer to downtown."}
{"text":"Pizza egg waffle ($8.88) Combo comes with a can of coke, $10 after tax. Should I say its a new way of eating egg waffles, or a new way of eating pizza? Very innovative of them to serve egg waffles like a pizza - the crust being the dough of the pizza. Tastes really good hot. It's loaded with cheese, and I asked for all the meats so it had pepperoni, bacon, and sausage! One thing I didn't like was how the slices aren't like a pizza slice. It's sliced that way, but it breaks into its egg waffle pieces when you eat it so it's actually quite messy. Had to wait quite a long time (around 20 mins) since it was being made fresh on the spot and had to be baked. Probably better off calling and ordering in advance and going there just to pick it up to avoid waiting.  I've came here like a year ago, I tried the 3 cheese (mozzarella, monterey jack, and jalapeno) and the green tea flavor. The three cheese was very interesting because it had a good kick in each bite. I thought the green tea one was slightly bitter and not much of my liking. I didn't eat them right away and waited approximately 20 mins later when it wasn't nice and hot, which was a mistake because it tasted horrible cold. The batter of the waffle was too thick and dense so it ended up tasting really chewy as opposed to being airy, fluffy and crispy how it should be. I do give them credit for their innovative flavors though. But after coming back, it seems like they've improved their waffles and added a lot of new things on their menu. More ingredients and interesting flavors - definitely trying to compete with Woofles & Cream."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of woofles and cream but unfortunately it was closed today. My girlfriend specifically wanted the waffle+icecream kind of dessert so we searched on Yelp for another option nearby. Came across this place and we are glad we did!   It was a bit hard to look for the store as there's so many stores in and outside the mall, but it's inside the mall on the right when you go up the escalators. It's a small store meant for take out, no tables to sit down.   The store's owned by a couple and my girlfriend thought they were adorable. They were very sweet. They guessed it was our first visit and helped us choose flavours. There is a bunch of flavour waffles! From HK milk tea to kimchi flavour, it was tough to choose which one. We got the HK waffles with matcha icecream. The waffles were a bit hard but it was still good regardless. The matcha icecream was AMAZING- great texture and perfect sweetness. One of the best I've tasted. It came to $7.50 for one. It's made fresh to order and takes around 5 minutes to be ready."}
{"text":"There was a bit of hype about this place so I was excited to try it out. I managed to get there in time to order an original egg waffle and the last red bean egg waffle of the day.   It took about 10 minutes for my egg waffles to be made. I didn't eat it fresh as I was taking it to my sister's place to share.  It's a neat little shop that also sells buns and snacks like curry fish balls.  Anyway, $5 for 2 egg waffles. As most people have said there's a bit of a crunch to the exterior and the inside is a little more dense than what you're used to with egg waffles. What makes the place interesting is the types of egg waffles flavours. the red been one was not bad, and there is some orange peel flavouring to go along with it as well which i wasn't expecting.  overall, it didn't amaze me, but i'd certainly go back and try the other flavours."}
{"text":"This cute little shop is located on Hwy 7/ Kennedy, the same plaza where the T&T supermarket is. Very convenient, makes you want to go grab a treat before you go home after grocery shopping. They always have the deal of 2 original egg waffles for $5. However, the egg waffles were not as crispy as the ones I have had in my childhood. It was a bit too soft on the outside. Other flavours available to choose from. If you are not a fan of egg waffles (i mean, how can you not), you can try their Thai Rolled Ice Cream. Like almost all Thai ice cream place, they make it on the spot. I have tried their ice cream before, it was very creamy and tasted just like any other ice cream. Though there are many flavours to choose from and good for social media pics, I would not order it often because if it is just like every ice cream out there, why would I pay extra $$ to get a fancier version?"}
{"text":"I got the HK milk tea rolled ice cream ($7.50 flat) on a recent visit. I really like this family-run store on the second floor of Langham Square. This is a take-out place with limited seating in the mall. I like that this ice cream has a rich milk tea flavour; it is sweet but has a slightly bitter aftertaste from the tea. At the end, whatever is melted just tastes like a cold milk tea. There was a bit of an oily feel on my lips too, so the fat content in this ice cream is a bit high. The price is also a bit higher than usual for what you get because the only add-on option is whipped cream and no other toppings."}
{"text":"This place has the best egg waffles with many choices of different flavours and. Ow thy serve Thai rolled ice cream always love to come here"}
{"text":"Jumping off the GO Train and WALKINGto my car every day of the work week (shoutout to all the walkers), around mid-week I often head to the nearby T&T for pick-me-up dinners and drive straight home to eat it.  Today I was a bit like a starving dog when I got off the train so when I got to the supermarket, I went upstairs to try Toast Delight as suggested by a good friend.  Small little space as you can see from the photos published here, but never judge a store by it's cover right?  I ordered the Original flavour egg waffle and the green tea flavour egg waffle.  Unlike Tung Tung Dan Quen King at the other other chinese malls, the egg waffle at Toast delight is piping hot, made fresh, and tastes like a crispy brittle but solid texture on the outside, with a densely packed batter on the inside.  Traditionally the egg waffle should be \"light and fluffy\" on the inside, but not everyone enjoys it that way.   The owner is pleasant, actually asked me if I just got off work.  The unnecessary and surprising delight of such a question suddenly made me realize that small touches like that which show a desire to connect with the customer is really critical and effective; that alone makes me an instant repeat-customer. If Toast Delight ever becomes monstrous and busy in the near future, I hope they don't lose that touch and ensure their future employees will be hired based on a genuine ability to be nice to people.  When you're hungry and want to have a satisfying snack packed with flavour, substance, and not feel like you ate \"air\"...this is the waffle for you."}
{"text":"Travelled a far distance to come try their egg waffles and ice cream it was worth it and very savoury. I bought the ube egg waffle with taro ice cream and black sesame."}
{"text":"Long story short, I thought this location was in Pacific Mall, I was way off haha. Anyways, my friend and I went here at around 6pm and there was only one group of people in line in front of us. I ordered the original bubble waffle with French vanilla and matcha ice cream for $6. My friend got the ube flavored bubble waffle with black sesame ice cream for $9. It was really filling since there was 2 scoops of ice cream and the bubble waffle tasted like any other standard egg waffle. I am glad I got to try this place but I don't think I would come back since it is a bit pricey and it's really far for me. Service was on point though!"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Interesting flavours of waffles and ice cream.  Flavours are always on point and tasty. 2. Nice presentation.   Neutral: 1. Thai rolled ice cream style is not the easiest to eat as it's very flaky.  The way it's built and presented also hinders tidy consumption.  Worth it? It's ok for the odd treat.  Takes about 5 minutes to make the ice cream so be prepared to wait.  Ice cream places on Main St. Unionville might be better bang for buck."}
{"text":"As Nat T said, it's a small little shop on the second floor above the T&T. As you walk up the escalators, you can smell the aroma of egg waffles - follow that smell and you'll find it just fine. If not, take the first right.  We got the Pepperoni Pizza egg waffle - something that I would never put together, but it works! For $10, it's a bit pricey but it's just something you have to try at least once if you like egg waffles. I feel like this would be a perfect \"broke college/university student\" dish.  The owners are also really cute and I can't help but want to support their business! Would come back to try their red velvet egg waffle and their thai ice cream!"}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed given all the good ratings on yelp.  First off, this little store is in the middle of nowhere. The 'mall' that it is in is largely full of empty units that have yet to be rented out. The plaza itself is poorly designed and getting through the parking lot into the parking garage is a challenge.   We ordered a green tea waffle and a seaweed and pork shred waffle. Although both were made fresh to order, they were rough and stale-like in texture. Neither flavors were very apparent - some bites had me confused as to which was which."}
{"text":"3.5 star  Hong Kong Street Food is something I always missed and have craving for. Curry Fishballs, Egg Custard Waffles and more.. The smell of freshly made waffles is just so intoxicating!  Toast Delight, a newly opened Hong Kong Snack Shop might able to help if you have the same cravings as I do. Located on the second floor of the same Mall as T&T Unionville.  Egg Waffles $3 each or $5 for 2 in 8 different flavours including choice of original, matcha, red bean, sesame and even savory: Pork Floss & Seaweed.  Made to Order and it might take a while to be ready.   I ended up ordering the Original and Sesame and while I was waiting snacking on on some Curry Fish Balls ($1.50).  The verdict? Not bad but not really as good as the \"real\" thing. Just make sure you let it cool down so the outer layer would be crunchy while the interior nice and fluffy. The egg waffle a little bit too dense for my liking but still good stuff.  Curry Fish Balls was so so. The curry taste was not too intense. But not bad as a snack!  Toast Delight also has over 20 different types of freshly baked buns which can also be pre ordered to guarantee freshness!  Closes on Tuesdays.  P.S. My coworkers did comment that these Egg Waffles tastes much better than Dong Dong at Pacific Mall/Market Village. So definitely worth giving them a try!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get delicious and Instagram-worthy desserts. Part of the experience is just talking to the adorable elderly couple who owns this place - they are so sweet and friendly!!! I've never come during a time when they were super busy, so I can't even imagine what that might be like... given that they make the waffles to order so there's a 10 minute wait even if there's no other customers in front of you. Just something to keep in mind. But other than that, I think it's awesome that they have so many different options of waffles and ice cream, and now they even do the thai ice cream rolls (which I don't particularly like but I had to try just because of the hype.) Plus if you're in the mood for something savoury, they have the waffle pizza, which in terms of taste is quite unique (a hint of sweetness from the waffle), and perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, BUT it's cool and innovative. Plus again, they let you customize it however you like. What with the amount of options, you can come here again, and again, and again, and always try something new. I just like that they are trying to be so creative and innovative and keeping up with all the food trends popping up these days. Their store also happens to have great lighting for you to take photos of your treats, so clearly they've thought of everything. :P"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm so happy that I decided to make a pit stop here tonight.   To be honest, the original plan was to go to Woofles and Creme, however upon arrival, they were closed!! I quickly opened up Yelp and this place came up as a suggestion. I looked into the reviews and it was really good, so I thought, why not? To start off, looks can be deceiving! This is a tiny shop located in the Langham Square building, on the second floor. There was a really friendly couple, and I believe their daughter.   I ordered the nutella waffle with french vanilla ice-cream, and my boyfriend got the ferraro rocher waffle with french vanilla ice-cream. WOW is definitely the word. Both of them were delicious and we were both happy that we tried this place! However.. I did end up switching with my boyfriend. The ferraro rocher waffle with french vanilla ice-cream was too good!  If I'm in the area and I'm craving waffles with ice-cream, I will definitely be back. Amazing service and dessert."}
{"text":"The couple who own this place are so friendly. I got the original waffle with Oreo Thai rolled ice cream and it was delicious. The ice cream was really flavourful and at first I thought the waffle was too crunchy, but it was actually pretty soft. You get a lot for what you pay for and it's definitely a really interesting concept. I was surprised by the amount of variety they offered for such a small place."}
{"text":"Came into this little ice cream shop cus of my niece.  The owners are this cute old Chinese couple who are super friendly.  They have lots to choose from and also some crazy flavours like squid ink Thai ice cream rolls.  I'm not sure if I would ever try it.  Ice cream is yummy, waffle is yummy and the owners are awesome.  I'd come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"They have durian egg waffles so my life is complete.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - the durian flavour was subtle, present enough, and didn't overpower the taste of the egg waffle while retaining the crispy-on-the-outside and soft-creamy texture on the inside.  Toast Delight is constantly mixing up new concoctions to the art of egg waffles and this is one of their newer additions. Their menu have grown extensively so there's plenty of sweet and savoury options to choose from! I'm so excited to come back and build my own egg waffle!"}
{"text":"Toast Delight: the better Bang Bang of Markham. I recently found out about this place and I'm surprised they don't have more hype. It's a small little shop on the second floor of T&T on the right hand side. Unfortunately their location is poor because I would have never known they were there. I hope they are able to move to somewhere better so they can have actual seating and people can see it better. It is run by a cute, elderly, Asian couple who are literally the sweetest people ever. They make you feel very welcome and urges you to take photos and displays the food nicely.   Note: they say they close at 8, but when we called, he said 8:30 and \"...maybe 9\" which made us laugh. Funny guy. So call before going after 8, they might still be open!  The food: the amount of flavours of waffles are insane. They have the regular flavours, Asian flavours, sweet flavours, and super experimental flavours such as squid ink and durian. I got the coffee and milk tea mix flavour with matcha ice cream. I would say the waffle is slightly overdone, but you can really taste the flavour and you can see that everything is fresh and made to order. The ice cream was good. Not mind blowing but it complimented the waffle very well. I never noticed but you could also ask for two different flavours of ice cream and it's the same price! My order came to about $7.50 and I would say that's not bad. My friend ordered a pizza waffle and that was a very interesting and delightful experience as well.   5/5. I love this couple and I love the menu. I'm excited to try more flavours and more combinations! Definitely coming back if I have the chance."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is owned by an old man and his wife warms my heart. It's so cute! I called in ahead of time to order my pizza, pork floss, and 3 cheese egg waffles as I was coming in from work. He said it would be finished in 15 mins which was perfect by my schedule. Last minute check for Yelp tips, I found that they only took cash so I had to make a trip to the nearest bank, only to be delayed by the traffic. I hoped my waffles weren't cold by the time I reached there since I was about ten minutes late.   Luckily, I got there and found my waffles still fresh and hot. Order of three came to $19.50. Decent price considering one is a full meal for me. They also pitched in a free can of coke.   Service was great! The owner is super friendly and though I saw the wife briefly, she was all smiles which was nice after an entire morning of endless tutoring.   Next, my waffles. Sadly, I wasn't too impressed with the pizza. The 3 cheese was okay, I wouldn't get it again. But! The pork floss became my personal favourite. Would definitely get that again.   Overall I'd give this place a 3.5, but I don't mind rounding it to a 4 considering it's a one-man business. You can really see the love put into his work!"}
{"text":"This shop is a real local charm. Albeit small, they have a large variety of sweet and savoury egg waffles and ice cream. It was so hard to choose when everything sounded so delicious!  The shop is pretty small but that's what gives it charm. The owners are sweet and had huge smiles on their faces the entire time. Super friendly! The egg waffles are perfectly crispy on the outside and soft/warm on the inside, just the way it should be. It also had the perfect \"thickness\" (if you can call it that). I've tried other egg waffle places where the egg waffle was too thick and chewy - not my taste!  I think the prices are pretty reasonable in the realm of egg waffle shops in Markham. This one is definitely in my top three and I will continuously return to try the many flavours."}
{"text":"Up the elevator and located on the right side of the mall. Even without a huge sign it was easy to spot. Checked out the menu for a bit and there was a lot of different waffles to choose from. From sweet red velvet to savoury 6 cheese. The choices of waffles and ice creams were definitely more than the other waffle place nearby. Came for the pizza egg waffle so the rest will have to wait.  The pizza egg waffle takes 20 minutes to prepare. There were three chairs to sit on inside the store. When the egg waffle came out, the owner put it on a metal rack. Perfect time to take some pictures, the owner was so impressed he took one too. He said to tell him when it's okay to add the finishing touches. He puts it in an actual pizza box and cuts it up until six slices. The mixed meat had a good amount of toppings and cheese. Only complaint would be the tomato sauce, tasted like those lunchable sauces.  Overall, will definitely come back to try a sweet egg waffle and possibly to get the pizza waffle again. Really nice owner and a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Got the kimchi waffle today and it was good! Each \"bubble\" had a good bit of kimchi in it, with a good balance of sweet and salty. I just wasn't sure if it was worth $5.50 for it being a gourmet waffle. The owners (husband and wife) are really friendly to talk to!"}
{"text":"Their bubble waffle is always good and the owners are super friendly! My favourite to-go bubble waffle place whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Toast Delight is a combination of sweet kind-hearted owners with the bonus of a delicious dessert. If you like warm egg waffle that crunches when you bite into it (made fresh) and creamy flavourful ice cream filling, you want to go here! It's a small place tucked away on the second floor of the mall in the t&t plaza at the corner of Kennedy and Unionville gate. We really enjoyed the service and dessert!! Will be going again soon!"}
