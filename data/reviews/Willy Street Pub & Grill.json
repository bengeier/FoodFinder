{"text":"The wisco is actually the only place that I feel at home. Anyone that says otherwise is actually not mentally capable of having fun. They have excellent burgers and beers. Try it out or die lonely."}
{"text":"It's your standard dive bar. I had a perfectly fine time there with my wife. It was a Saturday night and we both can say we were pleased with the tap beer selection. I won't knock on it for being a bit dingy as that's what gives it charm and even adds to the welcoming atmosphere. They have a (very small) volleyball court that seemed to allow pickup games. The outdoor area was small but had a solid amount of seating. It's location on Willie street makes it a great spot to go for when you want to put your name in at one of the restaurants (waits are often 40+ minutes on Saturday night) and have a drink before going to dinner. It got quite loud, there was a high number of... frat-type guys hanging out and getting a bit loud and belligerent. It wasn't excessively bothersome but it did knock it down a bit for my preferences. They also only accept cash which made it hard for us to stay very long. You'll not be disappointed here but you also will not be overly-thrilled. I will return."}
{"text":"This place used to be the shit when Marty worked there. He was the best bartender in town........If Shane (Sharky) still works there, hes a good shit, and deserving of your money,so tip him you cheap piece of slag. JSYK, this is a whisky and beer bar,( or at least it was) so dont order some bullshit, or youre likely to get laughed at, or just ignored period. Ahhh, nothing like the good old days, sitting out back at the Wisco with friends,enjoying a beer and a Wisconsin summer evening,then someone puke's."}
{"text":"Wisco so much the same only not so much.
 GoodPeople to sit and have a wee one or 
  A bite with me.
Tiny Ryan Brooks Brooke and company
 Will bring a smile to your face along with
 Your favorite beverage And they'll cook,too."}
{"text":"Yey Wisco!  Fun people, great prices for drinks, and even better music.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I no longer frequent the WISCO due to the regulars who think they can harass and threaten visitors. I enjoyed seeing many fantastic bands in their totally inappropriate for live music space, but no lineup has yet to get me back in the door. A dive bar is one thing, but the threat of violence is too high in the last few years. Ironic since it used to be a biker bar."}
{"text":"It's tough for me to write a one star review sometimes. I'll try to be brief.

I was somewhat impressed when I first walked in. $1.50 Pabst, a nice guy wearing a snood at the end of the bar, and a small crowd inside. The bartender was nice, but it was all downhill from there. It was dirty, low ceiling-ed, and torn up. A busser's tray laid on the floor to catch the leak in the ceiling and a thick layer of grime was just about everywhere. No such thing as waitstaff. The interior was hot and stuffy, with no opened windows to let in some cool night air.

The patio outside looks out over the street corner and the high fence makes it feel instead like a prison yard. People are jumping an 8-foot high fence to get in and out, most everyone is drinking from glass bottles despite the (totally unenforced) signs, and people are throwing crap in assorted directions when the bottles are empty. Again, it's dirty. 

The guys here...they're not hipsters. I know hipsters, and they're not like this. These are miscreants who enjoy their negativity and their anger. There's an undercurrent of aggression present that is predatory, yet false at the same time. It's a bro-ness that comes off as similar to a fraternity house, just with a different strata of people. 

Avoid. There' are better places to be.

P.S.: Ladies, there was another review on here that mentioned people getting dosed with royphenol and the patrons and staff being indifferent. That indicts everyone in the place. Don't come here; it ain't worth it."}
{"text":"Divest dive bar in madison. Cheap dirty and angry in a town full of clean shinny new P.C. Financial aid money. Good music, crazy people, not for the weak or those expecting fancy smancy waitstaff. 

Don't forget to tip a dollar a drink. It's only courteous."}
{"text":"You can find better places,  even better dive bars on Willy St. Not bad,  just nothing special at all. It's either your scene or it isn't. In short: just okay."}
{"text":"This is one of maybe 2 or 3 places in town to see the kinds of bands I like. The food is OK, and they have typical bar stuff - beer, booze. The venue itself seems like an invitingly typical dive bar. Crappy TV shows on all the time give it a kind of crummy sports bar feel at times - when it's not a game day they're still cranking FOX tv, which is sucky. I'd rather hear pretty much any kind of music over that crud. 

The main issue for me is, I didn't grow up in a suburban / college town, so I'm really put off by people getting \"ruffied\" here, and more so by the bland douchey \"what ya gonna do?\" response. After seeing one band's drummer's wife pass from being drugged (didn't finish her one drink, very sudden passing out & sickness, obviously drugged against her will - the next day when she could speak again, she was totally convinced this was the case) I was disgusted to hear various people say \"wow! again!?!?\" and gossip about who they though was doing it. Repeatedly. This was not anything like an isolated incident. Yet, No One DID anything; hipster bartender clucked his tongue - not his problem = not my scene. 

Stand up for yourself Madison, this is not how autonomous life works. Adults with any sense of honor or good sense don't shrug and go \"oh man, that sux!!!\" when this kind of thing happens in their space. Tattoos are not actually a worthwhile substitute for personal integrity, and / or balls, in most of the rest of the world. Watching my friends beat the tar out of a-holes for doing things no where near that obnoxious are some of my fonder music hall memories. (I know, not PC, eh Madison?) You don't have to do that, necessarily, but if you do NOTHING you're not a scene at all, just a group of people who happen to tend to buy the same products. F that. You don't care to take care of your own, you are no kind of rebel, you are the reason police exist; to deal with people who won't take personal responsibility. You're better than that, right? RETHINK. 

I'll stick to actual biker bars, and seeing bands in Chicago, or out in the sticks."}
{"text":"Okay fine, Wisco. You got me. People said you had one of the best burgers in town, and I was like, \"what.\" But when I came here with yet another friend who touted your burger was one of the best bar burgers, I knew I had to order one. And I did. And it was delicious. A thick juicy seasoned meat patty. I deleted the fried onions and added a fried egg, which had a perfectly soft yolk, making for a beautiful saucy burger. 

I am not really a dive bar person, and this is definitely a dive bar. Like, maybe the floor will have peanut shells and the tabletops may or may not be sticky kind of dive bar. I love that they fully embrace it. Staff was friendly and attentive. Seating was a little weird, and I would've preferred a nook somewhere that would've allowed me to converse more easily one on one with a friend."}
{"text":"If you love dive bars like I do, you'll really like this place.  Didn't sample the food--went for a Friday night show.  Didn't know the bands, but they were a lot of fun. Drinks were very reasonable (even cheap!). 
Music was a great volume--we could still hear each other talk over by the bar, which I love.
Only thing that sucks is it's cash only.  Parking's on the street, but that's the name of the game in this neighborhood.
Staff were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is sort of a time capsule.  Back in the mid 90's (shortly after it's name change from \"The Wisco\"), I used to shoot pool here and commiserate with the various regulars, discussing matters of the day.  While most of the patrons did have the kind of colorful past or modernized slang of the characters recalling other parts of the state,  there was a divey Wisconsin style \"realness\" to the place that is replaced with unsolicited pretension in the other establishments on this street, to say nothing of the Capitol Square.  Let's be clear, this is not a family place.  The lighting is poor, the menu is about as basic as you get, and patrons I witnessed on this visit would probably get as excited winning a meat raffle as you or I would winning Powerball.  I settled in and took up the bartender on his offer of a $1.50 Point Lager special for happy hour.  The Brewer game had just started (they later lost).  A random couple appeared out of nowhere and ordered some jello shots for someone's birthday.  I chose the cheeseburger with pepperjack and a small side of fries.  The whole arrangement came to just under $10 not including tip, which for downtown Madison is about as cheap as it gets these days.  The seeded bun was fresh, and the meat was piping hot as it had just come off the grill, accompanied by lettuce, a tomato slice and some fried onions.  Sadly, the decision of adding those extras resulted in a structural meltdown of the entire sandwich, leaving me to ask for more napkins.  All in all, an experience I might repeat, but not this week.  Make no mistake, there are no hipsters or even faux hipsters here, just real people drinking basic alcohol the way it used to be before all this craft cocktail bullshit hit the scene."}
{"text":"I adore this place. Inside is pretty roomy, and well equipped with foosball table, darts machine, a pool table, and coin slots. The outside has the nice sand volleyball court and some chill area. The biker (motorcycle) themed atmosphere is really rocking - I love the hard rock tunes played throughout the night. 

The bartender is very friendly, and so are the patrons. I will be back here for more low key night outs."}
{"text":"Why is this place called the Wisco? Sign outside says Willy St Pub....

Quintessential dive bar. Cheap drinks, decent bar food, dark and dingy, a couple tvs, loud bands, outdoor patio with volleyball! Cash Only!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, non-pretentious dive bar with cheap and good bar food, a charmingly wavy floor (hope you have good sea legs), and one of the last non-internet jukeboxes left in the city. I feel more comfortable here than almost any other tavern around--it isn't full of snotty, self-absorbed people using their cursed Iphones while sitting at a bar meant for socializing and meeting people. Ahh, how refreshing. So is this pint of Hopalicious. Lastly: this wi-fi connection is the only one I've used in the last week that hasn't puked every 10 minutes. Viva el fucking Wisco."}
{"text":"Its the Wisco.  I love this place.  Its the only place that while playing shows you can jump from table to table throwing chairs and no one cares.  And they have decent bar food as well!"}
{"text":"I like the Wisco, I don't love it but I would be damn unhappy if it ever closed down. Playing volleyball in the summer is tons o' fun. They always have good deals on cheap beer and strong mixed drinks. Also, they are one of very few places in town to put on rock shows even though they don't have a stage. Also, they only take donations so they turn out to be especially cheap rock shows with bands that would other wise be playing at larger venues but are simply looking for a change of scenery."}
{"text":"One of the best cheeseburgers in town can be found at the \"Wisco\".  There's a pool table, dart board and volleyball out back. The drinks are poured generously, and there is often a really cheap beer special going on."}
