{"text":"Wow, I am from Bay Area in US. But am visiting Canada. Loved the Dosa, which my Indian friend here took me to. I would try more in the Bay Area when I am back. Never tried this Indian food before."}
{"text":"My visit was really awesome. Food and customer service was fresh and fabulous respectively. Thank you so much Dosa Paradise I'm glad."}
{"text":"Nice place. Really good service. Very good dosa. Nice manager takes care of customers."}
{"text":"This is a great hole-in-the-wall place that is all vegetarian and has a lot of varieties of dosa with unlimited three types of chutneys and sambar. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good Food. I have mostly received good service at this restaurant. They make good dosas. The food is authentic South Indian. They offer these food combos that I usually prefer. Once we ordered their family dosa that was more than 2 feet and it was fun for everyone in our group. Overall, their prices are decent."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a restaurant that serves only dosas. The interior was pretty small which I didn't expect, so I suggest to call in for a reservation if you have a big group. We were lucky to get table for 6 without any wait.

We had ordered Chilly Idli, Idli, Rava Dosa, Family dosa (4 Feet), Chai, Mango Lassi, Masala Dosa. I fell in love with the Rava dosa because they had made that to perfection, I don't think the Rava dosa lacked anything, apart from the chutney being too sweet, for me atleast. (the quantity was less too). 

The most exciting part for me was the family dosa because I haven't tried a dosa that is 4 ft long. When I got my 4 ft dosa I was disappointed. It didn't seem to be 4 ft long, it definitely was smaller than that. Also it was paper thin and was very crispy. So, instead of this, the Masala dosa would be better.
The Mango Lassi was the worst from all that I had tried. It was sour. I told the server that I didn't like it so she didn't charge me for it. I appreciate that gesture. I usually don't like to send dishes or drinks back but that was so sour and lassi is meant to be sweet. I just had to return it.

To end my lunch experience, I ordered Masala Chai which saved the day. 

I don't mind coming to this place for the Rava Dosa but this wouldn't be my first choice.

Service: 2.0 ( It was pretty slow even though there weren't many people)
Food: 3.0 
Ambience: 2.0"}
{"text":"Good place. We came here because guru Lakshmi was packed. We weren't disappointed. Dosa was good, utthapam was okay. Here are some tips for them to get better:

1) better songs can increase romantic ambiance 
2) water could be cooler during summer Time
3) staff meetings can wait 
4) more chutneys with dosa please 
5) hanging lights would be good investment 
6) potato Masala should look yellowish

Can't wait to try their lunch thali"}
{"text":"On a rare occasion that I was in Brampton, I wanted to try something that I can't find downtown and I found this dosa place.  I've wanted to try dosas since seeing a YouTube video on how to properly eat them (with your right hand only without utensils), and found the perfect place to try this out.

The menu has all sorts of dosas imagineable, with all your standard ingredients, right down to a Hakka fusion version with chow mein inside the hot flakey dosa crust.

I got the combo with one mild dosa, and one chilli dosa with potato filling, with four chutneys.  I found my favourites were the masala for spicy, and the coconut one for when I wanted something refreshing.  The dosas were excellent, and I was able to practice my one handed eating technique.  Afterwards I washed the meal down with a cup of masala tea which had a mild flavouring of masala.  

If only this place were not so far away, I would make this a regular go to place."}
{"text":"This small location has limited seating but we had no wait on a Friday evening. Service is friendly and helpful with suggestions if you are new to Dosa's. Water was served right away without having to ask. Ambiance is simple but comfortable and functional with warm colours. The washrooms are sparse, but clean, accessible and well stocked.  For dinner we ordered the Paneer Masala Dosa (crepe stuffed with a sweet sauce, cheese, peppers, onions and herbs) and Vegetable Uthappam (peppers, onions and herbs in a pancake) at medium spicy with a mango lassi to drink. Great flavours all around and just the right amount of heat. We enjoyed the three chutneys (coconut, coriander and spicy tomato) and the spicy savoury Sambra that came with the meals.   Everything is vegetarian of course.  I thought the portions were just right. Eating with your hands is the accepted way to enjoy these meals, but you can get utensils if you like. Overall great experience and we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I love this place. Had their thali and its delish! And it's not too expensive. I often shy away from the thali because they are often too overpriced for how much they give. Too bad I don't live here otherwise I'll be here everyday. 
Good food and reasonable price. Combination you don't see often anymore. I hope they don't change like all the other ones that used to be good."}
{"text":"The dosas were freshly prepared. The combos were worth it. Kids enjoyed cheese dosa. The dhai vada was so so as it had onions. Service was so so as the food took a long time to arrive. Rasam was very tasty. Will go back again there is so much variety."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday during lunch time with my mom and her friend and her daughter. It's a small place but it seats about 30-40 people on an average day. The reason why we came here is for the special \"buy one dosa and get one half price\". We ended up ordering 3 masala dosa's and one plain dosa. The best way I can describe what a masala dosa is a mashed potato filling in a big crispy crepe and the plain dosa has no potato filling. They all come with a soup (sambar) and delicious chutneys. So we got our dosa's in 15 minutes and the lady happened to mess up the order and gave two masala dosa and two plain. When we told her we ordered another masala dosa she had no problem making another one and let us keep the plain dosa too. The foods very simple, typical south asian dish. I find it less oily than the other places. I felt like I could eat another dosa because it was so good. I will definitely come back to this place because it's a great deal for great food."}
{"text":"Good choices of dosa and other South Indian dishes. The prices are reasonably well. Atmosphere is okay but the main issue is the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything from the idli to the dosa to the chai was amazing. The onion pakora in particular was amazing. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Not sure if they got new owners or what but it's definitely not as good as it used to be. My first visit in 2014 left me speechless. Out was so good I was addicted. We had tried almost half the menu and loved everything. Fast forward to 2017. We could not wait a moment to come back here. We honestly thought we might eat here everyday while visiting. We went in and were disappointed. We got everything the same as the last time to find out that everything changed. The flavors, the filling and even the quality. Everything seemed to have nothing but onions. You order a dosa and the filling was almost all onions. Actually, everything we ordered had nothing but onions in it as if they're using it as a cheap filler. Needless to say we were very disappointed address waiting to come back for so long. I might go back in a few years of their still open just to see if we went on a bad day."}
{"text":"I loved the chilli cheese dosa - something I'd never even consider ordering but it looked totally delicious when it was served on a table nearby, so I ended up taking a risk and it paid off. It was the perfect mix of crunchy, spicy and gooey and it stayed like that until I finished it. The chutneys can be better but overall, a great experience and I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"It's an OK place. They need to step up their Sambar game as it's too weak even their coconut and tomato chutney is weak. All in all very average south Indian food. The cook is still an apprentice or an amateur level but have a potential to become way better."}
{"text":"One of the best dosa in town  been there so many time  Staff is so friendly   Food is always fresh  cheese paneer dosa  mouth watering  just wow wow wow  definitely going back !!"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5!!I hate being the lone dissenter.This place has been on my go to list for a very long time.I was very excited to try this place but I wasn't blown away by their food.

So I ordered the Mysore Dosa, the dosa itself was crispy and flavorful but the filing was so bland and so were the chutnies that came along.I felt Saravan Bhavan has better dosas.I also ordered rasam which is like a light soup with chilies and onions, it was spicy but not very delicious, I had a Indian friend with me who too said the food wasn't  outstanding.I take food feedbacks very seriously from people who talk about their cultural food..

The place itself it very non fancy, it's nice and clean but boy it's dark in there.We went there for lunch and they have all the shutters down in the restaurant and shutters too are dark brown for a bit I did feel claustrophobic in there.Owners- if you are reading this please let you customers enjoy some sunshine.

There is ample of parking in the plaza but mind you it's a busy plaza.The pricing is very reasonable we ordered 2 Mysore dosas and a rasam and the total with tax was around $22."}
{"text":"Dosa Heaven

Arun gave me a heads up on this place. Italians need the code to get in and I was given the secret knock, knock knock....wait then knock

Family owned by a brother and sister who work hard to please their customers and with a serious Dosa

They offer over 50 of them......

But wait....wallllyooooo....whats is that?

A Dosa is a rice batter based crepe like pancake served with various toppings like Sambhar or coconut chutneys.

Its a vegetarian offering for those that do not eat mutton

Do not waste your effort on the measly plain dishes but go full taste bud alert for these offerngs from the Dosa gods...

Paneer Masala Dosa...good but boring

Chile garlic Marsala Dosa.........the tongue will sing for you

Vada Sambhar Dosa .....

Karaikudi Masal Dosa.....whew it is the hottest of them all....wipe your face 7 times after this one.....you do need a towel

Order the Mango lassi to wash the heat away

Best to just ask Shiva for a sampler and go with a gang so you can munch on several types and maybe take a proper approach mild to wild...with over 50 to choose from the Dosa lover cannot ever go wrong at this place!"}
{"text":"After coming to terms with the closure of my usual dosa outlet, 'does palace' in Mississauga, I was in need of a new joint. A quick Yelp search brought up Dosa paradise. We came for lunch, the place is easy to find, lots of parking. Inside it is very clean, plenty of seating. Service is fast and polite. I can't say anything negative about this place. One thing, it is vegetarian, so if you are looking for hearty meat dish, look elsewhere

I had masala dosa at affordable price $6 ish. My partner had combo platter which includes two mini dosas. He thought his dosas tasted similar, potato based. My dosa was excellent flavor, as were the accompanying sauce/Dahl not sure what the name is of southern Indian dishes. I'm a northerner!

It's strange going to a new dosa place after visiting dosa palace so many times. The service was much faster here, and the place is very clean. I like these upgrades in my dosa dining experience 

Great food. Will return."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to dosas when a place called \"Dosa City\" opened up across the street from my parents' house. I'd never had dosas before or even heard of them but as soon as I gave it a try, I was pretty much hooked. The place made great South Indian food and I'd pop in at least a couple of times a month. Sadly I don't think many other people did because it was deserted half the time and despite a pretty good review in the Toronto Star, closed after probably a year and half or so. I've tried many other dosa places since but none of them quite match the dearly departed Dosa City as far as I'm concerned. Dosa Paradise? Well, it takes a good stab at it.

There aren't too many dosa huts in Mississauga (that I know of) and I had a hankering, plus I was in the area so I called ahead. Actually Dosa Paradise wasn't my first choice...I actually wanted to try Guru Lukshmi (had it once a few years back before they moved and expanded their menu) but when I tried to call ahead and place a take-out order I was rather brusquely put on hold, transferred to someone else and then promptly put on hold again...for over five minutes. Forget it. Dosa Paradise was next on the list and while perhaps they're not as fancy or gourmet as Guru Lukshmi, at least they seemed to appreciate my business. I actually had more time to spare than I thought when I got there so I dined in. No problem at all, they were happy to accommodate me. Service both at the cash and at the table was incredibly friendly. 

As for the dosa itself, I went with the Coriander Chilli Masala Dosa ($7.95 and quite massive). The flavour and spice level was good (I could certainly taste the coriander), as was the consistency. Not too soft and doughy and not too crispy and overdone. Also I think I prefer the style of dosa that is more of a roll rather than folded over but so far as I can ascertain this may be a take-out versus dine in thing...I usually get them to go and the odd times that I do eat them in the restaurant they seem to be assembled in a slightly different fashion. If I'm wrong, someone please enlighten me!

My meal came with three very tasty chutneys (coconut, cilantro and a spicy red pepper) and an especially good Sambar soup on the side. A lot of places seem to dial in the Sambar but I made note of how good Dosa Paradise's was (and made sure to compliment them on it). Also props for offering to top me up when I was close to running out of chutneys...I think I use more than the average person.  

I may not be in Brampton that often but I will be back to Dosa Paradise. I still want to give the new Guru Lukshmi a try but if they don't get their act together and treat my call as even something of a priority I may have to make Dosa Paradise my exclusive provider in the area. Still miss Dosa City though."}
{"text":"Wow, I used to work only two kms away from this place and never knew it was here. Thank you to the reviewer with the FTR for making it known! 

On my first visit I took notice that the dining room was clean and the employee friendly. Their prices are very respectable and I took advantage of their special \"combo 1\". It was quite filling, actually enough food to feed two people in my opinion, And if I would order it for take out I'd probably order a side item with it and have it as two meals. 

The chutneys and the Mysore Masala dosas were wonderfully spiced. I thought the regular Masala dosa fell a little short and the sambar was fine flavor-wise but I prefer it prepared with veggies and spices to sink my teeth into. Theirs is finely pureed. No big deal, just a matter of preference. 

If I find myself in this area again I will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They don't cater even a bit to customer's request. Just asked for a different table as it was too hot for me to bear the sun on my face on a hot day like today. Flatly  kept denying upon requesting more than once. So just walked out!! Some amateur waitress!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here and ordered multiple dosas. All were good. As a south indian, I know about good dosas. 
The sambar was more of a gujarati cooking style than a typical chennai style. But definitely went well with the dosas. They do have a large variety in dosas.
Only thing that could be better is the portions of the chutneys could be more."}
{"text":"I'm on a business trip in the Toronto area so came here with a local friend. I don't recommend this place and my friend says there are better places nearby! I like that they offer fusion dosas that are chinese and mexican. But the masala dosa I got was just okay. It was kinda small. And the chutneys are a bit watery as if they are trying to save money by diluting them.  Also, service was slow and the waitress was kinda rude. Like she didn't want to be there and didn't care at all about customers. I usually don't care that much about service if the food is good but something about the service was just off."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! That's the only word for Dosa Paradise. I've had Dosa all over the world including Chennai, and this place is right up there in quality."}
{"text":"Very good place. I had a combo here and it was perfect for my lunch. Rightly priced too. Dosas, sambhar and chutneys were all tasty. Authentic. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best dosa restaurant in the GTA..truly lives up to is name! I have been visiting this place for the past couple years and it has been consistently good. They have great combo specials which include an idli and vada appetizer, two dosas, and a pop. It is really affordable compared to other dosa restaurants. The specials run every day even on weekends before 6 pm. 
The service is friendly and fast. Each dosa comes with three different chutneys and a bowl of sambhar. You can request for more chutney if you like a particular one and the staff will happily bring it out to you. It is worth driving to Brampton just to have the dosa here. This is my go to place for south Indian food and I can see that it will be in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"It definitely does not define South Indian food in many of its things they have on menu.  Even simple things like the chutney are their own concoction with no taste.  I would not waste my money here.  Idli seems to come from the fridge and reheated.  I donot know why but everything felt as if it was watered down."}
{"text":"After eating here a few times I can say I really enjoy the food. Many options and the price affordable. I will say the service could be a little better especially around filling up water and bringing out everyones food at the same time. Worth checking out if you love Southern Indian food."}
{"text":"My husband said we needed to rest our guts from eating the usual Chinese /Japanese/Korean foods for our end -of-the- week  treat... So we came to this place to try something out.
We came at a good day for the Thursday special. The dosas were crispy- thin and savoury. The chutneys were the right combo of flavours to balance out the spiciness of the potato fillings of the dosas. I liked the coconut chutney the most (not just because it was sweet),  it was like having dessert at the same time while eating the crispy dosas.
The interior of the place was chill, casual. Service was prompt.Price affordable. Coffee was ok.
p.s. bathroom was well-maintained"}
{"text":"My favourite dosa place of all time. The food tastes amazing especially the sambar all for an affordable price range. The only negative aspect of the restaurant is the wait, it takes about 20-40 minutes to actually have your food on the table. But for the price and taste it's a sacrifice I'm willing to take."}
{"text":"Very slow service,not good food,they take forever to get you're food to table,would not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Dosa - Think savoury, crispy crepe stuffed with a mashed potatoes/onions/spices mixture.

I've been to Guru Lukshmi and have had Dosa Paradise bookmarked for a while now. Décor-wise, Guru is more upscale with contemporary wallpaper, dimmer with chandeliers.  The clientele though is definitely more casual.  Dosa Paradise is more diner-y.  Very casual, under 10 tables, smaller restaurant.

Prices reflect décor.  Dosas from Guru are around $11, whereas Dosa Paradise's priciest dosas are just under $12 and average ones are like $8-9.  

Portions at both restaurants are HUGE.  It is manageable as the stuffing isn't throughout the entire dosa, but if your appetite isn't that big, you may want to consider sharing.  Both restaurants come with 3 different kinds of chutneys (coriander, coconut, & another spicy one) AND sambar.

I believe the sambar at Guru was more a reddish tone, whereas the one at Dosa Paradise was more yellowish and tasted as though lentils/yellow daal was used for the base.  Sambar at Dosa came piping hot and quite spicy!

My Sri Lankan friend & I ordered:  Chettinad & Karaikudi Dosa and the waitress warned us that the Karaikudi was spicy, but we thought we'd take a chance.  Boy, she wasn't kidding!  I only sampled the Karaikudi and it felt like my mouth was gonna fall off!  It was soo uber-spicy, it made my nose water.  Apparently, the Karaikudi was the spiciest one available!

Skip the Green Chilli Banjiis.  They were whole green chillis and quite greasy.  Not my thing.  They should've been drained off on a paper towel before serving.  Also skip the Masala Tea.  Tasted sorta like a HK milk tea.  I didn't taste any \"masala\" whatsoever, just black tea.

Tip:  Restaurant is fully vegetarian.

Downfall:  Wait-time.  It took approx. 30mins for us to receive our order.  That is quite a long time, considering that there's isn't a lot of cooking involved."}
{"text":"Dosa paradise.

Dosa is like the Indian version of a crepe. Normally eaten by dipping into a flavorful 'sauce'. (Like nachos and cheese dip)

This place has a huge variety of different dosas  (savory & sweet). They can vary based on style (please see pictures/my apologies in advance for the poor shots). Some can be very spicy while others mild. Some can be unique (french fries dosa?!?).

I have tried a few here and there and yes it is delicious. 

My recent trip I tried the karaikudi kada masala dosa. It is a crepe stuffed with potatoes and karaikudi masala. It was spicy and tasty. I also got 2 plain crepes to take home as well. 

If you are looking for authentic Indian dosa, come here. You get a variety and won't be disappointed.

Deals:
Thursday: buy 1 get 2nd half off."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonably priced. Fresh cooking. Neat and clean with average ambience.great deals on combos and Thursday specials. 15 item thali is a steal. Wait time is pretty high. Didn't like the sambhar much. Will be back for the thali."}
{"text":"great place - in a not so conspicuous location, looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but is bigger on the inside

idli in sambar is a hit - perfectly made
vada is good too
dosa is real treat - the sambar is great!

ambience: clean and modern

now: how do they become 5 stars? the chatni- don't do it with dried coconut. use raw coconut instead and this will be perfect."}
