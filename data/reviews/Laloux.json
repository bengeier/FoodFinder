{"text":"In the heart of French Canada, it's rare to find a true glass of milk from my European mother's teet.  Alas, I believe I found it at laloux. A quaint French restaurant with elegant flair and creative dishes like goat-cheese cheesecake, that's right I wrote goat cheese!  My husband and I had dinner there for the first time last night and magnifique is too plain a word to describe our experience.   The tenderloin and the cheesecake are a must!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and great service.  We had the beef tartar apetizer and then the flank steak and the scallops for our main courses, then lemon tart and dulce creme for dessert.  Everything was good and very beautifully presented.  Unfortunately though I have to agree with a previous reviewer who commented that there is just too much going on in the food.  Too many flavors in each dish - it almost overwhelms the beautiful, perfectly cooked scallops when there are golden raisins randomly floating in the nutmeg almond sauce!  The food alone set us back nearly $200, which is too much for the overdesigned meals, even though well-prepared."}
{"text":"Do not dine at this restaurant. Period. After arriving in Montreal from NYC, this was the first meal for my daughter and I. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant... may be 5 other tables! So why was the food so mediocre (deer tartare wasn't bad), but we waiting over an hour for our mains to come out and my daughter and I couldn't eat it. The food was over cooked (she had the Seafood Ravioli and I had the Cod).... Plain disaster. I waited way too long for a wine menu to order new wine and ended up giving up. Settled the bill and left hugely disappointed. Frankly, I'm more upset with myself for disregarding the many negative recent reviews. How the hell did this place get a 4.5 Yelp Review????"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 2 at 5:30pm through Opentable, and when we arrived, we were the first customers of the evening, which we didn't particularly mind. Coat check was provided which was nice, and we were quickly seated at one of the tables in the very back which seemed reserved for those who made reservations. I could be wrong.  Upon being seated, we were immediately asked what we wanted to drink. When asked for sparkling water, we were given a choice between traditional bottled or in-house made sparkling water. Hubby left the choice up to me, so I chose traditional bottled and we were given Eska Sparkling Water.  Immediately upon ordering, we were brought warm bread and salted butter. Not too long after, our appetizers were brought to us. Little did we know how surprised we would be!  It was my first time having cold foie gras, and after trying it, now I know that I prefer my foie gras cooked hot. However, it was a great experience trying it, and when the foie gras was tasted with all the other ingredients of the dish together, it was tremendously well balanced, full of flavour and texture. There was no WOW factor, but that's only because I personally don't like cold foie gras. When eaten together with the apple, cranberry puree and honey, the taste of the foie gras was balanced out well, and the almonds provided the crunchy texture opposite of the foie gras. Overall, I enjoyed my appetizer and would recommend it to others that enjoy foie gras. I don't think I would personally order it again, but that's only because I want to try other appetizers on the menu!  Their desserts were phenomenal! The profiteroles were extremely delicate and not overly sweet! The vanilla ice cream was very smooth and surprisingly the least sweetest thing on the plate. I'm not sure what the cream inside the profiterole is specifically, but I do know that it was extremely tasty. Along with the caramel and hazelnut nougatine, it tasted heavenly! Graham's 10 Years Tawny Port, which I sadly don't have a picture of, tasted really good, very rich in flavour and had a long-lasting finish. The wine was great on its own, but also tasted just as well with the profiteroles.  The lemon tart ended up being one of the best desserts I had ever tried in my life so far, and I would definitely go back to Laloux just to have this dessert! It was that good. What I liked the most about this dessert was their incredible creativity; I mean, have you ever had pepper in your sorbet? Or rosemary in your marshmallows? These ingredients completely blew my mind and I definitely had my WOW factor moment when I tried my dessert. Overall, I would definitely recommend this dessert, and I would probably come back to Restaurant Laloux for seconds, thirds, and fourths of this dessert! I hope they don't take it off the menu because I would definitely want to try it again with the dessert wine pairing!  By the time we were leaving, the restaurant was full of customers and it was very busy. Our trip to Restaurant Laloux was an enjoyable one, and we left with our minds preparing for our second visit. Personally, I would love to try their bar next time and experience their Menu Entr'acte, 2 appetizers and a dessert for $20! I just checked their menu, and the lemon tart is on their dessert selection."}
{"text":"Laloux will go down in infamy for being the absolute best meal we've had in a restaurant.  We came to Montreal for a few days to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Laloux was our \"splurge\" meal, although the prices are actually pretty reasonable compared to DC.  Especially when you see the quality of the ingredients, the presentation of the dishes, and the refined taste of each dish.    We started with the foi gras and sea urchin mousse.  Both were fantastic.  The foi gras was served with fresh honeycomb.  It was the best honey we've ever tasted!  For dinner I had the arctic char, and the mister had hanger steak.  Again both were so delicious.   The meal was absolutely amazing.  We loved Laloux!"}
{"text":"Open on a Sunday! This is how we found Laloux, and it was a lucky find.  Our meal was pretty perfect.    Beginning: The grilled calamari appetizer is phenomenal.   The shallot vinaigrette made the green salad memorable.  Middle: Pickerel fish- who knew?! So light and still tasty Lobster terrine that looks like a large sushi roll- why not?!  End: A very, very happy one.  Our shared desert was an elegant take on a chocolate delight: a brownie topped with mouse.  But, aside from the chocolate mouse that's rich (of course) but somehow not dense, paired with a very lightly sweetened creme, topped with toffee; the kitchen made the effort to divide the serving into one with the brownie and one without (for the gluten-challenged member of the pair).  Such thoughtful service!    I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant- any day of the week.  Not only will you enjoy a great meal, but you'll also venture to a neighborhood that's a bit off the beaten path.  Enjoy!  Side note: the chef's dedication to only serving sustainably caught fish is a testament to ethics and creativity.  The effort is really, really appreciated by this reviewer."}
{"text":"This was a classy french bistro that was delicious and highly recommended to us. It's an expensive meal, but worth it. Their vegetarian tartlet was good (not my favorite), but their appetizer with mozzarella and tomatoes was amazing! Their desserts were excellent too. Nice service and nice design of the restaurant. I would go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Laloux has Long been one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. It has, as other reviewers mentioned, changed hands several times over the course of the years, but through most of these changes it has remained an excellent French restaurant. My husband, son, and I chose to celebrate my milestone birthday (coyly I will not say which one) at Laloux last night.  Apparently there is a new chef, which we did not know.       Dinner was a big disappointment. For one thing, although we had called in advance to make sure there would be some vegetarian choices, there was just one choice among the mains on the menu and it was a pasta dish.  In the past Laloux has been creative in offering other vegetarian main dishes and we asked what other choices might be offered. The waiter suggested spinach risotto and I opted for that.  I'll return to the risotto shortly.        As an overall comment, the dishes were small. We are not big eaters, but we were surprised at the small portions in most of the dishes. My husband and son started with soup and it was not copious but it was OK. I started with a cauliflower appetizer and was looking forward to it because I had just eaten some delicious cauliflower a few days ago at a party. Better if the person who prepared the cauliflower for the party could have made my appetizer last night. The cauliflower was undercooked, and there were many hard oat crackers stuck around here and there on the plate.  I'll attach a photo of this dish.      Although there were bread plates on the table at each place, we were not given any bread, not even after the soup had been put on the table. We asked twice before bread was brought to the table. Amazingly, the bread was stale.        When the main dishes were served I actually thought that what was put in front of me must be a salad that the restaurant was offering since I had not ordered a salad. Upon closer inspection I realized that it was the spinach risotto. Unfortunately I did not take a picture of this. Essentially it was a small green boule in a bowl, and the portions in the main dishes that my son and husband had ordered were also small.  They actually ended up eating the stale bread because they were still hungry after the main dish and dessert.  As for the quality of my risotto, it was uninspired and uninspiring. It was very green but there's not much else one can say about it.       The dessert menu was also uninspiring, but all of us had plenty of room for dessert and each found something to order.  My son chose one that included chocolate ice cream, and it was the ice cream that he really wanted. When the desserts were served, his had no ice cream.   He pointed this out to the waiter, who said that the kitchen was out of chocolate ice cream.        I am very disappointed with Laloux after last night, and I doubt that I will ever go there again unless I hear that it is once again as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Our B&B inkeepers recommended Laloux to us and after some deliberation (and 30 minutes of walking aimlessly in the snow) we ended up coming here.  I am so happy we did!  Our meal was amazing!  To start, our waiter was great.  Very personable, we always had a full glass, yet he didn't feel intrusive.  I loved the part when he told us in the begin that \"We'll have a good time\".  Just set the tone for the evening.  Our meals were not dissapointing either.  I started with the beet salad which was incredible!  They were mixed with pomegranate seeds, pistachios, green beans and haloum cheese.  I would have never thought about mixing those flavors, but they all married so well.  My main delish was just as good!  I had the cod with hummus, olives, artichokes and lemon and it was bursting with flavor!  I can't say enough.  My husband ordered the parsnip soup and the gnocchi, both which he said were very pleasing as well.  It was such a nice, warm oasis in the cold, cold night!"}
{"text":"Very good dining experience in Montreal!! Getting here because of Yelp review, very good and no regret!!  The service is great and attentive. Foods are awesome and it is a very good dining experience in Montreal!!   Recommend to couple who is looking for romantic atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice meal, service, and decor.  It is my cousin's go-to place whenever she goes to Montreal.   Upon her recommendation, I went and definitely had a very nice experience.  I would go back again if I am every in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Highly recommend. I'll start by saying that the service was wonderful. Starting with the host, I asked as we got in where there was a pharmacy. seeing that we were out of town, he walked out in 0 degree weather and actually showed us where it was, and said he'd hold out table. The waitress as well was super knowledgeable and nice, patient with my millions of questions. Exceptional service.   The food was phenomenal. The dishes were innovative, and executed almost perfectly. The fois gras was sensational, the \"princess scallops\" were fantastic and beautiful, and the sea scallop entree was great. The only thing that wasn't quite up to total perfection was the steak tartare. It was excellent and creative, but for me, a bit too creative. I don't like when people add cream, and there was this bizarre extra crunchy thing thrown in...I just think there was too much going on. I prefer my steak tartare to be a bit simpler. Then we ended the meal with literally the best profiteroles I've ever had. - I think they blow torched se sugar on the top of the cream puffs to add that creme brûlée burnt caramel flavor and it was beautiful. Definitely go!  I would honestly give it a 4.75 stars (bc of the steak). So I rounded up."}
{"text":"We went to LaLoux on a Sunday night whim, since it was one of the few places that took OpenTable reservations -- the sorrows of traveling without a local phone.  It turned out to be one of the best decisions we made that weekend.    The restaurant is crisp, clean, and has little \"nooks\" for couples to dine in relative quiet and peace.  It isn't rowdy, and service is never pressured.  It's a great place for a date or to celebrate a special occasion.  We ordered the tasting menu for two (~$65 ea) without wine pairings (extra ~$20).  True to its European roots, our meal was a grand, three hour affair.  The \"amuse bouche\" was a fair-sized appetizer based off of fresh fruits.  There was a salad course, an appetizer (either quail or duck terrine), a main course of duck breast, a selection of cheese, and two desserts.    Since the selection will likely change, my overall impressions were that the cuisines were not traditional French, but played off very fresh, local food with intelligent connections between dishes.  For example, the appetizer and the main course tasted completely different, except for wild mushrooms that felt like they were placed to connect the experiences.  Excellent chef decisions all around.  I guess the finest compliment I can give is this -- we just came back from having the tasting menu at Le Bernardin last month, and we preferred our meal here."}
{"text":"I love the staff at Laloux, they are so friendly and helpful.  The food is really lovely, not large portions, but sophisticated and interesting.  It's a little gem that's been there a long time - rightly so."}
{"text":"Perhaps I ordered the wrong items because my experience was not in line with other reviewers. I got the beet salad and the duck. I didn't finish either dish, which is rare for me since these are two of my favorite items to eat. The beets were bland and somewhat bitter. Needed more of something (FLAVOR!). The items that accompanied the beets didn't add anything to the dish. The duck -  first, I didn't like the presentation. There was a lot going on and it looked amateur. Second, I hated the knife that they gave me. It was a steak knife and I had an awful time cutting the very thinly sliced meat (usually i'm served a plain edged knife with duck). Again, the duck itself wasn't flavorful. Would have loved more flavor seared on the top fat layer (there was some, but not enough to flavor the entire piece). It was served with squash, mushrooms, and onions. Suggestion - do away with the onions. Too many and too strong a flavor that overpowered the mushrooms and squash (which I liked and complimented the duck). I ordered wine (\"the most full bodied\") but the waitress didn't seem to know what I was talking about and kept mentioning tannins. I'm not a wine expert (which is why I rely on the staff) but what I was given was not full bodied (it was alright though - didn't bother me enough to ask for something else). I did, however, love the bread and butter :-) Also, the service was great."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal, came here and enjoyed one of the top 20 meals of my life.  A+ for interestingness of the tastes and platings, solid A for yum factor, A/A+ for a cordial and enthusiastic wait staff.  Hope I have some excuse to return to Montreal so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"We loved the food and the atmosphere at this Montreal eatery. Highlights of the meal included a compressed watermelon Asian-style salad, charcuterie with pickled veggies, a wonderful cold lobster dish, and the chocolate mousse for dessert. Very romantic, modern, and filled with light. Would highly recommend it for a special night out!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts (we finished all cuz the French taste is never heavy, and all ingredients just go well and balance each other). This place is indeed nice and all foods are so delicate and delicious. It's the second time I came in, the first time is 4 yrs ago when I traveled with fds to Canada. Although they have a small variety choice on menu, they do change it once a while. I wanted to order a duck based entree (cuz the pics on yelp looks good!) but they don't have it anymore. Will come back later probably! As my expectations is still rolling... :D"}
{"text":"Went for a romantic diner at Laloux.   The setting is simple and elegant. The service was good but not quite up to par for what I think Laloux is trying to achieve.  My diner partner had the beet entree and I had the shrimp verrine.  They were both very good and offered very creative flavour mixes. The verrine was however accompanied by Jerusalem artichoke chips that were oily and not that tasty.  I had the goat cheese raviolis with a mushroom sauce. It was very tasty but so rich it may be a better offering as an entree. The result was that I had trouble finishing my plate despite the portion being rather small.  My partner had the red wine braised beef. It was nothing exceptional as the flavours were rather plain. Again his portion was on the small side.  The dessert list is very nice and given I've followed the pastry chef's career on her blog for the last 4 years I was anxious to try her offerings. Hence we had 3  desserts for the two of us. One being the pot de crème (chocolate cream) which was very good. The other 2 desserts were elaborate compositions. One with an apple theme the other with citrus. All the components of these desserts were exquisite taken separately. Some of them however (like the ice creams) didn't mix well with the other parts of the desserts.  At the end of our meal the waitress brought us some mini sablés cookies to finish. Those just blew me away. They were the best cookies I ever had. I have to go on the pastry chef's blog (http://endlessbanquet.blogspot.com/) to pester her for the recipe :).  We enjoyed our evening but wouldn't choose Laloux again given the extensive choice of restaurants we have yet to try in this city."}
{"text":"This restaurant really lived up to the rave reviews.  Not one moment was a disappointment.   It's been a long time for us coming across a great find.  We had the caesar salad, charcuterie platter, arctic char, scallops and the cheese course in the end.  I could only speak of my dishes since i had no interest while devouring my meal and the bf felt the same.  The chicken was lightly battered and moist.  The scallops were seared and had a crisp to it and even the pureed cauliflower felt rich and creamy without feeling heavy.  As soon as we sat down, everything was perfect.  Our waiter was patient answering our questions and recommended a great bottle of wine (and less costly) that went well with our dishes.  Will def be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup d'atmosphere old school du restaurant, grands miroirs, discretion... Nourriture française traditionnelle et succulente"}
{"text":"This was the most sublime and delicious meal we had in Montreal. Conscientious and beautiful. The service was perfect, sommelier was helpful, the prices were so reasonable and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. I will tell my friends to come here because it is a truly pleasurable experience that you will remember.   I tried oysters, beet salad, beef tartar, charcuterie, profiteroles and wine pairings. I wish I could have tried more. They source local suppliers, and seek out sustainable foods and are supportive of local artisans.    Thanks to the brilliant staff for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Having a love for French food and having heard solid reviews, I entered Laloux confident that I'd be in for a treat.  Unfortunately, from start to finish, the meal simply did not deliver.  My date and I ordered the Potage St. Germain, a pea soup with bits of bacon, sweet onion and infused croutons.  Although the soup was tasty when the spoonful contained all the ingredients, the broth alone was a little too timid.  It did not carry any deep or complex flavours.  Furthermore, and what was most unfortunate about this soup was that it was just shy of being room temperature; it simply wasn't hot enough.  I had the impression that it must have been sitting around for too long before being sent out to our table.  As for the mains, I ordered the duck plate with ham and my date went for the steak.  The steak was wonderful, but the duck was so rare that it was inedible, since, even after a sip of wine, all I could taste was blood from the duck.  Luckily, my date thought it was \"okay\" it so we decided to switch plates (nice date!). The ham looked especially unappealing, and though I tried a bit of it and it was tasty, the presentation was a bit too \"real\" for me.  It looked like the pig's trotter was butchered and served fresh on my plate, so I left that portion untouched.  Finally, one of the two bok choy on my plate was burnt.  I was a little bit upset!  Enough said.  Dessert was by far better than the appetizer and mains.  We ordered the caramel profiteroles with ice cream.  While the profiteroles were excellent, the caramel sauce in which they were drenched was exceedingly sweet.  My partner and I tried our best to save the beautiful profiteroles from the sauce, but it was too late... perhaps a touch of sea salt would have salvaged the dessert, or at least the option of having the caramel on the side would have made the dessert more appealing.  Finally, the decor provides nice clean lines that I'm sure would satisfy architect Laloux, the namesake of this restaurant.  However, the minimalism of this restaurant kept my eyes craving that extra pop of color or texture, and the lighting was a little too bright for a romantic date night.  Nevertheless, the service was excellent and the waitstaff were attentive.    If you're looking for a nice French restaurant for a date night, I'd recommend going to Le Pegase over this place.  It is far more intimate and the food is far better.  It's also a bring-your-own wine restaurant and potentially better on the wallet (although I must say Laloux was very affordable! Our bill came out to 100$ excluding tip)."}
{"text":"We showed up about 45 min early before our reservation but Laloux was able to get us seated anyway (despite the fact that it did get much busier after we had arrived).  Service throughout the evening was excellent - my French is awful and even though it was clear that not all the staff were super fluent in English, they made every attempt to answer questions we had about the menu as best they could.  Food was excellent from both a presentation standpoint as well as the taste.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 decor 5/5 It's 5/5 Loved everything about it. Decor, service, and food! On top of that, When I checked in on Yelp I got an offer for a free pint of beer. Hey why not? I've put Laloux on my favourite list, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I tried their new bar and loved it! Excellent service, creative dishes, and very affordable!  I especially recommend the passion fruit dessert, which was amazingly creamy.."}
{"text":"Always on the never ending quest for an exemplary  dining experience as I travel the world and this evening I found yet another one at Laloux! After a brisk mile + stroll through some wonderful Montréal neighborhoods I found my destination.  Pleasant dinning room all the buzz for a Thursday evening as I arrived around sunset. Menu is very well presented with even a set experience which I passed on for a combination of dishes which I had high expectations for!!  Starting with the delectable Sunchoke soup and smoked salmon, marinated pearl onions, sunflower oil and seeds conditioned the pallets for what was to come.   Next the main coarse which was an beautifully presented Gaspésie arctic char complimented w whelks (sea snails), roasted tomatoe, fiddleheads, crustacean bisque, marinated sea lettuce and cucumber. The flavors caused my taste buds to be drenched in flavor hitting high notes with ever delicious bite!  After a smooth palette cleanse of an Old Fashioned à l'érable - Canadian Maple Whiskey, crab apple and ginger bitter topped w an orange wedge really prepared me for the last foray of the evening.   Gorgeous desert presentation... mid size Lemon Tart, dabbled w tiny crisp rosemary meringue kisses, sprinkled candied citrus puree, inviting grapefruit squares and sprinkled w pink peppercorn sorbet....WOW! Brilliant and C'est Magnifique!!    Needless to say I floated on the wonderful Montréal summer air as I strolled back to my hotel fully satisfied after a wonderful trip to an amazing city!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and wait help. Did not enjoy the food or wine much. We shared the pre fix sampler. Two appetizers an entree and desert with paired wine. We did not like any of the three wines. The appetizer was raw deer heart and foie gras. The heart was not much taste the foie grass was rich and very fatty. The duck breast was chewy."}
{"text":"Impeccable. Everything was remarkable. The food was awe inspiring and the service is among the best I've ever seen. Unpretentious atmosphere where we felt incredibly welcome and cared for. Would give 6/5 if I could.   The price is well worth the experience."}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday. Food was amazingly good, and atmosphere was very nice. The complimentary bread and butter kept on coming, though it was always cold and a bit hard. Service is very good, the waiters are polite and attentive. The price was relatively low for such a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place with a great, relaxed atmosphere. Perfect for a date or night out with friends. Not touristy or cheesey at all -- highly recommended for its fresh, high quality ingredients and execution. Wait staff was also incredible. I would go again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"One of the most adorable and cleverly hidden bistros in town. Portions are petite but intricately prepared. Great service and charming decor. Highly underrated."}
{"text":"Quel coup de coeur!   Avec la tonnes de restaurants à découvrir à Montréal, il est très rare que je retourne dans le même deux fois (même si j'ai bien aimé!), mais au Laloux, je n'ai pas pu m'en empêché!  Un service impeccable: pas trop présent, juste assez pour être guidé dans ses choix et ne manquer de rien. Quelques petites répliques par ci par là pour nous rendre le personnel des plus attachants! Et que dire du sommelier!? Lorsqu'il a vu que nous nous y connaissions un peu en vin et nous intéressions, il nous a fait gouter plusieurs produits et nous en a parlé.  La nourriture? Exceptionnelle? Autant pour les entrées et les plats que les desserts! Ce n'est pas n'importe qui qui peut entrer dans leur cuisine! Leur jambonneau de canard est à se rouler par terre et leur tarte au citron a certainement la plus belle présentation sur assiette qu'une tarte n'est jamais vue!   C'est un endroit parfait pour un souper romantique: beaucoup d'intimité, une ambiance calme, des lumières tamisées.  Honnêtement, je me retiens pour ne pas y aller tous les mois!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here on a Monday night. I've been all over Montreal and Los Angeles and this place is in my top 5. The service was impeccable. My girlfriend had food allergies and they completely catered to her needs. We had the tasting menu and though there were nuts in a half the dishes the chef made special plates for her. I highly recommend this restaurant. And don't fill up on the bread cause though it is amazing they will keep bringing it!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé sur l'heure du lunch, je suis arrivé après l'heure de point donc le service était plus relax.  Excellent repas avec un bon verre de vin!  Service irréprochable.  Aucune mauvaise surprise, le resto est èa la hauteur de mes attentes. J'y retournerai n'importe quand!"}
{"text":"Un excellent souper . De passage à Montréal pour voir un spectacle j'avais décidé de réserver chez Laloux. Tout était délicieux et quel service, Bravo !  Adresse conservée. A bientôt ."}
{"text":"Celebrated b-day there with a friend and was very happy I picked that restaurant. Place wasn't crowded on a weeknight,nice atmosphere. Everything was perfect. Flavours were delicate and extraordinary. Oysters, charcuterie plate, flank steak, profiteroles, all delicious! Service was friendly and knowledgeable,took time to help with wine selection and also explained the mysteriously awesome black garlic gravy.. Also received a small birthday present in the form of some special homemade sweets. Will come back and also give the more low-key bar a try soon..."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  My girlfriend and I stumbled upon Laloux after arriving late to our nearby hotel.  They kindly seated us just before closing.  Everything was delicious and exquisitely plated.  The sancerre we had was excellent.  Great food, great service, nice atmosphere.  Best meal we had in Montreal, among many.  One of the best dining experiences we've had in a while."}
{"text":"Extraordinary experience from start to finish. Started with fois Gras and recommended wine pairings. Entrees included flank steak, chard, sweetbreads and duck magret, and associated wine pairings. Everyone was delighted with the food and especially the service. The place wasn't very busy on a Wednesday night--hope everyone comes here and gives them plenty of business."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent.  My culinary language cannot adequately describe the dishes I ate tonight.  My friend and I had asparagus, with apple butter, smoked bread and parmesan.  She then had pan seared cod, with avocado and lemon grass, and I had beef filet with morel mushrooms and other wonderful stuff.  The presentation was beautiful.  The restaurant was very quiet.  I don't know why except that it's a sunday night, after a holiday).  You really must go.  A little pricey but worth every penny.  Samantha, our waiter was knowledgable and very personable.  We're from the US.  Tonight,  Laloux gave us yet another reason to come back to MTL"}
{"text":"Nouveaux chefs, très bonne bouffe, venez essayer ! L'assiette est super bien mise. Le service est très bien aussi."}
{"text":"This is one of those meals that is completely unforgettable. Everything went perfectly from start to finish -- that is, besides the blizzard going on outside. I'm not sure what we were thinking when we decided to roadtrip to Montreal in the middle of the winter holidays.  We actually arrived 45 minutes early to our reservation time, but we were so numb from killing time in the cold (and mostly everything was closed) that we figured we could at least wait inside the restaurant until our time. To our pleasant surprise, they eagerly sat us at our table immediately upon arrival!  I'm not sure if you could possibly order the wrong dish here. Not only did everything sound divine on the menu, Jonathan Lapierre-Rehayem and his staff executed everything perfectly. The quail (cooked just right, loved the labrador tea syrup), the pasta (great sauce), scallops (solid portion, cooked well), steak (perfect char), and cod (melted in mouth, but wasn't a fan of the sweet potato puree) were all lovely, but you absolutely must order the foie gras. They even brought out a rack of beeswax for you to dollop some honey right into the dish, which also included fresh fruit and almonds. Believe me, once you try that fresh honey with your foie gras, you can't go back. (Sorry, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, your foie gras was first in my heart... until I came here.)  To top it off, we treated ourselves to to-die-for (literally) pastries by Stéphanie Labelle of Rhubarbe. We ordered the pear dessert and lemon tart, some of the best desserts I've ever had. In the pear dessert, besides the stale buckwheat cake on the side, the pear sorbet stole the show - it was the perfect combination of ice and fruit and not too sweet. The lemon tart was SO good we wanted to order another, but then we would probably have to roll out of the restaurant.  Next time I'm in town, which appears to be very soon, I will definitely make a stop here! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderful service. Superb wine pairings.  Well priced. My favourite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Lalaoux is an incredible if well known stop on the culinary tour of Montreal.  Traditional French everything.  Excellent food, elegant service, intimate space, and a very real and valuable sommelier all make a truly sensual dining experience."}
{"text":"Everyone raved about the food here, but for me it was just OK. Maybe I'm jaded from all the French cooking I've eaten over the years but it was just.. standard, Parisian bistro fare to me.  It's basic French fare, made fancier.  (Don't get me wrong, I STILL loved the restaurant and liked the food, but to put this on the same level as French gastronomy is stretching it for me.)  I'd come here for a nice lunch with a friend, and would recommend it as a date spot, but I can't say like all the other Yelpers it was the best food I ever had, because it isn't. :(  The best French food I've ever had was in Paris with a chef who personally cooked for me, and his food blew this stuff out of the water. We're talking real homemade foie gras perfectly paired with fig jam, not foie gras terrines for instance.  Or the other great bistro fare I've had was in Lyons but it was definitely what I'd call \"really good food\" and it blew THIS place out of the water too, and that's just a regular hole in a wall in Lyons that's a true French bistro.  Anyway, the food was OK. I'm a fan because I'll come back and eat here because it's decent, but for the price and what I got, I cannot say it is amazing French food.  I ate the beef tartare which was delicious but a little too tart for my liking (that black garlic sauce was gooooood though), and the dessert was the lemon tart which I found OK, but not amazing, Pusateri's in Toronto makes a killer lemon and coconut tart that is way better.  The service though, wow 5 stars for sure. Great waiters, great ambience, wonderful all around. They're all stars there, I'm just a snob and there's nothing more you can say about that."}
{"text":"Superbe bistro, local magnifique bien éclairé, (par l'architecte Pierre Laporte).  À essayer pour le lunch menu élaboré, ingrédients frais, locaux et de qualité. Bel équilibre dans tous les plats.  On est surpris et on y retourne.   Merci au chef Jonathan lapierre Rehayem.  Et à l'excellent serveur Patrick."}
{"text":"excellent service, presentation and food. 20-30$ for mains, 6-10$ for starters. meal was worth every penny. agreed: staff are attentive and easy going."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I chose to eat at Laloux with a big group and the food was spectacular. The waiters were very kind and took our jackets when we first arrived at the restaurant. They were not pushy and gave us ample time to order. Our bread bowl was always refilled. The food was great! I got the beef and it was delicious. The balsamic vinegarette was to die for. The beef could have been more tender. I also tried the liver mousse and it was a lot more appetizing than it looked. The portions were a bit too small for my liking, but everything was very good."}
{"text":"Solid! I came here recently for dinner with a friend. This was probably the priciest meal we had on our trip, yet the place felt inviting and had a great ambiance. I ordered the scallops with cauliflower and parsnips -- delicious! The flavors worked well together and the scallops were perfectly cooked. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for something slightly more upscale, but still with a chill vibe.  -L."}
{"text":"I think this is a great little restaurant.  The whole experience starting from the design, service and menu was outstanding. The decor was simple, modern and classy without being overbearing.  The atmosphere was sophisticated with a smart casual vibe.  My kind of spot.  In terms of food, the scallops, artic char, beet salad, butternut squash soup and deconstructed lemon tart were delicious.  When reading through the modern french menu, you almost think that there are too many things going on in each dish; however, they come together wonderfully.  I will say that you may need 3 courses to fill up though because portions aren't huge but they are adequate.  I'm going to give this place a solid 4 stars (border line 5) because the quality to price ratio is right up there.  The total bill for two (one glass of wine each, 2 mains, 2 apps and 1 dessert) was around $110.    If I lived in Montreal, I think I would be a regular here.  With that being said, I look forward to coming back to Laloux to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"The menu is fantastic, the waiters attentive, the food exceptional... But the wait! It took 3 hours and a half for a dinner, and we had a reservation. The first course arrived one hour after we were seated, and the restaurant was not even half full. Sorry, not going again just for this reason. I can understand taking your time, but that's pushing it."}
{"text":"Extra special.  That is what comes to mind when I think of my recent dining experience at Laloux.  While my supper was outstanding (I had the duck magret), Laloux stood out as a little gem for how they accommodated my vegan husband.  Normally when we dine out if a restaurant is able to offer him a meal they take what's on the menu, usually a pasta dish, and eliminate all animal products; the altered version is usually just ok.  Not only did Chef Jonathan Lapierre-Rehayem create a gourmet meal off the menu of vegetables and grains that showed the Chef's great skill of melding and complementing flavors and textures, Pastry Chef Gabriel Lavoie (also a vegan) created a special chocolate dessert for my husband that tasted virtually identical to my nonvegan version of the same decadent and delicious dessert.   My husband and I were both blown away by the level of skill and attention to detail shown by these two talented Chefs, as well as how much the Chefs, our server, and the hostess wanted to make him happy.   In addition to the exceptional food, the staff was welcoming and helpful, service of each course was timed just right, and the room was lovely.  I love that Laloux prides itself on using local and seasonal ingredients, either organic or by sustainable means.  For our next trip to Montreal, Laloux will be the first restaurant I call for a reservation!"}
{"text":"Parisian inspired bistro, romantic and great for small groups. Been here a couple of times and although the chefs have changed a couple of times, the food is consistently good, fresh, sustainable."}
{"text":"Not making a reservation well in advance makes lucking into an extraordinarily good dining experience all the more special. It happened for our party of 4 when we struck out at three places after delaying our attempt at a reservation on a Saturday night and ended up in a place we all emerged convinced gave us a dining experience as good or better than any of the ones we could not get a table at could have provided. The menu is brief but brilliant. Each dish was wonderously prepared and presented. The staff was attentive and had a command and confidence  about the food and beverages they served. We had Arctic Char, duck, beef and scallops. Each entre was outstanding and was complimented with perfectly seasoned and perpared an accompanied by just the right vegetable and starch.  The wine selection was quite good and the somelier guided us expertly in choosing  surprisingly good, relatively inexpensive wine to go along with what we ordered. In a city with a multitude of fine restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find one more rewarding than Laloux!"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner menu and not lunch.    Service and Ambiance:    * Nice friendly service    * I decided to venture with coworkers away from Old Montreal to Plateau Mont-Royal area to try the dishes from Laloux.  I like the warm bistro-feel of the restaurant with white tablecloth draped tables and lots of natural light.  It was charming and elegant.  Food:    * They have real raw honey - which earned an extra star from me!  Raw honey is totally unprocessed honey. It still contains pollen, propolis, honeycomb and live enzymes -- all the goodness the bees put in!  Why am I raving about honey you ask?  Well, grasshopper, honey not only tastes good, its properties are good for you. Honey is magic. Besides its delicious taste, it's pretty much the only food that does not spoil while in an edible state.     * Among our party, we had practically all the appetizer and dinner dishes.  The charcuterie platter with pickled vegetables is a great dish to share, with all the staple meats.    *  I had the veal sweetbreads, creamy polenta, Québec fiddlehead and cherry tomato, morel and Vin Jaune sauce.  A popular Western EU dish, this is my first experience with veal sweetbreads.  I did not realized that veal sweetbreads are the thymus gland or pancreas of a calf. The term \"sweetbread\" is quite misleading (to me), but the dish was well prepared and good.  After several Montreal restaurants, I am not fond of the fiddleheads (see picture) both for the taste and insect-like appearance.  Drinks:    * Great selection of wine, single malts and good cocktails.    Price and Value:    * Well...value is subjective. For the money and in comparison with other similar French restaurants within a 10 mile radius, I would rate this restaurant as good value.  There are hits and misses since myself and friends didn't like everything we ate.  But, for the service and food, I came prepared to spend the money to dine here...and the raw honey was an unexpected nice treat!"}
{"text":"Some restaurants make you feel bad about the decision of coming to them , this is one of them.   From the non smile unfriendly hostess, to the \"blown away \"( not in a good way) meal, we've had it all.   We went there for the MTL à la table évent, we've been several restaurants for the past two years before, and all of them were awesome experiences! Then we decided to give this place a try , unfortunately we regretted it so so so much!   Skip the \"little finger\"( literally, tomato salad was just 3 tiny pieces of tomato) portion appetizer, let's talk about the mains. Mine was the cod fish, which tastes like a over-cooked chicken breast, the texture of this delicate fish was totally ruined by the unhappy chef ( I assumed, otherwise I had no idea how a chef could handle cod fish so horribly). And the beef dish my friend had was ....I don't even know where to start it, from the portion( there we go, this time was thumb size, a little bit bigger, eh) to the taste , it was literally a piece of sadness! She couldn't even cut the meat apart by using the knife, imagine how stiff the beef was!   And the worst part was my \"hard as a rock\" dessert, it was this tiny little ugly looking  cake ( or cookie?) which felt  like sitting in a shelf for 3 days ! And the taste? Sweet sweet and hard!   I feel like I just threw my $50 bucks to the water, I got confused why this place been raked as 4.5 stars, I'll let the pictures tell the truth, I'm gonna go grab my homemade sandwich and call it the night!"}
{"text":"Truly memorable. We had the Valentine's Day menu (offering for the whole weekend). I wasn't sure about some of the courses and was a bit surprised they didn't offer the main menu, but I stretched my palate and found there was nothing to worry about- everything was cleanly presented and full of complex flavors.   It was five courses for $65- starting with an amuse bouche of a single oyster, with mango (?) and salt- simple and lovely and got our taste buds ready for more.   2nd course-  snow crab with apples topped with a thick sour cream foam- HEAVEN. It was accompanied by tiny potato chips- charming. Hubby had the lamb tartar- now, I don't like lamb in general, but I took a bite, and had to completely change my feelings- it was luscious and divine. If I didn't absolutely love my snow crab, I would have devoured his!   3rd course- I had this amazing bacon wrapped scallop with a foam (sorry- I can't remember what it was!) with celery delicately strewn about the plate. Hubby had a miss, unfortunately- it was a game meat soup (?) with attractive curly pastas encased in a puff pastry. The flavors were very mild, but the soup was thin and had no actual game in it. The pastry was flaky, but when disassembled, would fall into the soup and make it soggy. :( 4th course- we shared the lobster risotto which was made with the knuckles and surrounded by the tail and claws. Beautiful presentation- and it came with assorted colored carrots that were simply prepared, yet full of flavor- French country cooking at its best.  5th course- by this time, I was stuffed! I had the fruit salad, which was a very original interpretation of your grandma's fruit salad. Cut into tiny pieces and topped with a frozen (I want to say) mango, but I can't be sure- maybe passion fruit? It slowly melted as you ate it and it was lovely. Also had a couple of very small broken meringue cookies interspersed throughout. Hubby had the chocolate cake with what I think was a raspberry sorbet. It also had a small dollop of a light white sauce, but honestly, I took a only small bite because I was going to explode. In a good way, of course!  Entire meal took about 2 1/2 hours- this was both a good and bad thing for us. I know, I'm a stupid American (I own up to it), but felt hungry throughout until the lobster (and then 2 bites and I was suddenly stuffed!) and was always trying not to eat all the bread between courses. My American style way of eating out expects to have one course after another which, when you think about it, is pretty gross. It was nice in a way to have the advantage of lingering, but I fear I ate, not quickly, but certainly not at a snail's pace. I blame my frustration on the slow service solely on me. Sit! Relax! Smoke a ciggy in between courses! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS PLACE. As far as a meal goes, it is hard to get any better!   I got their 5 course sampler for ~80ish with wine pairing. The value out weight the cost. And for ten dollars extra, you can upgrade one of the appetizers to the foie gras. Totally worth it. The best foie gras i had. and the sparking rose wine that was paired with that was amazing! Close to one of the best meal i ever had. The five course meal ended up being 7/8 when they send out pre-appetizer, and two extra desert. We got three deserts...   Amazing service as well. We got there late. 10PM when their kitchen closes at 10:30PM and we stayed until 11:45PM. We were the last customers there and not once did they hurry us.   This is the best where everything is right. The service, food, atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"The food, brilliant! The service, Flawless! Simón, knowledgable, professional and friendly! Our experience here savoring the tasting menu was simply perfect! I cannot over emphasize that this was our singularly BEST restaurant meal in the last four years of visiting this incredible foodie city! I wish I could give more stars!"}
{"text":"I went there for 'Taste MTL' week. Of the available menu, I had the seared trout, the beef tartar, and the profiteroles. I wish there had been more of the seared trout, as it was DELICIOUS. The beef tartar was quite good, but it included beets, which was a bit of a downer for me. And of course, the dessert was magical! Great wine selection, and the waitress was really friendly and extremely patient with my friend who tasted about 4 different wines before he finally settled."}
{"text":"Was not sure what to expect as French cuisine is typically limited in terms of vegetarian options. But had an absolutely delicious and spot-on pasta, with brocoli, melted cheese, chanterelles, lemon- absolute flavour perfection! Would highly recommend. The dessert was to die for- had the lemon tart with marshmallow, thyme topping. The service was also impeccable. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"treat yourself to the aged prime rib...and talk to the charming, nice sommelier. one of the best meals we've had, lovely ambiance and service with a friendly no-attitude attitude."}
{"text":"Laloux was a delicious meal to conclude our trip to Montreal.  First thing to note: there is a dining room side (right) and a bar side (left) to the restaurant.  This distinction is important, because it will change the formality of your experience.  We sat at the bar, which I believe limited our menu options - though I saw others ordering from a broader menu.  However, we were not at all displeased.  For $20, each person was able to get two savory plates and a dessert.  The food was amazing.  I started with a beet salad, then beef tartare and finally lemon tart.  The smoked trout was a surprising and delicious dish.    Service was fantastic.  The bartender (and perhaps their sommelier) was very helpful with our wine choices.  And every member of the waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  You could tell they were all working hard and yet still maintained such great attitudes.  You can tell this is a place the locals of Montreal like to visit, and it would certainly be one of my go-to's if I had the pleasure of living nearby.  Do visit Laloux."}
{"text":"the potential was there, good looking food, anemic portions. but cold entrees, and cold service overshadowed the whole experience, at preposterous prices...hope this is productive feedback. - a disappointed diner who was rushed out from his table."}
{"text":"Really beautiful food, great taste and exceptional service. Very pleasant experience during our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Incredible meal Cucumber soup Charcuterie was the best I've had and the profiteroles were phenomenal"}
{"text":"My partner and I went here on Saturday night based on the Yelp reviews.  We were somewhat disappointed.    While nothing was horrible, it was certainly not outstanding.  We had escargot for an appetizer.  It was just okay.  Maybe it was a bit chewier than others I had.    For the main course I had the Duck Confit.  It was decent, but nothing exciting.  Potatoes were alright.  My partner had the Filet Mignon,.  It was cooked to his liking, but it was a bit tough.  It should cut like butte, but it was a bit hard to cut.  I would maybe consider coming back, but my partner would definately not want to go back to this one."}
{"text":"Bouffe de qualité, vraiment digne d'un grand resto Malheureusement, la fois où j'y suis allé (pendant Montréal à table), une grande table de jeunes avait réservé et il faisait beaucoup de bruit, à en déranger tout le resto... A part ça, le service était irréprochable, la bouffe excellente, les desserts aussi font fooous!!! :) Le décor est entre bistro simple et resto chic, sans trop de froufrou Laloux est bien situé aussi, pas trop loin du métro Sherbrooke A essayer plus d'une fois, pour pouvoir tester plusieurs trucs qui ont l'air trop bons!!!"}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu with the wine pairing, while it was a pricey dinner, it was more than worth it. The whole experience was wonderful and and the 5 courses were delicious.  A very nice dinner."}
{"text":"(This review is for their \"Montreal à Table\" prix fixe menus).  The quick low-down: welcoming, friendly staff;  subdued, old-school Paris bistro lighting, hit-or-miss dishes.  The set menu included choices of: - scallop sashimi or marinated trout - wine poached egg with beet, bacon, grape salad or beef tartare - chocolate cake & frothed caramel \"earthquake\" with coffee ice cream or caramel profiteroles with vanilla ice cream  Though not overly remarkable visually, all the dishes were well presented.  Unfortunately the scallops weren't well cleaned before plating and contained bits of sand/shell which provided an enamel-grinding crunch.  Overall the plainness of the undressed scallops could've used a little boost of fleur de sel & pepper at the least.  The wine-poached egg with salad was a curious dish.  The egg, besides its color, wasn't remarkable.  It didn't take on a particularly interesting flavor from its bath in vinho tinto, but the salad nest around it was quite good in all respects.  The seared beef tartare on the other hand, was pretty damn spiffy.  The searing added a steak-like flavor to what I normally find a pretty plain-jane raw beef, texture-focused dish.  Marinated mushrooms tossed into the mix bumped up the umami quotient to tastebud teasing levels and the dense, crunchy crouton-like bits tossed in provided a texture contrast to the normal meat-mush-a-thon.  The desserts were both good. The chocolate cake / frothed, caramel brittle looked like an 8.8 on the Richter scale of dulce-de-cocoa upheaval (check out the photos).  Profiterole cream burgers, with a heavy drizzle of bittersweet caramel rounded out the browned sugar one-two punch.  The noise level is on the high-end at full swing.  For a quiet conversation, I'd recommend Birks Café, with its open mezzanine/sound-escape setup.  The sandy scallop affair was likely a one-off issue and the red-wine egg bath was likely created for the MTL-à-Table menu, so overall this a 3.5 star rating.  Even with the missteps mentioned above, Laloux's still worth a try if you're looking for more classic-style French bistro fare."}
{"text":"You will be hard pressed to find a finer looking bistro in Montreal than the luminous Laloux, just a couple blocks off busy Rue Saint Denis.  Seth Gabrielse is dedicated to local seasonal products and the menu hews close to dishes from the region.   Start with a field-fresh green salad or the generous (and rich) plate of charcuteries made in-house.   Main dishes include a perfectly seared duck breast on creamy polenta, the sweet duck meat balanced by a rhubarb sauce.    The wine list is extensive and expertly put together, the prices fair.  There is also a small selection of artisanal beers (the Rosée d'hibiscus made by the local brewery Dieu du Ciel makes for a great aperitive) and ciders (we loved the  Cidre pétillant rosé by Michel Jodoin with our olive oil cake dessert.  Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, spotless restaurant. A great place for a family dinner. Service was very attentive and professional."}
{"text":"It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to dine at Laloux for Mtl a Table! I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while, and this was a great opportunity to do so while keeping the price a bit more reasonable.   The dining room was very nice - black and white colouring, soft lighting, lots of windows and mirrors. It is a very nice atmosphere to enjoy quality food.  The many components of each dish complimented each other perfectly. The beet appetizer included an excellent cold goat cheese that, when mixed with honey, made for a creamy, somewhat sweet dish. The cod dish was excellent. Fish was cooked perfectly, and the carrot-based sauce had a mild curry flavour.  Dessert may have been my favourite course. The creaminess of the white chocolate with the intense fruit and tart flavour of the raspberry granita was perfect. I highly suggest saving room for dessert!  On that note, a warning that the portions are quite small, so you may not have to intentionally save room :) Also, prices for wine start pretty high so, despite saving with the Mtl a Table, it still turned out to be an expensive meal. But it's worth it once in a while!"}
{"text":"Half of the food that was listed online wasn't available at the restaurant. The mushroom appetizer was lovely, the trout, however, was near tasteless. I also continued with a lamb main dish which was great. My friend on the other hand had the 'pasta' which genuinely tasted just like buttery carrots. The service was good but I don't think it made up for the food. Presentation was good but not ok if the taste was bad"}
{"text":"Always a consistent fine dining experience. Top-notch service, they are all pros. The food is incredibly creative. The menu changes seasonally, but some winning dishes stay on. The plates come out beautifully set. It's great for every occasion, weather you are trying to impress a guest, celebrate an occasion with loved ones,  or an elegant romantic date. I wish the prices were more affordable - I usually come here when someone else is picking up the check. I recently discovered the  Menu Entracte - $20 for two appetisers and a dessert. That could be interesting to try! Dishes are not very large, but most are suitable for sharing."}
{"text":"Nice simple French bistro.  Good service.  Good location though it is a bit away from the main streets.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food, prepared with care, attention and to perfection.  Every bite was an explosian of flavours.  Friends, knowledgeable waiters (on the food and wine) and a wonderful atmosphere.  Definately worth the price and experience."}
{"text":"A couple surprises at this place.  I came here for MTL à Table not expecting much cause I didn't pick the place.  I entered the door and the first thing they did after checking our reservation was take our jackets.  ~Fancy fancy!~ Maybe I haven't been to enough fancy restaurants but this was the first time I had a service like this. A check off my bucket list! (Now time to find a restaurant where they would start playing the violin).  MTL à Table is Montréal's Restaurant Week where you can try out three course menus from participating restaurants and leave without weeping wallets. Laloux had two choices for each course. Naturally, it becomes a competition on who will pick the better dish.   I picked roasted beets with wild grape gel and smoked pecans as my entrée, mostly because \"chicken liver mousse\" sounds a bit too avant garde for me. Well, should've been more adventurous because the internal organs of a chicken is actually pas mal. That hazelnut crumble was probably the thing that did the trick. My beets salad was light and refreshing, but a bit lack lustre compared to the chicken liver, especially when they busted out that panel of honeycomb, surprise surprise!! First course: 0 - 1.   For our main course, there was a choice between the duck leg and Arctic char filet. I was too lazy to hack meat off of a duck leg so I went with the Arctic char filet. Wrong choice again! I wasn't too into the arctic filet and the roasted celeriac was a bit too sour for my taste. The duck leg was packed with flavour though. Get the duck leg and tell your friends to get the meat off for you if you're too lazy like me. Second course: 0 - 2.  Finally dessert! Time to bust out my second stomach. I got the praline cake with pear sorbet. I tried the chocolate jar and although quite tasty, I felt it lacked the texture the praline cake provided. Finally a win for me. FInal score: 1 - 2.   tl;dr - Fancy atmosphere, great for dates, creative dishes, don't be lazy, be adventurous if you want to pick the better dish."}
{"text":"Laloux has probably the most aesthetically pleasing and profoundly ethereal desserts I've ever seen. Go there just for the desserts if you're not bashful haha. Entree wise, I had the duck magret and it was not very appetizing at all. Very slimy in texture and bitter in taste. The filet was a little better, but overall, it is nothing special and there are much, much better more palatable, sensational and exquisite dining out there. Service is very laughable and the waiter ripped us off when converting money. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Best steak ever. Lovely bottle of wine (under $50) and fantastic service. Overall, great romantic date place."}
{"text":"Great food, not cheap mind you, but definitely fantastic value for high quality French food and generous portions. Nice ambience - feels like you've been transported to Paris. Stayed for a long dinner, and service was not rushed at all. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Inattentive and slow service but delicious well balanced food.   Just want to warn you that you might be walking into a 3 hour meal with spotty bread service, long waits between courses and lack of water refills.  Definitely all of my pet peeves at a restaurant.   This could have been a 4 star experience but the service knocked off 2 stars."}
{"text":"Topissime !!! Des goûts recherchés, originaux, une belle réussite ! Je me rappelle particulièrement de la mousse d'oursins... un véritable régal !"}
{"text":"The food here is good and I like the decor but they over-season everything. For example, my chicken liver mousse had apple slices and a spoonful of honeycomb and some sweet purplish sauce around it; when I took a bite of the liver without any of the accompaniments it already tasted sweet and nothing like liver. If I wanted a cup of cream and sugar, I wouldn't have ordered coffee!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful off the beaten path French Bistro. It has been in this residential neighborhood for 39 years--essentially unchanged. It is filled with light (during lunch) and has a warm glow (during dinner). The chef has a light touch with the food. The wine list is both well selected and well priced. In fact, the food is far more reasonably priced than in centre-city restaurants. This is a must stop in Montreal. The menu changes daily, so I won't go on about what to order. Whatever you do choose, I'm sure you'll savor it."}
{"text":"Beautifully appointed restaurant in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Very unassuming from the outside but once you step in it was nicely lit, minimally but the decor tastefully done, warm and inviting.  The food was outstanding and inventive.  Their Foie gras terraine was out of this world.  Our server set down each order and then brought out a huge slab of fresh hoeycomb and dramatically served each order a nice portion of the delicious honey. great balance of savory and sweet.  The grilled beef tartare was  another dish that was perfectly executed.  The yolk giving the overall dish a nice balanced richness too.  The homemade charcruterie platter was equally delicious as well as pleasing to the eyes.    For our mains we ordered: Gaspesie arctic char filet: cauliflower puree, salt roasted celeriac, sea lettuce, sunflower seeds and oil; Duck magret: squash puree, roasted red kuri squash, mushrooms, morel sauce and immature juniper berries; Scallops: sunchoke, chinese artichoke, parsley roots, romanesco cabbage and preserved lemon; Bee wax poached veal sweetbreads: roasted onions, girolles, beets, raw honey gel and pollen. Sweetbreads poached in beeswax, the delicate flavor of the sweetbread was not hindered by over cooking in one bit. The Duck Marget was outstanding and the the artic char was fresh in taste and accompanied well with the celeriac and cauliflower.  The scallops were cooked to a medium rare and it was the ideal cooking temp to have them done in.  Service was exceptional and the noise in the room not so loud that we could have a decent conversation without shouting at one another. No room for dessert so gives me another reason to come back for another visit soon!"}
{"text":"Cuisine Excellente! Riz de veau au top, le tartare de buf réinventé, il n'y a pas un plat ordinaire. La cuisine française subtile est ici. Et les desserts... Profiteroles, mon must la gâteau de chèvre, sublime. Sans oublier 2 canelets avec l'addition, qui reste raisonnable. A refaire!"}
{"text":"The food was quite good, although at the price you're paying, it should be better. The bigger problem was that both my partner and I suffered horrible abdominal pains after the meal, destroying an otherwise romantic evening. I think the culprit was likely undercooked Jerusalem artichokes.   When I wrote to the owners to complain, they offered a belated, muted apology. It seems to me that if I drop $300 on a meal and then get violent stomach pains because of the food, the least they could do would be to offer a bottle of wine? A dessert?   Anyway, I certainly don't recommend the establishment. If you choose to go, avoid the topinambours!"}
{"text":"As exceptional a meal as you'll have.  I had three starters:  beet salad, beef tartare, and the foie gras.   All were unbelievably creative and exceptionally tasty.  Ambience is great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice table cloth setting. We came on a Sunday evening, the waiter speaks English. We ordered a glass of wine and a maple old fashioned to start. A point taken off the  maple old fashioned because they used fast melting crushed ice instead of cocktail ice or even regular ice. They did use a generous amount of whiskey in the cocktail. The butter that came with the table bread was frozen and not spreadable. The foie gras was pretty good; it came on toasted bread and tasted like duck liver. I ordered the Arctic Char which came with sea snails and chopped asparagus as a garnish - it tasted good, but at 27 CAD, a bit excessive if only due to the presentation (sea snails seems a little gimmicky as the 3 pieces of snail didn't really add to the dish). The lady ordered the duck with roasted beets - \"The beets are good\" from what she said, but the duck was a little tough, chewy, not flavorful and mediocre overall; the caramelized onion that came with the duck was not sufficiently caramelized. The host directed me to use the lady's bathroom when the men's room was occupied and gave me plenty of reassurances that it'll be ok, so plus 1 on the flexibility. Food - 3.5 out of 5, atmosphere 5, cocktail 3."}
{"text":"Restaurant Laloux was absolutely wonderful. My fiancée and I came here during a day trip to Montreal and we splurged on the 5 course sampler with wine pairings for her birthday, which actually turned out to be more like an 8 course sampler with the amuse-bouches and a cheese course. It's probably more than I've ever spent on a meal, but it was one of the best meals of my life. I'm sure if I thought hard enough about it I could place it in the top 3 for sure. We ate there 3 nights ago and I still remember pretty much everything we had, it made that good of an impression:  First amuse-bouche - scallop with a citrusy marmalade: very good, cool, citrusy and sweet First appetizer - lightly seared arctic char with fennel and creme fraiche on fish broth: also very good, savory without being heavy and rich. A nice sweet cool white wine was paired with it and was excellent Second appetizer - homemade tagliatelle with beef cheek, chinese artichokes and some kind of cured meat: this was amazing, and could have been a main course in and of itself. My fiancée's favorite course of the night, so rich and flavorful. This was paired with...I believe a greek red wine that was very thin on the tongue. This is when we really started getting transported by this meal :) Main course - Venison over mashed parsnips with baby asparagus and pearl onion: this was unbelievably good, I got chills when eating it. I'd never had venison this good. This was paired with another red wine which I thought matched it very well but I don't recall much about that one. I do recall thinking that the wine pairings were excellent, they were very good wines that were quite unique and accented the dishes so very well. Cheese - The waitress came up and asked us after the main course if we'd like to have some cheese (an additional $4 for 25g of each), and we had two that were excellent, a soft cow's milk cheese and a very smooth and tangy bleu Second amuse-bouche - small panna cotta with homemade jelly: very sweet, soft and delicious Dessert - I had a lemon jelly with pound cake and my fiancée had a peanut sauce with a sort of chocolate bark: mine was quite good, sour and sweet, but the peanut dish was a little too salty (the only misstep of the night, and by then we were so full that it hardly mattered) And finally - they brought us a few homemade candies that were quite good as well.  Total cost: $85 each for dinner and wine, $8 extra for the cheese, tax and tip = $230. Yikes. But like I said, it was absolutely worth it for a special dinner that was one of the best meals of my life."}
{"text":"One of the best French restaurants in Montreal. We are so satisfied all the meal, great service, friendly stuffs, and confortable stay. We will definitely come back here, thanks"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner for my wife's birthday while we were visiting Montreal. The beef tartar and the lemon tart were especially delicious. Although partially due to the current exchange rate, I found it to be a solid value overall as well."}
{"text":"Vraiment très déçu ! Venue pour Montréal à Table et vacciné pour revenir de sur. Je n'avais pas d'attente particulière et bien heureusement car sinon je serais tombé de très haut ! Aucune saveur dans nos plats, le serveur/manager ne parle pas un mot, la serveuse ne nous explique rien dans ce qu'elle sert. C'est servi illico presto, à peine commandé on est servis donc à peine eu le temps d'aller au toilette. On ne nous demande même pas si on veut boire un truc avec le repas. Service très médiocre pour ce qui est un restaurant à priori réputé. Pour un menu à 41$, ce qui est le haut de gamme de MTL à table, je trouve cela très très light. Cela ne vaut pas plus que 21$, j'ai fait plusieurs 31$ et il y a un monde d'écart par rapport à cette expérience .... Payer 106$ au final pour cela c'est un rapport qualité-expérience-prix misérable. Couplé à cela que les locaux sont vraiment pas accueillant, je n'avais pas envie de rester dedans plus longtemps ... Aucun doute que Laloux et moi ce fut bref et éphémère ..."}
{"text":"I saw the high review on yelp, but the reality was very disappointed  I booked the reservation at 7pm, in fact the reservation was unnecessary, only few customers are there beside us.  They don't have straw to use for cocktails...Why? The waitress wanted all of us to take the course menu (because is more expensive), but we decided to take only one course to share and few other à la carte. We made a right decision. None of dishes surprised us.  Wasn't enjoyable at all"}
{"text":"Walking along the streets of Montreal, I tell my brother that I want some nice quality French food. I'm dressed in my tourist gear, and he's dressed  in his casual work attire... so we can't go into anywhere that is going to require someone to be ultra fancy. We're about to walk by Laloux when I say \"what about this place?\" -- their outside terrace drew me right in.  We speak with the hostess and since we do not have a reservation, we would only be able to sit outside, as that was all they had available at the moment... which is perfect because that's what we wanted anyway!  We were definitely underdressed for this establishment, but what I liked very much and respected, was that they did not treat us any differently because we were dressed casual. I've received improper treatment due to dress before, so kudos to Laloux.  I started with the salad - very good, with veggies that were slightly cooked but still firm and not overdone/soft. There were mushrooms, radishes, asparagus, onions, and a few other greens in the vinaigrette. I will say that I was a bit nervous when this arrived as the contents of the salad. I'm not a big fan of radishes, asparagus, or mushrooms.... but it was delicious and I ate it all.  The bread and butter was plentiful. My brother and I are not shy of carbs, so I think we went through 2.5 baskets of it, and had we wanted to continue eating it, they would have continued bringing out out. Fresh, warm bread with salted butter.  The main course that I chose was the duck in a dandelion honey glaze, served with fork mashed potatoes with berber spices, collard greens, and long pepper sauce. It was delicious beyond my expectations. I don't order duck very often... when given the chance I'd normally order some kind of steak, or veal, or lamb... but the duck was calling to me on the menu, and if I could get duck to taste like this everywhere, then I'd surely switch my preferences. Very well done, and the potatoes and greens were a nice compliment.  Lastly, we had the cheese plate. Since it was only $4 per cheese choice, we decided to get all 6 options and sample them all. They all sounded so good we couldn't just choose one or two! When the cheese plate arrived it was accompanied with pecans, almonds, and figs. The goat cheese coated with oak ashes was by far my favorite, with the organic raw milk cheese as the runner up.  The cheeses we were able to enjoy were: Bleu d'Auveigne (blue cheese from France) Goat Cheese from Ste-Maure coated with oak ashes Comtomme - compton Estrie - raw milk cheese, organic Reserve de la Perade - Ste Anne de la Perade Mauricie organic 5 months Comte du Jura: France 18 months old Sauvagine, St. Raymond de Portneuf, Quebec  I love that this was off the main hustle and bustle of Rue Saint Denis, and although it is a bit on the more expensive side, it's not outlandish prices, and it's worth every penny. I would come back here in a heart beat the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem! Tasting menu quality food. As good as you can find at any downtown/old town famous restaurants that quickly get booked out. Service is very attentive and ambience relaxing and romantic. Surprised we don't find greater volume of clientele higher."}
{"text":"A wonderful evening.    Another Montréal gem.  Discovered Laloux through yelp (thank you yelp for another great find). Somewhat surprised that it wasn't so busy considering it was a Friday evening, but always happy to go for the overlooked gems.   Nice room, very simple and light.  Clean and well-maintained.  Great front-of-house staff.  Service was slightly formal and very polished and professional, becoming more relaxed as the evening progressed and a rapport was established.  Attentive without being intrusive - not something many restaurants entirely master.  It always makes me unspeakably happy to find myself in a restaurant that knows and observes the finer points of service and the staff at Laloux has manners so good as to make their mothers proud every day.  An alarming proportion of restaurants seem oblivious to the basic etiquette of service - sadly as do many customers - things like not removing a course from the table until everyone has finished so as not to single out the slower eaters among us.  Never touching a cup or glass on the rim (yes, actually I prefer that you not touch the glass in the same place where I'm going to touch it with my mouth, thanks). Unfailingly observing the correct side from which to serve and from which to remove.  Not asking how things are tasting, which whenever a server asks me that always makes me wonder why they're asking - is that server not entirely confident that what they've just given me is any good?  No missteps like these at Laloux.   Clearly the staff is proud of their kitchen - everything is presented with brief and appropriate details about provenance or process.  Their respect for their kitchen and their chef is evident, and rightly so. Every plate was a thoughtful and interesting combination of texture and flavour with nothing out of place.  The cooking style emphasizes locally sourced ingredients with a somewhat technical approach (sous-vide, foams, etc.) and a focus on texture and flavour, with impressive results.   Comprehensive wine list focused on French wine. Good selection of cocktails.    A nice variety of desserts, again thoughtful and complex without being overly demanding of your attention.    Beautifully executed food, enjoyable as something wonderful and tasty; equally enjoyable as a technical tour-de-force, as you prefer.   We had a truly enjoyable evening and I'm looking forward to my next visit to Montréal and my next visit to Laloux!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our valentines day dinner here. Our experience were truly memorable. Great service! And awesome food! Even my boyfriend, who does not like French food, really enjoyed his meal here. We got the $70 tasting menu. Everything was tasty and the order came very quickly comparing to the other fancy restaurants. Love love!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path.  Fantastic meal.  Spent four days in Montreal to celebrate our 34th wedding anniversary, and this was best-of-show in a list of great restaurants."}
{"text":"Laloux has changed chefs,menus,staff,clientele many times in the 15 years I've been dining there but what has always remained the same is the attention to detail,the clean,uncluttered lines and decor,the seemingly effortless but unwavering service,their impressive yet approachable wine selection and the food.....Yes the food.....Most of the time.  Dinner started with  glass of pinot to accompany a beautifully prepared charcuterie board displaying 4 verities of country pate,thinly sliced ham,sausage,several mustard's of both smooth and grainy and cornichons with the traditional french bread and a smooth salty butter...a good start.  A appetizer of bison carpaccio with a white mushroom sauce and popcorn was delicious,too small and confusing all at the same time...Popcorn? but the Foie Gras torchon on a brioche bun with a sweet/tart apple compote was excellent.  My lamb loin came to the table perfectly rare with a creamy citrus sauce and a fried herbed hassleback potato, a good savory presentation but again held only 3 bites at most.  A line caught tuna belly just barely introduced to a hot pan was next with a green pepper sauce was again very good.  Did this particular dinner hit all it's marks? No, sadly not. Plates were overly contrived and it's contents were under seasoned and minuscule even by Parisian standards. It was as if the kitchen put together the dishes with a photo opp in mind and forgot a actual human still need to eat,taste and be sated by it's contents..... Not to mention a rather expensive art project even with the generous exchange rates.  I still can't force myself to give less than 4 stars to Laloux because over the years I've had a few disappointing dinners there but the kitchen always seems to catch themselves when they drift too far,Chefs moved on and Laloux shines brightly once again.  I still look forward to my next meal at Laloux as should you."}
{"text":"Belle découverte...  J'ai très bien mangé et découvert un restaurant formidable. À première vue, les quantités sont petites, mais j'ai mangé à ma faim. Le décor est sobre et reposant, le service plus qu'impeccable, vraiment, rien à dire de négatif. Un endroit parfait entre amis pour un long repas qui vous permet d'échanger paisiblement. À découvrir..."}
{"text":"Hendricks Martini, $14. Martinis are $14. USD. and the food is satisfactory with small portions. There are plenty of wonderful French restaurants in beautiful Montreal, but this is one I would not recommend. Total bill: $156.95. 2 Martinis, 2 beers, 2 small tomato salads, 2 small dinner plates and lots of bread with delicious butter. No desert. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We dined here on our last night in Montreal and we were quite delighted with the fare of flavorful food with outstanding service. It was the choice of the Concierge at the W hotel that suggested we go to his favorite restaurant.   What's wonderful about our experience is that we chose the wine pairing with our own choosing of our food, not the usual Prixe Fix menu. For appetizers we dined on Green salad, confit shallot vinaigrette and Foie gras au torchon, date purée, figs and hazelnuts -- may I say DELICIOUS! My dinner consisted of Pacific Halibut, black beans, coriander salsa verde, spicy green olive salad. Wow, light and so full of flavor! My date dined on Veal sweetbreads, roasted grapes, sour dough panzanella, Pedro Ximenez vinaigrette. I tasted it and boy was it scrumptious.  A definite place to enjoy a taste of refined French cuisine without the pretentious aire."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the French bistro warmth vibe this place delivered, no over the top decor, just good food. I had their smoked trout appetizer and lamb as main. The lamb was really good! It had many different components on the plate, but all flavours worked so well with each other, apple sauce was refreshing to go with lamb :) Will definitely revisit when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Génial un des meilleurs resto ou j'ai été les goûts qu'on y trouve magnifique des bons vins et choix d'alcool bravo! Au chef j'y retourne bientôt"}
{"text":"Our first night in Montreal. I've been reading about Eater 38 Montreal for the past 3 months following their recommendations with the best restaurants in the city. Laloux was one of them. The Manager called me while we were still in LA, informing me that on the day were dining they have a special event, the 10th anniversary of Ocean Wise which they will have a prix fixe menu.  The restaurant is nice, warm greetings from the wait staff. My husband speaks a little French, so we were not totally lost with the language. The wait staff over all was attentive, even though they were extremely busy that night. I will give 4 stars for the food, awesome presentation, excellent flavors, nice combinations and seafood at its best. I won't be mum about the time frame of serving the 5 course, it was quite too long, total of 3 hours. There was a time that my son has to get up and walk outside to stretch. But I will still give them the thumbs up due to the special event.  Anyway, our experience was great and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ah sweet Laloux! Bright and simply stilish, mirrors and crispy white table cloths. Impeccable and unpretentious service. Beautiful list of wines. Laloux offered classically perfect bloody Caesar and survived the Old Fashioned test. The dishes rates of my dining companions varied from very good to excellent. I personally regret I had only few oysters, they were not only delicious, but chucked as I like them. I had the smoked mackerel instead of ordering more oysters and it was nicely prepared, but nothing to rave about. If you want to rave about an appetizer you must have the foie gras, served with solid scrape of honey comb. The beat salad is not only delicious but so aesthetically arranged that some relatives and friends were reluctant to eat from it. My main dish was the yummy venison, the accompanying squashes, mushrooms and other ingredients were blending so well with the meat. And if you order dessert don't forget that the lemon tart is one of the best things that can happen during your dinners of 2016, alternatively just get the twenty years old Armagnac!"}
{"text":"Came in with the girlfriend and her family with a reservation. We were seated promptly and greeted by a very nice server named Vincent. He was very patient and answered questions about the drink and dinner menus. The tartare was a hit as well as the oysters-which were the 2nd year in production for Quebec. We all enjoyed different main courses and everyone was pleased. The Arctic char and scallops were amazing. Everything was presented beautifully. The restaurant had a very French feel and it was a leisurely experience. Vincent was very accommodating and even gave us a taste of grappa. The chef, Jonathan was very modest; we were happy to tell him how fantastic out meals turned out. If I am ever in Montreal again I will try to come back. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"My parents are particular. They want French cuisine. Only French cuisine. The restaurant shouldn't be too far. It shouldn't be too cold, too loud, too crowded. At the intersection of this ridiculous Venn diagram was Laloux. So we went.   The place was completely empty, which I thought was surprising at 6:00pm. Not complaining though. Our waitress was completely charming, she was friendly without being obnoxious and most importantly, she withstood my father's dad jokes for an hour and a half. Bravo!  My dad tried their new tomato tart entrée, my mom went straight for the foie gras which is served in a light mango puree. I got the octopus, and I loved it! It came with fine crisps, ink, and the meat was so tender! Both my parents ordered the duck magret, and it was a 50/50 deal. My mom maintains hers was too leathery and she caught a nerve. My bavette was great, looked small but was very filling. You must think on your feet, the charming waitress arrives stealthily with a huge board of cheeses! The desserts were a bit underwhelming, the lemon tart was fresh, but a bit too minty, nothing bad to say about the profiteroles. The dulce mousse is a big blob, a delicious blob, but..blob!  I was salivating over their ornate sampling menu (urchin mousse!) but all guests have to agree to it. Some other time I guess.."}
{"text":"Great modern French bistro. The beef tartare was the best I've every had. Other dishes were solid as well including the duck and sweetbreads.  Service was impeccable as well.  Would of been 5 stars, but I found the seasoning to be some what inconsistent between dishes.  Will go back again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had a lovely dinner at Laloux! It's such a gorgeous and elegant restaurant. The atmosphere is quiet and refined, the service is considerate, and the food is quite good. The plating was absolutely gorgeous. The menu was a bit limited though; a number of items were unavailable when we arrived. Laloux is nothing mind blowing but it's certainly a decent spot for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Inventive French food with an Asian twist. 4 visits and counting. They're always up to par even if its packed. Service is absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"We went to Laloux for lunch during our visit to Montreal Jazz festival, and it was one of the most memorable meals of my life!  We got appetizer, main meal and dessert - the flavors, presentation and service were all outstanding. Will definitely be back next time in Montreal!"}
{"text":"* A bit too many ingredients at once *  Had an enjoyable meal tonight in this relaxed slightly off the beaten path bistro.    Started off with the lightly smoked scallops.  They had a nice sear and a hint of smokiness.  They were presented with a fish roe which looked like salmon roe but was much smaller.  I had not seen this type of roe before, but forgot to ask if it was a variety of salmon roe or some other fish.  There was also a fennel puree and a small dice of fruit.  Honestly there was a little bit too much going on on the plate.  The individual components were all nice, but there was just a bit too many things.    For the main I had the lobster and corn salad.  This was a very generous portion of lobster which was cooked perfectly and mixed with a variety of corn, veggies, and herbs.  A very pleasant and lighter main.  My favourite dish of the evening.    I also got to try the sweetbreads.  They were encrusted with a crust that was simply too thick.  It was almost like a fried chicken batter, yet was slightly burned.  The delicate flavour of the sweetbreads were lost in the batter.  I love sweetbreads when they are properly prepared.  Unfortunately this dish just didn't work well for me.    Many of the desserts once again sounded overly complicated.  I opted for the simplest sounding chocolate pot-de-creme which came in a mason jar.  The chocolate was the perfect consistency, and was topped with a chocolate crunch which was covered with cream.  This was a very simple clean and nice dessert.    I got to try one of the overly complicated sounding desserts - the apple 3 way which was described as:  caraway and thyme, dulce de leche ice cream, caramelized brioche, apple granite.  The pastry chef was trying to do too many things on this one.  The brioche was caramelized, but tasted slightly past its prime prior to being caramelized.  It had a slight \"not fresh\" aftertaste as if the brioche was not fresh baked prior to caramelization.  The apple granite was not found on the plate as it had all melted into a slightly too sweet liquid pool.  The dulce de leche ice cream did not have any noticeable caramel flavour.  The apples themselves were ok, but diced a bit too small to get true apple flavour from them.  Overall this dish was my least favourite of the evening.    Service was also a bit awkward and artificial at times.  Not the natural feel of many other places in Montreal.  Considering how many good bistros there are in Montreal that locally it is just 3 stars overall in my book."}
{"text":"REALLY enjoyed this restaurant on our Montreal vacation!!!   Had the BEST duck I've had in my life!  I literally closed my eyes with each bite of my Duck Magret.  It melted in my mouth and tickled my taste buds after I washed it down with a sip of Merlot.    And for such an upscale restaurant, they were extremely accomodating.  Even calling us a taxi when we finished our meal.  Maybe if I'm lucky, I will find my way back here again."}
{"text":"Great space  the food was excellent The desserts are to die for Not overly expensive or pretentious My Date was very impressed(: Service is good"}
{"text":"A Montreal classic that always delivers to expectations. Laloux is a charming, cozy French bistro that is always worth a visit. Although the overall look and feel of the restaurant is very classic, they still manage to reinvent themselves and to amaze my tastebuds everytime I eat there. It's hard for me to pick my favorite item of the menu as I often go with the daily specials, but my best advice to you is to make sure you save some room for dessert. You'll be so happy you did!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for NYE for their special 8:30 PM 7-course meal with wine pairings.  It was AMAZING!  Sure, it was expensive but it was certainly worth it, and on non-holidays not nearly as pricey.   One of the best meals I've had in my life (and I'm a tough judge).  Each dish both looked and tasted wonderful.  There were so many fine details to each entree; OK, I'm a sucker for presentation!  The sommelier and wait staff were very helpful and patient with us minimal French-speaking Americans. They're quite easy on the eyes as well.  :)  Canadian dollars: 2 prix fixe: $180 2 wine pairings: $90 4 glasses of champagne: $80 --------- $350 (~$300 USD)"}
{"text":"Um what's up with this place?? I came here with my boyfriend while on vacation based on the very strong reviews from Yelp and other internet sources. We made reservations on a Friday night, and around 8pm it was almost empty! We struggled with whether to go in or not, but decided to proceed. We thought maybe because it's been around for so long it's not as popular as the newer hyped restaurants.  When we entered we were treated with fairly cool service and despite the place being nearly empty we were seated in the one crowded corner. The server asked us our water preference- sparkling for me and still for my boyfriend. It was several minutes before they came by with the water and then they poured still into both of our cups!   We got up and left shortly thereafter. We were not about to drop $100+ per person on a restaurant that couldn't get us the right water."}
{"text":"All right, I went back to this restaurant again with the same, lovely boyfriend :) recently. Since I visited last time, their chef has been changed.  Every dishes we ordered were excellent, especially sea bream.  That dish was one of the best fish I've ever had (I'm a Japanese and I've had quite a bit of fish in my life time). Duck magret was also tasty.  The chef uses seasonal vegetables a lot and I enjoyed my asparagus salad quite a bit...yum!    I was told that the chef makes his own charcuterie, which we could have tried, but we took some vegetables instead.  Don't forget to have a dessert to finish your meal.  If you miss it, you'll regret it.  Services are friendly and attentive and food was excellent.  Great restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Sometimes it is fun to treat yourself and try out an expensive restaurant for a night of haute cuisine.  On a recent Friday night a friend and I came to Laloux, a classic French restaurant, for this kind of splurge.  The space is classic, simple yet elegant with its white tablecloths and cloth napkins.  It also has large windows which allows for plenty of natural light.  The food here is absolutely delicious and I enjoyed every bite of my meal.  My appetizer was a grilled asparagus served with an apple puree and roasted apple.  It was amazing.  The apples added a hint of sweetness to the dish.  That was followed by a Gaspor piglet which was succulent and served alongside a polenta which had been cooked so that it was crispy on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside.  For the grand finale I ordered a lemon tart which was divine.  The filling was well-balanced and the pastry crust was incredibly buttery and tender.  It was topped with a white chocolate ice cream that was excellent.  I should also add that in all cases the plating was beautiful.    Of course delicious food requires fine wine to accompany it.  Fortunately they have an extensive wine list to meet this requirement.  You are sure to find something to your liking here.  If you are in the mood for a digestif they also have a good selection of those for after the meal.    When it comes to service it was very attentive.  Our waitress checked in on us often and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  I felt like we were well taken care of during our meal.  While some may balk at the price tag it is definitely worth it.  Sure I could never come here week in and week out because it would get too expensive.  However, it is definitely worthwhile coming here when you are in the mood for a treat or to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Incredible food. A nice laid back, but very chic place. It was a special treat at the end of a great trip through Canada with my fiancée. This is the type of place (lads) that will get you far with your significant person of choice. It is not, however, a typical slap up meal. This is a high end foody establishment that a person of class would choose for a meal. The portions are not huge, it is about the flavor and artfully combined ingredients.  Once again YELP users pointed me to the right place. You have NEVER let me down! The special loving attention that I received from my love when we got to the hotel was also extremely memorable! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good restaurant in Montreal that can accommodate a large group dinner (almost 20 people). I was glad to have found Laloux for our event. Communication beforehand was ok as I did have to ask several times to get the menu sent over. For groups, they offered either 3 or 4 course dinners.   The restaurant is divided into 2 sections, we were in the half where they're trying to turn more into a bar/lounge. But that hasn't seem to have taken off yet and people were just here for dinner. We had the back area of the restaurant with a large rectangular table. Anytime there's so many people together, things get loud. 1 table nearby asked to be moved, others further away dealt with us. I do feel bad for other diners, so I wish they had a more separated area for functions like this.  The amouse bouche was actually amazing. It was a veal tataki with a small dollop of sauce that I can't remember on top. It was surprisingly light for meat and tasted almost more like tuna. It was also served on top of big cow bones which looks quite neat.  For starter, we had a choice of a tomato salad or corn soup. The salad was good but nothing too exciting. The corn soup was pretty tasty. This doesn't usually happen in French restaurants, but the soup was also a lot in volume. I had to leave half of it so I can have space for the rest of the meal.  For entree, we had a braised short rib or cod. The short rib was very tender and flavorful, probably the best thing out of the whole meal. The fish could have been cooked just a tad less. The veggies and mushrooms that accompanied it was fine but the dish was slightly bland overall.  There was some chocolate thing for dessert that was ok but didn't stand out at all. Everyone was pretty full by then so I think most people didn't finish their dessert anyways.  So overall, I think our dinner was ok. The food wasn't spectacular as I had hoped, but I think that probably comes with the territory of large group dinners. Seeing all the glowing reviews, I would definitely come back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"As many of the other reviewers have written, we had heard about Laloux from friends and were determined to dine at this restaurant. We were a party of seven with two arriving in Montreal in the evening so we had made the reservation for nine pm just to be safe.  Four of us arrived at nine and our table was waiting for us...the service and welcome was excellent. We perished the substantial wine list of mostly French selections and started off with a delicious rose from Langedoc. As the rest of our party trickled in we chatted and sipped. Once all were assembled the research began. We decided not to have the tasting menu although I was tempted but due to the sizeable our party we knew we could enjoy a large variety of dishes.  We ordered five appetizers: charcuterie, beets, wild grape gel, smoked mackerel, homemade blood sausage tart and special of snow crab and radish salad...every dish was beautiful and delicious with all diners commenting on the way the flavours were distinct and yet blended.  The second bottle was a Chenin blanch from the Loire - Bezigon 2010 on the advice of the sommelier - magnifique. As well he suggested a magnum red for our mains D'Agalis 2013 which suited our table beautifully. The mains were as follows: two orders of gaspesie Arctic char filet, scallops & sunchokes, naked oat risotto, sweetbread, honey & bee pollen while two of us ordered the aged prime rib to share. I cannot describe the beauty and flavours well enough. The fish was handled with love and care, the scallops were devine, the risotto was delicious, the sweetbreads excellent and the prime rib was perfectly medium rare and had a dark and thick reduction that was like dessert.  We could not recommend this restaurant more highly."}
{"text":"FOOD: The four stars is primarily because of the food.  It was outstanding.  From the appetizer (Pan seared foie gras, brioche, apple compote and Dégel sauce), through the entrees (Beef filet, caramelized turnip purée, kipfler potatoes, Brussels sprouts salade, buttermilk vinaigrette and the Wild striped bass, sunchoke purée, king oyster mushrooms, cipollini and dryed olives sauce vierge), and to the dessert ( Lemon curd, poppy seed cake, Meyer lemon jelly and white chocolate crumble - basically a deconstructed lemon tart) - every dish was done with great execution.  It's rare that we go to a dinner and don't find at least one criticism with the meal, but the food here was just spot on.  Nothing was over-seasoned and everything was cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend the pan-seared foie gras!  SERVICE: The waitress we had was very nice and we really have no complaints about her service.  She spoke English very well, and I was afraid that non-French speaking people would get kind of the cold shoulder but that wasn't the case.  The wine sommelier, however, was a bit smug when he realized we weren't big wine connoisseurs and asked him questions.  It's his job to educate the customers if they're unsure what they're looking for, and he just seemed like we were a waste of his time.  Definitely the turn off for the night.  AMBIANCE: We were kind of hesitant walking in because it just felt so pretentious.  I feel like they put all of the English speaking people at the front of the restaurant (where it's a lot colder by the windows) and the French speaking people in the back, closer to the kitchen.  I would give it a 2 or 3 for ambiance, just because it seemed a bit stuffy- just not our type of crowd.  We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't that full so the noise level was pretty quiet.  Which, again, kind of added to the uncomfortable stuffiness of the place."}
{"text":"After walking by this beautiful little gem of a restaurant dozens of times without noticing it, we finally tried it out for dinner on a good friend's advice and had a nearly perfect experience.  The service is impeccable and the food is absolutely wonderful. Not only is it interesting and sophisticated, but it is beautifully presented and absolutely scrumptious. For appetizers, we tried a wonderful cold cucumber soup and a black cod piece served up in a volaille bouillon with salicorne de mer and wonderful little mushrooms. For mains, we had the arctic char with asparagus and a to-die-for primavera pasta with a lemony and cheesy sauce and roasted pecans (sounds boring but trust me it wasn't).  The wine list is extensive and features a lot of french wines. I tried a delicious and unique glass of Cotes du Forez recommended by our waitress and was not disappointed.  To add to the dining experience, the very Parisian style interior is beautiful and there is a lovely little terrace (patio) out front if you want to eat outside in the summer. And last bu not least, if you want to people watch, get ready to see fairly stylish groups of people over 50. it's a nice change from plaid shirts, tattoos and beards, right?"}
{"text":"Laloux is a Montreal institution, and it's evident why as soon as you walk through the door. The service is impeccable - someone greeted us immediately, and the timing throughout the evening was perfect. Our waiter, Guillaume, is clearly a pro who loves what he does, and we had a lovely nerdy conversation about crumbers and the logistics of importing wine.  We went for the 2015 edition of Montréal à Table, which was a slightly reduced price for a three course meal including items already on their menu with one special exception - a mousse de foie de volaille that knocked our socks off. The smoky beets with root chips were also incredible and a surprise: I'm so used to every restaurant serving beets the same way, with goat cheese and acid, but these had an earthiness to them which gave them depth. The duck with risotto was very rich and we enjoyed it, but the Arctic char was a bit of a miss, lacking originality. That said, we probably wouldn't have chosen that particular dish had it not been one of the options for the evening's special.  Dessert knocked our socks off, but we couldn't even finish it. Absolutely must try their Crémant de Jura if you like to start with a glass of bubbly - we loved it and may order a case of it thanks to our server's wealth of knowledge and advice! (Fellow Yelp-ers, feel free to contact me about ordering cases of crémant to share!)"}
{"text":"The wine sommelier's at Laloux have be among the tops in Montreal. This meal was one of my most memorable meals in my life. The ambience was excellent, my group felt as if we were the only ones in the restaurant. The food was very, very good. Although the price was pretty high, this is a good bet if you'd like to spoil yourself a little bit."}
{"text":"one of my favourite french creative cuisine in mtl, it is fresh umptetentious and simple."}
{"text":"We wanted to try french food on our short stay in Montreal. Wish we could have stayed an extra couple of days to experience more cusine opts. We had an early dinner on a Monday evening passing by on our way to St. Agatha Monts. There were just a few tables occupied during our stay there, which surprised me. Most seemed like business casual folks. I had a duck magret. It was pretty good. But the portion was so small! I could have easily had 2 meals. The dish included beans and 8 or so slices of duck meat. No potatoes or rice so it wasn't filling. Maybe that's typical French cuisine. Small portions. The price was $25 for my dish. It seems that's typical price range in Montreal and for this type of food. I would probably return or try some other French restaurants the locals might recommend."}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal here a couple of weeks ago. We had a foie gras appetizer that was beautifully paired with an apple sorbet, as well as the cornish hen and duck magret main courses. Both main courses were really delicious, but they were small portions and had it not been for the appetizer, I would`ve been a little hungry.  Overall, I thought that it was slightly pricey considering what we had on our main course plate  and the boring presentation, but the food was well made and I have no complaints about it at all. My cornish hen was very tender and the foie gras pairing was fantastic. It was our first time at Laloux and after reading previous reviews, we were a little concerned, but in the end, we had a nice evening out."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting for a conference and had a lovely dinner with friends here.  The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere lovely.  I'll be dining in there the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good value and emphasis on local products is justified. good vibe, all groups seemed to be having a great time. Servers attentive and professional. I had the $68 tasting menu...good value with pre-appetizer, appetizer, pasta, meat course, amuse bouche, and dessert. Squash with airy whipped surround was stunningly textured. Citron infused halibut salad and pesto pasta with clams ideally flavored. Only misses were overly busy veal cooked 2 ways with popcorn(!) acid corn, cream corn, and a few too many things, and tough pastry and flavorless apple tart with excellent apple sorbet. I would return!"}
{"text":"Great French cuisine. Unpretentious decor. If you'd like a quiet and relaxing dinner far from the madding crowd, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Everything was a treat for our palates, a party of flavors in our mouths. One of our top 5 dining experiences ever, and this was on a Tuesday night! Can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"I live in the area and I have somehow never been to Laloux. This restaurant has been around for over 25 years but I have often overlooked it for newer glitzier restaurants. My wife and I finally went to Laloux a few weeks back and had a wonderful meal.   It's not your typical French bistro fare but rather modern French food using local seasonal ingredients. My wife had scallops with curried cauliflower and I had duck 2-ways. Delicious. What impressed me the most was the presentation, which was outstanding for a restaurant in this price range. Only downside was the slow service. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Spectacular presentation and amazing food and wine selections!  Ps: last year we discovered the bar pop and it has become my favorite hangout place in town - Scandinavian designed table and chairs, great wine selection and more importantly, 2 appetizers + 1 dessert for only $20! Still hungry? Wine+bread feeds! And you could always get another appetizer or a plate of cold meat and make an inexpensive tasting menu for $30/person. Best deal for one of the best French food in town!"}
{"text":"Maybe I loved this because I had no expectations, but I think Laloux really is a stellar spot. It's relatively small, isn't trying too hard, but manages to execute very well on food at a rather reasonable price point.   We stuck with a seafood heavy meal (a salmon, roe, sea app, arctic char with whelks and eggplant, and a local mackerel with gnocchi), swayed by the sustainability of the options, and only the appetizer wasn't a huge success. The japanese eggplant, served under the char, was literally mind blowing. If someone offered me a plate of just that, I would be more than happy: luxurious in texture, perfectly seasoned.   The wine list is fairly interesting, reasonable. They ended the meal with miniature caneles on the house, which I didn't try, but looked like a solid version.  Minus one because: there were a ton of bugs outside which I think could be partially scared off by some kind of candle/treatment and our server, while very nice, seemed to disappear, so was rather slow."}
{"text":"This place has good food but I don't think has the same value as similarly priced restaurants. There are a lot of fantastic options for restaurants in this price range like L'Express which I think deliver a lot more quality for similar price point. I would happily move up a star if the prices were lower, but that matters to me. The ambiance was quiet when I went there, and while the service was great, it was also a bit slow. We had a solid spread of the menu since I went as a group of 5, and some items were good but none were amazing particularly. Don't get me wrong - I had a good dinner, and good food, but I expected to be impressed a bit more. Maybe I went on an off night, but this is how I see it from my last visit."}
