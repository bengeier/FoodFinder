{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. They have a three person to a hookah maximum and they make you buy another hookah it was seven of us and they made us buy another lamp just for one person they have a 15% automatic gratuity added to your experience the waitresses were rude and the owner was an a****** also I asked for a glass of water and they said I can only get water if I ordered an entree which is ridiculous. Also for parties of 8 or more than 20 percent gratuity they removed all of the alcoholic beverages from the land on so its just hookah in food the food is terrible it looks like TV dinners and it was completely dead the atmosphere was boring in there was nobody in the lounge. I can totally understand why no one was there because their prices are ridiculous is $16 per land and like I said a 15 percent gratuity automatically added to your bill it was seven of us and our bill was $58 however they do take 10% off your bill if you tag them on social media which I feel is false advertising anyway. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I would not be returning for business"}
{"text":"Went there a couple days ago to satisfy my hookah urges I usually go to local hookah lounges around Lasvegas and support the small business in our area I walked in and the room was mild dark with a couple people at random tables and I was greeted after the employee was done talking to his friends , which was not cool. 

I asked for anything he suggests because I'm not a picky smoker. 

When I received my hookah it had about 6-7 small coals on it and was told that's all he has lit at the moment , I smoked it for 10 mins and it seemed not to be lit all the way I asked for new coals nd then I was brought out a new batch which was just put on my bowl still on fire . Burnt my bowl nd I told the staff about it nothing was done they left me with the bowl that was burnt 

In my experience with Hookah-lounges is a lot of people approach me if there's a complaint they  fix it right away with this one it seemed as if they didn't want to fix it

The owner then came in an employee told me that that was the owner and if I had any questions just ask I approached  the owner and asked him politely if I can get a bowl change and he told me yeah it's half-price right now if you checking yelp I told him my situation and still did not fix it nor give me a new bowl  all I really wanted was to smoke some hookah and do work on my laptop
And this whole situation ended  becoming a hour-long inconvenience"}
{"text":"Went there with an open mind excited to see the DJ and it was a shame, besides the music and surroundings, the hookah was burnt from the minute we recieved asked the owner himself to fix it which he failed to do so then the one employee couldn't fix it and was telling us it was not burnt and telling us we were wrong, so we tried to smoke but we couldnt it was horrible, we repeatedly told them and they did nothing but tell us nothing was wrong with it, I thought the customer was always rite, in this case they did nothing to help us no offer for a different bowl or anything ended up paying sixty dollars to sit there for less than an hour for harsh disgusting bowls. Worst experiance ever we will never return and never recommend it to anyone, worst customer service and hookah ever!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Hookah burned within the first 6 minutes we were here. Employees refused to replace bowl or refund money. Terrible service I DO NOT recommend this lounge to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't make many reviews but in this case, it's a must.

Recently visited this establishment and the customer service is far from being superior, not even average. It was VERY dissatisfying. 
The server seemed like she didn't know what she was doing and had no personality whatsoever. Where do they get these girls from? 
Anytime I would try to get their attention, seems like they are on their own little worlds or too busy just \"hanging out\". Really not a good look for the business but I guess whoever owns this place doesn't seem to care about what goes on. 
Another thing I noticed is the subpar bar.The drinks they have are watered down and overpriced, you might as well ask for a non-alcohol drink.
I must admit the hookah is great, but that's about the only good thing I can say about Hookah Masters.
The place is pretty big but it feels like a freezer in there.
I feel bad for those girls working there who have to walk around with close to nothing on, which by the way I think it's tacky. You've got these girls walking around with their asses hanging out, wearing fishnets. Kinda whore house-esque.
Another thing I'd like to point is, there is the DJs are average. There's really nothing special about whoever is behind that booth, pretty much supply the background music because no one gets up on the dance floor. Boring.

Overall I would not recommend this lounge to anyone. 
The two stars are for the great quality of hookah."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this lounge based on the reviews I saw here (Yelp) the place itself was okay (even though it's on the outskirts of the strip). We visited this place on a Sunday night and ordered pizza first and I must say that it was unpleasant... It was not good at all, had no flavor. We didn't eat half way when the hookah we ordered arrived (pineapple flavor). The hookah was great but after some hits I unfortunately threw up right where we sat. I didn't make it to the restroom sadly and I threw up all the pizza right by my side. I recommend this place but surely don't recommend the pizza at all. Although, I do appreciate the customer service! They helped me out by now creating a big scene about the incident."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The customer service is the worst I've ever experienced and I have been a server/bartender for over ten years all over Orange County.

So three of us came to smoke hookah and two of us just to hang out and eat. 

First we walk in and not a single person greets us. We sat there for ten minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. 

We were told we had to pay for bottled water unless we ordered food. Then were were told we had to order two hookahs even though only three is us were smoking. Then we were told that we had to order food or an extra hookah or leave. Then she didn't even bring all of our drinks. Then she took our food order one trip at a time. Then she wouldn't tell us what flavors were in the \"special\" hookah mixtures. Then she was openly rude to us and talked to us like we were 5 years old when she brought out the hookah, telling us not to knock it over. 

I'm sorry your place is clearly struggling to make money and that you can't find quality human beings to work for you. 

Good luck to you and everyone who decides to come here."}
{"text":"Hated it we walked in and they were playing a lame movie the lights were on full blast the staff was slow we weren't even there 5 minutes before we left and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hookah Masters Lounge what can I say, it's a great place to be. Karaoke night Tuesdays. Chicken shawarma wraps are unbelievably tasty. And don't forget the Hookahs and hookah girls. Currently smoking blackberry x raspberry x vanilla, it  lasts forever. Hookah  girls constantly checking on you and making sure the bowl is hitting right. Thank you HML for making every Tuesday so much fun for me"}
{"text":"$77.35 for 3 AYCS, a burger, fries, and a drink.
A little too pricy for me personally since most places are $35 AYCS for 3 people.
The hookah girl is pretty, but she's not very attentive (we had to ash the coals ourselves for the majority of the time) it seems like a family owned place though so there's that
At first an obscure movie was on, and after ESPN, so that was cool! I heard that this place was supposed to have music, but unfortunately not on my visit :(
The lighting is nice and the lounge is big so we didn't have too sit TOO close to anyone so that was nice :)
They only let you change the shisha after an hour so we had to keep smoking even when it started to get harsh (we could have waited it out but waiting 20min+ for a new flavor just seemed too much of a waste)
Overall it's a nice place to go to if you don't want to be bothered (starbuzz is great if you like attentive staff!) the staff here is really chill but they don't really smile or come by at all really, you kind of have to flag them down
The food was good! Burger was on in-and-out level (which is decent) but the fries were just amazing (as amazing as plain fries can be!)
I don't think I'll be back, but I had a nice time :)
Definitely too pricy for the service you will get though, for sure
If the service was better, I'd be willing to spend more though!"}
{"text":"Came in to Hookah Masters to watch the Seahawks,  service was amazing reasonable prices. Huge big screen. Definitely wil be back bestvSEAHAWKS BAR in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for hookah every day. Here every day after work and never have anything less than the best service. Hookah lasts long and I enjoy the atmosphere. There are live DJ's and on the weekend it's usually poppin'. Definitely the place to go. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a week night and it was terrible. The hookah hardly hit and to get the waitress to help us, get new coals, or even our bill was almost impossible. We left and went straight to a better hookah lounge."}
{"text":"I used to come here after school at CSN. They moved, but I don't know where... Any help?"}
{"text":"This place is really chill best spot to be at. bring the friends, family any body. DJ hitting the best beats really fun"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in we had the worst customer service, throughout the night the waitress and manager made us feel very uncomfortable I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. Save your time and money and look elsewhere! I would say this place relates to crying babies in NAZI Germany!"}
{"text":"Service was great, our server Jocelyn Padilla was very attentive to our prefered needs, she changed the channel to what we wished to watch & was working her hardest! hookah was very good."}
{"text":"Great hookah bar. With good bucket deals for beer. Tried the hookah with a pineapple bowl, was awesome but the best hookah was the Blue Barbie. We went on a night with kareoke and was a lot of fun for me and my friends. I would definitely recommend this place. Great service!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the vibes! Would come back again! We had a really cool server named Kendra! Flavor flavs were boooomb!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best  hookah lounge in Las Vegas . They have an awesome menu selection and tasty . I will definitely be coming back . Hookah masters has the best atmosphere in town I would recommend to stop going any where else and come here ."}
{"text":"Awesome hookahs and I'm picky
Outstanding management and staff
Jess was on point helpful n friendly 
Family owned and operated"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed by my daytime visit for food- the location is lit like a nightclub 24/7, even at 11AM on a Sunday when all I wanted was to satisfy a killer wing craving.

As it is, they seem to have a group of regulars sitting at tables and watching Law & Order with their laptops and a hookah, seems like a chill place to hang out and get work done. Wifi is free, which helps. There's hookah smoking here but no cigarette smoking allowed, which I appreciate because I can't stand that smell.

Lady we placed order with was friendly, her mom was the cook, order took about ten to fifteen minutes to come out, which was fairly reasonable. Had time to sit and look around, liked the lighting effects and modern décor/seating, but found it odd that they don't have more lights on during the day or anything to make it a little more restaurant-like for non-nightclub hours.

Food itself was just okay: 12 piece spicy garlic wings just tasted like mild buffalo sauce and no garlic, for 12 wings we were given 2 tiny cups of ranch which would not have been sufficient if they were the spice temperature we actually ordered. The beef shish kabob wrap was dry and had no sauce, side of Caesar salad was bagged at an angle so the dressing dripped out of the box and all over the bag.

EDIT: Subtracted an additional star after a traffic incident with an employee in a company truck covered in HML contact info and logos. He was speeding, tailgating, and nearly sideswiped my car in 5 o'clock traffic about a block away from the lounge. Dangerous on it's own, unprofessional when representing your company. I would have given them another chance before, now I won't be."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, but after the last time we will probably not go back. The first time we went they had a 21+ section and an 18+. Both sides were fun with a lot of people and great music. This last time we went was an awful experience. They don't have a bar anymore which is part of the reason we went to this one. There was hardly anyone onside when we got there at 9 and by 11:30 when we left it still only had a few people. They apparently don't play any music until 10 pm so they had Pawn Stars playing on all of their tvs. The staff didn't check on us at all unless we asked. The hookah was so bad. The smoke was not thick at all and the staff wouldn't put more coals on for us. I don't think they loaded our bowl right. The staff looked preoccupied with being on their computers or doing whatever and not helping us. I will never go back to this one. Just a really bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been here at least once a week over the past couple weeks. This place would be popping if they had a better music section. They place teenage girl music instead of popping club music or typical hookah lounge music, and when you ask them to change it, the waitresses get snooty and say they can't change it, 20 minutes later I watched them get up to the sound booth and change it. 
Also the price is good for the hookah, and fries are bomb but they charge gratuity for every transaction and in my opinion it was not worth a tip. One time the waitress did not even service us for almost 45 minutes. And the hookah got burnt and we wanted to order drinks. 
Can't decide if I'll be going again."}
{"text":"I am originally from Los Angeles and we have a lot of Hookah Shops around here, but man this place is amazing, the food, the hookah, the music and most important of all Sarkis. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great tasting, clean hookahs & huge variety of flavors. The only hookah place we've found that's open during the day as well as at night. Very relaxing vibe during the day, like you're in your own living room.  The owner is attentive to the customers' needs...very friendly, but if you're on your laptop or are there for some down-time, he respects that while making sure your hookah is attended. Unlike other places our hookah never dies out, they're on top of it here with fresh coals often. We've been there at night too...totally different vibe. DJ, dancing girls, flashing lights, mesmerizing water display over the bar, bottle service available and VIP room. 
Oh, and the food: so far we've only had burgers, kabobs, fries and lebne and it's all great (and we don't take the quality our burgers lightly)!  Lebne is a mediterranean yogurt that Sarkis (the owner) recommended and now I'm hooked, gotta have it at least once a week!
Love this place! And they have a place right next door for the 18-20 crowd!"}
{"text":"Went last week just bad service and no alcohol anymore. They use to have alcohol not anymore. Their hookah was so ashy and the smoke was just not that good."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, great tasting and the hookah hit very well. The food was fantastic, usually hookah bar food falls short but this place has it on point. The only critique I have to make it an A++ experience would be if they used better coals, they get way too ashy."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, food was terrible. Save your money and go to McDonalds if you want to eat. Was waste of money and time ;/"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE! The girls are rude as hell... No wonder the place is dead. Three people to a hookah? The waitress told us that if we didn't buy another hookah then we had to leave. The place is already dead as hell and they want to kick us out? They need to get shut down. Waste of space!"}
{"text":"Hookah Masters? Hookah masters my ass. If they're hookah masters, I'm a Hookah God. I am a Messiah of Hookah.

I am from Los Angeles and I came here with good expectations since the lounge I go to in LA recommended me to go here. When I first came in, I decided to order a pineapple bowl since I thought it was going be my last bowl of 2014. I was literally getting no cloud from this pineapple bowl. They didn't fix it and instead, the owner Sargis tells me that fruit bowls are not about thick clouds and smoke. At first, I just told myself that if that's the case of the fruit bowl, then I guess fruit bowls suck and I'm never going to get it again. But during few days after I came back from Vegas, I decided to get pineapple bowl from other lounges and my god, I get really fruity nice thick smooth clouds and smoke out of it while lasting over 2-3 hours. I came to realize that Hookah Masters are nowhere near being masters of packing bowls.  I was heavily disappointed with this lounge.

Although I shouldn't have done this, I decided to get a regular refill because I didn't enjoy the pineapple head that they served while I craved to smoke because I literally got no smoke out of pineapple and it didn't feel like I smoked anything. So I decided to get Fumari Spiced Chai and Fumari Lemon Mint. Bowl burnt out after 20 minutes, and flavors tasted weird and burnt out. I've smoked in my house and also in other lounges, so I am very aware of what it's supposed to taste like.

They use low quality Exotica 8.1 charcoals. Ashes stick to the coals like a magnet, so they're hard to ash off. Since ashes cover the coals by sticking to the coals, it decreases the heat output, hence, not heating the shisha effectively to give good thick clouds. Only way to take ashes out of the coals is to use the tongs and carve it out using edges of coal plate. You can't even blow them out. Terrible charcoals. They use crap quality Egyptian hookah Caravans. KM is superior to Caravans and after smoking at top quality lounges in LA where they use KM hookahs, Caravans do not compare. Dream hose is the only thing great about this lounge. I have a dream hose and dream hose gives good clouds since it retains the smoke and has no leak throughout the hose but yet, for me to get no clouds while using dream hose, it's clearly their lack of skills in packing hookah while using low quality hookah parts and coals.

Yelpers, beware. If you plan to redeem your check-in discount, you will be required to write a 5-star review for this lounge in order to claim your discount. LMFAO. What a joke. Every 5-star reviews I've written for the lounges I enjoyed never required me or even told me to write a review for them. I've done it on my own will because their places and lounges were awesome that they deserve to be known by others of what kind of experience I had with the lounges. Why not advertise on yelp site like this then \"Check-in and write a 5-star review for 50% off on regular refill\"? If you are not satisfied with people wanting to check-in and redeem the discount, don't offer it at all."}
{"text":"This place is always great. I occasionally go in with friends to smoke, and other times go in to get supplies for my own Hookah. The staff is always super friendly and great to chat with. The hookahs are always really tasty and last for hours. I usually get a watermelon fruit bowl when I go, and with them constantly replacing the coals, we usually have it going for 3-4 hours before our lungs give out haha. But seriously, this place is awesome and I love it. The tea and food are great too!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout with friends. Separate rooms for 18 and 21+. You can even order food. (Wings are bomb!) Several hookah flavors to choose from. Big dance floor and poles. Music is always on point!"}
{"text":"Best Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas! Very spacious with 100's of different hookah flavors! Fantastic food and great selection of Beers and liquors! Two venues for a 21+ crowd and an 18-20 crowd make for smart business too! Great Atmosphere, bring your friends for a great time! Live DJ's on the weekend and even Karaoke! What more could you ask for?! Love it!"}
{"text":"I've decided to rewrite my review. I've been to worse, and I've been to better. I like the atmosphere of the place but I'd prefer the music to be a bit lower so I won't have to talk too loudly and have those awkward moments when the music stops and there's that one person yelling. Kendra is really sweet and outgoing and I did judge her based off her uniform at first but I was wrong. I prefer coco coals and the coals they have ash a little too quickly. I'd like it more if they switched to black diamond coals. They don't have an all you can smoke but a hookah is about $15 and each bowl lasts for about 3 or 4 sets of coals. The area is convenient as well. 

To the owner and Kendra due to my last review: I'm sorry for being as rude as I was."}
{"text":"I've been here twice at night and both times have been awesome. They play great music and they change it up. The owner is such a great guy! He's super fun and he loves to come by and make sure everything's good and the employees always come by and fix the coals and bring you whatever you need. The atmosphere is fun and it's so spacious and chill. Definitely a great spot to meet up with friends and just chill"}
{"text":"Here again chilling. What can I say good servers, flavorful hookah, tasty and home made food, drinks kick ass too. Over all since Jokers of Clubs closed one of my two favorite places to chill out."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this business at the time back in 2013. I feel bad for saying this, because I normally try to only give feedback on the positive things, but this time has to be different. To elaborate now my fiance and I both got immediate headaches from the hookah. We both used to smoke hookah, so we can conclude it was not prepared well. My fiance actually ended up throwing up in their bathroom from the hookah. We didn't feel welcome here from the lack of sincerity from the employees.

 The owner messaged me on Yelp mentioning a change in staff. That's great and I hope you do better with new faces and management. I appreciate you reaching out 1 year later, but I'm leaving my review since it was an actual experience I had. 

--------  original review ---------

The music was so loud I couldn't chat with my friends. The prices are too high for below average bowls. I got a head ache and sick from smoking it. Staff isn't friendly at all. I didn't feel welcome there either. I would never come back here again."}
{"text":"Watched the Seahawks here last night, watching the Cardinals now the big screen is awesome!!!! The burger was delicious. :) full bar with beer on tap and great pricing on bottle service"}
{"text":"We don't smoke, but we're always looking for good Mediterranean food, so we decided to give the place a try. It's a nice-looking place, but more loungy than restauranty. We had the chicken kabob with rice and salad. It was good, but not outstanding as the chicken was a little dry. It was lunchtime on a Saturday and there were only a few customers, mostly smoking hookah and working on their laptops. I always thought hookah smoking was a social activity, but all these folks were there alone and spread out throughout the room. There wasn't any music. It was very quiet except for the sound of a cop show on the TVs and.....coughing. Hopefully it's more lively later in the evening, but the food just isn't amazing enough to draw us back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its a great place to hang out with friends.
the owner Sarkis is very friendly and nice.
the hookah was awesome!! i would visit more often had it been closer to where I live."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Vegas. Huge location, everything's clean, food's great, but most importantly they treat me like family here. Amazing food too by the way."}
{"text":"This lounge is a hidden gem! It's really hard to find good lounges like this in Vegas. The bowls are well-packed and one of the few I know of that serves tangiers. The service is good too, and the prices are really good! They also play BOMB music haha."}
{"text":"Great place to chill with friends any night of the week. Great staff great food and an amazing bar."}
{"text":"Me and my girl went into the lounge about 10 didn't get a hookah for almost 30 minutes. I felt bad only one guy was working and running around like crazy not really his fault. Hookah was not that good the coals got ashy really fast and the bowl got harsh even faster after only about 30 minutes. I didn't try any of the food just the hookah. Don't plan on going back for the money I rather go back to other hookah lounges in the valley that were the same price or cheaper. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Could be a lot better if they got the hookah right!"}
{"text":"I really like coming here when it comes to karaoke. My friends always come around, the place is rather packed, and the sound system is awesome. Lastly, the workers are very good in keeping tabs on who needs to be assisted when needed. I can't wait to go tonight!"}
{"text":"Really spacious venue. DJ was playing mostly EDM and was fun for a Thursday night! (But good job DJ Vendetta!) The food selection was good. The staff was friendly which is always a plus. The waitress replaced our hose once just to make sure the flavor was fresh. My friends loved the hookah here. I don't smoke hookah so I went to the bar. The limit on credit cards is $10 which is understandable. The bar tender was friendly and nice but the bar top was so high and I'm a short girl. The bartender was nice and friendly. I think I'll try coming on a weekend one day to see if it's more popping!"}
{"text":"Food, DJ, Alcohol and HOOKAH!  All in one!  What more do you need in vegas."}
{"text":"The owner here is awesome and so is the service. Sarkis packed me the best hookah bowl I have had.

Also.. Free wifi and very nice staff. They also have Fumari which is rare.. Great flavor and charcoal was always changed when it needed to be.

Overall great experience. Will always come back when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to ask waitress multiple times for everything. The entire time. Plus they add 15% gratuity to all checks no matter the size of your party!!! The manager is an asshole also"}
{"text":"Really nice lounge BUT ridiculous rules. I visited with 4 friends. A few of my friends wanted glasses of water and they were told they couldn't have a any if they weren't ordering food (even though 3 out of the 5 ordered food). Also, we had to purchase two hookahs for 5 people because they have a 3 person max on each hookah. We are from out of town and were 5 of the probably 8 people there so it kind sucked that they couldn't bend the rules enough to give them water and allow my two friends to sample our hookah since it was a new experience for them that they weren't sure if they would like or not. We end up purchasing two hookahs. One of the people that I was with was asked to take her hood off her head even though we had been sitting at the table for about 35 minutes. The woman that waited on us was extremely nice though. It seemed like EVERYTIME she came back out to us there was new rules that she had to explain to us. It seemed like she was getting coached from the manager. We all received our foods about a hour later. I was the only one who enjoyed my food. One of my friends was served rice and a piece of old salmon. She told the waitress that she didn't want it and we had no time to wait for another dish. He refused to take it off of the bill. We were treated like crap by the manager and we were the only people in there that weren't there just for the wifi. We should have listened to our first instinct and left before continuing with our orders."}
{"text":"we went on a dead night. I want to come back on really good nights. love the place, it looks like a blast if it gets busy. loved their wings and hookah."}
{"text":"The wife and I were visiting Vegas for a few days and looked at every hookah lounge in the area.  This is by far the best. The owner is pretty awesome and knows his shit. They only use the best hookahs(KM) and flavors. No over price marked up BS like rumbar($35 for a standard hookah and ONE coal!) just because it's Vegas.  This is a real hookah bar for people that love hookah.  

We went on a Sunday night so it was quiet which was what we were looking for.  This place definitely has the club vibe. So if you're not into that come on a slow night. 

If I had any constructive criticism for the owner....  I would say do the club vibe on a few nights a week and on the other nights,  turn off the smoke machine and strobes and just let it be more of a relaxed vibe, and more of a lounge.

All and All I will be back!"}
{"text":"Scantly Clad Waitress, Decent Hookah, and Great Menu 

Everywhere my hubby and I travel we always try a new hookah bar (we met at one). So why would Las Vegas be any different?

We were initially going to go to Luna Lounge on the strip (Thanksgiving night and they were closed) so we ended up at Hookah Masters Lounge (HML) which was a pleasant surprise.

Hookah and Server: I will say I was a little hesitant when we walked in an the server was prancing around in underwear but she was wonderful! Super friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. My fiance is Arab and of course only smokes double-apple(no matter where we go) so of course this was different, but to our pleasant surprise they had Nakhala - which is what many traditional smokers use. The hookah wasn't ours (of course we think we have best at home) but it was good - the server was efficient at keeping hot coals on the hookah and consistently checking on us and each of the patrons...maybe her efficiency came from a lack of pants? Meh - she was was awesome. 

Atmosphere: and setup in a way that could accommodate several large groups of people. Being over the age of 18 we still decided to sit on that side of the establishment as it was more populated.  

Food: Although we didn't actually eat there we did receive a menu to look over and by reviewing it they have a great selection ranging from appetizers, sandwiches, and entrees. Hummus, Hummus w/Sherwma, Mozzarella Sticks (can't go wrong with fried cheese), Sherwma Sandwhichs (Beef and Chicken), and even platters Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob, and Kafta Kabob... Just to name a few."}
{"text":"Hookah Master's Longe I personally would like to thank all of you for the amazing time That I had during my first day back in Las Vegas. The staff here is on point and are always there to follow through with there service. Great Drink prices amazing hookah!!! The owner is very down to earth and the waitresses are beautiful and attentive. I definitely recommend this play to any Las Vegas Hookah lover. 5 Stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"So i came to this hookah lounge about 2 months ago on a trip with my girlfriend to vegas. Her friends decided to take us out to this hookah lounge that night but my god was it horrible. For starters before even entering the hookah lounge you are completely taken back by the horrible odor surrounding the location. Thanks to the lounge being built on top of a sewage line all you can smell on the way in, is all of Las Vega's combined bathroom trips. As soon as you get past the horrible smell and make it through the doors you should be fine considering most of the smell is masked by hookah flavors. The lounge is incredibly huge, however, the space between the tables and walls make you feel like you're smoking hookah in an airplane hangar. I don't know about you guys but that just makes me feel awkward. The service is horribly slow, the manager relies on the staff of all women prancing around in their underwear to cover up the fact that no one working there cares about you as a customer. The owner/DJ takes it upon himself to put the music up to a point where the person 2 inches away from you can't hear you scream. Lets not forget the prices, they conveniently forget to mention the fact that there is not only a one drink minimum per person but also a seating charge. Instead they leave that bit of information hidden in the menu for you to find your self. 
Now lets move on to the most important part of a hookah lounge, its hookah. The hookah was simply average, not exactly the level of someone who calls them selves a \"hookah master\". 
1) Packed above the rim - you should never do this, it burns the flavor out too quick
2) Too much water in the base - Makes the hookah produce less smoke all the while still burning your flavor, which leaves you unsatisfied and cheated.
3) Flavor burned too quickly - Within 15 mins of smoking the flavor burned out which isn't normal at all, I can pack a hookah at home while half-ass-ing it while 4 people smoke it, and it'll last at the very least 30 mins.

Overall my experience at Hookah Master's Lounge was pretty bad as you can tell. If you still want to test your luck then try it out, you might catch them on a better day then I did. They should consider taking the master out of their title, they really don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Hello, I was just there on 5/28/16 and was served by ROCHELLE (if she even gave me the right name, she's tall and has blonde hair ).  My friend and I ordered a apple bowl with blue mist.  After waiting for 35 minutes, we received a hookah with a normal bowl (not the apple bowl we ordered).  After telling Rochelle that she got our order wrong, she just said, \"I guess that's what i heard ,\" and walked away without even trying to correct the \"so heard wrong\" order or even saying sorry.  We were so mad and we wanted to leave, but we decided to at least pay for the water that we ordered.  After paying $5 for 2 bottles of water, SHE LITERALLY THREW OUR CHANGE ONTO THE FLOOR and was yelling at us.  I told her  that I will tell the hookah owner how horrible she is treating his customers while he is not there, and she said that he is a dick and that she doesn't care!  so disappointing. please don't go here, so many more better places! PLEASE AVOID!"}
{"text":"Good place. Great atmosphere, music, food, and the hookah is smooth and well tended. They have a great selection of hookah flavors from both Starbuzz and Al Fakhir brands."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for hookah. The focus here is the actual hookah and compared to other places in Vegas, this place definitely sets the standard. Sarkis, the owner, was very helpful and friendly. He made some great recommendations for my husband and I to try. 

They have the most amazing water showcase for the backdrop of the bar. It's mesmerizing and really cool to watch.  We went on a Sunday so the DJ was not spinning, but they still had good music videos playing all around with projection screens. The color changing lights and the black lights help set up the ambiance. 

They cater more towards the local crowd, but for people from LA that have seen every kind of hookah place imaginable, this lounge is pretty perfect. We will be telling our friends about it, and coming back when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Where to start? Awesome place staff was amazing they love to take care of their guests, I highly recommend this awesome lounge. Definitely my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"My trip to hookah masters was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a hookah lounge. I don't know where to begin. I'll start with one of the most important aspects of a business, the customer service, which was basically non-existent, minutes after we recieved our hookahs, the tobacco in one started to get burnt, we all smoke our fair share of hookah so we know what we were talking about, so we started to complain about it, so the employee tried a couple troubleshoots, but was not able to get rid of the burnt flavor, then a female from another table approached ours who claimed to work there, and basically argued with us and was extremely rude. We stopped smoking that hookah and when we went to pay they still charged us for it without doing anything to try to accomadate us. Besides the \"customer service\" the music they played was not the right type for a lounge and brought our mood down. The only thing they have going for them is that their wings were delicious which is why I gave them two stars, but I highly recommend going to another lounge, there are many other good ones in the area!"}
{"text":"This spot is very spacious with numerous spots to sit. They have TV's and one projector screen along the walls. They play hip hop music and had the videos up. Everyone was friendly and helpful; the hookah is reasonably priced and they have an all you can smoke option. The hookah bowls last awhile and with the coals being refilled. Definitely will be back here. We didn't try the food, so no comment on that. All they need is a liquor license and they would have 5 stars from me :) 

They have wifi for gamers to come in and chill and play. There was also people playing chess. Awesome spot to hangout in the afternoon and evenings!"}
{"text":"This establishment really provides me with all of my hookah needs. lol The food is amazing as well! Always love seeing my favorite server, Jocelyn. Such a beautiful girl and extremely attentive. I practically live here as it is but I'll never stop coming to Hookah Masters. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The guy who served us the hookah was really rude. We would ask questions about the menu and he would just sigh like we were dumb and roll his eyes. My brother asked what the Cosmopolitan tasted like and the guy rolled his eyes and was like \"The drink??\" Honestly just he was really rude and we definitely won't be going back, and I'll probably tell people not to go there/I'm definitely not going to recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great people , great atmosphere, great service and super chill spot to relax and have a good time !!"}
{"text":"I came here to welcome my friend home from the military expecting to hear a live DJ with a bar and good hookah... Well not so much! When we walked in there was only maybe 5 people in the whole building... The environment was nice and reminded me of a ultra lounge... The music was playing but not to loud they said they can only turn it up after a certain time... I asked where the jd was and they said they currently didn't have one... So next best thing was alcohol but nope the don't have there liquor license yet... They did have a great selection of hookah and staff was nice but they should get things together"}
