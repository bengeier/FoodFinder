{"text":"This is my first review. I have always relied on yelp but not today. They only have ground beef and the chicken is cubed like you would buy it in a bag the salsa is out of a can wait maybe a jar. I've had a better burrito at Taco Bell no joke."}
{"text":"Got the beef burrito.  It was fantastic!  Huge, great flavor, and the hot salsa was perfect level of spiciness.  Did I mention huge...it had to weight over a pound.  And free refills on the sodas.   Loved it."}
{"text":"Great quick meal especially if your looking for a vegetarian option in Carolina Mall. Which is located in concord. Now there are several places to choose from in the food court but I prefer them. I typically get a naked burrito. I layer my toppings on the lettuce bed and use chips to eat them. And I ask for extra beans and rice because I don't eat the meat. They have a good selection of veggies to put on as well as sour cream and salsa. Daily lunch specials keep it affordable!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside Carolina Mall and just for some folks who don't know where it is, it's located in Concord NC right next to the hospital. If I remember correctly, this place used to be Sbarro Pizza. 

I have been to this place quite a few times by now and I can honestly say that I have tried almost all their items but ONLY vegetarian. This is a perfect spot because it's right next to Papa John's pizza. So if kids wants to eat pizza where as someone like me Who is craving for Mexican food than it works out quite well. 

People here are friendly local people and I think it's even owned by local which is pretty good. I am all for supporting local as long as I get good tasty food at reasonable price :D 

If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend this place."}
