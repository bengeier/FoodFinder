{"text":"If you're looking for good Caribbean food try Quidley's Delight at 11915 N Tryon St. Their number is 704-910-1781. They are right next to the barber shop. It's a lovely family run restaurant with both eat in and take out. Great food and friendly people. We should support small businesses like this! My mom and I had a wonderful dinner there tonight. I was really impressed with the food."}
{"text":"I have searched high and low since I moved to the south from N.Y.  to find authentic carribean food..the heavens opened and out fell \"Quidleys\".. I can officially feel at home now! The food is amazing.. owner is hilarious! please all my fellow W.I please support.. i promiss you it taste the way its supposed to..I was about to give up on my search!"}
{"text":"Our first time and selected to carryout due to our schedule but there are tables for dining.  Excellent cuisine!  Friendly staff! A great place for fried snapper and jerk shrimp."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some island fare, check this place out!   Get any kind of shrimp!!!!! Delicious."}
{"text":"Good Jamaican food. Fresh and hot. Get there early cause they do sell out. Brown stew chicken was excellent. Oxtails were small but flavorful. Whole fish was fried to perfection. The patties were awesome!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Jamaican food and Quidley's does not disappoint!  I've tried so many other spots here in Charlotte and they don't hold a candle to Quidley's.  Be warned, the prices are steep...but if you're like me and love good food, you don't mind paying for high levels of satisfaction!  As a first timer, I had to try several items to make sure that it wasn't all hype. The brown-stew Snapper was Excellent! The oxtails were Excellent...perfectly seasoned and tender. They are small but delicious. I loved the pumpkin rice much better than the rice & peas. The cabbage was awesome, so were the yams and potatoe salad.   I'll have to try a chicken dish on my next visit...which just might be TODAY! Pad your wallets and go give your taste buds a delightful treat!"}
{"text":"I ate at Quidley's for the first time this evening and it was amazing! I ordered the large jerk chicken plate with plantain and yams. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The best Caribbean food I had since i moved to Charlotte from up north. I been down here over 3 years and where I'm from we have a high population of people from the Caribbean island so I'm used to top notch Caribbean food and Quidleys is where it's at. They even have delicious snapper fish and oxtail and even some of the good Caribbean spots can mess that up. However i only gave it 4 stars because a combo dish meal is $16 and to me that's a bit pricey but the food is good so guess I don't always have to get a combo."}
{"text":"Food so good ate dinner here two days in a row.  There was a wait the first night but I was prepared for a wait and the food was worth it. Everything was so full of flavor.  Tried the curry goat with plantains and mixed veggies fist night.  Second night the jerk chicken.  Loved both meals.  A new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff was the first thing we noticed when we walked in.  Not a great location but the food made up for that. I ordered the jerk chicken. It came with a cabbage side that was great and some of the best potato salad I have ever had. We will stop in again when we are back in town"}
{"text":"Tried something new with my 11 year old daughter. Forget that it is located in a little strip mall.  The inside is clean and neat.  I had the oxtail with rice and peas and cabbage.  The plating was really pretty.  Then I took my first taste and was amazed at how great it was. Everything I had was fresh and tasty.  My daughter loved her barbecue chicken.  They even gave her a sample of the pumpkin rice and she lived that too."}
{"text":"They do not hold back on the portions the buttery shrimp is to die for. This will be our go to spot for now on the others in the area can't compare"}
{"text":"My wife and I truly enjoyed our first visit to Quidleys Delight!  We do not have much experience with Caribbean food but I was impressed by the reviews on Yelp so we gave it a chance.  Thank Goodness we did because it was awesome!  The Curry Chicken was great, tender flavorful, stew-like.  The pumpkin rice was very good, nice flavor, pretty color.  The rice & beans were what you would expect.  We tried the Snapper Brown Stew at the suggestion of the staff and it was quite tasty.  A whole fish deep fried then stewed with vegetables in a sweet flavorful brown sauce.  It takes patience to carefully pick out the meat and to avoid the fish bones.  The plantains were so-so (my wife makes wonderful plantains) and finally the cabbage side dish was yummy too.  The staff were so pleasant and friendly.  The food took quite a while to prepare which I believe was due to the Brown Stew Snapper."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST Caribbean food I've encountered in charlotte and I think I've tasted almost every Caribbean restaurant here. I had a curry goat/curry chicken combo plate with rice and peas, cabbage and yams and a side of pumpkin rice (just so I could taste it). The food was delicious and nicely played and more than I expected. The curry goat was low in bones and fat and the curry chicken white meat was moist and succulent. The location isn't the best but it was definitely worth the drive. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"This place has the most aMAZing, flavorful food I've had the pleasure to consume. Seriously, you need to try this establishment if you haven't already.   My husband had the jerk chicken, pumpkin rice and candied yams. The chicken was dooooo tender and had the perfect kick to it. I had the Creamy Butter Shrimp, pumpkin rice, plantains and potato salad and every single item on my plate was excellent.   Portion sizes were perfect; not too little, not too much. Wait staff was friendly and professional. I'm putting this on my favorites list. I wish there was a Quidley's in Greensboro."}
{"text":"THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. We order the curry goat, fish, and oxtail. The food was warm and tasty with a lot of flavor. The owners of the store were extremely nice and you can tell they take a lot of pride in their food. Inside of the restaurant was very clean and modern. I really enjoy their restaurant and I see myself coming back here. Also it's close to UNCC so I recommend any student to come here for a good meal. My parents are Jamaican so I KNOW THE REAL DEAL WITH JAMAICAN FOOD AND THIS IS IT!!!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible I have no idea how it got so many good reviews. When I went they only had 2 chicken options because they where out of everything else. Chicken has the bone in so I was constantly picking through sharp bones. Beans and rice was mushy and tasteless. Not to mention there are no refills and flies everywhere."}
{"text":"Finally found a place to satisfy my greedy palate. Creative flavors thats not too salty or spicy. I ordered jerk chicken, pumpkin rice, cabbage and plantains."}
{"text":"I've never been to this section of the city. The restaurant is located in a small strip mall with hardly any other businesses to mention.  Overall, the food was really good. However, I am from NJ. West Indian restaurants are plentiful and they have amazing food as well. The one difference is the price. We opted for the oxtails/jerk chicken combination with rice and beans, cabbage and sweet potatoes. We shared it but there wasn't much meat to share, or cabbage. I was disappointed with the portion. I would've expected more protein for the price. The menu said that roti skins came with the meals, but they don't. They are $4 extra. We also ordered the fried shrimp with rice and beans, and sweet potatoes. The shrimp was good. Not sure if I would return. Again, the food was good, I had no complaints with the taste, only the portion."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in North Charlotte, Withrow Downs area across from the new Walmart. The food was great! Not your stock flavors either. Everything dressed up and seasoned nicely. I ordered Jerk Chicken (more sweet than spicy) Cabbage, which was very tasty, and Pumpkin Rice! Everything made with care and the chef preparing the food right in front of you. Clean interior, nice music, ample parking and very attentive staff."}
{"text":"I have been craving Caribbean food for some time and visited Quidley's Delight.  I have mixed reviews about the restaurant.  It is definitely inviting with lots the natural light, the d√©cor is simplistic and tasteful, and the staff is helpful.  I had curry shrimp which is made to order and emphasized several times not to include onions.  I heard the person who took my order advise the kitchen staff several times of my request to cook without onions.  The curry shrimp contained onions that I had to remove prior to eating anything and it had too much of what tasted like butter.  Also, the bell peppers did not taste fresh, so I removed those as well.  I ordered steam rice which appeared to have too much butter added during preparation, I could not eat it.  I ordered plantains and specified to slice thin prior to cooking.  The plantains were cut thick, I could not eat them.    Although the curry shrimp was good after I removed the onions and bell peppers, and discarded the accompaniments; I was disappointed to have wasted money, time, effort and gas to purchase a meal that I could not consume in its entirety.  I am not sure that I'll give Quidley's Delight another chance, as my first experience was not good at all."}
{"text":"Have you ever said to youself, \"that place was great when they first opened\"? Well, Quidley's Delight just opened, and they're great. I hope they keep it that way! Quidley himself will cook your meal in front of you while you wait. Just don't be in a hurry.  It may be easy to miss this place. They are right on US 29 North of Charlotte, but the speed limit is 55 and everybody blasts past the place. I circled twice looking for it and still never saw the banner out front. Even after parking, they have poor signage in the parking lot and it was still hard to find. But don't give up, because they are cooking up some yummy food.  We tried the fried snapper topped with veg and the jerk chicken. They were both really good and watching your fish fry in front of you adds to the whole experience. The beans and rice and pumpkin rice we're both good options, don't know if I could say one was better than the other. Do try the candied yams. They were wonderful.   As others have pointed out, the prices are pretty steep. But in my opinion they have a quality product and are justified. Will be back soon for curry chicken and beef patties with coco bread."}
{"text":"Cute little spot off of North Tryon serving a nice variety of Jamaican dishes.  So far I've tried the curry chicken, veggies and rice and beans which was not the best curry chicken or rice and beans but just ok.  The oxtails and pumpkin rice were excellent, well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  They also offer fresh juices, the carrot seems to be popular."}
{"text":"Food was amazing had jerk snapper best in charlotte I usually frequent Caribbean hut but unfortunately after having this I'm switching it up customer service was also excellent and it was clean in there"}
{"text":"The food is very good at Quidleys. There is inconsistency with the foods at times. The pumpkin rice is very good. I usually get the fish but my husband likes the curry goat. The location is off 285 on Tryon in a shopping plaza.   I can cook my own Caribbean food so I am a little more critical when I'm buying from restaurants. For the fish meal this is my first choice in Caribbean restaurants but I've not enjoyed other items purchased here."}
{"text":"Had been hearing about this place for some time now by a lot of my peers so when my friend had the craving for chicken patties we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was vibrant when we walked in apparently we came during their lunch rush. I didn't order much cause I simply wanted yellow rice and veggies. I ordered the curry veggies and got recommended the pumpkin rice and that is a decision I will never regret. I actually enjoyed the rice more than the veggies but to be honest my absolute fav part was the staff. I took the time to speak to them while the food was being made and they had me cracking up the owner from NY was very helpful. I would probably try something different with the same rice though but I did leave with a new fav soda (mind you I don't drink soda at all) pleas everyone try the homeland soda Ting it is very good"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is GREAT! I eat here on average of once a week. The curry chicken, curry goat, ox tail, jerk chicken and curry veggies are the best I have ever had. You taste great flavor with each fork or spoon full. I have lived in south FL and been to Jamaica and this is the best island food I have ever enjoyed!!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and fresh.  Good first visit.  Pumpkin rice is great. Stew chicken was great. Mac and cheese not bad.  And ox tails was good, very little fat in them."}
{"text":"The best Jamaican food I've ever had.  EVERY SINGLE TIME!  I always get the jerked snapper or oxtail.  Not to mention, their signature homemade drinks.  The owner OMAR is awesome!"}
{"text":"I just love this place!! Food is GREAT!! Yes it's a long wait for your food BUT AT LEAST YOUR FOOD FRESH AND HOT!' Great flavor. LOVE THE HOMEMADE JUICE (today I tired the carrot juice which I like better then the fruit punch), they are sweet if you don't like really sweet juice you might not like them(I LOVE SWEET JUICE). The only down side is that my husband don't order from here as often as I do because he alway want to get the pepper steak or the beef stew but they never have it. Maybe they will soon"}
{"text":"So I went to this place to meet with my daughter and her mentor. It's located near the speedway on North Tryon. It's a clean Caribbean spot owned by and run by Quidley, himself!  I can say that it is the most flavorful and well seasoned Caribbean food that I have had here in Charlotte. I had the ox tails and butter cream shrimp with cabbage and pumpkin rice. No it's it a while to prepare it was definitely worth the wait. So when you come be prepared to engage in some good old-fashioned conversation with your date. Casual and clean."}
{"text":"Ok... WHY DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TELL ME ABOUT THIS PLACE ???! Omg ??!! Best jerk in Charlotte! Let's argue.. The curry is wonderful & THANK GOD they keep huge potatoes & carrots in it. Their cabbage is purple w/ onions & veggie goodness I have never had in this country! Hallelujah. The owner/chef (couldn't tell which) is charming as ever! Gave me a ginger beer on the house! Maybe you should call ahead to determine how busy they are since it was pretty steady when I went but I got my food in less than 15 mins!!"}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food I've had in Charlotte. And the lemonade....!!! I had the Jerk chicken with cabbage, pumpkin rice, and a side of plantains. The cabbage wasn't what I was expecting; however, it was delicious! The pumpkin rice was new for me and I was not disappointed. I couldn't even tell you what it tasted like. The plantains were on the small side but they were good. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"We did a takeaway on a Sunday for lunch and was very unimpressed. They did not have the curry or the fried chicken that was listed on their online menu. Left with not many choices we ordered the chicken stew was just ok. The jerk chicken felt like was made with ketchup-just too sweet for our liking. The rice and beans too was just mushy and lacked any taste. Felt stale almost. Safe to say that we will not be going back again."}
{"text":"The BEST and most authentic Jamaican food around! The couple who own Quidley's are very nice....the husband is the chef and will come out to ask how the meal is. ALWAYS amazing! There are times when I'll eat at Quidley's 2-3 times a week! Yes, the food is that good! I recommend the Oxtails and/or the Curry Chicken....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ya'll!!!! This spot is amazing! They are generous with the portions and it's tasty. Jerk Chicken and Oxtails that fall off the bone! I have the other half hooked! We wanted Caribbean and we got it. The restaurant is clean and food is prepared in eye sight. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to give Quidley's 5 stars, but I couldn't do it after the experience I just had. Two days ago I came here for the first time and ordered jerk chicken, and was told they were completely out as it is a very popular item. I completely understood, and I instead ordered the curry chicken with plantains and rice with beans. It was very good! I was still craving the jerk chicken, though, especially after seeing how popular it is.   Today, at around 12:30 PM, I called the restaurant to make sure they had jerk chicken before I went up there. A man answered the phone and told me it would be ready by 1:30 PM. I walked into Quidley's a little after 1:30, and I ordered the jerk chicken to go. The woman at the counter who I talked to said it would take about 15 minutes before it was ready, and I was fine with that. Almost 60 minutes later and seeing people who came after me get their food before me (one of which was jerk chicken), the woman I ordered from came over to me and said the chicken wasn't ready, the chef left, and that he wouldn't be back for another 20 minutes. I really contemplated leaving, but I had already waited close to an hour and didn't want it to be for nothing.   Another probably 10 minutes goes by, and she comes back up to me and asks if I want to order anything else. I told her I really wanted the jerk chicken, and that I've already waited over an hour and might as well leave with what I went there for. She continued to say she had no idea when the chef would be back and the chicken was on the grill, but they did not know when it would be ready.   After a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes, another woman comes over to me, asks if I ordered the jerk chicken, and tells me she will go ahead and get it for me. Now I'm not sure if it was ready the whole time or not, but I just don't understand why the chicken was all of a sudden ready when the chef still wasn't back, and why \"it'll be ready in 15 minutes\" turned into an hour and 15 minutes! People who came in after me were receiving their food way before me, and it looked to be that one of the regular customers was served jerk chicken after I was told it wasn't ready and way before I got mine. Were they trying to save the jerk chicken for their regular customers? It just doesn't make sense to me.   I work in a restaurant, and I have given people who have waited way less than I did their meal for free. The woman only gave me $1 off of my food! I looked at the clock went I left and it was 2:49 PM. I walked in initially around 1:34 PM. I wasn't given an apology or anything. Luckily the chicken was good, and I would've given 5 stars, but the extremely slow service and weird explanation I was given for the chicken that \"wasn't ready\" really turned me off. I really wish they would've provided better customer service and at least apologized for my ridiculous wait and asked me how they could make it right. I guess $1 off sufficed for them. Not sure if I'll be returning, really wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Yoooooo. This is the best Jamaican food I have had in Charlotte next to my own and my mothers preparations . Their curry goat and oxtails are my faves. I got a glimpse of the beef soup and started drooling! I almost added it to my order. On top of the delicious cuisine, the owners and staff are a wonderful set of people. Very nice and always hold good conversations with us when we go. They have been added to my rotation when I don't feel like cooking and want some good for the soul food. The pricing may feel a bit steep but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Best oxtail in I've had in a while, it was melting off the bone. The staff were very friendly, and the food was ready much sooner than I expected. The I got the combo and have enough to feed me for a whole. All in all, I'm pretty glad I found this place and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So I went here today because my sister, Yo has been raving about the beans and rice.....was disappointed that they were out of it today but I ordered ox tails, cabbage, and curry chicken....EXCELLENT food....Establishment is 1st class....Blessings to your business Quidley's!!!!!....keep doing what you all do.  Joy S."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting Quidley's based on a co- workers recommendation and Was IMPRESSED!! I'm from the Bronx and the oxtails with rice and peas reminded me of a true Jamaican eatery back home. The rice and peas were moist, the oxtails were tender and seasoned well, a little more fatty than I would have liked but tasty. My significant other had the curry chicken and said it was \"buttery\" soft. Kudos to Chef Omar, who was pleasant and humble. This is one of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Best authentic Jamaican food I have ever tasted! Food was extremely delicious and this place is really clean. Chef and waitresses were really nice! Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent carribean food the oxtail is hands down one of the best things on the menu. I've tried multiple places and this is by far the best. If you're looking for some carribean or even just something new you need to stop here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll begin by stating my reason for not giving them the full 5 star review. The floors were dangerously slippery.   Ok now that we've covered the only negative from our experience I'd like to describe how amazingly delicious our food was. The customer service is outstanding and they greet you as soon as you set foot in the restaurant. The aromas will smack you in the face the moment you walk in and you'll notice the hard working chef juggling phone calls and tasting his food assuring it's just right!    I ordered the small Curry Chicken and it was PERFECT! Not overpowering and tender and flavorful! The potatoes and carrots were so good that I wish I had ordered the large portion.   The Ox Tail has nothing to be envious of as it was EXCELLENT! The presentation is beautiful and the quality of food is evident after your very first bite.   The Chef will check on you to make sure you're enjoying the meal which is an indication of how focused they are with satisfying their customers.   Without a doubt I will return and recommend to anyone craving some authentic, delicious, affordable Jamaican food."}
{"text":"Very tasty but expensive for the two meat options and you don't t receive much of either of the meats to justify the significant added cost. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"My Quidleys Delight experience was great to say the least. I was greeted warmly as I walked in and sat down. The service was top notch. I had the curry shrimp and cabbage. The flavor was great and the combination of cabbages, peppers and carrots were light but filling."}
{"text":"Amazing carribean food. Everything was fresh and cooked to order. Would definitely recommend it to Carribean food enthusiasts."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews prior to going, as they didn't have some of the entrees or sides available when we got there. The staff was nice but not the best customer service. We weren't greeted or seated upon arriving and the service was a bit slow, this kept me from giving 5 stars.  I ordered the brown stew chicken with rice & peas. The plantains and cabbage were the only sides available. I also ordered a beef patty and a ginger beer. The food was amazing and had great flavor!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I recommend the fried snapper. My husband had the curry chicken and he really enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 4 stars but the wait and lack of good timing really brought our experience down. Great food, we had the curry chicken and shrimp with rice and peas and plantains. However we waited an hour for our food and were never asked about drink refills. We had a 5 year old with us and his mac and cheese was served 5 minutes after the rest of the table and was too hot to eat for 15 min. Again, good food. They need to work on timing and kitchen speed. Also they could use some shades on the windows as the lunch time sun was baking us through out the meal."}
{"text":"I have never had Caribbean food until eating here and I have been missing out. They have a very relaxed environment and I felt the love through the food."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever eaten in my life. The curry chicken was so tender, I could cut it with my fork, and the stir fry cabbage was flavorful, but still retained its crunch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been on the hunt for good Caribbean and while it wasn't the best it wasn't the worst.  I would give it a four because the flavor of my curry goat was delicious BUUUT the cut of goat used was tooooo boney!!! At one point the bone stuck my gum - NOT FUN!    The oxtails my hubby ordered we great in taste but not the meatiest I've seen!!!!   The owner was friendly and accommodating!   The waitress was efficient but not much of a personality but it was an hour before closing and she may have been tired!     This place is small but has done in seating and dies a ton of carryout!"}
{"text":"This is probably my best Caribbean place in Charlotte. The service was slow but the food was worth the wait. My four year old granddaughter said it was the best chicken she had,  to bad we was eating fried salmon, that was season just right. I'm from New York, and a very picky eater and been looking for good places to eat and Quidleys you get a thumbs up."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we weren't expecting much but their presentation was awesome. The service was great and everyone was so hospitable. The food was fresh and so delicious. We had the jerk chicken which was very moist and had the right amount of heat. My son had the oxtails and they were tender and very flavorful. Our guest had the jerk shrimp and it was delicious. We also had their freshly made lemonade to drink and it was refreshing. We definitely will go back to try other food."}
{"text":"I went with the curry chicken and plantain.  Its a Jamaican style curry for my aficionados.  It was happy with mt meal and will be sure to return the next time I'm in n town."}
{"text":"New restaurant so not too busy as we drove by.   I haven't had many Jamaican dishes.  The few I've had I've enjoyed.  Small menu (pictures added) and waitress advised every thing made fresh. Chef makes all his sauces so I was intrigued and happy thinking of foodie delights.   I did fail to even think of taking pics of our food. It was presented appealingly.   Husband ordered jerk chicken with rice and beans (they called it peas, but if so they are black eyed peas), stewed cabbage (4 or 6 other veggies- colorful and tasty!). My dish was the BBQ chicken with pumpkins rice and fried plantains.   Every thing was seasoned beautifully. The only complaint is the bone pieces that came from the broken bone pieces.  Now I get it. Cooking on the bones gives it so much flavor and keeps it moist. And sucking the marrow is a delicacy in many cultures including my southern one. I'm just not a fan - personal preference.   One dish you have to try is the potato salad. I'm not even a fan and this side has me ordering an extra.  So good!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The only negative is that I don't live in the area, making it hard to come back!  We had 2 of the combo plates and portions were very generous."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food was Awesome and the staff was very friendly! I love Jerk Chicken and the Jerk Chicken here is FIRE  ....they have a customer for life"}
{"text":"I had to take off 2 stars. Though the food is good, the service is not worth it. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a carry out order of food that's pretty much sitting in a warming tray. The staff always seems overwhelmed. They don't know how to handle a lot of customers or multiple orders. Tries to call ahead but no one was picking up the phone. Walked in and saw pure chaos behind the counter. Smh. Also this place is unreliable. I have been here twice before and it was closed. No note on the door.  Lights off, chairs on  the table. The website stated they were opened but I wasted a trip, twice."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time tonight and I'm trying to find a way to come back this week. I was in Grand Caymen over the summer and the food is spot on with all the delicious meals I had then. I came with the kids, very kid friendly place, wait staff was excellent and engaged the kids. I got the jerk chicken, my wife the tofu curry, and the kids for 2 different kinda of shims- all fantastic. Well worth stopping in if you get the chance"}
{"text":"Staying nearby on business and came in for lunch due to the great yelp reviews. Very glad I did! I am not a frequent visitor to Jamaican restaurants but this is by far the tastiest Jamaican food I've had. Looks to be a family run joint. The service is friendly and quick. Food was awesome- had the combo with curry chicken, oxtail, cabbage, plantains, and pumpkin rice. Everything was delicious and I was stuffed! Definitely recommend if you're nearby- very close to the motor speedway."}
{"text":"Loved the shrimp! The plantains were good (but not sweet). The pumpkin rice is unusual and slightly sweet. The presentation on the plate was beautiful and the server really kind. Love the music!!"}
{"text":"Went 2 times in 2 weeks with friends and we all got salty food... This is definitely not a place for authentic Caribbean food. Owners/operators may be from an island but the cooking dose not represent that type of cooking. #Saltynospice"}
{"text":"Such friendly staff, clean place and amazing food! I got the fried Tilapia, with cabbage, rice and of course, plantains.  Did not disappoint.  The lemonade is also made in-house and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"They say you eat with your eyes first. In that spirit, let me first describe the wonderful dish that was placed before me on a white rectangular plate. First, to the left was a glorious scoop of pumpkin rice in a lovey shade of, you guessed it, pumpkin. In the middle of the plate, were 4-5 pieces of bone in chicken with a silky jerk sauce. To the right, was the multi-colored fried cabbage.  Now for the taste of the meal! The pumpkin was lightly seasoned and not sweet. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie and my first thought was that it might taste like rice pumpkin pie. Not so. This was a lovely, lightly seasoned fluffy rice. It was incredible. Next, were the pieces of chicken and as expected,  because they were bone-in, were perfectly juicy. The jerk sauce , as I call it, was sweet but not too sweet and then it had a great little bite at the end but not too hot. It was perfect. Perfectly cooked and juicy. The stir fry cabbage was perfectly cooked not soggy still with a slight crunch and lightly seasoned. The colorful presentation of the white and purple cabbage along carrots, yellow, red and green peppers were colorful as well as flavorful!  All the food on the plate went together very well flavor wise. They were perfectly seasoned. Not too much salt, not too much seasoning and not too much heat. For me it was perfect. I will be back. I would highly recommend trying to Flavors of this restaurant. As we sat waiting for our meal the smells waffling through the restaurant were incredible. I knew instantly when they put a piece of fish on the grill because it smelled like fish was supposed to smell like, Fresh! It was glorious.  This leads me to my last comment and that is about the staff. They were wonderful. Great big smiles on their faces even when I could tell they were very, very busy. I had a great conversation with the guy at the register about the fish I mentioned earlier. I said I knew it was good fish when it's smelled like fish is  supposed to smell like and as I stated before, fresh. That fishy smell that people come to expect with fish means the fish is not good. This smells like the fish that I had grown up catching in the Chesapeake Bay and cooking up that night. Fresh, fresh, fresh. So, back to the staff they were wonderful. Thank you for a good experience!"}
{"text":"Small and intimate resturant in University area.  Owner and staff in hand couldn't have been nicer. Food was really good.  Some of the best and meatiest oxtails I've had.  Pumkin rice is new fave! Also tried fried snapper, wasnt as good but not bad either..fried a little to long-but there was a rush of people so I forgive them. I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Rich and delicious.  We had the curry chicken and the oxtail in brown sauce, and both were excellent.  Don't miss the sorrel (hibiscus) and the fruit punch to drink."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab dinner before a movie and thought we would try something new. Quidley's is on the corner of a stop mall, which gave us pause. But oh my, we were pleasantly surprised by what we found inside!  Not only is the staff super friendly but the food is fantastic! Cooked to order not thawed and heated like so many other places.  About halfway though our visit the chef, whom you can see as it is an open kitchen concept, cranked the Jamaican music and danced his way through preparing meals.  We will certainly be back for more excellent food and Jamaican hospitality."}
{"text":"We were driving around the university area looking for something to eat and stumbled across this place while on Yelp.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by the friendly staff.    We ordered the oxtail and jerk chicken, pumpkin rice, potato salad, and plantains.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The meat was falling off the bones.  Their portions appeared to be small at first but after we finished eating, we both agreed it was the perfect amount.  The only negative thing I could possibly say is that it was rather warm in there but it wasn't unbearable by any means.  Although I'm hardly in the university area, I would say it's definitely worth the drive.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best jerk chicken in charlotte. I love all the dishes here. The pumpkin rice is really good so I definitely recommend it. The only problem I have is their opening times can be inconsistent but that's okay. The food is still really good."}
{"text":"We ate here Sat. night with some friends.  It is in the strip mall where my children used to take Tae Kwon Do lessons (shout out to Black Belt USA!!)  The staff was a little over-whelmed by the crowd on Sat. night, but they were super nice and we were not in a hurry so we said no worries!  The food was worth the wait!  We had the curry shrimp with pumpkin rice, cabbage and plantains with the fried okra app.  Our friends had the curry chicken.  Everyone loved their food!  Good size portions, beautifully presented, full of flavor.  You can tell that they use super fresh ingredients.  The owner even stopped by our table to introduced himself.  He explained where he was from in Jamaica and was so friendly.  You can tell they everyone there really cares about the food and making customers happy.  We highly recommend Quidley's!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Didn't have Mac and cheese or plantains but overall the food was good! Would recommend that you call to see what sides they have ready before you go!"}
{"text":"Food was Super Authentic and Delicious! Best Oxtail I've had since I moved here from NJ! The cabbage was super fresh with great flavor.  The staff was very nice and welcoming...and the restaurant was very clean which is always a bonus!  We will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Quidleys Delight for lunch today after a co-workers recommendation.  The food was delicious!  I had the jerk shrimp with peas and rice, cabbage and plantains.  The jerk sauce was very flavorful. I was looking forward to trying the pumpkin rice, but they were out.  I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after dropping my daughter off at the movie theater nearby.  I ordered the Curry Chicken and it was fabulous!  The sauce was flavorful, but not spicy at all (there's Scotch Bonnet sauce at the table to ramp things up if you want.)  It is probably in the top 15 chicken dishes that I have ever had; but the chicken itself was probably the best I have ever had.  Deboned.  Juicy. Cut with a fork tender.  The staff were very nice; having fun with themselves and their customers.  Very pleasant lunch.  Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This is the best Caribbean restaurant I have experienced in Charlotte!! The food is amazing! You can tell that fresh spices are used to prepare everything. For me presentation is a PLUS! The presentation even in a togo plate is awesome. I've had the ox tails and the jerk chicken! Both were tender and falling off of the bone! For sides I have experienced the cabbage, which is beautiful by the way. The fresh pepper and colorful red cabbage are a pleasant sight. I've also had the yams and the plantains. Both of which were delightful. This place is great all thumbs up to a job well done. Not to mention the price! It's great everyone in charlotte or passing though the university area needs to try Quidleys!!"}
{"text":"Food was great - good flavors and not too spicy - had fried coconut shrimp for appetizer and butter shrimp with yams and pumpkin rice for our main meal. Was more expensive that I thought it would be for one appetizer and one meal - $26"}
{"text":"Tried this because of Yelp reviews. Was a great experience - service, food, and price were all on point. Highly recommend the jerk chicken and the jerk shrimp."}
