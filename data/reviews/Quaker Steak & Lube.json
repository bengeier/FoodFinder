{"text":"Eh. Stopped in for lunch and got the buffet. Food was ok. Not horrible, not great. The salad portion of the bar was typical salad bar. There is pasta and one kind of wing available on the buffet but you can order any kind of wings in as small as 4 wings and its included so that made up for it. I ordered 4 mango dry rub and, while a little salty, they were pretty fantastic. 

We came in at noon, got seated right away, and service was great. As long as you come in knowing that it's a QSL and not French dining you'll be OK. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fries were soggy and pulled pork sandwich was too salty. Server didn't stop by very often. Bathroom paper towel dispensers were empty."}
{"text":"Tourist Trap...

My family was staying nextdoor at a hotel during a vacation and we wandered over to this restaurant since they didn't have a wait like the chains down the road (now I know why...). The food was dense fried bar food, and the chicken \"wings\" were more like square nuggets - kinda grossed me out as a vegetarian. I ended up with subpar french fries for dinner. The only good thing was that they gave us Twizzlers instead of after-dinner mints. I wouldn't go back here, and would recommend going somewhere else for wings if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several of these before using yelp. The food is good and seasoned well and the portions are average for the cost. Our waitress on the other hand could have been better. Friendly but slow. As the restaurant was not busy but our food took 45 minutes for burgers and meatball sub. We watched others around get served while we waited."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in the United States. I have also had the burgers here and they are also delicious but the chicken wings are the hilight of this place. There are tons of different sauce choices to chose from to extremely hot to mild. This place has great food for the entire family. The bar is also perfect this place has plenty of tap beer to chose from and also plenty of mixed drinks.  I recommend trying the leaded lube n aid this drink  contains lemonade and vodka. This place is no doubt a 5 star place. I have been here many times. Just miss Brenda our favorite waitress."}
{"text":"We were in the area from Oregon for a Pirates game. After driving by here several times during the week we finally stopped for desert on our last night in town. We loved it!! We wished we would have stopped earlier for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer here and highly recommend the service, wings and beer. Wings are a staple and always good. I would also recommend the lube burger or any burger for that matter. Football Sunday's are fun and there is always a good crowd."}
{"text":"The burger and fry's were good. Service was good and staff was friendly and helpful. They might have some of the worlds largest curly straws lol. Overall good experience and lots to look at in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was good and fast. The chicken wings were slightly uncooked though. I would possibly go again but the wings need to be cooked longer.  I like my wings to be slightly crispy with the sauce on them.  The atmosphere was good and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Nothing overly special, but the food is decent. I've had better wings elsewhere, but then I'm not a fan of the super-hot stuff: and that seems to be the specialty here. They have wings so hot you have to sign a waiver to eat them. My husband enjoys that sort of thing, so that's why we've come to this place a few times.

If you aren't in it for the hot wings, chances are you won't be terribly thrilled by this place either. The flavors I've tried have been mediocre, but they prepare them well and the sides/soups are good. Plus there's plenty of interesting stuff to look at if you're a racing fan."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best quaker steak & lube..i love the staff..the food..and the atmosphere. I always come here for there wings ...loaded magna fries and you have go to try their Lube chips & beer cheese sauce. If i could live eating quaker everday i would lol!!!"}
{"text":"My oh my! I just love their wings. Their spicy sauces are awesome. My kids love getting their food in the car box. they love to take them home to play. It's a little crowded inside and can be loud sometimes. I love the fact that the decor inside has a different feel than other place. The wait time is a bit long but it's all wroth the wait when the wings arrive."}
{"text":"Always love Quaker!! You know what you're going to get experience wise. Our server Angie was awesome."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and it used to be great but this place is really going down hill. As another reviewer stated, they nickel and dime you for everything. I ordered the combo meal with hot wings and when I asked for celery the waitress said \"those don't come with the combo meals and will be $2.99 extra.\" Really? For 5 celery sticks? My fiance ordered the ranch wings and they came out plain with what appeared to be a dry seasoning. They apologized for the mixup and brought him ranch wings but only one drumstick in the entire batch. It is disappointing because going here used to be a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Best wing sauce in town good service good atmosphere good times. The wing Buffet is a good value. I love calling ahead and picking up at the drive thru window.  There is also free air for your tires in the back. I guess you don't have to worry about getting a flat while you eat."}
{"text":"My steak sandwich for lunch today was delicious.  My server Holly may be in the wrong business.  I was her only customer and she could have care less about being nice.  Holly pick another career."}
{"text":"Closed!!! Went there and it is padlocked with security guards ,so sad!where will bike night be held at now?"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple: If you want great food that's not frozen, thoroughly cooked and at your table in under 30 minutes: don't eat here. If you want to stare at the wall or a bunch of replicated NASCAR junk: you should come here because there's something wrong with you. 

Save your money. Burger King is cheaper."}
{"text":"When we come here, we sit at the bar. The service is good there, their bar stools are super comfy and I hate their plastic chairs. Natalie was our bartender today. We've been here many times but this was our first time with her working. She was witty and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect when walking into a gas station-turned-restaurant kinda place.  A fun and very different atmosphere, that's for sure!  

We got the Lube Burger with a side of cinnamon baked apples, their new Cheesesteak O-Ring feature with homemade chips, and an appetizer of their hot wings since that's obviously what this joint is known for.  All was wonderfully satisfying but the Lube Burger was really something special.  One of the tastiest burgers I've had yet.  An award-winner, according to their menu, and did not disappoint!  To top it off, fabulous service from Julia.  A great selection of sauces on display that we chose a few samples.  Would love to go back and try more of their burgers and different flavored wings.  A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Any chain restaurant in Lakewood that targets twenty- to forty-something diners (as opposed to seniors, or families with kids) is facing an uphill battle these days.  There are simply too many great non-chain options available.  I'm also not sure how many people in the Lakewood area are really that much into NASCAR to enjoy the cars, cars and more cars theme of the restaurant.

Nevertheless, we gave QSL a try once having heard raves about it in other locations. It has a good location in a strip mall in downtown Lakewood - lots of free parking in the back, and a strip storefront suits this kind of joint whereas a fancier or more unusual restaurant concept might not fit in.  

The food was OK but overpriced.  The servers seemed to be really young, pleasant enough, but on the s-l-o-w side especially since most of the tables were empty.  The portions and even the dishes, glasses and cups tend to be super-sized, which made them a bit hard to handle.  

I guess this is all right if you are really into NASCAR, like QSL's brand of wings, or feel a need to have a chain mall dining experience without leaving the 'Wood.  I didn't see or taste anything that would make me come rushing back, especially in view of the prices for pretty ordinary food."}
{"text":"Great time at quaker steak and lube , great service , wonderful atmosphere , and a fun place to bring the family . Try their dipping chicken with any of the wonderful lube sauces it's to die for ! ! ! !"}
{"text":"We're here in Middleton for Epic training and one of the guys in our group grew up near here so of course he wanted to take us to Quaker Steak and Lube.

 Having been moderately disappointed with the last few times I've ordered \"hot\" wings I was intrigued when I saw that they claimed the best wings and also had a triple atomic challenge. I was a bit suprised at the cost to attempt the challenge (13.99 for three wings and a t-shirt if you succeed) so I opted to just order their all you can eat special and maybe get a few towards the end to see what they were like. So after a few orders of variously spicy wings I ended up at the level just below the atomic. At that point we had a bit of debate at the table which ended up with my skipping the atomic and going right to triple atomic.

 The waitperson let me know that there was an additional charge which was fine and he provided me with a waiver to sign. With the \"legal\" formalities out of they way they brought out my last order of wings with the triple atomic sauce, and  they even threw in a bonus wing! With a small amount of trepidation, I sniffed the sauce for the telltale chemical odor of capsaicin extract which can give you some pretty nasty chemical burns. It seemed to be ok so while everyone stared, I dug in, carefully avoiding my lips. Finished the first and waited a bit for it to sink in... not bad! Good slow build on the burn and a LOT of complex flavors. It was apparent that whomever developed the recipe was a spicy food lover as well. I finished the rest of the wings and settled back to enjoy the endorphin rush. 

I even got a little bit in a togo cup for a fellow chili head back home. Wonder what TSA will have to say about that? Hope no drug sniffing dogs are injured in the the process.

So thanks to the staff at the Middleton Quaker Steak and Lube for warming up this guy on a cold January night. My daughter is super excited to get the t-shirt."}
{"text":"Excellent food I ordered wings and salad . Wings crust and moist. The salad was fresh with dark greens excellent .i would recommend this restaurant. The drinks are well priced and well made"}
{"text":"Second attempt at carry out. First attempt half of the order was not bagged. This time using the apology gift card plus 40.00 was the last. Wings were dry. Hardly any sauce. Fish sandwich was fish on a bun. No lettuce. No tartar. Appetizer sampler included pretzels that we could not bite or chew. We are done."}
{"text":"I really want to dislike this place since their food all seems to be different sculptures based around solidified grease, but I'll be dipped if I don't find myself back here all the time.  They actually have a huge menu for a bar, OK beer prices and a great, friendly staff.  Of course I got the fried platter with onion rings, cheese sticks and fried pickles; I guess I'll have to make peace and call this a great guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I've written a review before on this location, and it was very positive.  Frankly, today's isn't.  I decided to take tomorrow off, which for me at least, means I enjoy my night BEFORE more than the actual day off.  Short story, I got home from work, showered, and decided to go for a couple  of beers on the ;patio at this location and bring dinner home.  It's HOT, and it was refreshing to be in the open air and enjoyed my beer.  When the young lady approached me, or to put it another way, initiated contact with me while I was on the bar stool and she was the bartender, I told her I'll have a \"couple of beers and something to go\".  She brought me my beer and went away.  That was it.  It was NOT busy, relatively speaking form experience having worked in the restaurant and bar industry in New York years ago.  I'm NOT kidding.  She ignored me,  I finished my beer, fiddled, looked around, fiddled some more, played on my phone, fiddled, played and well, you get it.  I gave up on the thought of a second beer and totally gave up on the notion of a bucket of wings when I finally caught her eye only to have her give me the \"index finger hold on\" while hustling to take care of someone who had just sauntered up to the bar.  Never mind me who's been here forty five minutes.  Long story short, when she FINALLY looked my way, I said I just want to settle up and get out of here.  She nodded and ignored me five more minutes.  Finally, having no change, and knowing I owed seven dollars and two cents for the draft beer (YES, REALLY) I turned to the nice Harley guys next to me, explained my plight in a few seconds and the one guy said \"yea, the service sucks here\" and gave me change so I could pay and leave.  I called the manager on the way home, something I very rarely do, and talked to a guy named Mike, who was cool, but what could he do?  I don't want anything.  No free stuff.  I just wanted him to know he and his business missed out on another fifty or so dollars because he has either inattentive people working the bar or inept ones.  I left hungry, and frankly pissed off.  Mike tried to make it better, to his credit, but I wasn't interested at that point.  Bottom line; when you run a business, have people who are capable of providing for the customer, not some eighteen or twenty year old kid trying to keep up.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is always a good time, and the food is delicious. I've been there for the all-you-can-eat wings as well as other food. Definitely a spot worth checking out if you like sports bars and 'bar food'."}
{"text":"We were here after 11pm on a Thursday, which is Karaoke night. That was pretty bad, but is was made so much worse by how loud it was in the restaurant. The noise was very nearly unbearable. 

More importantly, the food was terrible. We ordered nachos, onion rings, and pretzels for our table. The nachos were completely tasteless. The corn they throw on top of the chips says it's fire-grilled on the menu, but it's just out of a can. There's no real cheese on the dish and the queso they use instead is pretty boring. The pretzels and the onion rings were acceptable except for the sauces that came with them. The cheese sauce that came with the pretzels was different from the cheese sauce on the nachos. It had a disgusting skin on it when it got to the table, it was a yucky, goop-y consistency, and it wasn't very good. I don't remember what they called the sauce that came with the onion rings - something tomato based. We just dipped the rings in ketchup instead.

Service wasn't bad for the time of night. I would never go back."}
{"text":"This was my family and my first visit to a Steak & Lube.  It was ok.  The food was good, but it was the service that was terribly slow.  We had to wait a good while before our waitress even came to our table.  She brought out our drinks quickly, but after that she took off to other tables and to sing a lot of happy birthday songs -there seemed to be a lot of birthdays that day, what are the odds of that happening again?.  Finally when we got to order our food, it took just a little while longer before we got to eat our meals.  On another note, I did like their root beer a lot!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place stays open! I have been to the Lakewood location three times, two times it was dead service was ok. The other visit it was slammed and service was bad . 
The food is unbelievably bad!!! Wings are soggy or tuff, and overall horrible. On top of everything, the food is way over priced ! I will never go here for anything again. 

If I could give this a honest rating, I would give it 1/2 star because of a nice patio."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout just drive up.  Love their fish and wings.  Everything is so fresh. Service was wonderful"}
{"text":"I have given this place several chances but this place just disappoints. Walked out one time because we waited over 10 mins after seated before a server every spoked to us. Food is mediocre at best. Last visit took the cake. The bathroom was beyond filthy."}
{"text":"If you want to pay a premium for poorly prepared bar food just because they have allot of nascar related crap hanging on the walls...then go here.  

Overpriced.  Slow but pleasant service.  Tacky overdone theme.  
Better bar food at dozens of places in Lakewood.  No reason to go here."}
{"text":"Ate there once a long while ago and won't go back. The food tasted like it had sat under a heat lamp for the entire day. Maybe even the previous day too. Even McD's has gotten away from that. Plus not that much for what we paid. No thanks. Should admit I'm more a legs guy and not so much for the wings. I don't think anyone in our party ordered wings either so maybe that's why I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We went on their unlimited wing night. Fast service wing refills came out very quickly and it was a full restaurant. Had over 20 different sauces for their wings to choose from. Staff was friendly. Our server was excellent very attentive and friendly. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times and ordered wings each time. Once they were cooked perfectly. The other two times I was served undercooked wings (gummy skins, no crispness).  I wish they were more consistent with their cooking because I do like their sauces."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  It used to be much better.  Buffet for lunch is a good value.  Bar is not.  Kid friendly and they occasionally have events themed for families."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and they weren't busy at all. After receiving food it looked like it was sitting under a hot lamp for 10 minutes.  Waitress was friendly but I waited awhile for refills and a checkup. I now understand why I am seeing some of these places go out of business"}
{"text":"Save you money!

I guess I should have gotten the wings?!? Ended up getting burgers... Big mistake!! Unseasoned and dripping in grease.."}
{"text":"I will not be going back! This was my 2nd time there...the service was slow, it was biker night & the waitress said since biker night was slow they were having a meeting in the kitchen, at 6p.m.! My father's 1st steak was over cooked, they got him another and the quality of the steak was very very poor.  I got boneless wings and they were not good...I think they must have put the sauce on before frying them? They were like little chicken nuggets. I had to wait to eat them b/c my ranch wasn't brought out with them nor was my celery & carrots.  My father ordered an appetizer of homemade wings which came out with the meal, not an appetizer and was only a very small portion(for one person) and were over fried I guess, they were too hard to chew.  My daughter got a grilled chicken tender kids meal.  The thicker portion of the chicken was on the edge of needing to be cooked a few more minutes so I cut that part off. The amount of fries was very small, which is ok for a 3 year old, but most places give a larger portion, which is what I was expecting so had planned on sharing them with her.  Luckily we did speak to the manager and she comped some of the food and offered coupons, but we told her we would never be back! I do not recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Every time I fly into or out of CLE Hopkins, I make sure I get wings from here. They are truly amazing"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a beer and sit outside on a patio along Detroit. Most if the patios in Lakewood are tucked behind the bar and not welcoming at all. 
Bartender Matt is all over it! Professional, outgoing and makes it a point to know everyone's name at his bar. Food is decent, typical bar food you can find anywhere."}
{"text":"From the menus with pages that were were stuck together--to the really blah and small hamburger, we won't go back.  Drinks were meek and expensive, french fries were coated and salty--typical Sysco food.  
With so many great places to eat in Lakewood, don't waste your time at this chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Quaker has two indoor bars, an outdoor bar/patio, and a huge dining room.  The wings have many unique flavors such as Dusted Wasabi Ginger.  My boyfriend's ultimate favorite is Mustang Chicken, a grilled chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, cheese and bacon.  They also have neon bendy straws in the drinks!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here every once in a while, but it always fails.  Today the food was ok, but the service was awful,  horrible! !  We waited for ever for our food!
My husband and I didn't get to order our second round of drinks till  we stopped a different server, about 25 mins later.  Our server had an attitude problem,  she hates her job. She was rude. When our server ( Abby) brought out our food, she didnt take our dirty dishes away. We had some wings and no napkins! 
What an awful experience. 
My family and I wont be coming back ever!!"}
{"text":"That's exactly what Lakewood needs, another wings, burgers and beer joint! Oh well. I'm happy that Quaker Steak is finally open. We had the boneless wings and tried the Thai R Cracker BBQ sauce and the Dry Chipotle BBQ rub too. Both were good. Service was fine and our server was friendly. The cars theme decor is a bit crazy. Very family friendly since there were lots of kids too. I was hoping to sit outside but didn't realize they allowed smoking on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is so lame.The wife and me went here last night for bike night.What a joke .Only five bike came.No specials for bikers.No nothing.This by far the worst Quaker Steak around.Dont no how todo a bike night.The chain should close this place.If you want a real bike night go to. Sheffield Lake or Valley View. Ride on"}
{"text":"I've been to this Quaker a few times. Every time I've been disappointed with the food and service. I brought a girl with me who just happened to like avocado an unusual amount. She ordered a sandwich with avocado, turns out they were out of avocado and didn't tell anyone. I had to ask. 

To be a little more on the shallow side, the beer specials weren't that great and the wait staff could have been more attractive. 

Definitely never going back especially with the Carolina Ale house right down the road."}
{"text":"don't bother with the drive-thru. they're the shunned, wanna be waitstaff. they're outdoor menu hasn't been updated with prices in months and this was confirmed by the person taking my order, as well as the manager and assistant manager. they also stated that to go portions are \"much smaller\" but cost the same when ordering in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The wings are completely superior to BW3.  The atomic wings are grossly hot.  Not sure how anyone eats them.  The rest of the wing menu has great variety and is full of taste.  My biggest knock on them after multiple visits is the service.  I have had experiences with poor wait staff as well as a poorly handled situation by the manager on duty."}
{"text":"We went here for my dad's birthday, which is the only reason I would eat here because I'm vegetarian. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, though this is definitely NOT the place for a vegetarian. The only non-meaty dish they have other than appetizers is their house salad. My mom got one with her meal and frankly, it looked pretty bland (and she didn't really care for it). 
We got the fried pickles for an appetizer, which were tasty. For my \"meal,\" I ordered the \"Bavarian\" pretzels--which were just the frozen pretzels you can buy at the store and microwave at home, but smothered in butter. I also ordered a side of their steamed green beans. They may have been steamed in order to be cooked, but they were also smothered in butter and pretty gross.
I suppose if you're into wings or burgers, this would be a good place for you. The beer of the month is only $3.75 for a 23 oz, and they have and giant 100 oz beer tube with a spout that you can get if you're up for a challenge. Hooray beer!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here today and had the chicken tenders and they are delicious tender and juicy very good. We also took the triple atomic wing challenge boy they are good. sweet with a ton of kick the challenge was to eat six of these seriously HOT wings so we did and it was fun. The staff were absolutely amazing cheering us on while Jeff the manager timed us two minutes up wings were finished let the pain begin do not attempt unless you like pain lol. Seriously though this was entirely enjoyable definitely five stars will absolutely do it again."}
{"text":"3 stars is a push but they made it right...for our party at least. Went there last night with a few friends for the WGAR summer concert series. While sitting at the bar, I had ordered a \"short\" angry orchard  (16 Oz). After we ate our food & were finishing the first round of drinks, I ordered a \"tall\" angry orchard (supposed to be 22 Oz) to last through the rest of the concert. The cups looked very similar in size but one was short & fat, the other tall & skinny. I got curious & poured my \"tall\" drink into my \"short\" glass & wouldn't you know?! They were the exact same size. I brought it to the managers attention, since I paid  $2 more for the exact same size drink. He made it right by giving me another, free AO. But I couldn't help but think of all those people that got ripped off that night! The food was good, especially compared to my other experience at Quaker Steak in Vermillion. The wait staff isn't the brightest..I asked for no cucumber on my salad & it was on there and I asked for ranch & got Bleu cheese. He fixed it."}
{"text":"Quaker S&L is busy, loud and has fairly good wings, expensive but good steaks, and trite \"motor head\" repro decor. There are better restaurants for the money."}
{"text":"The Lakewood location's bar service is the dumps! Especially when business is sloooww. My first visit was on a beautiful fall day around 3pm. I had passed the attractive storefront patio on Detroit and felt an immediate urge to check it out. I sat down as 2 guys were cashing out with the bartender. The Bartender took their check and disappeared inside without any kind of greeting whatsoever.  I walked out bc I wasn't greeted for 10-15 more min. It is not my job to announce my presence at a bar. 1st visit-1st impression was bad but I can give 'em the benefit of the doubt...On to the 2nd visit last night, 2 of us walk in, take off our coats and sit at the bar. The bartender sees this and proceeds to leave the bar to search for and pick some songs on the Touch-Tunes. After 10 minutes of not having anyone behind the bar, I had to pour my own drink of Fireball (only bottle within reach). THAT finally got their attention, yet they didn't even confront me about it; they just added it to my tab and continued with the bad service. Finally some shift leader kid told me to not do it again. I will not do that again because I can't respect a place that hasn't showed an ounce of respect for me as a customer.  Based on some other reviews but not personal experience, I'm giving them a third strike for overpriced, small portions. Way to go....NOT!  Party on Wayne"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and Quaker was right across the street from my hotel, so I decided to check it out, especially since there isn't one in Indianapolis.  For those who have never been, it's a sort of \"automobile\" themed restaurant.  It was decorated with cars hanging from the ceiling, motors, etc.  The atmosphere was very casual..  There was a small area for kids to keep busy and also more of a \"bar\" side.  The menu was somewhat broad in that you could order anything from wings to steak.  Being as I am a steak lover, I decided to order a steak, fries to go. I did not have very high hopes of a 5 star quality steak since this was a casual/sports type place.  It took awhile to get my food and by the time I got back across the street (less that a minute walk) and up to my room, the food was not very hot, which leads me to believe it wasn't very hot initially.  I know most will say that a steak should not be cooked well done, but I like my steak well done.  The steak was a bit tough and dry and the fries were a little soggy.  All in all, I didn't set high expectations of this place, but I would try it again and order something different.  It seems to be a great low cost place to take the kids or meet up for drinks & football."}
{"text":"In my expierience at this (what i thought was a good resteraunt)  today my love for this industry had died. Wing night is a no go for me. The wings were cold and the servers would bring me randomized flavors that i never even asked for. Then after a good 15 min of waiting  for what i hoped would be my last round of wings, again they sent me wings i didnt ask for and the servent will open your wet naps for you by the way which i found highly innapropriate and unsanitary. Her name is vida im pretty sure. She seemed well but her service was pretty vulgar. It pains me to say that i have no good hopes for this location, and i recommend going elsewhere for wings."}
{"text":"Just had the worst lunch experience here.  Arrived at 11:20 am and ordered the steak (medium) and the grilled shrimp with tails on.  It took 35 minutes for our food to arrive and the steak was well done.  So they put another steak on to replace the well done one. The grilled shrimp consisted of 6 very small boiled shrimp, not grilled, no tails. Received the 2nd steak, which was cooked properly, 20 minutes later.  Finished my lunch quickly as my companions were already done eating.  Then sat and waited for our waitress to bring us our checks. 20 minutes later the checks came.  Two of my party paid with cards.  The waitress came back and said that the machine was out of paper so she couldn't run the cards from her station.  She disappeared for another 20 minutes. This was a 2 hour lunch fiasco. We were told that there were only 2 people cooking at the time but we could see at least 10 or 11 people on the floor wandering around. This place will definitely go on my 'never again' list."}
{"text":"I tried QS&L for their lunch buffet and was disappointed. The place had the musty smell of beer-soaked carpet that hadn't been cleaned in a while, and the wings on the buffet had the soggy quality that comes when you put once crunch wings in a steam environment for a good long while. I've also visited during happy hour and was a bit more satisfied with the experience, at least the food and beer smells were fresher. But the wings, while competent, weren't spectacular. I've had better wings and a lower overall tab at a number of South Side establishments including Smokin' Joes, Mario's Southside Saloon and Fatheads."}
{"text":"The service provided was outstanding and the food was great! I had boneless wings that were cooked well with just the right amount of sauce. Nice place with an intriguing atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is so mediocre yet the price is not.  The service is always awful. I thought I was playing it safe by taking my food to go this time, but the take-out girl was more interested in flirting with some guy (in front of his girlfriend, too) than even acknowledging me. Definitely the last time I eat at this dump. 

P.S. They charge you $1 to split sauces.  It's not about the $1, it's an insult to the customer."}
{"text":"I love the buckeye bbq wings. They are definately one of my favorites. I have been there several times and always had a good experience. A little pricey for wings but they are good."}
{"text":"Service is good. Onion rings are very good tried a few of their new bergers are above average. The Louisiana BBQ sauce great"}
{"text":"Our waitress ( Joyce ) was great. Really went above and beyond the typical service we have had at other restaurants"}
{"text":"Can't  get an online order right. Set pick up for 2 30 pm had to wait at window 15 minutes  past time. Missing condiments  for sandwich specific requested. Smart ass .on phone when called"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here.  It is easy to find right off interstate 85.  The wings and onion rings are fantastic. My favorite thing is the Tuesday all you can eat chicken. boneless wings, traditional does not matter! Bring your appetite and don't fill up on the fries!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Rather good food, we had a good burger, A good side order of fresh soft pretzels, a good bucket of  spicy chicken wings, and a worthwhile case of indigestion.

This place is good in spite of its taken a bit too far theme. (-1 star for having way too many menu items named \"lube\" (Example, a glass of Strawberry  Lube-onade)"}
{"text":"My husband & I went here after the movies on Labor Day (9/1/14).  The hamburgers used to be great but, over the years, have become......just plain awful.  The meat was flavorless.  Possibly stale.  Dry - no juice.  Even the bacon had no flavor.  The \"lemonade\" was a cut up lemon thrown into a glass of water.  And what idiot thought that removing comfortable seating & replacing it with cheap patio chairs was a good idea?  The carpeting has been flooded so many times that it should be removed.  I get that this is a theme restaurant but having all that stuff on the walls must make it impossible to clean the food splatters off cause.......no one has.  This is another place I will never eat at again."}
{"text":"Love the lunch buffet. We come here for lunch often and the buffet is always stocked. I love that you can choose your own sauce for your wings from the buffet."}

{"text":"Unbelievably tasty food! Great customer service and unbeatable prices!

My family and I moved to West Madison in January of 2009, leaving our favorite italian restaurant behind back in our hometown. We were searching for a place to go *once a week for family night* and we found it immediately! 

Quaker Steak and Lube was recommended to my brother by a co-worker. So, one Saturday night, right before hitting up The Comedy Club on State, we decided to stop by Quaker Steak and Lube as a \"trial\". We were immediately greeted and seated with no wait. It was BUSY too. I ordered the chicken fenders and french fries with a side of ranch- they were delicious! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The fries were seasoned to perfection and the ranch... YUM. It's hard to find a place that serves really great ranch. **So far Red Robin is #1 ranch server and Quaker Steak and Lube is now #2** My fiance ordered chicken wings. They tasted baked and then deep-fried. Their choice of sauces were practically limitless. There was a ton to choose from. My brother and his wife each ordered a burger and fries and a bowl of the cheesy baked potato soup. They were both very pleased with their meal. Our bill came to about $60 which wasn't bad for the four of us. We had a great time and the place is decorated so that even if you went with someone you didn't like, you'd have plenty of things to keep yourself busy staring at.

Overall, I highly recommend Quaker Steak and Lube to anyone looking for a great meal in a fun & friendly atmosphere.

However, this is not the place to take someone to romantically gaze into each others eyes. It's quite noisy and very laid back.

I'm happy to say that our family day at Quaker Steak and Lube is every Tuesday *ALL YOU CAN EAT WING NIGHT* for $12.99 (unlimited wings, fries & soda)"}
{"text":"The staff was nice but the food was average.

My wife ordered the lube burger which had a pretty nice sauce and was a good size along with a side of boneless Fiery BBQ wings which were not spicy at all (it's in the 'yellow' so she was expecting at least a tiny hint) and too heavily breaded.

For some strange reason I had an overwhelming need to dip something in ranch (no this is not a common occurrence), specifically chicken tenders. Lo and behold when I opened up the menu they were advertising what appeared to be a revamped chicken tender. 

So away I sent the waiter with that order and a side of medium sauced buffalo wings. When the tenders came I was shocked by the teeny weeny tiny portion. It looked like a kid's meal portion so I was quite happy to have the extra wings. The quantity not withstanding, they had good flavor, were very moist as was advertised, and went well with both the Boom Boom sauce and ranch. My dunking desire was mostly satisfied.

The wings were just alright. No complaints with the meat just the medium sauce once again had NO kick whatsoever. In fact, it was pretty flavorless. If I go back I will be sure to do as Emeril Lagasse advises and 'Kick it up a notch!'."}
{"text":"Going here after Badger football games is one of my favorite things. It does get pretty busy at the time though as tons of other Badger fans have the same thing in mind. Even when they're super busy, the service is always phenomenal. 

Their boneless wings and sauces are amazing. Definitely try the Arizona Ranch - SO GOOD! Some of the other things I've ordered from here and loved are the loaded magna fries, the blackened fajita salad, and the turkey BLT wrap. I've never had anything bad from their menu."}
{"text":"Good and Bad.  I'm from out of state and have eaten here  twice while in town for Steelers games.  Both times I've ordered wings with \"hot\" sauce.  It may be the best flavor of buffalo style sauce I've ever had.  Thats where the good part of this review ends.   Both visits were on Friday nights around 7:00-8:00 and the place was not busy at all. The restaurant itself is a testament to poor management.  The entire place needs to be cleaned from top to bottom.  While sitting waiting for our order, you can't help but look at all the paraphernalia hanging from the ceiling.  It would all be great except that while looking you notice EVERYTHING is covered in about 10 years of dust including the ductwork.  The tires on the race car look like they are growing hair the dust is so thick. The men's room was filthy and in need of remodeling.  The tables both times were sticky and the carpet is worn with debris all over it.  Meanwhile, there were about 5 servers standing around at the bar talking because they weren't busy.  Maybe they could take turns running a sweeper and cleaning the tables instead of standing around.  I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like if the part of the restaurant customers see is so bad.  I won't eat at this location again."}
{"text":"About every Tuesday, me and a best friend of mine go up there for $9.99 all-you-can-eat wing night (plus other foods at the buffet as well), and they have a great staff as well as great food (including their wings - the mother of all wings!).  We will definitely be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"I had not eaten at one of these in years, so we went to this one after we got into Pittsburgh. I was reminded why it had been years.....

I don't know which was worse the service or the food. It really does not matter, because both were equally terrible. There were 5 of us, and everyone ordered something different so we had 5 different menu options represented. The best one was considered 'not completely awful.' That was the best....

As bad as the food was, the service was not going to allow itself to be outdone.  In this race for the bottom, the clear losers were the customers. There were no winners 

If the choice is this place or reheating last night's dinner then do yourself a favor and reheat"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars primarily for the price of drinks.  There's not too many airport bars in the country where you can get bottle of beer for four bucks or less and 20 ounce pints for 6 bucks or less.  This place delivers, and because of this I always try and make a quick stop here prior to boarding a flight.  The wings are pretty good, though not as spicy as some of the names may allude.  The buckeye barbecue ones are my favorite.  I haven't tried much else as far as food goes."}
{"text":"Nothing special but good wings. I like their sauces but they are not as willing as other chains to offer multiple sauces. The wings are a good size and were cooked properly. I got what I expected but nothing to give it a 4 or 5 star."}
{"text":"Back in the mid 90's, my college roommates and I would make the trek from Clarion University to wait more than an hour just to eat their delicious wings at their original location in Sharon, PA. Now they have several locations throughout Southwest PA. My husband and I dined here about a month ago. Service was very slow despite it being 4 pm on a Friday. Our waitress was less than friendly and the food was mediocre. My wings were so small. There were about 2 bites per wing. My husband's burger was bland and tasteless. The decor is also dated. I get the whole car shop theme but it looks dirty and trashy. The wait staff is a bunch of 20-somethings that stand around having loud conversations while ignoring their tables. It is a shame that this place is going down the tubes. Since becoming a chain restaurant, their quality has definitely suffered. They should have stuck with having just the original restaurant in Sharon. Never going here again."}
{"text":"The wings are great (not the best I've ever had but up there) and there are a ton of flavors to choose from.  The theme of the place is cars (if you couldnt tell) so the atmosphere is really cool.  All you can eat wing night on Tues. are the best.  I have spent 3 hrs there sometimes on wing nights.  The rest of the menu is ok.  I usually just stick to the wings, but the soft pretzels are unique, taste good, and compliment the wings well.  If you are in the area it is one place you should check out, if you enjoy wings and sports bars."}
{"text":"Customer service great! While waiting the nice stuff gave me soft drinks and was very welcoming. Very clean facility, I will be back just an asome experience!"}
{"text":"Went there on a busy Tuesday night. Sat at the bar and began asking the bartender questions about their wing night. She was absolutely terrific. Explained everything patiently and made us feel welcome. We ordered wings and they were fantastic. They came out quickly and were cooked to perfection. Basically I had to be dragged out of the place before I joined the chickens in wing heaven. Craft beers are a little on the pricy side but they do have a beer of the month that is discounted. Overall a very good dining experience. This location is expertly managed and operated."}
{"text":"Normally we love this place Columbus,Independence,Oh. This one one of the absolute most horrible meals we have ever had Bucket of wings sub par,cheese steak meat was so full of grit and fat how do you screw up a cheese steak, kids cheese burger was over seasoned with pepper it was not edable disgusting. 75 bucks seriously. Should have known no one there on a Sunday at 2pm. Service ok. But I can honestly say We'll never want Steak and lube again. The Rallys we had yesterday was gourmet compared to this place."}
{"text":"Good food and a fun atmosphere.  The kids love sundays because they have a balloon maker."}
{"text":"My first time here to listen to a live music. I just can't say the name of this place; find it awfully odd, but hey...to each state their own. Their pub chips were home made and pretty good (ordered a second batch for the table). The burger and french fries was good, too. My friend ordered a meal (steak, potato) and enjoyed all of her food. The service was okay. Waitress kept forgetting parts of our orders and wasn't consistent but she was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!  So many different types of sauces!!!!

i love hot wings!!!  Wings has to be my most favoritest thing as appetizer.  When I was on business trip to WI and saw Quaker Steak & Lube, i HAD to go there. decor was pretty cool~  family oriented restaurants.  I order all you can eat wing thing on the menu (Tuesdays).  I tried various flavors.  I gotta say, i didn't have a favorite flavors but i have to say i was pretty surprised by their spicy ones (i tried the second spiciest one on the menu).  WOW!!!!! they make you sign their waiver before you can order them! and i gladly signed the waiver.  i don't think i've EVER had anything that spicy before!!! hhahaha. it was a challenge. I couldn't finish all of it, it was just too spicy.. i thought i was gonna die!! hhahaha! and I LOVE spicy food.  but i wouldn't try that again. it didn't have flavor.  sad... 

Service was great.  Can't complain. it was overall a good experience =)"}
{"text":"Amazing place, for both meat lovers,  AND vegetarians! ! They have amazing food, from the appetizers, to desserts!  And vegetarians,  don't hesitate to ask for the black bean burger as a substitute for any of the meat burgers!! Amazing place for Nascar fans! They have lots of race cars, corvettes, ect. Hanging from the ceiling, and lots of other race merchandise too! And great place for the kids!  They give the kids a free cardboard car they can assemble themselves! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Visiting here from California. Really cool theme going on inside the restaurant! Wings were good, had to try since they're considered \"best wings in the US\" but honestly, I've had better. Really good experience though."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch during a shopping trip to Pittsburgh.  We were seated right away. but sat there for 20 minutes & no even one came over to get our drink order, so we got up and left.  As we were walking out we told the hostess we were leaving because of their poor service & she just laughed.  We have been to other locations & never experienced such poor service.  We will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"Arizona el camino burger is delicious. Onion rings came out hot and fresh. Garlic wings were tasty with some heat behind them.  Fries are seasoned and pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the buffet on the Fourth of July. It was just ok. I don't really know what else to say about it. Burgers were eh. Hotdogs,eh.  Wings good but a bit dried out.  All in all, I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy the food at Quaker State, but this review is not about the food but in fact the manager at the location on canal road named Mose. We went through the drive through to order our food, there were two cars pulled over to the right of us waiting on their food, there was a black sporty car with tinted Windows to the left of us sitting out about four feet out which left us with very little room to pass through, we inquired whose car that was  the employee said the manager we asked if she could ask him to move his car; not only did he not move  his car but instead sent another employee to play traffic director to help us move around his car. Needless to say I am appalled at this type of unprofessional behavior we were paying customers. I am doubtful about returning there. What ever happened to common courtesy?"}
{"text":"We came here after the Pirate game which was about 9:00 PM.  This location is easy to get to, across from Robinson Mall and nearby other stores and hotels. We found a parking spot right in front of the restaurant.  The decor is to resemble a garage with cars and motorcycles hanging from walls and ceilings.  We ate in the dining area but there is a bar area too.  Our booth had wings, ribs, chicken tenders and the steak and shrimp.  If you like beer, they have a huge glass called the tankster which is like 32 oz.  All in all, the food was good and reasonable.  We will come again."}
{"text":"Can't believe how this place is still in business. Took too long for our food considering it was empty. And when my pork tacos was served to me they were soggy and falling apart. Had a steak that wasnt cooked right either. Very disappointing. Never again!"}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube has, in my opinion, THE best wings around.  Huge selection of sauces- choose carefully, my friend, lest you sear your tongue.  My personal fave is the garlic sauce, followed by the regular 'hot' sauce.  

It's a little odd to eat/drink beneath stock cars and motorbikes suspended from the ceiling, until you realize they're really not going to fall on your head.  Hmm-wonder if that ever happened?  I digress..

Fairly decent menu, two bars and OK prices.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Food was good. Just your average wings burgers place. Food came out pretty fast. Our server was awesome though. Nothing too exciting about this place, but it was good."}
{"text":"Last night I went out with some co-workers after a long day and week of work, we were originally gonna go to Buffalo Wild Wings but the other guys changed their minds and wanted to come here instead. I heard good things about Quaker Steak and had never been to one so I decided it would be a good place to try. 

To start off we got there on a Friday night and it was very packed, we had to wait a half hour for a table for five. Not really their fault they were very busy so can't complain much there. When we were seated we all got drinks fairly quickly but our waitress the whole time seemed like she wanted to get out of there and wasn't all that cheerful, not rude just uninterested in doing her job. We all ordered different things, I got a grilled chicken wrap for ten bucks. We ended up waiting for our food about as long as it took to seat us, a bit annoying. But our waitress did at least refill our drinks frequently, so she at least put some effort into it. We did get our food at once and I admit my wrap was pretty tasty, you can choose whatever wing sauce you want to put on it, although the fries were not all warm and were kind of soggy.

After our meal she disappeared twice after giving and collecting our bills, very strange although I assume she must have had other tables. But they ended up messing up a couple things others in my group asked for. Nothing major but as my friend put it It's not as though it wouldn't reflect in the tip or anything.

So I'll end up giving this 3/5 overall, nothing fancy about it but not run down either. I've had much worse service but better as well. The food was decent, the place wasn't dirty at least but I'd try to improve the service staff if I were the manager. I may come back but it won't be my first choice when going out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite wing stops. Never been disappointed and have tried a variety of wings except for the atomic or triple atomic I'm not brave enough for that!  My wife usually gets the boneless and I end up finishing hers and they're good too. The only down side ever has been the wait to sit and eat. Unfortunately it's a busy place at times and might take longer than other wing joints. That being said we continue to patronize when in the area.  They also have great drinks and a great happy hour especially when getting tankers!"}
{"text":"I've  been to a few QS&L's over the years, around the country. The one in Madison, WI always had a nice bike night....

Anyway, I've always found their food to be perfectly acceptable. Obviously one is not looking for gourmet quality food at QS&L, but just decent quality bar food and cold beer is fine, along with a nice, fun, environment.

Well, the QS&L in Pineville sucks.... there's no other way to put it.

Actually, our beer was cold.... and the food was ok. I had a pasta bowl thing, that was pretty good. Wife had a shrimp basket that she didn't really like - the shrimp were more breading than shrimp and very oily in a bad-deep fried kind of way.

The BIGGEST problem of our visit was the idiot tending bar. We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty slow. We sat, and she continued to talk to her co-worker for 5 minutes. When she finally did come over, there was no apology, or even a friendly hello.... just, \"what do you want\".

We should have followed out instincts and left right then and there.

Her service never did improve... even though she only had us, and a guy and his son at the bar.

I was going to speak to the manager, but he didn't really seem to care about too much either.

Stay away."}
{"text":"Good concept, great wings, family friendly, for what the place is, great food, well executed. My son loves the place and they give you a gigantic popsicle for dessert. What's not to love..."}
{"text":"Stopped by there last night with the kid for a meal. We both opted for all you can eat wings, which was not a bad value even though we didn't try to 'get our money's worth' by eating eight gazillion tons of wings. The two guys at the table across from us had built a mighty tower of discarded bones, though- it looked like a scene from Conan the Barbarian.

The wings were just OK, not very warm.  The sauces are good, though. Service was not the greatest, and while I understand that AYCE wing night is a tough one, the automatic 18% gratuity doesn't exempt them from being a little more prompt.  What did grind my gears is that the gratuity was added after tax.  Even though it doesn't add a lot to the total tip,it is cheating just a little bit."}
{"text":"Wings were ok at best, my main qualm here is the service. The waitress only returned to the table once during the whole meal, and the restaurant was far from busy. I specifically requested a game be put on the tv. Waitress seemed reluctant, and took 15 minutes to put the game on. A mere 5 minutes later another staff member changed it to something else. Was going to order more food and hang around for the rest of the game but after this we decided to leave. Bad service, average food, won't return for awhile."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but problems from them not receiving my order and then when they make it they forget party of my order. I have too check my order every time I get takeout. And getting sauces is like pulling teeth. I avoid that place as much as I can. My husband likes the wings but I go get it duo he doesn't have to deal with their rude takeout people."}
{"text":"I had a burger it was not good at all. The bun was hard as a rock. My daughter loved her wings. It wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Service was adequate. Server greeted me quickly but didn't return after dropping off my food until I was done.

Ordered a burger medium rare. Was served a burger that was barely cooked on the outside and was completely raw in the middle. Not pink - raw cold hamburger. Told the waitress I wasn't planning to be fussy but I just couldn't finish it. She argued with me about the definition of medium rare.

I won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Was in last Saturday, sat on the patio. Service was ok but not great. Food was all cold, fries, wings, everything. Then it was really bad when people at bar lit up cigs a foot away from where we were all eating. Didn't say anything because the bartender, waitress and everyone treated them like regulars so I guess...Idk pretty terrible experience, keep giving quaker chances to make it up because its convenient but they continue to disappoint."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS IN AMERICA! I grew up in Mentor and I'm so disappointed we got a Quaker Steak now that I'm living in LA... BUT it's more of a reason to come home! I used to drive to Sharon, PA for my Quaker Steak fix as I was growing up and always loved the wings so much. When I came in town last summer, I planned a get together with 20 of my friends and the staff at Quaker Steak was so helpful. They weren't supposed to take reservations but accommodated me because I am such a big fan and only in town for a short time. I really appreciated that! I'm a huge chicken wing eater... I eat them once a week here in Los Angeles at different establishments but nothing compares to Quaker Steak for me! Can't wait to be back!"}

This time the waitress was knowledgeable and knew everything that they had the seasonal beers on draft and was courteous and friendly and took our order and we (mrs and myself) ordered the exact same thing we did the last time we were in and ONCE AGAIN, our order came out messed up ... Asked for all drum wings and ended up with half flats / half drums, stopped the waitress and she said \"oh no problem, I'll get that fixed for you\" so I get a new wings out and the replacements are all FLATS, the mrs and I looked at each other like SERIOUSLY !?!? AVOID this QSAL at all costs WILL NOT EVER GO BACK (would leave HALF A STAR IF I COULD"}
{"text":"We've dined in at this location 2 times, mostly due to convenience, not because the food is all that good. My husband and I received a gift card, and this particular night we wanted to try the order online and pick up option. We showed up 20 minutes later, like the website told us to, they seemed confused, and then we waited over 30min to get our food! We honestly think they started our order once we showed up, even though they had it in their system. Then when we got home the order wasn't even right (we didn't check on location because we were starving and ready to get out.) They didn't even apologize. Never again."}
{"text":"ok......
        I know its not supposed to be a high class place but when a waitress shows up with your beers holding a kid and then says something to the effect of \"my friend stopped by and handed me her kid\" its a little odd. I understand life is a lot to handle, but I cant say I would have expected that here.
        The wings were pretty good, Im not a \"wing guy\" but I do like them on occasion. the beer was cold, the appetizers decent and as generic as an Applebees would be. This kind of place was original when there was one location. now its an over the top gimmick kind of place and I couldn't say I see myself going back any time soon.  
        I know its not really the establishments fault but there were a bunch of kids running wild and I think it was bad enough to where the management should have said something to the people that were supposed to be parents. 
        Ill keep looking for a great wing place if im really in the mood, id rather try something new then know im getting nothing really great. 

the only reason id go back is if I cant convince the group to go somewhere else. That is the truth...."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Bike Night is a must at this place.  What fun.  I have done the lunch buffet on a few occasions and I really enjoy the wings.  Nice sports bar but yet a good family place you can take the kids too.  Also its cool to walk in and see TV's in the floor.  That is a cool feature."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Quaker Steak and Lube over the years. Tonight was by far the worst I've ever had. I made the mistake of ordering their \"classic\" steak sandwich. The steak was hard and crunchy, completely tasteless. The powers and onions had to have been cooked to death or boiled because they had zero flavor. The entire sandwich was dry, bland, almost cardboard on bread. I will never return."}
{"text":"I stopped in after work for a couple beers and wings with some good friends.  The beer was cold so kudos for that. The bartender was also cool so that helps.  Here's the thing, this used to be a wing place and now you can barely find them on the menu.  I also got a pretzel that was loaded with some sort of liquid grease coating.  I'll be back again but I never expect anything exciting here."}

{"text":"Well I'm Alex's coworker (bestest buddy) and am going to join her on the wagon train of reviews. We just left there disappointed. 
First impressions the waitress wasn't very forthcoming. I get ppl have bad days. But I tried joking with her to lighten her up. Nope. Didn't work. 

I ordered the Mahi fish tacos. 
I follow a Keto lifestyle. No carbs. So my tacos I ordered without the tortillas. They came out in a bowl, with a soggy pile of coleslaw with I dare say-- 5oz of Fish???? On top. Nothing else. I asked for some lettuce and tomato to put with it. Just to liven it up a bit. .   I admit I've never had their fish tacos, but they weren't good. Even if they were served standard-- I believe I would have been disappointed. 

Onto the wings. They came out and I cannot believe the lack of flavor and pizazz. #1. For 13.99 I expected more. Yes I did take my friends' wings home that she complained about. And when I got home I counted 18 wings that we had together. For $28???? What?? 
Did I mistakingly get a steak there and had a relapse from a bad trip??? Noooooo. 
Just 2 orders of chicken wings. 

I emailed the company because I want a refund. I'm so sick of being jipped by businesses trying to get by serving subpar food. 

The manager???? Asian man who was Kristens food runner-- neither apologized to Alex nor offered to remake or replace her wings. Yes--- they were overdone. Yes. This place is probably not the hot spot in Medina. But come on!!!!! Wings are NOT  a culinary genius dish and when your company's motto is about their \"award winning wings\".... it would be safe to assume that even the worst cook could make something palatable. 
Nope. 

Well. Now I know. And you know too. This is very over priced bad bar food. And with it being corporate backed-- I'm actually quite shocked. 

We won't ever be back. And I suggest you hit one of the locally owned places if you don't want to waste your time and money. 
All Alex got from the manager was --- \"well( they're not for everyone \".... when she expressed her dislike of her meal. 
Shame on you!!! I'm asking for a refund from the company and I expect to get it. I will leave an update once I hear from someone!!!"}
{"text":"It's been three years since I've last eaten at one of these, and I had high expectations.  I am not sure if it were just an off day, trainees in the kitchen, or a stingy cook, but the wings were extremely dry and had little sauce.

The service itself was good, but the wings weren't best to what I was accustomed to and were far from \"Best Wings\""}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time today. I had never been to a QS but had heard good things and had high expectations. Unfortunately, these expectations weren't met. When I walked in, desiring a seat at the bar, the host seemed a little put off. I walked outside to the patio bar and overall it seemed a little dirty and unkept, as if it had been abandoned. Once a server walked up, I asked for a draft list and she pulled out a \"cheat sheet\" from her server booklet and handed it to me. A few moments later, a different server came to get my order so I was a bit confused as to who was serving me. I mentioned that I had never been here before and asked which wing flavor was the best and how many came in an order. Her and the other server turned to each other and exchanged glances before turning back to me, which was fairly rude. I placed my order and waited for my food. Wait was an average wait so no complaints there. When my food was dropped off, the server made sure I had everything (napkins etc) and walked away. The food quality was just average. While the fries were delicious, there weren't very many of them. The wing flavor was very good, but the wings themselves were a little dry and very very lean. Carrots that accompanied them were a little dry and hard as well. When I was finished, the server asked if I needed anything else and when I said just the check, she instantly placed the receipt on the bar, as if she was in a hurry to get rid of me. It then took quite a while for her to pick up the check. When she brought it back, she said \"here you go\" and walked away. No \"goodbye\", no \"Thank you.\" Overall, I can see nothing that would want me to come back again. Average food, ok atmosphere, poor service.

{"text":"I was in Akron for business and Quaker Steak & Lube was highly recommended as a definite go-to. When I checked my GPS it was a 25 minute drive and almost decided against making the trip. I am so glad I did not make that decision...

I arrived way before any dinner and/or happy hour crowd and even though I got there when business was expected to be at a lull, I was greater at the door with a smile. I was immediately drawn to the eclectic atmosphere  outdoors by the stock car and camaro strip racing cars and it only got better indoors -  antique Harley Davidson suspended from the ceiling, a wall of chrome rims, license plates, photos, and car memorabilia on the walls and ceiling.

My server was very pleasant and knowledgeable. I ordered the mac-n-cheese burger and was told Monday night is burger night and that half-pound delight burger was only $6.95! Prepared to order and served with homemade chips lightly seasoned. The mac-n-cheese was topped with fresh made bacon crumbles, lettuce, and red onion - yum!

Finished off with chocolate stout cake to go.

I would recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Speedy service, attentive staff, good all American bar food, including breakfast and beer on tap. Sports bar."}
{"text":"My dad recommended that a friend and I stop here for a bloody mary before our flight to Vegas in June. I'm a bloody mary fiend and why not start a trip to Vegas with some booze at 7:30am?!

The service was not stellar, but it wasn't the worst. The other patrons were pushy with the bartender and a little annoying. But, hey. You're in an airport. Everyone is pushy and annoying...and rude and smelly and loud and the worst. I'm not fond of airports, can you tell?

Anyways, this place isn't about quality food or service. It's about getting the job done. And it did it. The bloody mary was super tasty, we got a buzz, we had our liquid breakfast, and we calmly boarded our flight to Vegas on time. Bam."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Server struggled when it came to personally .  Manager and staff took over 45 minutes to figure out the bill. 12 kids and 10 adults bills were too much to handle. Sad that they could not handle simple math."}
{"text":"This is a favorite lunch-buffet stop for me and my brother-in-law.  They do a really nice job rotating dishes...and of course there wings are really solid.

Always enjoy coming here...rarely have a bad meal."}
{"text":"Had a cold appetizer. Was told they would remake it and bring it back out. Our entrees came out 10 minutes later. 
I told them to nevermind the appetizer at this point since we already got the entrees. 
All we received was a simple \"I'm sorry\".
We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great staff and good food!  Love the Tuesday buffet night.  I have now tried at least half of the flavors of wings."}
{"text":"I went here for the brunch buffet on Sunday. Oddly enough, their brunch spread is better than their lunch spread. Bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, home fries, french toast, 2 types of wings, chicken nuggets in Thai chile sauce, garlic chicken, pita bread, BBQ hame, Wedding Soup and a little salad bar. The highlight is the waffle station and omelet station. There were only six toppings for the omelets and I don't know about the waffles. The cooks were friendly. Actually, everyone was friendly. The waitress loved our daughter and kept trying to give her sweets.

I like bacon. Alot. And I like fresh made omelets. And wings. I will probably be back for the brunch buffet.

Also, I'll probably come back some time for wings at night."}
{"text":"love this place ----food NEVER dissapoints, love the bartenders, great service---never had a bad experience the many times i've been there. can't wait until st. patty's day for the green beer!!"}
{"text":"Kim was lousy as the bartender! Only selected certain patrons to tend to. JACKED UP service! Will only come when Kirk is working the bar."}
{"text":"The breaded boneless wings at Quaker Steak are pretty gross. I recently ordered boneless wings (breaded, not grilled) and all of the wing sauce (and grease?) had absorbed into the breading making them soggy and greasy. I keep trying to think of another descriptive word, but gross is pretty accurate. The wing sauce itself was supposed to be medium and should have had a little kick to it, but didn't. I threw the wings out (insert sad face here) and felt gross for eating what I had.  

I haven't ever had anything great from the menu - at this location or any other location. Overpriced and mediocre (at best) is a pretty good summary of all of my visits to Quaker Steak. No need to return. 

Service is okay. Parking is good as there are parking spots in the front of the building and a large parking lot behind the building."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday around 5pm. Pleasantly greeted at the door and quickly seated. Our waitress was helping another table, but briefly stopped by and said she'd be with us shortly...nice jester to show that she knows we are there! Food came out smoking fast. Wings were saucy, large and delicious. The only downside of the meal was the waitress not coming back for drinks very often. Most of the time our water glasses were empty while we ate. 

Besides the great food and quick service, the best part was the manager, Jami. I stopped at Quaker Steak to eat during a several hour drive home, and about 45 minutes after leaving the restaurant I stopped to get gas. Soon I realized I had never gotten my credit card back! I quickly called the restaurant; however, I didn't feel it was worth driving an additional 1.5+ hours to pick up the card, so I decided to cancel it. I talked to Jami on the phone and she said they would shred it and send me confirmation of it being shredded and properly disposed of. Soon after I was able to see the card get destroyed. She went way over and beyond in helping me out! Very nice of her and shows a lot about the team at Quaker Steak and Lube."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't eaten the wings at Quaker Steak.  I settled on the grilled boneless wings with whatever is the 3rd hottest sauce on the menu.  Yes, I like my food super spicy.  The sauce was killer good and it delivered the right potency for my heat-seeking self.  Our server was a complete flake.  We had to ask her to clear the table multiple times.  And she didn't come by enough for drink refills.  We ended up going to the bar to refill our drinks.  What's up with the plastic lawn chairs for seating?  That's kinda cheap!"}
{"text":"Super slow.  I mean wickedly slow.  Beefcake bartender was extremely friendly and polite to us which was great.  Food is mediocre even though they expanded the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious! Pleasantly surprised. I got the dynamite chicken crunch wrap and it was spicy and sweet. Fries were good too. Wrap is huge, took half home."}
{"text":"Overall I AM a fan of the people, place, and food though the service is a little slower than I typically care for. That being said it is always friendly, positive, and sometimes cute. That's not really here nor there. 

I think the boneless wings in all the QSLs are a little tough but the bone-ins are fantastic. That said last time I was at this location I took the triple atomic challenge; Boneless. I got seven boneless instead of six. My beer and wife's drink Were needed! 
My server, Jess, was magnificent and quite fun and funny. It's hit or miss here but that day was certainly a hit!
It's nice decor, on nice days the front opens up, and within walking distance to the library, my favorite place in Lakewood. Daily specials help, some, with the over-priced food. 
I'll keep going!"}
{"text":"Wings very tasty, wish the breading was just a bit less but, they are not greasy and very moist, steak was awesome, daughter had ribs & reported they r gr8! Dont know why the bad reviews. I plan to return. You should too! Nice selection of tap beers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch. Server suggested the buffet so I went with that for lunch. Figured, Quaker Steak is known for wings, even has signage all over the store touting wings, one would expect wings on the buffet. What a disappointment when I discovered two selections of boneless wings (no real chicken wings to be found), one with a mediocre sauce, the other no sauce (aka Chicken McNuggetts - oh wait, McNuggetts are served hotter and taste better) and that was it. Some \"baked\" chicken strips with no breading and a little bit of cold sauce on them and some un-sauced popcorn chicken. Worse yet, the wings on the buffet started out as cold, and in the 20 minutes I was in the store, not once did hot (temperature) wings get put out. The \"Italian\" dishes were quality wise, on a par with institutional food (and were also not being kept hot on the buffet). Today was the biggest waste of time and money I have spent in years. The only bright spot was that my server, Allee, had a cute smile, was positive and upbeat, and she kept my tea glasses full. Unfortunately, if the food quality is not there, it does not matter how good the service is, you will continue to lose customers (heard a lot of disgruntled comments - apparently this \"new\" buffet is a recent thing). Bottom line, worst meal I have had in years, no management coming around asking about satisfaction, and the total bill, 13.69 + tip. Not somewhere I will plan on returning, nor will I recommend it to anyone, just the opposite, I will be letting everyone know about the quality issues.  Someone needs to figure out what a thermometer is and how to use it to keep the hot food hot on a buffet and not invite all sorts of bacteria to start growing on chicken (and everything else) that is slightly above room temperature."}
{"text":"Had a great time here on a Saturday night!  Great food, attentive server, good beer and staff very friendly.  Had the veggie flatbread pizza, the whitefish and chips, and the fried pickle appetizer.  All were excellent!  The only drawback: Beer was a little pricey.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay. What do you expect from airport food & service? It was defiantly reasonably priced. I got a Chicken Wrap, I would eat it again and the server was really casual but friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after a Valley view movie. Melissa was our waitress, and she was awesome! Recommended food that was on happy hour prices, which meant my daughter got a burger, and I got several small sets of wings at reduced prices. And my huge 32 oz draft beer was on happy hour prices too. Melissa was more than attentive to us while she was busy with a large party. She got us refills on pop n water without us asking, and hooked me up with my request for a bun less burger. I'm doing low carb.  Wings were very tasty n crispy. My burger was tasty as well. I'm glad we got happy hour prices, cuz they can be expensive. I will definitely be back tho."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings you'll find anywhere I eat the Louisiana Lickers every time but have tried most of the sauces including the Atomic Sauce don't consider this sauce for a meal you just need a taste and move on. They have a full bar so your Red Bull and Goose is available just as good as the one in Erie. PA"}
{"text":"Good food.  Good place that stays up late after Cedar Point Hours but the service sucks.  We eat here a lot after visiting the park.  Servers will take your order, come back with food, and come back with the bill.  Don't expect any more than that.  Every once in a while you get a good server but most of the time they are terrible."}
{"text":"It's not a gourmet restaurant.  It's airport food.  But it's in a fun atmoshpere, has a little bit of connection to the region, and can claim some 'best of' awards.
I get the sense that is can be hit or miss here - but its an airport - and if you're hungry, you need it, and you're probably not going to get anything on the plane..."}
{"text":"Good wings 

Many nightly activities.

Monday night football
Tuesday night AYCE wings.
Wednsday night Biker Night
Thursday night Kareoke.

The wing challenge to get your picture on the wall. Is fun to watch your co-workers to do. However I do not recommend sitting next to them the following day."}
{"text":"Great for a casual lunch, there is a lunch buffet with basic bar food and you can also order wings at no extra cost with the buffet...all you can eat, including ordered wings. There is also dessert on the buffet. Service was excellent, food was good...no complaints, this is a restaurant we have come to at least five times and always have a good experience."}
{"text":"As a resident of Concord since before the arrival of Concord Mills, and back when Nascar's biggest trophy was sponsored by a cigarette company, I've been exposed to all kinds of new places to eat.  I'll admit, as a culinary student, I also have fairly high expectations.  There's nothing really wrong here, it just doesn't really carry that wow factor that even some of the other area chains have.  I truly wish I could give have stars because 60% seems cruel but I can't bring myself to give it 80% either. My major issue with today's visit is that my friend that I am with today has to eat gluten free due to a severe autoimmune disorder. Although they have a gluten free menu (we checked before we arrived), it is almost a year out of date.  Allergy menus are required to be updated monthly, and this one in particular (at least the one in the restaurant) expired in October of 2013.  This, although seemingly innocent, is a severe health code violation.  Other than that, the food and service was about as good as you can expect from a corporate chain. Thanks for reading! New adventures to come."}
{"text":"Family stopped here for lunch before heading to Pittsburgh Airport.  It's just off the Parkway West and easily located.  
The menu is almost overwhelming, but our server gave us extra time to make our choices.   Of course, wings are the obvious choice and the ones we had as an appetizer were very good.  They offer a lunch buffet and it seemed most of the patrons were there for that.  
Favorite item picked was the buffalo Mac and cheese.  Husband loved it! In fact, I couldn't get a photo because he was already eating. 
I liked my boneless wings that came with huge onion rings.  Our son had a enormous hamburger with fries.  The server was attentive and considerate.
I am looking forward to stopping by here again."}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes @ table, forced to get up & go upfront too see why no one had come for service...
Food took forever!!!"}
{"text":"Love Quaker Steak and Lube...just not this one.  (2.5 stars)  It is not bad and I am sure it is better then a lot of other places in the local area.  But I am comparing this to the other QS&L.

So first, the wings are good.  A little much on the sauce, but better than too little.  We ordered 2 racks of baby back ribs.  Both over cooked and dry.  I did not count the ribs, but sure seemed like we were a few short.  They cut them in half before we say them.  Anyway, they were the smallest racks I have ever seen.  Must be Guyenne pigs. 

Service was okay.  They were more interested in flirting with the male table where the beer was flowing then the family table.  I guess the hope of tips out ways.

Anyway, I don't want to be too hard.  the Manager did stop by (early) to make sure we had received our appetizers.  She was great.  very engaging and wanted to make sure we were do9ing okay.  Just need that to rub off on the others."}
{"text":"Okay, it is not a posh, new wave coffee house or Bistro... it is a wing / burger joint that turns into a biker hangout once a week during the summer and a sports bar all the time.  But, it is awesome.  The inside is always clean and the wait staff attentive and friendly.  It has its on NASCAR / Motorcycle atmosphere thing going on.  It just is what it is.  

So the important stuff, the food.  These are the best wings going, anywhere.  The sauces are different and flavorful. My personal choice, Buckeye BBQ.  It is up on the heat range, but only enough to get the endorphin's moving and still allow you to enjoy yourself.  They also have a great selection of Burgers.  

On Mondays, Burger night.  Burgers and side are like $5.99 I believe.  On Tuesdays they have an all you can eat wing buffet. Awesome thing here is if they don't have what you want at the bar, they will make it for you. 

So if you are looking for a great place to hang out with friends and family, get great winds and enjoy the eveining, this is place."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time on Tuesday and it was great! Awesome beer specials and service was great. And it was all you can eat wing night. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I order a few times to go not doing that again you must eat the food right away because the bread can be so soggy and it does not taste good at all when you reheat burgers to warm it up. Everytime the managers get the feedback they do what they can to make things right but still you don't wanna order a to go burger from this establishment if your not going to eat it right away."}
{"text":"Is it just me or do the prices go up every time I go there. Ordered the boneless wing salad to go. Paid $9 for a half empty box of wilted lettuce. They forgot the dressing. Worst of all the container they put the chicken into exploded because ti was too full and filled the bag with chicken and sauce. The celery had all those stringy bits that should be removed and were brown at the edges. They couldn't even get the pita on the side right. For Christ sake would it hurt to warm that stuff up. Did I mention I paid  dollars for half a salad and a mess to clean up. I WILL NEVER DINE HERE AGAIN OR PICK UP. I felled totally duped. I also had to wait 30 minutes to pick up and order I called in 40 minutes ago. Get your shit together!"}
{"text":"This just opened down the block. I have never been to a Quaker Steak so my only comparison would be to BW3. The place is definitely nicer, better lit and more family-oriented than a BW3s. The patio area and front windows make it seem very open even though it is in a kind of narrow space. We went at a peak time, about 6 PM on a Sunday, and although the place was packed, we were seated quickly. The service was a tad slow, probably due to the crowd, but overall the server was attentive and got everything right and remembered refills or requests when she came around. 

I got the half ribs and wings combo. The ribs were perfect, falling off the bone and tender with a delicious sauce.  I ordered the \"hot\" wings which are their plain Buffalo-style standard and they tasted just like standard hot wings anywhere else would taste. I will try some of the other flavors when I go back. 

My wife had the pan-Asian salmon bowl and enjoyed it. Her fish was cooked properly and the she said the sauce was tasty. 

It's definitely a chain restaurant, in that the menu is huge and geared towards fast, large portions and repeated basic combinations. That said, it was tasty and satisfying. I am not a big sports bar person, so I liked to be able to get some wings with the family without it feeling like a dank hole that smells like stale beer."}
{"text":"It must have been an off night, but my wings were horrible.  We ordered several different flavors and they were all bland and greasy.  The temperature at the place must have been over 80' and the decor looked worn down like our waitress."}
{"text":"This place reeks of something that is not normal for a restaurant, a cross between a gas station and maybe a local county jail.  According to the locals, this was a good place for wings, so here we go. From the outside, I wouldn't tell if I was going to get food or maybe a lube job on my Ford F-150. I seriously think someone was like... \"I wonder what a Green Johnny Rockets which sold wings, in the shape of a Gas and Service Station might look like...\" and suddenly here it is. 

Okay, the food...

It's OKAY.  Nothing that was super or amazing.  It's food that you would expect from a place that looks like a Gas Station.   

What they call a Compact Bucket, is really just a medium sized basket.  You can split the flavors, which of course they charge 99 cents more.  REALLY? Okay, the wings were tasty, but they were nothing special, perhaps if I wanted to light my fact on fire, I would have asked for the Atomic or Triple Atomic wings, but I doubt that many come here for the food in general, more like the challenge they saw on Man VS Food. 

Their menu items plainly tell the story of their theme...a Sidecar of Steamed Broccoli?  More like a small tea cup dish of vegetables.  What about a Garage Salad? Well, this is really descriptive, as their \"Garage\" is their \"House\" Salad, which in terms of following the theme, they are spot on.  The \"House\" Salad is perfectly shaped like an old garage of a Johnny Rockets.  

And why they did they call a small order of Onion Rings... Ahem... Short Otenna O-Rings?  My spell-check is going crazy trying to rack it's English Dictionary around how the world Antenna suddenly became something foreign and perhaps going as far as made up.   

Oh yeah, those items were mediocre. 

Seriously, why?  Sure maybe they are yummy; of course when you have not eaten for 12 hours, they become much better tasting.  Pretty sure this place does well, in locations where their clientele are hard working folk, who are looking at quantities of calories, rather than quality of the flavors used.  

You get three stars, because it was amusing to attempt to read the menu, and the garage motif is generously used, EVERYWHERE."}
{"text":"It's a wing joint.  Much better than b dubs but inconsistent. However I, my fellow yelpers, have discovered the secret. Go on Tuesday night when they have the buffet. DO NOT actually get the buffet. It's gross. But to prepare for Tuesday they bring in a ton of wings and crank up those fryers. We all know the secret to good fresh restaurant food is turning over the inventory.  And man do they turn it over on Tuesday. We had the best, freshest bucket of wings I've ever had last night. We get medium with a side car of supercharged sauce.  Wing heaven."}
{"text":"I MISS my Fort Wayne hot wings and QS&L's Louisiana Lickers hot sauce is as close as I've come to those juicy nuggets of goodness.  Though some seating is rather chilly when the cold air rushes in with the door open, there are cozy seats to be found in the winter and there is also a lunch buffet for those that enjoy buffets.  The first recent visit here we had over the top service and last time a quieter, yet still (if not more) efficient server.  The fried pickles are full spears, the pretzels are delish, and the boneless wings aren't overly breaded.  They're starting to become a favorite!"}
{"text":"This was my first ever Quaker Steak & Lube experience.  I had seen it before in an episode of Man vs. Food where he did the hot wing challenge.  I came here at lunch time and they do a lunch buffet.  Typically, I am not the biggest buffet fan because sometimes the food seems like it has been sitting out for a while but definitely not this place.  Everything tasted incredibly hot and fresh.  Even the french fries - they tasted like they just came out of the fryer and they were good.

There was a pretty decent selection for the lunch buffet - I sampled the pierogies, some chipped beef, french fries and, of course, the wings.  I happened to like everything.  Very impressive.  

On to the wings review.  The wings were served dry, but they had a ton of sauces that you could try out.  The wings weren't breaded, but they were pretty crispy.  I decided to go with the hot sauce and it had some nice zip to it.  I'm not a huge fan of trying all of those whacky sauce combinations, but if you like that, then you will probably like this place even more.  I would actually like to come back here and try some of their hottest wings.  I'm a fan of these wings.  I will definitely have no problem coming back to Quaker Steak & Lube.  

Apparently they also have some all-you-can-eat specials on Tuesday nights.  Another plus for me is that they serve Pepsi products."}
{"text":"I've been to the Quaker Steak & Lube a number of times, the food is decent and I've never had bad service until today.  Actually bad is an understatement.  3 of us came in for a late lunch, it wasn't at all crowded and we got drinks pretty quickly, but needed a couple more min to order lunch.  We waited for what seemed like a good 15-20 min for our waiter to come back, he didn't.  A waitress eventually came over and told us he had left and she wasn't sure if we ordered or not.  We sat there waiting another 20 min or so for the food, again it was fairly sparse in there.  When the food finally came out, I was given the wrong salad.  The guy who brought the food out was very nice and apologetic about the screw up and said he'd get order the salad for me right away.  Its now 2pm and I'm feeling light headed after the long wait so I asked him if I could have a couple of pieces of chicken from the other salad since I had to wait.  He was very accommodating and left the entire wrong salad saying we could have as much of it as we like since it would be thrown out anyway.  A few min later the waitress that took the order comes out and also apologizes about the wrong salad and proceeds to take it away, I told her what the other guy said and practically had to pry the salad away from her - I've had like 1 piece of chicken at that point.  The waitress then comes back with a side dish containing what should have been on the salad I actually ordered with the intent of dumping it on top of the gross ice berg lettuce which I don't eat.  I again tell her that I was expecting the salad I ordered which she then brings without the chicken on it.  Seriously?  Then some other guy stops by who is maybe the manager, and asks how everything is tasting.  I tell him its fine except I'm missing the chicken from my salad and my son's drink hasn't been refilled.  The manager was totally lame, no apology for the wait, no apology for the screw up on top of the wait.  Not sure I'll be going back to the Middleton location any time soon."}
{"text":"Went in last night 04/13/18 to watch the second part of the Indians game. Pretty terrible service. We did decide to sit at the bar but I still expect some level of service when at the bar. I believe it was the bartenders last day because she was too busy talking to her workers to check on us. My two cents is she shouldn't have been working if she no longer cared. Anyways, we ordered a round of drinks and food. One order was for the chicken wrap and the other was for CHICKEN tacos. We got our food about 35-40 minutes later. The wrap was pretty dry but may be our fault because we asked for the ranch on the side. The tacos were good for CARNITAS tacos. We ordered CHICKEN. I would have loved to have told the bartender but not once did she check on us so I wasn't about to wait another 40 minutes for new tacos. That being said, the tacos were pretty good. They have the exact same tacos the chicken ones do so I'm assuming the chicken tacos would've been good as well. Their beans and rice are really good! A little heavy on the cheese but you can easily push it aside. Anyways, I'd love to give this place a 1 because of the service but I'll be fair since my food was good. Probably won't be back for awhile because the service turned me off and there plenty other places to go to."}
{"text":"Three Stars better make it two. This was a poor outing for this particular location but will be trying it again. The manager whom you can see seated at a 4top was eating his Cheese Curds(that they don't have on the menu) The manager and servers were all helping clean up and serve in between eating from his plate.(never washing their hands)Numerous groups came in to eat and because it was busy with 0 seating ended  up leaving. Food was good as always!"}
{"text":"Deserves three stars but they are consistent with good service and the restaurant is always clean. Probably not a place I would visit too often but kids love this place. Try the onion rings."}
{"text":"The place itself is awesome with a great motorsports & vintage Americana feel to it. But we had issues with the food: I got the ribs and boneless wings and my buddy had the crispy chicken wings. Neither of us liked their food one bit and as a matter of fact we are both wide awake at 5am drinking Alka Seltzer and feeling sick. Not good, especially when you consider that we've been on the road for one week already and still have one more to go..."}
{"text":"We were there on a very slow Sunday evening, while the server was pretty good, it took forever to get our food.  The people at the bar were happy, and served drinks very quickly, but we did not get our food for almost a half hour (it was just wings and french frys.)"}
{"text":"Cool ambience.  Food is fair and what you expect from a Chili's, Applebee's competitor.  Good if you are traveling alone and want to eat and drink at the bar.  Probably a lot cooler if you aren't from the NY area and understand NASCAR."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube is one of the few places in Charlotte where you can try a variety of sauces for your chicken wings/fingers.  I've even tried their Atomic hot sauce, their hottest.  The menu says you have to sign a release form to eat it, but I never had to.  Ha ha.  Pulled one over on them!  It is extremely hot, though, and kind of ruins any flavor as it burns layers of your tongue off.  I tend to stick to one of the sauces that are a couple of notches down from Atomic.  The boneless wings are great with fries or atop a salad.  I have yet to really try anything else because if I'm going to Quaker Steak & Lube, it's usually cuz I'm craving chicken with hot sauce, but they also have sandwiches, burgers, and steaks.  

As for the atmosphere, it's a sports bar.  And if you want to be REALLY specific, it's a NASCAR bar.  If you love racing and NASCAR, Quaker Steak is THE place for you.  It's even located down the street from the speedway.  Sit back and bask, my friend.  Even though I'm not a fan of car racing, I enjoy going to Quaker Steak for the food and lively atmosphere.  And I can always count it being cleaner than some sports bars I've been to."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Really good Greek nachos and great wings."}
{"text":"Had soup and  Salad bar for lunch ....half hrs later puked repeatedly...eat at your peril"}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoyed it! 
Definitely overpriced for what you get as far as the appetizers go, but the Baja fried shrimp was delicious! Just wish there were more.
My husband and I ordered: 
hot boneless wings (great but veery small, lots of flavor but not too spicy)
Baja turkey wrap (it was the least fav item ordered, way to dry, not enough Baja sauce at all)
Fries are good!
Ordered drinks: strawberry daiquiri (very week on alcohol, tasted virgin for sure) & jack Daniels honey lemonade (naaaasty)

Atmosphere is very fun! Prob wouldn't eat here often, but I'd def come back for just the wings & beer!"}
{"text":"The best wings in Pittsburgh! 

As a part of Pittsburgh as Primanti Brothers. They have tons of different sauces from mild to so hot that you have to sign a waiver for. Some of my favorite ones are Louisiana Lickers ( a hot, cajun, garlic and barbecue mix) and Arizona Ranch. (a hot and spicy ranch) My only complaint is that the wings are really, really small. 
The wings are so good and then you're pissed that they are all gone! 
Tuesday's are all you can eat wings night so that makes it a little better. 

The loaded magna fries are great too. Fries covered with beer cheese dip, bacon, scallions and ranch. They are epic! My daughter and wife loved the onion rings. They also have soup, salads, baby back ribs, burgers, steaks and sandwiches. 

If you're ever in Pittsburgh on a lay over head to Quaker Steak. They're not far from the airport"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night which happened to be all-you-can eat wings.  I tried golden garlic(good), buckeye bbq(sucked), super charged(not very hot), and arizona ranch(very good).  They gave me 8 skimpy wings that seemed rushed by the cook.  The server worked hard and by 8pm the place was packed and had 40 waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Definitely a bro-bar/restaurant.  In fact, it's one of the biggest bro-bars that I've ever been to.  I'm guessing this is majorly due to the \"all-you-can-eat\" wings and buffet on Tuesday nights.  The beer specials are just alright ($3.75 22 oz Juengling and another daily special for every day of the week).  Because I'm a vegetarian, I stuck with fries and tried to enjoy the experience.  I wouldn't go all the way out to Robinson to eat here again, but I'd consider stopping in the branch in Oakland (that doesn't have the all-you-can-eat special; those college students would tear that place apart)."}
{"text":"A great place for wings!  They come in an assortment of different flavors and degrees of hotness!  We took our son and his wife& daughter to dinner for his 25th Birthday along with our other sons!  The guys loved the assortment of hamburgers!  Had Nachos & Mozzarella Sticks for appetizers.  The Mozzarella Sticks were lightly breaded and full of cheese!  I had the buffet and it was plentiful with an assortment of fresh garden salads, soup, pizza, breaded mushrooms, French fries, corn balls,  kielbasa, smoked sausage, meatballs and an assortment of different flavored wings.  I tried the ranch wings which were savory and lightly fried with a mild zip.  Tried the Kielbasa and it was great!  Steam roller cooked and delightfully garlicky!  Tried the Italian wedding soup which was just ok,  lacked flavor.  Ended with desserts that included vanilla and chocolate pudding, chocolate balls and a delectable lightly fried cinnamon stick that I had to go back and get more!  Buffet is great as it includes soup, salad, pizza, sausages, wings , side dishes and desert!  Not bad for 13 bucks!"}
{"text":"What a clever place. Delicious and quite entertaining menu with lots to choose from. The boom boom shrimp and lube burger were a hit among our table.  My family and kids loved it, but I really see the 60 something man in his Harley stage(my dad) loving this.  Service was a bit slow but it gave us time to check out all the bikes and cars on display."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak rocks!  Dont listen to any of the reviews with less than 4 stars - these people have no idea what they are talking about.  

We came to Madison and had to make a special trip here since seeing the Man vs Food segment where Adam takes the \"atomic wing challenge\".  They make you sign a paper saying the restaurant is not liable for any harm you do to yourself after eating 6 of these bad boys (oooh, scary!).  Andy ordered the flavour that was one less hot than the Atomic, which were called the Supercharged.  

The wings come and while they were awesome, they werent anywhere close to the heat level I was expecting.  I wanted to be writhing on the floor in pain, gasping and pleading for my life, and they merely created a bit of sweat across the brow, nothing more.  Had I been hungrier, I could have had 6 more with no problems.  

The interior is definitely geared towards men, with gas pumps and neon signs and an actual Nascar hanging from the ceiling.  The exterior looks like an old time gas station.  I dont really care about that, all I care about is the next time I get to visit Madison and get to have more of those Atomic wings!"}
{"text":"The Chicken strips are outstanding. Had the Honey Jalapeño sauce which was pretty low on the hot scale but had a kick. Service was very good, ambience is very casual. The decor is awesome, old garage feel to it. Enough TVs available if you sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"I cannot believe there is not a review for Quaker Steak yet! I avoid chain restaurants like the plague, I don't like wings and I don't like racing yet I give this place 5 stars. That is how good it is. There are so many different choices for wing flavors that even I can find a flavor that I like. If you're not into wings they have a great \"regular\" menu that you can order from....and all the sides are great, especially the onion rings."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Bloody Mary but the twisty straw had a small hole--no suction. I asked for another, which also malfunctioned. When I got the third it arrived straight and I was asked not to twist it. As if. Lettuce 1/5. Waiter was wonderful. Playlist: top notch."}
{"text":"In the past this place was great. Lately though, things are falling apart. While waiting for the food, i took the kids to play some video games. The server dropped off the food, but no napkins and no utensils. I had to go to the front to ask for them. My burger came with about six fries. Hello? Fries are CHEAP, so why scrimp there? She never came back to refill drinks. When she asked if we wanted dessert, I had to point out that the kids meals come with popsicles, to which she said \"oh\". When the server came back with my change, there was no receipt, and the change was $2 short, so who knows if she even rang it up. 

The food was pretty cold too. 

I wish I could have my $40 back and go to a place that gives a S about return business. I just ate my last meal there."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Quaker Steak and Lube. My sister lives in Euclid and I was in the area visiting. She told me she knew this great place where we could get lunch and somne drinks so I was very excited since we don't have any Quaker Steaks in michigan where I\"m from. Upon walking in there were about 4 hostess up at the host stand having a conversation about something and did not even acknowledge that we were there after about a minute of them still continuing their conversation I basically had to greet myself and interrupt their conversation. Then the hostess asked us if it was okay if we sat \"halfway inbetween\" what the hell does that mean? Since I'd never been there I had no idea. Turns out it was the inside/outside area but we had a fun time calling it the halfway inbetween room haha. 
Our waiter was nice but I think he was newer. He took our drink orders and then 10 minutes later after we should of already had our drinks he came back over to double check what we had ordered. Eventually we got our drinks which were good. It actually was a really good Long Island. We ordered the four wheeler as an appetizer and he took our lunch order along with it. Then he did the same thing again....at about the time our appetizer was supposed to come out he came over and said \"you guys ordered the four wheeler right?!\" Are you kidding me? Then he also asked us again what we ordered for our lunches. So everything ended up coming out at once, our appetizer, and the rest of our food. Which I really hate. 

The food was just okay. I didn't ordered the wings and neither did anyone else at my table. Needless to say the service was ABSOLUTELY terrible and I've spent quite a few years of my life waiting tables so I like to think I\"m pretty easy going about these things....but it was just awful. If I\"m ever in the are aagain I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this four stars. But. The lunch buffet has definitely gone downhill over the years. The variety was decent, yet the food was still the same. Something I did like was that the wing sauce with no longer on the wings. It was on the side.  They boast of a craft beer selection however, there was only one craft beer on the menu. To me, blue moon and Yuengling are not craft beers even though they say they are. The server was very knowledgeable friendly polite and pretty good. For service they get a five star rating. The lack of a craft beer selection which is boasted about in the drink menu and the quality of the food on the lunch buffet is why I am giving it a three star."}
{"text":"I want to give this a higher rating, as the food is really good. The service is lacking though! Each time that I have been to this location my husband and I were seated at a small table rather than being asked if we would prefer a booth or table, and the service was very slow. The last time we went, once the food was served the server never came back over to check to make sure the food was what we expected until we were almost done eating. I had to get up and walk completely across the room to find a table with Ketchup and any other condiments that were needed at our own table. 

I will go back just because the food was good...but i don't think the service will ever get any better..."}
{"text":"***Quaker Steak & Lube features chicken wings that are similar to what you would get at a fast food chain or a run-of-the-mill sports bar; considering that there is a lot of lousy stadium and amusement park food out there, an order of chicken wings at Quaker Steak & Lube is an okay option for ballpark food***

Quaker Steak & Lube is a local chain specializing in chicken wings.  This location is inside PNC Park and it features both their chicken wings and their boneless wings.  The chicken wings can be drenched in various sauces including hot, ranch, Asian sesame, and so on.  I opted for the hot.  The chicken wings were okay.  There was no breading on the outside, but the deep fried skin was somewhat crispy.  The chicken meat was moist.  The sauce had some heat to it, but it was not overwhelmingly spicy.

I did not try their other food offerings, but I think they have french fries and a few other things.

Service was quick.

Prices were high (like other concession stands).  They offer several sizes of wings, but even their small portion is a large portion.

Quaker Steak & Lube is not a bad option for ballpark food even though the wings were messy.  The chicken wings were hot and fresh and were similar to what you would find at fast food joints or a run-of-the-mill sports bar.  While similar to fast food might not seem like a huge compliment, there is definitely a lot of stadium or amusement park food stands out there (see Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, CA) that are not even producing food at that standard.

Quaker Steak & Lube is located within PNC Park so it is only available to baseball game attendees.  Parking around the stadium is expensive though you can find parking very close to the stadium at $15."}
{"text":"I ordered the supersize single order of bone-in hot wings (Medium Buffalo & Haute Parm sauces) and an order of lube chips. I ordered the same thing about a month and a half ago and was sorely disappointed - somehow I came crawling back to get Quaker a chance to redeem itself. Sadly, it was an even worse order of food. The wings were very dry ( not much sauce at all) and the only thing even close to being like sauce was the grease at the bottom of the dish - there was definitely way more grease than wing sauce. Now for the lube chips - they were burnt and not worth eating. So sad because I like wings and I have always tolerated mediocre and average wings - these were far worse than that. I think this was enough to convince me to steer clear for good."}
{"text":"Go for the lunch buffet if they still have it.  Avoid buckets of wings, we've ordered buckets and got few drumsticks on top the rest flat meatless goo skin wads below.  Hamburgers not bad but extremely $$ for what you get.  Louisiana Licker sauce is excellent. The hot napkins are a cool thing if they still do that.  Was a neat place in 1999.  Impressed that it's still there."}
{"text":"I frequented Quaker Steak in Columbus, loved the food and service.  Wish i could say the same for Sheffield.  First time in was July 2nd, walked in around 2:00 for late lunch.  Greeted by a very nice hostess.  She was going to seat us on one side but we asked to sit on the bar side as there were a lot of kids on the other side.  As we were getting seated the waitress/bartender (i assume) came running over and started complaining about putting us in her section.  It was unprofessional.  I felt sorry for the hostess who told the crab that she would take care of us.  We opted to move to the bar but after a few minutes we decided to leave as the attitude of the waitress completely soured us on staying.  Was really looking forward to wings but that person really soured us on Quaker Steak.  I dont understand how that type of behavior is tolerated, she did it right in front of us.  Then we watched her stalking through her section, i don't recall ever seeing anyone one in the service industry, especially waitstaff, act like that in front of the customer.   The hostess was very apologetic as we left but assured her it wasn't her fault, we told her we were leaving as we didn't feel comfortable staying given our \"welcome\""}
{"text":"It's a ok place to eat. Menu is always changing. Would eat there again while waiting on the movie start"}
{"text":"OMG! Best wings USA, indeed! With about 26 different flavored wings.

I am almost speechless, this place has the tastiest wings I've had in my lifetime. I can honestly say that these guys know wings. 
The restaurant and service was great. I had ordered 5 of the following: ranch, smoky gold bbq, asian sesame and the golden garlic wings, and yes they were all delicious and very much gone in like no time at all. Paired with a refreshing local lager (Yuengling) and you can't go wrong. I'm going to miss this place."}
{"text":"This place apparently serves non-wing related food. If you want a review on that, look elsewhere. For me, this place is all about the wings. 

Wings are not hard to make, and I like them in a wide variety of styles: naked (just deep fried with no breading or anything), breaded, or even lightly battered (although naked is probably best I think). Yet so many places screw up the simple recipe of \"fry wings till crispy, toss with sauce, serve\". Quaker gets it right. 

First, the wings are good sized and have always been consistently well cooked - crispy on the outside but still juicy in the middle. None of those tiny, overcooked pigeon sized wings that places like Buffalo Wild Wings serve. Second, the sauces are great. If you want your stero typical \"hot wings\", well, you're still going to have to be more specific, because there are a variety of heat levels - mild, medium, hot, supercharged and atomic. Unlike a lot of wing places, Quaker manages to make sauces that are hot, yet still TASTE GOOD! So many crappy wing joints think its all about heat and forget flavor - not here. Finally, a wing place needs character and Quaker has that down pat. Housed in an old gas station, you have a quirky, fun, lively atmosphere from the building, the staff and the patrons. 

I would give this place 5 stars, but that fifth star is on hold right now. They have a (supposedly) ridiculously hot Triple Atomic sauce challenge. I've avoided doing it, because so many times I have taken a \"spicy food challenge\" at a wing or bbq place and found that the sauce is just horrible. Bitter, hot without even being spicy - like gargling pepper spray. My next trip to Quaker will be to try the Triple Atomic. If it is as good as the rest of their sauces, I will give them 5 stars without hesitation, and they shall be crowned \"Kings of All Wings\", there will be rejoicing in the streets, and peace shall reign on Earth."}
{"text":"I love the wings they are just as good as my hometown one in PA.  I had the best anywhere there and missed them terribly after moving to Ohio.  I lived near the original Quaker Steak in Sharon, PA."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations, which were pretty low. I figured it would be below average bar food. It was actually a bit above average, I'd say. They have a separate vegetarian menu (ask for it if you need it) with healthier selections. It's definitely not a favorite but I'm okay with getting it sometimes to mix things up and not go to other places too much. It would also be a great place to watch any game because there are tons of TVs!"}
{"text":"Well I had visited the Lube last February and had a great time with friends.  Wings were cooked to perfection, service was flawless and joked around with us.  We were there for a few hours.  Could the same experience happen again?    Had a gift card and decided to try the lunch buffet since it has been at least two years since my last visit for it.

Waitress was friendly and attentive.  Excellent.  Then we walked to the buffet which is now 11.00 per person.  Options included: salad, French onion soup, hot dogs, pasta, meatballs, popcorn chicken, rice, boneless wings, and wings.  No fries, no additional entrees.  Desert options looked pathetic. They only had four wing sauce options to dip your wings in.  Why only these four?  Wings were very dry to begin with.   It was essentially the Charlie Brown Christmas tree of lunch buffets.  You would have thought they were going out of business with the pathetic spread they displayed.

Waitress was good.  It's a shame how they decimated this lunch option.  It used to be excellent and now this.  I've been on the fringe of not returning multiple times over the last few years.  I think this finally cut the cord.  Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Love this place. When I was here before we always came here for Friday night happy hour... 

I flew back into town Friday night and met up with 6 of my friends here for dinner around 7... it was too hot to eat outside,  but there was a happy group of people enjoying the outside area and bar....

Our group of 6 turned to 8,then ended up of a party of 10... they were very accommodating and have plenty of room to seat us... separate checks and all...

I ordered some appetizers... fried pickels... YUMMY... and others got the pretzels..always a favorite.  I ordered my ususal the wings and magna fries...wings parmesean peppercorn and fries loaded with cheese and bacon... yum  yum. 

My little nephew had mac and cheese (double it up please) and since a 5 year old scarfed it down, i would tend to think it was good.

I have tried all ranges of the several wings sauses that they had... and i pretty much liked all of them... i couldn't hang with the Atomic wings...  but I am sure some of  you can.

In the summer i know that they have Bike night..in the past it was on Wednesday nights, not sure of the date now...  This place can get quite busy  but is a fun atmosphere that is great for family eats or friend treats!! 

We dont have one of these in California by me so I crave it and get my fix whenever I come to Ohio...

PS ,.. personally i didn't like the buffets, but i like my wings well done and just made...so it may be ok with you,... especially if you want to try some different flavors"}
{"text":"Great place to go. We went on all you can eat wing night so the place was busy but we thought that the service was still good. They let us change our wing flavor which was good."}
{"text":"Great service food was delicious the bartender Chad is amazing great service fast definitely knows what he is doing"}
{"text":"Love that there is a quaker steak in the airport!  The people were very friendly and attentive.  I had a wrap and onion rings wile I waited for my flight.  The food was fast and tasty.  They have outlets in some seats so you an recharge while you are waiting.  Great drink specials!  I would return to this location!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. They say they are open until 11. We arrived at 10:38 and were told the kitchen was closed. We did get a delicious dinner at Monk's a couple of blocks away, they served us and their kitchen was open until 11."}
{"text":"Awful, the worst meal I've had this year.  

I ordered medium rare strip steak, which was mushy (had it been frozen?) and tasteless, and underdone.  It came with two sides. I asked for french fries, well done; they were also undercooked and limp; and broccoli, which was steamed until it was falling apart.

I found the restaurant unpleasant to be in.  There was a very loud football game playing, which wouldn't have bothered me so much if there hadn't been very loud background music also playing.  

Total cost was $18.16 plus tip."}
{"text":"Great food. Shelly our server was very nice. Food hot and fast. Hostess was not very pleasant and didn't even smile. But we will be back."}
{"text":"The quality is really going down the tubes. Menu changes are in my opinion, mistakes. Portions are smaller and is evident that it is not about pleasing customers and more about the bottom line. If you're a new customer, you'll probably be satisfied. If you're a regular customer or returning customer, prepare for disappointment. I sent corporate an email and got no response, so I'm turning to help."}
{"text":"Do you know what it's like to lose all of your front teeth due to a terrible childhood dentist who told you that, and I quote, \"Sometimes gums just bleed?\"

Well, it sucks.  But the relevant suckage here is this: 

I cannot eat chicken wings.  

So while people here rhapsodize about the wings, all I can tell you is that if you remove the wings, you get a third-rate chain restaurant that serves bone-dry baked potatoes, sandwiches that have been seemingly shipped here straight from the Quaker Steak Sandwich-making factory somewhere in Boise, and processed stuff of all sorts.  

Is it terrible?  No.  The best thing about Quaker Steak and Lube is that it's within walking distance of the gigantic digital-screen movieplex, and it's slightly not as terrible than the godawful Hoggie's, which is like eating dried awful.  Which means that when you're looking for a place to go after the movie and laugh and discuss how good (or bad) the movie was, this place has beer, and tables, and food that's not going to challenge anyone's palate in ANY way.  

That's not made of evil.  That does not make it good.  But it is not likely to slaughter the innocents. 

But hey!  Maybe those wings make it five stars."}
{"text":"I particularly like this location. The service is decent and the food is good. In fact, this past time, the food had stepped it up a notch, so they totally get 4 stars. The only thing I have to say in the no so good column is that it can be very cold in the building, and people tend to let their kids run around like wild animals. The latter issue is hardly the fault of Quaker Steak & Lube. Parents, you're on notice. Get your kids under control. 
I got boneless wings..the grilled ones and they were tasty. My brother, mom and aunt got the bone in ones. I was jealous. Next time, I am getting those! 
Service was just okay. They had one person in our section and though it wasn't terribly busy, she wasn't terribly motivated. Maybe the screaming banshee children kept her from the section? Not sure.
I'll go again, and I hope next time I can just sit at the bar, have some wings and a beer and chill.  ;)"}
{"text":"We had a discount for this place from our hotel and it was within walking distance. The food was good. Great drinks. My favorite part was the oversized beer pong outside. A great time overall!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend  and I recently heard about the new Quaker Steak and Lube  that had opened in Lakewood. Both being avid  wing lovers, we decided to take our out of town guest to enjoy what we so enjoy, Quaker wings! They were so happy and satisfied with both taste and service that they took some back to their home to enjoy later. My boyfriend and I were so happy to introduce someone new to the excellent service and taste of Quaker wings. You all made our experience great! We can not wait to come back and enjoy more."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to town I hit this place.  The selection of wing sauces is great.  Buckeye BBQ is one of my tops.  I also had there lunch buffet before which I enjoyed.  I liked when the waitress stated if there was not a wing flavor on the buffet let her know and she will make sure we get what we wanted.  Beer and drink prices are just like any other bar.  

I would have to say that each time I am in town I will come here at least once a trip."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube always fails to impress me with their food. I always want to give the wings a chance, but anytime I get them the meat is extremely dry and the sauce is extra sticky...much more sticky than you think any wing sauce should be. For awhile I was just chalking this up to a wing night thing since they have to get wings out fast at a high volume. But I recently went here when it wasn't wing night and got wings and they were just as dry and sticky.  

Yesterday I went here with the whole family for dinner after a Pirates game and thought I'd try something other than wings. I got the cheesesteak...and it was not good. The meat was extremely dry and it reminded me of having cheesesteaks at my high school cafeteria. I also split some onion rings with the rest of the table...and at least those were very good. 

Despite my disappointment in the food, I do have to say the service was really good yesterday. I was with my finace's family, which included 11 adults and 6 children. The 6 children were a little more hyped up than usual. We had one server and she did a fantastic job taking care of our table. She got all of our orders correct and was continually filling up our drinks. She even brought out some extra coloring placemats, and veggies with ranch dip to keep the kids occupied while we waited for our food.

Unfortunately I've given up on getting a delicious meal here. If you really want good wings Buffalo Wild Wings is right up the street."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube has been a favorite of mine for some time now.  Unfortunately the local \"Lube\" in Pleasant Hills, PA has been closed for a while.  The good news is that when given the opportunity to visit another location I definitely do!  The Independence location offered up an perfectly prepared \"Lube Burger\" with everything.  Everything includes American Cheese, Bacon, Hot Sauce, & Mushrooms.  A side of dusted mango-habanero wings with carrots, celery and Ranch dressing rounded out the meal.  In my opinion QSL has the best burgers and wings out there."}
{"text":"QSL was a last resort for us since neighboring restaurants were jam packed. we got what we expected as far as the food went. Wings are pretty good in size, but the sauces were so-so. I ordered the Sriracha and Thai r crackers. Not as spicy as advertised. Atmosphere is quite loud, but what you'd expect from a place with overwhelming decor. Our server Chewy was fantastic however. He made accommodations for our son which worked out really well. Lots of big TVs which makes it a great place to watch a game. Definitely want to try the giant lube tube beers though!"}
{"text":"This place is for dudes.  
In the nicest way, I am not into cars, bikes, wings, or sports as much as the rest of you are, and that's just fine by me.  
Every time I have visited Quaker Steak and Lube, the men in my life find this place exciting; the memorabilia, the menu, the WINGS, the beer, the sauce list....  So if you're looking to take your boyfriend or hubby out for somewhere he'll like, then take him here.
I've been for lunch, dinner, and bike night (Wednesday).  There's guys in jeans, dress pants, leather chaps and they all get into this place like no girl will.
Wings, boneless wings, breaded wings, grilled boneless wings, saucy wings, tangy wings, thai spicy wings, bbq sweet wings, buckets of wings and wingy wings.  We had an amazing burger, something southwestern sounding with jalapeno's, slaw, black beans, cheddar cheese and sour cream.  The waiter said it was his favorite and my hubby agrees he'll be back for another one. 

Outside patio is nice but the smokers catch me off guard every time.

Bike night is an interesting event, good live bands, lots of chrome, leather, and excellent people watching.  Don't expect to be seated or get your food right away if you're there in the midst of the event.  We waited for over 45 minutes for our food.  Hang out, drink a beer and take it all in."}
{"text":"Stopped by during our visit to western PA and was not disappointed.  We were just looking for a quick happy hour stop for a few appetizers and tried the Bangin' Drums and soft pretzel sticks. Three large drumsticks slathered in your choice of sauce is definitely more like a meal than an appetizer! The pretzel sticks were overly salted but you could brush it off. The only disappointment with my Duck, Duck, Goose beverage was that my little duckie wouldn't float (was he drunk before he got to the table?)."}
{"text":"I just tried the drive thru yesterday.  I was told my order would be ready by 7.   Arrived and was told my order was almost ready.   25 minutes later a random dude comes out and pushes my bag of food at me and says the kitchen screwed up.   

A manager should have handled this and comped part of my large order.   

Very poor service.   

Sad for a local place we USED to frequent."}
{"text":"Food is extremely expensive for bar food. Over one dollar per wing and 10 plus dollar lunch sandwiches. Be ready to spend 20 dollars per person after food, drink, tax and tip for average bar food."}
{"text":"The reason for our visit was the wings.  While ordering our lunch we were told we couldn't order the \"crazy\" hot wings right away.  We had to order up, meaning we had to start with the mild and work our way up.  The boys (my husband and brother-in-law) did just that, but noot till after signing a waver.  After all of this, they didn't even think the wings were that hot.

Meanwhile I had to watch my family eat thier lunch because their was a mix-up in the back causing my food to be ordered after everyone at the table got their food.  The manager was nice enought to credit the bill for my lunch though.  

I can see how this place would be good for the college crowd, with the bar, pool table and karoke, but for a family I think I'll just stick to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Their GM John is terrible at handling mistakes, which happen a lot from the personal feedback I received after my bad experience.  I will never go back.  There are plenty of local businesses that treat their customers with more respect and hire better leaders."}
{"text":"I like Quaker Steak & Lube. I really do. The food is tasty and they have awesome wings. Their wing sauce options can't be beat. There's a great happy hour program, especially their all day Sunday happy hour. They give you free Twizzlers at the end of your meal. The pricing is very fair. The atmosphere is fun. So, you may be wondering why I've rated them the way I have.

The answer would be the extremely slow service. 

It is near impossible have lunch here during the a weekday if you're on any sort of schedule. We've tried that, several times.

There's not a lack of wait staff. That's the easy part. It takes no time at all to get your drinks ordered. It takes no time at all to place your order.

Just wait for the food to come. Then wait. Then wait some more. The kitchen runs at a snail's pace.

The strange thing is, on weekends or in the evening, this isn't a problem. And , that's what gets me. On a weekend, I can take my time. For dinner, I can take my time. 

For a weekday lunch, it is honestly better to find somewhere else, unless you don't have to be back at work anytime soon. 

I will keep coming back, just not when I'm on a schedule. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The wings here are the best anywhere...I am here for the lunch buffet, and its good, but nowhere near the quality of there Valley View location..Less selection and all the good items are slow to be replenished..Bartender is nice."}
{"text":"Good chicken wings in downtown Madison? Really? ...To be honest, I never actually thought about it. Prior to the arrival of this small-time chain to downtown Madison, all we had by way of decent wings was Buffalo Wild Wings. And I wouldn't even think of setting foot in that place ever again, because \"decent\" is a huge overstatement.

You're getting a lot more than that at Quaker Steak & Lube. The boneless chicken wings, for example, set a standard for chicken wings that I've never tasted before. The outside is fried to a perfect crispy texture that manages to avoid falling into that trap of being chewy and fatty, while still transcending your traditional fried chicken coating. 

There's a variety of interesting sauces to try at this place, and since you can mix any number of them at no additional charge, there's no way you could run out of things to try. I decided to venture 6 wings with a combination of their spicy Arizona Ranch sauce and their less-spicy Pineapple Rum sauce. The combination resulted in something that smelled and tasted 10 times better than I could have ever possibly expected. 

However, the spiciness was pitifully weak. With Arizona Ranch being ranked as having the highest Scoville rating of their medium-range sauces, I can't help but wonder just how spicy they can make a wing. In their defense, I didn't care to try the Atomic Sauce lest it taste like melted pennies (I'm looking at you, Blazin' Sauce), but I still want a burn if I'm getting the next-highest thing.

I got some onion rings on the side as well, and while I wasn't expecting much, these are the best onion rings I have had in a long long time. Normally I receive floppy onion rings that automatically sort and separate themselves into chewy onion and broken, brittle breading the second I take a bite. But these onion rings managed to retain their texture and taste damn good in the process. Onion and all, it gives a nice crunch. Quaker Steak & Lube's onion rings are essentially the onion version of good steak-cut french fries.

I do take issue with the prices here. All that and a cheap domestic beer cost me around 15 bucks after tax and tip. For a small batch of boneless wings, you're paying over a dollar a wing. And you can't just buy wings in bulk, since they won't let you pick more than one sauce/mix for a larger amount. In this respect, Quaker Steak & Lube is performing just as poorly as B-Dub's. But at least at this place, I can at least feel slightly more justified in paying exorbitant amounts of money for delicious fried chicken."}
{"text":"One of the great strengths of this location is the daily lunch buffet... there are rotating entrees available daily and all you can eat wings from the kitchen."}
{"text":"New staff seems much better than my previous review, so I felt the need to update. I've been here several times recently for the unlimited wings, and I've been pleased enough to return. Bar service gets a little slow when they get slammed, but no worse than anywhere else. The experience has been positive enough to earn a re-review."}
{"text":"First off, understand that this is not health food.

It is greasy bar food.  Fries, wings, etc.   With that frame of reference, that is, as far as greasy bar food goes, it is good and consistent.   I've never had food from QSL that I didn't enjoy eating.  It tastes like real food (don't laugh, not all restaurant food does!), and leaves you feeling like you've eaten real food (as opposed to physically stuffed but still craving nourishment).  

The service is hit or miss, and that's fine with me in a place like this.  The servers tend to be genuine;  if they are taking a while to come around, it's probably because they have a lot of tables to manage, not for any negative reason.

Of course, the only reason that many people go to a QSL is for some kind of car show.  And I thank QSL for creating such a venue.

Keep it up, Quaker Steak!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place.

The hostess was very nice, but beyond that things went downhill...

- The waitress seemed to be overly flustered and kept giving apologies/excuses about being so busy (sorry, I can't help)

- They didn't bring out what I ordered (actually, they gave me more than what I ordered and I had to make sure I wasn't going to be charged - they ended up letting me keep the extra wings - so mixed on this point, but it could have equally been a screw up for the worst)

- Even though I ended up with some extra boneless wings they just weren't that good.

Overall, not impressed and there is little to nothing which would bring me back."}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants where my kids like several items on the menu. It's nice that they have a games section for the kids to be entertained while we wait for our food as well."}
{"text":"Uhhmm, no.
They aren't wings, they're CHICKEN NUGGETS. They come drowning in sauce, so be sure to ask for it on the side.
Although our server was decent, the hostess was less than professional.
It was very noisy, and the menus were sticky.
I won't be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, if it weren't for their TVs and the fact that it's closer to our place than Buffalo Wild Wings, I'd never come here.

It's not that this place is bad, per se, but it's basically an inferior version of the Buffalo Wild Wings on University, The food isn't as good, the beer not as diverse, and the deals not as good. The atmosphere also isn't as bro-y as Buffalo Wild Wings, which is usually a good thing, except for Football Sundays. 

I usually feel completely at home screaming \"@(#@( YEEEAAH!\" after my favorite team gets a touchdown at Buffalo Wild Wings, but at this place, I'm pretty sure people just think I'm wasted."}
{"text":"The burgers are a little above average, but hey, this place is clearly a wingplace. I had the all you can eat wings on tuesday for around 11 bucks, it was definitely worth it! The wings came with one side of fries and you can ask for carrots or celery everytime you order more wings. I would say there are about 20 different wing flavor choices, from mild to very spicy(so spicy that you have to sign a waiver before trying them). To try these extremely spicy wings, however, you must work your way up the ladder of spiciness(which lists the scoville units for each flavor). I would not recommend the premium garlic wings, very overpowering flavor, unless you eat entire cloves on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo platter with added ribs and $1 up charge for the loaded fries.  Everything was warm; the wings were nice and meaty too. The ribs were excellent, best around the area. Service was pretty good, waiter was pretty attentive but got a little off track in the end.  It wasn't a huge deal because we were all talking and having a good time.  The caramel apple dessert was really good."}
{"text":"Stopped on 4th of July cause parking lot was empty so I figured I'd get good food & fast service. Nope. Came in and sat down at the outside bar. Took almost 10 mins to get a water and menu. Prices are a little high on menu. So after another 10 min wait I ask the girl if I can order. I ordered the LubeBurger w which is a burger w bacon, mushroom, hot sauce, cheese & fries for $10.49. I ordered no pink w a side of Arizona ranch instead of blu cheese that comes with it. The burger came out pretty quick. No Arizona ranch on the side. Turns out it was on the burger instead of on side. Which is no big deal but the burger was real pink and I said no pink. Once my side of Arizona ranch came out I was done w the 9 fries I had on my plate. For 10.49 you should get a good amount of fries not 9. I heard people complaining they were getting warm beers. Get your shit together Quaker...."}
{"text":"Stranded in the airport for over 4 hours last month and this place was a port in the storm. They were closing, but fired up the grill for us anyway and continued to serve us even though it was getting late. I had some sort of basket of crispy chicken fingers--food was good and they were quick with the drinks. The two servers that night were just fantastic- Pat & Brian (I am pretty sure that is right, anyway). VERY courteous, helpful and accommodating on a night that was pretty miserable but made much more tolerable because of this place. Five starts for service and good old fashioned manners and kindness."}
{"text":"Food was good. Boneless grilled wings were tender and tasty. Loaded fries are good. Service was slow and the wait staff appeared to be confused on tables. Very loud and tough to have a conversation. We went for a cruise in. The have a great outdoor space.  Food better than service.  Went to Buffalo Wild Wings next day and that was better.  Boneless fried/breaded wings are dry, but the boneless skinless were ok.  Tender, just had a swipe of bbq sauce on them."}
{"text":"BBQ ribs: A+
Mild WIngs: C-
Takeout service at the bar: OK, just took about 5 min for someone to notice I was standing there. Once they got my order in the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"I won't say Quaker Steak & Lube GAVE the BF food poisoning. That would go against the scientist I was trained to be. What I will say is that there is a correlation between us eating dinner there Thursday night and the BF having food poisoning Friday morning. Correlation doesn't equal causation, but it does equal us not going back.

Possible illness aside, the sauce was very vinegary, the boneless wings were disturbingly dense, & about half of the regular wings had broken bones. Also, apparently Thursday night is karaoke night, which means pleas from the \"DJ\" every 15-20 minutes for people to sign up or request that he sing something.

I like hot wings way more than the next person, but I think I'll be getting them elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped in this location while visiting Pittsburgh. It was pretty much like the one here in Columbus, but I would have to say the food in Columbus was a little better.

Staff was nice and quick with drink refills.

Nothing that stood out."}
{"text":"Sat at the outside patio and served by Diamond. She was a good and efficient waitress.  I got the Cobb Salad and hubby got the wedge with the triple atomic challenge.  Of course he dusted those wings off in less than 4 minutes.  He's a pro.  My salad was super fresh and awesome.   No complaints at all.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it may sound trivial but in the ad for the wing challenge, it says it INCLUDES a t-shirt for completing the meal and she said the shirt was $2.  I stated the ad said it was INCLUDED and she went to \"check with the manager\" then came back to charge $1 for the shirt.  I didn't think this is right but it was whatever.   Anyway - good food and good service.    That's all that really mattered.  I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Service poor.  I couldn't get a seat at the bar despite the fact that several chairs were not populated by people.  These 2 ladies wouldn't move their bags despite me lurking right behind them!  Bartender eventually said go sit by the window. 

Barback walked up to me and said NOTHING.  Just looked at me.  After a few awkward seconds I said \"yes\"?  (He was clearly way too young to be a bartender.). He didn't reapond so I said \"I just wanted to order a beverage\".  

He:  OK. 
me:  um, Titos and Cranberry
he: turns around yells across the bar to bartender \"she wants a titos and cranberry\" and just walks away. 

Bartender brings over drink herself.  Sets it down. Walks away.  No greeting, nothing. 

But a woman beside me said \"excuse me, can we get a table?\"
Bartender:  just go sit down.  We will get to you in a few minutes\"

Ugh!  If I hadn't already had my drink I would have walked out.  Rude staff, rude customers.  Crying shame this is the only bar in B Concourse."}
{"text":"So far not so impressive here at Quaker steak and lube. When I got out of the car I was hyped to experience the history of the place. The motorcycles and cars hanging from the ceiling was a plus. We were quickly seated even tho the pirates were playing. Our server however wasn't that great. She took our order and brought our drinks quickly and then disappeared for the next 15 minutes. The manager made a table touch with us which was very pleasant and then the food came. It was ok bt as far as best wings in pittsburgh they need to step it up. 
However I will come back just to try it again."}
{"text":"What can I say about quaker state and lube that is not already indicated by their 3 star review. Despite being warned, I though hey, it was on man vs food, how bad could it be right?....wrong. I pulled up to the drive through with a couple of friends, mouth watering for some of these wings I've heard so much about. We placed the order giddy with excitement. Got the boneless wings, 10 min later sped home to enjoy them. When I opened the container I was greeted by something that resembled a mutated chicken nugget with some kind of red sauce haphazardly drizzled on. I took a bite only to be surprised by the soggy breading and some kind of rubbery substance within. I look over to my friend to see what he thinks of his food, only to find out that he had gotten wrong order, also not
pleased by the taste. I reach over to carrots provided to wash the taste out of my mouth, they are slimy, rotten. A sad moment to say the least, don't believe the hype, save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Usually, I don't review chains. But I had to share my experience of absolutely horrible service here. 

I've been here before, always at about 3:00 and the service has always been \"meh.\" Drinks unceremoniously plopped on the table, waitresses acting like they really have better things to be doing than taking your order, and taking nearly half an hour between appetizer orders and dinner orders. But the wings are good, and I'm a pretty laid back type of girl, so usually, it doesn't matter. 

My beau and I stopped here for a quick bite after an early movie at about 2:35. We figured we'd have enough time to eat before I had to scurry off to my mid shift job. We had about an hour and 20 minutes to eat, so we didn't think it would be an issue. 

Issue number 1: Apparently, there was a bike night thing happening that night, so they roped off the  entire parking lot and half the movie theater's lot. A little much, if you ask me. So when we drove up at 2:35, and asked where to park, and the \"attendant\" said that said we were not allowed to park in their lot and we had to park and walk. This lot was completely empty, ladies and gentleman. Empty. 1 pickup truck was not going to make or break the parking situation at 2:35 on a Wednesday afternoon. But fine. Whatever.

Issue number 2: We were seated right away in the bar. We were the only people in this lady's section. It took her almost 15 minutes to notice us. When we told her that we had to leave by 3:00, she kind of huffed and took our drink order.10 minutes later, soda's came, wrong sodas. I don't know how she got sprite out 2 orders for diet coke, but again, whatever, two laid back people, trying to have a good time.

Issue number 3: Took our appetizer order 20 minutes after the drink orders came out. We were sitting there with closed menus in front of us and she just scurried off after plopping our drinks down heavily on the table and ran off. 20 minutes after that, pretzels came out. We ordered quesadillas. Again, laid back. I'm calm. 

Issue number 4: We open our mouths to order our wings and off she goes AGAIN. 10 minutes later, she takes our plate with half a pretzel still on it! I stopped her this time \"Can we please order our wings now?\" the response I got? \"Just a minute\" I'm usually not this forward, but I said, \"No, now. And make them to go please. We have to leave by 3:00.\" She huffs, plops the pretzel basket back down, I take the last pretzel half off of it, and we give our orders. She brings our wings, at exactly 3:00. Took her sweet time giving us our check, 10 minutes later. I'm officially going to be late. I take the wings to work. 

Issue number 5: Open the wings, at my lunch break, wrong wings. 

Never coming here again unless someone else is paying for it. I will not spend money here again."}
{"text":"I need to get out to this place more often. I'm a big fan of decent wings, and they really do have some of the better wings around. Good salads. Haven't tried their burgers, but I've heard good things. 

Their wing challenge is pretty intense. I've been successful and had my name placed on the wall. It is quite the accomplishment.

The first time you get out here, you'll find their decor impressive. It definitely attracts people. The service is ok, I've had better. Fairly on the slower side. Prices are a little higher for the type of food, but like I said, it's fairly quality and you get a decent amount for the money."}
{"text":"I didn't go in to Quaker Steak and Lube expecting much more than some good wings. What I got, surprised me. A spectacular level of service, with my soda never getting near empty before it was refilled, delicious wings, and a friendly staff. I am rarely surprised for the better when stopping in for this style of food, but this was one of those rare times."}
{"text":"Last night for Wi vs Az basketball game I had gray wings and observed great bar tending by 2 female bar tenders. One trainer and one trainee.  Would have given a 4 or 5 star rating, but went back in today for Mi vs UK and the male bar tender  was terrible. put in wrong order for my wings and pretty sure he didn't give me the correct beer.  Tried to tell him but he didn't understand.  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here for lunch, especially when the weather allows you to eat outside.  The lunch buffet is different each day of the week.  Plenty to choose from and all you can eat."}
{"text":"Beer, wings, sports on multiple TV's, a decent menu with predictable choices.  Quaker Steak and Lube delivers on what they present.  

Its a big busy place, with good service.  The beer selection was not extensive, but the food choices were.  I really enjoyed their Southwest BBQ chicken flatbread."}
{"text":"I gave the Cobb salad with breaded tenders (special ordered) a try.  The salad greens were delicious.  They rectified their freshness issue.  I now have a new place to go for lunch salads!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this more than one star is because the beer wasn't warm. I had three drinks and the manager gave me my bill and a stick of lickerish and told me to have a nice evening. Was gonna order food but I decided to go to The Pub to eat. I sat at the counter looking out the window and read. Not sure why they rushed me out, but they won't have to do it again because the odds of me going to another Quaker steak and lube are slim to none."}
{"text":"Love love love the food. Love the service.great place to meat friends and hang out. Took grandkids there they loved it."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant - unique decor and good food. Wings are crispy and all the sauces that I've tried, I've liked. They sell them to go as well which is great so you can make wings at home with their flavorful sauces."}
{"text":"***Lunch Buffett***

WHY BOTHER???


You bill yourself as Pittsburgh and Western PA's premier spot for wings and I've had them at the Original location and at several of my local bars so I just had to try out your buffet.  WHY OH WHY do you only have 'naked' wings on your buffet???  I asked the waitress if I was able to get any sauces and she said, \"They're listed here on the 'basket tissue', would you like me to get you a side of one of them?\"  SAY WHAT???  ONE of them?  How do I know which one(s) I should come back for?  Why don't you have several types of sauced wings on your buffet???  I'm sure you do all kinds of market research and you can very easily narrow down the fav sauces at each restaurant and put a few of those on your buffet, Right?  Oh, you don't want the crispy wings to get soggy?  Then AT LEAST put sauces on the buffet!  And for a wing place- why do you have popcorn shrimp & clams on your buffet?  Burgers swimming in au jus?  And to charge $11.99 for it?  Are you serious?  Have you been to Golden Corral?  $8.99 for their buffet and there's a ton of options!  Now- I understand you are positioning your restaurant way above GC, but GC has wings on their buffet and they're almost as good.  I know I should have voiced my displeasure with my server or manager but I knew it would have stopped there.  This buffet is a disgrace and quite honestly- it doesn't put the rest of the menu in a very good light if this was someone's first visit.  I think you need to either completely revamp the buffet or do away with it completely, because if not, WHY BOTHER?    

Reading other comments- there weren't any Boneless Wings on this buffet, there weren't any Onion Rings...!"}
{"text":"Food is good Quaker Steak & Lube food.
However tattoo heaven has slow service during lunch buffet I guess waitresses are unnecessary and tips well they are unnecessary too - still think Austintown and Sharon are the best QS&Ls around for the lunch buffet"}
{"text":"It's my third time eating from/at Quaker Steak & Lube, I've eaten at the Madison location, taken out from the Middleton spot and this time I sat at the Middleton location. It was pretty empty, but it was the day after Christmas. People still were in family mode and staying in from what I could tell.

I was excited to order some boneless wings, nothing like knowing what you want before you go in! I tried a Custom Built Combo - Loaded Magna Fries and 6 pack of wings (original BBQ) and six more wings with Dusted Chipotle BBQ. I don't typically order dry rubs for wings or ribs (I know that's a popular Southern way). When they came out, the 'dusted' wings were hands down my favorite. I will go back again just to have those wings in that dusting.

The fries were good, initially, but as I got the remaining fries at the bottom, they became dry and less enjoyable. The service felt under-attentive, knowing how empty the place was, we were surprised to hear their trivia consoles were all out. We also sat waiting for refills a little long - especially after he came and asked if we wanted refills.

When I got to my second to last wing, I thought 'wow, this is a big wing!' ...it wasn't a wing. In fact, I had no idea what it was (at the time). First bite - not a wing. Second bite - nothing but pepper (spit into napkin). I pointed it out to the waiter, not because I wanted something free or a new meal (I was full and got my money's worth). But I was really curious what it was.

As we were getting up to leave the manager rushed out with a free 6 pack of wings as an apology (again, not what I needed, but it was well welcomed). Turns out it was breading... nothing but breading. Yeah, that explains what I tasted. He had also never seen that happen before - so don't worry - it shouldn't happen to you.

Overall, a great gimmick restaurant with the play on their name and the decor in each location. I won't be going out of my way to visit the Middleton location again, but the downtown Madison location is a great spot. I'll stick to that one from here on out!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited Quaker Steak it was fantastic.  The bucket 'o wings was tasty, the wings were larger than other similar places, and the sauces were better too.  Over the years though, I've visited several more times and the quality is steadily decreasing.  The wings seem smaller and the sauces more bland.  And sometimes they are slimy rather than crispy.  Bad.  All of the rest of the food is typical, so if the wings aren't special there's not much to differentiate from any other restaurant in the category.

The service has become borderline terrible.  The tables are often dirty. Their staff take a long time to get back to the table, and don't check in very often.  This is a big place; if your server doesn't come back you are pretty much out of luck if you have a request.  The last time I was there I felt that my drink pour was small, so I asked the waitress about it.  A couple minutes later the manager comes to the table, and I figure \"oh cool, she's going to fix it for me.\"  She fixed it alright.  She pulled out a measuring cup, poured my drink into it to show me it was correct, poured it back into my glass and left.  My wife and I just sat there, mouths agape, unable to process what the heck just happened.  I mean, I've never experienced anything like that.  We still joke about it.  It's like a Saturday Night Live skit or something.  Who does that?

Quaker Steak has ultra-cool decor and they hold a lot of special events that keep it on my list.  If it wasn't for that I'd never return.  It's a gimmick restaurant where you can see bike night, car shows, and Madison County.  Beyond that it's not worth the time."}
{"text":"I love going here for some greasy food! Only reason I'm giving four stars is because they don't have coco cola products but anyways really cool decor and 3 star service"}
{"text":"Don't ever go to their lunch time buffet. It is terrible. The food was cold & the waitress did not remember my husband's coffee until alm ost we were done with our meal. The lunch menu was wings which I did not eat, roast beef which was tough to chew, the desserts totally stunk with their custard that was hot instead of being cold. It was not hot outside either. The only thing that they have going for themselves is the salad bar. Who wants to go to a buffet just for a salad. We expect more then just a salad. The quality of food was absolutely terrible. WE WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT FOR A LUNCH BEFFET AGAIN!!!!! Don't waste your money on this place.  Order off the menu instead you will be alsot happier that you did."}
{"text":"Really great staff and food is consistent. I fly southwest a lot so this is my normal stop for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday (1/12/13) for dinner and was extremely disappointed... in the FOOD.  The service was pretty good- we had a waitress named Taylor and she did a good job keeping our drinks full and letting us know what the hold up was in the kitchen.  The place wasn't busy but it took over an hour for our food to come out.  My wife ordered a Flatbread sandwich and there must have been an issue with it, cause the rest of us ordered chicken.  Those that ordered wings were disappointed in the size of the wings and the temp (they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for a half hour- they were soggy) and I ordered 'Boneless wings' that the waitress said '...were looking VERY good'.  Well, they came out and they were nothing more than McDonalds type white meat chicken nuggets.  They were BORING!  They certainly were NOT the type of chicken that made this place famous!  As another 'poster' said, we will be sticking to our local bars for wing night from now 
on..."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 40 mins yesterday for some food that was horrible and not prepared right. Waited another 15 mins to talk to a manager. Server said she couldn't find him. Ended up leaving without even eating. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place.  It is not the fanciest place in the world.  But if you are in the mood for good wings, ribs, and other good 'ol Americana food then you are in a treat here.  The place looks like an old fashioned gas station outside and comes complete with a race car.  There are some arcade games inside and enough motorcycles, pieces of cars, license plates, etc. etc. to stock at least a Jay Leno hangar.  If you enjoy any of the above stuff you should enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Not a fan, not terrible, but not great either. Service here is mixed and food is average. Good for novelty, but little else."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is the pits!
Wings sit for hours and no love put into making anything.
You can order fresh wings but it takes forever to get them.
Everything is kinda dumped into a trough for everyone to eat out of.

Handed the money & bill over after eating 6 nasty wings and waiting for fresh ones that never came.

Ended up at a Italian shop for lunch that day after paying for a buffet I did not get.

Never going back."}
{"text":"I have only been here a hand full of times seem understaffed at times but the food is always good love the wing flavors. I feel like I'm waiting for my food for a long time."}
{"text":"Wings were great spicy and service was excellent at lunch. The onion rings are far better at Hoggy's next door."}
{"text":"We have these where i grew up and I was suprized yo see one this far west. Food is always good. The atomsphere screams biker or grease monkey. I had a luburger and it was pretty good however, I could not finnish it. All in all pretty good meal"}
{"text":"While I normally would shy away from anything called \"Lube Chips\", cause, you know, it's got the word \"Lube\" in it. And imaging something like a \"Lube Chip\" in my 7th grade-like mind just doesn't sound right.  

But they're actually good.  

For that matter, the whole restaurant is good.  Plus they have a car mounted sideways on the wall.  Seriously.  It's solidly hung too.  I checked.  It's not going anywhere.

What I appreciate is unlike other wing-establishments of their kind, their sauce names actually line up to their heat.  If you order a medium hot sauce, it's not mild nor hot.  Their Arizona Ranch sauce is a spectacular mix of medium-ish sauce with ranch dressing.  

For entrees, I'm a fan of the wrap and my wife has actually gotten the steak a couple of times.  She was pleased.

The adult beverages are reasonably priced and a good selection too.  

Service has always been good for me.  

Now I'm thinking I am going to go there after work.  See what writing this review has done for me?"}
{"text":"This is a Pittsburgh institution...actually a Western PA institution since it originated in Sharon, PA.

The wings are fantastic every time! On Friday, 6/7/2013, I had Louisiana Lickers & Cajan. If you like wings, this is the place to come. Even if you are in the mood for something else, everything else is great on the menu especially the Magna Fries!!!

Service was great on Friday night, as always. And the Pittsburgh atmosphere is perfect for any Yinzer!!"}
{"text":"Inside the terminal at A gates.  Grabbing a breakfast before boarding. Service was quick. Meal was just what you'd expect of airport breakfast :) I was the only one in the place this early (630 am) but I didn't mind the quiet."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube was my go-to place for wings in Madison. I'll admit, I never had anything other than wings here, and that would continue to be the trend whenever I'm back in the area.

If you're up for it, Tuesdays are the days to go here. $13 for all-you-can-eat wings and I must praise the wings for their quality. I love how Quaker Steak & Lube has a lot of flavors and seasonings for their wings. I'd say between 20-25. I believe they implemented new dry rubs within the past year or so and they were pretty good.

Overall, superior wings and good atmosphere, bar, and lots of TVs."}
{"text":"We were looking for dinner on a Friday night in Pleasant Hills and dismayed at the lines of people and long waits at our favorite eateries.  Quaker Steak & Lube was able to seat our party of four (with two children) in less than five minutes.  The service was friendly, and the menu was extensive.  The food we ordered was all served fast, hot, and tasty.  The bratwurst chili and buffalo mac & cheese were both delicious variations on these classics.  The bone-in traditional wings, in original BBQ, were crispy and well-sauced.  There were lots of bonuses for kids, including a fun children's menu, a prize wheel, a \"learn the Chicken Dance\"  tutorial, and lots of interesting décor to look at. We would go there again!"}
{"text":"a bar with beer to go. thats money in my book."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak is a fun place to go for lunch or dinner, especially if you feel like going to a movie afterwards.  When you first walk in, there are all kinds of vehicle-inspired decorations to look at while waiting for a table.  On the day we went, a Tuesday, there was a large buffet set up that included wings, pasta, fries, pizza, and all kinds of other delicious-smelling dishes.  We opted to order from the menu, but if there was more time to just enjoy the buffet, I totally would have gone for that option!  My macaroni and cheeseburger was delicious and I had the homemade kettle chips on the side... perfectly salted and crunchy (who likes soggy chips??).  The service was fast and super friendly, and I will definitely be coming back for the wings and more chips :)"}
{"text":"Went here last month with family on a week night. The service was horrible. It took half an hour for beers when the restaurant was less than a third of the way full. Appetizers were missing and the meals took another 45 minutes after that. For 8 of us we didn't get out for over two hours. To top it all off, we were all very sick that night from something we had there. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Beer was wings spot, but you can't really mess up a 32 oz draft. Got the combo plate: Grilled boneless  which were basically sliced chicken breasts drizzled with sauce on top of cut up pita. This was super weird as the sauce from the chicken lightly dripped on the pita. The chicken was alright, but I really was expecting the them to be tossed in sauce rather than drizzled. The pretzel bites were OK but obviously pre-frozen of some sorts and not fresh. Queso cheese tasted off, but probably from a can. Staff was friendly and our waitress was actually pretty funny. Good for beer and that's about it."}
{"text":"First time to go here and pleasantly surprised. Great theme carried through the decor and menu. Had a great salad, excellent service from Justin. Would love to go back and try the wings, beer and burgers!"}
{"text":"So this is a review only of the Tuesday buffet wings.

Quaker steak has been a favorite of mine, from Cleveland to Pittsburgh. The flavor variety is impressive and every once in awhile they cycle in some new flavors. Not too bad given they don't HAVE to do that!

This is the best location in the near-Pittsburgh area (of the two....). Each of the three times I've gone, wings taste like they were made when we ordered, they were plump and juicy, flavors were intense, and they came quickly. Didn't seem like they were sitting around nor taking forever. Dry rubs were dry, glazes were crispy, sauces were wet. Just like it's supposed to be!

And at least for the times I've been, the wings are not sitting around in a buffet line pre-made (like some other places or like the photos suggest). They are brought to you when you order.

{"text":"So this is a review only of the Tuesday buffet wings.

Quaker steak has been a favorite of mine, from Cleveland to Pittsburgh. The flavor variety is impressive and every once in awhile they cycle in some new flavors. Not too bad given they don't HAVE to do that!

So specifically for this location, I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because our server brought out the wrong flavor several times. She also brought out the wings literally in like 30 seconds..... which lets me know that they weren't made for our order, they were siting around waiting to be served. I mean, I ate them anyway because hey, basically all the flavors taste good, but I let her know that it is strange to get several orders that aren't what we requested.

Anyway, the wings here definitely are good. And if you're in the area it's not a bad choice. I live in Pittsburgh and am equidistant from the Robinson location which seems to have fresher preparation. I don't hold location against this place since it serves the folks in the region. But if you're deciding between the two, go to Robinson area (or consult my list below).

The kitchen was very slow, enough to make us think twice in the future"}
{"text":"This Quaker Steak & Lube is located near exit 59 on 376 in the Summit in Robinson between Chick-fil-A and Citizen's Bank.

I've never been to Quaker Steak but I've seen it many times.  The first time I've seen one was in Erie near the Peach Street exit.

This place is essentially a sports bar and it's kind of a like a man cave.  Large screen tv's, sports memorabilia, and all sort of food to go along with beer seems to be geared towards the sports enthusiasts and seems like a great place to watch a game.

The menu has many choices from nachos, burgers, and other sharing plates and entrees but if I'm not mistaken they're probably best known for their wings.  

My wife wanted to get the pretzels but I didn't want 4 so I noticed that 2 came with a single order of hot wings in a combo.  I ended up ordering two extra pounds of wings as well which were Cajun and garlic Parmesan.  I had also ordered loaded fries on the side which were completely covered in melted cheese topped with chives and bacon.

The wings were large, probably roaster size and all were sauced accordingly.  I was looking to see if they had any dry rub type wings but it seemed all were sauced.  The sauce really defined the wings since it didn't seem there was any extra besides the shreds of cheese on the garlic Parm ones.  The hot wings were perfect heat though.  Any hotter would have been good too but for me, not necessary.  I really like the bite of the Cajun ones and the garlic Parm ones had a nice savory taste.

The wings themselves although large were cooked thoroughly.  Sometimes when you get big wings they aren't cooked \"well done\" but these were hot and steamy with the sauce basically acting as the \"lube\".

This is a great place for the wings and beer type of crowd and I'd most certainly go back to get more variety of wings.  The more the merrier, to get a good variety come with more people."}
{"text":"I had been ordering to go from The Lube on Thursdays for the past few months because of the rib special.  Unfortunately, my last 2 orders of ribs were burned not charred.  I complained to a manager 2 wks ago and he vowed to mail me a gift card after providing pictures of my food. I skipped a week of getting take out waiting for my gift card and did not receive it. Well I gave it another try last night and was disappointed again. This time I complained to a manager (I think his name was Brian and he is the area manager?).  This guy was great he apologized and will compensated me with a gift card well over my food order that I paid for earlier in the evening.  The previous manager never followed through to send out my gift card.  I am very confident that this area manager will see to it that I receive compensation for both meals. I just want to encourage all of you to give The Lube a 2nd 3rd and many more chances.  Their food is usually very pleasing to the pallet.

This is an update pertaining to the above:
Brian sent an email to thank me for contacting them about my concerns.  He also assured me he put the gift cards in the mail.  After my next visit I will write another review about my experience. I also want to say thanks again to Brian."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch found out they had a 10.00 buffet it had wings,vrggies,pizza,salad bar,chips,teo soups and stuffed prppers. The place was.clean and the place was all around good. The server was.great and the sweet tea was awsome"}
{"text":"The sauce that comes with their onion rings is the nastiest thing I have ever tasted... Like seriously, whoever said \"Hey, this shit taste good, let's throw it on the menu\", needs to get fired asap.

Just add ranch on the side, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I love the QS&L in Concord. The wait staff is great and very accomadating. Have never had any issues there. The Pineville location is so terrbile. They have ghetto fabulous written all over it. The wait staff walks aroung like they are lost and have nothing to do. The wait staff are dressed in the uniforms but they look sloppy. They charge extra for every little thing you ask for. The wings are so drenched in sauce they are soggy by the time they get to your table. We waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our table and in the end we had to grab a waiter. The worse experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I will make the drive to Concord for the better experience. I do not recommend Pineville location. Go to Concord."}
{"text":"I usually stop in for breafast or lunch when at CLE because the food is decent. Only 3 stars this visit because the waitress i had was such a sour puss - older female with short salt and pepper hair. She actually made my food less enjoyable. Impatient with a bad attitude does not make for good service. As I was leaving and she was taking another order, she had the nerve to glance at the tip I left - as if she earned it. Good help is so very hard to find.
There is another waitress that is quiet but friendly with a braid. I can work with her."}
{"text":"Loud, obnoxious place.  Service was sooo slow.  Food passable.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Stopped last night for something quick after a ballgame.  Decided to eat outside since it was a nice evening.  Once the hostess took us to our seats NO ONE came to wait on us.  Finally the hostess came back over & offered to get us drinks & apologized for no one acknowledging us.  Brought us the drinks & said our waiter/waitress would be over.  There was a waiter at a table near us but was busy conversing with the woman & child at the table & never even looked at us.  Was he supposed to be our waiter???? who knows.  The hostess returned & said she'd get our drinks & kept apologizing.  The hostess, Taylor, was very nice & took our order & ended up taking care of us the entire time.  Not ever knowing who was to wait on us (the name Joseph was on our receipt but not sure if he was the person who ignored us or just the name on the receipt from where Taylor rang us up).  First time this has happened to us & we thanked Taylor for stepping up ~ she was most pleasant!"}
{"text":"Considered 3 stars because it's a cheesy chain but really didn't have a legit reason. 

The beer selection was decent, the menu has a bit of everything and really the wings were pretty damn good. Not small like BWW. You actually get a chicken wing (parts). The flavors are maybe a bit overwhelming. Wish I could have tried more of them. Had the fried pickles because I love fried stuff and for spears that were great!! 

The waitress was friendly and had some recommendations. The wait wasn't long but it wasn't super busy either. I'll have to go back on Tuesdays for all you can eat wings!!!"}
{"text":"When I get in the mood for something, I eat it once, and I'm usually satisfied. Twice if it's good. For the last few weeks, I've really been wanting a good, tasty wing. Something crisp with a good sauce and bite to it. Since it's on the way home from my office, the future wife said \"Let's go to Quaker Steak. They're supposed to have great wings.\"

Two stars later, color me disappointed in my first attempt to satisfy my craving. Take heed, those who operate chain restaurants, and for that matter, any restaurants: Yes, bacon is good. Cheese is good as well. Can we please have an option where if someone just wants some fries, they can just have the fries? I want to dip a fry in ketchup, maybe some ranch. If I want Bacon Cheddar Double Death Fries, I'll ask for Bacon Cheddar Double Death Fries, okay? If I say \"I'd like a side of fries,\" don't turn into an internet meme, froth at the mouth and tell me the virtues of your Double Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger Taco Pita Double Tripled Death Fries. 

On to the wings. Holy moly, these were not great wings. My favorite wing isn't the one that looks like a drumstick, but rather the one that looks like your forearm, with the two bones. Mmmm, that's the greatest part of the wing. Most of mine were broken, and one even had the bone sticking out. Just the thing I want to bite into and subsequently choke on, which I thankfully did not. The sauces were just mediocre. Golden garlic was neither spicy nor garlic, neither Duran nor Duran. Discuss.

Also: Unless you're a dive bar trying to attract people into your fledgling establishment, you don't need a 32oz. beer. It's irresponsible to your beer suppliers who designed beers to be drank within a temperature window, as well as the poor saps who see a small aquarium's worth of beer and figure it's a good deal. 

All in all, I'm sure Quaker Steak is a fine establishment. Maybe I went on a bad, bad day for cook and staff alike. I doubt I'll give them a chance to make up for it, however."}
{"text":"Just average place to eat. The loaded nachos were the best. The chicken wigs were a little soggy. The boneless wings were very salty. Great TV's though."}
{"text":"What a waste of close to $30. I love the QS&L in Valley View, so I was pumped when one opened closer to home. I should not have bothered. 

First problem was the insanely long wait just to get a drink order. My Jawbone UP24 buzzed from inactivity while waiting to order drinks. Once our drink order was in, I got another buzz waiting for the food to come. My Jawbone buzzes every 30 minutes I'm not up moving, so this experience was over an hour. The order was also not complicated: salad and sandwich. The place was not busy. 

I was sitting right in front of a server station, so I got to experience all the stressed out servers complaining about how much they hate their jobs. That was pretty entertaining. I also got to see how much food they scrape off the plates into the trash. It's an extreme amount. 

The second problem was the food. I normally eat the wings, but one time I had the boneless wings salad and it was awesome. This time, not so much. The lettuce was shredded to a coleslaw-like consistency. It was not enjoyable. The chicken strips on top were good, but I had no knife from the server to cut the chicken strips up to mix them into the salad. Salad is much tastier when you mix in the chicken to eat with the veggies. This didn't happen. I don't remember if the lettuce was shredded last time, but I was eating it at work, so I probably just shoveled it into my mouth as fast as possible last time. This time, I was out for leisure and looking for a pleasant salad. 

My mom tried something new for her. She had the cheese steak. I'm pretty sure it was a Steak-Um for the meat. It had no flavor, was a weird color. The cheese and peppers on top were not melted or cooked. So flavorless meat, kinda cooked mushrooms, topped with raw red pepper and cold cheese. Ick. It was gross. 

The best part of the meal were my mom's French fries. Those were tasty. My water was also pleasant. My mom said the Twizzlers are very fresh and good. So that's a plus. 

Will I return for the wings? No. I feel scammed out of my money with horrible quality food this time. My dad loved QS&L, he used to eat at the original all the time. Today is the four year anniversary of his sudden passing. I guess I was looking for the atmosphere of this place to remind me of my dad. The Camaro helped. I liked looking at the Camaro. But had the food and service been good, I think I would be a happier person. Also, my dad would yell at me if I wasted more money here. I will only be back if I get a gift card or something."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful, even brought out a basket of chips and a sample of sauces.  

And though I'm not a traditionalist I'd consider myself a wings snob and these wings were great! Our favorites were the Arizona Ranch and Parmesan Pepper."}
{"text":"I have never ever been to a Quaker Steak and Lube before but it was different than what  I expected. The place was large and crowded but kind of reminded me of a BW3 in it's layout. The AC didn't seem to be working so well but that could have been because it was literally 200 degrees outside with a relative humidity of 88%. This led to the bathroom floor being like a skating rink which is never a good thing when you have been drinking a few beers. If I fell I would have had to strip down and just throw out all my clothes because god knows what was on the floor.

They have a large selection of food and I went with the pretzel and wing combo yeah that's right big fluffy salty pretzels and wings. Does it really get any better than that? Secondly they have Yeungling on tap but it's Pittsburgh if someone didn't have it on tap I would be upset. The wings were tasty the cheese dipping sauce for the pretzels spicy and the beer was cold.

The service was good even though the girl we had must have had the whole back of the restaurant including the bar by herself. They have plenty of parking available and lots of TV's even though the Pirates Cardinals game wasn't on but our waitress fixed that problem. I would go back to one if I ever saw one again."}
{"text":"The other reviews are right on and this place has the most excellent wings around.  They are plenty spicy and hot and cooked beyond perfection.  YES BEYOND PERFECTION!  The service is great, it's always clean and the place is just friendly.  If you are a gearhead this is a must."}
{"text":"Food is bad and service is bad. Takes forever to get anything. The only good thing they have is onion rings."}
{"text":"Been a pro user with this chain for over 20 years. 

Went there last night for all you can eat. Got there at 6:45, table seated for 6. After waiting for 25+ minutes,c and seeing countless tables not being bussed (cleaned), I started to worry.  
Finally seated at 7:15 PM, we waited to place our order with our server.  After taking our drink order, those of us who got the buffet, headed up to get our food.   Several minutes later we got our drinks.   After a couple of trips to the main food bar, I went back in to that room looking for desserts, of which nothing was labeled, and there were five little plates of some sort of slice of cake.  It turns out it was strawberry shortcake.
Now having eaten here many times over the years, I was perplexed by the lack of desserts.  I additionally noticed, that some of the same tables were still not bussed. 

I called our waitress over, and I asked her about the desserts.  So she went over and brought back four of the little plates with the strawberry shortcake.  And I asked her is there anything other than this for dessert?   She did not know.  I said \"can you get me the manager?\"  

Once he arrived at the table he also mentioned the strawberry shortcake. After several minutes, I asked him don't you have any pudding or any of the other desserts you normally have out?  He said, \"if they're not out there we  probably don't have them\", as if he didn't know.  I found that I odd, as a manager that you wouldn't know. 

In any case, the wings were soggy, and the choices limited, not just the desserts but other things in addition to the wings on the buffet. 

Everybody has off days, but I also noticed the new flyer on the wall stating all you can eat wings $15.99. Now the flyer in the bathroom stated all you can eat wings $13.99. Not to mention, the email I received the day before, stating all you can eat wings $13.99.  
The managers response to the $13.99, was that BW3, a competitor made a deal with the wing supplier to pay more money & therefor QS&L would have to charge more for their wings now.  It made no sense to anyone of the six of us at the table.   I don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"used to be great. after yesterday I give up. SLOOOOOOOW almost non existent service. Cold food. had to practically beg for every part of our meal. Don't waste your money
."}
{"text":"This should be obvious...finding good food in an airport is a tough job to begin with...but this is Awful. Food is awful-boneless chicken bites taste like old oil, the chicken inside is bizarrely colored, and the sauce tastes like butter. Gambled and lost!!

Wine is fine, beer a little dlat....damn those delayed flights."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. Way over priced for what you get, more like a kids plate portion. Ordered the nachos, the cheese sauce was COLD, by far not even warm, the portion size was a joke, very small. 
Also got the baja wrap! Harris teeter in the deli section makes a much better wrap at half the price. I choose French fries as my side and there wasn't enough to fill up a 4 year old. Pretty sad! 
The waiter was very attentive and was hustling.  
When we left it was dark outside and there were no outside lights on anywhere. Couldn't see the steps to walk down them to get to the car. Looked like it was closed. 
Probably a good bet that I will never go there again. What a letdown."}
{"text":"I'm very undecided on this place. The last time we went there it was busy - and the service was terrible. I have been there before and had a better time. Good wings - great variety of sauce choices. Don't even try the hottest sauce . . . I've eaten very hot before - but their top sauce shouldn't even be served. Very nasty - very hot - very dangerous. I hear the place is great on 'bike night' which I believe is TUESDAYS. I wouldn't know since I don't have a motorcycle. If you don't either - I would stay away on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Was there last night for Bike Week.  Decided to go in an order dinner.  The Burger was good.  However, the service was pathetic.  It took over 20-minutes to get a beer and over 30-minutes for our meal to arrive.  The staff seemed to be in chaos and others seemingly didn't care.  Very disorganized.  Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!!!  QS & L Airport was just the restaurant we needed to relax and have fun before our long travels!!  Loved the atmosphere, and  the server, Brian was awesome!!!  Definitely will be returning to this restaurant on all of our trips to the burgh!!"}
{"text":"Wings = 5 stars.  Everything else = 3 or 4 stars.  Not a bad place to have a meal, and the waitresses are typically pretty good looking.  But what you really want to do is come in the evening and have some drinks and a bucket of wings with friends.

I just wish they had Quaker Steak & Lube everywhere."}
{"text":"The food is consistent like and Quaker steak. So it's pretty good. Service is terrible! All the bartender are miserable, act like they don't want to serve you, complain, and come right out and say they don't want to make margaritas for customers. This is an airport! People are coming/going to work or coming/going on vacation! We don't expect miserable, half ass service! Clean house and get cheerful staff."}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday to have lunch. The service (Tony) was excellent and the food was very good.."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed in the food at Quaker steak and lube.  The novelty of the building and decor wore off quickly when our food came out. Our waitress was friendly and attentive but her smile could not make up for the flavorless burger I ordered with half cooked bacon and brick hard onion rings. My sons boneless chicken wings were mushy and flavorless. He couldn't eat them so my husband had a try and said that they tasted premade out of a freeze bag. Nasty. When the manager asked how our meal was he cut me off quickly when I attempted to bring the wings to his attention. Jerome you were rude and obviously don't care what shit you are serving your customers. Luckily our family was just traveling through town and will never ever set foot in this place again. The two stars are for the wait staff being friendly and the French fries being the only things my family actually liked here."}
{"text":"Arrived about 9:30 and learned that the appetizers are half price after 9pm. Food is always good. If you want a good server, ask for Jeffrey - he is the best!"}
{"text":"Food flavor is fair. Typical bar food, but the car show made it a destination. It was great to see all the old cars and enjoy the summer weather while enjoying a drink with friends outside.  It was time well spent."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised when I really enjoyed the food and the shakes. Great job. Def recommend people to come here."}
{"text":"Service was marginal at best. Wings where okay. Clean establishment and as always plenty of things to look at. If you've never been to quaker steak and lube this is a nice one to try but other than okay wings not much to eat here. Pricey as well."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not that I would go out of my way for this food. My first visit overall was average."}
{"text":"If I reviewed years ago would of five starred. One less for service. We had the bartender/waiter one night and he never came to table. That was while ago, last few times waitress just seemed stressed and talking crap for tips...really, then improve your service. We go for all you can eat wings, don't think we're done after the first ten wings! Bring more drinks...get better tip. I've ordered drink and never got to table. Still best wings around though...bw3 is not as good!"}
{"text":"Typical bar food experience.  I opted for wings and fries this trip, along with a new-to-me beer choice. The beer selection could improve slightly, offering something more in between IPA and plain grocery store selections.  All in all, not a bad dinner outing.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Went here couple weeks ago on a Monday night. nobody greeted us at door and we sat at bar. employees were sitting at bar. I ordered a bucket of wings and my buddy ordered a soup. food took forever and the wings were terrible. they weren't even busy. wings weren't even a fresh order, they just re-dipped whatever they had left that day in the fryer. I don't see this restaurant lasting.

wont be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there earlier this evening and I can say all the comments about the service is true.  Absolutely brutal!  We were seated quickly, but after sitting at our table  for 10 minutes and not one server came by to take an order we gave up & left to find some other restaurant that valued our business. Trust me, go somewhere else.  We went to Monks across the street and received very attentive service."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak and Lube has the Best Wings that I have tasted in a long time. The wings are big, plump and Juicy. They are not the skimpy little things that they sell in most wing joints. 
C.R. had the Atomic wings. They actually make you sign a waiver before they will put in an order. They were hot, but nothing too severe. 
I had 10 of the Regular Hot wings. They were awesome. They were served with a generous helping of Celery and Blue Cheese. 
The service was wonderful, the decor was a NASCAR lovers dream. There was actually a exact Model of a Rusty Wallace car that was suspended over the Bar. 
My only complaint is that the Middleton, Wisconsin location is the closest one to Chicago. If they ever opened a location here, they would make a killing. It would blow any wing place in Chicago out of the water. 
If you are ever on the road and pass one of these gems, make sure to stop in. The wings are well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I love Quaker Steak and Lube. They have to be one of the best chicken wing joints out there. I've been to the one in Dayton, Ohio a number of times, but it's been a few years.

While in the Pittsburgh airport I saw they have a small setup here. It is the typical food setup for an airport so nothing really special. They do have counter service which can be fun. I had a short time, so ordered a small order of hot wings and a root beer. They serve their root beer bottled, so no refills. The wings took quite a while to arrive and the server was hard to find most of the time. The wings, however, were as good as the ones I remember in their full restaurant."}
{"text":"Over due but here it is. This is a really neat place. I love all the old car memorabilia. We  came here for a Santa brunch during christmas and I have to say that Santa had been on a diet and his beard could have smacked him in the face if it was pulled but it was a nice experience for Vince. 

The wings here are really good. We got the boneless ones and they were hot and fresh. They have something like 20 sauces to choose from so there's something for everyone. I had a mac and cheese burger which was ok. I just wish the mac was cheesier. The service was also just ok. I normally only get water and it sat empty for half the meal. I don't drink soda unless its with alcohol. 

This is a wing place and they do that we'll and if I come back ill stick to that."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak and Lube is little more than a chain restaurant that offers passable food. The wings (Buckeye bbq) were hardly the best I've ever had, or even on the top end of the scale. They were okay, but not spectacular. The kettle chips and beer cheese were quite good however, as were the nachos.

Stay away from the steak -- it appeared to have been frozen, with pre-made \"grill lines.\" Very disappointing to say the least. 

However, the service was genuinely excellent and the overall decor was fun."}
{"text":"Not at all what you expect from Quaker Steak. Surprised Quaker lets this place keep the franchise. First of it is inside the campus. No servers, you order the counter on your way in. I was there on a Saturday afternoon. They said today they were not serving beer. I asked to speak with the manager to see why they were not serving beer. A young fellow came over looked me in the eye and said \"She said no\"! I said are you kidding?! I really just like to speak with the manager. She finally came out and said the registers were down. I said I just paid for my wings right there. She said let me check. Came back and said OK $8 and I can get you 2 beers. Food took an hour to get and it was cold. We eat and drank our one beer each and left. NOT A TYPICAL LUBE! This is a college place to get wings for the dorm only."}
{"text":"We tried this location tonight and it was completely terrible.  I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich. It was disgusting.  The meat had bones all through it. I bit down and I an just glad I didn't break a tooth. There was almost no cheese and way too many mushrooms. It was warm at least.  The fries that came with it were ice cold. My husband ordered a rare 8oz steak. What came out was a tiny little hockey puck that had been cooked into shoe leather. It too came with cold fries. 
The worst part was the condescending attitude of the manager. She acted as though she didn't care and could hardly be bothered. She said they would take care of the check. We didn't eat anything at all. We will never bother with this restaurant again."}
{"text":"we eat here about every other week, great service and food.  prices seem to vary a lot in fact wait staff admitted, prices went up no reason; one week wings reduce $3 per 20 piece bone in wings due to competition better prices"}
{"text":"We had to literally just get up and leave the restaurant because a server never came to us. We waited after being seated and eventually had to go and ask the hostess to send our waitress over. She said she would send someone....We went to the table and continued to wait and nobody still came over. Not even for drinks or anything...We got up and said to the 4 people at the hostess stand including possibly the manager that we were walking over to another restaurant and they said ok and that was it. Ridiculous, anyone an serve water...doesn't have to be a Server, 4 hostess staff could have gotten a drink for a table if the servers were overwhelmed or at least apologized as we were leaving and tried to make it right. Once getting to oak barrel we found out this isn't the first time this has happened. People even left their Quaker pagers at oak barrel cause they went over there and decided to stay. Crazy. They were so careless. Very frustrated."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this airport bar/restaurant actually had really good wings! Lots of sauces to choose from and the wings were very crispy which I love. The two women bartending were very nice and attentive. I got the Thai flavor and Kentucky BBQ flavors - the Thai is supposedly a bit up on the heat scale but wasn't spicy at all. Nonetheless, they had good flavor. If this wing place had a location back where I live I'd definitely go!"}
{"text":"We used to go here weekly for years. Then the bar was redone, staff changed, prices went up, beer selection wasn't as good, trivia boards switched, fewer tvs had trivia, and...yes, the chicken wasn't the same. Seemed smaller and dryer.

After dozens of visits, it's like we lost an old friend.  Sad."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a good experience. The food was safe and I didn't get sick, despite believing that my server was not too aware of the gluten free menu and modifications. 

The manager (or assistant manager), on the other hand, was fantastic! When I asked for a GF menu, she accompanied my party to our table and proceeded to tell me that she was gluten free as well and that if I wanted GF fries to request them; apparently they make GF fries in a separate fryer. 

I didn't order fries, but I got the boneless chicken wings (no sauce) and steamed broccoli (without pita bread). My server made a note on my order that it was to be made GF and it came correct. The only reason I say she wasn't very with it when it came to the gluten free choices is that she asked what type of wing sauce I wanted when the menu clearly stated I couldn't have sauce. Had I not have read that for myself...yikes."}
{"text":"Meh. This place offers mediocre food, but a fun atmosphere. Looking for some great wings, I headed over the Quaker Steak and Lube after seeing it featured on Man V Food. Unfortunately, I was let down.

The wings are not the best. Not very crunchy, and a lot of chewy skin. The sauce left something to be desired as well. If you are looking for a chain with wings, BWW's is a better bet."}
{"text":"Twice a month I meet with my Grief Group for dinner and conversation at different eateries throughout town (we're a group of new friends who are each grieving the loss of a loved one; we first got together at the Cornerstone of Hope the summer of 2015). This week, the group decided to meet at Quaker Steak & Lube. I was not only thoroughly impressed with the friendliness of the staff (including our personable waitress, Desiree), but also with the presentation and taste of the food. (I ordered the pretzels and the chicken quesadillas to share as appetizers, and beef tacos and a small order of wings (since everyone recommended the wings).  What was most surprising and awesome, however, was how the restaurant handled a minor mistake with one of our party's order. She ordered her chicken regular grilled and, instead, they accidentally prepared it \"blackened\" - Desiree noticed this while the food was STILL in the kitchen. So, instead of serving it and having the guest send it back, she simply apologized to the member in our party, said it would be another 4 minutes to redo her order, and then offered her a FREE salad. On top of that,  when the manager brought out my friend's order, he said it was ON THE HOUSE because of the mistake!!!!  WOW!!! Phenomenal!  Very customer-centric. Very proactive. Very impressive! Who does that???!!!!  It's our new favorite meeting place!"}
{"text":"When my family and I got off our plane at the Southwest terminal we immediately spotted Quaker steak & lube and made a mental note of having dinner there before we left for home the following week. We entered QS&L around 5:30 P.M and since our plane didn't leave till 7 right across from the restaurant, we settled right in. When we got there they had only one other table occupied and we saw only one waitress. We knew what we wanted before sitting down so our orders were placed almost immediately as a couple other tables started to fill. Our food came out after about 10 minutes and as we ate I heard the waitress tell other tables that the kitchen was now closed and they were only serving drinks. Everything we ordered was correct (extra crispy) food was good and my wings, though not jumbo, were done perfectly with my Garlic sauce and Thaiasian combo. Service did seem a bit slow on drink refills and when I asked for a box for leftovers, well it just never came before I had to run off for my plane. Overall it was o.k, I guess just what you expect for an airport restaurant, Aloha"}
{"text":"I love to eat here because of the outdoor seating. It's quiet with a nice outdoor bar. I feel comfortable bringing my kids here, but can see coming with just adults too. Great variety of wings and a nice staff too.  Unlike most QS&Ls they do not deep fry the pretzels. I'm sure you can ask for them that way if you want. They also don't crisp the wings as much, so if you like yours crispy ask for it and they will be perfect."}
{"text":"Didnt even know this spot was here til I came across a Groupon offer.  Checked it out after catching The Amazing Spider-man movie and the service was great and the wings were yum....i stuck with the basic bbq sauce but have to say the fries taste better than the soft pretzels and will definitely frequent again....maybe during all you can eat wing night....lol"}
{"text":"Finally a place that has some real hot wings! Triple Atomic is awesome and will make you sweat. Reduced my rating because the beer selection could use some help. Lots of taps but not that great of selection for a town that has some really good micro-brews."}
{"text":"First off the wings are really great but as far as the rack of ribs I can say that 2 wings had more meat then the whole half rack of ribs. Beer selecting is ok as my server did not have a clue on local beers and such so she got me a beer menu. Server kept checking up on me which was great. Beware on the ribs. The selection of sauces and rubs are nice. Will came back but not order the ribs."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant, it's not the best, not the worst. Average. The food I would give 3 stars. The reason I am giving 2 stars is because the service. Our waitress started out pretty average. Once we got our food it started to go down hill. About 10 minutes after I started eating, I needed more ranch and my friend Jen needed more water. I noticed our waitress was just seating a table down from us, flirting with the 2 dudes she was serving. We let 10 minutes pass and she still didn't moved. I had to flag a different waitress down to get what we needed. Super bogus. Lesson learned stick to mom and pop restaurants for awesome 5 star food and 5 star service. Eat locally."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since opening. The menu has changed for the worse and the quality of the food can be questionable certain days."}
{"text":"We have been eating here on our way up north for 7 years... and in the past two years it has gone downhill. Saturday we were excited to go and it was wet carpeting smell, inattentive waiter, my  husband's margarita was very MEH and took FOREVER to get. It's a MIX...not handmade. And, the glass wasn't even filled. We almost dined and ditched. That's how bad the beginning was. The wings were not hot but still tasty. The Thai, Asian Sesame and garlic were good, but because of the musty wet smell we won't be back. 

Sadly."}
{"text":"I've been hear many times and wings are not bad.  The Buckeye BBQ sauce has a good kick and is very flavorful.  We attempted to visit the other night and were told there would be a short wait.  She didn't take our name so we just stood by the server stand.  A party of five came in behind us and were seated immediately in a booth.  I thought, \"OK, maybe they're saving the booths for larger parties and maybe they're just cleaning a table for us\".  Next another party of two came in and were seated in the booth right next to the party of 5.  I just looked at the hostess and told her to forget it and walked out."}
{"text":"Very cool decor (motorcycles hanging from the ceiling!), food came out quickly and was good (onion rings), wide selection of beer.  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  All in all recommended.

They have lots of specials (half-price appetizers, buffets, etc.) so check out the schedule for deals."}
{"text":"I should have done this one long ago, i would come faithfully on Tuesday for all you can eat wings. Always good, diffrent flavours for eveyone. I recently went back and the wings were still pretty good."}
{"text":"This may be one of the worst restaurants in the Concord area.   While the sign says that they have the \"Worlds Best Wings\", we found the wings to be tough and fatty with little meat.  The $4.00 per glass of lemondaid was flat.  While the pulled pork Bar B Q was average, the home chips came out soggy and loaded with cooking oil.  The service was poor as we had to ask for dinnerware three times.  Our drinks were empty most of the time during the dining experience.  I would pass on this one..."}
{"text":"Alright so my friends and i are definently wing entuhisasts to say the least

We go to wings suds and spuds, quaker steak and lube, buffalo wild wings, and julianos for wings

Obviously it depends on the mood that your in as to where we go (also the night) Now idk if they have changed how they did things (considering i havent been in the burgh since feburary because of the military) but anyways before i left quaker steak would have a lunch buffet every weekday and on the lunch buffet they would have their hot wings, and la lickers and i think one other flavor i think. Since my favorite flavor there is hot :) i usually try and go during the lunch buffet. 

On sundays they have a brunch buffet, which is really good also, on this they have the Arizona Ranch, which i like but my buddy doesnt, then again they also have la lickers and i think one other (usually they try and put a newer flavor out there, or even a flavor they are testing)

Obviously i think this place is known for the wing night, tuesdays. I believe its 12 bucks and you get all you can eat wings. Ive had both the bad servers and the extremely good servers during these nights, it just depends obviously. If you get a good server, youll be eating non stop for as long as you can eat. You get a bad server and you can be waiting a little while for refills on the wings.

Anyways my favorite flavors are:
there BBQ is good
the Golden Garlic is AMAZING
Hot is the sh*t
Arizona Ranch is good
the Parmasean Garlic isnt bad
the suicide taste like straight tabasco xP (gross)

They have a huge menu too if your not into the wings, but ive never gone there for anything but. Ive gotten the magna fries and theyre good stuff also.

Also atmosphere is A+ at all times :) mainly cause im a guy and i love ESPN on every TV

They were trying to promote theyre drive through and delivery service when i was leaving, i was pretty happy with the service"}
{"text":"Quaker Steak is known for their wings, but you are really missing out if you don't try some of their other menu selections. Their burgers are some of the better burgers I've had in chain restaurants and their ribs are really good too. My wife always gets this spicy rice and chicken bowl which is also very tasty.

As for the actual wings, they're fine but you can find better in the area. Of course if you are going on all you can eat wings night, it's definitely worth the value."}
{"text":"The boneless wings are alright, (only 6 little ones) but they are not wings they are nuggets covered in sauce. The soft pretzels for a side with them are good, with the beer cheese sauce. The service was poor, the waiter  took his time to get to the table, he never came back to ask about refills till he brought the bill. They have free wi-fi but it is useless. One positive was the burger and fries my wife got looked really good, and it was big."}
{"text":"For those health conscious people out there, don't shy away from Quaker Steak and Lube. Who knew that a \"wing place\" could have healthy options?! My husband and I ordered take out on Saturday night to take with us to the drive ins. We both ordered the grilled, boneless wings though he got the super single and I got the custom combo with magna fries. I know. It defeats the purpose of being healthy but I'm pregnant so I can live a little. The grilled, boneless wings come in any of their wing flavors and are served with pita bread and a cup of  toppings-tomatoes, lettuce and green onions. The grilled boneless wings are always flavorful and never dry. You're also given the option of having celery and carrots with ranch or cbue cheese for no additonal cost. 
My only issue with Quaker Steak and Lube has been their drive thru. Although this Saturday's drive thru interaction was pleasant and timely, in the past, I have not had such good luck. I always call ahead and wait 30 minutes before attempting to pick up my order through the drive thru window. However, if someone is in front of us at the drive thru, you can wait upwards of 15 minutes. No one ever pulls ahead, parks and waits for their food, in my experience. At times, my husband had to go into the restuarant and ask for our food. Defeats the purpose of having a drive thru window if peopel don't actually drive thru! I suggest if you are going to order take out and there is someone at the drive thru window, park and walk in to get your food. It will save you 15 minutes of waiting and becoming frustrated.  Bottom line- the food is worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Love the wings. The bbq spicy wings are awesome. The Cajun wings had too much spice rub. Overall, yummy and we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is just ok - even considering that it's intended to be a casual wing joint.  I get that, and I get that some casual wing joints can be really good.  This just isn't one of them.  

We were in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and this was my 2nd or 3rd time at this location since they opened a couple of years ago.  I ordered the boneless wings (crispy) and broccoli.  Should have gotten the wings grilled - they had too much breading and not quite enough sauce.   The regular wings were  a little better, they're big wings but were short on sauce.  The pricing seems a little out of line with other comparable wing places, and the wings here just aren't that great.

Finally - a warning to anyone considering eating these wings - our local grocery store started carrying bottled QSL sauces.  Out of curiosity one day I checked the nutritional information and it is BAD!  It's amazing how many calories they've been able to pack into those jars . . . just think about pouring the sauce over deep fried chicken . . ."}
{"text":"This was our last \"Man vs. Food\" stop in PGH during a visit with my fiance. Was impressed by the number of flavors they had for wing sauce, but wasnt too impressed with the wings themselves. Kind of small and overpriced. Could get better wings at a pub in AZ. My fiance did the wing challenge and was able to complete it. I ordered 1 of their hottest wings just to try it. First bite - okay hot, not too bad though. Second bite - that's HOT! Third - holy hell my mouth is on fire!! You definitely cannot go back and enjoy the other flavors if you try the hottest wings though. It's like they burn out your taste buds. Probably would come again next time we're in PGH because I love wings, but would come back during their specials."}
{"text":"This location is \"testing the waters\" and replacing the lunch buffet with a soup and salad bar. What a disappointment. I won't be back until the buffet is restored."}
{"text":"My dad and I have been going here for years. Used to love it. It's terrible now. Half the taps we're out. Oh and we got all you can eat wings, till they kept coming out cold. Oh and they knowingpy filled abroken lube tube and took it to the people KNOWING they wouldn't be able to tlget the beer because the handle was broken. I asked for a manager. And he didn't care one bit. Just hlgave us excuses and walked away. Been going here for years, but never again."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Quaker Steak & Lube, I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, it was delicious, the BBQ sauce had a nice kick to it. I also had a side of bourbon beans which really had a nice kick and left you wanting more. Also ordered BBQ wings original and the BBQ sauce was great, wings could've used a bit more meat though.

 Service was okay... The place was packed for a Tuesday night, I think people come here more or less for the environment as the food was good, just not good enough to write anything home about."}
{"text":"Always great wings. Prices are comparable to their other locations. No fear, the wings taste great too. Just as if you were in a full service location."}
{"text":"It's a good place to grab a quick bite and have a beer.  Their food is good and flavorful but I do feel like you should get a little more for the money.  I highly recommend their boom boom sauce, its by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever had in my life server did not bring drinks yo the table and we had to remind the server to bring the drinks to the table then our wings was given to the wrong people and she really looked as if she hated her job me and my family come here often and I do not think we will ever return the server absolutely does not make you feel welcomed at all and believe that they need more training and the know how to serve their  customers I think we will be going to bww instead sorry lube stop but the service has just became  shitty I am an ex certified chef who nows how a restaurant is supposed to run and my wife a server who has worked her way to a manager and we know service and this is not it and would give you a negative 3stars if possible food was good but then again it is about service"}
{"text":"If you call, make sure not you don't talk to Aaron Black, because he does NOT know they do not have ginger beer, which is required for a Moscow Mule - weak drinks"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go out and eat. Their is quite a bit to see when you sit down. From all the cars, vehicles, and other things they got hanging from the ceiling, or glued to the wall. It is normally really loud inside, which can get a bit bothersome when your trying to talk to friends or family, and it sucks when you get placed in the bar area, and some people can be very rude and careless (you can tell when their gettin' drunk) besides all that, their is a nice selection of food to choose from, and everything is great. Now, wings are not my thing but Quaker Steaks are pretty good. Although i will never push myself to try the Atomic sauce, because i hate hot... If you in the Madison/Middleton area and want some good food at a good price, you should check out Quaker Steak...."}
{"text":"Got an order to go and waited an hour for it. The wings were burnt and tasted disgusting. However, the lady was extremely apologetic and made sure my meal was gluten free, without contamination. The fries were good but, I may not be back because of the wait and inedible wings, though."}
{"text":"The hours say that they are open until 11. We walked in with a party of 8, at 9:55pm and were told that the kitchen already closed. I brought family from out of town who were really looking forward to eating there."}
{"text":"I eat at the original in Sharon about once a month, and have been going there for about 18 years now. I've ate at many franchised locations across Pa and Ohio, including Erie, Boardman, Altoona, Cranberry, and Bloomsburg. This one is by far the worst I've ever ate at. 

We went after a Pirates game because this location said online it was open until 1am... Only we were told after arriving they actually closed at 11. Not that big of a deal, we still had about an hour for all you can eat wings. The waitresses were beyond slow, the wings were old and tasted like they'd been under a heat lamp for hours, which the waitress basically admitted when they didn't have the flavors we wanted. At the original, they make the wings to order and they're always warm and delicious. We would have been further ahead ordering single orders of wings with as slow as the waitresses were, we could have gotten the flavors we wanted and it would have been a lot cheaper. The waitresses started asking if we wanted our check yet about 10 mins after we finally got our food, and we didn't get refills until we finally gave up on eating there and asked for the check. They then hovered waiting for us to leave, and a 18% tip was included into the check for their awful service. 

If you're going because you saw the lube on man vs food, drive up 79 and head west on 80 for about an hour and eat at the original and best location in Sharon. I'm not going back to this one for certain."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the service was really bad. We were given a pager and told to wait despite the fact that there were literally dozens of empty tables and there was no line. Really weird. Everything there seems pretty dirty."}
{"text":"I am a wing man, love the wings here, not always consistent but when they are right, they are RIGHT.  Crispy on the outside, flavorful on  sauces and fluffy tender on the inside.  Have not tried the psycho hot sauce in store, but got some to take home and enjoyed it. may brave it and get my name in the ledger one day."}
{"text":"A 3 not for the food, for the service, the server we had seemed unaware of priority. It took two or three times to get what you asked the server for, she was friendly but flighty. The alcohol was very good, I had gotten an Arnold Palmeresc drink to start my night off, then i went for a Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. My wife and daughter both got margaritas and the one got an alcoholic shake. Food was spot on, very tasty with the Tandoori mustard wing sauce."}
{"text":"My office decided to order carry out to celebrate a co-workers bday. This was my first experience with Quaker Steak and it was decent. There was an issue with timing and our lunch didn't turn up ready for nearly 45 minutes after it was promised. No reason really was given. Kinda odd. 

I had the wedge salad. The lettuce was nice crunchy iceberg. Not super green but I think that's iceberg lettuce for ya. You can choose grilled or fried chicken and I opted for the grilled. It had nice flavor and was real chicken. The bacon was not the greatest quality and lacked flavor. The bleu cheese on the other hand had great flavor and came in size big chunks :) the star was the avocado lime dressing. It had a bit of a kick to it and was delish! Sign me up for more of that. I can't say I'd ever seek out a visit to this place on my own but not too shabby for takeout lunch. Others in the office had the wings in various flavors and formats. Most of them were very pleased."}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself in Madison, Wisconsin, I always set aside enough time to drive over to Middleton and eat at Quaker Steak &  Lube. I've had wings all across the country, and I always compare them to QS&L's wings. 

The thing I love about this location, is the Biker Rally that takes place weekly...you have got to see it to believe it. Truly amazing. 

The staff is always courteous and quick to help you. The menu has just about everything you could want on it, but the wings are a must! From the tame BBQ sauce to the \"Atomic Wings Challenge\" (as seen on Man vs. Food, and you must sign a waiver before even tasting one wing) the sauces are top-notch. My personal favorite is the Arizona Ranch.

If you ever come across one of these restaurants, you need to stop in...I look forward to any business trip I make where there is a QS&L...especially to Middleton, Wisconsin where I had my first taste of the best wings on earth."}
{"text":"I come here often because every week there an event i come on bike nights and ride up with a some friends i ride with so i bring my 2015 gsxr 750 up for part of the event for people to check it out its also nice to be able to get some food and beers while these events are happening fyi i do not drink and ride i tend to love my life."}
{"text":"Ok, this place sucked. Order a long island ice tea and she sends it out with lemonade mix instead of sweet and sour. And wanted to charge 11 bucks for it. The manager didn t come over when told DID nothing. We left without eating. Then down the street at Hooters find out there closing down. I understand why. I wouldn't hire the manager or the bartender, they'll put you out of bussiness."}
{"text":"Um, No. We've tried on two separate occasions to eat at this spot. The first attempt was on a Saturday evening. They told us the wait was 45 minutes and the restaurant was not full! The second attempt was two weeks later we called early in the day and made dinner reservations. We arrived on time only to be told the wait was 30 minutes. I went to the bathroom and saw many empty tables and asked \"what gives?\" The hostess said the kitchen was backed up and he didn't wa t to seat us knowing the wait time at the table would be long. I cannot recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Thunderbird steak ok, not very charcoal flavored or really juicy like Outback Steakhouse. Service was excellent. The burgers are better than steak we think. Wings are usually good here too. Hot wings yay"}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Was sitting at the bar for 10 minutes, with no attention, while two wait staff were yapping away.  I finally got their attention by calling the telephone.   She asks \"are you in a hurry?\".  I thought to myself \"no, I'm in a fucking airport, and I always come here to kill time\".  But I remained polite."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh - You must go to a Quaker Steak and Lube.    The waitress was really good and we had a large party.

Good Food
Good Beer
Good Price

I give it a thumbs up :-)"}
{"text":"I use to love All You Can Eat Wings Tuesdays in State College, Pa until they closed the location. The wings could be made to order, fresh with plenty of sauce or dry rub. Also, they had a salad/nacho/fry/wing buffet to go with the special. After trying this location a few times I can surely say that AYCE Wings Tuesday is no longer an enjoyable occasion even though the wings are made to order and that there is now, as of yesterday, a taco/salad bar. The wings come with little sauce, which doesn't taste as good as they use to, and the dry rubs are barely present. This is a shame because most of their other food isn't that good either, so now there is about no reason to go here anymore."}
{"text":"We came here after a disappointing wait at Johnny's Italian Steakhouse (reviewed it too!) and we're glad we did because spending $30 made us feel better than potentially spending over $100 for crap service at Johnny's. 

Anyway! Moving on. The man had the Arizona El Camino burger, which he loved and claims to be his favorite burger now. I had the BBQ O-ring Cheesesteak, which was good but I think I would've loved more cheese. We also ordered the Magna Fries which the man inhaled in less than 2 minutes.

Overall great experience. I wish I could remember the name of our server. She was nice enough to wipe down the booth we sat in because it was a little sticky. And she was attentive but not annoying. Whoever you are, thanks!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time.  We both had a burger and fries.  Burger was good,  fries were excellent.  While the service was fine, I couldn't help but notice how unhappy all the staff seemed.  I don't usually notice that stuff,  but once I did, I watched.  Very unhappy staff.  Makes you wonder why."}
{"text":"Small cramped area, few televisions. Not anything special on the menu. My wings still had feathers on them. In the summer they have bike night which brings in riff raff. I will not be returning. There are better wings at Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I was born & raised in the area and I always hear so much about this place. I've been here at least a half dozen times and every time I walk out thinking \"Meh\". I've never understood why the draw to this place is the wings. If you want great wings you're only 5 minutes from Wings, Suds & Spuds. They're wings put Quaker Steak's to shame. This place has a great atmosphere and is a cool place to grab a drink and a bite to eat, but IMO it's drastically overrated. Especially when there are so many other places to spend your hard earned $$$ so close by."}
{"text":"Seven of us went for a late lunch on June 7, 2014.  Hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait and that's exactly how long it was.

Our server was excellent.  Kitchen took forever to get our orders out.

Pros: Service, Onion Rings, Wings
Cons: Potato soup was awful and removed from bill; Burger ad fries came out so late just sent the thing back & it was removed from bill; A salad was ordered without onions and it came with onions;

Additional 20% reduction on bill by manager as apology.  I have no reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"It is a fun place with a lot of auto and motorcycle memorabilia. The menu is very taste and the food is fun! The service is fantastic!!! You can go and see sports in the bar or bring your family in as well!!"}
{"text":"Fully staffed with plenty of space! Indoor area has separate sections with a bar area, an additional indoor area that openes into a well covered patio and a separate building that offers an open patio with a full menu bar.   Well known for  bike nights that offer live entertainment, contests, vendors, giveaways and specials."}
{"text":"Really good wings with a variety of flavors and heat levels."}
{"text":"While I would love to take about the place it's just as good as it is and not as good as it should be. The atmosphere which is very garage like and honestly pretty fun, IF you are at all into cars, bikes, or Motorsports the food is just \"very typical\".
I'm not trying to be a complete ass about this but the food was just very typical bar food and not at all memorable as the decor clearly is. 
The incongruity only draws, in my opinion, attention to the disparaging differences between the two. 
Oh yes, being once again the potentially grumpy reviewer: it always bothers me when staff is taking a break and eating, in \"uniform\" just a table away. 
Have them in the back of house or in a closed section which there clear was while I was there. On a pretty empty Saturday night...which should also be a concern.. Empty Saturday night. But then again it's not football season."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but stopped in after a movie. The service was outstanding from the moment we walked in the door until the moment we walked out the door. I was impressed with everything and the food was good. The manager stopped by our table to check on us and all of the employees seemed genuinely happy to be working there. Great mojo!"}
{"text":"This place seams, well I don't know strange. The decor screams at you and there are very large objects hanging from the ceiling which can be very scary.

I tried the wings since they were voted best wings in Pittsburgh. Well lets just say they were good but not the best I have every had. Now maybe for Pittsburgh they are but I wasn't there long enough to test.

It's fairly cheap here too and a nice size bar area as well. I saw a sign that said they had a free buffet or maybe it wasn't free for halftime of all Steelers games. That's pretty dang cool. 

This is a great place for manly men."}
{"text":"Want a loud, obnoxious chain restaurant with over seasoned, over cooked, over priced food?  Boom!    You found it!"}
{"text":"Ugh, where to start? Arrived and was told the wait would be about 45 minutes - cool expected to have a wait time. Except didn't expect to count at least 10 tables empty. The hostess tried to pass the buck that the kitchen staff was in the weeds. Having quite a bit of restaurant experience  under my belt I recognized it for what it was - front of house was trying to pre-close. Wait time was meant to turn people away. Got seated when the hostess realized that none of the groups waiting were going to leave.

Waitperson was ummm efficient. Yeah I'll go with that. Drinks were good, food too.  Food came out all at once after a long wait, no apps first, then food. Bavarian pretzel sticks were overpriced but good. C'mon almost $9 for 4 of them? Wings, as always, were the high point. But, in what world do 6 wings weigh a pound? Whole wings maybe, but not disjointed ones. Should have been 10-12 to a pound. Heck I'd even accept 8. But 6? No way."}
{"text":"this place is full of dumb colleges students. just watched this girl make now three laps around the place with my food. she brought my food, my steak reminds me of a piece of charcoal. anyways sometimes it's good, that's why i put a 3. one time my friend got a bug in her drink and cried like maybe that was too much but still. anyways i come here 2 times a week maybe 3 if i'm wild. it's alright."}
{"text":"Horrible experience entire order was wrong.  Seriously disgusting fatty wings.  I ordered a salad it was complete opposite of what I ordered. She said she credited the bill I was still billed full amount.  \"Mike the supposed owner\". Drama queen refused to rectify issue.  Was trying to resolve and went off on a tangent.  It's gross food. They are rude.  Buffalo Wild Wings way better and you get what you order."}

And they're a good size, too! The service is always good. Their drinks are a bit too weak for my taste (lol) but other than that, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Currently here waiting.  Walked in and the place is almost empty and its a 15-20 minute wait to be seated.  We decided to order our food to go.  The hostess sent us to the bar to place an order which seemed to cause confusion but anyways we placed our order and waited.  They could have swept the floor since the place is mostly empty.  I would hate to see it on a busy night if they are this slow with numerous empty tables.  It's hard for me to believe that six small wing dings weigh an entire pound.  I don't know what scale they used.  They should just offer wings in quantities instead of pounds because it is very misleading. We got our to go order 45 minuets later.  Super slow for an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent visitor of this place however I have been there a handful of times since they have released a new menu and I have to say I have been very disappointed, it no longer has the same Quaker steak feel to it and every time I visit it seems as if the wings just keep getting smaller and smaller. After my last visit when it took over 55 minutes to get an order of boneless wings and fries on a slow Tuesday, I will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I found Quaker Steak & Lube as a nice place to sit down and relax while waiting for my flight home.  The restaurant's name is a play off of the Commonwealth's motor oil company, Quaker State.  This explains the restaurant design having an auto theme, filled with street style signage, license plates, auto parts, gas stations, etc...  Don't let the \"Steak\" in their name fool you, wings are the feature item here.  QS&L is a franchise and currently has over 65 locations spreading throughout 18 states.

I would be lying if I said the wings were the best I ever had, heck not even in my Top 10.  But as a wing aficionado, that is a very hard list to crack.  The wings were fair and the sauce (went w \"hot\") was tasty.  I found the wings very similar to competitor Buffalo Wild Wings.  Also similar, QS&L has over 20 sauce options, from standard offerings such as medium and hot to more unique such as siracha and haute parm.  Many of the sauces are available for purchase by the bottle.

Pros:

Service - I found the service to be very good here.  There were two staffers tag teaming the restaurant (including the bar) and they did a solid job with refills and making sure that I had everything I needed.

Atmosphere - You get to take advantage of PGH International Airport free wifi while being able to take your pick between four nice sized HD televisions.  

Post Meal - I was presented with a Twizzler and a nice sized wet wipe in QS&L branded packaging.

Cons:

Blue Cheese - they tried to get away with providing one teeny-tiny pre-packaged container.  Fortunately the staff was very accommodating and delivered on providing an additional.  

Outlets - Airport restaurants need to get on the ball and provide more power outlets for their customers.  Who doesn't want to power up before catching a plane?  

Beer glass sizes - Only one size option 16 oz (nothing smaller or bigger) available.  

All things said, a fine place to spend your time pre-flight.  I Can certainly see myself returning to QS&L in the future."}
{"text":"Went there for the wings. Sauce was worth it but the wings them self were not. They were over cooked. Prices were higher then the overall quality. The restaurant was not very clean which was also concerning."}
{"text":"service was good, but the food kinda sucked...

I can see going for the gimmick and drinking with group, but not for a meal"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. Went in expecting a grease-loaded nitemare, came away with functional pub-grub.

Was kinda a pinch search in the corridor, but wanted something sit down and not too horrible. Had never tried one of these so the flyer, excitement element was in play. Turned out pretty well.

The race car vibe totally fit the Lowe's Motor Speedway environs -- plus a car dealership is next door. Kinda cheesy, but good sight lines to the screens in the main dining area.

Like a hundred other places, they hype their wings. An app sampler (medium) justified it. Nice, dry, firm wings with a little spice (hot would be my choice next time) were very good. Could see making a nice entree of an order.

But instead we rolled a bbq steak sammich (\"Thinly shaved sirloin sautéed with our BBQ sauce, crispy breaded thick-cut O-Rings, chunky bacon and Cheddar-Jack cheese\"), a chicken wrap, and a turkey melt.

Not fancy, not high-end, but very well turned out. Nothing goopy, runny, or salty -- just well done, watch the TV, and get full fare. No complaints. But a bonus were the freshly finished, meaty, and not greasy french fries that appealed to even non-fry fans. Cannot honestly say if we just got lucky, but you can tell when a fry has been fired to order or not. Good luck.

Service was OK, a bit of the fire-and-forget mode in these types of joints, but nothing below par. Did wish that the draft selection was a little more evolved -- no local crafts - or crafts of any kind - were an option, so Yuengling it was. Real bummer."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple weeks ago for lunch.  Tried the lunch buffet - for $8.99 you get salad, make-your-own meatball subs, pasta, fries, boneless wings and chicken wings.  Also had a soup, IIRC.  The food was pretty good, and I heard you can request wings in your choice of sauce if it is not available, although I did not ask."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet...not too crowded.  We had the buffet and all-you-can-eat wings.  The buffet food is mediocre, so you're doing the buffet for the wings, which make it worth the 8.99 price tag.  Once I live closer, have a feeling I will be here more often."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because the food was good. However. The service was absolutely terrible. We were a party of 4 adults arrived about 5:15. There was very few people in the place, many open tables and we were told it would be 15 minutes. This should have been our first hint they were understaffed. After about 5 minutes and they seated 2 parties of 2 who arrived after us, we spoke to the manager. He did seat us but acted like he was doing us a great favor. The waitress came about 5 minutes later got our drinks and we were all prepared to order. She took our orders and a lot more people started to arrive. After about 10 minutes the waitress returned and told us several large parties had come in and  there would be a little delay in getting our food. When I questioned why, if we had been there first and our order placed immediately, would we have to wait? I was met with a blank stare. We were just ready to walk out when our food arrived after over an hour after order was placed. The food arrived hot and was good, however one of our party did not get her dressing and we asked twice before it came. She then refilled our drinks but gave the wrong ones to us. The final straw was when she brought us our wet wipes and all 4 were bone dry! I generally leave a tip of minimum 20% but this night was 5% just to make sure she knew I had not forgot. Will never return here. No wonder Quaker State is closing multiple locations with service like this."}
{"text":"Went there 2 years ago when I was last in PA. Returned this year I wasn't disappointed. The wings were great. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the sauces. I pick them up and take them home.  Is smuggle the wrong word?  Interstate commerce as I fly them back in my suitcase to California. :-)

The lunch buffet has most of their main dishes for 8.99 all you can eat AYCE, but the food sits too long and is not as good as ordering individual items.  Stick to the day/night specials and the prices are good and the food comes out hot.  Beer was also cheap, but only for bud/coors.  Don't try to find a real beer here."}
{"text":"I'd been to the QSL in Valley View a few times, so I knew what to expect. Bar food in a sports bar atmosphere, a pretty average kind of deal. 

This was sadly below that average. 

Though it's been here a while now, I'd just not made it to the Lakewood location yet (there are just so many other great choices here...) but my friend was looking for comfort food - nothing fancy, a burger, fries, onion rings, etc. and it was Valentine's Day, and my friend is actually my ex (yes, we're weird), but I still wanted to go to a sit down and relax a minute place, so a very non-romantic venue like QSL seemed like the best bet. 

I'm not good at gambling. 

Blah and ick sum it up the best I think. 

They were very clearly short staffed (maybe they didn't expect anyone on VDay?) - as there were a lot of empty tables but a 20 minute wait for seating and all the servers were running as fast as they could for everything. I'm not sure who to blame for that, but it was chaotic and rushed and just a little off putting to have to wait for a table when we were looking at 6 or so empty tables right next to the waiting area. 

I'm guessing it was the short staffed situation that got her to that place, but our server was barely even friendly. I am a total sucker for overworked servers and I gave her a lot of benefit of the doubt (even tipped her well despite the lack of a smile, because I really did feel for her) -- but management needs to take notice of this -- your servers are going to be terrible if they're way overworked. And that reflects poorly on you more than it does on them to some of us. 

As for the food... just don't bother. Look, I'm not expecting haute cuisine from the QSL - but the Magna fries were barely even warm and the cheese might have been melted at one point, my friend's burger was eh, at best, and I made the insanely bad decision of ordering a steak with broccoli and green beans. The rib eye was oddly rubbery, and delivered rare despite my medium rare request (well done would have served this cut better) - with little piles of completely unseasoned and barely steamed broccoli and green beans. I took those home and cooked them a little more with some butter and salt, and still they tasted... off. Or it could have just been my mindset. 

The only thing that was passable in the meal was the onion rings that came with his burger. Those were actually decent. Not great, but decent. 

I didn't expect great things from QSL, but I was still surprised at just how bad they could make it."}
{"text":"Best wings,,, bartender Nancy is awesome"}
{"text":"So downhill from where used to be! I still get suckered in from time to time by the arizona ranch. Im quickly reminded why this was awesome in my college days and where this place is headed. Flavor is awful. Quality is way down and service is subpar to anything close by. Go elsewhere this is a name game so you think they are really good at it. they are not. Should have seen kittchen :("}
{"text":"Enjoyed the buffalo chicken wings (hot)... while waiting for my airplane to come in.  Very good."}
{"text":"I dig Quaker steak. Growing up in a super small town.. Coming to Quaker steak as a kid for all you can eat wings are legit memories of my childhood. 

The decor is cute with the cars and motorcycles everywhere. My go to sauce is Lousiana Lickers. My boyfriend ordered their steak hoagie which had a fried pickle on it and Arizona ranch. 

This location is 10 million times better than Oakland one omg!

As much as I want to be basic and give it 3 stars I love their wings and sauce."}
{"text":"When I arrived it had just finished raining and the patio bar tender was just starting to put the tables and chairs back put on the patio. There did not seem to be a large amount of people here. The bar tender quickly saw me standing near the bar and came and apologized (yet had done nothing, but i understand that some people would complain for no reason) and cleaned off a chair for me to sit in. 

When I was ready to order he helped me save a few bucks by informing me of their specials on both beer and food.

He was extremely attentive and constantly busy; a great employee. However, not checking in so often that it could annoy you. When my beer was empty, he got me another one. When my food came he checked in a bit later ot make sure it was as expected. When I was done with my food he asked how it was.

This is basically a prime example of what I call ideal service. Pretty sure the guys name was Kyle b. hard to read a quick moving name tag.

Food was prepared as expected. It was all fresh, hot, and delicious."}
{"text":"This place quickly became a favorite. The beverages on tap were local and tasty, and the staff friendly.

Based on the experience the other \"consumers\" were enjoying with me, I would venture to say we all had a superb time.

The wings were very good for airport food and the atomic sauce was... uh, yeah, you guessed it... HOT. While tears did not stream down my face, I did dip my fry in the sauce and called it a day.

Cheers, 

O"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner with my fam I had the taco salad I enjoyed it. Wife had the ribs tender ribs sauce sweet was pretty good she says. Kids had the chicken tenders no complaints from them lol. Server was nice Katie thanks I know it was busy ya did well and deserved a pat on the back. 

Tried the onion rings the sauce is spicy I think personally it might go better with wings just saying maybe try honey mustard or regular mustard or some type of sour cream i don't know just making suggestions perhaps a nacho cheese or run down a list? 

Still I had enjoyable time fair food nice. .
99 meal deal for the kids today very cool all In all if I'm back in the Cleveland area I think I'm likely to stop by with the fam again thanks for the timely service they said 10 mins for a table I got it in 3 I think something fast anyway cheers to a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"So this is my very first time here. And I went back and forth between being happy and wanting to walk out. 

So the service was awful. We made sure to order refills or fresh drinks all at once. Our server always forgot at least 1 drink. They are busy, I get it, but she never really checked back with us. It was like we were on a conveyor belt where she just took our order and left. Then someone else delivered our food and that was it.

So the food. The wings were great! Wow. I am not a wings person and their sauce just won me over!  I was really impressed with the price and quality. I also had the chicken quesadilla. I am never expected to be wowed but it was a little underwhelming. It was not hot. I had the cheese sticks. Very generous portion and pretty darn tasty.  I will be back, but I hope the service improves."}
{"text":"Great wings, expensive but delicious. Arizona ranch, hot, and Louisiana Lickers are my fav. They are pretty meaty as well. The other food is alright, nothing too special. If you are a wing fanatic like me, then this is a must try. They do have a day where is is all you can eat for a price, might be a nice way to try all the flavors and see what your fav will be."}
{"text":"The Lubeburger here was fantastic....I was visiting family and the Cleveland Clinic for interviews.  

My uncle took me here and it has a great ambience (I loved the 50's style car and bikes that pervaded the place and the gas/jukebox).  The service was friendly and the food came quickly.

The Lubeburger was great and probably one of the best burgers that I had in a long time....it was a large meat patty, bleu cheese and a great collection of spices on it..."}
{"text":"The scrambled breakfast platter is the way to go! For $6.99, you get 3 scrambled eggs, 4 slices of thick cut bacon, 2 pieces of toast, and hash browns! The best part is that the eggs are fresh eggs! Everything on the platter is excellent! Service was great! I would probably share this platter next time! If you have time to stop by before your flight, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great wings. Nice outdoor patio. Good and fast service."}
{"text":"Food is not that good and overpriced. Management seems to be lacking. Would not return to eat or drink here."}
{"text":"The service here is so incredibly slooowwww I don't understand how they stay in business.  I've NEVER not waited what seemed like an eternity to get my order.  Half the tume the order is so messed up someone has to wait even longer and food must be sent back.  We just waited 15 minutes in this mostly empty place for drinks before getting up and leaving for good.  Note that other Quaker Steaks are no where near this bad.  This location needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Tuesday nights all you can eat wings and $3.00 big Yuengling beers! How great is that?!"}
{"text":"Valley View QS&L around 2pm. Wanted to enjoy a cold drink on a hot day. The outside bar/patio was open. Service was pretty slow. No bartender outside so I had to wait for him to \"check up\" on me for a refill or food. I like the place however. They have live music and bike nights which is fun. Just a bad day I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome location located in the southwest terminal @ Pittsburgh international airport (across from gate a7). Food is good as other locations and service is awesome. Indoor and \"outdoor\" seating options available. All day happy hour drink specials!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and are in search of great places to eat.  Unfortunately, Quaker Steak & Lube is not one of them.  The customer service was abysmal.  We walk in and ask to be seated outside, as it was a beautiful day.  We were told its first come/first serve and walk ourselves out there.  We found many empty tables, but had to search for one that didn't have crumbs on it.  They were bussed, but just not very well.  We sat there for about 10 minutes...no one has even acknowledged us.  There was a waitress who has been by the table next to us several time, but never said anything to us.  Then the bartender comes over to us and brings us menus and takes our drink order.  About ten minutes later he asks if we wanted to order food.  There were bugs (fruit fly size) flying around...and after my husband pulled several out of his beer...he looked down and had 4 more in there.  We decide we'd rather sit inside.  My husband walks over to the bar tender and requests a table inside.  The bar tender turns to someone who looks like she may be a manager and she directs us to talk to the hostess to be seated inside.  The person who was bringing our food out hears this and offers to find a table for us.  We are seated and our food is delivered.  They were nice enough to split the burger and onion rings for us, but the burger was just above room temperature.  It was still yummy, just would have liked it to be warm and hot off the grill.   Maybe I expected too much.  The onion rings were very good...the wings were decent.  If it weren't for the terrible service, we would have definitely given it another shot.  Every single employee in that restaurant looked very unhappy.  No smiles at all.  Nobody was friendly.  It was kinda depressing.  There are just too many other choices in the Madison area to treat customers like this."}
{"text":"In town for a few days. Stopped in with our group to get some wings. We were seated fairly quickly but waited for a long time for someone to take our drink order. Finally got up and left. The hostess watched us walk out and never said anything to us. Think this kind of thing happens routinely here. Disappointed as this was not the place I used to frequent. On the other hand went right over to Max and Erma's and had a great meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"Im gone give it 4 because food was fucking bomb! But they kept talking about this damn drive through that they wanted us to pick our food up at. When we finally did that. They not there to give us the food... So I went in lol  but overall good ass food"}
{"text":"My vegetarian status doesn't allow the Arizona Ranch that I once devoured."}
{"text":"Service was fast and polite.  Food came out hot and full of flavor.  Cant ask for more."}
{"text":"Gonna have to knock this place back to Sept 10.   Changed cooks? dishes?  Not sure.   Prices way too much for what we got.   Waiter/waitress was good but the food was meh.  I have had better meals at Culvers.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We came in with a family of 7.  Our excellent waitress noticed our wrist bands from the Great Wolf Lodge and said that we would be getting 15% off.  We really appreciated this and wish it was advertised at the lodge!  

Our waitress Shawna really helped us to find the best combination of wings for our large family and was great about providing plenty of blue cheese and such for everyone.  Drinks refilled promptly.  

We love good wings, and we were not disappointed.  The Haute Parmesan wings are amazing.  

My children enjoyed the trivia and were all able to participate with their ipods.  We wish this chain was in our hometown.  Prices are great and staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"The waitress was very pleasant but didn't do a very good job.  The Mac and cheese was pretty tastey but the noodles were under cooked. Portion was small for the price. Chicken tenders were dry and tasteless. I honestly think they were made earlier in the day and then rewarmed. Absolutely awful. The dressings were from a sealed plastic cup. Gross. French Fry grease must have been ancient; fries were soggy and dark brown. Yuck. Not the Steak and Lube of Sharron PA!  The original store would be SO disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow and wings were not that great-expected waaay better!"}
{"text":"Not Bad , But averaged $1.15 per WING !!! 
 Nice selection of flavors , kinda greasy but good. I ordered the louisiana licker sauce. ( you know , something different ) And i ate too damn many. now my tummie hurts ! LOL"}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had!
Atmosphere was very friendly 
Our waitress was incredibly polite
Could be expensive but recommend going on Thursday for half price wings
So many sauces to choose from!
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.    It's pretty clear the staff is really unhappy and have just given up.   Mistake after mistake followed by mediocre food.    I really love eating at QS&L restaurants, but it probably be a while before I give this one another chance."}
{"text":"We do not have Quaker Steak & Lube in the Detroit area so my trip to your restaurant yesterday was my first experience and i have to say it was incredible. The atmosphere and the food were good but the only reason i wanted to comment was for the service. My waitress Kennedy was absolutely incredible. She Wow'd me from the moment i sat down, she truly deserves kudos and you should be proud to have her as a part of your team!"}
{"text":"Recently returned to this Quaker Steak with my kids and a different, equally large group of high school students, and I'm happy to report that the staff fully redeemed themselves. The food was typical--well executed suburban chain food. You know what you're getting in these places, and they did a serviceable job making the food match the descriptions in the menu. Indeed, no one in our group had anything bad to say about the visit.

More importantly, the staff handled our group of about 40 swiftly and efficiently, plenty of smiles on their faces the entire time, after we'd been seated in a cluster of tables as a group--not spread out around the facility, as often happens.

Good for you, Quaker Steak!"}
{"text":"I just got done eating at Quaker Steak and Lube, and I was very very disappointed. I recently saw this restaurant featured on the show Man vs Food and the food looked delicious mainly the wings. I'm a big fan of wings so I ordered a few wings with some coleslaw. I didn't have time to eat there so I placed an order for pick up. I was told the food should be ready in about 15-20 minutes. I arrived to pick up my food about 15 minutes after ordering and I had to wait another 15 minutes to receive my food. Once I got my food I opened up my bag and observed the carrots and celery in little plastic bags like you would find in a 4th graders lunch. There was no utensils or napkins which I discovered when I was long gone. Once arriving home I then began with the fries. The fries were barely warm and not salted. the coleslaw didn't taste like anything and the tasted old. As for the wings they were okay at best, the wings were cold. With my hopes high for a great lunch I was let down by disappointing food."}
{"text":"I love QSL, the food the atmosphere and the service are always great. Add to that a great kids menu and it's home run for the family."}
{"text":"Good service, ok food, pricey for what it is. $53.00 for 2 sandwiches and 2 beers. Wish there was 1/2 stars would have said 2 1/2."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of QSnL, but as of late 2014 this location has gone down hill.   Portion size and quality has gone down.   I can only assume it has something to do with the local management."}
{"text":"Was a great place to get a lunch buffet with unlimited wings.  Sadly as of today 1/30/17, the lunch buffet is no more.  Spoke with management and I guess this location is the \"test restaurant\".  So they are trying a new salad/soup bar, minus the rest of the buffet.  Then have daily specials.  Wasn't impressed at all.  Ended up getting a basket of boneless wings and the salad bar.  Cost a bit more then the original buffet but had plenty.  Just not the same.  Won't be returning anytime soon.  If you do go, call first to see if they've brought the lunch buffet back.  I wasn't the only one complaining about the missing buffet.  Lots of folks said the same as I did.  Guess we can hope it comes back."}
{"text":"I come here for wings and a drink from time to time.  I always sit at the bar and the service is fine and dandy.  The wings aren't bad, they can tell me if something is going to mess up my insides due to celiac, and they have cider and a full bar of things safe for me to drink.  There's nothing special to a Quaker Steak.  Each one is the same and you know what you're going to get.  But it's a solid three-star wing meal with four-star service and a two star ugly chain restaurant decor.  It's good enough when a few of my buddies want to meet up for wings in that area or if there's a rather large group looking for wings."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group on what happened to be biker night, although we were just going to sit inside. The people outside had everyone in our group who would be drinking get wristbands, although our waitress later told us these were not required. I just came here for the drinks while watching various family members engage in a wing eating contest. First I had a new glarus moon man beer which was tasty, although served in a plastic cup. Then I had a \"cherry pop\", a drink with cherry vodka, margarita mix, and grenadine. It was supposed to come with a. lollipop stirrer but did not, and also came in a plastic cup. Overall, tasty but visually underwhelming. Also I really wanted that lollipop.

UPDATE: apparently, my aunt ordered \"Jack's Honey Lemonade\" which was also served in a plastic cup without a lemon wedge, despite being shown in a mason jar with a lemon wedge on the menu. Also there was a fly in it. 

Also at the beginning of the drinks menu, there is a page describing the restaurant's commitment to \"bringing the best draft beer possible to their beer drinkers\" by taking steps including using \"clean, aroma free glasses\". :("}
{"text":"Ok...I was in Pittsburgh on a business trip.  When it comes to business trips, I ALWAYS ask for local places to eat, and if I can find it in Chicago...no can do.  And as you may know from my previous reviews...this is ESPECIALLY true when it comes to chains.

Having said that...Quaker Steak & Lube is an outstanding chain restaurant that we do not have in Chicago (sadly enough).  When you drive up to the place, it looks like one of those older gas stations from the past.  When you walk in...it feels like a very cozy nicely decorated places where you can get good grub and a decent beer.

What is so cool about this place you ask?  WELL...They serve BUCKETS of wings.  You heard me right.  I am a fan of any places that serve AWESOMELY tasty wings...and in buckets.  I was soooooo thrilled when I heard about the concept, I sat down and polished off 28 of those suckers by myself...and washed it down with my favorite beer.

I can't WAIT til they open one of these suckers in Chicago...Now...when it comes to chains...THIS IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and have had good dinners especially wings.  This is the second time I had ribs the first time they were great.  This time they were reheated over cooked and lacked enough bbq sauce to make them remotely appealing.   Very disappointing!  I didn't even finish a half rack and the coleslaw was warm. Yuck!"}
{"text":"motor oil and lug nut central. i feel like i'd been warped back to a 50's drag race here. this motor vehicle mecca is disguised as a restaurant. 

old, souped up cars filled the parking lot. their owners prowdly displaying them. a hot rocking band was playing that made me wish i was wearing a poodle skirt and tight sweater.

the service was terrible. we waited an hour for a table, where several were clearly available. upon finally getting one, our waitress gave us 10 minutes to order drinks! another 5 to get them to us, and another 5 to correct them! after the screw ups, we were forced to tip in the end, as it was already included in the bill.

the steak was delicious. nothing extrodinary. the wing sauces scared me, as it went all the way up to atomic. have no fear, there are plenty of other greasy choices to decide from. 

i like this place, but the management of service could use some help."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube is a great place to go for wings. I start with the onion rings served on a car antenna. The Thaiasian wings are my favorite. Not too hot, not too mild. Ask for them 'crispy'.

QS&L has outdoor seating, which raises them a notch on my scale. They serve good American fare at a mid-range price."}

{"text":"I had the Philly Cheese Steak Flat bread and it was dah bomb!  The service and the food was great.  The place has a unique look to it, like a 1950s diner on the outside.  On the inside it has race car decorations all over the place.  I went on a Wednesday night and they had a rock band there on the bar side.  The rock band was good, but I was sitting on the restaurant side and just wasn't in the mood to hear all of that noise.  So I am giving it 4.5 stars instead of 5.   I will definitely go back again, I will just make sure it's not concert night."}
{"text":"Chicken was awesome! The Smokey Gold barbecue sauce added to the greatness! My best friend had the Honey Stung chicken, and it was great as well. I highly recommend Quaker Steak & Lube to all chicken lovers."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet used to be pretty good. The last few times I've been here, including today, all the buffet food is barely room temperature and everything appears to be frozen food, nothing fresh. I told the server that nothing was very warm, but I never saw anyone check the buffet. Not worth the $10 any more."}
{"text":"We had the half a rack (of ribs) with a lb. of wings combo. It all comes down to the sauces you chose. The baby back ribs were tender but without the sauce are nothing special. The wings were crunchy and again, it's the sauce. The garlic parm and ranch are like kissing cousins- not much difference in taste. Our sides were better- black beans and rice and the coleslaw.  Don't bother with the mixed berry shortcake with vanilla ice cream. The mixed berries - probably jam straight out of a bottle and the shortcake biscuit was too dry and a little tough. It's close to home and this was a convenient place so I gave it a 4.  Draft beer selection is ok."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the buffet lunch special at Quaker Steak in Sheffield Village. Mon - Fri, 11-2p.m. Check out menu online, everyday the buffet features different varieties of scrumptious foods, including fresh salad bar & hot soups, plus daily desserts! Including, your choice of regular or boneless wings, from a huge menu of different flavors, YES, comes with buffet! We were greeted at the door by a most hospitable hostess, Tracey. She was so delightful & friendly. Our server, Sam, was equally as enthusiastic to make us feel welcomed. Sam was helpful & attentive. As we all know, half of the pleasure of eating out is service! #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"I have given up on this Quaker Steak. I normally do not post negative reviews because we all have bad days. However, after two consecutive bad experiences I will not return. 

A few months ago I ordered a potato soup to go. I love potato soup. About half way through I was chewing on something I had to spit out and investigate- gross! After I unfolded the little ball I discovered it was a circle sticker \"THU.\" Mind you I'm eating this on Sunday. Needless to say I did not finishing eating... 

Today I gave them another try. I knew I shouldn't, but I had to go to drug mart and it's right there. So I ordered the potato soup again and the wedge salad. The soup had two pieces of potato. Disappointing to say the least. I opened my salad and found a chuck of lettuce browning on all sides and throughout. I fresh cut the edges and gave it a try. The bacon was all fat. The red onions were browning also. Straight to the trash, what a waste."}
{"text":"So I've done the whole Quaker Steak thing before. Usually it's ok at best. The other week I stopped into the one in Lakewood for lunch. To my surprise they had a HUGE assortment of craft beer. Most corporate restaurants aren't hip to the whole IPA thing. These guys had 4. On draft. That doesn't count the bottles. So I thought I was going to go for a liquid lunch then I saw one of the fish baskets. Two giant chunks of fish, fries and slaw. It felt like a fish and chips kind of day after I saw that. I was not disappointed. But very very full. Just enough room for one more loose cannon before I headed home. The bartender was cool(friendly & attentive), even though it was a little busy. The manager stopped by when I first got there and helped me pick my beer. Good pick by the way. I bought a six pack of it on the way home. I will definitely be back. They told me they have a steak special on Saturday and show UFC fights. Sound perfect to me."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for wing night but tonight the service and the food was just bad. I had three different types of wings and they all came out cold. The waiter was busy well others were standing around. Took for ever for new drinks to come and about 25 mins or so since I had asked for the check to the time I was able to pay and leave."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak & Lube in Valley View always has some kind of food special, or drink special, or special event going on.  Always.  And for that reason my wife likes to call and see 'what the happs is' before we head into the Valley.  $0.60 wing night...  Let's go!

It was 6pm on a Wednesday when we arrived - there wasn't a wait so we were seated immediately.  My wife looked at the menu calendar and saw that wing night was on Thursdays and not Wednesdays like she was told on the phone earlier.   She was rather disappointed about the misinformation she had received and the fact we unknowingly made the trip for a $7.99 chicken salad special instead.  Salad? Ew.

We both decided to get burgers instead.  They were very good and the sauces (two barbecue and a ranch jalapeno) our server (Kyle) brought out made them even better.  Kyle was very attentive, friendly, and fast.  Mid-meal a manager came over and asked how everything was.  Even if her food was awful my wife doesn't normally say anything but tonight she did.  She told the manager of the call she made earlier that day and the bad information she received.  I was pretty impressed.  I provide feedback to business managers all the time - solicited or not.  Positive or negative.  Like the honey badger I just don't care.  My wife isn't like me at all and I was quite surprised when she responded to Quakers manager the way she did.  Anyways...
The manager apologized in a manner and tone as though she was calming a crying baby.  It was over-the-top and a bit funny.  As a result it felt very insincere.  She offered to give us a coupon we could use on our next visit - but she never brought it to us.  She walked by our table a few times after the conversation but never gave us this alleged coupon.  We left couponless and I knew then that her apology was likely insincere.

Because of all the unique events Quaker Steak in Valley View has (frozen turkey bowling, bike night, breakfast with Santa, Yappy hour, live music, the End-of-the-world party, and many more i can't think of) we will definitely be back.  It's a fun time with great food overall."}
{"text":"What happened to this place, I am sticking with my local bar for wings. The sauce tastes horrible, no flavor, thought the wings were dipped in crisco, no flavor and no heat. Just hot slimy grease. Would give this a negative star if I could."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm a big chicken wing fan and was in the Cleveland Airport on business.  Had some time and I have heard good things about this place so I thought I would give it a try.

No one greeted me, I had to wander in and find a server to be seated.  Then I ordered a dozen boneless wings (I was in a suit and didn't want to sauce on it) half original buffalo flavor and half BBQ.  It took quite a while to get the order and when it came out, I was disappointed to say the least.  The chicken pieces looked like slightly large chicken McNuggets.  The Buffalo wings had hardly any sauce on them were in the bottom of the basket covered up by the BBQ wings which had a ton of sauce on them.  I pointed this out to the waitress and just got a shrug in return.  When the check came there was a $.99 charge because I had ordered two different sauces.  I asked the manager to remove the charge and she said she couldn't.  I am in the Cleveland Airport a lot, but I will never get dinner here again."}
{"text":"Not too terrible a place, though I think that maybe Adam Richman might have overreacted just a bit when he gushed about its merits on television.  It's good... but not \"zomg I have to stop here\" good.

Decor was the best thing about the place - lots of old classic cycles and cars.  It's obvious they put a lot of work into it.  

Quiet the night we went (Friday night at 9pm), which we thought a bit unusual.

I had grilled boneless wings with a side of broccoli.  I know, weird combination, but I was trying to stick to my menu plans and I think I did an okay job with that.  I'm admittedly a wimp, so I didn't get the \"atomic flame\" stuff - seriously, eating shouldn't be painful - but I did choose a semi-spicy sauce, Arizona Ranch, which I thought would be okay enough for me to handle, and it was.  I think I could have actually went up a bit on the spice level, for all that. Magna fries were... fries, not much you can really do to mess up fries, you know?  Good but unremarkable.

The wings were good, for sure, and the broccoli was nice and crispy, didn't disappoint there.  I just don't think that it's as great as it's been claimed to be.  Portion sizes were definitely a disappointment - I was seeing people twirl huge amounts of wings in buckets and that's what I'd expected to get, not a small plate with maybe six or seven wings, tops.  Still, it was worth the money we'd paid (maybe 30 bucks in all) and the service was decent, so we'd definitely come back.  

Our expectations will be a lot lower, however.

3.5, rounded up because service was good."}
{"text":"I'm a girl who likes her options, so Tuesday nights when they do the All You Can Eat wing special is perfect for me. Not because I plan on eating a bathtub of chicken parts, but because I have a tendency to regret what I order as soon as I see someone else's food. Maybe it's a quest for entree greatness, who knows. I just enjoy getting a little of this, and a little of that. 

It is quite loud and busy(plan to wait if you're going on a Tues!), and obviously not what I'd call \"high(or even middle) end\". If THAT'S what you're looking for, what are you going to a wing joint for, anyway?"}
{"text":"I got to sample a couple of chicken wings as part of a Yelp tasting event.

I sampled the spicy garlic wings & my boyfriend tried the Louisiana Lickers.  The wing was nice and crunchy, with a nice coating of sauce on it. 

The restaurant was located very out of the way and I could see how it could go unnoticed.  Also, the gentleman who served us our wings was very friendly and explained the sauces on the wings to us.

My review is for the brief but great experience I had at Quaker Steak & Lube. I did not get to go inside the restaurant or test out their whole menu. Therefore, I didn't let those or past experiences/past reviewers affect my review.  I sampled their chicken wings and observed their customer service, and I was happy with both. 


*Time to vent*  I remember these exact wing sauces, from when I was a kid and I had to get my dad a birthday gift so I'd buy him a bottle of Louisiana Lickers from Giant Eagle. I mean it's a good sauce, but can't they come up with something else?  Something new and exciting? They really need to revamp their menu and redecorate - there's so many other places, in this airport alone, passing them up because they're exciting diners in new ways, something Quaker Steak hasn't figured out yet."}
{"text":"First off, the name kind of creeps me out.  I just don't think the word \"lube\" belongs in a restaurant name, yaknow?  Still, I knew the hubby would enjoy some hot wings, and I had heard theirs were good.

I have never intentionally ordered wings ( I have always looked at them like, \"What's the point?\") until I visited this restaurant recently.  I really liked the fact that dh and I could split a larger order of wings, and each get different flavors.  DH got his in a much spicier sauce.  I got mine with a rub.  We each liked them, but since they were served in the same basket, I ended up losing a bunch of my wings due to the spicy sauce being all over them.  That kind of bugged me.  I hadn't thought to specify that the 2 flavors be separated, particularly since I had told the waitress that I couldn't do spicy.

My husband and I shared the wings, and a bbq ranch salad.  The salad was good, but at my limit of spicyness, which really surprised me.  If spice is an issue for you (I wish it weren't for me) then you need to ask lots of questions at this restaurant, I guess.

Be prepared to be completely engulfed in NASCAR paraphernalia.  I'm not talking about a TGIF's level of wall-flair.  This is a LOT of stuff.  We were seated at a table right next to a full-sized racecar on a lift.  There was a table underneath it, although I'm not sure if I would have been comfortable eating there.  I'm from earthquake country, after all, and it was looming above.

DH enjoyed his beer and wings, and I'm quite sure that they do a ridiculous amount of business during the races."}
{"text":"Omg please! First fire the bartender that worked in the garage on Friday!!!!!! He has the personality of an angry hippo... ooooh unless your his buddy that just showed up then you get treated with a smile and courtesy!!! Won't be back just on the treatment I received from Niko"}
{"text":"Tiny chicken wrap, lousy. Watery coleslaw. Won't be back! Just glad I wasn't paying. I could've gotten better food off Wendy's dollar menu Lol"}
{"text":"I do like the food here. Some servers are very nice, some are clueless. The lunch buffet is strange. You have to order your wings anyhow they aren't on the buffet. Kinda makes that pointless.  
Strange procedure for gift cards at Christmas time. If you are seating and eating, they won't just put the cards on your bill. They make you get in line like the people who walk in just to buy cards that are not even dining in. That is kinda rude. I am your dining guest, I should be getting service .
Aside from oddities like that the food is good. I do like the warm wet wipes!!"}
{"text":"Have to say meh.  Margarita was all mix - no substance. Had reservations for new years Eve and service was meh even though it wasn't crowded.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of this place. If you go in a big group, it can be pretty fun, but for just two people it kinda blows. The food is pretty much as average as it can get. The only real appeal to coming here is the super hot wings. After you've had them all once or twice, there's just no real point in coming. If you insist on coming, come during some special. Expect it to be very loud and busy. The wait staff is a hit or miss.

The mixed drinks are pretty good, so I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Wish I didn't have to even leave 1 star. First off they gave me a burnt steak than as im rooting for my baseball team watching on the main screen they change it with no consideration than the manager uses slander words telling me that my team sucka. I have been in town for work for almost a year now and stop by at least 3 times a week guess I'll just to one of the other 100 places in the area instead."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times and I will say the staff are very friendly.  Bar staff were very good, attentive but not pushy.  The wings are not that great.  It's funny how places which specialize in wings really often fall short when it comes to consistently cooking good wings.  The other food items I have had here were all very good.  Much better than expected.  They have descent specials different days of the week.  Unless you get one of about, 8-10 seats at the bar don't plan on watching the T.V.'s unless you want to strain your neck 90 degrees.  

I was thinking about giving this place 4 stars but their claw machine really let me down.  Absolutely no tension strength when grabbing stuffed animals.  Plain and simple, just taking advantage of people.  Nobody should go there expecting to win any type of stuffed animal out of that thing.  It just ain't happening.  Matter of fact, changing my rating to two stars because of this.  Bush League..."}
{"text":"We went here just before are vacation... so this was a pre-vacation. I've been wanted Quaker steak and lube for so long now, but there is none nearby me unfortunately. On our way to the airport we had time to eat before our flight and started craving food... then we saw the sign and followed it like the norther star.

I haven't been in here in about 10 years. We were overjoyed when were seated, and since it's been so long we ordered a little bit of everything. Some wings, chicken, and some more wings. All were to die for. I also forgot how cool the interior of the store was with the various race cars and sports memorabilia hanging up around the store.

The staff was friendly, the food was great, and the price was perfect for the portion sizes. I will definitely be making my towards the airport in the next month or two for this treasure."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to stop. We vacation at a cabin west of Madison, so we always drive by Quaker Steak as we hop off 14 to 12-18.

The chicken wings were good. My partner's burger was delicious. The range of hot sauces for the chicken wings was admirable.

The automobile kitsch is fun. I am just so jaded about restaurants that I think this is actually a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this three stars in the sense of it is solid--it's not phenomenal, but it's a traditional wings place: you aren't going there for a five star menu, you're going there for comfort food and clogging your arteries.

When you walk in, it's like you've stepped into a NASCAR fan's dream. There's car stuff plastered all over the place, including a working stop and go light. Though, when the place is called \"Quaker Steak & Lube,\" is that really all that surprising? No. Although NASCAR isn't typically associated with class--this join was very clean and the staff members were extremely willing to help out.

I had a grilled boneless chicken in Chipotle BBQ sauce with bleu cheese. My roommate had honey mustard wings with a Green Light Rita (margarita).

My grilled boneless chicken was interesting: I prefer boneless because you get to eat the entire thing as opposed to picking it off a bone and potentially wasting meat. It wasn't really what you typically expect of boneless wings: it was more like a boneless breast with the sauce on it. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure it was worth the ~$8 I paid for it when I could've made it at home. It tasted good, though there's only four boneless wings in that set if you get the regular size. The Chipotle BBQ sauce has a really nice little kick on your tastebuds, but not overwhelming. It's great if you prefer more milder tastes but with only a little bit of spice.

My roommate allowed me to try her honey mustard wings: they're sweet with a very nice glaze. As opposed to Buffalo Wild Wings (which isn't bad)--they cover the entire wing in the sauce as opposed to a dallop here and there in the center of the wing. The meat was succulent and juicy which pleasantly surprises me for a large-scale chain restaurant--but that explains why it got as big as it did!

Her Green Light Rita was very good too; it was very sweet, though I suspect that was because of the melon liqueur within it. I would recommend getting it frozen, however.

Overall, I'll most definitely be back--the service was great! They even give you a warm wipe and a Twizzlers when you leave. I much prefer this place to Buffalo Wild Wings as the sauces are heavier and the meat is more juicy. Next time I'll probably get the wings or the breaded boneless instead, though."}
{"text":"I love football...but since I try to keep it healthy, it's not usually a good idea to go out to a sports bar to enjoy the game with friends. Just not usually much on the menu other than a straight salad to eat. Definitely nothing healthy and fun. Until I stopped by Quaker Steak & Lube that is! They actually have grilled boneless chicken wings! Basically, they are grilled chicken tenders (you can get them crispy too) dipped in your choice of wing sauce. They are served on toasted pita wedges, which make perfect little sandwiches if you cut a chicken tender in half. And it's served with steamed broccoli! I can't tell you how I appreciate having a healthy option to go out and enjoy with friends. Now don't worry....they have plenty of cheese fries, burgers, steak and wings too! And from what my friends have said, those are yummy options as well. I'm just really happy to have some options! 

Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff...man vs food atomic wing challenge!"}
{"text":"Great place for wings and beer, outdoor stage/bar during the summer, bike night every Thursday, and always a great place to see some great cars roll through."}
{"text":"Simple grill and pub chow. Great automotive decor. Service sizes were nice. Food was fresh. Our waitress Sam was very helpful and patient with us making our first visit. Pleasant crowd on a Friday evening about an hour before the rush really started.  Might have been a couple of buck cheaper than Applebee's. We ate under the Lotus. It was a little out of place among the American iron, but cool enough.

Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food is very good! The service however is poor. We waited 15 minutes to get a waiter for drinks, and the wait time for our food was 45 min+. Our waiter only checked on us once after the food arrived, then offered the bill."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill. I used to love to eat the breaded boneless wings here. They were different than every other place I had tried them. The breading used to stay crisp even when covered with sauce. Not anymore. The breading just got soggy and fell off the chicken.

My husband ordered his steak rare, but it came out raw. You could still see pink on the \"cooked\" portion. His shrimp did not have any sauce on it, despite the fact that sauce was mentioned in the menu. His baked potato looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours.

We brought all of this to the manager's attention, and the only thing he did was bring out another steak. He did not rectify the issue with the shrimp or the baked potato. We hoped that maybe we would be comped a portion of the meal since so much was wrong, but no. We paid full price.

We used to drive down to Concord especially to eat here, but we have both decided that we will never eat here again."}
{"text":"If you're going to serve wings and offer blue cheese.  Offer blue cheese not blue cheese dressing... really dressing?  Wtf.  If I wanted to eat healthy I'd find a vegan/vegetarian place to go to.  Get some blue cheese with visible chunks in it.  Not watered down dressing.  If you're going to have a menu with beer on it.  Actually have it on tap or be out of it but we'll have it back on tap on x date. Don't have Yuengling on the menu but not even have it ever."}
{"text":"This place is the most unsanitary, unprofessional establishment in Concord. Most of the food is prepacked. The wings ARE frozen and NOT fresh like they advertise. The carrots and celery are cut and handled by the employees who NEVER wash their hands. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SICK WHILE SPENDING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO PAY FOR IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretzels are good, food is ok service is slow. They don't carry all the wines on the menu because they can't find them in the state of NC"}
{"text":"If you want good wings near Pittsburgh there is at least one obvious choice --Quaker Steak & Lube. Now I won't say these are the best wings in the USA, but the variety of wing sauces & accompaniments is great. And they do know how to cook those suckers.

 They have a solid & varied gluten-free menu, and the servers & bartenders are very friendly. So an out-of-towner like myself can instantly feel welcome. I chose the boneless \"wings\" with Louisiana Lickin' Sauce. Not very spicy but the sauce wasn't overpowering either. The chicken was perfectly cooked, as were the fries.

 Although QS&L doesn't have any gluten-free beers (boo-hiss) they do have at least three hard ciders to satisfy the thirsty patron with a gluten intolerance. I chose the Woodchuck Amber, and it was icy cold -- just as it should be. If you crave wings as your guilty pleasure and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a great place to perch. It's about as casual as you can get and still keep your shoes on, so don't worry about puttin' on the Ritz.
Food is probably 3.5 stars but service is 5, especially for a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"You know, as much as I want to hate this place...  as a liberal...  a former hippie...  as a person who was at one point a vegetarian for more than a year...  a practitioner of yoga for 7 years and counting....  I still just can't resist this place.   They're just a 1970 Dodge Challenger 440 at wide open throttle.  

That spicy burger of theirs is my fave. So freaking good.  So ridiculous, unnecessary, extravagantly unhealthy I'm sure, but so good.  God bless Amurrrricaahh!!!"}
{"text":"It's an ok place, the food is ok, the service I got was personable and good.

I can't get over the gaudy chain storefront that got stuck smack dab in the middle of Lakewood. When I first drove by it I thought it was an eyesore, and when I brought myself to go in, still agreed. It sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb as you drive though the main drag of Lakewood.

I don't find myself motivated to return, but I wouldn't turn down going if someone invited me either."}
{"text":"Me and the husband and my son stop in for lunch we ordered the loaded Mac and cheese w/ chicken and chicken tenders and fries for my son and the hubby had the BQ pulled pork sandwich and we order 2lbs of wings the lemonade drink was delicious and the raspberry tea as well. I had the the Mac it was of the chain and the wings were done to perfection my fries were crispy and my husband sandwich was fantastic I sample everyone meal service was good and it was affordable I enjoyed everything if your in the Robinson area stop in the food is great"}
{"text":"Basically a 2.5 star.  Wings good but $8 for a lb.  Ok, the issue is that they consider 6 wings a lb!!!!  Parents got 2 lbs and it was 10 wings! 

Service slow and just ok.  Tastes good, but better choices if you look."}
{"text":"We dined here last night - 5 of us.  Our server was great so I feel badly giving the low rating but our wings were terrible!!

We ordered the second largest bucket with 2 sauces. The medium were decent.  The Parmesan garlic (their equivalent) was terrible.  I mean terrible.  

I will never have wings here again.  Go to Buffalo Wild Wings if you are craving wings!"}
{"text":"I walked in,,ordered a beer and the bartender grabs a filthy napkin from a filthy disgusting napkin holder!  It all went downhill from there!  The outside bar was absolutely filthy!  She just stood around and did nothing, maybe she should clean the bar!  I ordered the \"crispy porkbelly tacos\" and they came out looking like slimy chicken, no crispiness, all fat and gross!  So stupid me orders wings to go and they were nasty.  I ask the bartender for my bill and she tells me it's $38.00, I figured about $29.00, so I again her for the paper bill and my total amazingly came to $32.00, hmmm!?  Was she adding an extra 6.00 for her tip?  Last time I EVER go here!  A manager who cares needs to be hired!"}
{"text":"Visited 1/2013, Cleveland Ohio Airport  - Great breakfast, and service. Priced right."}
{"text":"Great food and best milkshake ever. Here on vacation we are going back again today to try the chicken wings."}
{"text":"I get it, work sucks.... especially at a chain sports bar/restaurant serving up wings and other greasy specialties to a mostly unsavory clientele.  However, when you are a hostess you are the first impression of that restaurant, and you set the tone for the experience a customer is about to have.  In my case, I should've known what to expect when my boyfriend and I walked in.  At most establishments, a hostess would greet you and make you feel welcome.  Instead, we got nothing.....absolutely nothing.  There were two young ladies at the hostess stand, but they just looked at us. We didn't know what to do so we wandered off looking for somewhere to sit, however all of the tables looked dirty.  We went back to the hostess area and approached them on what we should do.  Finally got a table, but we were worried that our service was going to be just as bad.  Luckily our server was pleasant and helpful.  Maybe it was because we came in on the All you Can Eat Wing night, but the wings were not even worth the price they charged, almost $15 for a dozen wings. They seemed old, tired and lukewarm.  The flavor of the Golden Garlic Sauce I chose was really good, however it would've tasted better on a hot wing.  With all the competition out there (ahem, Jammy Buggars, 25 cent wing nights on Thursdays) Quaker Steak really needs to step it up."}
{"text":"Gets one star for having Biker Night on Wednesday with a band and bar setup outside. (I wish I had taken pictures.) We walked from our hotel trying to figure out where to eat.  There were 4 choices - PF Chang's (done last night as a group), Abuelo's (where I ate Monday), Apple-bee's and Quaker Steak and Lube (which was closest).   

As we walk up we notice that there is an employee directing the bikers where to park, \"Please get close.\"   Not a good sign, but still we send in scouts to see how long the wait it.  Apparently the crowd is outside because they are able to seat our party of nine immediately.  

Their menu is big; steaks, wings, ribs, burgers, etc.   A number of the party had steaks, the rest chicken wings.   It was a messy meal for me, but good.  Service was good given the number of people that were there.  Granted this is not the place to be a wine snob, but it was a good time.  Loved the atmosphere, the bikers really added to it."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak and Lube is my new favorite place to go for wings. They have a large menu and offer a myriad of appetizers, entrees, and dessert. This Independence location is huge! There are two bars and plenty of dinning area seating. I chose to sit at the bar to watch the Cavs game. I was pleasantly surprised that on Friday night they have $3.50 long islands! If you like long islands I recommend getting one, they were very strong. The bartender was nice and offered suggestions for menu items. We ended up taking her advice for the wing sauce and ordering nachos. The food was soooo good and we were very satisfied with the meal. I recommend Quaker Steak and Lube. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here twice this past week. Once was on a weekday during the lunch buffet. We really enjoyed that and found it a good value. We loved taco day and thought it was nice to eat tacos and wings! We really liked the wing selection and it was cool to try all the sauces! My favorite? Medium. I didn't like buckeye bbq. My husband loves any that are garlic. The salad bar was great. We enjoyed being able to have a fast lunch! Our second trip was during the weekend they were a bit busier but we were still treated with the same friendly service. Good was awesome! Even our kids were happy. As always I love the atmosphere and the car decor. We will be back"}
{"text":"On Friday, June 22, 2018 between 7:15 pm to 10:00 pm was my family and I worst experience at your establishment.  Not only we waited 45 minutes to be seated, once seated we waited almost 1 hour for 24 wings, onion rings, baked potato and a chicken club sandwich and we had a very inattentive waitress. We couldn't understand why was the wait was so long, because when I looked around the restaurant, there were at least 5 or more tables open.
Everyone who was seated after us, got served their food prior to us.  Our waitress didn't provide us an update on our food, she could've said \"sorry for the wait, your food will be up shortly\" or give us a time frame when our food was going to be ready. Where I was sitting I can observe her standing near the door way of the kitchen having a good conversation with the staff, therefore she was aware of what was happening in the kitchen.  
She rarely came to our table to see if we needed anything, she only came to our table to:
1. To take our initial drink order 
2. Brought drinks to the table and took our food order
3. Took second drink order
4. Brought drinks to the table
5. Brought us the check and to-go box
She had no hesitation giving us our $123.00 bill which also included 6 shots of Jack Daniels and 4 Angry Orchards.  2 hours later we left without someone saying \"thank you for your patience\" or \"sorry for the wait or inconvenience\", your establishment showed lack empathy. 
My family and I are from the east side of Cleveland, for us to travel to you Valley View location and get treated the way we did is unacceptable.  That would be our last time visiting your establishment.  I hope you find this letter of complaint helpful to improving your customer service."}
{"text":"This place has a special every single day. There is literally something going on all the time! Every weekday from 11A-2P they have all you can eat wing buffet. They also show ALL the major sporting events (INCLUDING UFC FIGHTS.) Everytime we go there is something new on the menu and the service is consistently good. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was terrible; the place was severely understaffed. Only 3 people working during dinner hours in a place that seats 30 (chef, waiter, bartender). When I sat down the waiter didn't get to me for 10 minutes, and when she did she said it'd be a 30 minute wait to order food since the kitchen was backed up. Had a 2 hour wait for my plane anyways, so I waited. 

You're likely better off going to TGIF or Chik-fil-A."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. The place is great for friends and family. Great selection in wing sauces. The service is awesome. Bike night is amusing and great wing specials through out the week. 32oz beers for $4 dollars. 100 OZ of beer for $9.99! Great outdoor area."}
{"text":"This Quaker Steak and Lube was TERRIBLE. There was one waitress for the entire restaurant. We ordered fries and 2 orders of boneless wings. The fries came out in about 20 minutes but the wings took AN HOUR. The waitress was nowhere to be seen between that time. We asked to talk to a manager and she said \"he went home and left us with a new girl and the cook is 'out'\", whatever that meant. Her only saving grace was she didn't make us pay for the wings. Service was awful and she didn't even apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"What a cool fun place. Brought our two grandsons and in laws there and had a ball. Food was good and presentation and wait staff did a good job.
Will return again with any grandkids. The menu suited all of our needs including the cheese curds and chicken fingers. If you haven't been to this chain, you won't be sorry if you're bringing kids."}
{"text":"Love the wings and the Buffalo chicken mac and cheese....great that you can go through the drive thru and be on your way!!"}
{"text":"Solid place to grab some food before your flight in Pittsburgh. Sat at the bar with attentive and friendly service. There are plenty of options on the menu, but the wings are probably the most popular. They do a pretty good job with them. Not the best I've ever, but a good job nonetheless. You may need an extra side of blue cheese or ranch as the containers are pretty small. Also a good spot to catch a game while you wait on your flight with several TVs mounted behind the bar."}
{"text":"My most favorite place for wings! I love how they do the wings themselves. I prefer crispy skin over the battered grease sponge version of wings. Quaker Steak & Lube does perfectly crisp skin, and the quality of their chicken is good. Not the best quality I've had, but not bad by any means. Their sauces are tasty, but their scale of hot is a little bit off I think. Their ranch for dipping is good, but still not as good as Hooters.  I LOVE their beer sizes! At other places I have to end up ordering a few but here I can just order one huge beer! The service has always been great, prompt, thorough, and polite. The server always brings wipes right away so you don't have to ask for such an obvious thing. You get Twizzlers with the bill :)
The atmosphere is quirky fun perfection. If my boyfriend and I are in town on game day, we usually go here to see the Bears. They have plenty of TVs showing a variety of games, and you can always spot someone else cheering for they same team you are!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous! Our waitress was absolutely unavailable during our visit and the restaurant was empty so their was no excuse. I did see our waitress socializing with her co workers instead of waiting tables. As for the food I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was incredibly dry, unfortunately I was hungry so I finished it instead of complaining. On top of the horrendous food, our waitress clearly didn't understand the order of how a meal is suppose to be she instead served the entrees before the appetizers which for another words shows a lack of training at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for bike night and various other occasions.  Same bar food and tall-ass beers as all the other Quakers.  Staff is always nice, even when the place is packed with suburban rebels draped head to toe in coordinating Harley and Affliction gear.  I could imagine this is where Sonny Barger would of hung out, had he sat when he peed and wore womens panties..."}
{"text":"Bike nite..cheap beers and wings!

We come here often.  Great location down in the Valley!  Wings are some of my favorite.  Never really have had anything bad here and if I have they fix it pretty quick.  Wings can come out a tad underdone sometimes thats why I get extra crispy.  The service has gotten a LOT better lately.  Dont know if they have a new manager but its way more customer friendly, even on busy days.  They started doing happy hour specials at bar only for a bit but have recently gona back to having it at sit down tables too...deals just not as good as they used to be.  With so many bars in the area doing wing/beers specials for happy hr why would I pay full price?  Servers are pretty good and genuinely seem like they want to make money.  Most of the bartenders are total flakes though...still dont know where they find these people..."}
{"text":"Whoa baby..  Ok, I was driving through Flakewood and saw this new place was open.  We go to the Valley View and Sheffield one sometimes.  I walk in, place looks good..spankin new.  There is a karaoke band playing i think...(think Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer doing that Christian thing on SNL)..rediculous..  I ask the bartender what drink and  food specials they have...what a novel idea..  After about 10 minutes of her asking other (whom which are busy breaking down the bar, mind you) she telsl me and I order.  One would think a bartender would know about what specials are going on.  I order one drink and wings.  Wings good..drink..is all mix.  Giving the benefit of the doubt I order another drink..big mistake.  In watching her make said drink she LITERALLY puts 1oz of liquor in what is supposed to be their version of a Long Island.  Now folks, anyone in Lakewood would know you can go to ANY corner bar and get a WAYYYY better drink for the same dough!  So, I tell the manager to switch it to a beer..in which he did, but without asking me why..lol.  This is the same dude I saw give a cigarette from his pocket to a buddy over the bar.  Thats rock star stuff..tool..  Finished my beer, ate my wings and paid.  All the Quaker Steakes in the area seem to hire total morons or something...Ive worked in the service industry and eat and drink out all the time.  This company STILL messes it up consistantly..WTF..    SIDE NOTE:  MAYBE IF YA HAVE 3 BARTENDERS PRESENT DURING BUSINESS HOURS, THEY SHOULD WAIT ON CUSTOMERS....INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE DIRTY FLOORMATS UP ON THE END OF THE BAR AND WIPING DOWN THE BAR WITH A DIRTY RAG??  ISNT THAT FOR AFTER YOU CLOSE??"}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself looking for a great place to dine out I kick around a few ideas but always end up going to Quaker Steak. Love, love, love their food, prices, atmosphere, the whole shebang!
Their wraps are to die for. Their loaded french fries--um...YUM! Chicken wings?! Sign me up!
I love everything about this place. They take excellent care of every customer beginning with their friendly staffers down to the licorice and warm wipes at the end of every meal.
Seriously, if you haven't been here you're missing out. Go and you'll become a regular like me! 
And be sure to stop in on a Wednesday evening now that it's summertime for Bike Night! Awesome bands are always rocking out outside!"}
{"text":"1st time there at the medina, oh location & last.   The plus- waitress/service was good but oh what small portions on the chicken.  They only have one kind of bone in on wing orders & they call these jumbo wings on the menu..  well they are far from jumbo, you only get 6, cost 7.99 & are the same size as frozen wings you get wallmart.   Best advice skip the wings or just go to bw3"}
{"text":"I have to agree the some of the other reviews here, the food is mediocre and the service is awful slow.  Too pricey for the quality of the food everything is frozen, the cocktails are too watery, good selection of beers tho!, and the size of wings are good too, the sauces not good at all.  I ordered wings with some kind of thai sauce that were mmeeehh. The pork sliders were dry and cold.  Overall very sad experience here, i'd never return here, better places in lakewood."}
{"text":"They have the best sauces ever and their mozzarella sticks are bomb. Anyone who expects the waiting service at this location to be superb is expecting a little too much. It's run by a bunch of college kids. I eat here all the time and I think it's better than bdubs."}
{"text":"Oh the Kentucky Bourbon Molasses wings are AWESOME!  The wife had a Blood Mary.....she said it was her best one ever!  Only downer here was the service.  I saw the other waiters and waitresses flying around serving their tables.  Ours was hardly around and had excuse after excuses and the place was not crowded at all.  Beside that we had a great time here!"}
{"text":"Was in Wisconsin so I figured I would check it out. Ordered a 5 piece wing at the take out window. Waited for 25 minutes before I asked for a manager and asked to credit me. So I guess I'll never know. Oh well no big loss!"}
{"text":"garbage.   ive never had such bad service in my entire life. im not sure if my waitress was stoned or a moron, or maybe she was just a stoned moron. she literally fucked up the whole tables order the whole night,  not one time did she apologize either. for a minute i thought i was on a hidden camera prank show.not only did she not put our food order in she took my drink to get a refill and i shit you not didnt bring it back at all. literally didnt bring me a drink back, i told her 3 times about my drink and the chick just laughed and said sorry but the idiot still didnt bring it, so i asked for the check and wouldnt you know it it also was fucked up.  she tried to charge me for beers no one ordered. and thats just the service lets talk about the food for a wing place their wings suck, you can tell they were boiled to the extreme.  fancy greasy sauce wont save garbage cooking ever."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill and fast. Extremely long wait times, cold food, missing side-dishes. Very poor quality of food mixed with an unfriendly staff left our family time ruined. Did I mention we were celebeating my nephews high school graduation? We wasted time and memories we can never get back. We went home hungry. Wrote to corporate and never heard back. Not surprised highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Good wings and friendly staff. Got the bucket of 25 wing and 5 flavors. I enjoyed the medium wings the best. The Louisiana lockers were nice too."}
{"text":"Love the quick casual service and the fun atmosphere. Great for family and friends."}
{"text":"So I haven't been here in a while. I had the day off & thought it would be great to have a couple of beers & some wings. Kristen B was my bartender. Took my drink order, gave me a menu & went to the other end of the bar and stayed for about 10 minutes. There were 6 of us sitting at the bar & she decided to flirt with 2 guys at the other end. By the time she made her way back (roughly 10 minutes) I was done with my beer. I had questions like why doesn't the menu say how many wings come in these weird names. I waited too long. Cashed out & left. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"we came here for team trivia tonight. the service is terrible, and the food is even worse. we just ordered pretzels with beer cheese dip... the pretzels were fried (?) and greasy, and the \"beer cheese\" dip resembled canned gravy more than beer or cheese. gross. i've managed to avoid this place for four years, and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, some of the best wing sauces I have EVER tried & great service. Everyone who I meet here is happy to work here and all the customers are so excited this place has opened that the excitement is contagious!"}
{"text":"We were staying in town for a few nights to visit a friend, and this location wasn't far from our hotel.  The first night, we stopped by to get some to-go wings (just before closing) to eat back at the room.  We ordered with Rachel at the bar, who was very friendly, helpful, and attentive, despite the late hour, next-to-last-minute order, and some questions.

The food, and the attitude, were so nice, we came back for dinner the next day.  The food was great, we loved the \"boom boom\" wings we'd gotten the night before, and decided to try the \"haute parm\" wings with them this time, as well as an attempt at the \"Triple Atomic\" hot wing \"challenge\" for myself.  \"Boom Boom\" is definitely the winner on flavor, though I'll probably get the \"Haute Parm\" again, they mostly tasted like black pepper and had huge shavings of parmesan cheese all over them, with a creamy buffalo-style sauce.  

The \"triple atomic\" challenge is 6 of their hottest wings for the price of 9, so you're practically buying the t-shirt that comes with the \"challenge,\" plus you get your name on the wall (at the end of the month; our friend might snap a pic of it for me).  The 500,000 scoville unit wings are very, very hot, but before the burn hits, and off and on during the whole experience, there's a very strong and sweet flavor almost like concentrated sweet cherries?  Think cherry pie, not cherry cough syrup.  I managed to get them all down with a single cup of blue cheese and no drink, but each of the people at the table went red-faced and started sweating after one lick of the sauce, so your mileage may vary.  Definitely something I'll do again.

The best part of that evening, however, was our server, Jeff.  In contrast to reviews I've seen below for other waiters and waitresses, who are often dead-eyed, rude and scowling at worst or artificially cheery and absentminded at best, in similar chain restaurants or bars...  Jeff came off as full of energy, very genuine and honestly friendly, and his commentary and checking-in was not unwelcome, forced, or grating like it can often be.  This sounds cheesy, but it was like having a friend checking in at our table every now and then, though we'd never met the guy.

Bonus points:  Two people in our party were transgender males, and he gendered them correctly (greeted us all as \"gentlemen\") without the slightest bit of hesitation or questioning inflection, which (intentional or not) made them both feel a lot more comfortable and had them both smiling and mentioning how nice it was as soon as he left the table to get our drinks.

Good job, Jeff."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised that this place is still open - they never seem busy, other than bike night and car nights during the summer.  I pulled into Quaker Steak around 5:30p on a Wednesday night and there might have been 10 other cars in the lot.  I sat at the bar and waited for the rest of my group to arrive.  There were two occupied tables in the bar area and about 10 other people at the bar.  It seemed like half of those people at the bar were off-duty employees.  The bartender was nice and quick to get my drink but the price was way out of whack - almost $7 for a double vodka (rail)....isn't it supposed to be happy hour?

When the rest of my party arrived we were seated in the dining area, in a booth.  There were a few more occupied tables than the bar but it was still pretty quiet.  And whenever I'm here it always seems like there's a bunch of employees just wandering around - severely over-staffed.  

Our waiter was quick to greet us and get our drinks.  He returned promptly to take our food order as well.  We got the 4-wheeler appetizer which consisted of two soft pretzel sticks, some onion rings, 4 deep-fried pickles and 4 mozzarella sticks.  We also ordered two buckets of wings.  Everything came out really hot and as ordered.  We were given plenty of ranch for the wings too.

Quaker Steak is always clean and most of the staff is friendly, but I just can't get over their prices.  One drink, one appetizer and a bucket of approximately 18 wings ran us $45...not including tip.  As we left, I noticed that PF Chang's (next doors) was extremely quiet too.  Abuelo's (other side of PF Chang's) closed over a year ago...I think it's just a matter of time before these two places go too.  There are just way too many delicious options in the Madison area that aren't franchises."}
{"text":"If you like wings, this place is a must! They have lots of varieties of flavors and sauces to choose from. The Buckeye BBQ is fantastic, and the Buffalo wings taste like actual Buffalo wings. A lot of bars and pubs can't get this classic simple recipe right for some reason. The wings are nice and meaty, not the scrawny pigeon wings like you get at \"some\" places (*ahem* B-Dubs)."}
{"text":"It is a glorified sports bar. Similar to Buffalo Wild Wings except not as loud and better food. This Quaker Steak has a large seating area so you rarely have to wait to be seated. They also to carry out orders. They are reasonably priced for their food selection."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch.  Well quick is what they do best here.  Food. Well that could be desired.  I know why three stars is the average!! Let me explain. I also want you all to know I haven't been to QSL in two years. 
First.  The lunch buffet does NOT include chicken wings. Isn't that what this place is known for?  Ok whatever!!!  Good thing is they had boneless wings on the table.  Bad news is the boneless wings tasted freezer burn.  Not appetizing!!!   But I did taste all the sauces available. See picture. 
Second.  The plates were DIRTY on the line. I went through the first four before I found a clean plate. Come on.  Wtf!!!!   The managers or someone said don't we have a dishwasher. When he tried to grab a plate and found at least two more.  After I got my plate. 
It was pasta day on the line. So they had four different pastas.  I will give the pastas four stars for sure. Tastes really good. 
The chili was very tasty. Good seasoning.  BUT. stay away from the Poblano soup concoction.  It was disgusting and isn't fit for anyone. No seasoning. Weird taste. Like it was cooked and served. Then put in cooler overnight and placed back out for the customers to enjoy. But enjoy I did not. It was disgusting!!!!  Oh btw. Did I mention the soup was disgusting!!!!!
Finally the desert table looked amazing.  Until I took my first bite.  The chocolate cake was so dried out. It had to be frozen. And thawed.  Go figure. Doubtful freshness is top priority here.  Well now I know why it's been two years since I've been here.  And it may be that long again. But maybe I'll come back after a couple months to see if they fixed the issues. Who knows. 
AND FOR GOD SAKES.  PUT CHICKEN WINGS ON A BUFFET IF YOU ARE KNOWN FOR YOUR CHICKEN WINGS AND SAUCES."}
{"text":"YUM YUM
I've been to a few locations for this franchise...WI, OH and IL...none of whcih ever disappoint...I almost always get a really nice server...they're usually really helpful when you're asking for suggestions and such
I usually order the wings with Buckeye BBQ sauce and pretzels...but even that's too much to eat for one person...
This particular location has a great outdoor patio with tvs, lots of fresh air and great servers...perfect location for the businesses nearby."}
{"text":"Came here twice: once for the wings buffet and once for entrees. I got a free appetizer the pulled pork over chips. And I got a steak medium rare. It was decent for good that isn't my favorite cuisine. Everything is rich and saucy here. Lots of cheese and flavors!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now. Every time has been good. Pork shank is excellent. Open-faced pulled pork is good, but a bit salty. Tacos are exceptional."}
{"text":"After the zero service from  competition across the lot, we could not have asked for any better than here.   The boom boom sauce was the perfect amount of spice when coupled with the bed of slaw cradling the shrimp!   The waitress was outstanding and very attentive.   The quality of food and service is the same excellence we see at the Quaker Steak back home!  Great job!"}
{"text":"I was just at this Quaker Steak yesterday afternoon, and the staff there did something unbelievable. They took what could have been my worst restaurant experience, and turned it around into something amazing.

I brought my father in in the early afternoon. He has been having severe back problems as of late, but wanted to get out and grab wings together. Upon entering, the hostess took us to our table. My dad made it about half way, and his back fully gave out. He couldn't move, and was stuck in pain in the hallway outside of the bathroom.

The hostess and server jumped into action. They immediately got him a chair to sit in right there, while I grabbed him a pain pill and his walker. They then gave him some water, and proceeded to chat with us for the next 15 minutes or so.

To put this in perspective, we were right smack in the middle of the main walkway to the tables, taking up over half the space. The staff did not see this as inconvenient, however. Their main concern was my dad's well being.

Once he was up to it, they helped walk him out of the building. It was slow going, and he had to stop and sit about four times along the way. The staff and I basically carried him. They helped him to my car, held the doors, and everything.

During the whole ordeal, we took an order for a couple of buckets of wings to go. The hostess insisted that they would handle the charge, and just wanted to see my dad back again, all healed up.

The whole ordeal was totally selfless on the part of Quaker Steak and their staff. I will not only be going back again, but recommending others.

Oh, and the wings were delicious."}
{"text":"QSaL is our guilty pleasure - significantly better options than BWW, and far less of a wait than the Winking Lizard down the road.

I cannot resist their fried pickles - every time I go in, I think I'll try something else, but then a set of crispy pickles go by and I have to have them.

The wings are a decent size and generously sauced, with some pretty diverse flavors.  I got a split single pack of Thaisian and Golden Garlic - pretty much the perfect amount of spice for me... Well, perhaps they could be just a little more hot, both in spice and in temperature.

At the end of the meal, they bring you a hot wet nap - don't be shy, you're probably covered in spicy sauce no matter how hard you try, and cleaning up will be a relief.

The staff was perfectly friendly and accommodating all the way around."}
{"text":"Good place set up for good entertainment outside with a concert stage. This place makes me feel like a MAN! beer! wings! car stuff!"}
{"text":"Quaker has better wings than buffalo wild wings, and that is an indisputable fact. However, the prices seem to have gone up quite a bit over the last couple years and is not nearly the value it used to be. On top of that, the staff here has become uninviting and rather rude; on every single visit this has been an issue. There's a fellow that works the bar most of the time that seems to dislike anyone that walks in. The bar area staff really make the experience unpleasant. Our waiter the other day mixed up our checks, went to \"fix\" them and had them mixed up in a different manner. 

That being said, come for the great wings and beer, and enjoy the absurd amount of Tv's blasting any relevant sporting event, but don't expect good, let alone friendly service. 

2.5 stars out of 5. Would have given it 5 out of 5 some years ago, but the staff and inflated prices have ruined it for me."}
{"text":"The Lube!  gotta try the Lubeburger."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited QSL for the first time with high hopes, but we were both let down. We started with wings with mild sauce, which weren't bad. The wings are much bigger than at BWW. I ordered a cheeseburger and he ordered chicken tenders. The burger was just ok; for a steak burger I expected a little more flavor. Hubby said his chicken wings were \"just okay,\" but he's had better. The service was very spotty. Our server was slow with refills and checking on us, probably because he was more interested in checking out the Packers game. 

Would we come back and give it another chance in the future?  Sure. Would we go out of our way to come back to a QSL?  Probably not."}
{"text":"So we pulled in for a pit stop at Quaker Steak and Lube, looking to fill up before moving on with the evening. Topped off first with a couple beverages and settled in to order. First thing I notice is the place is a little loud, but that is because it is PACKED. The traffic jam runs throughout, and it speaks to the quality of the place.
     The service is friendly if not fast, and I understand a few delays with the rush of so many people there. I get the loaded baked potato soup and the ribs, with fiery bbq sauce and cinammon apples on the side. We wait our turn, and in a short while our food arrives. Those ribs were smoking, not from spice but from being fresh out of the oven.
     I dig into the baby backs and find they're not quite meaty enough to satisfy. The cinammon apples are delicious and make a nice side for the slightly sweet bbq sauce, which I got on the low end of the mildly hot scale. The sauce selection here is unbelievable, and the sly pallete can make wonderful flavor combos quickly. A brownie with ice cream completed my meal nicely, but the finest touch was the manager coming over to promise me the meatiest ribs in the house on my next visit!"}
{"text":"No - No - No - did I say NO?

I have only gone to one other Quaker Steak and Lube and this one certainly sealed the deal for me never going back.

The food was mediocre at best - the buffet - NO MEAT LOAF! The time it takes to get what you order was also a nightmare - chips and salsa - over 45 minutes? 

Cleanliness NOT next to godliness here by any means. The only good thing is price, but I don't necessarily chose my places based on price.

The manager attempted to please me, but false advertisement mixed with staff rudeness = 1 star - I wish there was a rating of 0 - though this place does deserve one star!"}
{"text":"one of my familys favorites always excellent service been here probaly been heren15 times only had one small issue got onion when asked without but was fixed asap good wings nice variety from so hot they bring you gloves for hubby to mild for me good selection of entree from burgers and sandwich steak pasta fish taco were very good i enjoyed the ribs hubby thought they were a little too sweet good apps liked boom boom shrimp and the pretzels good kids menu kids love the little cardboard cars they come in generally around 50 dollars before tip for family of 5"}
{"text":"They have have live music every Friday during the summer, I believe.  This is a fun place to come to before or after a movie (there's a nearby movie theatre) to relax outside and enjoy drinks and music with good friends.  Gotta love their wings, too."}
{"text":"Decent wait staff- Ribs are dry and chicken wings overcooked. Stay away from mac-n-cheese!!! And those plastic chairs are only good for the skinny folks!!! GET BETTER CHAIRS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really, really good wings.  Worth seeking out at the airport for quick meal before a flight. The original quaker steak sauced wings are the best.  Fresh wings, cooked perfectly crispy, with the sauce having great balance of heat and sweet.  So good, the sauce, you can buy some and bring it home which is what I ended up doing."}
{"text":"what happened?? use to be a great place for bike night but the last few times have been terrible and very un organized !!! An hour to wait for a table, stale food pre cooked outside and the parking was terrible no roped off area for over flow like they used to have. won't be there much again for the price there is many better establishments such as winking  lizard on the hill ..."}
{"text":"The wings are not all that large but are tasty. The server was nice but the food and drinks took a lot too long."}
{"text":"Stopped into eat while attending the 2011 ironman.  There was also a Badger football game going one so the place was packed.  Even though we had over 10 people in our group they seated us as soon as they could.  Staff was very friendly, service was prompt and food really good.  Would go back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I got a good deal on a Groupon for the new Quaker Steak & Lube so we stopped in for a late lunch last week.  There were only a few patrons in the restaurant at that time.  It was so slow, in fact, that it seemed that we were a bother to the hostess because she really couldn't seem less interested in seating us.  Thankfully, our server made up for her shortcomings, plus some.  He was fantastic.  Very attentive and very personable.

If only the food was as good as the service.  Ugh...such a let down!  I ordered Mild Wings.  The sauce was ok, but the skin was too soft.  My son got the Medium spiced wings and he said that they were ok, but that he's had better.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and said it was acceptable.  Nothing special, but not terrible either.  He also got a small order of Cajun spiced boneless wings.  I tried them and the flavor was NOT appealing to me at all.  The one saving grace for the entire meal were the onion rings.  A tad too salty, but perfectly crispy and not greasy.  My son and I liked them very much.

The decor is a bit gaudy, but I'm fairly certain that's by design.  I'm glad that we were seated at a booth because the plastic lawn chairs at the standard tables would have been very uncomfortable.  The only downside to the booth was that I was a bit grossed out by how filthy the framed picture was that was hanging over our booth.  It looked like some kids smeared their dirty hands all over the picture.  Seriously, it was disgusting and it even had an odor.  And speaking of odors...there was an odor in the restaurant that reminded of me the remnants of water damage.  It was really off-putting.

So...it wasn't a good lunch at all and we won't be back.  It's a shame because the concept of the restaurant is cool and the menu \"looked\" great."}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Kids like the burgers and fries.  Appetizers are good !
Good for a large party. 
Music is sometimes loud but after all the conversations you don't notice .
I think the food is pretty good and a big variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Polite but inattentive service. Beer was cold but the side order of carrots and celery yielded this... those carrots have probably been drying out for a few days before they were served....The first and last time I steer into a Quaker Steak and Lube....

If the only thing a chain knows is how to fry feed then don't serve dried out carrots...It's called FOCUS!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this chain. Finally had a chance to stop on our way through town. I wasn't sure if I was in for a truck stop type feel or something classy. I was happy find find a good medium. Place was clean and decor was interesting to look at. Server was very friendly, and wings were okay. I loved that we got a hot towelette at the end to wipe off the sauces. 

I would sill prefer Duff's over this, but it was a good second."}
{"text":"Initial delivery of wings were dry and crunchy. They replaced the wings, but offered no discount for having to wait. Linda disappointing."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak and Lube was part of our SWPA, tri-state area, fatty, foodie, fest.

I brought my dining companion here because Wednesdays are for wings! We went full boar and ordered this bucket of wings with several different flavors. The garlic, and thai teriyaki, were my favorites. It's nice to see my old favorites on the menu and a few new flavors along side them.

Beers were cold, girls were cute, and we had plenty of wet naps for our grubby little paws. Until next time Quaker Steak and Lube!"}
{"text":"Honestly I think I would have been better off with a quart of 10W-40 then this place.  We ate here on our way back to the airport, I should have waited for the peanuts on the plane.  Here's the breakdown of what I got.

Stick Shifters described as followed \" Wisconsin mozzarella coated with zesty garlic crumbs, with fresh Parmesan and marinara aside\"  WRONG!  This shit is Sonic like cheese sticks fried in grease that probably hasnt changed since the Pirates won the World Series in 1979 and served with something resembling ketchup

Grilled Boneless Wings: Tyson like chicken with cartiledge still attached.  Might as well have been boiled. NO FLAVOR.  They claim to have \"practically invented them\" They should not brag about this.  This place makes Applebee's look like a 5 star dining experience."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak and Lube is an excellent wing place with one of my most frequented locations being in Medina. We arrived on Tuesday for there $10 deals. For those of you looking for all you can eat wings, I'm sorry to say you will have to venture to the North Canton location, as this smaller location doesn't offer it, and offers many deals on Tuesday instead. Not really a loss in my opinion however, as I can get 10 jumbo bone in wings and a sidecar (side) for $10; and the wings are BIG. The Medina location also stays a lot less slammed on Tuesday, and therefore is very easy to get into without a 30 minute wait, unlike the North Canton location.

I ordered my usual 10 jumbo bone in wings with Arizona Ranch sauce, (a must have) as well as a large baked potato for my sidecar. The wings were large, hot, and tasty, however could've used a little more sauce. My potato was satisfying as well, of which I have no real complaints. We were very satisfied overall. (as usual)

The service was excellent. I want to give much thanks to Melissa who served as our waitress, as she was very attentive, polite, and quickly brought us more ranch sauce as needed.

All in all, if your looking to get your hands on some delicious wings and eat till you want to explode, look no further than Quaker Steak and Lube. They'll give you just that, and excellent service to boot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"the baked potato was impossibly good to be true but it was! the steamed broccoli was so so delicious and the beer cheese.... oh my.. it was DEFINITELY DELICIOUS! you guys should come to this place!

{"text":"As I noted, if I returned I would update.  Here is that update.  Honestly, the only reason I went back was because I was invited for a birthday celebration - so I basically went for the people and not the restaurant.

After my initial review, I was asked to email the company.  After hesitating a couple weeks I finally sent an email to see what they had to say.  To this day I have not received a reply.

This visit occurred on an \"All You Can Eat Wings\" Tuesday.  I made the decision to go with the wing special.  The wings are so-so and the flavors are boring. To me it just seems overpriced, especially since they don't include fries anymore - but instead allow you to munch on a sad nacho bar which is never restocked. All of the food just seems pricey at QSL in general.

Knowing that this location and the Concord location are owned by the same company I expected a lot more out of them.  Even though the service and food in Concord is so-so.

The previous businesses in that location, for some reason, have just failed to succeed.  Hopefully they continue to make it.  

I don't feel the need to return.  You can make your own decisions.

This is just an honest from-the-heart review (update) from a paying customer."}
{"text":"I get that some (I look at you, Laura!) may have issues with \"lube\" in the restaurant name.  Really, I do.  But frankly, I kinda dig it.  Unfortunately - or fortunately, perhaps - the only lube here is the drinking kind, and for that, the results are really atypical.  You can order beer, and being just down the road from the Speedway, you might want to do so.

Even better, they have a full bar, and if you are not quite sure what you want, and get the right server/bartender, you can ask them for help and they can actually do a reasonable job at making something to meet your needs.  Or so I am told.  A couple of people in our group took advantage and were quite pleased.

The mixology actually extends to the kitchen as well.  If you find that you may not be able to decide on one of the dozen or so wing sauces (somewhat similar to the selection at BW3), they will mix and match.  Or even create a new concoction, which could even find its way onto the menu one day.  Nice touch.

As to the food itself?  The wings are fairly average, but the personal service pushed them over the top.  The best thing I had here was actually the pretzel appetizer.  I could have eaten them all night long.  In fact, I want to go get some now and stick my face in a vat of the beer cheese dip."}
{"text":"Very very mediocre food.  Wings a bit above average but almost no one else in the group could say anything about their lunch but \"Ehh\".  Service was good, some decent beer selections but overall, definition of \"so so\" food."}
{"text":"Being the self-proclaimed \"Wing King\" it's a must that anytime I'm in Madison I make a stop at QS&L. The ambiance is kind of annoying... Okay, it's really annoying, but the food here is bomb and I've never had a weak drink...

We usually roll with the Supercharged wings as they're the spiciest available that still have a good, bold flavor to them. Their wings are always steaming hot, and PLUMP PLUMP PLUMP!  No bullshit third world chicken wings here. And that I can definitely respect!

During my last visit, after taking down a double order of Supercharged wings, I was challenged by my party to eat the new Triple Atomic wing because I was \"scared and a pussy.\" Since I'm so easy to get to when it comes to such things (mainly food challenges) I decided to take on 500,000 SHU. Six beautiful wings came out with a red siren and rubber gloves, hahahaha. I wore just one of the gloves as an ode to Michael Jackson and went to work. They were definitely spicy, but nothing the King couldn't handle. The only thing that sucked was at about wing #4 my right eye started sweating and the spice laden sweat oozed from my pores and got into my eyeball forcing me to finish my plate looking like a damn cyclops. I finished though. Thanks for the free drinks, boys. THE WING KING LIVES ON."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best wings in Pittsburgh. I am particularly partial to the Cajun and Haute Parm, (a red hot, black pepper & parmesan concoction). I've even tried the super charged (silly hot) and the Atomic (wet your pants hot). I've never had the Triple Atomic as I fear the pain that would incur (in &  out). 

The rest of the menu is pretty meh. Not at all bad, but nothing memorable either. The bar area is nice but not exactly a craft beer mecca. Expect the normal selection of domestics and large imports. 

Best deal is Tuesdays for the all you can eat wings &  tacos. A great chance to try lots of flavors with no risk."}
{"text":"What a filthy mess. Assigned a seat with sauce all over the tabletop. Saw the ice refilled in the soft drink machine and she placed the inside of the food surface lid in the dirty counter, replaced the lid by pushing the ice down, then counter was wiped. Nasty place; but what can you expect from college students. #DinersLivesMatter."}
{"text":"My husband flew in late and was hungry so we stopped into QSL for wings. Because it was late the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were greeted immediately and seated quickly. Our server came over and took our drink order. She was very personable. I ordered Louisiana Lickers wings with Magna fries. The Magna Fries are fries topped with bacon and cheese. The fries were hot. The cheese was stretchy and gooey. Yum!  The wings were fresh and hot. They had a nice amount of sauce on them. They definitely hit the spot. We were thankful for the wipes our server brought us to clean our hands. 
Our visit to QSL was quick but the food was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"The best time to go to QSL is on All You Can Eat Wing night. You get to taste a variety of wings. You will have to wait because it's busy but it's a great way to taste all of their sauces. As part of the All You Can Eat Wing night they also have a buffet with salad, fries, pizza, and other foods. I recommend you skip the pizza. If we go on a regular night I like to get their boneless salad. 
Their menu is big. There is a lot to choose from. It's all pretty good. Great place for families."}
{"text":"The worst  place to eat it was better before  I reall don't recommended the buffet  used to have better stuff."}
{"text":"A long time ago, I visited this same chain restaurant up in PA. It was fun, fast and wings are great.

This restaurant , despite having the same name does not produce the same effect. I think the employees can try a little harder and inject some  energy into the place. Look over at Twin Peaks.. its bright, cheery, energetic.."}
{"text":"Met a friend here before I had to return home to the Bay. I used to really like stopping at QS&L in Sharon, PA years ago when we would go down to the outlet shops and have always been a fan. The Mentor location was large and occupies the old Chi-Chi's building. We sat at the outdoor bar (one of two bars) and enjoyed the atmosphere on a warm and breezy evening. Service was good, but not very educated on beer beyond the macros. When I tried a local IPA, I was surprised to note hints of corriander and clove. When I commented to the bartender, he said \"it is Indian\". WTF??? Got a chuckle out of that. Otherwise the wings were fresh and the Hot BBQ sauce (I think that's what it is called) was fantastic! Overall the place was clean, family friendly (wish it weren't), and fun. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is decent. The atmosphere is well, cozy with a lot if people packed in. The last time I was here the TVs were too loud along with all the customers packed in. Just because a local team is playing doesn't mean the TVs need to be turned up and everyone in the restaurant loud. We came here to eat and not watch sport. Our order was also messed up."}
{"text":"Interesting that this place can manage to serve officially the most tasteLESS food! Forget the fish, Flavor or Freshness, I really couldn't tell if they were potato chips or some edible crispy bonded paper... 
All stars are just because, one needs a special talent to pulls this off!!! 
It's amazing as how tasteLESS flavorless simple food can be.. I still am baffled!! 
There are signs here that their crew appears on-off on wing-cooking.. are they sure the show is not \"worst cooks..\" ;) 
whatta job guys.. all said service is courteous and decent wait time!!"}
{"text":"\"The Lunch Buffet\"-  what a sad excuse for a buffet......I understand you dropped the price a buck but the sad excuse for a buffet doesn't even have WINGS on it.  The pierogies and boneless wings don't cut it.  And a HOT DOG ROLLER....what am i between 9 on the golf course or at 7-11?I know this place has changed ownership etc....but wings are what you've always been known for.  Be true to the public if you are heading in another direction.  Manager touched my table and service was attentive and friendly (only reasons for any stars).  I've grown up here my whole life and frequented this establishment often bit i'm hard pressed to say i will be back.  It's a shame because my kids love the nostalgia as well as the food but the consistent decrease in quality will not have me back."}
{"text":"Small, overcooked boneless wings that looked more like chicken mcnuggets (though the sauce was tasty enough). Pretty decent philly steak sandwich. Overpriced kids' meals with very small portions. Inattentive service (had to ask for more ranch, then for more ketchup, then for the check). This was our first visit, and it will also be our last."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why the reviews are so low for this place! I'm personally a fan of this place after dining here just once. I went for their trivia session on Monday night and it was a blast!

Their chicken wings are just as good (if not better) as Buffalo Wild Wings' wings. I tried the Arizona Ranch and the Medium wings and they were both pretty delicious. A small order comes with ~10 wings or so ($.99 upcharge for getting two flavors was kind of a bummer) but the wings are pretty large, so that was more than enough to fill me. The service was considerably slower, but I was warned about this due to it being trivia night.

They also have an AYCE wing special on Tuesday evenings I believe! I've heard that that's pretty delicious and definitely a good deal if you can eat a lot.

The actual restaurant is a pretty cool establishment! I heard that it's called Quaker Steak & Lube because people used to get their car serviced here while eating a meal, hence the Steak & Lube part. It's quite a bit larger than I expected from a restaurant like this, and I really liked the neon green lights all over the building. It's a pretty hard place to miss if you're passing by at night.

I will note that the waiter never refilled any of my party's water throughout the whole night. This is probably cause of trivia, but still...it was kind of annoying to continuously ask the bar for more water."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is clever, how they turned a body shop into a diner/restaurant.
The wedge salad dressing, avocado with lime something was nasty. The burgers were good, not thee best but good. I probably won't go again because I'm not from Ohio, just visiting. If I were to come back I don't think I'd come back either there was nothing to make it stand out."}
{"text":"Well, the Quaker Steak locations are pretty cool. Very Alpha. The sauce flavors are pretty enticing also, my favorite is Louisiana Licker, a spicy Cajun concoction. My only complaint is : Where do they get wings that small? They are like half the size of wings anywhere else. It really only makes sense to go there on \"Wing Night\" when it's \"AYCE\". O and if I wanted beer in a plastic cup, I'd go to a kegger. For as much as beer costs there, I want glass."}
{"text":"Good restaurant if you are into bikes and badasses. They can be creeps though. I like the food here. Wings are good, not great. But the environment is an experience. All other food is basically what you would normally expect."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once, but I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar for the OSU game. It wasn't busy, which surprised me but  I didn't mind because we got good seats and didn't have to deal with a large crowd. The bartenders there were very nice and friendly--the guy bartender (Rich) would make conversation with us a couple different times which annoyed my boyfriend, but I didn't mind. To me it just showed he wanted to engage with his customers and have a good time. We got the nachos for an app, which I think were a little overpriced for how much we got but they were very good. The tall draft beers we ordered were only $5. I got some boneless wings that were good, although I got mild sauce and there was no kick to it at all. My boyfriend got one of those big buckets of wings, and he made a comment about how the wings used to be very small but now they are a good size. I would def. go back here if I just want a chill afternoon/night, especially if I want to watch a game."}
{"text":"I would normally give this restaurant 4-stars but the service that me and my friend reviewed was not the greatest. She was just chit chatting for about 10 minutes with a coworker while we were waiting for our checks. The wings were very good though."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great wings, and fun atmosphere!  Always get great service regardless how busy it is.  One of our favorite burger stops!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my lunch buffet, the first time I had dined at Quaker Steak in years.

I enjoyed excellent and pleasant service from server Cara and the blonde hostess.  They presented a friendly and welcoming image of the restaurant.

What is offered at the buffet for the reasonable price of $8.99 is impressive.  The salad bar contains many good and fresh choices, and the delicious chicken salad and cole slaw were not overly creamy as some restaurant's such offerings are. There were also fresh chicken strips. I do not care for seafood, but seafood salad was presented as well. There were three tempting, cold sandwich and wrap choices. There is a soup bar, which contained hearty tomato bisque and chicken soup.  There is a revolving grill with what was kolbassi or sausage.  The hot foods included salisbury steak and beef stroganoff, wings, deliciously seasoned fresh green beans, spaghetti, corn, homemade chips, and onion straws. There were delicious french fries, which I enjoyed covered in mushroom gravy from the stroganoff dish. I did not partake of them, but there were several tempting desserts, including chocolate brownies.

The restaurant is attractive, spacious, and comfortable.

I enjoyed a delicious and reasonably priced lunch extravaganza!  Bravo, Quaker Steak!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here once after running an errand in Valley View and sat out on the patio for a beer / wings.  I was really comfortable, other then the 20 mph wind gusts, just sitting here stuffing my face with spicy garlic wings and Bud Light.  The wings were really good, done exactly how I like, not overcooked and dry., but enough sauce to make me sweat  The place was packed and after talking to the bartender, its always that way.  She wanted me to stick around for 'Bike Night' but that was something that didn't sound like fun at the time.  My luck I'd tip one over and get my ass handed to me.

Overall its a typical QSL joint.  Loved by most and satisfies the wing and beer craving just fine.  I prefer Quaker over BW3's any day but maybe not as much as a local dive bar with good wings.  There is such a thing as being TOO busy."}
{"text":"This location was a zoo when it first opened and that was, unfortunately, the time I went.  Now I've been back a couple times post grand opening and each time seemed just as busy.  Good for business, but bad for a guy that just wants to go in, eat, and be out without wasting the whole day. 

Now as a wing connoisseur of some sort, I think that they are good but not great.  Slightly overpriced in my eyes.  Especially when most bars and restaurants are currently in a wing war, running 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 cent wings, QSL is sticking to their Tuesdays AYCE day.  Maybe with a little investigating and boredom, I'll compile a list of bars and restaurants running specials on wings on the east side.

Service is as good as expected when they are constantly busy, the decor is really cool, I really like the layout, but, again, the wings are OK.  I like my wings saucy (puddle of sauce on the bottom of the basket in case you need a little more kick), crisp skin with a moist, meaty inside, and trimmed of any unrecognizable chucks of who knows what.  I really hate when places bring out wings with small feathers still attached too.   Best wings I have ever had are at The Anchor in Buffalo.  Best Wings on the east side.....well you'll have to wait for that list.

Overall, go to QSL for the wings and wings only, that's what they specialize in and the sauce selection is remarkable.  Great place to bring kids, watch sports, and drink beer.  But just keep in mind that there are better wings in town.

Sauce suggestion: Golden Garlic"}
{"text":"The place has good wings, but only if you order them at the restaurant, they are far worse when you order takeout (I've ordered in both at the location and takeout more than once, so I feel this is consistent). All of the rest of the food is very average."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple QSL locations in various places. The food is always good. No complaints there. They do have excellent wings both bone-in and boneless. Sauces are many and are very good. 

This location, we've had pretty poor service both times we've been here - empty drinks are a problem when you are eating spicy things after all. Also, I don't appreciate having to wait 25 minutes to order my food because the server is trying to settle up with a group across the way. That's not my problem and it would take 1 minute to come over and take our order while you wait for them to get their credit cards out. 

Even the below-average service I would be more likely to endure if the value were better. In my opinion, although the wings are quite good, the Lizard's are just as good and much cheaper especially on their wing night. $40 bucks for two baskets of 15 wings each and one Pepsi - that's a little crazy. 

Food is good, atmosphere is cool, but go to the Lizard for cheaper, just-as-good wings."}
{"text":"Very good choice for a laid back dinner with friends. A little on the pricier side, but the food is extremely good for the price. I got the boneless wing salad, it was huge and very filling. Our server was friendly, we had empty drink cups only once, but another server (maybe a manager) came over and refilled them for us, I thought that was very nice. Only complaint is there isn't much else to do in the area besides the movies, it would be nice if they had more locations by a mall or a shopping center."}
{"text":"This place really should get 5 stars for being spectacularly awful. It really is tough to get this bad. I'm not even joking. Given that this location is based in an airport, one would think that the service would be somewhat efficient. Oh no, not at this QS&L. It took almost 20 minutes for the bartender to ask for the order, then my food got there almost an hour later after I reminded them about it. It would be one thing if the bar was packed but I was one of TWO people at the bar. The servers and bartender at this location just had such a busy social life that all they were doing was talking to each other rather than serving food. It really must feel like Cheers for the people who work there given the riveting social life they have at work. Not so much for customers with planes to catch.

By the time my food came, my flight was almost boarding but after such anticipation, I had to try the food and boy was this par for the course. The \"hot\" wings came with barely any sauce and the little sauce it came with was of the wrong flavor. I asked for hot and I received the wrong order (though given the abysmal level of service, I had already braced myself for this)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fairly decent. I don't really like the style of menu as they are very distracting. The only one thing I really enjoy the visit is that they are serving Debonne \"Rat Cellar\" beer at this location. I am not crazy about their wings. It's not my favorite."}
{"text":"Always can expect the same thing. It is nice being consistent. A little known fact about this place is that their burgers are excellent! I also love the pretzels. Ask for a side of golden garlic sauce to dip them in. Only way I will eat them!"}
{"text":"The wings are fantastic! The best wing sauces I tried ever! The service at the bar is great and very friendly and they have
Some good drink specials during the week! I come here very often!"}
{"text":"Always a good time love outdoor patio really nice clean and not too $$$$....what more do u need.....yum"}
{"text":"This place had great food with excellent service. The wings were cooked to perfection and the golden garlic sauce was awesome. To top it off our server Ebby was the best. While taking care of many tables he have us great a service."}
{"text":"Every once in a while we like to get some wings. Usually they are of the Fahrenheit variety (is there a James Beard award for wings? OK, probably not, but if there were Rocco wins it hands down) but, alas, Tremont wasn't in our plans. We saw Skyfall at Cinemark in Valey View and decided to stop at Quaker Steak and Lube which is a 30 second drive from the theater. 

Sat in the bar and watched as two brave souls ordered the Triple Atomic Wings (better known as the \"I want my mommy\" flavor) and while each finished their six, one guy drank two large glasses of milk after and the other (permanently, I think) affixed his lips to a the side of a full glass of beer. I have zero idea how anyone eats those.  I couldn't do it on a bet. 

We decided to keep it considerably more easy-going and ordered the bbq and the dusted chipotle bbq flavors plus a side of onion rings. Yeah, healthy as hell, I know, but sometimes you just have to, period.  And, tonight we had to and were glad we did. We both enjoyed the wings a great deal and the rings as well truly hit the spot. 

We're not big franchise food lovers but I must say the few times we've been to this QS&L we've been pleasantly surprised.  Whenever we need a wing fix we head here and will continue to do so.  Many props to Luke M for his review as it got me thinking about coming here."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Q. Love the wings and onion rings plus they always seem to have decent specials. 

If you're a bar food aficionado, Quaker Steak is your place."}
{"text":"Quaker Steak is honestly one of the more mediocre dining options on Kent State's campus. I've eaten here multiple times, but every experience I've had has been underwhelming. 

The line is usually pretty long when you walk in, which I didn't mind usually because there used to be menus placed along the line, so I would just take my time and pick out my food. There are no longer paper menus though, and instead everything is on a digital screen that changes too quickly for me to really read thoroughly. Quaker was also out of their cookie dessert, which was disappointing because that's the main reason I ate there in the first place. When I attempted to fill up my drink, Quaker was also out of literally every single type of soft drink, so I wasted my money paying for water. I could also tell that my food had been sitting out for a while when my waitress finally brought it to my table because it was luke warm. 

If you're not bothered by ridiculously slow service, few food options and overpriced / mediocre food, then Quaker is the on-campus option for you. If not, I would stick to the hub."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some wings then this may be the place for you. I wasn't and neither were my toddler children. Their Kraft mac n cheese and my chicken mac n cheese were both sub par despite the recommendation of our server. We waited 15 minutes for the bill after we finished eating."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the wings here and the onion ring tower was delicious and intimidating.  The waitress had a good beer suggestion which I have since forgotten but I will be returning the next time I'm back in Madison to rediscover that long lost ale."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer: It was the 4th of July at lunch when we went so you can bet the \"B\" team or maybe even \"Skeleton C\" was working to begin with so I'll start there. I ordered an appetizer and main course for my kids and I. The appetizer and the kids food came out, no issues so no problems there. I ordered wings. My order didn't come out with the kids and after about five minutes, the waitress came over with a puzzled look on her face and asked where my lunch was. I told her it hadn't come out yet so she went to check. After a minute or so, the hostess peeks her head out from behind the kitchen and looks puzzled as well. So another five minutes or so goes by and finally my wings come out. They are over cooked (which is better than undercooked I guess) and a mix of wings and drums. I ordered drums only. I also ordered bleu cheese and celery, only got the bleu cheese. No extra napkins, no wipes at the end of the meal. Like I said, I'm going to chalk this up to a skeleton crew but it was just an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Julie was our server.  Very unfriendly.  Uninterested and grumpy.   Hardly checked on us. And when she did she didn't ask if we wanted anything else, just left the check and walked off. Had a permanent scowl on her face.  Spoke to multiple friends who said they also had her and will never return.   Very disappointed.  Won't be coming back. She's like a black hole sucking the kindness from you.  Wasn't a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"So the loaded nachos are not loaded. There are so many chips very little meat, cheese or other toppings.  There are better choices here at the airport.  Will stop at a different eatery next trip here."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet many times before use to be very good but now it no longer has wings on it. 10$ and no wings very disappointed probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Our visit was on a Friday night after previously being impressed by another Quaker steak location we decided since we were in the area to try out this location. We patiently waited about 35 minutes for a table (which is fine, I get it's a busy time). We got to our table, ordered drinks, appetizers, and our meals. We are a party of 5 and about 10 minutes after ordering a girl came out with my dinner... and only my dinner. I asked why my dinner was coming by itself with the other 4 dinners missing and we hadn't gotten appetizers yet. She returned to the kitchen with my dinner. Our appetizers came and the food was pretty good. A few minutes later they served all of our meals. Of the 5 meals that we ordered, 2 were edible. Mine was quite clearly the same meal they had brought out and tried to serve me 15 minutes earlier and was ice cold. My stepdads steak (that he ordered medium rare) was so well done it was almost burnt. The kids meal was strange in that it offers almost none of the specialties that people come to Quaker steak for, no wings. Chicken tenders. Other than that grilled cheese and spaghetti. What?? Anyway even with the steak being removed from our bill, it was still over $100 for two children and 2 adults. The only plus side to this meal is that our server was spectacular. She never let my drink get empty and was on top of every request that was asked of her. She is the only reason that there are 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Mahi Street tacos were ok. The wings were ok as well but underwhelming with some of the hype below. Maybe I picked an odd flavor combo. Atmosphere kind of cool. Has several sports games on. Was family friendly."}
{"text":"Spot on wings here! If you're at United gate within the Pittsburgh airport then stop by. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Boneless wings and regular wings were good they are keeping me from a single star. Macaroni and cheese was pretty bad. Disqustingly saltly my brother in law could barely eat it with wing rub sprinkled all over it. They got rid of wing night at this location too. No wonder it was dead in there. Service was below average as well. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great wings!!!!!!!!!!! I love this place great people great food. bike night was great. Was here in  July 2011"}
{"text":"There isn't too much of a selection at CLE so this place has been my go to dinner + drink before my weekly trek to B2. 

Wings are pretty good but I think I'll just stick with the standard hot / atomic wings. The others are just straight out of the bottle and smothered on the wings. 

Fries are nice and crispy. Not at all healthy for you though. Good luck trying to hold it all in on the plane. 

Staff is pretty friendly but remember they do close early so be prepared to wolf down some chicken and beer. The show is over when they turn off the tvs. 

Move on down to the Pub if you want to continue the party."}
{"text":"A shell of what it used to be.

Growing up in Venango county I am familiar with the original in Sharon, PA.  Quaker Steak has to be on the Mount Rushmore of wing bars and because of that they're relying on that 20 years later.

Service so slow it has to be on purpose to make you order more drinks.  Wings that have shrunk so much over the years it's laughable, and inflated prices make me sick to think of what it used to be.

What a shame because the Buckeye Barbecue and Louisiana Licker sauces are so good.  

QSL has let the fame go to their heads.  Go to a real local joint or buy the sauces at Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"The wings were so hard, over fried and burnt, that it was the first time ever I actually decided not to finish a meal when I was starving.  There was barely any sauce with the wings. These were probably the worst wings I ever ate. The server was great."}
{"text":"Normally I love the lube.  But this past visit missed the mark.   I had the tex mex burger and ordered it medium well.  It was well done and dry.    Also had had a jar drink for 8 bucks which tasted like plain old lemonade.  To their credit the took it off the bill.  The burger was beautiful to look at. Worthy of a photo but over cooked. It also took an abnormal amount of time to receive our order, even though it was not busy.    I'm thinking of dining elsewhere on our next dinner visit to Mentor."}
{"text":"Kinda like a TGIFs or a Applebees. I was drunk when I got here. I continued drinking while here. I can barely remember what I had. I can say a couple friends and I asked for a soufflé cup of their hottest atomic wing sauce. the one you have to sign a release for.. we weren't brave enough to try a whole order of wings with it but we dipped chips in it etc.. so, I will say this place is very cool and accommodating when asking for stuff like that. check it out. its worth a look. better than McDonalds or wherever  else you may stop"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the quality of the wings, and I'm comparing these guys to BW3. More work to find the meat than the meal was worth. Good beer selection"}
{"text":"I must say, the next couple of times we have been there, the service has been improved...hopefully it keeps moving in that direction!"}
{"text":"Slow service even though there's very few people here. Food took forever to get to our table and was cold when it arrived. Kinda disappointed :("}
{"text":"Save your money and stay away!!! Bland mediocre food and horrible service. Lettuce in my salad was rotten, potato chips were bland and greasy. Wings were just OK. Server said they didn't have honey mustard sauce, what????? It says so on the menu! Then she went and looked for it and brought it to us. Nachos were horrible, basically nacho chips with 1 oz. of cheese, 3 beans and 1 oz. of ground beef. What is the allure? Oh yeah, kitchy car motif. Take my advice, take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Based on my one visit while flying back home from PIT. Place looked good and I was in the mood for some wings. Server was friendly and took order quick. Had the boneless in Thai and Louisiana BBQ flavored. Wings were juicy white meat and the flavors were both tasty. Had onion rings as a side, big and good breading. 4 or 5 tvs for sports, decent price for airport."}
{"text":"My experience at the QS&L in Bloomsberg was far more dramatic than this outing in Robinson, a suburb chained by...chains!

Kay loves chain restaurants, so here we came Friday night. 

I almost ordered the Triple Atomic Wings again, but the week had been eventful enough, and I had nothing left to prove. Although, after we finished our meal, Teresa, our wonderful server, mentioned that I would have gotten a t-shirt out of it.

In Bloomsberg I got a decal. 

Teresa thought that was lame also. 

Not so lame was the BBQ O-Ring Cheesesteak, which contains chipped sirloin, onion rings, bacon, a cheddar/jack cheese blend, and their signature \"Original\" BBQ sauce all in a bun made for grinders. Sugary, meaty, gooey, and messy, it's the kind of thing that goes down fairly well past midnight with a beer, or in my teatotalling case, a long, tall Pepsi. 

One reviewer called the homemade potato chips \"bland and greasy.\" On my end they were perfectly crunchy and salted. *shrugs shoulders* 

Being a responsible investigator on Yelp, I skipped the Triple Rich Fudge Brownie (I've already had it) and went for the Caramel Apple Nachos for dessert. For my trouble, I got a wide plate full of freshly fried, sugar-n-cinnamon-coated tortilla chips that were garnished with apple pie-filling and caramel, all of which revolved around a lone scoop of vanilla ice cream.A twist on the fried ice cream phenomenon, I rather enjoyed the wacky chain restaurant creation for what it was; a wacky chain restaurant creation. 

And QS&L is the waking definition of \"wacky.\" Vehicles hang over your heads. Kids dine alongside orange-complected, suburban, 20 something females who sing loudly, drunkenly, flirtatiously...desperately along to every female-sung track that plays on the jukebox.

Car antennae hold onion rings. 

I know it's a chain, but I liked everything I had. Run me over, now. 

But before you step on the gas, keep in mind that I LIKED it. I didn't love it. Ok?"}
{"text":"This location never fails to let me down. I keep giving it a chance because it's convenient and I love Quakers at other locations. Last night we ordered a pick up order and calling it in was the first headache. The girl who took our order answered the phone unprofessionally, laughing at something then took 8 minutes to take our order. We pick up our food (our expensive, over priced food) and got home (15 min drive) to find they forgot an entire meal! My ribs we're dried up and disgusting also. The manager gave us a coupon, which is nice but I hope it can be used at different locations, as I've had the same terrible experiences at this location several times. How hard is it to be professional, remember to put a meal in a bag and to offer a non dried out, burnt item on your menu? Never going back."}
{"text":"Came for the wings.  Ordered hot and they were not hot but they were OK.  Typical average wings you can get many places.  Service was good."}
{"text":"It's a little like Buffalo Wild Wings, but it's not national....yet. They serve the best wings I've ever had at a chain restaurant, and they play all the games! You get a Twizzler with your check. Cool."}
{"text":"Summary:
What quaker Steak lacks in class, consistency, quality, and value it more than makes up for in gluttony.  

The Big Deal:
All you can eat wings for around 13 dollars is a weekly ritual that I only somewhat begrudgingly keep up Tuesday nights.  The format is you get 4 wings at a time which surprisingly come out not at the snails pace of a normal all-you-can-eat game but at a decent pace.  Long Islands are 3$ and service is pretty quickl

My favorite:
Get supercharged wings.  They are absolutely delicious, even if after 4 I wind up crying they are still so tasty.  For the more faint of heart you gotta try Haute Parm.

Shortfalls:
Sometimes they serve you wings that are too dry or are overcooked but the next four are usually better.  The Long islands aren't as strong as good ones, but hey, it's not like the Lube is a Gay Bar (which by the way is the least apparaently true statement I've ever made). The huge hordes of high school jocks hitting on the food runners only heat the blood without boiling it.  I love hate this place.

The Secret:
They also deliver, and when you order a big bucket of wings they have yet to totally miss the mark for me."}
{"text":"The food itself is really really good, but the two times I've been here the service has been shady at best, but you can't beat the food when u r waiting for a delayed flight"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Wings and fried pickles are my favorites.  The pickles are spears which is a rare take on the app.  The only issue is that the place has an odd smell, I think it has to do with the carpet.  It needs to be steamed clean or replaced with wood floors.  Hopefully someone will read this and take note.  I am a big fan of Quaker Steak and Lube and will go regardless, but it may turn others off."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some wings - lots of variations to pick from.  I was trying to \"behave\" with my order, so I ordered the grilled boneless wings with steamed broccoli.  I got them with a medium buffalo-style sauce - not my go-to flavor, but it was very good.  The meal was satisfying and relatively healthy (it CAN be done!).

I've had other wing-based offerings before, and I would say they have a great variety of sauces to choose from.  If you can't find a sauce you like, you're probably better off getting a burger (which isn't bad here if you need to do it)."}
{"text":"if i could give no stars i would, i love the quaker steak in vermilion i always have the best experience. we decided to go to this location which is a little closer to home, and had the worst service ever. our server, Cora was inattentive and forgot to put our appetizers in so we ended up getting our second course way before our appetizers ever came out. Our server never apologized or asked how anything was the entire time we were there. wish i could of found the manager but no one was ever around."}
{"text":"I think \"hmmmmm\" is the best way I can describe this place. Who really reviews a chain though, right? You can't expect much --- I left with a bad taste in my mouth so I am doing my due diligence. 

Service was just a bit off , food was cold (literally cold & cold wings are gross) and our fry appetizer came out after the wings. He explained he accidentally hit \"to go\" instead \"as app\" -- no problem, right? Well, they should have dumped the fries on a plate and re-topped them rather than giving us dumped out of a box fries with toppings awry.  The one gentleman was very nice behind the bar and checked on us a few times -- when he was not behind the bar the other gentleman did not seem to pay attention to anything. He ran my card for the wrong tab and after attempting to flag him down I had to wait for the other bartender to come back behind the bar to run my card for the accurate (more expensive) amount. The man who made the error did not apologize or blink an eye -- he just complained about these two very strange regulars that come into the bar. 

It is not on my list of places to return to."}
{"text":"I got the boneless wings which were obviously frozen.  Freaking Terrible!"}
{"text":"If you are a car or motorcycle nut you would probably up this a star just for the ambience.  There were many motorcycles perched above the tables, hanging from the ceiling.  A little boy in the next booth asked his dad 'if one of the motorcycles fell - would we get hurt?'  I think the answer was - yes, but hopefully no one would be under them.  Well that started me thinking and I, of course, had to check out how they were mounted.  Looked pretty darn secure to me so now it was time to relax and play some buzztime NTN trivia and have a couple drinks and some appies.  

Our waitress said they are known for their wings and so we tried several different sauces with the boneless chicken breast tenderloins - very healthy - well, except for a sodium overload.  We also ordered some shrimp tacos which had three pretty good size deep fried shrimp along the usual accompaniments.  Quite tasty.  

I would go back if I were in the neighborhood for some fake healthy chicken wings and trivia."}
{"text":"Not the best place to get wings in the area, but definitely worth it when you come on a Tuesday for the all you can eat wings. 

Being me, and having an obsession with anything having to do with pickles, I always have to go for the Pick Up Pickles. They are pretty much just fried pickles with your choice of ranch or some spicy kind of ranch for your dipping sauce.

The wings are good, nothing special, but good. The sauces are really what makes the wings though. I tend to be partial to the Haute Parm, but tend to also like to get something with garlic in the sauce (usually golden garlic). I tend to be a feen for anything spicy, but for some reason i've only made it as far as the dusted ghost pepper (which was pretty damn hot).

They really don't have anything special when it comes to drinks, but I really wasn't expecting much from a wing place anyway.

Never had a problem with the staff, they tend to be attentive and always willing to help. 

I recommend stopping here if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Visited with my family:  wife, 7th grade daughter, 9th grade son. Everyone gave it a \"three\" except my daughter, who gave it a four. Daughter got chicken quesadilla, a little small but it was on appetizer menu so fine overall. She enjoyed it. Son got shrimp basket. He eats everything, but pulled the breading off the shrimp and set it aside because it was too salty for him. Wife got a burger and fries, which were good but pretty standard for these types of restaurants. She also said everything tasted \"salty\" but neither she nor my son added salt to anything. My wife also got a half-price margarita, but said it tasted like sweet lemonade with no discernable alcohol. I got a Great Lakes draught, can't go wrong with that.

I judge restaurants like this based on their sandwiches. I love sandwiches, but get really annoyed when you're paying 12+ dollars for a sandwich and it's half bread. My traditional steak sandwich (kind of like a cheesesteak) was half bread, had no visible sautéed onions, and had two tiny bits of sautéed red pepper. Skimpy on meat and mushrooms too, and was way salty (a common theme with our meal overall). This happens too often when dining out:  a picture of a mega-stuffed sandwich on the menu and a skimpy-ass half-stuffed bun when they bring it out. To their credit, I was brought a side of sautéed veggies after complaining but it's not hard to make a darn sandwich properly. I swear it's like the kitchen staff gets a bonus for all the sandwich fillings left unused at the end of the night. My onion rings, on the other hand, were very good. I would get them again.

That being said, the atmosphere was fun and our wait staff was excellent. Would recommend based on atmosphere (lots of families there) and wait staff, but not for most of the overly-salted food we tried. That plus the $65 tab means we're glad we checked it out but probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Looks like this location closed for good as well. Seems lots of these are going under. Admittedly it was a bit of a dive unlike other locations. So maybe they have been hemorrhaging money for some time. Still did the Triple Atomic and lived"}
{"text":"My brother, his expecting wife, their 2 children, my son & I all went out for a nice family dinner this evening, while they were visiting from across the state. 
We waited 45 min for food even though they weren't particularly busy while we were there. Then 3 out of the 7 of us received very burnt cheesesteak sandwiches!! It was only the bottoms of all our sandwiches, so we began eating & checked and didn't see burns (only checked tops). We noticed it tasted terrible!!    We didn't eat much because it tasted awful, we had to leave so we couldn't ask for replacements, nor did they offer!! 
When I got home, I was going to feed it to my dog, when I turned it over to peel it from the bread.....and it was burnt til it was like charcoal in spots!! Needless to say... I wouldn't feed it to my dog, and I sure as heck didn't! (Wasn't gonna clean up that afternath!)  see pic of MY actual sandwich I received! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Today, the I took the fam to see a 3D movie and then we headed across the parking lot to Quaker Steak & Lube.  We were in the mood for wings and this is the right place to go for wings.

I ordered the Buckeye Barbecue, my wife ordered Louisiana Lickers, and my daughter ordered the kids BBQ.  All three flavors were really good.  I loved my Buckeye BBQ wings even if they were a tad spicy for my taste.  My wife's Louisiana Lickers had a delicious, intricate flavor and were about 1/4 as hot as the 5000 Scoville Unit Buckeye BBQ wings.  Boy were they good!

The decor of this place is outstanding, with full sized race cars and motor cycles hanging on the walls and ceiling!"}
{"text":"Never expected such wonderful wings from this place. Absolutely loved my golden garlic wings. Drowned it with chilled beer. Samuel Adams + golden garlic wings = heaven"}
{"text":"About what you'd expect at an airport sit-down casual dining spot. I had a plain old salad with chicken which was 'fine' and a scotch which was a nice pour. Service was friendly and location was relatively clean. I probably wouldn't go back, but then again, there aren't that many great spots at the airport to begin with. Best to eat before getting to the airport, if you have that luxury."}
{"text":"The wings here are good with a lot of choices of sauce. The staff, especially the bar tenders are more interested in talking about which shifts they hate and how much they don't want to be working than they are in pouring drinks and talking to customers. Kinda sad since this has been better in the past."}
{"text":"I like this place overall. The service is good, so is the food.  The prices aren't bad. I just wish they had a better desert menu."}
{"text":"Always pass by these establishments whenever I'm
Outside of Michigan and in the Midwest. I also know while they do have steak in the name, they are known for their wings and hey I love wings, so why not try. Came in this place and it was about a hour wait for a table but luckily the bar was open immediately. They have a really nice size menu with options for all. For my meal I shared the loaded magna fries (was big enough to share and the fries was really good, only complaint is that it wasn't enough cheese) and of course I had wings. Here is how I would rank them based on the sauces I had (5 types): golden garlic (best type and great sauce), buckeye BBQ (perfect mix of sweet and spice), Thai r cracker (pretty good, same class as your Asian zings and sauces of those nature), Parmesan pepper (taste how it sounds), haute parm (wasn't bad just didn't stack up to the other sauces). Overall this place is great. Based on the emphasis on wings here, this place is in the Buffalo Wild Wings, hooters, wing stop class as far as corporate wings places but they are so much better (bigger menu, more wing sauces, they serve beer in 100 oz tubes, interesting decor/building, better food, etc). I think Quaker steak and lube need to go ahead and bring that business to Michigan because they do have a"}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience ever, we have been waiting for 45 minutes to get our food, took 15-20 minutes to even get talked to, I understand it's busy because of the game, but this is ridiculous, all of the managers were basically talking to each other the whole entire time, even went in the cooler to do god knows what, we were told that we would get 10% off for the inconvenience but honestly that doesn't suffice for how bad our service was tonight, some days service is really good, but some days it's just really crappy"}
{"text":"Stopped in today on a whim. The hostess asked if we needed children's menus and I asked what the age limit was. She stated she wasn't sure but she thought ten years of age. Ok... No thank you. We sit down, and realize there is a \"tween\" menu for ages 9-12 I believe. Perfect. So my 12 year old orders the double cheeseburger w a side of Mac n cheese. The waitress says no, the Mac n cheese is it's own meal, not a side dish. So I read the description and it says double cheeseburger and may pick a side. I would like the Mac n cheese as a SIDE. I realize there is a double order of Mac n cheese as a meal but she does not want Mac n cheese w a side of Mac n cheese. We all get our meals and the waitress brings out for my daughter two bowls of Mac n cheese. I explain to her again she asked for a double cheeseburger w side of Mac n cheese. To her credit she was very pleasant. By this time I have given my daughter half my food to eat, and my son and I have both received several drink refills but my husband, who was drinking diet has had an empty glass for   What seems like forever. She claims the drink she set in front of my son was diet but it was not, it was completely syrupy Pepsi. She then brought my husband a diet. Upon getting our bill we determine she has also charged 2.39 for my daughter's drink which was supposed to be .99 if ordered w a tween meal. Overall, I feel like the staff was super friendly and trying to accommodate but simply were not familiar with their menu. The booth, the menus, even the seating by the restrooms was all sticky! We usually tip very well, around 25% but left a little more than 15% and that is ONLY because the waitress was so friendly. We ordered wings, which were very good, fries were gross, philly cheese steak, amazing, and a couple diff burgers which were also very good! We would def go back but suggest they learn their menu or be able to answer a simple question."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was built. Such an awesome hangout and wing place. I move back a decade later and my how times have changed. Unfortunately, nothing here has. It seems as though everybody gave up on really cleaning things or putting forth real effort to have a great wing place. It feels more like a grimy dive bar than a chain restaurant that is known for having good wings. 

The bartender was very personable. The time of my visit (about two hours to close) things had slowed down so I got to sit and listen to servers bitch about hours, customers, and tasking while enjoying my wings. It took a crazy amount of time to get my order but the manager comped part to make up for it. That was definitely appreciated. 

This place could be good again with better staff and a good update/cleaning. I won't be back until that happens."}
{"text":"Dusted Chipolte BBQ wings were incredible.......service terrible unfortunately. One bartender and it was slammed. Felt bad for him but lacked any personality"}
{"text":"It was the night before Thanksgiving and my pantry was bare...
And I wasn't quite ready to get in my family's hair...
So I drove into Middleton to see what sounded yummy....
I stopped at Quaker Steak & Lube for something for my tummy.

I knew poultry would be eaten the very next day,
So I ordered a steak without much delay.
My server was nice, maybe over aware...
But the steak was cooked nice, Medium Rare.

I had a baked potato and salad, as my two sides.
I ordered their onion rings, they were a mighty big size.
The cold brew that I ordered was a pleasant treat
To help me wash down that nice piece of meat.

The downfall was that I wanted a table, but also TVs.
I was surrounded by tables full of families.
I would have been better served in the bar.
I will remember that the next time this spot is on my radar."}
{"text":"Certainly a visual feast for any auto enthusiast on the walls, ceilings, etc. An Indy race car is suspended from the ceiling, a 1970's era Mercury muscle car & a Chevy Corvette are perched above the seating area.  Lots of license plates, NASCAR hoods, and even the side of the #18 M&M's Sprint cup car.

I ordered the steak & magna fries.  I liked their choice of spices for the steak, and the magna fries (melted cheese & bacon) were an ample serving.  Order was brought to the table in a timely manner.

I have one thing that bothered me though.  The wait staff was generally overweight, unkempt hair, and not the type of persons I would expect to see in a chain restaurant.  The female that brought the meal to my table had facial piercings and an armful of tattoos.  This probably would not have concerned me as much had I gone to the Harley-themed bar across the highway, but I simply didn't think they were projecting a good impression of this business."}
{"text":"Our family has made it a tradition to come here after their racing experiences (mainly for their lube tube of beer...100 oz of blue moon for $26), but their food was pretty decent.  I ordered the Arizona el camino burger medium well done and wo the tortilla strips.  It was super loaded with pepper jack cheese bacon sour cream corn and black beans.  You can get more than just french fries including broccoli or mac and cheese or even a baked potato.  Toddlers get free snack packs of goldfish crackers which was a big plus.  Around $10 per entree.  It was a decent restaurant but the server, De, was pretty darn helpful!"}
{"text":"Decided to give the ol' Lube a trip last Friday for 2 reasons. The first restaurant we wanted to go to had a 45 minute wait and because my lady friend has never been to Quaker Steak before (she is always down for wings, I'm lucky to have found such a great woman). We don't venture out this far west too often but we were in Avon so I suggested going there because I haven't been in a while. I normally go to the Lakewood QS and was relieved to see that this location in Sheffield was much larger.
 
We were seated immediately in a very large (enough for 8 people) booth and the charm of old school cars and gas tanks was right in our face. Props to the hostess for sitting me right in front of the biggest TV in the place, so I could check on the Tribe. We came here because we wanted to eat some FRIED food.
 
The full order of onion rings come strategically stacked on a car's antenna. The crunchiness of the breading made for a great and filling appetizer for the both of us. Wasn't much of a fan of the Louisiana Licker sauce it comes with though, I'd get ranch next time. We also got a \"compact\" bucket of Golden Garlic wings (my choice) and the medium wings (her choice). I appreciate that QS gives you a full and meaty wing unlike other chain establishments (cough cough BWW). The golden garlic had great flavor and to be honest I wish the whole bucket of about 20 wings came in this sauce. The medium wings weren't bad but I would rather try something different next time.
 
Overall, this is a good wing chain. I wouldn't give the place any crazy awards or anything but you get a good meal for a reasonable price. Our food came fast and big ups to our wonderful server Erin. It was also cool to see that the kid next to us who was having a birthday get a special song and free dessert from the whole serving staff. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Great el camino burger. Split that and an order of garlic wings with my girlfriend and still had leftovers to take home. We also had onion rings that came out nice and hot with some good sauce for dipping. Add a couple raspberry ices teas and our bill came out to $43. No bad."}
{"text":"Stopped by after riding the cuyahoga valley national railroad. They weren't to busy, plenty if parking, got seated right away. We ended up getting the buffet.....what a mistake. Hamburgers were disgusting and dried out, hot dogs weren't any better. The salad bar was ok. The wings were all right. If I go again, I will stick to ordering from the menu."}
{"text":"$7.99 for a \"pound\" (6) of regular wings? WTF?? Could six wings even weigh a pound BEFORE cooking?? Took 45 minutes to get the food we ordered and the place wasn't that busy on a Thursday evening. Small portions and fish was over-cooked. Drink was served in small plastic cup. Overall bad experience. Server was friendly and apologetic, and he did take 20% off of the order without us having to ask, but won't be going back to any QS&L. NOTE: Wednesday is \"BIKE NIGHT\", so if you like the loud, obnoxious sound of motorcycles while you eat or drink, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"If you want REAL eggs this is the place to go.  As I sat waiting for my meal I knew I picked the right place as a watched atleast a dozen airport employees come in and out ordering breakfast for both sit down and to go.  What was most interesting was that some of them were from airlines not even in that terminal. They had come to this place passing numerous other places for breakfast along their route.  After a great breakfast, I understand why the 'locals' go out of their way to come here."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place.  Great to relax watch the game, and cool off when it's 100 out.  Try the tower of onion rings."}
{"text":"For wings, this place is okay. We ate here last Saturday, ordered a bucket of boneless wings to share and a few sides: the fries and then chips with beer cheese dip. The wings were good, and I liked the beer cheese dip. We probably could have skipped the chips and just had it with the fries.

Service was okay, not great. I'm turned off by messy places, especially when there are crumbs on a booth seat or food on the carpeted floor in the dining area. The location is kind of a haul from the east side, but we were looking for something casual and not interested in the other wing chain on this particular night.

Next time, I think I'd prefer to just order in advance and pick up at the to-go window. No real need to sit in the restaurant when we knew what we were ordering and it's more of to-go food anyhow."}
{"text":"I have been drooling for some good wings and BW3 just doesn't do it for me anymore. I've heard legends about the wings at Quaker Steak and after a long wing drought was ready to go in for the meal.

The decor is a hoot. Race and car paraphenalia festoon the walls and just about every square inch of this place. Theme restaurant to the max. Large TVs surround the bar so this is one of the best places in Mentor to come watch a big sporting event. I was impressed with the number of beers they have on tap which is the ideal compliment to their menu packed with wings, burgers and a delicious variety of fried items (fried pickles anyone?)

Wings are the specialty of the house. They have a great heat meter with a ridiculous number of sauces...I opted for the Buckeye a very hot but sweet red sauce...loved it!"}
{"text":"I live about 5 minutes from here. My husband and I go here often for lunch. The lunch buffet is nice. They have different food, sometimes it's Italian day, or Mexican day, or ballpark day, but it's a mix of veggies, pastas, meats, and then of course the staple, wings. They used to offer a few flavors of wings, and upon request one could get whatever other flavor brought to their table in an order of 5. Now, it makes a bit more sense for speedy service. They have a tray of boneless, a tray of breaded, and a tray of unbreaded plain wings, with the full offering of sauces at the end of the table and small plastic cups. This allows one to try out many different sauces, and make their wings as saucy or as dry as they like. There is also 2 soups, usually chili and potato soup, though I've seen wedding soup and chicken soup there also. The deserts are so-so, but I'm usually so full of wings by the end of it that I don't care. The service has always been great. The food is good, not gourmet, but definitely good.

They also have an all-you-can-eat wing night on Tuesdays for $11.99. For a girl who can put away 2 dozen+ wings no problem, this is perfect! Again, the food offerings are similar to the lunch buffet. 

Honestly, I haven't ordered off the menu in years. I'm not crazy about large crowds and lots of noise so I don't usually go later in the day, hence my expertise in the lunch buffet. But if you like cars or motorcycles, sports, beer, and wings, you can't go wrong. With a variety of race cars and motorcycles suspended from the ceiling, and sports and local memorabilia on the walls, you make no mistake that you are in a sports bar. Wednesday nights during the summer are bike nights, and there's always a ton of bikes, sometimes overflowing into the Cinemark lot."}
{"text":"Day: Tuesday Time 5:30-7:30pm - I had never been to a QSL, and the idea of \"All you can eat wings\" was appealing enough to entice myself and a dining partner to try it out. I will agree that it's almost an odd thing for a franchise to be there in Lakewood, but if you think about it, there are now multiple locations for Melt, Souper Market, Menchies of course, and other things franchised, so QSL shouldn't be knocked for that fact. 

Now first of all, the \"All you can eat wings\" is actually a pretty good gig. There is a buffet with 4 wing selections - but - if you want any different kind from the menu, a 4 piece order is part of the $13.99 deal, which also includes a soft drink with refills. On the buffet is salad, soup, and lots of other things aside from wings. Little pizza bites (not that great), kielbasa links and corn dogs on a roller grill, corn nuggets, pretzel bites, meatballs, mashed potatoes and gravy, regular fries, breaded mushrooms, sausage & peppers and onion rings. So if you're able to dig all that stuff, plus donut holes and funnel fries for \"desert\", than it's a great deal. 

That said, I wasn't impressed by their wings. I don't like very spicy food items, so I can't judge there, but I had a variety anyhow of the less spicy sauces and I thought they were just eh, run of the mill. They're nothing really that I would return for, I can say that much. For flavor impact, wing-wise, I'll stick with Cleats. 

The décor as others have written, is loud and gaudy, but it's supposed to be... duh. If you're not into it, don't go. Personally, it didn't add or detract from anything, though I did like the cutout of the United States with cut-to-shape state license plates over where each state would be - that was nifty from a creative perspective, but it didn't make my visit 3-star. Pretty much, it's a sports bar. I'm tired of sports bars. I'm getting too old for them, I guess. They just seem pointless. But before I yell at you to get out of my yard, let me say this - Our service was pretty good. Tina was our server and took good care of us from point A to point B, even as it began to get busier. 

So I had good service and \"meh\" wings. Probably not going back, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend you try QSL, just to say you've tried it. 

FYI:  The AYCE buffet is Tuesdays from 5-10pm."}
{"text":"Having extremely specific diet restrictions I really appreciated the mindfulness of the staff to accommodate me. The manager read the ingredients of all sauces to see if there were any that worked, came out and let me know what had seasoning and what didn't and ultimately were able to make me a safe meal. The wait staff was friendly, the food was good (my boyfriend was able to order a more exciting menu item which he said was good), and the atmosphere was fun. Overall it was a fun and friendly place to eat that left me feeling full and thankfully not sick!"}
{"text":"Chain but favorite wing place in Madison. Good prices and nice place to to when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun place to eat. Lots of interesting there decor. The appetizer plate is a great way to try the different items from the appetizer menu. I remember the onion rings were really good. I had the ribs and they were tender and delicious."}
{"text":"I always have a great time there. The food is good, and fresh. I don't generally eat wings, but I will eat the breaded boneless ones and the sauces are good. I enjoy the Louisiana Lickers flavor, but I usually get a salad or a wrap. I come with friends and they always get the regular bone-in wings. They have specials all the time and great bar service."}
{"text":"Not too bad! The hubby likes the all-u-can-eat wings Tuesday's the most! And if your luck you get a server that puts your orders in right away so it's like a wings free for all!! Ordered the strawberry lemonade for the first time and it's suuuper sweet. I like the variety of sauces they have, especially the Thai cracker and Arizona ranch. Not a big fan of the \"dusted\" wings, crisp but seem to always be dry Magna fries appetizer was small for the price they ask. Will be back for more tho!"}
{"text":"Great variety of choices.  Known for their wings. I think their wings are better then BWWs.  They are larger and have more sauce on them  They are sold by weight instead of quantity."}
{"text":"i don't think i can say anything bad about quaker steak.. ever.

when i lived in pittsburgh, driving out to robinson town center to get wings here was an exciting little road trip, and since i was back in pittsburgh for a family function and we had to pick my brother up at the airport, i was extremely happy that it was on the way back to the city.

the boneless wings are great, the regular ones are too, i mean you can't say many bad things about buffalo wings, and with quaker steak being an east coast staple and brings back my love for the steel city, i definitely can't say anything bad about quaker steak.  so if you're ever driving around and pass one, do yourself a favor and stop in, they got wings, beers, tvs, and old motorcycles and race cars all over the place.. it's a nice little time.  enjoy."}
{"text":"Tough review.  Taste-wise, best wings I ever had.  However, hair in my wings was an unpleasant surprise.  Also, half of my wings had broken bones, which gives off a feeling of cheap/mis-handled chickens.  Service was great, beer was ice-cold.  Going with four stars even though that might be a bit high considering the mishaps."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews. I have been here dozens I mean dozens of time. I used to live by mentor and used to go here often. Now I have moved further away I still visit this place as much as I can. The atmosphere is very family friendly and it has really cool interior with cars and motorcycles hanging from the ceiling. I come here for happy hours and also their reversed late night happy hours which is half priced appetizers. I always get the lube chips and beer dip and a side of their supercharged sauce. Their beer cheese  dip is very delicious! I usually take extras to take home. The chips usually comes out hot and fresh. It is very crunchy and delicious! I have ordered many items from their menu. And they have  promotions that usually changes from steak to atomic burger to tacos. I have been a fan of their wings which is why I come here. I love their supercharged wings and also their hot garlic wings. All the other sauces are very delicious as well but i prefer my sauce to be spicy or garlicky. I also always order loaded magna fries with my wings which is  amazing. You could get a side which is perfect for one or get the whole order for 4-5 people. I have had their burgers as well and they are very good! They do have all you can eat wings on Tuesday and also specialty on their burgers on Monday! They have a calendar displaying the various specials every day of the month! The service is always good here and the bartenders are very friendly. It is a enjoyable atmosphere for great price and also great service!"}
{"text":"When we actually eat there, in the bar, everything is pretty good! Good food, good service. I like the \"Biker Chicken\" salad - delicious. However, when we order drive-thru pick-up, they forget to put all of our food items in the bag. It's happened twice now. We even repeated our order back to them, and asked if they have included everything. Last night we got home, and both Biker Chicken salads had no Chicken! We paid $11.99 each! That's $24.00 for 2 chicken salads with no chicken! My husband called to let them know their error, and they told him to \"call back later\". He left his phone number for the manager to return his call, and she never called back."}
{"text":"There was a reason why I stopped going to this restaurant in the Pointe Center near Robinson. My visit here during the Yelp event helped me remember. While you can get other foods here, their specialty is wings. 

At this passport stop on our Yelp scavenger hunt my husband and I got to sample two types of wings. One had hot sauce on it and the other regular. The wings still had the skin on them. Really wasn't impressed with either one of them. I also learned they serve breakfast here. 

Their location doesn't help much either. Located in the far end of concourse A you really won't know they were there unless you were looking for them. When I fly I normally try to skip the sit down places for breakfast anyway since I want to grab something quick just to get to my gate.

Staff was friendly and informative. Doubt I'll ever find myself here again."}
{"text":"4 Wheeler appetizers 
Comes with 5 sauces.
Staff friendly 
Not the place to stop if you only have a little time between flights"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the hate on this location.  I have been to two other QSL's and this location had the best service by far.  The food is typical bar food, but is good and priced right.  The staff here is friendly and attentive.  The music isn't stupidly loud like other QSL's I've been to.  This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Would not go back again.  I ate there last night with my boyfriend and we both were sick after eating a small amount of wings and we were sick through to the next morning!"}
{"text":"6:30 AM - great place for a quick breakfast. Sit down or take it with you. I sat down to an eggs & sausage breakfast. Looked at the nice menu and looks like they are a good place to go. This is a chaoin place that has restaurants around Celveland so they know what to do and do it well for an airport restaurant..Also the food was Not airport hurry and get it out. I think they want you to return next trip. I will.."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, nice atmosphere and great staff! A lot of food options! It's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I like a good wing and my fave is the Lube! My personal fave are Arizona Ranch (a mix of hot sauce and ranch dressing) and Buckeye Barbecue (sweet and tangy with a bite). The wings are crispy, so you can't ask for much more. Also had the fried pickles and they were quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice and both times they have gotten my order wrong. Will not be ordering again for this mediocre food. Would rather go to McDonalds. If you want wings head over to Wings Over Madison which is right down the road."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is inexpensive and the breakfast sandwich is pretty filling. Really friendly waitress."}
{"text":"My husband & I were in search of a place with a patio to have a beer & Sunday lunch, so as we were heading to Concord thought we would try Quaker steak out since I had never tried it before.

It was a gorgeous sunny day & they did not have the chairs or tables set & ready to accommodate outside guests. Once we sat down the server who was nice but very young, inexperienced & didn't have a clue what the specials of the day were came to greet us. He quickly informed us that most of  their beer taps were not in service & the beer menu had not been updated in quite some time since only about 4 out of 10 were available. After three times of him in & out of checking what they had we finally got our 2 draft miller lites (meh).

The food arrived pretty fast, I ordered the chicken finger basket (thinking this would be the safest option after the issues that we already had). They had a ton of breading on them & weren't my favorite. 

My husband ordered the mild buffalo wings & I had to try one....I am glad I did because they were actually really tasty!

All in all I will not be coming back anytime soon- for $40 (with two beers each & tip) we could go somewhere MUCH nicer with better quality food & atmosphere."}
{"text":"While the food is classic there is a significant service and sanitary opportunity here. The waiter rushes you into your order and makes it feel like its your last chance....Food is not presented as advertised and there is no explanation. \"We dont have cherries\"...And no one will look for them until you find a huge container sitting on the bar. If you dont finish your milkshake(thats missing cherries) you may be asked why you didn't order a to go cup to begin with.....if you ask for extra spooons the waiter may personally bless the surface of each one with her fingers vs delivering by the handle. Last but not least the bartender may lick her fingers and then proceed to cut an orange for you.All this and when you complain the manager will offer to make you another and gives you $10 off for your next visit...... not what it used to be. Hopefully it was just a bad night..."}
{"text":"Okay, first off, I should be killed for my previous review. I'm such a turdlicker. Got some to go wings and a Philly cheesesteak . Wings were parm black pepper flavor. Robust flavor, meaty, totally good job. Sandwich was good, not a lot of cheese and came with great fries. I'm something of a cheesesteak connoisseur at this point. I tend to get it everywhere. Yes, I've had one in the actual city of Philly. No, it was not at those two rival places full of greaseballs they always show on travel programs. Anyhow, what was with that first review, amiright? So much for the vegetarian thing. I must have been high and or on my period. This place is great and I had no issues with my last visit. Well, one. I dig the old timey gas pumps and license plates. But the giant aluminum ghetto rims? Why? I don't want to eat at NTB."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, so we had to see what all the hype was about for this place. Next time I will go to buffalo wild wings. I ordered some wings and a side of macaroni and cheese. My fiance got the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese. My food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. It was luke warm and the side of mac and cheese was tiny for the price you pay. It was hardly a \"boat\" of mac and cheese as it states on the menu. My fiance's food was at least hot, but nothing over the top. I've only heard good things about this place, hopefully our next experience will be better. The service was great, however."}
{"text":"Sorry excuse for a restaurant table is sticky, so is the floor. Service is very slow.  Everything in this place is sticky. Restrooms are horrible. Their excuse is the kids were here before. Just clean this disgusting place up.  Not exaggerating it is disgusting. Just clean a bit."}
{"text":"One star for the food being ok. The service was horrible. Four tables in the whole restaurant and we waited 20 minutes for drinks. Our food even came before we received our drink order. Frustrated and in need of beverages to wash down our hot wings we go to the bar to get some. The waitress finally comes back with our drinks and asks us where we got ours. When we tell her where, she immediately cops an attitude with us. She is rude until we ask to speak to a manager. The manager comes over and we explain the situation. The manager agrees that the waitress should not have handled the table in the manner that she did and tells us she will have the waitress apologize and a round of drinks is on the house. The waitress never apologized and was pretty silent the rest of the time we were there, but more attentive this time. We received our checks and some of us were charged for drinks despite what the manager had told us. No big deal, that is easily corrected. The problem I had with this place was the service and the way that the waitress had treated us like an inconvenience. I had problems in the past with the service at this restaurant and was reluctant to try it again after years of boycott. Safe to say I will not be returning to Quakerstate, especially not the Robinson location."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Both times at the invitation of a friend or I otherwise wouldn't set foot in the joint.

Quaker Steak was everything I expected. Disappointing food quality and lousy service both times. 

Dry, as in almost no sauce, wings that were overcooked. You must ask for extra sauce to get the kind of Buffalo wings I've eaten in many places around the country for decades."}
{"text":"1 star is generous. Terrible food. Terrible service. There are too many good restaurants to waste your time here."}
{"text":"For an airport it's really not bad. Had the lubeburger and fries. Portion was good and it was well dressed but I had to knock off a star because of the meat quality. The patty was that square frozen constancy you get from a box. Service was above average for an airport restaurant"}
{"text":"Nice way to get quick wings, but don't expect your servers to come around and offer anything. Think of it more like McDonald's and less like Quaker Steak and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed this time. They got rid of the boom boom sauce which was really disappointing. Service was horrendous. I had to ask for water refills, clear the plates off the table please, he was just not very attentive  at all even though they weren't busy."}
{"text":"This is the best place hands down to take a kid out to eat.  My sons dinner started out with fresh cheddar gold fish crackers with a side of while milk followed by chicken fingers done just right and apple sauce.  If your a 4 year old this place is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer :Its at the ballpark, which means your gonna pay extra!!

This place is pretty good, nothing super special. Wings were cooked the way they are suppose to be. Service is just what you expect at the ballpark concessions!

All in all, its not a game changer and pretty pricey, but they are good wings!"}
{"text":"I live on the west coast and look forward to stopping at QSL every time I am in town. Quick, reliable and priced fairly"}
{"text":"Generally good service when we've dined in. Wings are good and the fried pickles are fantastic!"}
{"text":"One of the places my fiancée and brother like to come for some chicken wings and beer. That's all we every get here. The beer and mixed drinks are always great. The atmosphere is cool and the wings are always great! We always try a new flavor when we come or use the take out window. It's nice that the waitresses never try to feel like you have to leave. Definitely one of our go to spots."}
{"text":"The wing buffet lunch on Tuesdays is worth every single penny! Plenty of sauces to choose from and you can even request sauces not on the line to be delivered to your table. I highly recommend the Arizona ranch.

To be honest, the food is great on any day. They served bottled root beer and some awesome appetizers as well proper wings. They beat the BWW hype with juicy, super crisp, hearty wings. Always a classic with my family, and we even take a cute picture with their atomic hot sauce truck very often. Not to mention, it's right off of 90!"}
{"text":"A good place for kids, since the interior is similar to a pit stop or garage with a car/motorcycle theme.  I guess they do well on alcohol sales, because there are 2 distinct bar areas.  I was seated in Scotty's bar area, and he had me try a fantastic pale ale.  The food is similar to Buffalo Wild Wings, if you have ever been there.  It's mostly sandwiches, salads, wraps, and chicken wings.  On a day where the temperatures hit -5 F, the hot food and prompt service were definitely appreciated.  Sit in Scotty's section if you want some local knowledge or need advice on beer!"}
{"text":"I should have followed suit and put on my fat man pants as everyone else did that ate here. Can you blame them? The portions of yummy greasy food with a huge pitcher of beer to help wash down the grease. 

I'm here on a business trip with my colleagues. The toughest part of being with co-workers is not being able to be yourself. After drowning down my first beer I really wanted another, but would be bad when it's only lunch time? My pencil skirt wasn't letting in anymore room from the wings we ordered. Definitely not the easiest thing to eat while trying not to get anything on your clothes. 

Definitely if you don't need to worry about being messy order the wings. Don't bother with the boneless wings, not worth the time to eat. But just a warning this place gives the impression that it hasn't been wiped down in ages. I felt dirty leaving here, and it's dirty in a garbage way not the sexy raunchy way."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars right now I would. It's not that busy and I have been sitting here for 20 Minutes when I was seated and haven't spoken or seen a soul. No drink. No order. Nothing. 


On the plus side, after I called the manager, I did get my meal paid for so... they did do that at least. Thanks Mike. 

That's service."}
{"text":"This place was just amazing, the atmosphere was inviting with lots of car memorabilia and actual cars above you. This place is known for their wings, so I got their endless boneless wings (Thursday only). I was a huge fan of their Thai 'R' Cracker flavor as well as Louisiana Lickers. The service was kind and accommodating . As a Chicago land native I'm used to Buffalo Wild Wings...... Well no more can I eat wings there. This place was great!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to be ignored. NON EXISTENT customer service (7/2). Seated in the bar area - placed order - got drinks and then waited for food. After about 20min turned to look for waitress who was among 5 wait staff just hanging and talking.I asked where's our food? Told me she was waiting on wings. She didn't come over to tell us just disappeared into the kitchen. 5mins more asked another waitress to get ours - not friendly, as we were done waiting. Still no waitress. Our waitress handle this poorly by just hiding in the kitchen and not offering an apology or to at least bring the pretzels we ordered. So we went to the bar to pay for our drink and to just leave. Another group of 3 just hanging out. IF I have to interrupt these groups while they are talking then they are not ATTENTIVE staff. We paid for drink and left. Not one apology from the 1st or 2nd waitress, or the bartender. If it was busy I'd get it. BUT there was only a 4 top booth and us in that area. Just such a lack of customer service. If your kitchen is slow then let me know. But ignoring us to just chat with coworkers means no business from us."}
{"text":"Oh Thai r' Cracker wings, why are you so good?  Some of the best wings in Madison.  Tuesdays are all you can eat.  My favorite are the hot buffalo wings and the Thai 'r Crackers.  Very similar to Buffalo Wild Wings though."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but I didn't feel it lived up to the hype that I had heard so much about since moving to Madison.  It was a cool atmosphere for those that like 50's vintage style.  The food and service doesn't reflect that but they're plenty of awesome artifacts to look at from history.

Prices were also descent, as was the service.  I was impressed by the variety of options on the menu.  With that said, there should be plenty of options for the family.  There is a bar area separate from the restaurant but it seemed really loud in there so I am not sure it's a place I would enjoy a drink or bring a date.

If you are visiting Madison and want to stay away from downtown, it's a nice alternative."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet used to be great but lately it's gone down hill. The bartenders used to be better as well. Not looks wise just friendly wise..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is kind of cool.  It's a good place to watch the game.  There are tons of TVs, so you know you will have a good view no matter where you sit.  

As far as the food goes, I don't think I would eat here again. I had a combo basket with boneless wings and pretzels.  The wings were very dry...they were coated in sauce, but the chicken itself was dry. The pretzels were bland.  I tried my husband's cheese fries and they were nothing special either.  Our friend said his burger was \"okay, but nothing special.\""}
{"text":"Great place to go after or before movie. Fiance ordered wings and loved flavor said could be crispier and also had the onion rings   I ordered Asian chicken bowl with rice and broccoli  so much food will not have to cook at all tomkrrow. Tuesday nites they have a buffet for $13.99  which includes a beverage  salad and wings and fries and Mac n cheese and all their sauces out to use  food looked fresh a lot of people doing the all u can eat at 10p and the staff made sure to keep bringing out the food.  Waitress was attentive and brought iced tea refills without being asked."}
{"text":"You can get better wings and beer at a much better price on just about any block in Lakewood west of Bunts unless you like amusement park atmosphere with a NASCAR theme. Walk on past this place."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Give it a general thumbs up. Good wings and burgers. Don't recommend the steak. Some memorable times at karaoke nights here. The bar manager in the main bar area (to the right when you come in) is a good guy - once I complained because my wings were legitimately cold and without much sauce. Sent me a new, fresh+hot round of wings with plenty of sauce and comped a good portion of the meal. That's really the only time ive ever had a bad experience, and he made up for it."}
{"text":"It's what you'd expect from the lube. Drinks are self service and \"because it's on a campus\" there is no AYCE wings. BUT they do have booze, which is always a plus. It's in the basement of the campus, which is a little confusing to get to, but whatever works. There's nothing great to write about this place because if you've been to one, you've been to them all. If you haven't visited, I suggest you go to one that offers AYCE option and figure out what sauces you like first."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location. The waiter Aaron was very nice. We decided to try the loaded nachos with chicken.  The nachos were enough for 2. They came either with chicken or pulled pork. They were the best I have ever had,  very tasty with a little kick. I love the decor and the tall beer was ice cold. Vodka lemonade was also good"}
{"text":"My son likes to go because of the cool stuff! They need new chairs the plastic lawn chairs are not comfortable if you have to sit more than 10 minutes! 
Food is hit or miss but staff is usually very nice."}
{"text":"Like the concept, but the service left me wanting a bit.  Went here for lunch the other day - it was actually one of my co-worker's birthday so we all went as a group... there was six of us.  We got there around 11:45 and it was not busy at all... we got seated promptly and then ordered.... our waitress was pretty friendly and even made some jokes.  We were all in good spirits, until it started taking a long time for our food to arrive.  The dining room started filling up slowly... but I didn't think it was overly busy.  One of the guys at our table checked with the waitress and she went back and checked on our food.  It still took a while after that for the food to actually arrive.

And they also got one of the orders wrong (switched with another table).  My co-worker thought it was his order... so he started eating it.... then we found out later that he wasn't crazy (as much as he usually is) and that he was eating the wrong thing.  They still let him have his original order, but that meant that someone else in the dining room was going to have to wait that much longer to get their food.

I had ordered the All You Can Eat wings (since it was Tuesday)... but I didn't get to take full advantage since the service was so slow.  It was for the best, but still I felt a little disappointed I didn't get to stuff my face with as many wings as I could.

Our food came around 12:30ish... so I thought that was a bit excessive.  I don't know if they had problems in the kitchen... but when a manager brings out your food - that may be saying something.  She looked a little lost as well.

I'll definitely come here again, but I am just a little weary...."}
{"text":"I used to love going to the old QS&L location when they had one at Park Rd Shopping Center so I was happy to find out that this restaurant was now open.

This restaurant is in the Centrum Shopping Center across from Home Depot in Pineville.  It's in the former location of Joe's Crab Shack and a steakhouse that didn't last long there.

The inside of the restaurant is decorated with NASCAR and Harley Davidson memorabilia.  There are two cars attached to the ceiling...a light blue corvette and a NASCAR car signed by Jeff Burton.  There is also a motorcycle on the other side of the restaurant.   Also scattered across the restaurant are about 20 flat-screen TVs.  There are video games and other arcade games inside the front door in the waiting area.  

The seating in here is plastic resin chairs and typical square tables. The most comfortable seating appears to be a the bar.   The also have a large patio outside in which some seats are under a canopy and others are not.  

The menu consists of wings, sandwiches, salads, and more.  There are about 20 flavors of wings.  They have All you can eat Wing nights on Tuesdays and All you can Eat Boneless wing night on Wednesdays.

I had two kinds of wings...the golden garlic and the Hot.  What I remember about their wings in the other locations is they were quite small but they must have changed something there because the wings were of decent size.  The sauces were good but not the best I've tasted. 

I looked over the beer list and their was nothing that really stood out to me...Typical chain restaurant beer selection.  Not even a Yuengling which surprised me since I think this chain is based in PA, home of Yuengling.  

Service-wise, I was confused.  I had two people waiting on me and I wasn't sure who was doing what.  And when the one person brought me a to go drink and asked me if I wanted my check.  Seemed a little flawed here and slow toward the end of my meal.  But otherwise, they were friendly.  

It might be a decent place for lunch once they get some of the service kinks fixed but I can't see myself coming here for dinner when there are better locally-owned wing places around."}
{"text":"For good wings, come here for the lunch buffets and the tuesday dinner buffet they have! Or just order some wings! The usual buffalo style wings are good (they do the sauce type here) but its really the louisiana lickers that keep me coming back!

This is definitely a college crowd type of place, don't even bother coming for the tuesday dinner buffet during breaks cause the wait can easily go up to 2 hrs. The place is decked out like its name suggested, they have gas pumps in the front and then there are race cars and anything associated with the road everywhere. It's a fun place to go for wings. Service has always been quick and attentive.

Drinks come with a twisty colored straw, and twizzlers come at the end of every meal. The menu is chock full of deep fried appetizers, and a multitude of other \"healthy\" options, and about 25 different types of wings. My fave is the LA licker, tangy, spicy, and sweet all at the same time. Tried the atomic once...was not worth it...its so spicy it just tastes nasty. Other flavors are good, some better than others, but prolly more to personal taste than anything.

The tuesday dinner buffet used to be order at the table. Which meant the wings were fresh and hot when it got to your table. To be more cost effective, its now buffet style, so sometimes wings are colder but they give you salad and dessert and some appetizer items too now. Lunch buffet is better in that they serve different things on different days, and if the flavor wing you want isn't out, you can order it with your server. 

I really haven't been able to find a place that does better wings than here. One place that does really good regular buffalo wings, but no variation. I just have to keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had, bar none. There are all types of wings here--spicy, mild, wet, dry, and everything in between. This is the place that convinced me of the greatness of chicken wings. While I believe there are plenty of great reasons to become a vegetarian, this place (and Hoggy's, located right down the street) are two places that will ensure that I remain an omnivore as long as they are open.

All-you-can-eat wing nights on which the wait staff don't mind if you sit and graze like a cow, making sure that you get a few wings of each of their many flavors.

Plenty of TV's all over the restaurant so you can cheer on your favorite teams while munching on great food.

Need I say more?

If I must...if you don't like wings, this is still a great place to go--their other food--such as their ribs--are quite good, and the antenna of onion rings is another must-order."}
{"text":"I had the Arizona Ranch Boneless Breaded wings, unique and delicious.

Biker bar atmosphere.  I went in the winter, I bet this place is awesome in the summer.

Also had the BBQ Chicken Quesadilla.

Waitress recommended both and they're indeed delicious."}
{"text":"I ate 2 meals here while in Pittsburgh. They brag they have the best wings in america, and they are damn good. Great variety of flavors, cajun was the best. Real bbq o-ring sandwich lived up to its award winning status. Thundersteak was disappointing, avoid that one. Atmosphere is fantastic for watching sports and the wait staff is energetic and engaging. Some very cool old cars hanging around the place as well."}
{"text":"So, the location is placed incorrectly on the map, but this is the listing for the location inside the airport. I'm not sure why I've been going to the Pub every time I'm at the airport and hating every experience there that's filled with ridiculously horrible service and mediocre food, when right down the B terminal lies Quaker Steak & Lube.

The food here is good, in my opinion. Good fries, good wings, and AMAZING fried pickles - always get the jalapeño ranch! Very tasty - with just the right kick. Their beer selection is fine for the airport and most importantly, their service is great! Always fast and always friendly. I've encountered some of the worst service at the airport between the Pub and Great Lakes (Panini's hasn't been too bad) - so it's a nice, refreshing change to see some great service at this airport restaurant! 

It's not like the Cleveland airport is ridiculously big, so regardless of what terminal I'm flying out of, if I want some drinks and food, I'll definitely be returning here instead of the other options the airport has to offer.

PS some tables that line the walls are right next to an outlet, so be sure to scope those out when you seat yourself if you need to charge up before your flight."}
{"text":"The wings are good, but The quality of the salad was awful it seemed like a dollar bag of dole shreded cole slaw prep in a box with some carrots and a light sprinkle of blue cheese on top . I will stick to the wings next time"}
{"text":"The kids menu is fantastic as it doubles as a coloring pad and all the food is also pictured in drawings so for those kids too young to read yet they still can choose what they want without description.

The menu is mainly sandwiches, steaks and wings with salads, other sandwiches and sides in the mix.  There is ideally a good choice for anyone in your family.  

Our service was very quick and polite, but you also walk past some arcade games and claw machines sporting some prizes in there your competitive family member might want.  The music is also pretty loud, so this isn't the place to take someone who wants to chat or you might want to brush up on lip reading.  But the decor is fun car pictures, tools and there are tons of tubs with sporting events on and the cocktail menu is decent.  And there are real vehicles hanging from the ceiling and a car as well.  

Very family friendly as I don't think anyone would blink an eye if your toddler screams or dances in the middle of the restaurant like the one two tables down from me.  No one even bothered to glance their way.

The food is mid-priced $7-10 for most sandwiches/apps but it was flavored well and cooked perfectly.  The chicken was not dry at all.  Fries were deep fried but not full of salt.  And we got Twizzlers with the check.  Always fun!"}
{"text":"I go here from time to time it's expensive if your drinking too but I love the bbq wings they make it worth it love the sauce its got a brown sugar taste.its a fun environment I really like the motorcycles and stuff hanging from the ceiling. Kids really enjoy coming here and staff is very enjoyable and friendly."}
{"text":"Was there last night 2/17/18, nachos soggy, wings undercooked even though I asked for crispy. Received a shot of Jameson in a wet dirty glass. The floor was filthy with food,utensils, and grime."}
{"text":"Great service but the restaurant is filthy. Dust everywhere, and bathroom was gross. The place needs a serious detailing."}
