{"text":"Rise Bakery and Cafe is not your average, run-of-the-mill bakery.  They are renowned for their daily fresh-baked chocolate bread. The chocolate sour dough bread is baked with Bernard Callebaut chocolate and sundried cherries, and rarely has time to cool before being snapped up. I'm told that a slice of this bread, paired with a cup of their FAIR TRADE ORGANIC certified coffee, is a match made in heaven.  Besides the bread, this counter-service only cafe also offers a variety of hot and cold sandwiches and soups. I had a soup and half sandwich combo. The daily soup was minestrone, which was hearty, almost like a vegetarian stew. The smoked turkey sandwich was a unique and pleasant combination of flavours - it had sweet onion relish, sliced pear, and Oka cheese served on an apple, rosemary, and flax sourdough. It was all tasty, but a little on the paltry side considering the price tag. The combo included a small cookie, which was chocolately and pretty good."}
{"text":"Yuck! Ignorant customer service!  I was waiting in line to order for 10 minutes then this girl on retail picked the guy behind me when it's obviously my turn! I gave her a dirty look and the guy have noticed that I've been there before him and so it's so nice of him to let me get a service first before him but that girl didn't even said nothing! Even an apology. By the way the hot chocolate that I had from them was rancid from bad milk and has a fruitfly!!! Never will go back there! Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love bread, and loved baked goods. I was really looking forward to this bakery and had high hopes that this would be a good option for me.  My coworkers and I decided to try rise bakery for lunch.  I had a vegetarian sandwich. At best I can say it was average,I was expecting the bread to blow me away, but unfortunately it did not. My 2 coworkers both ordered sandwich, one was a chicken sandwich and my friend commented on how nice the chicken salad was, with a hint of lemon mixed in.  I have to say that the lunch was tainted by bad service. Now I have to emphasize there is little service required as it is an order at the counter, wait for sandwich type of place, not sit down.  They were unwilling to make any sandwich that was not already in the  display case.  There were things on the menu that were not in the case  ( although the signage in the case indicated they had some in there at one point). When asked to make something on the menu, they would not.  A bit of a bummer.   I also had  a peanut butter cookie ( I think it was peanut butter) and it  was quite good....all that said, considering the cost  ( not cheap) and the newness of the business they may want to recognize that most people value good customer service, above all else."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about RISE BAKERY for a while now but was yet to make the trek over to Bow Valley Square to check it out. RISE is conveniently located near the RBC bank in Bow Valley right off the 2nd street SW entrance. Their special today was the grilled cheese sandwich, which of course I paired with the tomato basil soup. The sandwich had some yummy gourmet cheese on there, tomatoes and proscuitto ( I think) .  The soup was good - definitely a homemade taste and not runny. The lunch was on the higher end for price - 11.45$ with no drink, but it was delicious.  There is nothing quite like dipping a grilled cheese in tomato soup."}
