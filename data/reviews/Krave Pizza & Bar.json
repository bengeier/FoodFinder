{"text":"Love it. The atmosphere is great. the service is incredible and is only outmatched by the quality of the food. The only place that i know of in airdrie where you can get a schooner of beer and a pickled egg. Which in my case is a huge plus. Love everyone who works there they are all very helpfull and attentive. I would reccomend this restaurant ove all others in airdrie. Krave will make you a repeat visitor the moment you enter the building. Keep it up krave."}
