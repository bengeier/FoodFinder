{"text":"Les crêpes snt excellentes ; il y en a pour tous les goûts : les traditionnelles complètes ou au beurre salées, et aussi pour les originaux : déclinaison autour des fruits de mers ou fromage. Les prix sont très raisonnables et les quantités sont parfaite (les grandes crêpes sont très copieuses! A ne pas rater!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Nice place to chill out. Ordered the midi express to share after just having breakfast twenty min ago The la Parisienne crepe was tasty and crispy with the gluten free Buck wheat crepe Sweet home made chocolate crepe tasted a little too oily though Free flow coffee refills Yay"}
{"text":"Quand je veux manger une bonne crêpe bretonne c'est du confort food, je m'attends pas à la haute gastronomie plutôt simplicité bien exécuté.  C'est exactement ce que j'ai reçu: une des bonnes soupes à l'oignon que j'ai mangé dans ma vie, une crêpe celtique (oeuf, poireaux, fromage de chèvre, tomates) croquante et savoureuse.  Le tout arrosé de cidre et calvados. L'ambiance est approprié minimaliste avec mûres blancs et excellent choix de musique avec un proprio sympathique avec petites attentions celtiques."}
{"text":"Je suis venue pour la première fois avec ma coloc dans ce petit restaurant. Après un temps de pluie et étant françaises, ce petit restaurant très frenchy a été comme une évidence pour nous. Les crêpes sont délicieuses, leurs cafés sont bons et le service est très agréable et attentionné. A tous les français qui ont le mal du pays, ce restaurant est parfait et a ceux qui veulent découvrir une nourriture typiquement française, c'est ici qu'il faut venir. L'ambiance est calme, le style est plutôt épuré et ils servent automatiquement un verre d'eau dès qu'on s'installe, plutôt agréable !"}
{"text":"Crèpe sucre was delicious and café au lait also. Super setting and staff    Eorth waiting to find on a long walk on Saint Laurent"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic crêperie... And the place is adorable! The people working there clearly have a passion for their cuisine. They are very friendly and inviting. I went there with my boyfriend and we both had a galette and a sweet crêpe, both of which leaving our taste buds wanting more but our stomachs very satisfied. I would recommend the ham, egg and spinach galette for the main meal and the homemade berry compote crêpe for dessert! ... We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Carrot and cumin soup, sunny side up egg on a parisienne galette and far breton. Such a great combo for lunch! Service was fast, attentive, very pleasant. I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"The waiter was rude and unhelpful. The restaurant wasn't full and were told they could not seat a party of 3. We asked if we could get take away and he bluntly replied \"no\". We said we only wanted 1 crepe to take away and he again just said \"no, too busy, we can't do take away.\" We had to prompt him as to how long the wait would be, and he reluctantly said \"at least 40 mins, customers get priority. \" He kept wanting to walk away and gave us the impression we were unwelcome. We won't be returning here."}
{"text":"After walking around in cold Montreal, we were hungry and wanted to grab a bite to eat. We had walked in front of this place and made our way back because it looked like an authentic place, plus we are also Frenchies and LOVE crepes!   We were not disappointed! The crepes and French Onion soup were super yummy. The service was quick and our waitress was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple friends for brunch this Sunday. All I can say is awesome!! Immediately when we walked in we were happily greeted by the hostess and given a table. The atmosphere was great, and my French friends said it reminded her of some small family owned French cafe's she used to go to.  In regards to our food, everything was amazing! I ordered Le Breton combo. The galette with egg, ham, and Swiss was delicious and very filling, a good size for the price especially considering it came with fresh fruit, great coffee, a sample of their homemade mango-banana-strawberry juice, and a dried plum pudding cake for dessert. Really excellent, food, service, and atmosphere! All around just a perfect experience!"}
{"text":"This is in my opinion the best crêperie in Montreal. I had the table d'hôtes with the rillettes, carotte and ginger soup which were absolutely amazing. Then I had the chevrette with fresh and juicy tomatoes, amazing. Finally I had the chocolate banana Crêpes, simply the best Crêpes I've ever had. Crispy and smooth at the same time. And there espresso is very good too."}
{"text":"Best and most authentic French gallettes and crepes. Great service and a very nice looking restaurant. One of the best places to go in Montreal! Everything on the menu is spectacular, and if you come, do not forget the dessert! My favorite is the Snikers. The best dessert EVER! (And great service too!)"}
{"text":"Excellentes crêpes, accompagnées d'un bolée de cidre.... Le souper fut délicieux! Le café Breizh est un endroit fort sympathique, l'ambiance est chaleureuse et sans flafla.  Nous avons choisi les crêpes de sarrasin ( légères!) : la nordique, au saumon fumé, ainsi que la québécoise aux pommes, bacon et sirop d'érable. Un vrai régal, a prix d'ami."}
{"text":"Terrible service - slow, indifferent, inhospitable.  Mediocre food.  So many better places - don't waste your money."}
{"text":"These crêpes were excellent! I've had crepes in Paris at another breizh cafe and this was comparable. The buckwheat \"sarrasin\" was perfect - lacey and crispy without being chewy. The \" Québécois \" was super as was \"la vege\" with caramélized onions. Everything from service to the quality of the food was super here. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We loved it.  Delicious hot chocolae.  Crepes were perfection.   Even my 5yo eat it all and he is super picky.   Orange juice was fresh.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service is really slow and unfriendly to americans. Unfortunately my friends and i have run into this quite a bit in Montreal especially at restaraunts."}
{"text":"Wonderful buckwheat crepes. Both savory and sweet. Obviously better to eat on site than to go, but the latter is an option if you are in a time crunch. I stopped here a few times on my way to the Mainline Theatre. I especially enjoyed the one with goat cheese, tomatoes, and caramelized onions and the one with apple, bacon, and maple syrup."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday and was seated right away. Had their 3 course meal to share with a friend for about $35 after tax and tip. The food was served quickly, and the waitress was very attentive and friendly. My friend loved the french onion soup and wanted to order a second bowl. The crepe isn't as sweet as other places but I enjoyed it nonetheless."}
{"text":"The food and the waitress was very warm and attentive. The food was pretty good and a fair value for what you get. We did the set fixed menu option and It was $72 CAD after tax and tip for a three course meal for two."}
{"text":"Great galettes, beautifully made -- crispy in just the right amounts and really yummy.   What I fell in love with are the crepes though, in particular the crepe suzette.   I also really enjoyed the cider -- I even bought some home with me.  The service was great and the cafe has a great atmosphere.   I come back here every time I come to Montreal.  Amazing place."}
{"text":"The savory crepes were delicious! Cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. Mine had two sunny side eggs inside with yolks intact, when you slice the crepe open it smothers it with the yolk - so good. They are enormous as well, the grande version of any of the crepes, without any sides will stuff a burly man with ease. Service was excellent too, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Au vu des notes élevées sur Yelp je m'attendais à du très bon mais finalement j'ai été un peu décu.  Je tiens à souligner que j'ai commandé à emporter via Foodora et n'ai donc ni visité le restaurant ni fait expérience du service que je ne peux donc pas juger.  Les galettes de sarrasin en elle-mêmes sont plutôt bonnes, je les aime un peu plus croustillantes d'habitude, mais en livraison, c'est forcément un peu plus difficile, alors je ne peux pas leur reprocher.  Par contre concernant les garnitures, déception. J'en ai essayé 2 : - la Chevrette (fromage de chèvre, tomates et oignons caramélisés) : le fromage et les oignons sont bons, mais les tomates n'apportent rien côté goût et détrempent le tout, c'est dommage - la Celtique (oeuf, fromage de chèvre, fondue de poireaux, oignons caramélisés) : l'ensemble est plutôt harmonieux, mais je ne sais pas si c'est la fondue de poireaux ou l'assaisonnement de la crêpe, mais c'était beaucoup beaucoup trop salé et a rendu la crêpe difficile à terminer  Côté livraison, délais très rapides et emballage soigné."}
{"text":"Craving for some crepe and this place totally satisfying. Crepes were so tasty and crispy. My hubby ordered the 3 course. Pork pate was ok, but his pork and leek crepe was amazing. His meal ended with a chocolate, salted caramel crepe, yes more crepe because it was just that delicious. I ordered the québécois, the mix of caramelized apples with bacon and maple syrup was well balanced. It was so good that I ordered another chestnut cream crepe to finish my meal. I love this French style crepe."}
{"text":"Superbe ! J'y suis allée avec ma fille d'un an, et nous nous sommes régalées toutes les deux. J'ai pris la dâme Hélène (poire, chocolat, amandes, glace vanille) et une crêpe xonfiture framboise pour ma fille. C'était une fête des mères inoubliable."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite cafe in Montreal so far.   FOOD All the crepes are thin and well done with a chewy texture and a nice crisp. I got to try a couple from the menu during my 2 visits. My personal favorites are as follow:  Meal - La Parisienne (ham, Swiss cheese, bechemel sauce, mushrooms) - the melted Swiss cheese and bechemel sauce inside the warm close phased crepe give a creamy texture.  Dessert - Caramel Au Beurre Sale (salted caramel butter) - the crepe is not overly sweet due to the combination of caramel and salted butter. Sweetness is just right for my personal preference.  If you are craving for both salty and sweet crepes, La Quebecoise (cooked apple, bacon, Swiss cheese, maple syrup) is not a bad choice either!   AMBIENCE The environment was quite nice with some soft background music. Two of the tables are close to the glass sliding doors, which are opened during the day. You can enjoy some sunlight if the weather is nice.   STAFF The servers are all very polite and friendly. My family and I visited here 2 days in a row. On our first night, the server was considerate and told us right away when we entered the cafe that the card machine was not working before we were seated. My mom and I were looking for the washroom after our meal and the server told us immediately before we even asked.   PRICE  Price is reasonable. Crepes range from $5 to $19 before tax (from very plain to ones with scallop and salmon). A person would spend on average $15 including tips and tax (assuming you're getting a classic crepe with protein and a cup of regular coffee)."}
{"text":"Fast and very friendly service. Kid friendly place with delicious crepes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the crepes were tasty.  I enjoyed the cider and the creme brulee was legit."}
{"text":"Decent, but not great. My crepe was a little overcooked and the cider was not great. They have a very reasonable lunchtime deal."}
{"text":"Best galettes, AND crepes, in Montreal. And so far, on this side of the Atlantic (and better than many in France). They even perfectly cook the egg sunny side up!! Service was great the first time, not so much the second time (waiter was not friendly, let us wait for ages before taking our order, even for beverage, whereas the restaurant was almost empty but for another table of 4 guys who he obviously preferred to interact with) - reason for the loss of one star."}
{"text":"One of my favorte creperies in Montreal. Such great food and service and you must try their far breton!"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive service. I ordered the Nordic crepe and it was delicious. The waiter did a good job throughout."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Montreal for one week. I found this little cafe on a long walk and had to try it the next evening for dinner. We spent a week in Bretagne four years ago (mostly in Auray) and loved the crepes there. Well, Breizh Cafe in Montreal was every bit as good as any we had in Northwest France. The service was friendly. It is not a fast place to eat, but so pleasant that there was no hurry. We had two savory crepes and a dessert crepe flamed with Grand Marnier. Tres delicieux."}
{"text":"This place was really great. The food was amazing. The coffee was great. The waitress was great. The service was very quick. I loved the whole experience from start to finish. I'm not that crazy about crepes but they do it differently at this place and I have wanted to go back ever since. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 with reservation and they were very accommodating. They waited until everyone arrived and all our orders came pretty altogether considering they only have like 3 crepe skillets.   Food was great, I ordered the one with egg, goat cheese and creamed leeks and it was super tasty! The goat cheese was strong but not too much, creamed leek was the best part. I liked dipping each of my pieces into the yolk. However considering the prices the portion could be more.   I also ordered the far breton dessert, which is a flan cake with raisin-like pieces. It was different but still good, it was my first time having real flan cake so I don't have a good reference :P   This is definitely a place I'd bring people to!"}
{"text":"One of the best crepes I ever had was here. Service was a bit slow (only one waitress working), but super friendly. No complaints. Would totally go back when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch, we both tried the Le Canadien and weren't disappointed -- they brought a nice mixed-fruit juice to start. Excellent small side of pork and beans. Service was excellent, atmosphere is great too. Coffee good, very good cappuccino."}
{"text":"Une crêperie comme je les aime.   L'accueil est très convivial, la salle est modeste, avec un mur de briques blanches et des peintures sobres.  Quelques drapeaux Bretons, une musique adaptée et typiquement française.   Une table d'hôte très correcte, avec un choix d'entrée, de galettes au sarrasin et de crêpes au froment (sans gluten ?).  Les rillettes de porc avaient un véritable goût de \"trop peu\" tellement elles étaient bonnes ! La galette croquante et en même temps moelleuse et réconfortante (une noix de beurre demi-sel l'aurait rendu parfaite). La crêpe, très bonne et sans regret.   Bref, c'est ma nouvelle crêperie, je l'ai adoptée et je ne regrette plus la fermeture de \"la bulle au carré\"....  Une bonne note pour la serveuse, très sympathique et serviable !  Pour deux personnes, tables d'hôte complètes, cidre breton (Kerissac) et cafés = 84$ (taxes et pourboire inclus)."}
{"text":"They must have been having a bad day in the kitchen when we visited. Our crepes were overlooked and my wife's was tasteless. I didn't believe her until I tasted it myself. Service was excellent. We picked this from Yelp because it had so many great reviews. I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I've only had crepes probably less than a handful number of times. They're often soggy and dense where I'm from in the U.S. so I'm always a bit hesitant to order them. However, when we crossed the border into Québec, I made it a mission to eat as many as I can. Now that I'm back home, I'm totally screwed since I now get frequent cravings and can't get anything remotely close to these amazingly crisp, warm, delicious (and relatively inexpensive) crepes.   I had 2 savory crepes, and one sweet one (mind you this was only breakfast) and I can't begin to describe how good they are. The buckwheat crepes are very different to what I'm used to; very mild in flavor, crisp, and light. The filling to crepe ratio was perfect. The dessert hazelnut crepe was also the bomb; brilliant play on textures. & of course I had to add ice cream.  Interior was very modern and hip. Breizh is perfect for dates and mingling and the service was fantastic. Great coffee as well; highly recommend the visit!"}
{"text":"I loved this place from beginning to end. We did not have a long wait and the buckwheat crepes were really really good. The sweet ones as well. We had a great time and they were accommodating to my 2 year old as well. Great experience and would go back."}
{"text":"J'ai testé le menu petit breton classique : galette jambon / fromage / oeufs, crêpe au caramel beurre salé accompagnées d'une bolée de cidre. La qualité était au rdv (validée par un breton ;)), et le tout pour 16$ est un excellent choix de lunch !"}
{"text":"The best crepes I have ever had!! There are so many options for flavor both savory and sweet. Definitely a must try if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"Food was hot and super tasty. The server was from Paris and extremely friendly. We even got up to watch the crepe master in action. All crepes were made out of buckwheat flour which made them gluten free and extra delicious!  For dessert we had a sweet crepe with home made caramel and it was to die for! Would recommend their crepes to anyone!"}
{"text":"Service: very friendly and helpful. There are several choices in the menu and looked yummy and our waitress was very kind to recommend the popular choices in galettes and crepes.  Food: stars of the night - we got the galette with feta, leek, egg and caramelised onion and also the caramelised Apple crepe, both recommended by the waitress. The galette was crispy and very tasty, the crepe was soft and right amount of sweetness. Both my wife and I cleaned up our plates! Overall, great place in a lively neighbourhood, very good food and friendly.. we wanted to come back again! Next time we travel to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place. Amazing service and really good crepes too. The server was so sweet and nice and I had such a good time here :)"}
{"text":"Wow. Between the food & the service this was by far my favorite place of my trip. It was mid afternoon, it wasn't too busy. I ordered two crepes & both were delicious! The snickers crepe was my favorite, I would have preferred milk chocolate but dark chocolate was good as well. Our waiter was very friendly! We will be back!"}
{"text":"the restaurant was excellent. In fact it was so good we ended up going twice on a four day visit to Montreal. We tried a variety of different crapes and each of them was excellent. We especially liked the Québecois. Lovely people super friendly. It does get busy on the weekends so if you get a chance call ahead and make a reservation. My son especially enjoyed a crêpe called la completes Tomates. Le uf sur le crêpe était très bon."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonably priced. We waited 30 minutes for a table. I probably would not have waited if I had to do it all over.   Had the ham and Swiss to start. Good but a bit dry. Then the caramel crepe for dessert it was delicious but could have used a little more caramel!"}
{"text":"Two of us visited Breizh Cafe and ordered the weekday lunch specials which come with tea or coffee, soup or salad, and several crepe choices. We had the \"complété\" (ham, Swiss, and sunny side up egg) and veggie (Swiss, onions, spinach, tomato). There were multiple tea choices. We enjoyed the soup du jour which was carrot and ginger. The crepes were great, light, and not greasy at all (which we have found at crêperies in Paris). Very happy with this place and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love crepes. Especially salted caramel & caramelised apples.   This place has that.   I love this place."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of creperies in Montreal and this one is absolutely the best! The crepes are cooked the best way with the best ingredients!! Service was amazing and the cider is a must! I definitely recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers! My perfectly cooked nutella crepe with bananas hit the spot. Soft yet crispy in parts but never soggy, this buttery sweetness was exactly was I was looking for. Minus 1 star for not readily getting drinks but I'm also a NYCer with high expectations and limited patience. I'm working on it!"}
{"text":"Bonne crêperie bretonne à Montréal mais sans plus. Ma galette ''La Complète'' (oeuf miroir, jambon, fromage suisse) 9,75$ était délicieuse par contre mon café latté 2,90$ était de mauvaise qualité, de style maison, il goûtait l'eau. Le service du propriétaire était bien. L'endroit est minimaliste avec un mur de brique. Il n'y avait personne dans ce café lors de ma visite en fin d'après-midi, très calme comme endroit. On vient qu'ici pour les crêpes/galettes quoi, c'est tout, j'irai prendre mon latté de qualité la prochaine fois au Café Névé après..."}
{"text":"Gluten-free buckwheat crepes! They were delicious. Nice and crispy on the outside but with a little bit of chew. Definitely different but welcomed into my tummy for sure.  They use regular crepe batter for dessert. We had the chocolate banana praline and the crepe suzette. Dang, both were a slam dunk. Crepes done right, for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious unpretentious crêpes, masterfully executed. Great service and food. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Do you like crepes? Are you ok with Buckwheat? Do you like a friendly atmosphere? Do you want a pokestop while you have breakfast?  Here is your spot. The crepes are great, really well balanced and large enough to fill you up. It is odd that they come as a square, but they still are tasty. Most of the savory crepes come on a buckwheat crepe, which is different but not bad. Im sure if you asked for regular crepe stuff, they would give it to you.   The dessert crepes are awesome, and I recommend getting one. You can split 2 crepes between 2 people and you would be good.   Only complaints were that the coffee was a little burnt and they were pricier than my local crepe place. All in all though, I would go back here.   Note: I didnt check out the shitter."}
{"text":"Très bonnes, service très sympa et en plus y'a du vrai cidre !"}
{"text":"Fairly priced and friendly service (though a bit slow, there was only one waitress).  I ordered the Nordic crepe and was quite satisfied, although it was a bit dry on the edges.  I am rating it 4 stars because it made me want to come back, perhaps i will try their brunch menu next time."}
{"text":"I'm eager to go back to this place, the crepes were delicious and they had a wide variety to choose from. The food was excellent but the service is so so."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! What a lovely and delicious way to spend my last few hours in Montreal, on a rainy afternoon. I recommend the French Onion soup, vegetarian buckwheat crepe and the chocolate crepe. Relaxed atmosphere and affordable as well."}
