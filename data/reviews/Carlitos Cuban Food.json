{"text":"For 5.00 you can congri (rice and beans combination), a meat (special of the day), and one side( maduro, yuca, tostones). Each meal varies each day. In addition, they do not skimp on their portions. Also, their cuban sandwich is 5.00. It's an official cuban sandwich. It is hearty sandwich too. You will not get a batido de mamey this cheap and taste so good. 2.50 for large shake. It's not too sweet nor heavy. It's a perfect batido. This place reminds me of the inexpensive cuban spots back in jersey. I always miss those spots because it's cheap and serve in big portions. This is the place right here!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is really bad. The lady behind the counter wears gloves but uses the same gloves when she is cleaning or picking up garbage off the floor and handling food. I watched her as she picked up garbage off the floor and then went around the counter and touched my fries with the same gloves. Not only that but once my sandwich was ready she just left it on the counter and she started doing other things. Someone else must have finally asked her about the sandwich and I see her pointing to us so as to tell her who it's for. The girl comes and give me the sandwich and I tell her what I witnessed and she just says I'll tell her. No apology or nothing.  If you don't mind risking it and getting sick this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing quality Cuban Food for 5$ in Vegas. It is an excellent place and the flavor is really Cuban (I am Cuban and know what I am talking about). Highly recommended both for take out and on spot, although place is designed for a quick, very informal eating session. Staff is great!!!

Other than at home (and u need to know how to cook Cuban eve there) you do not see this in Vegas, or even the US."}
{"text":"I used to go often but No More. What you
get nowadays is a heaping amount of
white rice (a very cheap and fattening
staple) and meager portions of the
main item and 2 sides. Unless you
happen to live within 3 miles of the
place it is no longer worth the effort
or gasoline cost to get there UNLESS
you love to fill up on White Rice. The
place is OK but IMO nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:00 a.m. Monday morning very excited to try good Cuban food only to be told there was none. No food no bread nothing until 11:00 a.m. Very disappointed. Why is restaurant open at 9 if there is nothing to serve til 11?"}
{"text":"This is most definitely one of my favorite places to eat. Carlos and Betty have always welcomed me with the hospitality that only family greets you with. Their food is amazing and their interaction with their customers always guarantees a good time with good people. I've read some reviews about their rice and beans and their meats. Barry, at the end of the day, your opinion is just that. However, it does not make your opinion fact. Their Lech√≥n is off the chain, their Ropa Vieja has great seasoning, and their yuca is wonderful! No, I am boy getting paid to advertise, and I am not even family. I just get treated like family every time I go."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall \"cafeteria\". Even at twice the price it's worth your while. Remember, it is cash only. I do wish they had free drink refills, but maybe I'm being greedy."}
{"text":"Called them to find out today's special and I got a RUDE response. When I got there I saw them carry the food (pork leg)  UNCOVERED from the car to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Authentic food! Reminded me of my grandmas food! Brought back memories! The service is fast and friendly. They adjust the language and speak English if needed. Very clean and family friendly"}
{"text":"Popped in after driving by and seeing that a new restaurant had settled into this space! Count me in for Cuban food! This spot is cafeteria-style, with several dishes to choose from, super-low prices, and patio seating. Note that they are also cash only, so come prepared.

A $5 plate will get you a huge portion of food, with rice and beans, a protein, and a side. The grilled chicken was amazing, super juicy with a flavorful skin. I added on a papa rellena (potato ball) to my order and it was unfortunately underwhelming, but the meal itself was solid and more than enough for dinner. Looking forward to coming back, hopefully they'll have empanadas next time!"}
{"text":"I was drawn in by intrigue and will come back based on convenience,  price and quality.  Here's the deal with this place: 

Its a flat $5 per plate.  You choose a carb (rice,  or rice with beans) a meat (rotating menu) and a \"veggie\" (yucca, bananas etc). 

You get a full serving of each and it's plenty to fill up on.  They don't have a menu because the daily offering changes every time.   They also have empanadas for $1 and a variety of pastries. You really can't beat the price.  And the food was delicious and from what I know it was authentic (I've never been to Cuba). 

They were super friendly and answered all of my questions, as I'm fairly new to Cuban cuisine and I don't speak Spanish. I got my order to go and it hit the spot!! Perfect meal after a long night of drinking haha."}
{"text":"Lots of tasty food for a great price. They don't have a posted menu because the offerings change daily; and there are no signs telling you what the food on the line is. This could be difficult if you're not familiar with Cuban food, but it's worth the adventure! Cash only."}
{"text":"Arrived around 9:30am because we were in the mood to try a breakfast sandwich and some authentic cuban coffee. We've never dined here before and figured we would check the place out. Unfortunately no breakfast sandwiches with eggs so the lady recommended cuban sandwiches which we went ahead and ordered. Cafe con leche yesss delicious. A bit sweeter than I normally would drink but still good. The sandwiches were delicious, the pork was well seasoned and no fatty pieces which I appreciated!  My only wish was that they had more bocaditos available, the croquettas and pastellios came out as we were finished and walking out closer to 1045am. My advice would be to come later in the day so that you have more of a variety available. I will definitely be back to try those as well as their platos typicos.  But front what I could tell during this first visit the food was flavorful. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Location is small but service and food are fantastic! Great prices! Most meals are five dollars. Cuban sandwiches are five dollars and come with a large order of fries. Authentic Cuban cuisine.  Beans, seasoned fried pork and Cuban sandwiches are authentic and delicious! Limited seating inside and out, but perfect for takeout. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely FIRRRRE! Cash only but each plate is only $5.41 with tax and is pretty much 2 meals in 1. A new staple in my weekly diet. Rice cooked to perfection, the carnitas are flavorful & juicy, and the plantains were cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I love it! I cant wait to go back. They have great food and friendly staff. You can't beat the price.  It's a must try. Remember to bring cash and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"\"I wish I could throw up so I could eat lunch again.\" 

Honestly, after sharing my husband's comments on Carlito's as we walked to his car, need I say more?

Okay, fine... 

We walked in around noon today for lunch. I'm not very familiar with this side of town. I'm sure that had something to do with the challenge in finding it. However, for anyone equally or less familiar, if you head north on Maryland Parkway, turn right on Karen and left into the strip mall, the restaurant will be to your right. That said, parking was easy once we found where we were going. 

The venue itself is tiny. Two two-tops outside, maybe four four-tops inside, and a little bit of counter seating in the back. Inside, you'll find black & white photos of classic cards, a large wooden Cuba island art piece, a photo of Celia Cruz, raggaeton on the speakers, and the clamoring of Cuban-accented Spanish in the air. My husband called this the most Cuban place outside of Florida he's ever been. Clearly, we haven't been to Cuba. 

The entire process is cafeteria/Panda Express/filipino turo-turo-style, with a few a la carte options posted on the menu that really aren't visible until you're about to pay. When you approach the line, you'll find dessert options first (I love them for this). I don't think you order the dessert at this time. Rather, you have a chance to see the items and can order them when you pay. I could be wrong though. Moving on, you'll start by announcing \"for here\" or \"to go\". 

PRO TIP: Even if you plan to dine in, ask for your food to go. My husband and I had enough rice and sides left over that we ate them as our sides with dinner. 

Anyway, you'll choose your side. Assuming the choices don't change, you'l choose from congris (black beans cooked into rice), yellow rice, or white rice with beans. Whatever you choose will be generously poured in the main compartment of a three-segment box. Next, you'll choose your entree. Today, we had a choice of lechon, fried pork chunks, roasted chicken, or fried tilapia. I assume these rotate. Finally, you'll choose your side from tostones (flattened, fried, unripened plantain), maduros (caramelized over ripened plantain), or yucca con mojo. I also saw a tamale, but I don't think that was an option as it is available a la carte. 

I chose the yellow rice, lechon, and tostones. Let me just say that this is the best Cuban lechon I've had in Las Vegas. I say this because lechon can often be dry if you don't get your meat from the glorious juicy areas of the pig. This lechon was juicy and savory as can be. I have an appreciation for onions (*waves weirdo flag*). Some places will undercook the onion (leaving a raw aftertaste). Others will cook them to the point of caramelizing them (masking the pork flavor). The onions in this lechon were perfect; translucent, savory, and tender with an added tartness from the mojo). The rice was fluffy and soft. And then the tostones. You know when you fry something so well that it's almost delicate? Yeah. That. These were perfect. 

Service was fast. We were in an out within half an hour. 

OH AND HERE'S THE KICKER - we both got full meals and 1 can of soda each. Our total came to $12.99. You are not out of your mind! You read that right. $12.99!

Some things to keep in mind:
- CASH ONLY (not that you'll need much)
- Most of the guests in line will be ordering in Spanish. If that makes you hesitant to visit, just know you can point and pick. Also, there are employees who speak English... 
- There is no fountain soda (bummer), but they don't only offer Pepsi (#teamcoke #notthatcoke)
- This is not going to be a place where you'd take anyone with dietary needs other than \"carnivorous\" or \"pork lover\". 
- Other items for order included croquetas and tamales. The press in the back suggested there may also be sandwiches."}
{"text":"Comida excelente! El servicio espectacular!! Mis chicas favoritas son Maria, la rubia de la caja y paty la flaquita. Muy atentas y profesionales. Highly recommend guys!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the 95 & Decatur location. Yes it's cash only. But the Cuban Sandwiches and French fries were amazing!! We saw they do $5 plates. Next time we go we are both going to grab one each to try out a bunch of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you that this place is AWESOME....For the people that know about Cuban food you know it has to be authentic and NO in between.....Besides the CASH ONLY sign..This place is small cramped but it's perfect!!!!! The food is delicious and cheap!!! For $5 I took home some rice beans Pork chunks and plantains....The smell of the food when you walk in is amazing!!! The girls that work there are so nice and attentive....There is a few Cuban restaurants in Vegas but they have all turned Into expensive fine dining but this place gives you an affordable cuisine in the Barrio....I wish you guys the best and I will continue to spend my money with you guys...Eddie..."}
{"text":"Todo muy rico, muy buen precio y gran variedad de comida, excelente servicio. Me encanta su Fricas√© de puerco o res y su arroz frito...riqu√≠simo!!!
Carlitos y su se√±ora esposa siempre atentos y su personal muy servicial!
Gracias por ofrecer comida rica y a muy buen precio"}
{"text":"I think I remember a Dairy Queen in this building some years ago, followed by a series of businesses that never made it. I'm hoping Carlito's sticks around because they serve tasty Cuban food at a great value. They don't accept credit cards, so bring cash.

It's cafeteria-style and a great alternative to fast food when you're short on time and looking to spend around $5 on lunch. The patio seating out front had a good crowd at lunch time. I didn't see any written menu available, so I just selected from the prepared options on display. When it comes to Cuban food, I really only eat black beans, white rice, fried plantains, and guava pastries. They have the traditional espresso machine behind the counter, so I'll be back for some sweet Cuban coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing food for $5 dollars. I have never found a Cuban spot of here that was worth trying.

This place is more of a cafeteria style. I absolutely love this place. Food is nice and hot and good !! Service is fast so you can get in and get out"}
{"text":"This used to be a Dairy Queen shop and I noticed it the other day and it said Carlito's Cuban food. Well, I lived in Miami for 12 years and I found great Cuban food today. Carlito's has an excellent selection of food, authentic and delicious.  At the moment I'm eating a Cuban sandwich, which I haven't had a good one and over say 30 years. I'll definitely be visiting this place again. They have croquettes, empanadas, plantains, beef dishes, pork dishes, chicken dishes, black beans and rice and quite a number of homemade deserts. All authentically Cuban.  The prices are so reasonable you'll be here every night.  There is no menu.  The food is in large serving dishes which you pick your dinner from.  While I was there they brought fresh food out constantly.  If I could they'd get SIX STARS."}
{"text":"My Wife took me here ... outstanding food very fresh very clean friendly service very big portions of food  I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food is great!! Authentic Cuban food in Las Vegas!! $5 combo plate is a huge portion of food! Desserts are great! Can't beat it honestly!"}
{"text":"All the way good, everything is outstanding and the service is amazing! It is impossible to find cuban food in this town and good cuban food was unheard of until this place opened
Do yourself a favor and try the bread pudding!!"}
{"text":"Food is great!! Authentic Cuban food for $5!!
combo plate is a huge portion of food! 
Empanadas are my favorite. Employees are really nice ."}
{"text":"The best Cuban food in Vegas so far!! The place its not fancy are all but the food worth it!!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Cuban food so I feel hesitant to give them such a mediocre score, but regardless I think there's a lot of things they can improve on.

First, the options are too limited. I don't know if Carlitos is planning to add more variations and choices but when I was there it was very limited: two choices of rice, two choices of meats, two veggie choices and desserts.

Secondly, the food itself did not taste very fresh. I went in here thinking it would be more restaurant style but it's set up buffet style, with the food pre-made and sitting in steamers. This is usually OK but sometimes the food doesn't taste 100% fresh, which was the issue here.

Lastly, no cards, cash only. Again, maybe because this place is new they don't have a proper POS system installed yet, but I hardly ever carry cash. I happened to have a few bucks in my car so I was lucky.

I really wanted to like this place. I remember having some of the best Cuban food ever when I was in Miami last spring so I came here expecting the same thing. I was disappointed they didn't have Cuban sandwiches or much of anything at all, but perhaps because it's new. I asked the workers a few questions but it didn't help that none of them could communicate with me."}
{"text":"One word. Authentic! My husband is Puerto Rican and have a similar background to Cuban food and this place was so good seriously coming back for more. They have all the classics that you would want. Cheap and reasonable!"}
{"text":"$5 for a huge plate of food. They have different things to choose from everyday which is cool. Love their plantains. Love their chicken stew"}
{"text":"The only cuban food I know of is Porto's from California so that's hard to compare too!! But the food here was still good especially for the price, I was a little skeptical when I walked in bcuz it's sooo small inside and there's no menu but we still stayed and tried it, I can honestly say it'll be one of those small go-to-fast local places to go to for lunch!! So It's $5 for your choice of Cuban rice, beans, and meat and or fried bananas, plantains or yucca. The 2 times I've been there they have had different selections of meat so I guess they probably switch them up daily or maybe weekly"}
{"text":"It's affordable Cuban comfort food! $5 for a meat of choice and two sides! Food is homey and good but nothing special. Tostones were too salty and dry, more like chips. Beef Emapanada $1.00 was good but greasy. They didn't have the pork chunks I was craving today. It would be hard to come here on a craving because they change the menu all the time so you just have to come and see what they have. The shredded pork was okay. Seating is limited and it's hot in there with a/c and fans on because the kitchen is open and so close. Not sure if I will be back...there are better places closer to me. You get what you pay for, cheap food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food the staff is super friendly and you cannot beat the value.  Keep up the great food and the service.  A great selection and the soft drinks are typical Cuban style try the \"Ironbeer\" great soda. Being of Cuban American descent it's great to have you guys in Las Vegas.  Orgullo Cubano!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic food and experience for Cuban food ever. Simply amazing. I love it. I go all the time even though I am a non meat eater there is plenty of food I can eat. They all also speak Spanish and me, well not so much, I try and they understand I am trying and work with me for my trys!
Such an amazing spot, but make sure you go in with cash because they don't take card! But that is no deal break- the food is extremely cheap and literally to die for. This may sound crazy but I could dream in the food. Amazing food and experience for a low cost-everyone wins."}
{"text":"The food is okay, BE WARNED IF YOU GO TO THE ONE ON MARYLAND THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. They used to give a good amount of meat. Now I guess since they have more customers. They go way too cheap on their serving portions.They used to give plenty of meat. Now they only give your 1 small bistec A BUNCH OF RICE and 2 or sometimes 3 if you get lucky sweet plaintain. They can charge more for food but COMON GIVE MORE MEAT YOU CHEAP BASTARDS."}
{"text":"My hubby is Cuban and very picky about his food. This place is legit delicious and portions are perfect. So far everything we have eaten is well seasoned and cooked. Can't beat the price $5 for a meal. Some food is cold others are made to order.  Very welcoming environment. Would c9nti us to dine here!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Cuban food at a very good price. Got food for three people with $20, including sodas. My favorites there are the yellow rice with ropa vieja or the Cuban sandwich (comes with french fries). The food is seasoned so well, and the pork and beef dishes I've tried so far are cooked perfectly. Meat was very tasty, juicy and tender. The place is very clean and the staff are very friendly and welcoming; the owner even recognized my mom and came over to say hi. 

This place came highly recommended and I can definitely see why! Very much worth the drive. I was told there is another location on Decatur that's closer, so I'm planning on checking it out soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. I loved the food, it's the best Cuban food I've had here in Vegas. The food is authentic and has the same taste as meal prepared in Cuba does. The food is not only good but cheap."}
{"text":"So if you like Cuban sandwiches this is the spot to go to. I drove by Carlitos the other morning and stopped for some Cuban coffee which was sooo good in the morning it hit the spot. Then I decided to eat a Cuban sandwich with frys, the prices are really fair the sandwich fries coffee and a coconut water drink came to about $7.00  The other foods are set up like Chipotle style where the foods already made and you just tell them what you want on your plate. I think they start out at about 5 bucks for a plate of food which is pretty cheap for lunch. I definitely will be back for another one of those Cuban sandwiches and coffee it was delicious."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Great flavor and options. Friendly service and fast ... a new regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"I love your food, but let's be real... Your staff is rude as f***. If looks could kill from eye rolls from the girls serving on the line, I'd be dead before I paid for my food."}
{"text":"Tried to order not only did they not understand any English, but even when using their own menu name's they looked confused. Then they just tried helping the people behind us without confirming our order. After all that they tell us the sandwiches will take 20 mins. Told them fine just make them all Cuban and they once again proceeded to try to get the people behind us to pay, again without confirming anything with us. Walked out without even getting food the whole ordeal was ridiculous. Not even gonna bother coming back here."}
{"text":"Al comienzo todo bien, pero ahora la comida a veces est√° salada, y est√°n echando menos cantidad.Al principio era mi restaurante preferido pero ahora  crea fama y acu√©state a dormir"}
{"text":"WOW. DELICIOUS.

I came here during lunch and got take away in no time. So the deal here is you get to pick 3 items for $5. I got the pork, bananas and black beans with rice. All were very flavorful! They had lots to choose from including empanadas and cookies. 

It was my first time here and everyone was so nice, the staff and customers! They do speak English so don't be intemediated."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Cuban food I've ever had ! I've been coming here since they had the smaller location next door and the quality of food is super consistent I eat here about 2 or 3 times a week! You have to try the pl√°tano maduro it's amazing the black beans are the bomb always ! If you're ever on the east side you must stop here for lunch or dinner it's very inexpensive and they give you enough food to eat off of for 2 days yeeeee"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed!   First I got there about two hours after it opened, was informed that all they had was \"Meat and Rice\". Ok that was ok when trying to pay, I was told that they didn't take \"Cash\".  Ok went over to the ATM machine.  Was charged a $1.50 fee plus a $2.50 foreign fee.  What the HELL is that."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for lunch and she ended up choking on a piece of wire in the pork!!"}
{"text":"Moving from LA last year I was in need for some yummy Cuban food....drove 20 miles EACH way to Carlitos and I was not disappointed!! Prices are absolutely amazing, food delicious and big servings, restaurant very clean and staff nice. I'll be going again soon!"}
{"text":"La comida no me gusto,apenas sabor,los frijoles aguados,creo que hasta vieja porque lo poco q com√≠ me callo bastante mal y muy mal trato"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Cuban food. The pork was tasty and the beans and rice was cooked perfect. I'll be coming back to try some of the other dishes they have."}
{"text":"Wowza!!  Went off the recommendation of the wifey's work friend that this is the place for some stellar Cuban food!  Boy was she right!

Got $5?  Seriously, find some of that change between your car seats, that's all you need!  $5 and change for some great, stick to your ribs kinda food!  Carlitos Cuban Food is no frill, but it ain't no joke either!  Tasty!

Came on a Saturday early afternoon for lunch.  Place was hoppin' busy!  Line was out the door for us, parking was a bit of a squeeze too.  But it was worth it!  $5 will get you fed WELL - get a takeout box with rice & beans, or rice & beans already mixed together, choice of a main protein, and an additional side!  Trust me, the portions are great, lots of food!

Choices for proteins and side vary by day according to what the chefs find at the market that morning.  That day I got lucky, gots me some slurpin' good simmered OXTAIL!  Got a side of fried yucca to go with it as well.  So yummy and sticky delicious!  I don't know what kind of spices they simmer the oxtail with, but it was flavorful, nice profile, and a tiny bit of heat!  Delicious with the rice & black beans!!  Then sop all that tasty juice up with some fried yucca!  This totally made me comfortable in the belly.

As if that wasn't enough - I gave in and got the Cubano sandwich - AGAIN, only $5!!  Comes in a combo with hot fries.  Dude!!  Girl at the counter said it's probably the best Cubano in Vegas.  Can't say she is wrong!  Such a simple looking sandwich - but layered with so many flavors and cooked to perfection!  You gotta eat this Cubano fresh off the grill, the bread they use is lightly crunchy but still got heft, the store-bought deli ham (yes it's probably key), the Swiss cheese, the pickles, mustard, all topped off with a heap of shredded pork - HOLY COW!  Umami town for sure!  It is such a great sandwich!  I'd come back a few times a week for this value of a Cubano - Subway footlong be damned!!

Yep, I'll be returning to Carlitos Cuban Food whenever I can, and that's probably often - because I only work 10 minutes away!!

Just one note here - it's a CASH ONLY business.  So bring your change, for real!!"}

{"text":"Authentic Cuban Food $5, Five Stars. 

A six word review in honor of Cuba's favorite adopted-son, Ernest Hemingway. 

This small kitchen offers some great Cuban favorites for $5. The combo comes with a starch, a protein, and a side, each with about a half-dozen options. You walk down the line and your choice for each selection gets lovingly heaped into a styrofoam container, a very similar process to a chipotle/subway.

I had the rice mixed with black beans, which was piled high to fill one-half of a styrofoam to-go container, the ground beef with veggies and olives, and fried sweet plantains, or platanos. 

All the dishes were fresh and delicious. I topped it off with a $2.50 Iron Beer Soda. What a treat! The flavor is akin to pepsi mixed with orange soda and maraschino cherry. 

I will definitely be back. Great place for authentic, cheap eats.

Be aware that it is cash only! 
Also, inside seating is limited, but there are more tables on the front patio. 
Make sure to grab some of the hot sauce to spice things up!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Cuban food through home cooked dishes from cuban friends, so finding that quality in a fast food environment is not a reasonable expectation. That being said this place does not do justice to the true flavors and aromas of cuban cuisine. The Congri (rice & beans) was bland and lacked its typical cumin flavor, the fried fish (probably Tilapia) had a strong \"fishy\" taste, the fried chicken, fried yuca and fried plantain were ok. Servings are huge here, and the whole meal (rice, 1 meat and 1 side) is only $5, enough to feed two people! They don't accept cards, so have your cash ready, or pay the $3 fee at the ATM onsite."}
{"text":"My first experience was so bad the food was cold tasteless and most certainly over cooked.I was so umimpressed I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best little Cuban place I've been to in a long time. Very authentic. Definitely has some of my all time favorites. I always make sure to order extra for later!"}
{"text":"This was a fast food Cuban place.  There was a $5 plate that came with assortment of Cuban items.  The food was good and well prepared.  Not the best but for the price, it's worth it."}
{"text":"5.00 lunch or dinner, solid Cuban food.  Yes, its limited choice, and cafeteria style, but so what. Everything tastes good, the employees are friendly, been there several times, and not  disappointed.  Cuban coffee, excellent.  Please get a better selection of deserts and empanadas."}
{"text":"Can anybody explain me why trash bags inside the food containers from where they serve the food. It's just disgusting and not safe, plastic melts with the hot temperature to maintain the food warm and it could cause serious health problem such CANCER."}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic and tasty Cuban food in Vegas. You walk in and you chose two sides(yuka, rice etc) and the meat that they are serving that day. I had the con carne with black rice and yuka and I added fried bananas for a small additional charge. Very tasty and hearty and everyone there was very friendly. Look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Love the food and excellent pricing! Good space and nice ambience. Need more places like this"}
{"text":"Good and cheap Cuban food. they charge $5 per plate. You can't eat Cuban food for  $5 in Las Vegas. The only thing is you don't know what they'll have each day since the menu is not updated on Facebook. Sometimes the food is a little salty but other times it's good just like my mother in law cooking."}
{"text":"I wanted to get some good authentic Cuban food without having to pay $20+ per person. I ended up finding Carlitos and I will admit I was little skeptical. I saw it had great reviews online so I gave it a try. There's no prices anywhere but the food was so cheap and most importantly cheap. I got a plate of food that I barely finished for only $5.50!!! You don't find deals like that anymore honestly. 10/10 my new favorite place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great authentic Cuban food at an excellent price. You get a huge portion of food and you will not leave disappointed. They have two locations in Vegas. I have gotten the pork and the shrimp and they were both really good. The rice and beans together was such a large portion my kids even enjoyed eating there."}
{"text":"You just can't beat the price! Each order is loaded with food and the food is loaded with flavor. That's a winning combination! The only thing that makes ordering difficult is the language barrier if you don't speak Spanish. There is no menu to order your meal from, so you have to go in knowing roughly what you want and what it actually looks like. If you're not used to Cuban Food, ask someone in line for a recommendation or bring along a friend who's in the know. My rec: Ropa Vieja with black beans and rice and either plantains (sweet & soft) or tostones (salty & crispy). Mix that all together and enjoy. Insanely good!!"}
{"text":"So delicious. If you don't speak Spanish you probably won't understand what they're saying or even what you're eating but it's totally worth it! Everything is delicious served up cafeteria style. Definitely try the Cuban sandwich it is to die for and it's served with crispy delicious French fries on the side. A plate is 5 bucks and some change and they give you a ton of food! Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"The combination food plates are an excellent deal. On the day we tried them for lunch (take-out), the line was out the door, so word must be getting around. The place is small, so seating is limited, but the place is clean and staff was good about keeping the line moving. We ordered four platters and favorites included the delicious fried pork chunks, congri and maduros. Our daughter loved her tamales. Because the food is kept in steamer pans, items like the tostones and fried yuca did not fare well (too soggy). And it would have been nicer to have more variety in the meat offerings, but I understand that the menu rotates. On our day, three of the four meat choices were pork (shredded pork, pork chunk, stewed pork plus fried fish). Otherwise, no complaints. This former Miami gal is happy to have another good Cuban place in town and looks forward to trying Carlito's again."}
{"text":"Cuban restaurants on the west side of town have not fared well, so I'm hoping that this newly opened, second location of Carlitos Cuban Food bucks the trend. We are so excited to have one within 15 minutes driving distance of Summerlin, conveniently off the I-95 and Decatur exit. Food at Carlitos is served cafeteria-style, and the menu changes daily. Seating is limited, so take-out is best. For only $5, you get a generous platter of Cuban country cooking with the choice of one main entree (usually four are featured), white rice/beans or congri plus one side (ex: plantains, yuca). Additional items can include papas rellenas (stuffed potatoes), tamales, empananas and such for less than $2 each. There are also desserts and tropical drinks. We have sampled the masitas de puerco (pork chunks), ropa vieja (shredded beef), stews, picadillo and breaded fish....all delicious. So far the only weaknesses have been the arroz con leche (a very dry rice pudding) and croquetas de jamon (fried ham croquettes that tasted off). The place would also benefit from better signage so that those who are not familiar with Cuban food can know the food options. However, service is friendly and employees are good about answering questions.  And $5 for a meal made with fresh ingredients is an incredible deal! Note: This place is cash only."}
{"text":"The food is Cheap and Amazing!!!! So many different choices of meals to choose from and the staff is very nice. I'm definitely coming back and would recommend anyone to stop by and gives try it."}
{"text":"I recommend this spot to all my friends to try out. It's worth it and I'm sure they'll become repeated customers as I am. All I have to say is that if you haven't tried their food you're clearly missing out!!!"}
{"text":"Second time I have eaten here and I will say it again,  AWESOME!  The only authentic Cuban food I have ever eaten in Vegas and great prices!"}
{"text":"Greatest Cuban sandwich EVER. It's affordable and it tastes great. The closest authentic Cuban food you can get here in the valley. You should definitely try the Cuban sandwich. The papa rellanas are good too. Anything you choose, you can be certain that it'll taste great."}
{"text":"Best Cuban food in Vegas! I have no complaints. Cheap and absolutely amazing.  My fianc√© and I go at least once a month since it's far from our home. I even turned on my coworkers to im this place and they go, too!"}
{"text":"I go to Carlitos at least once a month to get authentic Cuban food. The foods really good not to mention reasonable. If your hungry and want to something good and have 7 8 bucks this is the best place to go."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something delicious, this place is not it.
Ignore all these dumb reviews about how good the food is.  
The food is just so-so, it's just ok.  No tastier than a plain hotdog or bag of chips.  This place is so ethnic, they don't even know what yelp is.

The place is really simple,  5 dollar plates. You pick a rice, a protein, and a starchy side.  The meats are chicken pork or beef.  The sides are Yuca or fried Yuca.  Sweet platano, or fried plantains.  I don't recommend anything but the plain white rice.  The rice and beans are over done and dry.  The white is made just right.

The meat: Its dry, fairly seasoned.  I don't think food deserves bonus stars just for being cheap.  I agree the portions are huge, but the food is super unhealthy as there is no veg whatsoever.

I do recommend this place when you're broke and wanna get a lot of food for cheap.  Or you're the boss of something and you're treating the staff.  It's literally 2 lbs of food for 5 bux.


Come here if you're just looking to get stuffed for cheap.
you've been warned."}
{"text":"Muy buena la comida. Pero el guarapo es una estafa. Es agua con az√∫car y s√∫per caro $5 lo mismo que un plato de comida. Una decepci√≥n"}
{"text":"La verdad por lo muy barato que me comentaron que era pens√© que la comida era lo peor y poca...! Pero sorpresa la m√≠a cuando llegue a este lugar y es una adicci√≥n no puedes dejar de ir de lo deliciosa que es y super accesible al bolsillo!!! Sigan as√≠! Y otra cosa uno se siente como si estuviera en casa :)"}
{"text":"Great little quaint place. Located right off the 95 on Decatur Blvd. 100% authentic Cuban food. My beautiful one is Cuban so I get the Cuban experience every day. Food is great I had a Cuban sandwich with fries. She had sauteed shrimp white rice and sweet plantains. If you are looking for a authentic Vegas hidden gem. I highly recommend this place. Price and service is great."}
{"text":"I love a good Cuban and they have realllllly good Cuban sandwiches. The prices are really good however the fact that they do not take card is really disappointing. I wanted to buy more food, but only took a $20 which was easily spent on 2 cubans, 2 cuban coffees, and a side of plantains, had they taken card, I would have spent a lot more. 

The cuban was really flavorful and crisp with the bread and smooshy (technical term) with the filling. It was lunch rush on a Saturday so a bit of a wait and I can say that it is worth it. I will come back during an odd hour and I really want to try their desserts, the display looked really appetizing. I wish I had taken pictures. 

The cuban coffee was ok, it needed to be a bit sweeter for my taste. The services was all right too. and the entrance is cramped. This location use to be an old DQ. I also wish the items had been labelled, not being familiar with cuban food entirely I can easily see myself spending a lot of time asking what each other items are on a one by one basis. That can be frustrating for both me and the person helping me."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Carlito's Cuban food.. they give you a lot for your money and the food is delicious most of it is pretty much as I remember tasting it in Cuba and I have been to Cuba quite a few times a few things changed because the ingredients here unfortunately are not as fresh as they can get them back home and Cuba but I'm absolutely happy with the food that they serve at this place I frequent it at least 2 or so times a week sometimes I go 3 times a week all my Cuban friends actually love this place for the price The Taste is absolutely great I Give It 2 Thumbs Up"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here so I feel bad for the three star because the food could be great.  Unfortunately, they don't speak English and we were unable to order because we had know idea what anything was other than \"pork\". The only word they said.  There's about six
People working and they lacked communication.   
We love good Cuban and always looking for some great food.  

My husband speaks Spanish and he still couldnt get the gist of what they were saying.  
I hope they do well, they'd do better if we knew what we were about to order."}
{"text":"Carlitos Cuban Food is amazing! The food is inexpensive and delicious, it tastes homemade and we love it! In my experience, you don't get the same quality and treatment from other places like florida caf√© or Havana grill. The employees are so nice and welcoming. The ropa vieja and platanos are my favorite :)"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good- not great, but the hot meal combo is only $5 -so the price point is good for decent food. More like 3.5 stars. Note- they have a new address- they are in the same shopping center (closer to the street) next to Thai BBQ. It is very informal and most employee's English is limited. The one that helped us spoke well enough so we were able to understand here. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious! Authentic cuban food! $5 completas which are one choice of the two rice, three meats and four side dishes. 
ONLY CASH!! Thankfully, the workers are patient with you so that you can go to the nearest bank and get cash.
I haven't tried any of their other offerings but, I bet they are just as good as the completas."}
{"text":"This was outstanding food and price. I will most definitely come back. The service was great the owners even came out and wanted to know how our meal was. We did what someone else suggested and had our food in the togo container as you will have enough leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"For the price this small Cuban Cafe is definitely worth a try.  I usually go with half chicken with balck beans & plantains for like $ 7.00 or something like that trust me it's probably best deal in town for what you receive. It's small place, has small sitting inside mostly outside patio area where more room is avaliable.  I would only recommend that they offer few more different items."}
{"text":"I have been to Carlito's twice now - within a week. Both times I have left wildly confused having only a basic idea of what I ordered and thinking to myself, \"What just happened?\" Luckily, I'm willing to eat just about anything twice. Both times I've eaten at Carlito's my stomach was in love and I found myself calculating my next visit.

This is a cafeteria style restaurant and ordering is odd - but just go with it. There are no signs, no labels. You walk to the food counter and start with your rice. Then you pick a meat. Then your side.

My first trip I ordered the white rice that is cooked with black beans, BBQ pork, and plantains. The rice was flavorful, the pork melted off the bone, and the plantains had perfectly caramelized edges. I also ordered two Papas Rellenas. It's the most popular type of croquette in Latin America and it's a delicious fried potato stuffed with ground beef. I was going to bring the second one home for my roommate. It was so good that I ate it too! The mashed potatoes were like butter.

My second trip I landed on the yellow rice (it has some sort of sausage too), pulled pork with onion, and yucca fries. I didn't care for this rice as much but it was still good. The pork was oh-so-salty but in a good way. The meat was fatty and packed with flavor and the onions perfectly caramelized. Don't get me started on the yucca fries. That crunch! That flavor!

The dishes are always changing and I have yet to try something I didn't like and I've tried a lot of things I've loved. I wish there was a lot more guidance on the ordering process and what is being served - but for now, I'll let it slide for another Papas Rellenas. 

Pro-Tip: It's cash only but they have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"I had one of their regular $5 meals and the rice was fantastic and the pork was pretty good.  I then tried their Cuban Sandwich with Fries which was also only $5.  I enjoyed the sandwich and you can't beat the convenience and price of this place."}
