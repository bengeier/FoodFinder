{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for all the NASCAR nonsense, and a little southern city experience.  We arbitrarily decided to stop in for dinner with our daughter (7 months). After walking in realized not really the place to bring your kids. Staff was great, and made it work anyway.  I have a habit of always ordering a Black and Bleu burger if it is offered on the menu (or anything that is nearly the same), making my own comparison to others I've had. This was straight up the best I've had. Perfectly Medium-Rare, crumbly bleu cheese, and all the right trimmings.  All in all, the staff didn't have to be as great as they were (really could have just sent us on our way), and I was expecting okay at best bar food."}
{"text":"Civilized, respectable locations don't charge separate covers for the gander and the goose.  Yes, it's that simple.    Well, Ri-Ra, I used to be a fan of your Irish authenticity, in terms of a cozy, low-key beer every now and then.  But seems you have taken a turn away from legitimacy, and towards masses of drunken revelrers.  A shame, really, for my once favorite bar in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Granted time is of the essence, but the Staff at RiRa handled our group of 19 on a thirsty Thursday evening with ease!  Don't let uptown parking scare you away from crashing this party, with the Discovery Place parking deck just blocks away RiRa is very accessible for those not living Uptown."}
{"text":"RiRas is an excellent place to bring old friends to shoot the shit, eat by yourself or even have a few round of beers with your co-workers.  It's an Irish pub that serves really good food.  The decor is not too upscale, but it's also not a po-dunk place that you would be ashamed of using as a meeting place for someone new.    I had the traditional English breakfast which had some really nice and authentic black & white pudding while J-Dubs had a burger that was bigger than her face and needed 3 hands to grapple.  Needless to say, there was so much food that we ended up taking it back.  The important thing was that it was tasty.  They have a fine assortment of adult beverages as well.    Also the poutine is quite authentic from what I've been told, and it was the first time that I was able to try this Quebecois dish.  The gravy was savory and the cheese was decadent.  Some sprouts on top added a splash of color and irony.   Our waiter Ray was a cool dude, fresh out of Ireland, he was able to entertain and regale us throughout the night with his stories and random old-world European knowledge of this little former English colony of North Carolina."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is a great nightlife spot with lots of energy and a solid beer selection.  Always busy, but rarely slammed, this bar has several different areas to suit different tastes. Downstairs is usually more subdued with its true Irish-pub feel. Upstairs is dark and slightly clubby. Both offer live music that usually cuts off at a certain hour to let a DJ play (top 40s and fun classics- seldom electronic or techno). The best part though, is the porch, which offers a beautiful view of three Uptown giants surrounding the bar- Bank of America tower, Hearst Tower, and the Fifth Thirds building. When the weather is nice and you've got to be outside, you can't beat it.  And a tip for a busy night- use the bathrooms outside, they're always vacant."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is one of my favorite uptown bars to go to. It has a very earthy and relaxed atmosphere, often with Celtic playing in the air. The seats are comfortable and the old wood work is quite pleasing to the eye. Some of the bartender ladies have a slight Celtic accent, which can just make your heart melt.  I have never eaten here, so I can't speak as the quality of the food. Though from the looks of it, they food is made rather well. What I can speak of is their excellent array of whiskeys. Several great aged scotches and bourbons to choose from and some great beers to partner with.  Ri Ra is a great place to have a nice relaxing drink of whiskey and taken in a football (soccer) game."}
{"text":"I had such a blast at this place!  I went here with my boyfriend and a visiting friend, and we had a nice time.  It's your typical beer selection, and the irish ambiance is also typical, but nice.    We came in on a Thursday night (and did not have a cover).  We found a table with only two chairs, and one of the servers was quick to drag another over for us.    I don't recall it being smoky, plus my friend is a smoker, and she was going outside to smoke, so its either non-smoking or she was just being nice to us non-smokers.   The band we heard was great!  Loved the music they played, from 80s to bluegrass, and in some cases, a mixture of the two!  It's really loud, so if you are with your friends and want to chat, it's a bit difficult for that.  Overall, a good time.  Good people, good music, and good beer."}
{"text":"Ri-Ra's is an Irish Pub and Restaurant that becomes a popular nightlife spot in Uptown Charlotte after dinner hours.  The food is good for the price level, and eating on the 2nd floor patio which looks onto the Hearst  plaza is a great experience during the warmer months.  At night Ri-Ra's has live music and a DJ which alternate floors depending on the night.  The bartenders are excellent, the atmosphere fun, and the drinks strong.  A great place to go to have a few drinks with drink specials every night of the week and a great place to grab a meal with specials depending on the time of day.  Cover for guys is $5 on the weekends, free for girls."}
{"text":"Went here during speed street for a drink with some friends so it was likely not a typical night, but we had a great time. The ambiance upstairs was great though the cover band was loud so we chose to sit outside. The balcony had a decent view and  it was a bit smoky but not too unbearable (and I'm the kind of guy who doesn't usually mind it).  Everyone I saw seemed to be having a good time, which is always a great sign, and if I lived in Charlotte I'm pretty certain I'd be here regularly."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Irish bar..very warm. And welcoming wait staff. I had the lamb stew and it was the most tender lamb I had in a long time . If I come to Charlotte again am back here."}
{"text":"Have been to Ri Ra's a few times. The food is good and they have an extensive list of beers on tap. The service leaves something to be desired especially at dinner but bartenders are friendly if you prefer to sit at the bar.  The half priced apps happy hour on weekdays is great."}
{"text":"Cute pub, good food-- crappy, inattentive service.. I truly am not impressed when a server takes my order yet refuses to write the order down.. esp when my order comes out all wrong. What does impress me is when a server actually does record my order, and everything comes out how I ordered it... Tonight I had a fairly simple order however I asked for salad dressing on the side.. Low and behold, my salad came out slathered with dressing. My boyfriend asked for sweet potato fries yet was delivered regular fries as a side. Aside from that, our server failed to ask if we wanted another round of drinks, yet when he finally did ask, our second order of drinks came out 10 minutes later. What truly was upsetting was that the bartenders were too preoccupied with the televised soccer game to help out the server. Crappy service = crappy tip and a crappy yelp review. Try again fellas."}
{"text":"I visited here last year and had the time of my life. Talked to one of the best waitresses in the world, Mairead. She's from Cork, as is my father's grandfather. (Yes, I was wearing a red shirt for Cork!)  If you have any appreciation for the Irish and our wonderful food, you owe it to yourself to visit."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there were 3 kids who were allowed to run around. The parents and  management seemed to be oblivious to the action of the kids. One of the waiters had stop so that he wouldn't drop the large platter of food!! The wait staff was not that great either!"}
{"text":"Love the beer.  Good service and wide beer selection.  Great place to meet after work for a few drinks to catch up with friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"We visited this pub on our first trip to Charlotte. The Guinness Stew and Potato Cakes were very tasty. Our server was friendly and fast. Our beers were never empty before we had a refill. Great place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of girls from work. Waitress was completely overwhelmed. She had too many tables and I didn't see a manager out helping her once. We ordered our food at 12:15 and asked where our food was 12:45. Didn't get our food until after 1. I had a meeting and told the waitress to nix my order. She came out with orders and dropped the tray as she was handing out food. 2 people didn't get their food and the other 4 had to get to go boxes. Food isn't good either. Changes need to be made. I have never had a good experience here."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so disrespectfully at an establishment. I have been to Ri Ras a couple times, each time the bar tenders were so rude. Despite people standing at the bar wanting drinks, they bartenders stood there and chatted ignoring everyone. When I finally got their attention, they acted like making a drink for me was outside of their job description. Even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were. Never going back."}
{"text":"The Whiskey Room atmosphere is wonderful. Ask for Ray or Adam; I got an education on Irish whiskey tonight and they won't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"I am so upset and disappointed.  We've been here several times and always enjoyed ourselves.  After our experience Friday night, we will never darken the doors of Ri-Ra again.  Our waiter got my husband's drink wrong.  He never came to see how were doing, to re-fill our drinks.  I had to flag the manager down to ask for mustard and ketchup for the burger.  The waiter can't use the excuse he was busy, because he checked on the table  behind ours FOUR TIMES while we never got any attention.  The couple next to us left because they never got waited on and looked really irritated, understandably!    How hard is it to mess up a cheeseburger?  That was one of the WORST burgers I've ever had.  No flavor.  Terrible.  When my husband tried to complain about the lack of service, the waiter got an attitude and was all defensive.  The manager didn't really seem to care.    You've lost a customer, Ri-Ra, and I think we deserved better."}
{"text":"Ordered food from brunch menu to find out after half an hour that they are not serving brunch. The reason the brunch menu is new and shouldn't have been out until next week. Well we had food from the same menu two months ago."}
{"text":"I went back to RiRa's for lunch today and sat on their rooftop terrace to enjoy the gorgeous weather.  I ordered the hummus wrap with the vegetable stack.  It was delicious!    They also had a breakfast/brunch menu.  My husband ordered an omlette with brisket.  He commented on the fresh eggs and cheese but said the brisket was the star of the show.  He was pleased that the brisket was mixed into the omlette not just folded over the ingredients.  The omlette came with potatoes and a thick cut of toast perfectly toasted.  I mean where else can you get brunch severed with such a great beer selection?!"}
{"text":"After a reservation snafu, which management promptly corrected, my wife and I had a great time at RiRa's.  They had some very creative small plate offerings, partnered together with some very solid traditional Irish fare.  There is certainly something here for everyone. The restaurant/pub has a lot of charm to it, and you can definitely tell the folks who run this place take great pride in caring for their customers and representing their heritage in the food they serve.  My wife and I real liked the fried Ruben sliders, the shepherds pie, and the potato and leak pancake chicken wrap.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the hooley kebab for dinner. It was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it. Huge portion. Tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it! It was trivia night so winning 50 bones certainly helped w that 5th star;)"}
{"text":"Aside from the sweet potato fries, the dubliner was awesome (I love lamb meat)"}
{"text":"Great food and great drinks, but avoid this place on the weekends. It changes from an Irish pub to a douchebag magnet club with ridiculously loud hip hop and Pop 40 music ."}
{"text":"Good Irish breakfast.  Even though this is chain, there are staff from Erin who are happy to serve you.  The Guinness is good and the craic is better when with friends.  Only complaint is that I think they deep fry the white and black pudding which is a no-no..."}
{"text":"I went here one morning in search of a proper fry-up.  It was okay.  The service was pretty good; but, the bangers could be a little better."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating there and I was a little disappointed about the service.   I ordered the soup of the day and was told it would be potato leek soup. The food came quick but no potato soup. Instead I got a chicken chilly soup and was told they had no potato soup. I would have liked him to tell me before instead of just bringing something else that I might not even like without even asking me if it was ok or if I would like to order something else.   The food was ok but the soup wasn't really an appropriate portion for its price after already getting something else than I expected.   The service itself wasn't to great either. We had a group of people and you would expect him to take everyone's order at the same time but everyone had to call him individually to place a food order which caused everyone to eat at a different time and in the end people still didn't get their food until we almost had to leave again."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome drink specials awesome wait staff 5 out of 5 place is incredible casual pub downstairs more upscale upstairs great bars giant patio love the place you always see a friendly manager who never fails to stop and check in with each table to make sure everything is perfect and if it isn't they absolutely make it right... Crazy good Guinness Sundae for dessert as well!!! Try it if you haven't!!"}
{"text":"Rí Rá is so great and so lackluster at the same time.  If it's late...if it's a weekend...prepare to pay a cover.  IMO, an Irish pub shouldn't be the type of place to attract crowds that pay cover charges.  This actually destroys any cred that I'd give to an Irish pub in the first place.  Disappointing!  The decor...the interior...the layout...pretty damn nice.  The bar and layout is exacty what I expect from a traditional Irish pub.  For a narrow layout anyhow.  The bar itself is about as authentic as you can get.  Very nice!  The atmosphere is nice when you're here early and bellied-up.  The patio is also nice for enjoying the evening.  Weekend nights...just say no!  The crowd is a grab-bag of disappointment.  Which leaves us with the food...it's food.  If it's late...and you paid the cover...and you're hungry...go ahead.  If you're not at Rí Rá, and you're hungry...there are many other fine options.  Try: Some Tullamore Dew neat  Avoid: Weekend nights"}
{"text":"Was visiting from Chicago and this place rivals any of the best Irish pubs out there. The ambiance is great, with the traditional wood paneling everywhere. Plenty of tvs for us to watch the games. We came in for a late brunch and it's was so delicious. My coffee came in it's own French press (which I will now buy for myself) and the breakfast sandwich had bangers, ham, cheese, bacon and egg on a toasted brioche bun. I made everyone at the table try it! If I ever happen to be in Charlotte again, I won't move from that bar. Haha better than epicenter!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after the theater for a pint, but could not get served. We sat down at one of the tables ( more or less stood by it because it needed cleaning) & waited for a server. One did walk by our table to grab the tip from the table behind us, then walked back by our table, but we were invisible. I then asked the bartender if we needed to place our order with her & take it back to the table, but she said servers were on the floor & they would take our order. So, we again waited & never did see a server. We gave up & went elsewhere for our nightcap."}
{"text":"One of my first experiences in uptown when I moved here...what a great Irish pub not to mention the food is out of this world...definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The bartenders will try to rip you off. Paid $6 for all tonic that was supposed to have gin in it. No alcohol at all. Happened to a friend in the same night as well. When he asked the bartender to make a real drink he had an attitude and did it reluctantly. About an hour later the same thing happened to me. All tonic, no gin. Waste of $6. Politely asked the bartender to make a new drink worth the price. The bartender rambled on about how it was too bad and the sale was final. He made $12 off of about $0.50 of tonic and no alcohol. Completely rude and unapologetic. Thinking they could take advantage of people who have been drinking already. Unless you feel like throwing away your money, there are much better bars that actually care about the customer experience."}
{"text":"The food is typically very good.  However, the menu was recently changed significantly reducing menu options including the elimination the best item on the menu - Guinness stew.    How does an Irish bar eliminate Guinness. Stew???  Know your customers, bring back the stew."}
{"text":"The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made."}
{"text":"Been here twice; both times it was an awful experience. In both cases, the trouble started with the hostess, continued through poor/nonexistent service. On this occasion, there was a cover for the privilege of listening to a lousy cover band playing tired seventies tunes in a room with terrible acoustics--apparently without a soundboard--and putting down money on overpriced drinks, surrounded by frat boys, guidos, and gold diggers in addition to the aforementioned problems. I'd write a more entertaining review, but honestly it's not worth the effort."}
{"text":"I went to Ri Ra a few weeks ago and had a great experience. I called ahead to make sure they were serving fish and chips that day (they only serve it if the catch of the day is up to their standards) and they were. The beer selection is really great-- we decided to get the trio of Irish beers featuring Harp, Swithwicks, and Guinness.  We started out with a half order of wings with a Jameson honey glaze. The wings were perfectly cooked and the glaze was really excellent. My boyfriend and I both ordered the fish and chips which were fresh and delicious with a crisp and delicious crust. Even though we were incredibly full, we saw the table next to us order a dish full of what looked like chocolate mousse and immediately told our waitress we wanted that for dessert. It was a Bailey's chocolate mousse with whipped cream on the top. It was a HUGE serving, perfect for sharing and definitely fulfilled our chocolate craving. In addition to the food, the atmosphere was really cool and the service was fantastic. Our waitress had a lot of great suggestions and seemed very knowledgeable of the menu.   I will be heading back to Ri Ra very soon to try some Guinness stew or a traditional Irish breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband for dinner once and the food was okay. I got a steak with some kind of whiskey sauce it was decent. The potato cakes were good.   As for the nightlife it's okay when it's not packed but once it's full it's hard to get around because the room is so small. Drinks are okay if you can get someone's attention at the bar, or even get to the bar in the first place.  Service is usually pretty good - when it's busy they're a little harder to get ahold of.   Last time I went for lunch my only complaint was they kept the door to the outside open and the sun was shining right in my face.   All in all it's ok, but not the best or most authentic Irish Pub I've been to. After all I am weighing it against Boston pubs..."}
{"text":"I came here alone on a Tuesday night and had the Shepherd's pie and Harpoon special which was $4 a glass. The beer was good and food delicious.   It was fairly cost effective for the area as well."}
{"text":"I honestly can say that I have found my lunch spot. I tried them out a couple of times and the sandwiches and wraps have been nothing but exceptionally delicious. They have so many different sandwich, wraps, and salad options. My favorite item on the menu so fast has got to be the honey mustard grilled chicken spinach wrap. I highly recommend this place for your lunch option. It also doesn't hurt that they are literally right next door to my work so I don't have to walk far."}
{"text":"I went to Ri Ra recently on a Friday night for a coworkers going away shindig.  I had a really good time.  I enjoyed the dark cave like old time bar aesthetic.  The had some diverse options on tap.  In the downstairs area there was some live acoustic guitar/singer.  Upstairs consisted of a DJ and lights - playing standard top hits.  There is a deck off the 2nd floor that was pretty popular the night I was there - a nice respite from the noise inside."}
{"text":"Your mom may or may not like this place. Bring a flash light! Guinness barbecue sauce was the shizzle. So were the wings. Wife ended up getting all banged up on some concoction of fireball and sparkling wine......pfffft, light weight."}
{"text":"Good dinner and lunch menu food.  I'd call it authentic Irish pub fare, but then again, I've yet to visit the Emerald Isle, so what the hell do I know?  Other food, namely from the little side sandwich area, is not so good.  The Ri Ra sandwich shop is convenient for most bankers who work uptown, but convenience is all it has going for it.  The sandwiches are overpriced, VERY slim on the stuffings (meat and cheese that is...they will give you all the shredded lettuce your little heart desires...yay).  And to top it off, their seemingly extensive chalkboard of sandwich fixings is paired down by about 50% on any given day, due to them being out of stuff.  Skip the sandwich shop and go to the upstairs balcony for lunch outdoors when it is nice.  You can get their sheperds pie (really good) for the price of one of their sandwich combos (really crappy).  Ho-Hum bar experience...during peak times, can get annoyingly hard to get a drink/have a conversation/breath downstairs, but you are in Uptown.  What do you expect?  It's somewhat better than the offerings of the Epicenter, but not by much."}
{"text":"My last visit to Ri-Ra was sub-par to say the least. We sat at the bar because we were just grabbing a quick lunch and it took forever to just get our order taken. We both had burgers and it seemed like they had to go kill the cow to get the meat because it took so long to get them out to us. My friend's burger was very undercooked and both of our fries were COLD. I would not suggest this place if you are looking for a good lunch!!"}
{"text":"Ri-Ra's is an Irish pup, not a stereotypical Chinese man saying \"We Lost\".  On weekend's they'll have a cover, but this is offset by the lack of a bathroom attendant, so the overhead expense for going out here is in line with the rest of downtown Charlotte.  The prices of drinks are probably a bit higher here, so you may wish to get a base going before you find yourself here.  The bartender was pretty nice to me.  I used an iPhone app with a drink database to order a random obscure cocktail and \"Irish Twist\".  She had no idea what it was but made it for me using the iPhone recipe, injecting some uniqueness into my Ri-Ra's experience.  And it may have just been the Irish Twists handling my perceptions, but I'm pretty sure she liked me."}
{"text":"Food- 4.25 Service- 1.00 We had a reservation for 12 for a casual business dinner. It was moderately busy-- a few open tables. It took 45 minutes to get our server to take our dinner order. It was very difficult to get our server's attention throughout the evening. We waited on drinks so long that we ended up re-ordering from the bartender. One person from the group re-ordered her drink twice and never received it. Really bad service, which is unfortunate because we really like to award good service!  The food, once it came, was excellent. Everyone was happy with their order- flavor, portions, offerings.  Sadly the service (or lack thereof) means we won't be bringing our big groups back here. It really seemed like the server was out of her element.   Update: a member of my party shared the experience with a manager and she adjusted the bill to compensate for the service. That earns an additional star from me."}
{"text":"food--- great    booze----great   service-- great  if you do not like this place , see a therapist."}
{"text":"This week's Excited about Eating is headed to Uptown Charlotte to visit Ri Ra Irish Pub. When we walked into this restaurant, it felt like we were walking into a pub in Ireland. Our server told us that the interior was transported from Ireland and restored into its existing condition.  We started with the Potato Cake appetizer, pan seared potato and cheddar cakes served with savory sour cream and a balsamic reduction. The Potato Cake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. On the downside, it was loaded with onions and only served lukewarm. Dora here, Good thing we didn't stop there. :)  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, made with minced lamb, gravy, peas, carrots, and leeks served with a mashed potato crust and a slice of brown bread. The term \"shepherd's pie\" is used when the meat is lamb; the theory being that shepherd is connected to sheep and not cattle. This was an outstanding dish. The lamb and vegetables were perfectly cooked and full of favor with just the right amount of liquid, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with a nice crust. Dora here, I'm always game for Shepherd's Pie, and this was the first I've tasted with lamb. Thankfully, hubby shared with me or I might've resorted to stealing his fork. Soooo good!   My wife chose the Ri Ra Burger, topped with Ashe County cheddar, country ham, brown sugar onions and a Brioche bun. This burger was tall, juicy, and almost too big for the mouth. The caramelized brown sugar onions were sweet, and the garlic mayo added a unique taste. The \"Chipper \" chips are actually thick cut fries. I snagged a few and enjoyed dipping them in the garlic mayo. Dora here, This was a messy burger, but oh so yummalicious! And I probably drank a gallon of their iced tea.  I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. If I included the less-than-thrilling appetizer, I'd lower my rating to 4 forks.  ~Ernie Hiers, Food blogger at Fiction Faith & Foodies"}
{"text":"Horrible service from the missing hostess to the unavailable server to the b*tch of a manager. Ordered a burger. Took 30 minutes to get it and then it came out wrong. No apology, no assistance. They wouldn't even leave me the fries to munch on. Worst pub experience I've EVER had!!! Went to enjoy the Euro, left completely disappointed and will not return. Contacting the home office of this chain..."}
{"text":"Great irish pub. Interior is great, looks like an authentic pub. They've got great food. Service is pretty good as well. Like most bars in Charlotte it's filled with smokers but that's par for the course in NC. Two levels, downstairs looks more the irish pub part. They typically have entertainment in some form either upstairs or down. Definitely worth a stop for a pint of Guinness!"}
{"text":"Here's a big hint: on Mondays, the burgers are half priced if you eat in!  They grind their meat in house so you can get them as rare as you like.  I strongly recommend getting the hand cut chips, they are light years better than the regular fries.  The burgers are huge, crumbly and messy, like a good hand made burger should be and they have a few different kinds, a friend had the lamb burger and said it was outstanding."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good brew, and a very low-key place.  Had lunch with some friends and family recently and I would really recommend the chicken pot pie.  It was very tasty.  The Irish lamb stew was also pretty good, but the Rueben sandwich was just average.  After a couple of pints of Guinness everything was alright with the world.  We would all go back because it was our kind of casual place."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from New Jersey with one of my friends. We walked in and waited to be sat. No one came or even looked at us. We decided to sit at the bar. The bartender looked at us walked away. I assumed he would come back after helping another person at the bar. After 10 minutes he never returned. In the mean time a waitress also saw us sitting there politely ignoring us still. Drink less food less. Needless to say the RI Ra in Atlantic City is way better. When I come back to Charlotte I won't be trying this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is a pretty good size Irish pub in the First Ward downtown Charlotte. I stopped in for a quick solo lunch and was surprised to see so many free tables. If Ri Ra was near my office in Chicago, it would be packed at lunch time.   The hostess and server were both extremely nice. The hostess told me that all the wood and furnishings were brought over from Ireland when Ri Ra was built. It's a pretty big place, 2 floors, with a large bar and lots of tables.   I was craving a burger but I had been told that I should have brisket while in Charlotte. Since I always do what I'm told, I went with the Wiltshire Patty, a delicious brisket sandwich. The brisket was very good, but the sweet potato tater tots were even better. Sweet potato tater tots. I'm now on a mission to find some of these in Chicago.   Friendly service and sweet potato tater tots, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The bar is attractive.  The beer is cold.  The fish and chips ranks right up there with Mrs. Paul's"}
{"text":"Yes, you have to pay a five dollar cover.  Yes, that's super lame.   The band was awesome and the bartenders were amiable and generous.  It was crowded, but I didn't have any problem getting service from the bar.  The smokiness definitely didn't bother me because I'm used to Mississippi bars which are much worse.  It seems like this is where the younger crowd hangs out.  I certainly enjoyed myself.  Ri Ra Rocks.    Apparently it's cool to wear a Christmas sweater too.  Do it."}
{"text":"It really doesn't matter if you are coming to eat, happy hour, meet up before going out or hitting this place late night Ri Ra is a great spot in Charlotte. Right down town and close to night life and the professional sector. I eat here often and I have yet to have a bad experience. Brunch here is amazing, as well as lunch and dinner. The bar tenders are really attentive and the drinks are well priced. Go here and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The inside bar is tastefully done and still holds strong to the Irish theme. The best spot for a quiet rooftop drink without a ton of people."}
{"text":"When I walked into this place I felt like I was walking into my dad's favorite bar in my hometown.  It was very casual and laid back, with the big wooden chairs and comfortable atmosphere.  The food was about the same as the bar back home too.   Good but not spectacular.  It tasted very fresh and well cooked, but pub food is rarely worth getting too excited about.  The waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  She really wanted us to have a good time."}
{"text":"I see a lot of people complaining about how smokey the place was, which is ironic because it burned down. It will reopen \"as soon as possible\", although they don't seem to be rushing it; the fire was in May 2009, and there is talk of a Reopening Party in the summer of 2010."}
{"text":"I've been to Ri Ra more times than I can count. It is a great place to go have a pint of Guinness with some friends and some pretty decent food if you are in the mood. The inside is very dim/dark lit and that added to all of the wood used everywhere to both decorate the bar, walls, tables makes it feel very much \"pub\" like.   While they do try and sell the traditional irish fair of Fish and Chips, Shepards pie and such I gotta admit that as much as I like this place the food could be a little better. It just feels like for the dollar amount you have to put forth (usually are 20$ a plate for dinner) you would be getting a little better quality. Also, the drafts of Guinness run at around $5.25 a piece so they are for sure running at premium price. Still though, despite its few shortcomings I would always recommend this place for a chill place to hang out and have some Guinness."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give a try to Rí Rá. Ambience was cool. We had a conversation without yelling!! We ordered fish and chips, and chicken tenders. Waiter was ok. They have different promotions for every day. Live music Fridays and I think Saturday. (From 10 pm)."}
{"text":"So a lucky trip to Charlotte allowed me to find this little joint.....and I'm glad that if did. Remember....Customer Service, Quality, Cost.   We were quickly greeted by a genuinely friendly hostess. I love people who are really happy to see you. Fake smiles.....well anyway....hostess was very nice and friendly. Sat quickly with a great view....the bar. The selection of beer and spirits is pretty good. Prices were fair for market location.   Our server, Lovely, was great. Yep that's her name. She Listened to us. Answered questions and was prompt. So great on customer service.   The food was excellent. I had the Irish Curry Chicken and the better half had Fish and chips. Portions were more than adequate. Taste was very nice with great flavors. We both had a few drinks and those were swell. So good on quality.   The prices were very reasonable for being downtown Charlotte. Very pleased. The whiskey list had some good choices with a few that I felt over priced, but that is my opinion.   So over all I give 4 stars. Would have been 5 but I didn't see anywhere that said it was kind of a sports bar. Soccer was on and a few patrons were overly excited causing a little more noise than I would like when dining. A little sign might help just prepare my brain. Otherwise great job.   BTW. We got a 10% discount for going to the Spectrum Center tonight to see Bruno. Bonus!!   Cheers! Or should I say Slainte!"}
{"text":"Super friendly Irish pub that KNOWS how to pour a Guiness. The place was jumping when I got there. They have a good happy hour, though I didnt eat there they seemed to have a very extensive menu and the guy next to me was eating something like a shepards pie. All in all I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our group was in Charlotte for a conference and came upon this bar. The first night, we drank our weight and had a great time. The atmosphere was typical for an Irish bar, and we found the staff friendly and amazingly quick for as busy as it was. Two nights later, we came back for dinner. The right of us all loved our meals. The shepard pie was especially good and the sweet potato tater tots with a side of Guinness bbq sauce was a hit with entire table. We will most likely be back here again this week."}
{"text":"Simply awsome!  Great atmosphere great people. Great food.  Highly recommended.  A true irish pub in charlotte"}
{"text":"My night started with being surrounded by a group of college women (I'm just itching to call it a \"scrunchie\", like one would refer to a *colony* of ants, a *pack* of coyotes, a *gaggle* of geese, or a *screetch* of hens -- Ok, so I made that last one up.  I dare you to spend three minutes waiting for a traffic light to change near these folks without seeing where I'm coming from.) discussing loudly just how \"ratchet\" they wanted to get.  (Seriously - first time I've heard the term used un-ironically. Ugh.)   My silent prayers were answered when none of the nearby spots they discussed plans to boot in the near future included Ri Ra.  Don't know, don't care where they wound up (bless the single [if that many] beating hearts among 'em. [Yeah, I meant it that way - this was one creepy belligerent Borg-like group of sisters]); but my visit to Ri Ra was a definite success. Service was fairly efficient, the food was fairly good (my main complaint is that sides weren't seasoned (even salt and pepper) and chips could have benefited from a few more minutes in the fryer.  But \"Authentic Irish fare\" - no.  Really, no.  Irish-ish, yes.  Definitely.  But  there are too many nods to American chain cuisine to merit equating this to what one would find in Ireland, having spent a few months there.  In the \"win\" column: drafts were good and well-served, though mostly not particularly Irish (not a complaint, just reinforcing that 'authentic' is not the best word to use to describe this place accurately.  Fair to good selection / variety.  And the setup is fairly good, even for nights when they're packed.  Fair mix of tables and bar seats & service, with a decent amount of floor-space for when they're busy.  The house ground burger was great - good mix of fat and lean, good grind size. The kitchen makes one hell of an egg.  And that's no small thing, especially in a pub / bar, which means the usual service hand-offs and oddness.  The malt vinegar mayo should be on the menu - it saved the otherwise fairly blah (undercooked) chips.  The fish and chips, though, falls on the other side of the ledger. Fries were blah, as above, and fish was unbelievably unseasoned, and overcooked.  No one likes chewy, fishy fish.  I was a little puzzled by the two glasses of white zin that were perched on the back of the bar for several of my visits (which each lasted several hours)...Odd."}
{"text":"I used to work at Ri Ra's and most of the time that generates a horrible review - however, I loved this place. The food was always good quality and kitchen staff was awesome.  The selection of import beer was good and the bartenders could make up some crazy concoctions. I always had a blast working on the weekends cuz the crowd was fun, the music good, and the tips = phenomenal! One hint: if you don't want to wait 30 minutes to get a drink from the bartender then snatch up a cocktail waitress and they'll get in bout 5 minutes. Allow time for them to fight the crowd to and from the bar and you'll have your drink in no time. And yes - a tip is appreciated.  Anyhow! A little history about that bar that I learned while working there: everything downstairs is imported from Ireland. The owners have a partner over there who does nothing but look for antique stuff for ambiance. Ask you server the next time you dine downstairs about some of the artifacts. It's actually pretty impressive.  Oh! And if you get a chance to dine outside on the patio take it! It's always comfortable and has a seperate restroom out there which is nice since there's not an abundance of restrooms."}
{"text":"Overall a decent a irish experience. The landscape is a little confused and varies night to night. Sometimes it's a fratty hang out, sometimes and emo rocker feel, at times casual dining, and sometimes (be it rare) a dance party.  the food is run of the mill. the drinks are solid.  BUT I do love the balcony with a great  ant's eye view of the city. Look straight up and see the best buildings in Charlotte and a great night sky."}
{"text":"From a bar perspective, it's kind of a 'bro down' similar to most bars in central uptown.  I can't speak to the food, but I've heard good things."}
{"text":"We decided to look around for something to do before or after a show at the Blumenthal, It can take forever to get out of the parking garage due to road construction.  Really liked Ri Ra. We were put upstairs, which was very comfortable and a little quieter than downstairs. I had a burger with egg which was great. My wife had salmon, which was also very good. Service was excellent from hostess and server Rachel. Timing was perfect (I cannot stand it when one person gets their food while another person at the table waits). We didn't feel rushed like at some places.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place large beer and liquor selection. Service leaves much to be desired and would avoid ordering the food. Fish and Chips at an Irish pub should be pretty standard but was one of the most flavorless things I have consumed"}
{"text":"Very quaint and authentic. The beer and dinner were excellent. We loved the atmosphere. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"If my friend hadn't noticed this place I would never have picked it out. He said \"Hey Look, it's an Irish Pub. And I looked at the name and thought I was looking at the wrong place. Have no idea what the name means. Perhaps it is Gaelic. Idk.   But the food.....I can talk about that. Our server appeared shortly after our arrival and took our drink order - Smithwicks for my friend and a perfectly balanced Dark and Stormy for me. Kudos to the bartender for crafting a great cocktail!   My friend ordered the Shepherds Pie and said it was solidly good and not amazing. 3.5 our of 5. For myself I had three small plates - a shaved Brussels Sprouts and Bacon dish that was very nice, Grilled Corn with Limed Butter and finally some Sweet Potato Fries.   All up it was a good meal that I would probably rate as 3.5 except that YELP still does not allow for that (Always hoping!). So I will err on the side of generosity and make that a 4. And I would add - definitely try this place....."}
{"text":"So I'm stuck here for work for a week and found this nice pub.  Not exactly my scene, but the wait staff was super friendly and suggested better spots for me to check out.  Beer selection was pretty typical and drink prices were pretty cheap (considering I live in NY)....Next time i'll try the food!"}
{"text":"The food looks great so I'd definitely try it again for lunch or dinner.  But it's a tiny space, even with the upstairs, so don't go on weekends if you don't like being mauled to death by overly tan twenty somethings in polo shirts."}
{"text":"Ri Ra's is right outside of my office ... so my colleagues and I frequent it a few times a month. Their burgers are delicious ... you can't go wrong with the 704, Hot & Smoky, or Guinness BBQ.  Huge burger ... and the side portion is huge too. I always get the onion rings .. one word: DYNAMITE.  A great place to come for lunch, or to come and catch a game on TV.  Very busy bar scene at night also, starting around 10:30/11"}
{"text":"I've never been here but heard many great things! We came for Moscow Mules and these are great! It's a great time to hang with friends and drink. I believe they also sell food, so I'll return to sample the cuisine...and have a few mules!"}
{"text":"Wow... I am so surprised that this place has been around as long as it has! This used to be one of my regular hang-out spots when I worked in Bank of America's flagship tower around 16 or 17 years ago. Back in those days, this was \"the place\" to go after work on weekends (and truth be told, many times during the week too, LOL!)   So, recently I was roaming around the area with Tim (who used to frequent Ri-Ra with me many years ago) so we decided to stop in and have a couple of beers and some appetizers for old time's sake.     Man, this place has not changed since we were last here! They even still have bartenders straight from Ireland working the bar, how cool is that?  LOL!   So, the only thing not cool on this visit was the fact that they had the patio closed.  They told us they only open it at certain hours at night... that bummed me out because I really wanted to enjoy my old usual drink (Harp's Lager) outdoors in the sunlight during this visit. Oh well... we still enjoyed the visit.   Even though there are tons of newer spots in the area, I'd probably stop in here again just for old time's sake. And if you have never been, its worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Good food and drinks. Live band upstairs on the weekends. However the bartender lost my credit card when I went to close it out only to call me the next day to say they found it. Too bad I had already closed my account. Maybe they should get a better system like swiping when you order vs. holding it?"}
{"text":"Feel bad giving a one star since we are friends of the bartender and regular customers of Ri-Ras, however we came tonight to visit with Adam and Ray who we come to see every other week we were welcomed with smiles and hugs from Adam who we had come to visit while we were celebrating my sisters 24th birthday night out, we were having a great time and really enjoying ourselves until we asked for the eagles to be played over the house sound system (as they are my sisters favorite band) the bartenders kindly went to the back office and got the eagles playing for us so we could dance and sing and enjoy ourselves until Debby downer the manager marched out from the back and turned the music way down and demanded to know form her staff who had turned the music up with a big grumpy face on her she marched off...the bartenders told us to take no notice and keep on singing, the next song came on and the vol went higher she marched out again and screamed who is messing with the f***ing music and glared at us in the process, she clearly wasn't happy about us trying to enjoy ourselves and made it awkward for everybody..The bartenders apologized and were extremely embarrassed, we closed out as she ruined our night out and left.. it was such a downer for us as we expected to be welcomed more from a Irish pub were we usually have the best time :("}
{"text":"a sports bar galore cold french fries make me so sad eighteen dollars gone"}
{"text":"I keep updating my review because I am so pleased with this place! It's my favorite in Charlotte. The food is beyond fresh and so good. Strawberry mojito is the best I have ever had. The most recent time I went I had the salmon and seriously that was the best salmon EVER. I am definitely their biggest fan :))"}
{"text":"Upon walking into the bar I was immediately taken aback by the beautiful craftsmanship of the woodwork in the building. The warm and inviting atmosphere makes you feel like you have been transported into Ireland. The quality of Irish Whiskey's and the variety of Irish beers completes the full transformation. Great location, traditional drinks, good place for a great time.   Arguably I only went there for a few drinks, but I had such a great experience I will definitely have to go back to try the food."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch March 19, 2015; they had recently updated their lunch menu. For pedestrian food it is WAY over priced, $12 for a basic hamburger and $14 for a Reuben sandwich. Might be a good place to drink but save your money regarding their food."}
{"text":"Had a few Irish Pub choices in the neighborhood and settled on RiRa.  It was a great choice.  Interior was what you expect in an Irish pub, women's world cup soccer on TV and a great fish and chips meal.  Plus, our waiter Ray is five months removed from Ireland bringing a real Irish flare.   Service was outstanding.   Would recommend highly for a casual night out on the town."}
{"text":"The following things make Ri Ra amazing, no arguments. Period. End of discussion.  1. McSorley's Dark, not only on draft but served in half pints as God intended.  2. Colman's mustard available on request. She brought malt vinegar for my fries, sorry \"chips\", without me having to ask. Together they are the end all, be all of chip eating.  3. Super tasty and generous food. I loved the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.  4. Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite scotch, so I say it gets a number.  5. Friendly and jovial staff. We made an open table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.  6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?  Ri Ra is a classy version of the Irish pub I love to feel at home in. Go check it out. It might just save your impression of Uptown."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is pretty decent Irish pub in Uptown: dark wood dining area, Catholic saints and Irish blessings abound, and hearty Irish-inspired dishes on the menu.  It's a great place to get lunch or dinner if you like the Irish pub experience, but don't attempt to get that experience on a weekend night.  You should be warned that the atmosphere changes drastically after the 9 o'clock hour.  The place gets packed on the weekends for the live music, with many young collegiates upstairs looking for potential mates and swarming in unbridled testosterone. Rira's has good cover and local bands, in which case they charge $5-$8 cover.  Don't get wrong, this can be fun in small doses.  Outside of these times, its usually a sedate, older white collar crowd that frequents this place.   Food wise-the burgers are always a good bet and the portions are quite generous.  I've had the sheperd's pie before, it definitely a \"stick to your ribs\" dinner.  Most entrees are in the $10-$20 range.  The bevvy selection is varied and lean towards British/Irish varieties. The staff are congenial, though hurried on every occasion I've been.  Rira's is a good bet among Uptown restaurants, but nothing that warrants a 5-star review."}
{"text":"Went here for a corporate dinner. Had the finger sandwiches (chicken, pulled pork, and something else), chips and spinach dip, lobster cakes, and potato cakes.   Only tried the pulled pork, which was good, but others said the chicken sandwich disappointed. Lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo.  Spinach dip the only saving grace. Oh, and their lemon bar dessert."}
{"text":"Here is my quick 2 second review -  Apps are great. Defiantly get the wings (mild and Jameson honey glaze) and the baked spinach dip.  Dinner was just okay - I had the kilcooly. The turkey was a bit dry, there was not much cheddar cheese on the sandwich and the sourdough bread was not that hearty - it kind of tasted like wonder bread. I think if they fixed those couple of little things, it would be outstanding!  Waitress was great! Very friendly and helpful. Went out of her way to make sure we were happy.  Would possibly go back - but just for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Not recommended.. at all  Ordered 2 Guinness and hummus as a appetizer.  She( the waitress)  brought Guinness stew and hummus?!?!? We corrected her and said 2 Guinness beers please. Not stew.  She brought out 1 Guinness. We shared the beer Inhailed the over priced hummus and got the hell out of there.. the 1/2 Guinness I drank was great! Hence the one star!! Shlante!!!"}
{"text":"Don't expect to be able to get food or drinks when there for Sunday soccer. I see one waitress for about 100+ people.  I have been there with less people and the same problem. Hour and a half and not once were we able to order food.  Left at halftime to go somewhere else.  Will not return.  If they chose to host the soccer watching things then they should actually hire staff."}
{"text":"Coco loco is now my favorite beer. Drank it while sitting on the rooftop eating the banger appetizer. Covered table with a great view. They had whiskey flights, but not beer. Oh well."}
{"text":"Can't rate the food but we had an excellent time at Ri Ra!  Great service behind the bar on a busy Friday night! Thanks to all!"}
{"text":"Definitely a spot for the nightlife crowd as I was not a fan of the food. Boyfriend and I split a sandwich, The Kilcooly. Our group was enjoying each others company while consuming a few tasty local beers but the food took over 45 minutes to come out. If you are an establishment this large you should be able to keep up with the demand. The sandwich itself was terrible, the turkey was dry and the cheese was overcooked. I took two bites and did not want anymore, the fries were okay but I wanted to eat those just to have food on my stomach.   Recommended for shaking your bum on the dance floor, not recommended for food."}
{"text":"I flew in late and wanted a good meal and a beer, so I came stopped here.  Dan, my waiter, was very friendly and responsive.  I got the pot pie and it was great.  The lamb made it.  I tried a local brew and an Irish beer.  Both were delicious.  I will come back next time."}
{"text":"Ive been here before in the past, i don't remember if i enjoyed it or not, but then again that should say everything. Came in on a Saturday night. Not many people in there. We didn't have reservations and was seated upstairs next to the bar of a great big group of people yelling throughout our entire dinner.Eh.  Server seemed not to knowledgeable of the menu as we ordered drinks. Waited a while for them just for him to come back 10 minutes later and say they ran out of the stuff to make my drink. Ok, ordered something else and waited some more.  We ordered the fried crawfish,it was great. I ordered the Ruben and it was big and juicy and everything you would hope a Ruben would be. The Brussel sprouts that i ordered with us was lacking some flavor.  Overall the experience was ok but defiantly forgettable."}
{"text":"I work in Hearst tower so we frequent ri ra for an after work drink. I've also gotten it as take out for lunch - the salmon salad was great. The roof patio is a great spot on a nice warm day!"}
{"text":"Wherever I travel it seems I always wind up inside of an Irish pub. Sometimes that is good, and sometimes it can be really bad. In this case, it is good, very good. Ri Rá is a very cozy pub adorned with field stone, vintage Irish signage, and dark wood setting a welcoming tone and making you feel as if you are back in the \"old country\".  I was also surprised to have a server that was from Ireland take our order, she was of course charming and accommodating, exactly what you would expect. My husband and I popped in to catch a rugby match and the atmosphere was fantastic. They have giant movie screen with surround sound and the place was filled with Irish fans, my husband was thrilled (I wish I could say the same for the outcome of the match!). We ordered a few Guinness, of course... Which were all fresh, tasty, and poured correctly.  My husband had the lamb sliders, with red onion, curried mayo and goat cheese. The mini burgers were deliciously unique and cooked to perfection.  I opted for a chopped salad that had everything you could want, grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, red onion. The salad was lightly dressed and with two rustic slices of brown soda bread and Kerry Gold butter, it was a very generous portion. Very tasty and bonus points for the butter.  Because we were watching the match I decided to finish off the meal with an Irish coffee.  Which can be risky... They actually serve it the correct way!  Coffee, Irish Whiskey (Powers was my choice), sugar and fresh cream. Simple, and delicious!  I will definitely be coming back now that the weather is changing to try some stew and of course another Irish coffee."}
{"text":"Had the shepherds pie. Nice presentation of the dish and ambiance of the pub was wonderful. The pie itself was a bit watery and I was given a fork to eat it with, waitress seemed rushed and a tad forgetful, also no refills ($5 for two glasses of Diet Coke lol). Met some friends here for lunch today. Many wonderful restaurants in Charlotte I would introduce our of town visitors prior to coming back here."}
{"text":"We ate at Ri Ra on 12/12 and really enjoyed it. It's always a guessing game when you pick a restaurant in a strange city. Even with reviews to check out, you never know what you might get. Ri Ra had good solid reviews, however, and was within walking distance of our hotel, which was a deciding factor!  It was fairly busy when we got there and there was a trivia round going, which was slightly annoying, since it echoed through the whole restaurant, but we were there early and once the game ended, it was much better.  We were impressed with the selection of import and local beers. I stuck with Smithwick's but my partner was a little more adventurous and tried several local NC beers, all of which were good.   We started with the hummus appeitzer, expecting the usual bowl of hummus and sliced pita. We were more than pleasantly surprised when what we got was the hummus, toasted pita, and a selection of roasted red peppers, olives, marinated artichokes, and cucumber and celery for dipping. The hummus itself was excellent, garlicky and spicy.   I had the Irish curried chicken over rice and it was quite good. The curry was sweetish, but still had a nice bite to the finish. The chicken was all white meat and nicely tender, and the peppers and onions that were in the curry were delicious.  My partner had the Guinness beef and veggie stew, which was also really good. There was lots of beef in the stew and the Guinness added a really different (and delicious) flavor.   Once the trivia game was over, the atmosphere was great. Music was fun but not too loud for conversation. Our server was friendly and helpful. She made great food and drink suggestions, and even gave us info on places to check out during the rest of our trip.   Ri Ra is definitely a solid 4* and we'll be back the next time we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So sad. This used to be a favorite place but it seems a lot has gone downhill since the last time we were there. We went with friends before a concert. We were off to a good start with water, but as soon  as we started ordering actual things, it all went to the dogs. First, the waitress spilled beer all over our friend's leg. 15 minutes later, we hadn't seen her so I asked the hostess for a manager. I had inquired into the bangers and mash, since it was no longer on the menu (How is THAT not on the menu??) but the waitress never told me if it was available or not. The hostess took our order, the manager apologized. Somewhere in there, our appetizers were actually put into the kitchen and were eventually delivered. We ordered more drinks. They took a while but showed up. After an hour, someone came to tell us that our order had been held up because they were out of something for a burger. In the meantime, the table next to us got their food despite having come in 20 minutes after us. They said we didn't miss much because their food was cold. The excuse given was that they had gotten busy.  I get that, but when you are a restaurant in uptown and there is an event, be prepared! By this time we had been there for almost and hour and a half. We decided to pay for our drinks and get something to eat at the venue. There are at least 2 other Irish pubs within a block or so... they will be getting our business next time."}
{"text":"We drove from Harrisburg with reservations and your establishment was dark and locked. My husband has never been to RiRa's and I haven't visited in over 10 years. We reviewed the brunch menu and were pretty excited. Not only did noone answer the phone while we stood outside but we had to pay to park and left without Brunch."}
{"text":"I was fairly unimpressed with my food at Ri Ra... I ordered the lamb burger, which consisted of an under seasoned, overly large portion of ground lamb with a bit of feta on a bun.  Ri Ra redeems itself a bit with a nice pub atmosphere. Although... a more unique selection of Irish brews would be a nice improvement."}
{"text":"I never had the food here, but this is usually our go to spot on weekends.  There is a mix of people and the downstairs and upstairs are like night and day on the weekends.  The downstairs usually has a DJ with people sitting around which is good for mingling.  The upstairs there is usually a live band playing.  There are a bunch of good beers and drinks.  If you get bored work your way to the dance floor to watch a bunch of drunk people who cannot dance worth a damn.  Its a site that needs to be seen.  Also, there is an outside patio upstairs where you can stare directly at other buildings.  This spot is both good for the young and the older.  Its a mix of casual meets semi dressy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times at this point and it's always fairly good. The food is decent but nothing to rave about and the atmosphere is a good one. I haven't hung out here but from what I understand it's good for the bar experience. I usually go here to dine though as it's convenient to the Belk Theatre. This last visit I had steak tips and potatoes and honestly it wasn't great. The meat had a funny taste to it and the potatoes had no taste to them and some of them had gone bad I think. My grandmother had the fish and chips and she said it was decent. So for what it's worth that was our last experience. I've kind of combined all my trips into this one rating so 3 stars is about all I'd give it."}
{"text":"My wife and I really wanted to like this place - but it's hard when the service is mediocre.  I will say that my food (lamb burger) was excellent.    Our server appeared very disinterested.  The tables near us were getting the same treatment, overhearing comments of \"what's her problem?\" after she appeared exasperated when she was asked menu questions.  Sure, they were busy, but they weren't packed to the gills (there were open tables).  Mainly, it was the lack of attention.  After our drink and dinner order, our appetizer arrived with our entree - then that was it.  The server saw a few tables near us, but never returned to our table despite our beers being empty for a while.  45 minutes after our food arrived, we finally get to order round #2 - which took 30 minutes to get to us.  For beer.  Several other tables near us were walking to the bar to get their drinks.  Needless to say, I tipped poorly compared to normal.  Probably won't be back - they aren't the only Irish pub in town."}
{"text":"Now THAT was a FISH and chips. It was great. The Mac& Cheese, needs a bit of help with flavor, maybe should have added chicken or something. The Mule and Cider were fantastic. Exactly what you expect from an Irish pub ~ dim lights & dark woods. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Pub. Staff was awesome and the Jameson was perfect. If your looking for a real Irish Pub, this is the pave your looking for."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Ri Ra.  However, I hate the uptown (parking makes me anxious), so my visits, unfortunately, are too few and too far between.  In 2009 when I read that they had a fire and would be closing down for a bit for renovations, I am fairly certain a tear or two rolled down my cheek.  My arteries opened a lil bit, but I was mildly distraught.  Thank goodness they did the renovation and re-opened!  Recently before an event at Blumenthal, my date and I schlepped it over to the Ri Ra.  After parking at the BoA deck, it was a short walk, and was only a few quick steps away from our final destination of Blumenthal/Belk to see a concert.  Want to sit at the bar?  There are 2 beautiful dark wood bars to park your rump at to slurp down syrupy beers and shots.  High tables with stools?  Got those.  Tables that you can get up and down from without flashing your stuff if you have on a skirt?  Have those too.  2 floors of seating, all dark and lovely, give you plenty of room to pop a squat and enjoy some Irish/bar food at it's finest.  There is even a small terrace/patio upstairs for enjoying Carolina blue days when it is a little warmer out.  My secret dream in life is to find a nice Irish boy to move to the green, green Irish countryside with to spend my days waiting for his liver to pickle/fail.  I LOVE corned beef and cabbage - it's a sickness really.  And while I love to make it, it stinks up the house, so it's always nice to be able to find this delicious dish where it stinks up someone else's kitchen.  The corned beef and cabbage at Ri Ra is delicious.  The corned beef is tender and not terribly stringy.  Well flavored.  the cabbage is... well... cabbage.  Cabbage-y.  Cabbage-ish.  Nothing fancy, just good.  The mashed potatoes that go with are creamy without being runny.  Hearty Irish fair for a green-eyed girl.    For an appetizer, we ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip which is served with a portion of sliced baguette.  YUM!  Creamy, cheesy, good.  When it hits the table, resist the urge to dig in immediately, or you will be peeling the top layer of skin in your mouth off for the rest of the night.  HOT.  Molten hot.  I previously had the corned beef/cabbage/mashed potato egg rolls, but I didn't see those on the menu.  That was a bummer because they were off the hook good.  I followed the dip with the corned beef and cabbage.  Happy tummy.  We decided to split a dessert and got the peach pie.  That was not a winner.  I don't know where on the pie our slice was, but it was the part with no peaches in it.  I think I accidentally ate one, but I may be mistaken.  Normally I am too full to eat dessert anyway, so this isn't a deal breaker, but I won't be getting that again.  On previous visits I have had the Reuben, which is stuffed with tender corned beef and served with a side. The colcannon side is tasty(mashed potatoes with cabbage mixed in).  The macaroni and cheese is creamy with a crumb topping.  So many things on the menu look delicious, but I almost always stick to my standard Spinach dip and then corned beef and cabbage.    Great bar/restaurant, awesome ambiance and great food!"}
{"text":"This review is of their Ri Ra Sandwhich shop around the corner since there is no separate listing for this shop. Stopped here because I've never been before, so I ordered the old faithful Reuben. Pretty hard to screw up, right? Well they managed to serve me a sandwhich that was barely eatable as the corned beef in it was like leather....very hard and chewy. The sandwhich was small. For $9 I'd expect a LOT more. The Rose Sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Not a very good sandwhich.  Service was iffy at best. The young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable, but the other two seemed like they didn't want to be there...aloof is the appropriate term.  The ONLY saving grace were the Keogh's Dubliner Irish Cheese and Onion Potato Crisps imported from Ireland. If this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they won't be in business long.  So a SMALL sandwhich, chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $14 with tip. That is a LOT for a LESS than adequate sandwhich. I will not be coming back.  NOT recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here for \"brunch\" before having to board a flight home.   I got the Holy Grail Ale and the Breakfast Burger. The ale was tasty and the burger was quite good.  Though I would warn anyone that if you're going to go for this burger make sure your stomach is empty, skip breakfast, go in starving.  This burger is the biggest thing I have ever eaten in one sitting! But, oh my, it was tasty. The kind of clog your arteries good. I don't think I needed to eat again that day.   The only complaint I had was that the service was a little slow for me given I had a flight to catch and mentioned it to my server."}
{"text":"My brother took me and my parents here after a Bobcats game.  It was pretty crowded and my brother and dad had to pay a cover (it was ladies night).  We were able to find a couple of stools together and sat down.  The bartenders were very quick to come over and get our drink orders.  We were also seated close to the live band that was playing, who were awesome by the way.  It is a little smokey inside but I didn't come out smelling of smoke so that was a plus.  Some people had ordered food and it did look pretty tasty.  Next time I will have to get some spinach and artichoke dip which is what the people next to us had.  There are two levels, from what I've heard the upstairs has more of a club atmosphere, needless to say we didn't venture up.  The first floor was great if you ask me.  Live music and good drinks, can't get much better."}
{"text":"always good food, and a great selection of beer that will satisfy"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick pint and the selection of beer and whiskey are great and the bartender was friendly.  Kinda confused how a Irish pub does not offer Scotch Eggs though."}
{"text":"not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok..."}
{"text":"I had the Cuban chicken sandwich, which was really good. The bread was done just like a Cuban sandwich down in Miami. The sweet potato fries were OK, the dipping sauce was good."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT place in uptown, within easy walking distance of the CATS Lynx Blueline train. Great location, awesome atmosphere, and the food is just incredible. My favorite is the Guinness Beef Stew - tender meat, savory gravy, just perfectly made. It's got an intimate atmosphere, but it's a pub so depending on when you go it can get pretty rowdy. Great staff, definitely a place you should check out!!"}
{"text":"Moderate beer choices and decent food. Even though this is a very cookie-cutter Irish pub, not a bad place to kick start your happy hour."}
{"text":"I ordered the stuffed French toast and \"won brunch\" amongst the group of seven I was with. I highly recommend it. Don't waste your time and calories on anything else!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Have been to RiRa in Providence, RI. Ordered fish and chips and short ribs. Ratio of fish to fries left my husband hoping for more fish. Short rib was chewy although flavor was good-- not worth $18. Although I respect and appreciate the fact it was grass fed. Additionally we were seated at a table that was super awkward-- legs made sliding into the booth cumbersome. Decent service. Probably will check out the myriad other places Charlotte has to offer before I'd come back"}
{"text":"(Only commenting on Ri Ra as a bar as I have not tried the food) Get some more staff! This place is terribly understaffed, on a Friday night there should not be only 2 bartenders for a packed bar. Easily takes 10 min to get a drink. I like the space and the patio but it means nothing if I can't get a drink."}
{"text":"I've had good times at Ri-Ra, and I've had some bad times. Most of the good times were due to the band playing, which is sometimes really good, and most of the bad times were a combination of bad music and overcrowding.  This place has been a popular mainstay of downtown/uptown as long as I can remember.  It's tall and long inside but very narrow, and when its crowded it can offer up a bit of a claustrophobic vibe.  Since its so popular, it can draw a bit of an unruly, late-night crowd as well. Most of the people here are cool however, and the staff seem to be nice and accommodating.   Still, its hard to get a beer or drink, and I usually don't spend more than an hour or two here before bailing for more comfortable confines.  I can't speak to the food, as I've never eaten here. I have seen a menu though, and it looks decent, and decently priced."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is a typical irish pub with dim lighting, dark wood, plenty of beer and whiskey options and a menu full of specialties like fish and chips and bangers & mash.  Ri Ra has a nice food menu with burgers, salads and appetizers that complement the traditional fair.   I dropped in for a quick bite before a show at Blumenthal the other night.  Service was very quick and friendly.  My friend and I ordered buffalo wings for dinner - each order came with about 10 wings.  They were satisfying, regular wings.   What's  great about Ri Ra is the atmosphere.  It's quite large, but feels cozy and casual."}
{"text":"I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast, and the price was reasonable for downtown.  The salad looks like it could be good, but there is no way for me to know because they were out of utensils.   How can a place that makes salads to go be out of utensils?  And the worst part is that you don't know it until you already through the line and have paid.  They should let people know before they pay.  The guy at the register made no apology or attempt to find some way to provide something to eat with.  Now sitting at my desk with a salad that I can't eat, gotta give it one star for the poor service."}
{"text":"This Ri Ra is one of the better in the chain.  The furnishings are Victorian with splendid chandeliers and lots of dark woods. They have a great patio which does not catch the sun early in the morning, making it perfect for brunch on a warm summer day.  Try the wings.  They have a slight tartness but are also smokey and a little chard.  On our last visit we had brunch- the sausage and egg boxty and Irish Benedict.  Both dishes were suburb, as was the service.  The previous evening, we hung with the upstairs bartender before a concert next door.  Great service there as well   They host an Irish session on Sunday nights-  So happy to see an Irish themed pub making an effort by supporting local Irish musicians."}
{"text":"My friend had Sheppard's Pie and I had a great Burger with Onion Rings, Red Onion, Ri Ra BBQ Sauce and I threw away the bun fo fun and I'm on a diet, so I say.  First we had Potato Cakes and wow they were good.  This is a fun place!  It  exudes Charm and though I would not call it Romantic I do not know why I would not!  We were here last week and wanted to stay, though wound up at Vapiano, so all week I kept thinking when are we going back to Ri Ra, I only took a week.  Few places have such charm that I believe influence my enjoyment of the food.  Ri Ra seems to be one of those places!   Our server, a girl who lived in California was great!  They were staring to play trivia as we were finishing.  We were glad to be finishing!   More on food:  I always enjoy a few bites of a good Shepard's Pie though I would never want more than a few bites!  This one is the best I've tasted 4.0 yelp stars.  My burger  mmmmm 4.1 stars. Ri Ra BBQ Sauce 4.9 stars, Fries (someone loved them) 3.2 stars.  The Bread was a dark, thick, hearty, fresh wonder (looked like Chocolate Cake) 3.89 stars.  Onion Rings 3.2 stars.  Potato Cakes are hard to rate, I've had them in Brit Pubs, Irish Pubs and German Restaurants, these were very good, maybe 4.85 stars or better and they were served with sour cream and balsamic.  Nice Touch!  For dessert we had the very disappointing Special Irish or Baileys Chocolate Mousse and the slightly better Flour less Chocolate cake.  I'll rate the Cake 2.89 yelp stars, I had two bites and though neither of us liked it that much and my friend doesn't even like Chocolate someone cleaned the plate.  This Dessert was after the meal!  I would go back and get the Leak Soup, though it was Soup of the Day and I would check out the Fried pickles and see what else might look good!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go out, mainly because of the live music. The cover bands do an excellent job, and it's a great place to go out with friends and unwind after a long week of work."}
{"text":"Food was okay - fries overly salty and everything else just eh, nothing worth coming back for. The service was poor (unfriendly and seemed very bothered to even be at work) and with disappointing service and mediocre food, wouldn't come back despite the 20% off coupon from the Carolina History and Haunts tour."}
{"text":"Just average unfortunately.  The good:  My drink...dark and stormy is going to be my new standby.  The mediocre:  Everything else.  Burger was just so so as were the fries.  The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce, but that couldn't save it.  When asked how our food was I was honest and could tell the waiter was taken aback. I mean seriously, don't ask me if you don't wanna know.  I was polite about it, but said that the dessert was just average.  And questioned why it was cold.  Bread pudding is always warm no?  He also got docked a few points for twice trying to take my plate while I still had more then half of my food left.  He actually removed my girlfriend's drink while she was still working on it!    It was nice to have a late night eating option in uptown, but unless someone else wants to go I won't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick bite and a drink before heading over to the Fillmore (in an uber) for a show. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were both extremely friendly and took great care of us. I had the Avocado Smash (no pickled onions). It was delicious, and a perfect light supper for me! My SO had the Reuben. It looked delicious and he crushed it. They have a very decent wine list and a good selection of drafts.   Ri Ra is very close to many hotels and other lively spots, but I would definitely come back again for a casual supper."}
{"text":"This was the most pleasant dining experience I had on my business trip to Charlotte, and of course it occurred the afternoon I was leaving. After spending a week in suburbia hell, I wanted to see if Charlotte actually had a downtown, and happily I found it, along with affordable parking. We were super hungry, so we literally stepped into the first place that served food once we got out of the car. Luckily it was Ri Ra. I hear this is a rocking place on the weekend, but on a cold Tuesday afternoon, we pretty much had the place to ourselves (except for the loudmouth \"screenwriter\" at the bar). We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed Harp on tap and sandwiches. My pastrami was delicious, but if I could do it again I would have the full serving of the magnificent mac n' cheese. The lunch menu was extensive with very reasonable prices. The best thing about this place however was our waiter, who is getting married in Jackson Square down here in NOLA this August, bless his heart. He was super nice and attentive with zero fakiness. Best of luck to you, kind sir!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I went on a Monday! Did you know Mondays are half price burger Mondays! The bartenders are the greatest, I had the bacon cheese potatoes and they were great. I will post a picture later, I will definitely be back to try more. Heard on weekend crowd is crazy, not going then but will go on week days when already in uptown.  There was kids that even came in sat in seated area, I sat at bar and watched sports center, did get a little busy but was very much like a dive bar, in a little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Such a cozy pub! We came here as a large group on a Saturday night to celebrate my sister's graduation. The service was very accommodating and quick! Our waitress was actually from Dublin :)  They have a fairly large beer list, a lot of which are on tap. For dinner, I had the Irish breakfast, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The rashers were actual Irish rashers, not the greasy strips of regular bacon you get at a lot of other places. It was a ton of food and for a really great price!  We also got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was super creamy and cheesy- I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The decor and feel of the place is great. However, we came to celebrate an anniversary and it started out great and went downhill quick. The bartender was nice and we are at the bar. I ordered the beef stew but it came out cold. I asked them to reheat it and they did (which took 10 minutes oddly enough) but the mashed potatoes on top were still cold when it returned which makes me think they transferred it from the previous plate. I think I was supposed to get butter with my bread so I asked and they brought out some frozen butter in a tin. What am I supposed to do with that? lol. Anyways, great for drinking but skip the dining experience. I really wanted it to be good because the one in Atlanta was excellent.  Too bad another poor service experience ruined a special occasion. Ri Ra's off the list of places to visit in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, however I do want to say that I went to the deli next to the Hearst tower. It was super busy though!  Each sandwich is hand made to order and it was not bad. I got the smoked salmon BLT which was actually surprisingly not bad. The prices are a little off to me, but I guess you're in the city maybe that's how it goes. This place is an in and out restaurant. Call what you want what bread you want (and make sure to say roll instead of for example wheat which is sort of just like bread) and they'll make it and you'll be out in a couple of minutes depending on how long you wait in line.  This place has pretty fresh ingredient and I would no doubt be coming here if I was working downtown. However, this place I give three stars for the wait time, the prices, and that overall it just wasn't amazing nor bad."}
{"text":"Not often I'm disappointed...  Bad service, like waited a long time for a drink order to be taken and fulfilled. The drink, Bourbon Apple Cidar, presentation and taste was horrible, no thanks.  They get one star for having an \"ok\" live band on a Friday eve."}
{"text":"Great little place. The sliders on the brioche are amazing. One down side is that they have a great sandwich shop also but their items are not served at the pub. The sandwich shop is only open for lunch."}
{"text":"My mom and I were going to see Rent and only had a few minutes, deciding last minute to get a bite to eat. We went to riras thinking of getting an app, not realizing they served brunch. It was so good. I got corn beef potatoes hash she got a waffle. We definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was Disaponinted with the amount of time it took me to get service at the bar !! Staff was friendly and the decar was nice."}
{"text":"Lunch one day, had the fish and chips. Piece of fish was huge. For those who are picky, like me, no skin on the fish. Yeah! Fries were a bit cold upon service. I'm not sure if these were fresh cut or frozen with the skin. Leaning toward frozen with the skin.  They serve a curry sauce. I had no clue Irish used curry, but, turns out they do. I personally did not like it, but, I do not normally eat any type of curry."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this pub for dinner. We had their \"chips\" (aka French fries) as a starter. They came with two different dipping sauces. I had their chicken curry. It had chicken and vegetables in curry sauce served over rice. It was good but not exceptional. The decor was typical of an 19th or early 20th century Irish pub. The service was reasonably friendly and efficient. I would likely be more inclined to try something new and different than return here."}
{"text":"That being said, caesar salad wasnt anything to write home about. The fish and chips perfection. Crust was flaky as it should. Sweet potato tots are a delight. They give you a good cup portion. They do not need anything added to them. Unless you add salt to bring out even more of the sweet flavoring.  I would have actually preferred these over the luke warm fries that came with my meal.   We had a genuine irish waiter who was in training and did a phenomenal job (and i am VERY big on service!!) My date loved his hamburger. Consider i was not offered a bite as i usually am it must have been delicious.  The calamari was a bit over priced for the size. It was served with banana peppers a balsamic vinegar dribble, and a red sauce that reminded me of salsa but with a more tomato base and no spice. I have had better calamari at hole in the wall restaurants."}
{"text":"I haven't spent much time at RiRa's for late-night drinking, mostly because of its reputation for being crowded. But I had an awesome, nap-inducing dinner there one night.   My friend and I had done an afternoon fundraiser/bar crawl one day and we were starving afterward. We headed to RiRa's at around 5 pm, before any of the crowds got there, and we were seated upstairs. We were the only people up there for most of our meal. Had we been on a date, the candle-lit atmosphere would have been awesome. I had the beef and Guiness stew. It was heavy and so so delicious. So my point is that if RiRa's doesn't suit you as a bar, definitely try the food during a less-busy time. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Not too much to say bad about this place. The ambiance was what you would expect from a true Irish pub. I especially their specialized seating. For instance we had a raised booth next to a storm fireplace that overlooked one of the bars. The food was excellent as well. The deep fried Reuben was probably the best Reuben I've ever had. Wife at the hooped salad and she said she loved it. I had some of the kid's fish and chips and and they were both good. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great location. Food is okay, service is awesome. Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love Irish Pubs and pub food, but the food at Ri Ra was bland and without taste.   I ordered the Goat Cheese Fritters as a starter, and the Corned Beef and Cabbage as my main dish. The fritters were nothing more than goat cheese balls rolled in some sort of dry breadcrumb-like coating and then deep-fried, and topped with caramelized sweet onions. There was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste.   Corned Beef and Cabbage is an Irish Pub staple, but Ri Ra has absolutely no clue how to prepare it. The corned beef was bland and somewhat tough, and despite the fact that they put some sort of cream sauce on it, it still had no flavor. The cabbage was both undercooked and without any hint of seasoning. Even adding salt and pepper did not help it. I did not eat the mashed potatoes that came with the dish, so I can't comment on them.   Ri Ra is a fairly nice looking place with a decent selection of beers on tap, and if you just go there for drinks, you should be fine. However, there are many places where you will get a much better meal, and I would definitely avoid the food at Ri Ra."}
{"text":"I have been to his place a few times as I always RT to hit an Irish pub on my travels (well at home too).   Question: why the hell is an \"Irish bar\" playing rap music at 1040pm?   I heard two ladies say, \"I hate the music\" and left. Without spending any money. Overheard another 2 couples complain about the music and I went up and talked with them and they agreed to the same thing I thought : we came in her to get away from that and hear the music more associated with an Irish bar.   I asked the bartender, and he said , \" well Saturday night in Charlotte \". What the hell does that even mean? Anyhow, after talking to the hostess, she explained that a band was supposed to be playing but that they could change the music.   They did change the music so I stayed. Thanks to the hostess.   Come on management, no one comes into an Irish bar to hear rap!   Since the music was changed while I was writing this, I revised my rating to a 3 instead of a 1.   Interesting, people now tapping feet etc."}
{"text":"Burger Mondays, all burgers on the menu, half price! This is one of the best lunch deals in Charlotte and it has made everyone in the office gain weight. Walking out of there paying $6-7 for lunch is a steal. Nothing spectacular about the burgers, but the price does make them that much tastier. Above average pub food for below average prices!  The only reason this lunch service does not get 5 stars is due to the recent deterioration in the materials used for the burgers. There has been a noticeable depreciation in the quality of the buns and the fries are a hit or miss. That said, still worth every $1 on Burger Mondays.  Good beer selection, our office partakes in Happy Hours at Rira too, good times always, extremely friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"This was the first Uptown pub we went to when we arrived in Charlotte. It has a great atmosphere, a helpful staff, and a GREAT menu of not only food, but BEER. I've brought all my Florida friends to this pub when they come to visit me.  It's like I have to share the wealth.  :)  In our most recent trip to Ri Ra (our 1st time back since the fire) we discovered the UPSTAIRS.  We did NOT know this existed.  There was an AWESOME band on stage, a nice dark, candle lit dining area and a cozy little patio to go enjoy a smoke. I couldn't believe we had missed this \"upstairs\" before. I can't wait 'till my friends come back for a visit so I can show this off as well!!!    Bravo guys!"}
{"text":"Cool Ipub in dtown. All the regular beers on draft. Decent bar food, large place"}
{"text":"Went there in a Saturday afternoon, we were just in the area for a show, thought we tried this place out. I had their beef stew, which was to dead for!! Great atmosphere, too. Looking forward to go hand and see if it's also cool for a drink on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I need to update my glowing review. On a Monday night a friend and I were craving bar food so I led her to riras as I love(d) the food. However, the burger that I raved about in my last review is no longer on the menu :( it looked like there was only one or two burgers left. My friend ordered wings and I ordered a veggie burger with sweet potatoes fries. My friend's wings were pretty puny but she said they tasted fine. She ordered Brussels on the side and she said they were very bland. My veggie burger was good on the inside but the bread was hard (maybe stale). My sweet potato fries were cold and burnt. The best part of my meal was the magners. I'm really sad this place didn't provide us the delicious food I used to the last few years."}
{"text":"Although the crowd can be a hassle on busy weekend nights, I have to say I'm a fan. Ri Ra is a large, interesting pub with a variety of food and drink options. I'm a sucker for the \"authentic\" Irish pub feeling, with lots of little nooks and crannies to hide away. It does make the crowds less overwhelming. Did I mention I hate big crowds?  The live music is usually fun, and the service is fast and friendly when you can get to the bar. The servers are good, too, if you get a table. I recommend getting in around dinner time and leaving before the late-night crowd gets too thick."}
{"text":"Do you really want to go to an \"Irish pub\" where you have pay a cover, shove your way through the ridiculous crowds, wait 30 minutes in line at the bar and pay five bucks for a Bud Light bottle?    It's definitely hopping on a Saturday night and boasts a nice and pretty downtown location...but god, do not think that this place actually passes for an \"Irish pub\"."}
{"text":"Apparently, reservations are not valued here.  We had a reservation for 7 and were told it would be a 20 min. wait.  Walked over to Harvest Moon Grille and had lunch instead.  Wish I could have reviewed the food..."}
{"text":"Randomly wandered into this fine establishment on a Wednesday night. Great setting to watch some playoff action with a beer at the bar. Bartender was friendly and quick. Atmosphere chill. Decorations were right on for an Irish pub."}
{"text":"True Irish pub feeling upon waking in! Ice cold beer on tap with many to choose from as well as several specialty cocktails. Typical Irish food offerings on the menu. There are a limited number of items to choose from but something for everyone, even very picky people such as me!!! My husband had the ham and cabbage and left not a crumb on his plate. I suppose that says it all!! I had the potato pancake appetizer which was beyond yummy and the very reason we ventured in to begin with.  I also enjoyed a cucumber/radish salad which was so yummy I'd certainly go back just for those two items along and of course a cold beer to wash it all down. The bar area appeared to have a \"local bar\" hang out vibe. That said we certainly felt very welcomed from the time we walked in until we left. They have bread from a local bakery that's different but in a very yummy way!!! Our server was very attentive when needed but also gave us our space. You won't be disappointed should you give them a try."}
{"text":"I normally HATE chain Irish pubs, but this particular one is a cut way above the rest.    Great food, very very nice staff, a perfectly poured pint of Guinness, and great (meaning talented and not obnoxious) Irish/Scottish entertainment."}
{"text":"I understand everyplace has its rules. My friends had a pre-wedding party here. And at 10pm it becomes a \" standing bar\" only. But did your staff have to be rude to the parents who were still sitting down a little respect goes a long way. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I went with friends to a show at Belk Theatre and we wanted to eat somewhere close. We just happened in to Ri Ra not really knowing anything about it. I can't remember having a better meal! The service was excellent and the ambiance is more than you could ask for in a pub. We felt like we were dining alone in our booth as we couldn't even see other patrons. I would definitely eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"AWFUL EXPERIENCE. Went for brunch at 1:45 PM on a Sunday on St. Patrick's day weekend. I made my reservation via open table. When we arrived, there was nobody working as a hostess. We were greeted after 5 minutes of waiting by a waitress who bluntly asked \"how many?\". We waited another 5 minutes for them to clear off a table so we could be seated. Once we sat down we waited 10 minutes for a waitress to ask what we wanted to drink. I placed an order for a beer and my girlfriend did not know what she wanted at the time and wanted more time to decide. When the waitress finally came back 10 minutes later, she asked what I wanted to drink again (having not brought my beer) and I had to place my order again and my girlfriend ordered a drink as well. Fast forward 15 minutes- we finally received our drinks and our glasses were covered in an unknown substance (most likely poor dishwashing). Needless to say, we grabbed the check and left. It seems like the restaurant was understaffed and the manager needs to look at the scheduling of employees as this was probably their busiest weekend of the year."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on New Year's Eve and the whole experience from door to table was exceptional as I would expect from Ri Ra.  Server seemed  just a bit disinterested but I can't blame her as afterall she was working New Year's Eve but she more than made up for it later in our meal.  We ordered a round of drinks and settled in to relax while looking at the menu.  Decided on the Guinness braised short ribs, one word:  DIVINE while husband choose the special of Pot Roast which they were out of and instead ordered a favorite standby of Sheperd's Pie.  After eating every bite and wondering if anyone would notice if we licked our plates (just kidding but seriously our meals were THAT good) we ordered dessert of Irish soda bread pudding which our server managed to score us the last serving of (told you she made up for her earlier seemingly disinterest) and shared its goodness over a coffee press.  What an excellent way to spend New Year's Eve and looking forward to our next return visit!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great Irish pub!  I was a little disappointed that the downstairs is completely all smoking tables since that seems to be where it is the liveliest but in all reality, it wasn't that smoky so we ended up eating downstairs anyway.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie which was veryyy good, definitely recommend it!  The decor is very authentic and could definitely see this place getting pretty crowded later on at night since the upstairs and downstairs are really not that big.  However, would recommend it as a place to check out if you are visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We planned to eat here but after 15 minutes waiting to get noticed we decided to select an alternate restaurant."}
{"text":"I cannot believe i have not reviewed Ri Ra's before!  This is a good after work spot for a few drinks and maybe a quick bite.  The bar is well stocked and has all the items you would expect from an Irish Pub.  They have a pretty good beer selection as well which is nice to see.  The food is pretty good but typical to what other irish places serve.  (Fish and chips, sheperd's pie etc).  The sheperd's pie is great though and i get it just about every time i come here."}
{"text":"Authentic Irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Expected selection of draft beers for an Irish Pub. Good selection of bottled beers."}
{"text":"GREAT beer list. EXCELLENT mojito's with fresh mint--even though it's an Irish pub you've got to try... Food is very good. Friendly wait staff--although they are quite slow. Live music and DJ's, great place to hang out with friends and  meet new people!"}
{"text":"We were there for my best friends 41st bday and sat at the bar. The bartenders attitude were like \"we r annoyed cause we r there\". Ordered food and asked for extra plates cause there were 4 of us, never got them. Had to keep asking for refills on all of our drinks over and over again.  The 1 bartender filled our cocktail 3/4 of the way, i had to ask for more redbull in the drink to top it off and he huffed at me. The food was very good but the bar tending service was awful."}
{"text":"The interior is all beautiful wood paneling which makes it feel like you're in Dublin. There's a wide variety on the pub menu, and even the more authentic Irish food was very good. A great place to watch soccer games and enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"I arrived here with couple of my colleagues for dinner since we had our business partner visiting us from out of town. Even though there were plenty of empty tables, it took them ten minutes to get us to the table. We didn't mind because we were having great conversation.   Once we were seated, our server was very quick. She took our drink orders and brought it fairly quickly. We told her that our two guest will be coming in few minutes and she didn't bug us after that until our guest arrived (I like that). We had enough time to decide what we wanted to order for appetizer so we ordered it right away when our waiter took the drink order from our guest. Again, our waiter just kept her eye on our drinks for re-fill from distance. If we were close to empty than she re-filled it. One of the think I hate about going to bar is they bug you get more drinks right after you are about half empty and it wasn't the case here.   Our appetizer arrived in fair amount of time, I had hummus and pita where I though pita should have been litte soft like I used to get at CANS when there were open. Now, we were down few drinks and we started talking about our college life so now god help us LOL.. I am glad I was able to keep it all PG13. We ordered our main dish while we are about half way done with our appetizers. By the time everyone was done with their collage story, our food arrived.   My goat cheese ravioli was delicious! I clean out my plate even after finishing my hummus and pita. We never felt we were pushed for additional drinks or any other items. That's how it should be IMO. I would have given them five star but I didn't like the wait in the beginning and I think they can improve on the pita.   I have been here plenty of time during night out for drinks but this was the first time I was here for dinner. All in all, it was great experience."}

{"text":"If you don't already know this, Irish Pubs are known equally as well for their booze (ales, whiskey, and lager!) as they are for their \"pub food.\" I award 5 stars to Ri Ra for exemplifying the latter quality in its lunch menu. Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip.   Almost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \"special,\" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \"Christmas in a bun.\" You decide.  AND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win.   I'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free). And you need to be beating the lunch rush, because once the special is out.... its OUT. Word has gotten out about the magic that happens at Ri Ra though, so don't get left behind :P  5/5"}
{"text":"Okay run of the mill Irish Pub.  Odd choice of music for a pub, nothing much Irish going on?   Litmus test - fish and chips. Mediocre at best Showmars is better!  Had an ice cold draft BUT would need many more to call Rí Rá anything but average."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service for lunch. The pub and the woodwork are beautiful. It has a great atmosphere for business or for fun."}
{"text":"This review is geared specifically towards their lunch time fare.  I was looking for a new place to put into rotation and dropped in here a few weeks back.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it much to the liking of a Subway but refined and truly fresher ingredients.  The service was ok, not really over excited to serve but I imagine that's because this place gets really packed so they stick to the business at hand.  I got there around 11:30am and any later I would have been in line with about 20 other people.  This place gets packed!  Of course a couple other good things about this location is that if the weather is good there isn't a much better patio for eating then right there outside, out front of Hearst Tower.  Also they have a loyalty card which is always a good thing!"}
{"text":"Personally, my husband and I love Irish food. We went to Dublin and had as much as we could. The food here is good and just close enough to the authentic Irish food. We love the history the wood and bar itself has as well. If you're here for drinking, they are not super light handed like most places. You get your money's worth. Irish coffee is strong here :) they even have live band events. Mostly expect rock/ alternative.even their bar music was enjoyable as well. hopefully everyone else gets to have awesome experiences like we did."}
{"text":"Hoegaarden on tap When you're in an Uptown mood Ri Ra is the bomb"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the steak tips and it was amazing. We happened to come here the day after St. Patrick's Day so it was not crowded. Everything came out nice and hot. I also order the mashed  potatoes and green beans and they were really good. The only reason I  gave it four stars is because it took a while for the server to get to us. And it made me wonder if we were ever going to be served. But once our order was taken, everything ran smoothly."}
{"text":"I heard RiRa's used to have a great brunch but something must have changed. My food was good but if you are looking for an extensive menu, don't like the very traditional breakfast, or want a great brunch atmosphere, this isn't the place for you. Might be a great place to grab a drink or watch a game. Good location in the heart of uptown."}
{"text":"Charming pub in Charlotte- great service and wonderful food. The haddock was amazing and their cucumber/ radish salad is the perfect side with it."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be.   What I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment.   Stick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here in between sessions during the college basketball tournament. Standard Irish bar, but the good thing was there was lots of room to sit or stand. We ordered a bunch of apps and shared with the table. Fried pickles, French fries, and we got a few Reuben sandwiches. All was good. They have a few of dipping sauces for the fries and pickles. Went well with a good Guinness. Our server Alex was super nice and although it was busy we got our good and drinks in a timely manner. Cool little spot to pop in when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"When Rira's Irish Bar first opened it was the only game in town on the NationsBank side of Uptown.  It was the start of Charlotte's new night life.    This is an Irish bar which means that the beer is good but the food is just so-so.  Come here for after work get togethers but hit one of the other restaurants if the plan is dinner.  Not bad for lunch though.  I just found out that it is a chain.  While I am surprised it does make sense  since everything in Charlotte tends to be a chain.  Very few places with local flavor especially in Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP, but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato, oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!"}
{"text":"I used to fly in and out of Charlotte all the time for work, and have gone to Ri Ra every time.  Whether it's trivia night, a good dinner by the fireplace, or just some brews at the bar I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the Irish bar feel, bartender had a genuine conversation with me. Felt very real. Guinness was poured correctly. There was an odd, potent smell through the whole pub, almost made me desire to leave without a beer but decided to stay."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Not on par with the other restaurants in the area but they do have a very nice whiskey selection. The food was a bit dry but the server was awesome!  Whiskey flights as well. Music really didn't seem to fit the restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"I had always avoided this place, a sense that it was probably dark and dreary with a residual miasma of spilt beer, tobacco, and fried food.  I was only partially correct.  It is indeed dark and dated (think 1985) but the food was surprisingly good.  I order a fail-safe burger complemented with fresh green beans, both excellent.  That said, it's the quintessential Irish pub with beer aflowing and 20-somethings clad in t-shirts proclaiming collegiate good times."}
{"text":"Thank you for constantly letting us host our events here! The staff is always so accommodating and the drink specials are fantastic!  -Team Ramrod"}
{"text":"I was back here again...but this time not at night, but during the day on the weekend for the \"UYE\" unofficial yelp event (since the Yelp Gods doesn't feel Charlotte is big enough to warrant an Admin??????), so I was lucky enough to meet some fellow Yelpers that I've chatted with from time to time online.  With the World Soccer match with the U.S.A. fighting to stay in the game, the bar was both packed and loud....but with the TVs turned up as loud as they could go, our little group didn't stand a chance to have some engaging conversations.  The server was great though and kept my beer bottles full.  For food, I actually commandeered Julia's order as it wasn't right for her, so I had an Irish version of Eggs Benedict which was good. All and all this continues to be a good bar in town"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection and wonderful food choices. The fish and chips is the best I've ever eaten. We love making this a stop on our bar hopping nights, and we always at least stop in for a beer when we are downtown. If you have time for food, you need to try the traditional Irish cuisine."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were great. Shrimp and grits was a great Irish twist on a southern favorite. Potato cakes were also good. Service was fast and friendly. We stopped in visiting Charlotte and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Have been here twice in downtown Charlotte. Very nice atmosphere to relax and enjoy the city. Food is half decent, beer and wine selection very good.   Service was half decent, very courteous and prompt. Would recommend anyone in the area to try it out"}
{"text":"Stopped in on whim for Happy Hour.  Had delicious fish tacos.  All small plates were half off for Happy Hour making this place a steal for good food.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Thursday evening to get close to the fireplace.  Once again, we were told that this seating is only allowed if we order food.  Now we just came from dinner, but I'm always up for an excuse to order more food so we agreed.  But the table wasn't even close to the fireplace.  Really couldn't feel a thing.  We ordered four appetizers and the mac and cheese.  Honestly, the most impressive thing was the curry sauce on the chicken sliders (which probably came from a pre-made packet, if we're being honest with ourselves here).  The mac and cheese was runny, the potato cakes fell apart and had a weird texture internally, the experimentalist sliders were dry, the spinach and artichoke dip didn't taste at all like spinach or artichoke, and the brussels sprouts were undercooked.  I had a cider, but everyone else ordered a warm drink, including a hot cocoa--these seemed to be a hit given the goal of warmth.  It was pretty cool that they had a live band (of two) rocking it on stage, including a mandolin and a cover of Hallelujah.  It was difficult, though, to get our server to pay any attention to us after the food came out.  We didn't get asked about a second round of drinks, we had to ask multiple times for containers to pack up the food, and it took forever to get the check.  I still like the place, but I'm not able to call this visit a win."}
{"text":"Ri Ra's is a popular place to go if you're up for a big (and by \"big\"  I mean wild and drunk) night out in Uptown Charlotte--that much has been well-documented. I've definitely partaken of a few of these nights. It's a nice bar, with lots of room and generally lots of fun people looking to get after it. Again, this has all been said before.   What I wanted to write about is that Ri Ra's is a nice place to head for lunch, especially if you're downtown (or Uptown, whichever your prefer). They have a really efficient salad and sandwich line--it's conveyor belt style, where you pick your bread, your meat, your toppings etc. It's a really quick process, and so it's a good place to head if you're not sticking around, or if you're in a rush. But the food holds up--it's not bad at all.   It's right next to the Bank of America building and offers a huge plaza of outdoor seating, so its location is ideal. Especially when it's nice out."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Irish pub experience then this is the place for you! We came for lunch which I was kinda bummed, I wish we had came for dinner because for dinner they do live music! We saw the little stage where the performers set up. None the less we enjoyed ourselves. You walk in and are immediately transported to Ireland. I loved the layout of it! I believe I counted 3 different bars! Don't forget to go upstairs!   The food was very authentic. We ordered the potato cakes to start, which I don't know how you could go wrong it's like the best food ever, and they were delicious. A little small but it was an appetizer. It had a balsamic drizzle on it along with the sour cream, it was very interesting but delicious. It also was on top of some green lettuce, which I really didn't see the point in that much, I just didn't eat it. They were cooked perfectly.   For my entree I had the Shepard's pie. It was definitely authentic. There was no cheese and it was lamb instead of ground beef. Though I prefer our Americanized version better, what they deliver is clearly what is stated on the menu so I'm not mad about it. I still ate it all. My brother had the Guinness burger and he practically devoured it in 3 minutes. My husband had some turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon and apples. He liked it. I tried a bite (for the sake of my yelp review of course) and it was pretty good as far as a turkey sandwich goes. The bread was toasted nicely and buttery. They each had sweet potatoes fries as their side which were also very good.   All in all we were all satisfied. I loved the decor of the place. And a shoutout to our waiter (Tom) who was super sweet and attentive. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!!! The Cottage Pie and Fish & Chips were excellent. The service was fantastic.  Will definately be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place in Charlotte, but not the worst either. We came here on one of the three snow days CMS had a few weeks back. There weren't many people which was nice, but surprising since everyone was off!   The menu was what I expected, a typical Irish pub menu. I couldn't really find anything I was in the mood for and either could my boyfriend. We ended up just getting an order of French fries which were surprisingly really good. The prices seemed a bit high for what was served. Even though we were hungry, we stopped at the fries because of the prices. I noticed the drink prices were a bit steep as well. I actually didn't have anything to drink because of that. My boyfriend had a few beers and bought a round of car bombs for his friends (10$ each-again pretty pricey) and the tab was about 50$.   The inside was nice, pretty dark but definitely had the feel of an Irish pub. I will say the service was great. Or server was very attentive and personable. We actually ended up seeing him out at the next bar once he was off his shift and we had a great time hanging out with him for a bit! Overall not a bad place to hang out with friends and have a few drinks, but not my top pick in Charlotte which has so many other places that offer better prices/drink specials/food."}
{"text":"During my one visit (before a big rock concert), Ri Ra'swas crowded and loud while we were there.  They were doing trivia in the back of the place, which was fine, but a little distracting if you weren't involved in the game.  Also, we put our name on a wait list and were never called . . . ever.  Ending up eating at the bar.  Speaking of the bar - the drinks were pretty weak.  I literally wondered if I was drinking watered down bourbon because I didn't taste a tone of ginger OR bourbon in my bourbon and ginger.  The highlight was the food, at least mine.  I got the brisket sandwich and fries.  The brisket was very tender and everything had good flavor.  I asked for a side of the curry sauce and I do not kid or exaggerate to say it is out of this world good.  If they had sold it in to go containers, I would have bought some to take home.  My friends both got the Reuben and described it as somewhat chewy.  I don't think I've ever had a \"chewy\" Reuben, so that wasn't very promising.  So, in any case, \"a-ok\".  I'd go back and give it a second shot when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say, they haven't gotten any more of my business"}
{"text":"Our favorite Irish Pub!!  Amazing Food!!  Potato Cakes, spinach and artichoke dip and Fish and Chips!!  Great date night!! All amazing!! Great for live bands when you can catch them!!"}
{"text":"I always manage to go here when there is a decent cover band playing on the 2nd floor.  Usually my group of friends show up early enough (right when dinner is ending) and the bar transitions into night mode so we always miss a cover (if there is one)... The coziness of the upstairs makes for a great experience.  One bad thing to mention was the staff... we were ordering drinks and it seemed like it was taking forever.  Yes, it was starting to get crowded, but it seemed like our server favored certain groups of people - maybe an assumption on my part, but it was based on attire and maybe how much tip she would anticipate getting from the group.... Later when we were all ready to go a close our tabs, we basically had to recite our drink orders to her since she didn't even bother to keep track for us.  Outdoor deck upstairs is great in the summertime, but now that they banned smoking in the bars (hooray!) it turns the deck into a smokers haven at times."}
{"text":"I only go to Ri Ra for the nightlife aspect, so I'm not going to comment on the restaurant aspect. And as for the nightlife, I don't mind going here, but don't really prefer it either.  Located right in the heart of Tryon in downtown Charlotte, this place becomes really packed on weekend nights. And while I don't mind paying the $5 cover for guys, I don't really enjoy this bar when it gets way too crowded. It can get very difficult to move, either upstairs or down, but sometimes you can move out to the patio on nice nights & find some breathing room.  As for the atmosphere, Ri Ra has just never really done anything special for me. I just think of this place as a nicer bar that's always crowded, so I'm always looking to get out of there when my friends want to stay. They have live bands some nights & that just adds to the claustrophobia of the upstairs. If you can get a table, the place isn't as bad, with a good beer selection & excellent bar tab system. You can open your tab at either the upstairs or downstairs bar & then proceed to order from either bar. This takes away from the hassle of always having to go back to the same bar you opened your tab at.  Other than a nice setting inside, Ri Ra just never seems to impress me and/or make me want to come back again. I'm sure there is a reason the place is always packed, so I guess I'm just out of the loop on loving this place. So while it's not a one of my favorites in Charlotte, I don't mind the place for small chunks at a time."}
{"text":"I didn't know Ri Ra's was a multiple location place, I've eaten at the one in Portland, ME a ton of times and this place is awesome.  Service and food qualiyt was great and a fun location to drink at!"}
{"text":"Two for two...been here twice, loved it twice. Maybe it starts with the interior, but doesn't end there. There is also the well executed, but simple menu. Had an awesome lamb burger and the hand cut chips, with two drinks...happy guy."}
{"text":"I love going to RiRa and it's a fun atmosphere!  Downstairs is more restaurant/bar with a very large, long bar area.  On some nights they have Irish music which is a lot of fun too.  They have pretty good food and I really like the Banger Bites!  Upstairs turns into a club space on weekend nights with a DJ, so that can be a lot of fun too.  There is an outside patio upstairs, but I haven't been out there.  Definitely a low-key working man's pub and a solid Irish bar choice for uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here yet but I already can't wait to. Stopped in with a friend of mine to get a beer and think I found my favorite pub in charlotte! If you are looking for an authentic Irish pub this is the one! Everyone that works there is straight out of Ireland and could not be more welcoming. My friend and I could've stayed all day chatting with each of the bartenders we met. Ray and the others were all fantastic! Recommended great beers for our tastes as well. They have your Irish beers as well as local beer. Also have liquor and wine. The place itself makes me feel like I'm back in Dublin with its detail. It's upstairs has live music at night sometimes and the patio is pretty nice if you're lucky enough to go there when the weather is appropriate."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed. The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  as well. I liked it and the atmosphere of the bar."}
{"text":"I have visited the Charlotte Ri Ra several times when I have been in Charlotte on business and have always enjoyed myself. Yeah, it's loud, crowed and very smoky (especially for a smoke-free Californian), but that's what makes it a Pub. When traveling on business I often have to find placed where I won't feel awkward dining alone, and a lively Pub always keeps me from sticking out. This evening I just had the Guinness BBQ burger, a few pints of the dark stuff and I stayed for the acoustic music.... I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Irish pub style restaurants, and this really isn't a place to order food...more of a place to drink with friend's, etc if you're under 27 and looking to bar hop Uptown. Their fish and chips looked as if it had been dunked in Vaseline, and the chicken I ordered was literally so over-cooked it was just crispy skin and bone. The menu isn't extensive, so keep in mind your options are limited."}
{"text":"We went here to kick off a bachelorette party on 3/7/2015. First, they \"lost\" our reservation that I had received confirmation of weeks prior. I guess luckily they weren't busy and we were able to be sat in about 15min. Our waitress was either new or not having a good night as she was very not a people person that evening. About 5 of the menu items we asked about or tried to order were all sold out or discontinued. I went there specifically for the Guinness Beef Stew and was informed that even though it was on the Chef's Specials menu, they will no longer be carrying it. Pretty much all of us ended up ordering burgers since that was one of the few items they did have available. When our food arrived and we asked for silverware, our waitress informed us they were out of silverware then had to go try to get silverware from another server. All in all, I (and pretty much everyone in our party) will not be returning here to eat, ever. I hadn't been in a couple of years and I guess a lot has changed!"}
{"text":"Ordered a salad to go for my lunch. The bartender with whom we placed our order, was pleasant enough, but it took the better part of 30 minutes for our take-out orders arrive. Really? Take-out should be quick, otherwise it shouldn't be offered. I ordered the Top Chop Salad. The chicken breast pieces were so tough and dry I was unable to eat them. Not what one would expect for a small $12 salad. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Whenever I decide to venture uptown i always want to go to Ri Ra. This is definitely because any time i decide to go uptown i want to dance and boy is Ri Ra a great place to dance at. They play top 40's pop with a good mixture of old and new songs mixed in. If you are looking for a place where you don't have to bump and grind this is the place.   I've also never had a problem getting a drink at the bar fairly quickly. The bartenders have always been very nice and make great drinks."}
{"text":"My fish and chips were really pretty good. I got the regular size and the piece of fish I got was enormous. I can only imagine how huge an actual large would be."}
{"text":"I was looking for a brunch spot on Easter Sunday that took reservations for a party of 8 and didn't break that bank.   Their brunch menu is perfect for people with a wide variety of likes. There are quite a few people in my family that prefer lunch food so it was nice having the option of breakfast and lunch.   Our waitress was fantastic! Very attentive and made sure we never ran out of water or coffee.  Food wise the shepherds pie was outstanding! They serve it with bread (it was ok) and butter. The special was a prime rib with au jus sauce that was cooked perfectly and was generous in size. The Brussels Sprouts are tasty. They are served shaved rather than whole or halved which made it easier to eat. Warning: they are very salty. Next time I'd ask for less salt.  They have lots of great boozy drinks and a Bloody Mary bar.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for business and came for lunch with my boss. The sandwich line was pretty long so we decided to go inside the restaurant to sit down and order. The hostess and server was great. We ordered and our food was brought out fairly quickly. It was a Monday and lunchtime but the place was not packed when we got there. A few more customers did trickle in while we were there but it wasn't crowded. My boss ordered a soup and sandwich combo and he said it was delicious. I ordered the Irish stew with a side of cesar salad. Both were delicious as well. I loved how the stew is made with lamb and it a nice cracked pepper taste to it. A co-worker of mine said that they have the best macaroni and cheese but I did not try it. I wanted to try the fish and chips may have to do this on my next business trip. There are way too many restaurants in the area that I have not tried yet and want to before I go home."}
{"text":"Ri Ra is a fun spot to hang out with pretty good food as well. As I started my reuben adventure around Charlotte to find the best one the city had to offer, I couldn't think of a better spot to begin. I wasn't disappointed - it's funny how sometimes the first can be one of the best on a journey.  The corned beef on the reuben at Ri Ra still stands out as either the best or at least in the top 3 of the about 30 reubens I've tried so far around the city. The best way to describe it is tender, hand carved meat off a well braised chunk of real corned beef - none of that deli meat stuff. It's beer braised and the flavor is just incredible. The rest of the reuben almost isn't worth talking about after that, but I'll keep going anyway.  The cheese was good, but there wasn't enough to really come through the other ingredients. The kraut was clearly made in house and pretty good, and the bead was above average rye with a perfect crisp. If the proportions had been better this likely would have been the top reuben on the adventure. Ri Ra has an excellent reuben on their menu and it's absolutely worth stopping in to try it."}
{"text":"This place disappointed us. We waited over an hour for two orders of chicken wing's, a fish and fries and a Spinach and artichoke dip........ My nephew ordered a Salmon sandwich and after being there over a hour they informed us that they were out of it. My chips were old and my sister's Spinach smelled spoiled and tasted horrible. It was our first and last time ever eating here."}
{"text":"Only had drinks here. Have yet to come here for a meal but I want to. They have a a great/kind of unknown patio upstairs. Downstairs is dark and cozy. Always had great service from the bartenders and their accents are a plus!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had a great experience before a show at the nearby Blumenthal theatre. We were a little tight on time, but the service was fantastic and the food came out very quickly. There was still plenty of time to enjoy what we had chosen before we needed to rush off to the Broadway show.  The management even took time to stop by and see how we were doing.  They have a good selection of local craft brews, which is cool and smart! Shop, drink and eat LOCAL!  Ri Ra gives you that true authentic Irish look, feel and taste!   Sláinte!"}
{"text":"In the midst of the hype about the World Cup, Dirty Dave S. sent out a call for a UYE (that is, Unofficial Yelp Event), guerilla-style - that is, with very little warning.  Four days to be exact.  Surprisingly, we had a decent turnout - Dave, myself, Denise E., Julia S., Erik, Michael E. and Tonya P. showed up at Ri Ra, and had a small amount of time to snag a table in the corner of the pub.  Then they turned on the sound.  By \"they\" I mean the other patrons and their vuvuzelas and the bartenders, who turned up the sound of the televisions to compensate.  At that point it was almost pointless to be there since we couldn't really hear anything other than the horns and the extra-loud buzz of everything trying to outdo them.  Still, it is what it is (to steal a phrase from John Fox), and it is - or was - another UYE for the history books.  Thanks for the call to arms, Dave!"}
{"text":"Ri Ra's is a good ol' fashioned Irish Pub. The most noticeable difference between it and a pub in Ireland is that it is a lot bigger than a pub in Ireland, though it's still a lot smaller than your average restaurant.  The food and atmosphere are amazing. They have the best shepherd's pie I've ever had, bar none. Their soda bread, while not traditional, is very good and is a perfect compliment to their OUTSTANDING potato and leek soup. It's the perfect thing to warm your insides on a blustery evening. The burgers are just okay. The decor is great, with the heavy wooden tables and stone fireplaces, it feels like a real, rustic pub.  The prices are a few dollars more than I think is fair, thus the 4-star rating. Be sure to join their rewards club so you can get discounts and gift cards to make it more affordable.  Oh, and they have live music later in the evening on weekdays."}
{"text":"Came here last minute after the international soccer game. The place was packed out and even first available tables were going to take forever. I was walking around a very sweet server went up to me and said if we sit outside on the patio she would serve us right away. DONE DEAL! We got a table with a great view and someone at a different area was playing music. It was perfect!!   We started off with the popcorn crawfish. I don't see a lot of that around here in charlotte so I wasn't really expecting this to be that great. I was wrong. They were delicious and came piping hot to the table! It was a decent portion and there were big chunks of crawfish in it! I also got the salmon sliders. Salmon was cooked perfectly. The whole thing was delicious. We didn't wait that long for food either!!  We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pub atmosphere both indoor and on their rooftop area.  Great place to have a pint, share good times with friends, and enjoy the great food.  Menu prices are just a little steep but worth the price as you relish the Irish cuisine with a Guinness!"}
{"text":"So the mother moved to Charlotte in May and I finally got the chance to visit.  I got in Thursday night and she took me to Ri Ra after work because I was super hungry.  It looks exactly like an Irish Pub that used to be in Elmhurst (IL), which was awesome.  I got a snake bite, because after flying, you need booze.  Mom ordered a shandy, and it was delicious.  I got the reuben, which was awesome, and not heavy or greasy.  Mom got the chopped salad which was also great.  We sat on the upstairs deck area and people watched.  It was pretty cool.  The weather was great as was our server.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more food, like the curry fries and fish n chips.  Granted, I probably won't be able to be back for a few months, but still, the food is great."}
{"text":"I was at the sandwich bar and ordered the Italian.  The service was slow and couldn't care less especially the cashier.  The food itself was ok, but not the Italian you would get in NYC.  Charlotte's nice version though.  The line is long and slow though so expect to wait.  The bar part and the upstair dining is great for drinks and apps.  That is all folks."}
{"text":"Hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude! Stay away from this place.   We (4 people from a convention at the Omni) walked in at 5 pm on July 3. No one was uptown and the place was completely empty. We told the hostess we were there to drink. She said..\".OK, Make yourselves at home\".  I told my friends what i wanted to drink, stepped away to the bathroom, returned to find all of my friends standing. I asked what was going on...they said that the Hostess came over and told them that the table was reserved and that we had to move to the bar. Really? Reserved for who? Uptown was completely empty, their bar was empty...they were making NO money.   We decided to leave and go to Rockbottom because we didn't want to sit at the bar...we wanted a table.   As we were walking out, I told the hostess that \"it was too bad that they were missing out on the bar business\". Her response was.....\"Oh, that's OK\". Then she proceeded to make other remarks as we were walking out the door. Unfortunately, we didn't bother to stick around and listen to the rest of what she had to say.    What a way to represent Charlotte and your Establishement, RI, Ra.  Word of advice....FIRE YOUR HOSTESS WITH THE BAD ATTITUDE...and INCREASE YOUR PROFITABILITY!  Sorry to be so mean in this review....but this is unfathomable"}
{"text":"Okay if you are under 25 years of age.  Band downstairs very good but upstairs was full of twenty somethings. Great if that is what you want! Drinks more expensive than other bars which was surprising"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon. Nice place and friendly staff. Try the Hoegaarden on tap. Saw quite a few families as it was a Sunday.  They play a nice selection of Irish music also."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here when I visit uptown Charlotte.  The decor and atmosphere emits the feel of a true Irish pub.  The Ruben is delicious and the Fish and Chips are yummy but enormous!  Bring your appetite and be ready to indulge in their assortment of beers."}
{"text":"Not cool enough to hang out at the pub, but grabbed a sandwich from the shop extension they got during lunch.  Abnormally high 4 stars from me, but today at lunch it was just amazing.  The weather was right, I was in a good mood and hungry.  Got wheat roll, dijon mustard, salami, swiss, some vegetables and banana peppers.  All tasted great and it was unfair because I got my favorite meat and cheese with perfect other stuff in sandwich.  Little pricey came to a little over seven bones, but whatevs.  Looking forward to washing my car, pumping some jams in the ride, getting a fresh haircut post-gym/tan/laundry. Maybe then I'll be cool enough for the pub.  dmo out"}
{"text":"The food was good, though they were out of the poutine. However, the service was lacking a little. While our waitress was nice enough, she was a bit slow to check up on us; for example, when we wanted more tartar sauce, she was nowhere to be found. She also didn't seem very familiar with the restaurant: what the name Ri Ra means, how to pronounce \"polluck\", etc. At the same time, she gave the impression that she was hurrying us out the door--she asked if we were ready for the check but failed to ask if we wanted dessert (we did). She wasn't the only poor server---after our meal, we went upstairs to check out the whiskey room, but it was practically deserted. We stood around for several minutes and there was no bartender or server to be seen. As if to emphasize the staff's lack of concern, we discovered that the satisfaction survey with our bill had already been filled out by a previous customer! Guess the staff isn't looking for feedback. Come here if you really like Irish food, but don't come if you want good service."}
{"text":"What kind of Irish bar can't make a Black and Tan????? This one!!!! Ho can you call your place a Irish bar and you can't make a Black and Tan???????? Wtf??????"}
{"text":"There's not much to say here, besides this is a nice, comfortable place in Uptown to get a good drink. The staff is good and the drink selection is great. It's a great bookend on the 5th & Tryon corner that features a variety of bars and restaurants."}
{"text":"Server was very slow and wasn't attentive.  Food came out cold.  Went there to watch a football game, as soon as the game was over, the bouncer made us leave our table right away to clear all the chairs from the floor.  We didn't even have the tab yet.  Bouncer was extremely rude.  Wouldn't go back there again"}
{"text":"Really nice outdoor patio. Sunday drink special on whiskey was really good. Very reasonable price for uptown. Nice variations on Irish cuisine.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"\"Potatoes and stew!! Guiness, Jameson, and did I mention potatoes?!\" Haha. We all love Irish culture, don't we? I mean I remember the green fellow who used to make me chase after rainbows looking for a pot of gold wgen I was a kid. Seriously, I ran like the wind.   Enough intro though. Ri Ra is a great place for everything. I first went there with my formwe boss and mentor for lunch. I didn't think I'd like it because I always walked passed it thinking it's more of a drinking, pub kind of a place. Oh, boy was I wrong. Everything was so good. The second time I went was for a friend's birthday party. She was a Cullen. So where else would we go right? And that experience confirmed my assumption that it's a good place to party.  Now, last Saturday, I found out that it's a great place for a date with the significant other, too. She loved it. I mean, happy wife, hapoy life, right? She was born in Europe so anything that Europe-like will imoress her. The fact that it's laid back type of place (and not the snobby places I usually like) also made her like it. But hey, we go there to eat and drink, right? Well, they hit it right out of the park with her basic beef burger, my NC grass fed beef stew with Guiness, the fries, and of course, beer!  We chose the dessert wasn't exactly her style because she likes soft, creamy browines but theirs was a bit dry. Maybe it's an Irish thing. But hey I eat anything (except apples). Oh, the rye bread!! How did I leave this till the end. We thought it was one of the best we had. And the butter that comes with it were real Irish. So good job all around impressing us. Thanks."}
{"text":"Oh.My.God. The place I go when I need a taste of home. Having said that, I have not been since the fire...but I expect the food to be the same. The Shepherds' Pie was outstanding, but could have been a better (read: larger) serving. The Lamb Stew was rated by my dining companion (read: ex husband!)  as the best he has ever had. I like the fish and chips, the bangers and mashed...but the service can be iffy. I think that the time of day/day of week is the determining factor here. Prime-time is the pits. I like the tshirts, too *g*."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party. Awesome atmosphere, good food, good service. My evaluation:  Facility: Good- Really cool place, apparently the bar and most of the accoutrements were shipped in from Ireland. Relaxing atmosphere, great place to kick back and enjoy a meal. The stools we sat in were not the most comfortable, but nothing to really complain about.  Food: Excellent - The food here is great. The menu selection is not too vast, but it's decent. I had the Lamb Roast Pie which was phenomenal. It had a goat cheese and potato bake on top, and I was pretty happy. My wife, who is picky, got the Hot and Smoky burger, which was great as well. The fries were ridiculously crispy, and just had that beautiful crunch to them. We had Creme Brûlée for dessert, which I wasn't crazy about. It was cold on the bottom, and wasn't completely \"burnt\" on the top.  Service: Good - The waitress was attentive and helpful, but didn't get in the way. Food came out in reasonable amount of time, and everything came out as ordered.  Overall we had a good time, good food, and a fun night. I give Ri Ra a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, the salmon was very good on a bed of cucumber and radish. Nice little place"}
{"text":"The building and atmosphere are great, huge selection of drinks. But if you're hungry, pick somewhere else. The food is over priced and leaves a lot to be desired.   I got the mac and cheese and paid extra to add the chicken. The chicken was super dry and had no flavor, and the mac and cheese was more like noodles and butter.   My friend got some chicken dish and her green beans were delicious but the chicken was just lacking in flavor. Especially for the price.   Great place for drinks after work, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years!  I remember walking in a thinking how large the space was.  I was impressed with the decor and openness of the bar. The staff was decent, not overly friendly, but not bad.  I stayed for one drink and that was pretty much it.    I would try this place again sometime.  The drink was good and the environment was nice."}
{"text":"With Dave all the way (well, except for the fish part) on this dark, classy, leather-encrusted Irish Pub. I hadn't been here in years and was kind of amazed how much it resembled pre-fire Ri Ra's. And yup, something about the atmosphere here (and in most other Pubs) puts me immediately at ease.  The game seemed to have them a bit frazzled, but you could also tell they were trying pretty hard. There isn't a TV for every 10 degree turn of the head, so that's a plus. Food is more interesting on the weekends, as they offer Irish brunch dishes - my Irish Benedict (1st try having gotten consumed by a table pal after arriving with rashers, a thick, ham-like meat) was good, with the potato cakes stealing the show. I'd come back on a non-World Cup weekend for this dish, absolutely.  Bloody Mary was meh, but it had a huge pickle spear as a garnish. Hard to be angry at a drink that comes with a pickle.  For me, Ri Ra's is a better place to hit off-hours with friends, all of us squished into a booth, talking about Ulysses. But its' sports bar alter-ego is definitively what pays the bills."}
{"text":"Great Irish options for dining and good beer! Service was pretty good too. Went there for a quick lunch date."}
{"text":"I have been a casual customer of RiRas for years.  I love the feel and atmosphere, very much get the Irish Pub vibe.  I have always had good food at RiRas and appreciate that unlike places that call themselves an Irish or British Pub, RiRas actually has REAL Shepard's pie with lamb, as well as a hearty lamb burger.  Often when uptown I am a patron of the side sandwich shop, which always makes the best sub uptown.  Yesterday I went in late afternoon with my boyfriend and young stepdaughters, after visiting the Bechtler. It was an off hour so we were seated promptly.  However, it was quite a while before our waiter came over.  When he did, he was quite harried and told us he was sorry but he just started his shift and didn't know we were there... hmmm, not a great start.  I kind of had to tell him he needed to get our drink order, which he did.  He was very courteous and friendly, but it was an odd exchange throughout the meal.  I just got the feeling he hadn't been trained very well/this was his first wait job.  He said he was new to the area so maybe he was just a bit disoriented. Again, he was very nice. My biggest disappointment was that I have had a delicious lemon vinaigrette there before, and he nor the kitchen staff seemed not to have any knowledge of it.  I have been eating healthier and I was really looking forward to that vinaigrette.  Disappointed they didn't have it or even know of it.  All in all I will return to RiRas, but for a place that's right uptown, they need to make sure their staff is aptly trained - the food is important, but that is 1/2 or more of the diner experience."}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints.  I took my girlfriend there this past Saturday evening for dinner (10/22/11).  I had my normal Guiness stew and she had the steak pie.  I had never seen the steak pie on their menu but it was amazing!  Services was great as always and we had a wonderful meal.  Ri Ra is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and if you like pub food this place is the absolute best!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and ordered dinner and drinks. Friendly, legitimate Irish bartender. He made great suggestions for dinner, both my wife and I enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Yea, I love a REAL Irish pub...  The folks are great the food is authentic. My favorite is the Shepard pie.   So here is a hint, If the Shepard pie is made with m Ground beef it is NOT Shepard pie.( its really Cottage pie) The good stuff is made with ground lamb.  The burgers I had were great and they actually cook them to the temp that you like. I usually order a meduim rare burger... IT WAS!!!   So it was Monday night and St Patties day to top it off. The crew remembered me from my day time lunch roamings. It was nice to have a Guiness or two, three,four...... I order a meal (don't remember what it was) but is was good and a great time."}
{"text":"Went to RiRa's sandwich shop today. Worst lunch option Uptown. Stale whole wheat bread, nasty, slimy, processed turkey - the cheap stuff that seems pressed together from regurgitated poultry. They don't post prices anywhere in the shop, so you're buying blind. So stale bread, 2 inedible pieces of turkey, a bag of chips, a pickle spear and a cup of water cost me $10.01. Threw most of it out. I will not be returning. My lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything. Find another lunch option if you care about taste and price."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I always have a pretty good experience. It has a decent siize bar with many options of beer on tap. I've gotten Shepherd's Pie and it was pretty good. I'll stop in again for a couple of beers, why not?"}
{"text":"I went out for the evening with my cousin since the place that she had a Groupon for was completely slammed last night...  We hemmed, hawed and finally decided on Ri Ra...   My experience was solid...  Our bartender Michael was an absolute delight... He was attentive and offered suggestions...  Since I already had dinner for the night, I wasn't very hungry, but I was interested in trying something... I decided on the potato and leek soup, which was incredibly creamy and delicious...  For drinks, I had the Jameson Rose (which was a vibrant pink... I don't know why that surprised me as much as it did, but it was pretty cool... lol) and a beer flight for $6.  The beer flight was Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's and a mixture of Harp and Guiness called the Half and Half... I thought it was a great value with some quality beers.    My cousin thoroughly enjoyed her nachos, but she sent back a cocktail... She apparently ordered a drink that no one ever asks for because Michael had to check the menu to remember how to make it... It didn't sound like it would taste great from the description and my cousin is ultra picky, so I don't fault him at all... lol  Overall, I had a fabulous time at Ri Ra... I might have to start going out a bit more often..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   Found out about this place when I did a haunted tour of fourth ward. This place is fantastic. Ri Ra doesn't blare music like other places which makes the place so much more fun to be in. The service is always on the ball and makes you feel part of the family.   The food and drinks are well worth it. The staff is very knowledgeable about the food and drinks. Love everything there is about this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Seems like the locals like it here too so that's good to see. Prices are average for bar fare and the beer selection is pretty solid. I only got an appetizer and a few beers but what I had was good and the service was prompt and friendly!  I'd rather be here than a few of the other spots I saw nearby. Plan on dropping a 20 spot for a couple beers and an app."}
{"text":"Walked right in and got a table. Other nearby restaurants had booked private parties with the CIAA in town. Great service and even better food. Also a great beer selection. Told the waitress we were on a schedule and only had an hour. She made it work. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This happened a while ago (several months), but it still haunts me today.  I ordered a portabello mushroom burger (I know, not really Irish, but don't judge). When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \"Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.  Now I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no, instead, he stuck w/ his server, made an unhappy customer, and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place, so I will go back w/ her, only urging)."}
{"text":"This place is having an identity crisis big time! Used to be a great little hangout years ago. Friday night looking for a place uptown that isn't 'clubby' and offers a nice atmosphere for a pint...go to thought, \"an Irish pub\". Should be low key and on the 'quieter side', right? WRONG!   This place was half empty at 12:00 on Friday. They had some live music - great love Irish folk music, but unfortunately they were blasting 90's iconoclastic tunes and country. What? You're an Irish Pub? Not only did the music not fit the 'vibe', but it was way too loud. Who are you singing to that loudly? The place is empty, turn it down.   Asked a waiter where everyone was and he said there was a DJ/nightclub area upstairs. Great, thanks for not putting it in the pub area itself...the country music was bad enough, but again confusion. If I wanted loud country music I would have went to one of the many rowdy country bars in the city.   The bartender was also not friendly. Attempted to make conversation and he pretty much blew me off. My friend asked to start a tab, bartender then brought the check which later caused a bit of a hassle when he tried to order a second drink.   Ri Ra's was great before the fire, but now it is defiantly on my list of places not to go whilst uptown. Maybe the afterwork scene is a bit different, but late night was atrocious."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with the girls. We all agreed that we would consider this place more if parking was not such a pain in the butt uptown.   All of our meals were delicious and we all left full and pleased. I got the corned beef scramble. It was amazing and had a good sized portion of meat- not all potatoes like many places do it.   Coffee was served in your own individual French press and they had a cool little band playing in the corner.   I definitely will keep this place in mind in the future."}
{"text":"It's very true that this is a serious meat market. But when it's not you on the market, it's quite entertaining on a weekend night.  Didn't try the food, but sampled a few of the drinks- and they were very good and tasty, however the alcohol content dwindled as the night wore on. Which, really is a good thing since one must drive home. Mixed blessing. Anyhooo... Great ambiance, fun (stupid drunk) people watching, GREAT band (Below the Belt).  If I were from Charlotte, I would definitely come back, especially to try the food."}
{"text":"Decent late night menu if you're really...really in the mood for pub food.  The burger was not bad...stay away from the hot dogs.  Nice to place to go listen to live local talent"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to RiRa's last night while waiting for our table at another place. I had been there before but he had not. I told him that he had to try the potato latkes and a Guinness. I had Jameson. We love the vibe of this bar. It really feels like we're sitting in an Pub back in Ireland. The Irish bartenders are nice to look at too.  The potato latkes were amazing as always. You get two in an appetizer portion. One of them was a little overdone on one side but still great. My boyfriend loved the Guinness and kept saying how long it had been since he had real Guinness. Even this morning, he said that was his favorite place that I've taken him to so far."}
{"text":"Really good Irish Bar, the pub burger was delicious as were the onion rings. Excellent beer and whiskey selection. Very clean establishment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We were there on a Friday night and LOVED it!! Upstairs wasn't our thing. We got a table below the band (a guitar player and drummer) and we just could not stop dancing! I haven't danced in public in so long, but their music got me going! Our group of 15 people ranged from 30 year olds to 60 year olds and everyone had a great time."}
{"text":"I like RiRa. It's by far one of my favorite bars on town. What makes RiRa stand out for me is the service. The bartenders/staff are always nice and attentive.  Their menu is pretty much the classic Irish menu you would find at any Irish pub. They have a decent selection of beer and cocktails, which is a plus. Food is good, nothing special tho. I'm not big fan of their burger, so I usually go with the Shepard pie, or fish and chips. The pie is great, and fish and chips are amazing! Worth a try!  In conclusion, RiRa is a good place for a drink and a bite especially if you're soccer fan since they always stream EPL on weekends"}
{"text":"Good Irish comfort food eats, friendly waiters, relaxed environment. A Charlotte favorite for me."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but haven't been in a while. Took my family there today during Taste of Charlotte (one would think they would be equipped for the crowd). The food was good but the service was terrible! It took nearly 20 min for someone to take drink orders and there were only 3 tables full upstairs. All in all, our lunch plans turned into a 2.5 hour endeavor and really became more of an early dinner. Needless to say, I won't be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"So it has been a while since I have been to Ri Ra's and now I remember why.   We stopped in for drinks and appetizers, for a going away party for a collegue at work. We arrived shortly after 5:00pm and were able to grab two tables in the back, which was nice.  With more than 10 people we required a server, to sit at the table. That seemed good, rather than having to order each drink at the bar.  However, our server was taking care of every other table in the back room and drinks at the bar so he was hard to find. Most of use decided to order our next drink half way through our first since we knew it would take a while to see that next drink.  As for food, they no longer offer happy hour specials so we ordered a few appetizers off of the menu, potato cakes, poutine, cajun crab cakes, fried pickles among a few. And, all were nothing to write home about. The poutine actually came with raw french fries of which we had to send back. And the gravy, that typically is poured over the fries, sat the bottom of the bowl and tasted like gravy out of the packet, thank you McCormick's for letting Ri Ra use your gravy mix...Nasty!  As for the drinks, steer clear of the martini's, $12 for something the size of shot glass. Not worth it.  I will give credit to the fact that they did split each check and they were all correct. Overall, great atmosphere to get together with friends but not my first choice and not sure I would return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Guinness Stew is out of this world.  I'm a fan of Ri Ra"}
{"text":"The sandwich bar is underrated in my opinion.  It's basically a make-your-own place where you pick the bread, spread, and tread (I don't know what else rhymes and goes on a sandwich).  The key is to get there before noon so you can find a table in the shade outside.  Fantastic scenery to watch while you crush the fresh sandwich.    Another tip is to ask for the frequent flyer card.  Buy 8 combos (chips + drink) get a sandwich free!"}
{"text":"Let's be specific...   I'm a fan of Ri Ra because one of my favorite cover band plays here often... and it's a nice low key joint for the most part.    No I'm not a fan of the super crowded nights when crazy drunken young men can get into fights just because the other person took a breath.    Recently I went there with a group of friends on our little 5th Street bar crawl night.  And I have become a fan of their curry fries!    Something addictive about a box of HOT fries mixed with a sweet yet savory curry sauce.  I don't think it's because it's late night and we've been drinking... or that I didn't have dinner (though I'm sure it has something to do with it), but I think I licked the box!   I'm not sure how curry fries are Irish, but I'm glad someone think that they are."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and whiskeys.  The bartender was legit.  Would like the music to be more authentic.  I don't necessarily mean Irish music.  At the pubs in Ireland I heard more 90's rock on satalite radio than anything.  What I didn't hear was shitty dance music, but I did here..."}
{"text":"First off, I've been here a few times and have enjoyed the bar scene here. I have eaten here twice and have found the food to be good, but not consistent. There are things on the menu I that are good and there are things that aren't.   The Baked Goat Cheese ($10.95) - Okay this is yummy. But it's an appetizer...and it's $11. But it's goat cheese, but it's an appetizer.....but it's good, so get it anyway. This I enjoyed and would've ate it by the boat load.  Publican's Reuben ($10.95) -('o'-) Oh my gosh look at that. My Reuben was the same price as my dang appetizer!  Haha. The Reuben was sadly not that great, the bread was soggy, and it was missing some more much needed sauerkraut. It just didn't have the tang or crunch I was looking for. The meat was a bit dry and bland as well.  My friend had the Fish & Chips Regular portion ($13.95). He said they were good, but could've been crispier. I'm not sure if the batter was exactly his favorite.  The first time I went to Ri Ra's with a group I had the Guinness BBQ Burger ($10.95) I liked this - yummy onion rings and Guinness BBQ sauce on top.  So overall - okay food good vibes. I'd probably give it another shot, just keep me away from the Goat Cheese!"}
{"text":"Standard Irish pub They can pour a Guinness Boxtys don't have stinking rice in them"}
{"text":"We went to Ri-Ra's for lunch and then for dinner.  The appetizers and sandwiches are really good, but the entree we had was pricey and did not have much flavor.   We did order some drinks, but there was little to no evidence that alcohol was actually included in our drinks....well played Ri-Ra's.  With that said, I would still come back here for a sandwich and some apps."}
{"text":"So on day two of my retreat in Charlotte, the ladies planned dinner at Ri Ra. I'd never eaten at an Irish restaurant, so I was excited. I was even more excited to see our amazingly hot waiter with his amazingly awesome Irish accent (so authentic!).  The ambience was sorta cool, with this totally traditional vibe to it. Granted we were an extremely large group, but the customer service sorta sucked (the server to our side of the table forgot my sweet potato fries and wanted to bring them out as I was finishing my food). I ordered the pulled pork sliders, and those were pretty good, as was the side of potato salad that came with it. I just wish my fries had come out as well, because they looked amazing on someone else's plate...  ohhhhh welll... guess i'll have to go back again next time!"}
{"text":"I've been there for late night bar hopping, dancing and watching live bands - which is incredibly fun!!  This was the first time I had actually sat down and enjoyed a meal there - it was pretty quite delicious. The soda bread & real irish cream butter was wonderful! The service was a bit slow (and they forgot that I had ordered a side of veggies which never made it or was ever spoken about again...) but all around not too shabby.   Best tip about this place: Upstairs there is a rooftop! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Guinness Irish Stew and Chicken Kerlee - delicious! Place has authentic Irish pub decor and COLD!! Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I went to RiRa for dinner on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly good. My husband and I sat at the long bar, while a fire roared behind us and the NFL playoffs were shown on the one television.    I rarely order burgers but was enticed by the Guinness BBQ Burger, figuring that it would be impossible not to pair well with my frothy pint of Guinness. I don't usually order burgers since they rarely meet my high expectations of a well seasoned, juicy, not-too-big-but-not-too-small beef patty, but RiRa delivered on all counts. I scarfed the burger, leaving little room for the good, but not great fries. My husband was very happy with his burger, which was some sort of super-spicy special and apparently left his mouth satisfyingly aflame.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Reliable, consistent food and drinks.  Live music (thursday when we were there).   Only reason not to give more stars; physically RiRa  is 'tired' looking with beat up furnishings.  Makes us wonder what the kitchen looks like??"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and learn tonight they actually recruit from Ireland for their servers. Excellent food grade beers"}
{"text":"Have been to Ri Ra many times. It is a must stop each and every time I am in Charlotte. Obviously, I am a fan of this place for its beer selection and lively ambiance especially during the early part of the week.  The food can be \"hit or miss\". Last night, for example, the Fish & Chips was very disappointing. For $14, I expected better quality.   The waitresses and bartenders are always friendly & first rate. I have held 2 company gatherings during various conventions without any problem.  Since I am tough on reviews, I cannot give RiRa \"4 stars\" but 3 stars is not fair.....let's call it 3.50 stars!! Work on consistent food .... and I will give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Just ate there today.  OMG the lamb burger is awesome.  Excellent knowledge of beer there.  Excellent atmosphere.  It's old school wood walls and tables etc.  I felt like I was back in Ireland again.  All the staff was also European of that area.  England Ireland etc.  It stunk a little but so does the area.  Could be related.  Excellent food though and ambiance."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in my brunch experience here. I read online live jazz music and mule bar for their new and improved brunch. I was sorely mistaken. Not only was their no music, my party and I sat for 15 minutes at the table before being served (this should have been a hint). Then they didn't have the mule bar available so they made my mule but somehow, when the check came, it cost $4 more because it wasn't the make your own. Needless to say I'll never be back for brunch.   I will say the food here is great though for both lunch and brunch and one of my favorite lunch spots during the week. Which might be why I was so disappointed in the brunch."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a drink on a Friday night.  One of the more authentic irish pubs i've been to.  The decor had a nice Irish feel and they had a band going at it upstairs(another example, they pronounce Smithwicks properly, if you don't understand, just ask an irishman)  They charged a $5 cover, ladies were free.   The place was pretty hoppin, lots of drunk girls having a blast.  We pulled up to the bar and had a few drinks.  A nice selection at a decent price.  When it comes to Irish bars I'm always a sucker for a shot of Jameson with a Guinness chaser and they didn't disappoint.  It sounded like there was alot more fun to be had upstairs(live band, dance floor etc) but we were just to tired to check it out, maybe next time."}
