{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, decent prices. Delicious Kalleh Pache ,Halim, Ghormeh Sabzi and Sultani. Don't forget to drink Dough."}
{"text":"The food is pricy, the environment does not look very nice  and Alberta Health Services says they once found mouse droppings in the place!!

{"text":"In a hungry state we sat down to a meal here, which was nice because there is definitely limited seating. I ordered the souvlaki platter, simple enough. My boyfriend thought it would be a \"great\" idea to order a steak, which was the most expensive item on the menu. The waitress tried to warn him that it wasn't as good as another dish when we placed our orders. But the boss is stubborn and kept with his original decision which then led to me, being very impressed by my fresh tasting meal and flavorful rice, and him complaining about everything having no taste.   The waitstaff were attentive, they offer Deli items at the till, and I would go back if in the area, and a quiet night."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  The Jujeh (chicken breast pieces on skewers is AMAZING!  So good and so healthy.  Only reason I'm not giving it a 5star is the service.  It's not bad, just non-existent.  Have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Not bad place. Cozy. A little disorganized. Meat is OK. Price is very reasonable. The other competitors are Atlas and Shirazi. All about equal, maybe Atlas/Shirazi slightly better. But I haven't tried everything at house of kabab yet..would definitely visit it again."}
{"text":"No bad, the food is Good, Service is standard. Most of the times, I order for pick up, the only negative thing is, Sometimes they include Bread and sometimes not. and I am deducting one star for that"}
{"text":"Simple, healthy, and delicious food. Service is fantastic. Lamb souvlaki is incredible. My wife and I eat here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go here, as I drive past it all of the time. So I was very excited to try it out this last week. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. We were barely greeted when we walked in and were waved to a corner of the restaurant to find our own table. Normally this isn't a big deal to me, but it's one part of an accumulation of things so bear with me. No one came to our table so after 10 minutes we grabbed our own menus. 5 minutes after that, our server came, and She asked us what we wanted to drink. I don't drink soft drinks, and wasn't feeling in the mood for alcoholic beverages, so I ordered water. I got the feeling she was annoyed that we didn't order more because it took a while to get them. Already a long time to wait for water. When we ordered food, my date and I ordered the most interesting and authentic looking things on the menu. And I asked for the fresh carrot juice for good measure. I was confused when I was told that they were \"running out of carrot juice\" (present tense). I said, \"sooo you don't have any carrot juice? Orrrrr...\" And she said yes. So I still have no idea what was going on with that, if they were saving what carrot juice they had left or the server just said the wrong thing, but there was no clarification or explanation. When our food came, I found it really bland. We both had very different dishes (stew and kebabs) and I was hoping for more flavour than we got. Halfway through the meal, the server told me they had carrot juice so even though I was kind of over it already, I said yes, hoping to be wowed. Nope. Nothing special. Overall, I rate places based on ambiance, service and food. This really had nothing going for it. Usually I'll give places a second chance but I really don't think that you'll find me here again."}
{"text":"Great quality kabob, best value for money out of all the kabob places in the city. The employees are very friendly, service is decent. The Ice cream is also very very good.   Cons: the doogh is home made and not great especially since they can order from arvand and use that"}
{"text":"An excellant place both interms of taste and price. Delicious Persian Cusine! We love the kobeedays, Kabob Sultanis, house made garlic sauce, Hummus, saffron rice!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Persian food! 5 stars for the taste and the price. My wife prefers Atlas which is another 5 star Persian restaurant but I like the more simple atmosphere here. We go to both places once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had!!   We walked in, seated ourselves, waited about 3-4mins for a menu (no big deal). But, a total of 20 mins went by before we decided to leave! We did not even receive water in that time. But I will tell you what I witnessed.    I witnessed three tables completed their meals and cleared the restaurant.   Two tables cleared their meals and got served drinks, but did not leave yet.   I'm certain our server pasted by us over a dozen times.   But worst of all, at the 20 minute mark, at THE moment we decided to leave, a table whom had walked in just 3mins before, received their menus AS THEY WERE GETTING SEATED, and 1min later the order was being taken by the server!!! THAT was the moment when we made our decision.   All the while, we had not yet even received WATER!! 20 minutes!   Might I add, in the first 15 mins, my husband and I were pretty content with our own company and I wasn't really paying attention to the lack of service. But, when the two tables had cleared, paid, left the building, and one more table arrived to be served before our order could even be heard is...dare I say is - DISCRIMINATION!!!   As we were leaving, the server didn't even look at us to apoligize, or get any sort of explanation from us. No eye contact at all!  I am so hurt, and terribly dissapionted. I normally don't even do reviews, and certainly wouldn't do them immediately after such an emotional experience. I would wait to calm down and give a \"rational\" review. But this particularly feeling I'm feeling is not something I want to mask.  I wanted to share it because it was unethical and not necessary. We love trying new foods and often support local businesses.   I'm still trying to make sense of it all. Were we really the victim of discrimination? I guess I don't know for sure, but the facts are: we were the minority in the room (not an issue for us, by the way) and MANY other people were served in many different ways before we were even considered.   All I do know for certain Ian that we will never again set foot in House of Kabob!"}
{"text":"Defiantly below average kebab restaurant. The chicken is okay but the beef was not good at all, you can easily tell it's just cheap group beef mashed together.  The atmosphere is not very friendly at all, we walked in there and everyone at the restaurant just stared at us the whole time. Much better kebab places in Calgary."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. I was just driving by and decided to stop and check it out. Not a very inviting place from the outside but once you're in the hospitality and food  is a whole different story.   I had ground chicken and beef kabob's with saffron rice. I know my kabobs so believe me when I say they were very good. Cooked just right and flavorfull. Now take note this is a Persian restaurant so light on spice yet good flavor. Owners wife was so helpful, when I asked questions about another dish (Ghormeh Sabzi), she offered to bring out a bowl for me to try at no additional cost, that had just been cooked. She also poured me Persian tea to try. All the food was amazing and hospitality was warm and inviting.  I will definitely go back to try some of the other stews..."}
{"text":"Was passing through Calgary and stopped by . They offered Dizi . So yummy and nice  Friendly staff.  Clean and healthy"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Iranian restaurants in town. And the staff and owner are quite personable. Service is friendly and food is good! Be sure to ask about the items on the menu if you are unfamiliar with Iranian cuisine. I recommend Sultani for kabobs and Fesenjoon for stew. Those are my faves! Also ask for the day's specials, you just might get nice delicacies that arent on the menu. :) The missing fifth star is for the decor and general look of the resto. It's such a minor point though. We always come back for more yummy goodness! :)"}
{"text":"Truth is that of all the Iranian restaurants in Calgary, there is not one that I can call perfect. You have to compromise on the venue, to get good food, or go to a nice place and get bad service. House of Kabab has one of the better Kababs I have tried in Calgary and their staff are friendly, if only they had a bigger nicer place!"}
{"text":"Affordable and good quality. A bit cozy and old place, but above average environment. Good menu, totally satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"We get takeout from House of Kabob all the time! Great food & great prices! The owner and staff are always very friendly as well. Recommend!"}
