{"text":"Would really appreciate 7 Numbers Danforth clearing their sidewalks of snow instead of throwing down a lot of snow."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I know that it has gotten high reviews before and that it is often quite busy, but I still regard it as a bit of a hidden gem! I was there with a friend who really wanted Italian food and we were not disappointed. The vibe was super relaxed for a Sunday night and the serving staff were extremely kind/helpful.  To start, we ordered the polenta with sausage and it was fantastic! My friend then got the linguine and the meatballs, adding them together. She was extremely satisfied saying that it was one of the best meals she has had in Toronto.  I had the burrata and fungi caldo (hot mushroom) salad.  Both were lovely on their own, but great compliments to one another!  I am gluten free so the only thing I would have liked was a GF bread option to dip into the EVOO and Balsamic...but that's just me being picky! I am very happy we went there and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some simple (but extremely delicious) and affordable Italian home cooking."}
{"text":"7 Numbers is one of our favourite Italian restaurants. It is relaxed and completely unpretentious. We have been here with friends, on date nights, and with our toddler twins for dinner. We've always had good service and enjoyed our food. Some of my favourites are the meatballs, involtini, and beet salad."}
{"text":"good food, ok service. ipad menus are ridiculous though. they make me feel. . . embarassed."}
{"text":"The food was great. Very friendly staff. I  recommend the fried egg plant. The sardines were a great app.

We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but wasn't impressed.  Not great Italian food.  The menu looked great, but the food was not.  

Pasta dish was skimpy on sauce and the menu said it came with ricotta cheese, but it was hard to see or taste it.  Fish of the day was ok, but not great.  Bread at the start was not fresh and the olive oil was low grade.

The location is great.  Patio is nice, but they have to improve the conditions a little.  The patio furniture is old and rickety - my chair's cushion was torn :(

Hope things get better.  Seems like a family-owned place which I love supporting."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best quality of service, food and atmosphere. The Burrata was so fresh and wonderfully decorated as shown by the photo I uploaded. Also tried the lamb and the meatballs which were both perfect in their own ways. The chickpea mash was also very flavorful. Definitely plan on coming back to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"disappointing, the food was just barely okay, even bread wasn't great.
everything is a la carte so quite pricey for what you get - quality-wise  and small portions
loud and difficult to carry a conversation if seated next to a table with a group of people

Lots of great restaurants in Toronto, but this isn't definitely isn't even close to being one of them."}
{"text":"For its price, 7 numbers delivers incredible values. We had a group of 8 and we went for the family style dinner and everyone was satisfied and filled. We were given a sample of their appetizers, all 3 pastas, and a main per person. I had the lamb shank and it was perfectly done.

The environment is definitely on the noisy side as other have mentioned, and the music gets louder as the night goes by. But if you're looking for a fun night out with your friends, this is definitely a great place to be!"}
{"text":"7 Numbers is one of my go-to places on the Danforth.

It has:
1. Great food
2. Decent service
3. Great value
4. A really good caesar (drink)

If it's just me and my SO, we'll order two antipasti dishes, two mains and two drinks for $60-$70 all in, and be full from that. As a point of reference, we don't have huge appetites, and usually like to save space for dessert.

For starters, I recommend the FRIED CALAMARI (okay, I haven't had any \"bad\" calamari on the Danforth but that doesn't mean I can't recommend it at an Italian resto), INSALATA DI SPINACHI (spinach, gorgonzola, walnuts, smoked duck breast - so much flavour and texture), and INSALATA CAPRESE (tomatoes, bocconcini, basil, EVOO - really simple but good).

For mains, my favourites are the LAMB SHANK (get it if you love peas, not too \"lamb-y\" for those who are not fans of the stronger lamb flavour) and the SEXY DUCK LEG (looks small, but is quite satisfying and done really well). The giant veal meatballs are also quite popular.

If you're going with a group, the family-style dinner for $29 per person is a solid option. You get a variety of antipasti dishes (we enjoyed five dishes for a table of five), the three pasta dishes, and an individual choice of the entree. Including a drink, taxes and tips, dinner comes to about $50 a head, but you are left rolling out of there. (It's been three hours since we left and I'm still over-full.)

I should reiterate that they make a top-notch caesar, since this is the only thing I drink through the summer, and have had my share of bad ones...

There's a skinny patio to enjoy on both sides of the restaurant, if the weather is nice. In the evenings they turn down the lights and light up the candles. It's a bit noisy, but conversation with your dinnermates is manageable. I like the ceiling tiles.

That's all that I can think of for now!"}
{"text":"There are always lots of kids and families early in the evening and it gets more romantic as the evening goes on.   They will do a great family style, just bring out the food, for $30 or you can pick your own. We've done this before for big groups, If it is just the family, we almost always start with the Burrata.  The amazingly creamy, ripe cheese is served with crisp focaccia and is AMAZING.

Vegetarians can always find some good pastas and particularly the side veggies - we've loved the roasted asparagus, roasted mushrooms and others.  Service is invariably friendly and present.  We now pass on desert there, having had a few misses (bland key lime pie) and walk over for Gelato on the Danforth if we are still feeling like something sweet."}
{"text":"After walking into such a homey and eclectic restaurant, this was the last place I expected to see iPad menus! This was the first time I've seen them used at a restaraurant, and although it was cool at first, it got a little annoying having to share the menu.

Anyway, upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly host and waited less than 10 minutes for a table. We tried making a reservation the night before, but they informed us they don't take reservations for parties with less than 6 people. Turns out, we really didn't need one.

After ordering, we were served complimentary bread rolls, which I didn't enjoy at all. It was really tough and dry so I only had a few bites. My boyfriend who normally eats everything and anything, didn't really touch his either.

Since we noticed that the portion sizes weren't very large, we decided to order 2 starters and 2 mains:

- Leoncini Parma Prosciutto - Italian DOP Parma prosciutto, fig & shaved Grana Padano ($9).The salad had a generous portion of prosciutto on top, but I wished there was more fig in it (there was only one small fig cut in half). Overall, just an okay dish.

- Lasagna di carne - homemade lasagna filled with ground veal & mozzarella. Since we intended on this being an appetizer, we went with the smaller size for $6.50. There wasn't very much cheese on it (which is my favourite part about lasagna). The whole serving was smothered in sauce. The ground veal was flavourful, but similar to our other appetizer, this was just an okay dish.

- Palmugiane con sugo - eggplant baked with romano cheese and topped with tomato sauce ($8). This was served in a home-style manner (no frills, just simply slapped on a plate). Unfortunately the taste didn't fare much better than its appearance. It tasted like I was just eating breading... I couldn't really taste much of the eggplant.

- Bitonds' Braciola Infornata - Thin sliced veal wrapped around baby spinach, hot peppers and Romano cheese ($11). Similar to the eggplant parm, this didn't look very appetizing, but it was surprisingly delicious! Very flavourful - this was our favourite dish of the evening.

In general, the portions are pretty small, but the prices are reasonable. Overall, I was left disappointed by my experience.  Since the restaurant had such positive reviews, I expected better."}
{"text":"Great spot very local the chef and waiters are very nice and welcoming. I had the meatballs amazing. Also calamari as an anti pasta very good over all."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here but unfortunately it was a let down. It started with a rather stale basket of bread and went downhill from there. The polenta and sausage appetizer was disgustingly oily and lukewarm. The tomato/ricotta pasta was also lukewarm and tasted like something I would have made for myself during my university days. My boyfriend didn't mind his lamb shank, but certainly didn't rave about it either. There's a lot of competition on the Danforth, so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We unexpectedly ended up here for dinner when another Danforth establishment was closed and didn't bother to cancel our reservations before we arrived.  The service here was excellent.  Our server was so helpful and all of her suggestions were spot on.  The food was terrific.  We had :
POLENTA ORGANICO CON SALSICCIA 
FUNGHI CALDO
AGNELLO COI PISELLI E CIPOLLE 
Grilled spigola served with a lightly spiced puttanesca sauce (PESCE DEL GIORNO)

Highly recommend all these dishes.

Desserts were key lime pie. flourless chocolate cake and their house special apple crumble cheesecake (best choice of all).

The whole experience more than made up for the disappointment caused by the previous restaurant.  We will definitely make this our first choice next time."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. Food, lighting and atmosphere are great and as mentioned before in a review below, they added a little \"That's cool\" for all the techies (and who is not a techie these days) to their spot - customers can view the menu via iPad! Extreme cool."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurent 2 stars as the main issue is that the food was warm. It appeared that the food was already prepared earlier in the day and sitting on a heated tray. It was a surprise that my food arrived within 2 minutes......not even enough time to finish half a bun from a basket of bread that was provided.

 I would rate this food comparable to what we call an Italian bakery with a hot table! 

Serving hot freshly prepared food is what I would expect from an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. Fresh hand made pasta right in front of you. Everything had great taste and texture. Loved the veal lasagna and meat balls. Great selection and value for the set dinner!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.  Decor and ambiance was great!!! The restaurant had a good selection for vegetarians.  The chef was accommodating.  Our server was very friendly and attentive. Will go back!!!!"}
{"text":"My family is very supportive of this restaurant but I must say the music is just too loud for my comfort. It takes away from the experience. Certain dishes are very good. I think the Sexy Duck is the best they have to offer. They will accommodate food allergies so just be clear if you need a dish gluten, dairy and/or sugar-free. I love exotic mushrooms but theirs consistently taste like the propane they are cooking with. 

The service is excellent and friendly. If they would lower the music I would raise my rating to a 4 stars given their desire to accommodate."}
{"text":"Go family style! 3 salads, 2 grilled vegetables, 3 pastas, calamari to start, 2 mains - we had the veal meatballs (always) and the veal chop...excellent unintrusive service...about 35$ each with tip, no wine though....."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Went with a large group, so the long wait for the food was kind of forgivable. Maybe it's just me, but I'm not really sure what all the fuss is about. I thought it was ok, nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievable! I can't believe I hadn't heard of it until my visit a few weeks back.

The menu is unique (no standard Italian fare here), quirky (Sexy duck leg!?) and accompanied by quite frankly stunning value for money. 12.25 for braised New Zealand lamb shank, a meal which my bf described as one of the nicest dishes he's ever had.

Inside it's dark, fun and atmospheric. I say boo to all those complaining about the loudness of the place. It's nice to go to a restaurant in Toronto that actually has a bit of vibrancy and edge to it.   The service is similarly suave, friendly and just COOL! On a practical level, they were also informative about the menu and speedy in their delivery of the yummy food and juice. 

Chalkboard menus are displayed all over the restaurant so you can always be tempted by their wine and dessert selection at any stage during your meal. Extra kudos for them for clearly displaying their cash and credit only policy in a very obvious manner on those same chalkboards. It's nice to not wait until the end of the meal before realising you can only pay in certain ways.

I had the orecchiete pasta with ricotta and the server suggested I try it with complimentary chilli flakes. An unusual combination, but it worked beautifully and the spicey cheesey mix was such a welcome change from typical Italian pasta dishes! I can still remember the taste weeks later! The portion was perfectly sized - you don't want a huge portion whenever pasta and ricotta are combined, and they got it just right. Pasta was perfectly al dente and the ricotta was to die for.

I cannot wait to go back here, but I do have one small complaint...the menu isn't very accommodating to those with more conservative tastes. Yes, it's amazing to see such creative and original twists on Italian food, but on the night I visited, there was literally no chicken or beef options. Everything was veal, duck or lamb (even the lasagne). The former vegetarian in me isn't too keen on eating certain types of meats, such as those above, so I found myself quite limited here.

 However, this definitely won't prevent me returning, especially considering that I understand this place changes its menu regularly.

Highly recommended, but vegetarians and fussy eaters may want to check the menu in advance."}
{"text":"How amazing is this place! Cute, unpretentious and authentic restaurant in a nice little neighbourhood. Our server took fantastic care of us from the moment we walked in for which I was super grateful, but the food really speaks for itself. As if I did not love Italian food and culture enough prior to this, 7 Numbers really made me want to be reincarnated in an Italian household.

The meatballs and the lamb shank were amongst the best things I've ever tasted and made me feel as if I were personally invited to someone's kitchen for a homely meal. The size of those meatballs... man.... 

For dessert we had the cheesecake which was apparently a winner at a dessert contest (sorry I murked up the details) but there's no question why and how! 

As other Yelpers have pointed out, there's great music in the background and our server introduced us to his colleague who had DJ'ed the set himself. You can tell the whole team works as a family and that's really something valuable that turns an already delicious restaurant's atmosphere up many notches."}
{"text":"Upon my arrival at 7 Numbers the staff seated the lady in front on me then totally ignored my party of two and tried to seat the party of two that came in behind me . I spoke up and we were then seated .
I am a little confused about this Restaurant, the decor and tables give the impression of a home style dining place . You know simple plastic chairs and brown paper on the table . 
However when the food arrives the portions are tiny fine dining style plus I can only assume the place is a la Carte because the protein portion was just that aside from about eight green peas . If this is the case the staff should have explained this . I was expecting a starch and a vegetable so I didn't order anything to accompany the protein. 
On the website they say simple southern Italian only five or six ingredients they may want to expand on that cause there was very little of the flavor I would expect from Italian cuisine. 
Also I ordered the Calimare appetizer it came as a tiny (even for an appetizer) sized portion that was soggy and tasteless in a pool of grease. 
In the end we quickly ate and went down the street to a Greek place and had a proper dinner . 
I certain will never attend this place again and certainly will not be recommending it to anyone ."}
{"text":"Wow, what a dining experience.  Of course it all begins with the food, and every item we shared was spot on.  The menu changes daily and is written on the wall, and also posted online each day.   When I went we shared veal lasagna, roasted duck leg, an arugula salad, and an appetizer made with of some kind of cheese and prosciutto (I forget what it was...the waiter recommended it as a substitute for the buratta appetizer which was sold out).  The duck was juicy and tender, the lasagna was salty and decadent, the salad was fresh and bright tasting, and the appetizer was cheesy-hammy heaven.   I forget what the wine was that we ordered, but quite a few bottles come by the glass or half bottle, which is nice for a teetotalling weekday.

With food this old-world-Italian great, you'd expect checkered table cloths, Italian crooner music, and candles stuck into old Chianti bottles.  Instead, the interior is dark, funky, and they play really good music really loud!   Eatin' some veal lasagna and rockin' out to some LCD Soundsystem!!     

And on top of everything else, the service was amazing:  friendly, quick, helpful.  An amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend to celebrate some friends getting engaged and we had a great time.  I had the grilled calamari to start and it was amazing!  I was a little disappointed with my lasagna main as I found it was just pasta and meat with very little tomato sauce, cheese or anything else for that matter.  Dont get me wrong, it was tasty but maybe just not what I was expecting.  The waitress who served us was also very friendly and gave me and my girlfriend getting engaged a free coffe martini.  Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to 7 numbers in about a year.  As I wrote in my last review, this restaurant is one of my faves.  I've been coming here for almost a decade.  For shit's and giggle's I checked out the Yelp reviews to see if there were any changes.  A number of Yelper's gave a low rating due to poor service.

Here's my story from tonight:

Arrived at 6:30 knowing we would need to be out of there by 8:00.  In my mind 90 minutes is enough time to have a good meal, a couple drinks and enjoy the company of good people (in this case, my wife. Ahhhhh).  It was pretty quiet when we arrived so we got great attention, ordered a beer and glass of wine and let our server know we would have the family meal ($34 each).  All good, great vibes, the salads (3) and calamari came out and was on point.  So far so good.  Next were the pasta's (3) and they were also as good as I remembered.  Well seasoned (some Yelper's commented on this) and very tasty.  Our protein, wife braised lamb and me the meatballs, was supposed to be next.  Somewhere in here everyone showed up at once.  So I get it.  Suddenly everyone from the servers to the chefs are now in the weeds.  And all I wanted was just a little attention, let me know the next course is coming....but nada.  So, at 7:55 I let the waiter know we had to go and we would take the rest of our meal to go, along with the bill.

We were having a really good time and then it all went so sideways.  We were fine with it and understanding that timing did us in BUT STILL, recognizing the issue and being even a little apologetic would have gone such a long way.

Perhaps other Yelper's are right or maybe this was a one-off.  We'll try again before making writing this place off.  Down to 3/5 stars from 4."}
{"text":"Went to this place for my girlfriend's birthday on her recommendation because she's been there before and really liked it..  I'm not a huge fan of Tapas, any time I experience the 'tapas life' I always leave wondering why I couldn't have gotten a FAIR portion for the price.  You spend more money and eat less food... how on earth does that make sense?  I don't actually believe any real quality is had over any other 'fine dining' experience I've had at a non-tapas style restaurant.  I'm happier, and will rarely ever feel like I've gotten robbed while sitting at a table enjoying food anymore.

I spent - from what I can remember - about 13-14 dollars on a piece of veal completely laced with sun dried tomatoes and sauce.  It was like eating a salt bomb with tomatoe sauce.  Since when does a slice of veal cost 14 dollars... seriously?  Or a duck leg cost 11?

I wouldn't be so negative if I thought the food was worth it, it wasn't.  The wait staff was very kind, helpful and great.  The atmosphere was alright, the music got pretty loud, which seemed out of place and the cramped seating makes you a part of everyone else's conversation.

Tapas restaurants try too hard to be... annoying?  Relish is better than this place.  I guess the whole 'eccentric' for eccentric's sake doesn't really work... sorry 7 Numbers...but your food just isn't up to par and we don't really want to be essentially eating WITH strangers."}
{"text":"A very small, cramped crowded space with no hope of a nice quiet dinner as large groups are seated close to tables for 2. The music is exceptionally loud reminiscent of a night club or lounge, so if you are hoping for a quiet dinner you will be dissappointed. The menu has some interesting and tasty options. The dessert menu was disappointing....not much Italian going on there. Overall, I was so overwhelmed by the cramped and loud space that I did not enjoy my meal as I couldnt wait to get out into the quiet night."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. The food is really good and I enjoyed the candle-lit ambiance. On the other hand, a caprese salad and lamb shank took close to two hours to arrive. 

We also didn't really understand the menu set up, in that you need to order something from both the primary and secondary menus. I got the lamb shank and the girlfriend got the sexy duck legs. I had assumed it would be the protein as well as... Maybe a salad? Some form of carbs like baked potato, fries or pasta? There was a sprinkle of capers, but that was about it. 

I think if we come back at a less busy time, and get something off the salad, primary and secondary menus, this would be a great date night location. There's a lot of potential to do better than the mediocre evening we spent here."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Wait staff is focussed, know their menu and their market, and make it happen with just the right touch of personality. Food wonderful. Sunny evening on the Danforth patio can't be beat. My second time here... Capreze salad and lamb shank. Primitivo in the glass. Wonderful."}
{"text":"\"F\" a Duck. Sexy sexy duck. Fell off the bone. Falling off the bone is a good thing, right?  Rosemary and white wine reduction baked into this Sexy Duck.  If you like hottt, tender Duck falling off the bone and entering your wettt mouth, this would be your Secondi.

What of the Primi, you may ask?  What to get as a prelude to F'ing a Duck?  Good question.

Answer:  AMAYzing handmade LASAGNA with ground veal and parmesan. Really, the best lasagna I have had since I lived in Italy.  

My friend said, \"I like to see the baby's face before I eat it.\" Well, not too appetizing but I have to respect someone who doesn't eat veal.  I, however, am not to be respected in this respect.

I wanted it and I got it.  He did not take a bite. That's ok.  More for me.

Served with chili peppers and fresh parmesan cheese. Made in-house and rich with all of the hottness and none of the niptuck of a Playboy model, these chili peppers disappeared quickly onto our all of our meals and into our mouths.*  

I also tried the calamari which was very fresh and perfectly fried and the Italian bread served before the meal was fresh and had to be refilled twice.  

Working backwards to to the Beets App, great way to start the meal.  Roasted fresh beets, ricotta, pine nuts and truffle oil. Beets are anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, good for your eyes...better to see you. The perfectly healthy vegetarian way to begin a meal that includes veal and duck.

You may think it is closed because the interior is so so dark but do not let your desires be dissuaded.  When we arrived my friends said with disappointment in their voices, \"It is closed.  Darn!\"  

I am thrilled so say that what we proceeded into what looked like a very dark opening.  

Proceed slowly into this dark, intimate opening and be served with caring attention while you groan with satisfaction.

*If you like the hotttness, ask for the glass of chili peppers with your meal - any meal - and thank me later."}
{"text":"7 Numbers is a really memorable place.  The first time here, what stood out was the cute decor and the high-quality menu.  

7 Numbers has friendly, knowledgeable staff that explains the selections very well.  The menu changes from time to time, which gives the touch of it being a place for trying different Italian cuisines.  

When first walking in, you might think it's a higher-priced place, and fir the food and service they wouldn't be wrong to do to.  But for what they offer, they're actually quite affordable!  

Excellent portion sizes served in a timely manner.  Palate aside, again one of the high points of 7 Numbers is the experience.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I actually give this restaurant a 0 out of 5. The service was horrible and the manager was arrogant. The food was just ok. They forgot one of our dinners and never apologized. Instead they gave us one meatball as a substitute for a steak dinner. When we talked to the manager he laughed in our faces and kept telling us he gave us a meatball and that was good enough. Well it wasn't!! Ive never seen such ignorance from a restaurant manager. We will never be going back!!"}
{"text":"Eclectic, charming and wait a sec... iPad menus...wha?

The decor is a hodge-podge that feels like the Green Room meets the Spaghetti Factory. The iPad menus felt cumbersome and a tad inappropriate in such a casual, lo-fi kind of place - but perhaps with the ever changing menu it has it's place.

The food was fresh and simple, great salads, stellar sides and the option to serve it up family style. How could anyone not love this good authentic homecooking?"}
{"text":"Love this local eatery - it's our go to whenever we want to have a great meal, and unwind after a work day. Always consistent with the quality of food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just read a couple of recent reviews and I completely agree - the food and service has seriously gone downhill. The service is terrible. The bread and oil basket wasn't great. I generally don't complain about freebies but I was surprised that an Italian reso would be serving sub-par bread. And I don't mind slow service but this was bad. We had to beg someone to take our drink and food orders. And when the food came, we all wished we had gone somewhere else. Everything - pasta, apps, sides, mains - was incredibly oily. I had to go buy tums to settle my stomach."}
{"text":"Came to 7 Numbers Danforth for Winterlicious ($28/person) a couple nights ago. It was myself and two friends. The restaurant is quaint and small but also nice and cozy. It's dimly lit with candles everywhere, definitely a nice romantic spot if you don't mind being around people that are closely seated to you. We were seated on a long table with individuals right next to us - it wasn't cramped per say, but it was definitely close - like the table could clearly hear our conversation and vice versa. All three of us ordered the arancini di riso where are rice balls covered in mozzarella and fried with tomato sauce. It was okay, it's definitely a heavy carb dish so if you're able to stomach a lot, it's a great appetizer if you're hungry. Taste wise, it was decent. The inside, with the cheese oozing out was delicious but if you had more of the outer edges of the balls with just rice and fried dough, it could be a little bland. Following that was the pollo cacciatore which is hunter style chicken thigh. Two portions on the plate with veggies, it was good! If I was to go again, I would order the chicken again, it's a solid dish with the right balance of vegetable sand tomato sauce to compliment the chicken. It wasn't overly cooked nor overly sauced. My two friends both got lasagna, neither raved about it but said it was decent. BUT the best part of the meal was the side of grilled zucchini -- DELICIOUS! Grilled with lemon infused olive oil - definitely stole the show at the dinner. We shared key lime pie and apple crumble cheesecake. All decent desserts, nothing extraordinary but definitely not bad. 

I would say that if you enjoy tomato sauce, a cozy environment, decent food for a decent price, then give it a try but I also wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"- i normally hit up the eglinton location, but decided to try it out
- food was pretty darn good. 
- as always the veal lasagne is stellar (have to get the large size!), as is the pasta with rapini (just add a touch of the hot chili oil and you're golden)
- cool thing about this spot is they've taken to technology and their menu (in addition to being written on the large chalkboard walls) is now distributed via an ipad!! no joke."}
{"text":"door number 7

Kickass Italian on The Danforth?  I would never have known if it wasn't for my Chef-y buddy.  I trust his recommendations because he's never done me wrong.  So I took to 7 Numbers for a quick weekday dinner.  It was busy, a little loud, a little dark, but a whole lot of wonderful.  A fantastic family owned neighbourhood restaurant.  The food was simple, rustic, homecooked Italian.  They give you an iPad to peruse the daily menu, as well as their extensive wine list.  The menu gets uploaded around 5 pm each day.  

I didn't experience any problems with respect to service and the food was hot, fresh and delicious, as well as generous.

My dinner company and I loved our dishes.  In fact, their meatballs rivaled my longtime favourite at Gio's. 

Keep in mind they don't take reservations for parties less than 6.  

This was a bittersweet meal.  I only discovered it days before I moved, but at least I did."}
{"text":"Not only is the pasta and fish to die for but they have this dangerously delicious lavender dessert shooter. Oh my gosh, incredible. 

Other great things: wonderful wine list, great atmosphere (dimly lit, very romantic. An ideal date night, perhaps?), prompt service, open kitchen which I am always a fan of, because you know exactly what your food is up to. 

Literally can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"This is a very decent Italian restaurant on the Danforth.

We had the family style dinner, where you get a generous amount of shared appetizers and sides for the table, and a main dish for $28. I had the spicy veal, which was thinly sliced veal baked around hot peppers. All in all, it was pretty good.

Only two kinds of beer available, bottles only.

The atmosphere and service were above average.."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Toronto, almost twenty years ago, I lived near the Danforth and I look forward to any opportunity to return to the east end. Where the west end is littered with franchises and trendy hipster joints, the east end is spiced with real life restaurants that provide more genuine service and inspire a lot of customer loyalty. I miss this.

7 Numbers features an approachable Italian menu that doesn't try to convince you of it's authenticity by using gratuitous Italian language (let's be honest, most people may understand a bit, but the menu shouldn't be about confusing people). Instead, at this lovely corner restaurant, you are treated to great friendly service, delicious Italian food and a wine list that is to be commended, not only for the selections, but the approachable, well written tasting notes and decent prices.

We started with the polenta and sausage. My friend isn't big on polenta, but we agreed that this dish really was special. The polenta was slightly crispy and held up well against a zesty crumbled sausage ragu. You should try this.

The linguine with mushrooms and truffle was prefect. Al dente noodles with tender mushrooms dressed in just the right amount of truffle oil with a shaving of parmagiano reggiano. Rich, but heavenly.

I'm also in love with the vegetable sides. We had the asparagus and the rapini and both were cooked perfectly to let the flavours shine.

7 Numbers definitely has more of that charming mom and pop feeling that is being killed off slowly in the west end. If you're in the mood for some satisfying food, excellent wine and genuine hospitality, check out 7 Numbers.  It's the real deal."}
{"text":"Excellent night. I've been twice, once with a friend and once with my boyfriend. On both occasions service was excellent and the food divine. Dishes are shareable and can give you the chance to taste more on the menu. The meatballs were amazing as was the calamari. I strongly  recommend this place."}
{"text":"7 Numbers is a nice family run place with no grumpy members who looked like they felt obligated to work there. Everyone was smiling and friendly.

The kitchen is open so you get to see some of the food on the menu and it makes the place smell delicious.

Sexy duck was good. I had the rabbit stew but wouldn't do it again because the bones were still in the meat and I was pulling out a bone every 20 seconds.

The spicy veal was probably the top choice of my friends that night and it really did have a kick to it.

Ask for their spicy oil to put on things. It's home made and delicious if you can handle a little kick."}
{"text":"Food delicious! Hence the two stars. 
Service - terrible. Waiter had no idea what was in anything. Didn't even know what gin selection was. Worse - didn't even offer to find out. 
Also - what's up with the lousy menu print job? Step it up folks."}
{"text":"I have not been tot he Eglinton location, so I had nothing to compare to. I had my birthday dinner at 7 Numbers, and there were 11 of us. It's little tight for a party that size, but the ambiance was beautiful. I loved the vintage family picture all around. It was very cozy. Our server was also pleasant and patient, as you can imagine how indecisive a group of 11 can be. 

The family style dinner had incredible value, unfortunately not many people wanted to go for it on our table. I had the lamb, and it was fall off the bone delicious. I tried some sexy duck-leg also, and it was moist and flavourful. I wasn't a huge fan of the sides, but they worked well with the mains. The drink menu was also very impressive. 
I will definitely be back, but with a smaller group next time."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either. 

Cutely decorated with odd bits and ends splayed around the space like license plates, famous celeb photos etc. Tables are crowded into another so you would have to not mind sitting next to your neighbours directly though there a few tables that are seperated off from the long rows of tables. I went to 7 numbers a few years ago at the original location on Eglinton and remember having a highlight lasagna with a very great tomato sauce. Sadly this is no more or did not at least translate over to the Danforth location, the version I tasted recently was only a few notches above what chef boyardee's pasta. 

Come here if you want passable italian cooking at good prices in a boisterous, campy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner with some friends. I couldn't make a reservation as the place only accepts them for parties of six or more, but no issues getting a table at around 7pm. We decided to opt for the family style option at $34 bucks each. This option as explained to us by the server would provide enough portions to ensure no one left hungry. We received four apps (picked by the chef), three pastas, and our choice of the main (each diner got to pick their own. They also provide a couple of sides for the table along with the mains. 
We also ordered an organic merlot/Shiraz for $49 bucks--poor choice. 
The apps arrived-calamari, arugula salad, warm mushroom salad, and a burrata. All were tasty and while they looked small, they sure hit the spot. Calamari was delish and fresh.
The secondi or pastas were spaghetti, orecchiette, and a messy looking lasagna. Two of the three pastas were a little too al dent and the lasagna was the favorite of the three. We couldn't finish them-getting full! 
I ordered the lamb shank, it came on its own and was a bit dry. We also had meatballs as another main and they were moist but SALTY. The other main was the trout in puttanesca and again over salted. Our side was a simple asparagus and nothing else. No desserts were ordered as we were full.
Final verdict: I would come back but not in a long time, there are too many better options for Italian in our city. The food was good but no wow factor. Their wine selection could really be improved by having a few better options at a lower price point. Definitely drop the organic wine option!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in this place and awesome service. Small, but in a cozy way. Didn't seem like there were many tables for two except for a barstool-like long table section, but a good amount of tables for 4 or more. There was a miscommunication with the reservations but still got seated right away thanks to our very friendly waitress. 

Prices are reasonable and I love the small plate options. Appetizers are a little small for the price though, but good quality. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food. Nice beer available. Love that they left a container of cheese on the table to put on our pasta ourselves. 

Definitely would go back and suggest others try them out."}
{"text":"I was visiting for a concert and needed a place to eat. I wandered in 7 numbers and right away one can not help notice the pleasant atmosphere. 
The staff kindly greeted me and accommodated me as a solo dinner. I know my placement kind of hindered their routine but I was greatly appreciated it. Each member of the staff I encountered were so friendly that that  alone will make me return more often. 
Now onto the food. . . . Each item I had was well prepared, well plated and the taste was excellent. Flavors were subtle and not over powering. I do look forward to returning so to enjoying more that the menu has to offer. 

Go for the staff, enjoy the atmosphere and return for the food."}
{"text":"I really like this place. 

I've been a few times and it's a breath of fresh air amidst a backdrop of just o.k. Greek restaurants in Greektown. 

The location is small and cozy. Reservations are recommended from Thursday through the weekend, but otherwise no problems getting a table. 

It's Italian tapas-style menu is also really interesting and it changes from day to day, depending on what's fresh and in-house, not what's frozen in the basement and can be easily deep fried. 

They have a lovely selection of wines, from reasonable prices to much, much more expensive choices and the servers are casual, laid back and know their stuff when it comes to the menu. 

When my Husband and I went, we ordered a few of the day's specials, including deep fried ricotta cheese topped with marinara sauce, a nice orrichiete pasta dish and a beet salad. And we were full. If you eat slowly and breath between bites, you might find that tapas style food will fill you up. People in Europe are thinner than us for a reason. 

They also offer, for the meat-a-tarian, an interesting, ever-changing selection of meat dishes- think osso bucco, quail, lamb, etc. Not your average Italian restaurant offering up veal or chicken options. 

And to top it off, the prices are reasonable, when you consider the quality ingredients, the freshness and the fact that Mama herself (no lies) is cooking up your orders in the kitchen. I've seen her at both locations (there is another on Eglinton West) and she makes my heart melt."}
{"text":"This location is not as superb as the eglinton west location.  Menu was severly limited (3 pasta choices - lasagne only meat option for pasta) zucchini side was 5 tiny pieces -- not expecting 5 zucchinis or anything but c'mon, that's not a side )  
 Staff were lovely and food was great (definitely delicious). But do urself a favour and go to other location"}
{"text":"I've heard sooooooooooooooo much about this restaurant before I got here finally.

So my experience will be quite different from a regular person's visit because my brother rented out most of the restaurant for his birthday bash (about 60 people) so things I can't comment on are price and aspects of service. 

First off, the place is sooooo cute. Loved every aspect of the actual restaurant. The servers were suuuper nice, the place was decorated really quirky and inviting, and you could tell that everyone working here looked really happy.

We had a special family style dinner for the party, in a few rounds

ROUND 1 Salads

1. Arugula with Goat Cheese and Walnuts- So good. I love arugula and goat cheese.
2. Spinach with Goat Cheese and Roasted Red Pepper - Again really good.
3. Tomato with Bocancini - The tomatoes were well seasoned, and the bocancinis were fresh. Weirdly no one at my table really liked the bocans., so i ended up with most of them, SCORE.
4. Italian Bread Salad - THIS WAS SO GOOD. I've never actually had anything like this before. Chunks of bread, with tomato, zuchini, turnips tossed in olive oil and something, really really enjoyed it.

ROUND 2 

1. Calamari Fritti - This was good. Large chunks of calamari served with lemon wedges. I basically ate half the order. It was a touch overdone though, but suuuuuuuper tender. 


Round 3 - PASTA ON PASTA ON PASTA

1. Lasagna - HANDS DOWN BEST THING OF THE NIGHT. Ugh soooo good. I've never had a lasagna as good as this. Tender noodles, large chunks of meat, delicious sauce, ugh. SO GOOD.

2. Linguini with zuchhini and tomato sauce - really good, the sauce was amazing.

3. Rotini with wild mushrooms - Not my favourite of the night. I think it was a bit burtn, not sure.


Main Course:

We had a choice of their selections, so I got to try a bit of everyone at the tables.

1. Sexy Duck Leg -- I got this. Not going to lie, it was suuuuuuuuuuuper salty. Like woah. The first layer (skin and meat) was barely edible, but once I pulled it aside it was SO GOOD. But hard to eat at first.

2. The Spicy Veal Barriciola sp? - Veal rolled in nuts and stuff cooked in a tomato sauce. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TENDER. Ufff. Really good.

3. THe Lamb Shank - Huge, braised, and delicious. Serveed with peas. 


Sides:

1. Raddichio Salad - super bitter, but thats radicchio right?
2. Grilled Zuchinni - I LOVE grilled zuchinni. It's basically my favourite vege. And they did it perfectly. 


The service was great, considering they had to serve 60 of us at the same time. These guys would've owned the first service of hell's kitchen. All the food came out timely, and we were all fed together. It was a bit of a wait at first, but thats because people were late for dinner.

I will definitely be back, and I want to give the sexy duck leg another go!

Thank you so much 7 numbers for hosting my brother's birthday, ad you guys rocked! :)"}
{"text":"Insanely good food. Fantastic service. Very reasonably priced. Fun, buzzing atmosphere. Kid friendly. I've been a regular here for years and I can't say enough about it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

Went here to celebrate a project with a colleague of mine last night.  Let me tell you  we ate like kings.  We started with the Barrata and Grilled Squid, which were amazing!  the Barrata was served on top of sliced cantaloupe, side of mustard, and bread.  Everything worked well individually but together was magic.  it kind of reminded me of Nonna's (my girlfriend's Nonna but i consider her my own too) house when she served proschiuto with cantaloupe and boconccini....mmmm yummy.  The Grilled Squid was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  As our secondi we got Lasagna and i have to be honest Nonna makes the best lasagna hands down but this reminded me of it and if it can do that then i am truly satisfied. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly, no complaints there at all.  As a primi we decided to order the Baseball Cut Steak and Arctic Char.  I preferred the char more because i can get a steak anywhere to be honest.  Now what got me with the char was that it did not remind me of Nonna's but instead my Mommas.  She used to make fish and have this tomato topping just like Seven Numbers.  i was thoroughly impressed with this resto from its decor, staff, and food.   It's definitely a resto i will come to more often because it felt nostalgic eating there and not to mention the girl working there was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy Italian cuisine if you are either home sick or just want some quality food that reminds you of you family.  Ask them for the chilies in oil if you ever go...amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I have ever given 5 freaking stars. It certainly freaking deserves it. I've been to both 7 Numbers location and they are equally worth a trip if you love A.) Amazing, truly amazing Italian Food B.) Enjoy Excellent Value C.) Like the old Italian Restaurant Style and D.) Are not a jerk.

Each time I've been to this restaurant the staff have been superb and I've had the family style meal where they bring out fantastic recommendations for each course. Wine was outstanding too. I've been for a work function and for pleasure and each were pleasurable. 

Also....as a side note - the last time I was there they were also playing this tune. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3bRCLStkOM

Listen and you will understand that to be sitting enjoying top notch food and wine and have this come on would make any human's night. Well done team. Everyone else, eat here quick!!!

P.s. Have the meatballs. They are to die for."}
{"text":"Like most things on the Danforth, 7 Numbers is overrated. Good service and atmosphere, but there's much better food in the city. It isn't tapas. It's imperfect comfort food. Probably best on a really cold day after you've been active."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a great home style meal with a few people or a huge group of people. You feel welcome and each dish is made with love and care.

The prosciutto salad is fresh and the burrata is creamy and flavourful. The veal meatball is HUGE and perfect for sharing. We ordered a few of sides including spicy cauliflower and Grilled zucchini. My only complaint is that for $5.50, we got 5 half slices of grilled zucchini... I felt it was not worth the price at all.

The sangria came in a vey cool flask like jug and the juices were bold and enlightened my taste buds!

To end, the tiramisu was creamy and rich, and met my expectations and more! The service was friendly and the atmosphere was lively.

The menu can change on a nightly basis and they cook with good ingredients so you can always check their website for new updates... That's what I did :)"}
{"text":"Mixed experience.  On a cold night, we came in and had such a warm greeting from the guy hanging around the front. He set us up with a nice table after a couple minutes wait. 

Then our server came on the scene - she seemed nice ... but later started vanishing or long gaps of time. Brought white wine instead of red (but switched it no problem). Never brought the second round of drinks. The bill took LONG to arrive and then had a mistake. 

But then again, the food (giant squid starter, steak, duck, fish, etc) was delicious. 

I might return - it was cozy and the food was good, but it's that way at plenty of other places."}
{"text":"The place uses paper as table cloth, and the portions for the duck was very small. I was not impressed. I will not return. Bathrooms are too cold. Chairs are better suited for a 1960's disco club."}
{"text":"My steak was absolutely delicious but I was in the mood for pasta and was very very disappointed. I do not eat veal and I hate mushrooms; all 3 or 4 pasta dishes contained either of the 2. I just wanted a nice tomato sauce. The place is also quite loud. I will not be going back I can get a great steak elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible Service.  Smell like a kitchen walking out.  Decent food.  Not sure I would go back , there are better options on the Danforth."}
{"text":"A couple of friends held their birthday party here and I have to admit that it is a pretty cool venue. While I'm not the biggest fan of dimly lit restaurants, this place can pull off the dim-romantic vibes without impairing the ability to dissect the food you ordered.

I sank my teeth into the Lamb Shank (garnished with green peas), which was 10/10 amazing. The meat was fall-off-the-bone and tender as can be, only wished the portion was bigger. A couple of friends ordered the Sexy Duck Leg, which was an attention-grabber from the menu and equally well-received taste wise. Waiter was also very friendly, which added to the great experience here."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place via BlogTO as one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto and had been eager to try it. I live near the Danforth, but never would have known where it was if I hadn't been looking for it. 

It is pretty small inside. We were seated near the front of the restaurant, and being a cold night, I had to keep my coat on. The lighting is dim and there's lots of big candles, which I liked. 

Unfortunately, we were there at the end of the night, and I felt we were largely ignored while the staff was focused on closing down. The pace of service was quite slow, and there were a number of times I was hoping for a while someone would come over.

I had the Winterlicious menu, and my hubby had something else. Everything I had was okay, but nothing really stood out. My hubby was pretty upset that he ordered the duck and they were out. Instead he got the lamb and found it lacking in finesse. Whole it was braised well, it was covered in large chunks of rosemary and sitting in a bed of its own grease. I had the rice balls, lasagna, chickpea mash, and the apple caramel cheesecake. The food was lacking in seasoning overall. The lasagna had enough cheese to make me reasonably happy, but it was very sloppily presented. To be honest, the cheesecake was probably the best part.

It would have been nice to find good Italian on the Danforth, but unfortunately, it was not what I was hoping for. I certainly won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"This is a very decent Italian restaurant on the danforth, and unlike Il Fornello or Libretto, it doesn't focus on pizzas.  I had the Polpetti di Rosa, wonderful meatballs in marinara sauce and my girlfriend had the lasagna.  Both were very good and tasty, not the high-cuisine kind of tasty, but more of the homemade-comfort-food tasty.  We also had the calamari for appetizer which were quite good, but nothing out of the ordinary (for the Danforth, where calamari are amazing everywhere).  

I would definitely come again here, when in mood for homemade italian comfort food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to 7 numbers for years, the food has always been consistently great, the atmosphere is casual, fun and welcoming. We've had romantic dinners, family functions and work parties. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious southern Italian fare. Incredible and friendly staff. Adorable atmosphere. We especially loved the mid-nineties gems they were playing (Primal Scream! EMF! The The!-so good). We shared a risotto pescatore that absolutely melted in your mouth. So many options for antipasto. The desserts were all mouth-watering from flourless chocolate cake to key lime pie to Nutella tiramisu. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Always disappointing to decide on a spot for dinner to find they do not take reservations for groups smaller than 6. We arrived early enough to get a table right away but, we were seated very close to the front door and our table was interrupted throughout the meal by guests waiting for a table. 

We have visited several times and the food is usually very good. Last night, service was slow. Cocktails/wine/after dinner drinks especially. I guess the bar was overwhelmed. Food was inconsistent: Octopus/shrimp tasty and tender, linguine was almost warm and mushy; eggplant lacked flavour and texture. Espresso martini -- delicious. Too bad it was the last thing to arrive at the table (desserts and coffees were ordered at the same time and those came right away). 

Not in a hurry to get back there."}
{"text":"Went here last summer and found the food very good.  The prix fixe was great, good variety and very high quality and very value priced.  If a dining experience was only the food, this place would get five stars.  There was nothing that wasn't high quality and well prepared, but I must say however I won't be going back as I found the staff to be rather arrogant and rude, not to me but to my dining companion.  

Most of the reviews talk about the friendliness of the staff and the homey feel of the place, this was not something I experienced, sadly to say."}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicous. arancini we're still frozen inside. Chicken Marsala was average. Potatoes servers with entree were stale. All desserts are outsourced."}
{"text":"The Italian word for grandmother is \"Nonna\" and being raised by a Nonna, you realize there's nothing like Nonna's home cooking...it's a tall order, but this comes close. 

7 Numbers is a nice place for family-style Italian food. Our group came here for dinner on a busy Saturday night and ordered the family-style dinner, drinks and a couple bottles of wine. We were quite impressed with the attentive service, wine list and the romantic candlelit ambiance.

We enjoyed sampling the entire list below which, by the way, would've made Nonna proud. 

--Antipasti --

Insalata di rucola - Organic Cookstown arugula with local roasted bell peppers and goat cheese

Sardine - Grilled, deboned Sardines served with Salsa Verde

Caprese heirloom tomatoes drizzled in Tuscan olive oil and topped with buffalo mozzarella 

Calamari - Pan fried New Zealand squid served with lemon wedges.

--Primi --

Lasagna home-made with ricotta and spinach

Penne Amatriciana with Peccorino, Prosciutto, tomato and onion

Linguini with rapini and fresh tomatoes

--Secondi--

Parmigiana di melanzane con sugo - pan fried eggplant with Romano cheese and tomato sauce

--Contorni--

Grilled Zucchini 

Insalata Italiana - mixed greens with a red wine vinaigrette"}
{"text":"After my friends raved about the lasagne, I finally had the chance to dine here the other night. We started off with the caprese salad. I will admit that it was quite good. The mozzarella was excellent and the basil and heirloom tomatoes were very fresh and flavourful. I expected better bread and olive oil that was served with our appetizers, but I can't really complain.

The lasagne: the noodles are fresh, the veal was very tender, and the sauce was mild. However, it was incredibly under seasoned. I don't believe that one should ask for salt unless you are at a horrible chain restaurant like East Side Marios or Olive Garden. However, the lasagne really lacked seasoning. The sauce was also very oily. There was a residue of oil around my lasagne. It was not olive oil--it was grease. The only reason why I know that was because I decided to pack up my lasagne and put it in the fridge. The next day, I took it out for lunch, and the grease had solidified. I can understand if it were a bolognese, and it had that very rich and fatty sauce, but this is not one of those sauces.  To be frank, I had better elsewhere, and even worse, I had better frozen lasagne.

The service was lacking also. There was only one other table, and the waitress did not check up on us. I don't think that I will return.

I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to 7 Numbers on a friend's recommendation.  It's Italian tapas style dining.  The interior was eclectic, with old records and memorabilia on the walls, but warm and romantic.  When we walked in, the music was quite nice, but as the evening progressed, it got worse.  By the end of the meal, it was obscure and beat driven, which seemed out of character.  

We had been told that the serving staff was quirky and interesting.  Our server were difficult to communicate with (didn't seem to understand some of our requests or questions), and offered little advice or recommendations on the menu, which was not as original as I had hoped.  Only a few of the dishes sounded interesting.  

As the food arrived, I found that most of the dishes were under-seasoned; the tomato and bocconcini salad came with only two very tiny basil leaves, large unripe (and therefore tasteless) tomato slices, and was drizzled with only olive oil.  That being said, the quality of the cheese was creamy, fresh and fantastic.  The blackened cod was nothing special, paired with a sauce that was too strong for such a mild fish, and the portion was quite small.  Maybe instead of changing the menu selections every day, as they boast, they should find a few dishes that they are actually really good at, and stick to those.  

In my opinion, the highlight of our meal was the fresh bread served at the beginning, which we dipped into oil and balsamic made available on each table.  That's not saying much."}
{"text":"Great value restaurant. the feel of great home cooking. I've eaten here over a dozen times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"7 numbers is a great Italian restaurant that serves food to share. I think this is a great concept for a group of friends. The staff are very friendly and it has a family feel to it. The one on  eglinton also does cooking classes with 'Nonna' one monday every month. Prices are pre fix for groups if you want ($27 per head or +$4 for a steak from the same placed sourced by Barbarians). The pre fix menu brings out appetizers to share for the whole table, then three different types of pasta for the second course (their veil lasagna is to die for) and then you choose your main carne course, and they will bring out a vegetable and salad platter to share. Well worth it, and it makes drinking without a care even mroe fun because hey, you've only spent $30 on dinner. 
Make a reservation before hand if you can for a group. I go back repeatedly because the food is amazing and the service is great too. It's refreshing in Greek town and the servers are just fun and honest. The owners are often in the store and the son runs the danforth locaiton and is very friendly as well. There's is just something nice about a family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good but not great!

I had the dinner size Linguine with dandelion greens and roasted tomatoes and a side of the grilled rapini. The pasta was somewhat bland (others at my table ordered the same dish and had the same complaint), and I could not taste any hint of roasted tomatoes, tomatoes yes, roasted no. Maybe their meat dishes are better. Also I don't like being offered cheap parmesan cheese for my pasta...the real stuff or nothing!

Others really enjoyed their dishes. I will be back again (probably the eg location) to try out their other dishes! 

Very friendly staff and nice ambiance. Decent sized front/side patio. 

Also huge wine list that intimidated me :("}
{"text":"I have to review this place, not only to rebut the poor reviews but, to rave about the amazing family style dinner my girlfriend and I had.

The atmosphere is casual but elegant, and always candlelit after dark; wax runs down the wine bottle candle holders.

We ordered family style and what an experience! They choose all items except for the main, where we ordered a whole Rainbow Trout. This is for the patient and hungry! The first course was perfectly ripened tomotoe with bocconcini cheese, green beans and fresh beets and grilled calamari. The next course included three pasta dishes: lasagna, spiced shelled pasta with capers and olives and an angel hair dish done mediterranean style. Then there was salad, grilled asparagus and, of course, the grilled fish, baked to perfection. 

The service was excellent.

I can say no wrong.

Excellent value too at $27 per head.

All the best, and enjoy."}
{"text":"I will say that I went when I wasn't feeling so well (it was a bday dinner) so I can only tell you a little bit of what I ate. I had the \"sexy duck leg\" and it was a meat that melted in my mouth. So succulent and juicy.... Wow. Also it was my first time eating radicchio - it looked like purple lettuce but thicker. Not a fan of this vegetable. It was bitter and I really wasn't expecting that. People did say this is what the vegetable usually tastes like so that's no fault to the chefs. $18 

My friends all enjoyed the penne and the apps (calamari, rice balls and burrata). Again my stomach couldn't handle it but they cleaned up the plates! 

Great ambience. Friendly staff. Food coming out was a little slow but it happens when it's a Saturday night.

Oh, and get the key lime pie. Damn it was good."}
{"text":"With the vast selection of greek restaurants on the Danforth, I didn't expect to find such a great italian restaurant. 

From the moment we walked in, you could tell there was a distinct character about this place. We were greeted by Victoria, who was expectional and courteous in everything she did. Initially we were seated in the back, it was poorly lit back there (good for a romantic date) but not for a party of five.:). We were promptly moved up to the front of the restaurant.

As mentioned in other reviews, the IPAD contains the menu, which is the first time I have seen that used. I thought it worked quite well, the downside is that we had to pass it around so that everyone could see what was on the menu. However, just look at the walls and the menu is listed there also ( not easy to read however!). It was quite loud, and it was hard to talk to someone sitting across from you.

The food was very fresh and very simple. We have friends who were vegetarian, and Victoria was very helpul in them deciding what to get. I  got the Lamb Shank, which was good, I have tasted better. The Sexy Duck leg was also very tender and tasty. We also had a side dish of rapini and zuchini very good.

Next time I gotta try the lasagna!

The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Their family style meal is amazingly well valued. $28 a person for 3 salads, 1 calamari, 3 pastas, and a main for each person with veggies served alongside. The Eglinton location has better food though!

Come before 6 or it'll be packed!"}
{"text":"I had the lasagna and key lime pie. Both were really good  and I would definitely come back for the same meal. The staff were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The food is soooo mediocre and over salted. they have you squeezed into a space and rude service staff.  Tried couple times and just have to say they have to get over themselves. pass it by."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. A dark and inviting atmosphere. It was fairly busy when I went. Some of the tables didn't look as comfortable as the one I was seated at, so my review may have been poorer if I were seated elsewhere."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a family style dinner here with a large group. I highly recommend doing the family style in a large group. The assortment of apps and salad plus you get to pick your individual main is awesome.  I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is authentic, delicious, quaint, fun and quirky. Where rustic tables, iPad menus and the worlds largest (and greatest) meatballs collide in perfect harmony with a rockin' soundtrack.

They have some bad-ass old school cocktails with some new world twists, and a wine list that would thrill anyone - wankers not included. 

I was there with a large group, and they basically kept bringing us the best of the best. If you ask your server to just surprise you, you won't be sorry. Also, for what it is, this place doesn't break the bank and the servers are honest folk who won't just bring you the most expensive things on the menu.

And seriously... get the meatballs... with the wine."}
