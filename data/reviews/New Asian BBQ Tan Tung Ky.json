{"text":"This place is called New Asian and it's sister location is on Jones and Spring mountain. Just let me tell you we reserved a table for 13 people and we got our table. Mind you it's a new restaurant. So we ordered 9 things. Peking duck, green beans, beef chow fun, Chinese meatloaf, beef brisket hot pot, and a few other things. The food came out slow and had no taste. Not everything came out some things weren't even placed. My guests were not happy neither was I. I had to fill my own tea pot cause these people don't know what they are doing. Save yourself and don't eat here."}
{"text":"This is a sister restaurant of Tunc Ky on Jones Blvd. That restaurant has a 4+ star rating on Yelp and very rightly deservedly so. 

This restaurant opened up on 6/1/18. My wife and I went there on 6/2. There were many on the wait staff and they were all running around with their heads cut off. Food service was slow, some dishes were OK, some not terribly good. I figured that this is a \"new\" restaurant symptom. 

This evening, 6/10/18, we decided to give it another try. Since their sister restaurant caters mostly Cantonese style noodle dishes and BBQ Pork ( Char Siu ) type of food, we were hoping that this place will offer some real Cantonese/Chinese dishes. 

Boy, were we disappointed. First of, we ordered a live Crab dish for US$45. The order went in and a few minutes later, the waiter came and advised us that today, they have run out of live crab. Can't they go next door/across the street to the super market to buy some live crabs??

Then we wanted a steam fish. The only sea water live fish they have is about 3+ pounds. At $33+ a pound, for the two of us, that is way too much. So we declined.  

We ordered three dishes total:

Vegetable Chow Mein - a pure F.  Portion is small and virtually there is no green vegetable, only mushrooms and sprouts. Worst of all, it is totally TASTELESS. 

Beef Brisket in Curry Sauce in a clay pot - the sauce has good flavor. But the brisket is not tasty - I suspect that they braised the brisket first and then cooked in a curry sauce. Not an ideal method. 

Three Treasure on a sizzling platter - the  only dish that I can rate a A- for taste. But the plating and the dish presentation is awful. Without biting into the food, I cannot tell what is what, is it a tofu with meat?? or an eggplant with meat?? 

Pricing for this place is quite upscale. These three dishes together were over $55. Many other local Chinese restaurants would charge less. 

One thing is for sure, if I want to have Wonton soup, Porridge, Chow Fun or Chow Mein, I would not come here. I will go to the old Tunc Ky on Jones.

Personally, I haven't given up on this place. I will wait for a month or so and try them again for some seafood.  Hopefully by that time, they may have their stuff together."}
{"text":"The food items are pricey! And the taste is just a okay or below average for the price I pay. 
The decorations are good though but the food was overly salty. Was there great discounts on salt where they get their shipment from? Cos I need to stock some salts in my kitchen too.
It was also funny seeing the chef wearing his medals when he's walking around, is that allowed in the kitchen? Or is that just for show? 
Lastly, we have a party of 5 and they force charged the 15% tips on our bill. 
Definitely going back to the old location for more quality and cheap food."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before coming to this place.  Like other said, this place is way over priced with the quality.  We got the fried rice and it's not tasty at all.  The soup noodle was soggy.  We got one of the appetizer for $9, it only have a few pieces and you could tell they just put it out from freezer and seeing you the part with frosting bite.  If they didn't have a signing saying Grand Opening, I thought that place has been there for a long time as the decoration was like being in 80s.  Definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"I usually go to the original Asian Bbq location for my takeout, but I finally decided to try their new place after driving past it so many times. Grand opening was on June 1, and my first impression observations are listed below.

Pluses:
-Larger parking area
-Same good-tasting Chinese Bbq
-Spacious and clean interior
-Friendly Chinese hostess who can also speak English
-I saw mostly Asian people dining inside (which usually implies that the food is authentic)
-Accepts credit card

Minuses:
-High prices
-High prices that are higher than the sister location
-Higher prices, especially for common dishes that would probably cost several dollars less at other Chinese restaurants in the same area
-Uh, did I mention high prices? If it's going to be pricey, then I expect fantastic food not just average or above average value for my hard-earned cash.

All I ordered was a whole duck ($28), 1 lb of roast pork belly ($18), 1 strip of Bbq pork ($7), and 1 Salt-N-Pepper pork chops ($15), and I was more than a little stunned when I saw the bill. My takeout was for 4 people, but geez, I can maybe understand spending $73 for dinner but not for lunch! The food I ordered was delicious though, and their service was fine. However, if I can get the same roast duck, pork belly, and Chinese bbq pork at the original location for less, I think I'll continue to head over there for my to-go orders and only come to the New Asian Bbq if I feel like splurging for an occasional eat-in experience. I was torn between giving them a 3 star instead of a 4 star, but their prices are the only reason why I would be reluctant to return, so for me, deducting just one star feels fair enough."}
{"text":"Me, my cousin, and my brother decided to try Asian BBQ's second location located at Decatur and Spring Mountain (across from small SF Supermarket). We came in for lunch on June 13, 2018 around 2 p.m. We were of course greeted and saw some familiar employees from the first Asian BBQ.

It took us a couple of minutes to decide what to order because there were two menus, the \"Lunch Menu\" and the \"Whole Day Menu.\"

We were kind of shocked not only they have bbq but they served many different kinds of seafood and they have chinese cuisine but disappointed some of the items were unavailable.

We ordered:
- Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice
- Wonton Noodle Seafood
- 3 BBQ Combo (We got Roasted Duck, Roasted Pork Belly, and BBQ Pork)

The food tasted good and no complaints about the service. All the servers were nice and friendly to us and got us what we needed while we were there."}
{"text":"I came this restaurant last month, but I saw a Cockroach on my Vegetable Dish ;  So I'm very disappointed, I'm not going there anymore!!! Ok"}
{"text":"I waited 2 weeks after their grand opening to try this place out, cause usually the first weeks can be chaotic and you're not going to get good services or quality foods.  I love the foods at their original restaurant (Asian Bbq and noodle) but I stopped going there cause the parking is a bitch, and the restaurant is so small that I feel like I'm maneuvering through a maze of cramped tables and people just to get some roast duck. With this new location, the parking is decent, but then again, I went at a time that was after the lunch rush and way before dinner time.  The inside is so much bigger and spacious for you to move about. The best part? The roast items are in the front, right when you walk in the door. Now, I can come in, order take out ,and wait for my order to be ready without getting in the way of the servers. Let's get to the foods. I looked at their all day menu (same offerings from original location plus seafood) and it was so much that it overwhelmed me. There were dishes I've never even heard of but it looked yummy though. They had a section with dim sum items, but that was X off. I'm assuming they will offer it later on once they work out the kinks of being a new restaurant. Since I was there for lunch, I ended up getting my usuals. The foods were still amazing as the first location! The service was amazing as well. The servers were very attentive and would occasionally come by to ask if we needed anything, which I find to be rare in most asian restaurants.  Overall, I'm very happy to be able to have Tung Ky foods again. Restaurant is big, clean, with decent parking and service is awesome.  I will definitely come back for dinner to try their seafood dishes.
*This place accepts credit cards, whereas the other is cash only. The business hours posted on door currently is 11am-11pm."}
{"text":"Really expensive.  Decent cantonese style food.  But i really wouldnt go back again since there are so many other choices and competition out there for chinese food thats similar and/or better wirhout feeling stiffed with the bill on a bad date.  do not \"wok this way\"."}
