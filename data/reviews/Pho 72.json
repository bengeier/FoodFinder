{"text":"Finally a place on the east end of Markham to satisfy pho cravings.  HOUSE SPECIAL BEEF PHO - the broth is very beefy and borderline too salty but the beef was phenomenal. It made me realize that I never actually pay much attention to the beef slices in pho but here I couldn't stop noticing. The brisket was juicy and overall a generous portion size. Beef balls look handmade and definitely smaller than the average mass produced variety; lacking in flavour.   BO BUN HUE - broth was too sweet and distracted from the dish  Service is wicked fast and seating is spacious. I'd definitely come back for the convenience of location and to try out their other offerings."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for dinner for the first time.  The food was delicious and the place was spacious.  We missed the place the first round because it is definitely not easy to spot.  It is right next to the Physio place.  It would be ideal if the restaurant sign is well lit to attract customers."}
{"text":"My go to when I am craving some authentic-ish Viet food in the Markham area!! Place is run by this really sweet lady who always greets me with a warm smile. Portions are quite big as well, always packs loads of meat. Definitely recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place and finally got a chance today. Ordered rare beef pho and beef tendon brisket as well as a side of the fried spring rolls.  Place is quiet and service is nice. Must say their soup base is pretty good and food was great. Definitely coming back here for more visits plus bringing friends to share the experience. Must try!"}
{"text":"What's better than a good bowl of hot Pho on a cold winter night?  That was exactly my thought when I came to visit Pho 72 near my house in East side of Markham. There are limited Vietnamese restaurants in the area (the next closest one is Castlemore and Bur Oak) so I was happy that we have one new place to go to.   Environment: From the outside, the restaurant looks very small and unappealing. But the space inside is actually very long, modern and bright. 3/5  Service: Our very young-looking server was attentive and polite. He was the only person working in the front on a Friday night. There were 5 tables that night. And he went around to serve each table himself while taking care of the cash register. The only problem was, he looks inexperience. So, you'll need to ask him for certain things that usually are there on your table, for example, napkins. Food also came very quickly. I gave this area a 3.5/5.   Food: The beef broth was okay, not the greatest. There was only 4 slices of beef on my pho and they were thicker and rougher than what you'd get from elsewhere. I did not like the texture of the beef balls that came with my pho as well. They were not \"bouncy\". I ordered the medium which was $8.99, and my husband (who's a big eater) got the large for $9.85. The prices were higher than most Pho places I've been to in Markham. And the sizes for the medium and large were almost the same.   We also ordered the fried chicken from their menu that night. I was expecting a lemon grass flavoured  fried chicken as usually that's what Vietnamese restaurant usually serves. But here, their fried chicken was done in honey garlic. So that was a little different. The taste of the chicken was good, well fried. But I strongly believed that they used maltose instead of honey because it was EXTREMELY STICKY and kept getting stuck on our teeth. Not in between the teeth but actually ON the teeth. It was not a pleasant experience to have to constantly get rid of the sticky stuff on your teeth in every bite. 2.5/5  At the end of the meal, my husband still felt underfed and ended up grabbing a McD's from drive through. We'd much rather drive a bit farther for a better Pho."}
{"text":"Was super hyped to check out this new restaurant, and was not disappointed! The pho itself was good, with a not overly MSG filled, salty soup. The noodles came in a generous amount and were cooked to the perfect texture. What impressed me was the large quantity of meat and tripe. Having ordered the house special with tendon, tripe, beef balls, and rare beef, I could honestly say there was a large amount of each; contrasting a lot of other establishments that tend to stinge on giving meat, and subsidizing it with more noodle. I was also impressed with the quality and portion of the spring rolls, compared to many other pho restaurants, $4.45 can get you two well-packed spring rolls. The spring rolls were stuffed to the brim with lots of pork and large shrimps; something you don't see very often. As well, there was cucumber and pepper to accompany the lettuce leaves. However, I would recommend getting a large sized pho, as that portion was relatively small for the price of $9.95. Overall, a nice new establishment for pho in the east end of Markham! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is so closed to my house and I really wish it was good.  But it is just ok, the beef pho tastes fine, but there wasn't enough noodles (even I ordered large size), the beef portion is good. The rice portion is good but then the pork chop is so dry, it is like it was not fresh and from the day before.  Chicken tastes good.  The place is spacious and service is friendly.  I would go again if I want something close by home but definitely have other better Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"Phone 72 is relatively new and opened up in the vicinity of \"Brown\" cuisine. It's a nice addition compared to Bamiyan Kabob and Paramount which are in the same plaza. The great thing is that since this pho restaurant is new, everything is reaaallly clean and looks nice since nothing is worn down.   If you appreciate a clean pho restaurant this is the place. I wasn't disgusted with the washrooms and the tables didn't have that re-used hand wipe smell (*cough* looking at you pho 88).   The service was really good because it wasn't busy the last few times we went in  - they usually only have one server working for this exact reason.   ~FOOD REVIEW~  We tried Bun Bo Hue, the large house special pho, their spring rolls and a broken rice plate with steamed egg meatloaf (my favourite!).   1. bun bo hue  7/10 One of the nicer ones I found at phone restaurants. This place gave you a lot of fresh herbs and cabbage to go along side with it. The actual broth wasn't strong or that spicy but it was still tasty without having that super oilyness that usually associated with bun bo hue. If you like spicy, try this for a change instead of pho.   Portion size? This place gave ALOT of different cuts of meat and blood Jello and it was a huge size for me to conquer... Mind you it was above $10 so you are paying more for it than at other pho restaurants.   2. House special pho  The flavour was really light and the broth was clean which I appreciate a lot since I am northern Vietnamese. A lot of pho places have scum and fat still lying in the broth and this is typically how Southern Vietnamese prefer their pho but I was super pleased with the broth here!   3. Broken rice dish with chicken and steamed egg At the time I went their steamed egg meatloaf was fresh so I didn't have a problem with it smelling odd or tasting off like another commenters review. They gave you a decent portion size but remember you are paying a little extra for it. This dish was $12 I think.   4. Spring Rolls  The pro? You get four rolls for like $5.00. Most places only give you 2 rolls for $5.00. The rolls are slightly smaller than other places but it's still a good deal in terms of portion size. For taste? I thought they contained alot of vegetables which I was disappointed in. They looked very pretty and fresh tho - the spring roll wrapper looked like it was just fried for the first time. A lot of places will deep fry before hand and then freeze and then refry.    Overall impression? I would come here with my boyfriend because it is cleaner and a nicer environment. The alternative was pho 88 but I hate how filthy the place is. I would pay a little extra for the cleanliness, I trust their food to be a lot more sanitary than pho 88..."}
{"text":"I was driving past this plaza one day and out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of the word PHO. I got home and told my mom about this exciting news! We decided to try it out the next day and it was delightful! Judging by the exterior, it looks like a small place but it is actually quite spacious inside with a very clean modern design. I ordered the broken rice with grilled chicken and my mom got a medium bowl of rare beef pho. I have never tried broken rice before and I found that it had a nice bite to it with interesting textures; the grilled chicken was also juicy and flavorful. My mom really enjoyed her pho, she said the broth tasted homemade and was not overly salty.  The next day, my mom went again by herself (I missed out because I was at work). The day after that, we went again and my boyfriend came along as well! So yes....we are indeed big fans of this place! At that visit, my boyfriend and I both ordered pho and my mom ordered the vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and spring rolls. The beef in the pho was delicious, not chewy or tough at all, and the noodles were thin but did not break in the soup. My mom's vermicelli bowl was huge, more than enough for one person!   The average price per dish is ~$9, well worth it for the generous portions and good quality! Once word spreads about this new restaurant, it will pho sho bring in big crowds!"}
{"text":"Came to Pho 72 on a regular weekday for lunch. It's in the same plaza from Sunny Foodmart, so if you're on the way to grab groceries, might as well stop in Pho 72 for a bowl of pho.  There's parking on the outside, it's rarely ever completely full, but you might have to park a little further back. Pho 72 has a very small store front, but when you walk inside, it's actually quite long and impressive for it's size. There are tables on both sides offering very comfortable seating.  The menus were already all set on the tables, and we were seated immediately. For this restaurant, you have to write down the number and quantity of what you order (standard pho restaurants). Service was really fast and food came out fairly fast.  The Pho Beef noodle soups came in two sizes (medium for $8.75 and large for $9.85) for whichever bowl you ordered. We decided to get the medium. It was a standard medium compared to other pho places, it might even be compared to a small in a few places. The pho itself was okay. In my opinion, the broth wasn't hot enough, and the beef was a little rough (very lean instead of fatty).  We ordered one of the broken rice dishes too (they were roughly $10 for a plate). We got the broken rice with chicken and fresh non-cooked egg on top. The broken rice tasted really good and the chicken was really tasty too. I would have thought this was one of the better dishes, with the exception of the egg. For some reason, the egg tasted a little funny to me (my mom thought the egg was a little old and it had a funny odour to it). Maybe a cooked egg option would be ideal if I get it another time?  The spring rolls were standard, I was amazed that there was the option of 4 spring rolls, though it also made sense because these spring rolls were smaller than typical Vietnamese pho places.  Overall, the food was okay for me. I really enjoy pho places with hot broth and good meat. The egg also smelt a little odd to us, but maybe it's just this particular time that we went? It was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since it's new in the area. Was excited due to the many good reviews! But...was disappointed. Ordered the spring rolls, the stewed  beef noodle, special pho, and the phuc kien noodle. Broth for the pho was weak as was the broth for the phuc kien noodle. The stewed beef noodle was horrible. Spring rolls were awesome, but disappointed  that it wasn't the authentic rice paper wrappers.  All in all, service was excellent..but quality isn't the best."}
{"text":"Pho 72 is a new Vietnamese restaurant in East Markham (and it's probably the only one). It's certainly a decent option for people in East Markham craving Vietnamese without having to drive more.  Its situated in the Armadale square plaza across sunny Mart and is beside bulk Barn and a medical centre. It can be really easy to miss as the storefront is really narrow, however I was surprised to find the interior quite long as it stretches to the back.   There's a grand opening 15% discount at the moment and we were given two complimentary small spring rolls which we ordered anyways. That was a very nice gesture.  Initial reactions are that the prices were a tad on the higher side compared to other Vietnamese restaurants, but it was still cheap given the food landscape nowadays. We walked out stuffed having paid only $20 for two, it was definitely worth it.  The pho was quite decent. The broth could have been a tad more flavorful but it does the trick. There was a good amount of beef and I had no major issues with it. The broken rice was excellent, I don't know of many Vietnamese restaurants actually using broken rice so this was a nice change. The pork chop and chicken were grilled well and it was flavorful with the lemon grass. The spring roll was a tad underwhelming but still alright. It arrived piping hot and fresh. The spring rolls weren't salty enough even with the fish sauce and the filling could have had more veggies."}
{"text":"Relatively new to this plaza, Pho 72 is a family run Pho restaurant serving up some Vietnamese comfort food. Coming here for the first time, the venue is very spacious and clean.  Service is fast and friendly and they've got a good range of selections. 4/5.   After going to a handful of Pho- restaurants we had some expectations of what's expected.  We both opted for their classic Pho noodles with the FULL works along with an order of spring rolls.   Ordering a large bowl, I found their portions were not as big as other locations. As for the spring rolls, they were okay.  Initially they looked like the frozen ones you get at stores, but thank goodness they weren't. Secondly I found this place slightly pricier than the other locations I've been to.  Thirdly, their soup isn't as flavorful as the other locations I've been to.   Would I come back, probably not as there are other PHO restaurants around the area that I've still not tried."}
{"text":"The worst thing about eating a pho was getting it lukewarm and that was exactly what I got. I think they did not cook the noodles to order so everything became just lukewarm after adding in the bean sprouts and basil leaves. The broth was nothing special either.  The cut of meat they used was not that great, Most were not eatable (see pic). They used their own store made meatball too. They were not that good but not that bad either. Some would probably prefer the factory made ones just for the better texture alone.  There was not enough meat for sure. You are done with the meat about half way thru. Typically, you would still have meat in the last bite of the pho in the very good Vietnamese restaurants. For about $10 a regular pho, I found it not worth the money at all. Their location is at 14th and Markham Road. I think I will go back to the one at Finch and Markham Road if I have pho cravings again since they offer a better deal and use better quality meat there."}
{"text":"Wasn't truly impressed with this pho restaurant. Flavours weren't good and not anywhere close to other pho restaurants. Broth was not good at all and tasted like water with a bit of beef flavour.  Prices were a bit too expensive.   There was also only one server and once it became busy the server could not manage any more.   Would not come back at all"}
{"text":"Newly opened pho place located in 14th and Markham. The place is spacious inside. Nice, well lighted and comfy chairs. Fast service, we got all our orders under 10mins. The food is excellent, i ordered the pho special(large) for $9. The beef was tender, i like that it didnt have too much tripe(not a fan), generous amount of beef balls and the broth was good."}
{"text":"I recently found out about this place this month, and have visited it probably 4 times already. This is definitely in my Top 3 for Pho restaurants! The restaurant looks very small from outside, but the interior is clean and modern. The service and staff are friendly as well.   In terms of food, I've only ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls and the rare beef soup (I also add beef brisket to the soup for an extra fee). The meat and noodles are perfect all the time and you're given quite a generous amount. I've never had the problem of the beef being tough, chewy, or have that funky taste. So that's always great! The spring rolls are also delicious and crispy every time!"}
{"text":"This place is new, clean, good service, and pretty decent size dishes. I had the vermicelli dish and my husband the pho. We also shared a fresh roll. They were all pretty yummy however, for the pho, they could have given us a bit more toppings. My vermicelli was filled with meat and veggies (I ordered more veggies and less noodles) and it tasted on point! Must go back to try their rice dishes as they looked delicious from the table next to us."}
{"text":"Been to this spot 2 times so far and by far one of my favorites places for pho and Vietnamese good! The service is exemplary ! We have tried the rice dish in addition to the pho broth is amazing,chicken wings and so on are good as well. We will be back here more often. I only gave 4 stars since both times were there what we wanted was always not available so we had to make a change in what we had to order. Recommend both the fresh rolls and spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Great portions, lovely staff, and fresh ingredients. Probably one of the best Pho's I've had in a while. My family and I tried the beef pho as well as the seafood Pho. Both came with huge portions and a lot of meat/seafood!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5 Hidden in the plaza with Sunny Foodmart on 14th Ave. and Markham Rd. Sign was not veryapparent at night. So, look carefully to spot this place.  [SERVICE] - 3.5/5 Server was friendly, but forgot to bring napkins, and the sauce for my order.  [DÉCOR] - 4/5 Clean, looks bigger on the inside than outside, but eerily quiet at 7:00PM on a Friday night. Ihad to speak so softly because there was no white-noise or background noise to cancel out thesilence. The restaurant livened up a little later as more guests sat down for dinner.  [FOOD QUALITY] - 3/5 Average. Vegetables were fresh but meat-quality was mediocre.  [ORDER] - Grilled Chicken & Vietnamese Pork Sausage Vermicelli Bowl - $9.95: comes withlettuce, cucumber, mint, bean sprouts, homemade pickled carrots, dried shallots andtoasted peanuts. The toppings were fresh. Noodles were a little mushy and individualstrands stuck to one another. Grilled chicken was dry & pork sausage was not juicy. Iguess the only good thing is the quantity of food because this dish is bigger incomparison with other Vietnamese restaurants in the area  - Pho Tai (Rare Beef with Rice Noodle Soup) - $9.85: soup broth was too salty and tastedlike MSG, and noodles were not firm enough. Fortunately, the homemade beef ballswere soft & tasted pretty good.  [OVERALL] - 3/5 I had pretty high expectations for this place because of the hype. Sadly, I think the food was justaverage. The meat was not juicy enough, and noodles were too soggy."}
{"text":"Clean and beautiful restaurant even still need some more dercoration. I tried few different kind of food but I like its Pho the most. Good soup and fair price. Will stop by whenever I have chance!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Finally a decent Pho joint in this neighbourhood!   I had been here twice for their Pho House Special and really enjoyed my noodle soup both times. The beef broth might be on the saltier side but love the toppings. I found their medium size is just perfect for me.  My dining companion ordered their Grilled Pork Chop and Chicken with rice ($9.95). At this price point, I have nothing much to complain. The meat were marinated well and the side salad/veggie was also plentiful.  Is this the best Vietnamese place in town? Probably not.   Come to Pho 72 when you are in East Markham for your pho craving and you probably won't be disappointed.  The decor is clean and simple. Service is fast and friendly.  They really needs some more lighting at the storefront. I could not really find it the first time I was there till I read through some of the other Yelp's reviews!"}
{"text":"This place is a great Vietnamese option in the area. Do bear in mind that it is still relatively new so they are still just getting started. Some highlights during my visit was the service. They were very attentive and friendly which is something that I appreciate and often determines if I would be willing to return to a restaurant. The interior is really clean as well! The pho is really good. Fresh and not greasy at all with generous portion of toppings. Also ordered the rice & meat plates and found the portions generous and meat well seasoned. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Fast service.  Stroller friendly (didn't actually use one but it's very spacious).  Ordered pho noodles with cooked beef and beef balls. It was ok. The beef balls contains tendons (I personally prefer the ones that do not). The noodles are the thinner rice noodles. The soups was very salty which is pretty normal for pho places. I like to judge pho places by the amount of water I'm required to drink when I get home! This made me super thirsty afterwards!  We ordered spring rolls (fried). The filling was good but the wrap was hard.   Overall, not bad given that there aren't many pho places in east markham.  I would probably go again but try the rice!"}
{"text":"Got the pho with beef and tripe in L for $9.85. Beef was slightly rough which was my only complaint.  The decor and service was nice.  Tip: Try their spring rolls. They are big and delicious. - You may miss this place because their store sign doesn't light up at night. It is beside the dollar store.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"So mediocre, smallest bowl I ve ever seen for a large option, flavor of broth tastes nothing authentical."}
