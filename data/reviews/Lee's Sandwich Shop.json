{"text":"Excellent breakfast and cheap! Love the old school diner feel. Owner is extremely friendly and food was amazing. Going to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"I visited a friend of mine in Kannapolis for lunch and she said this is the place everyone has to try first. This is a typical small town favorite. When you walk in it is full of regulars! Which is always great but also a tad weird if you are an outsider.   The restaurant is small has less than 20 tables to sit at, but there is a breakfast bar area to sit at. The kitchen is wide open so you can see everything get cooked in front of you.   The prices are well priced! I ordered the Jr cheeseburger that came with fries for about $7. They have specials everyday. I went on a Thursday which was spaghetti and brisket specials. My friend got the spaghetti and she said it was very tasty! They have burgers, hot dogs, salads, BBQ, and more. Again, the menu it very typical small town diner, which I love!! All small town staples are always good.   For the service, it was fast but don't go in expecting 5 star politeness. These servers are used to their regulars and felt a little annoyed that I didn't know what I wanted right when I sat down. Our server was a tad pushy but the place was also packed! I don't want the comment on the service to make you not want to go. What else can you expect from a small down, super packed, small town restaurant. The cashier was super nice!   Anyway, coming from an outsider and not a regular I enjoyed my visit to this establishment! Great food and great price! What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I ate at Leigh's sandwich shop today for the first time in probably 20 years.  Boy was it good!  I got the Big Lee's burger cause I didn't realize how huge it would be.  SOO delicious!  I got it with mustard, chili, onion, slaw..yummy!  And onion rings.  The food was hot off the grill and service was friendly and quick.  I am going to make sure to put this back on my list of places to go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Breakfast time! Great little home town shop. Different special every day. All the regular hamburger and hotdog kind of food with great service and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good eats on the cheap. It's what I would refer to as a bit of a 'hole in the wall' which many old school diners are but it is so worth a try. I can only speak for breakfast. I had liver mush deep fried so it would be hard which is my personal preference. That was accompanied by two eggs scrambled with cheese, a biscuit and hash browns. I'm a southern girl so I had to wash it all down with sweet tea. The entire meal was delicious, staff was friendly and they had a 100 inspection score. I'll definitely return for breakfast and possibly try lunch since the burgers and dogs are supposedly some of the house faves!"}
{"text":"Lees has been the go to hamburger spot in Kannapolis for 3 generations now...this place is never a bad choice."}
{"text":"(Known as the Best burger in town for many, many years.) I lived in Kannapolis for 28 years before knowing it was there. (Tucked back off a side street is why). You'll get a warm welcome when you walk through the door by several smiling faces. I've never had any issue, other than getting a seat b/c it's packed. I'll order carry out before I let a crowd change my mind. Oh, and the onion rings are out of this world! I love this place!! Don't be weary b/c it's small and simple...the food and personalities will prove you made the right choice!"}
{"text":"Heard about Lee's through the grapevine and stopped in for lunch.  This is a down home locals restaurant with a lunch counter and table service.  First... I was greeted and served by an absolutely fabulous lady as we sat at the counter.  She was of that vanishing  breed that makes you feel like part of the family on first meeting.  All the staff were friendly and courteous.  We watch some very tasty looking burgers come off the grill, but elected to try the Philly Steak and the Spaghetti special.  The Steak was quite good, but might have been improved with the addition of Provolone cheese.   The spaghetti came with a nice house salad and several slices of Texas style garlic bread.  The sauce was tasty and thick with ground meat.  The pasta was a wee softer than I like, but for $7.00 I left happy and full. I will return when in Kannappolis next.  I want to try one of those burgers and am told this is the place for a good country style breakfast.  Check it out... Not fancy, but a great place to eat and catch up on the local gossip."}
{"text":"Nice little family diner. I ordered the Lee's Jr., which is a double cheese burger, and was amazed at how quickly it was served. At first I thought they had microwaved it, but I could clearly see the chef throw the burgers on the flat top. The burger was delicious. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The stretch from China Grove through Landis, and into  Kannapolis, and on to Concord offers a variety of locally owned, old school cafes, diners, and even the occasional drive-in. Guy Fieri could spend a month here, and still might not do the area  justice - this definitely is a \"Back To The Past\" area of the state.  This place is one of the older joints (been around over 60 years now), a truly quintessential, small town, Southern cafe - small, a little tired & worn looking, and usually crowded with locals - law enforcement, truckers, senior citizens, even a few suits. They serve all 3 meals except Sat when the close at 2 PM, and they're closed Sunday  The lunch and dinner fare is standard diner fare - burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, a few soup & salad choices, and a plate choice or 2, including Spaghetti. We tried the Cheeseburger and the Chili Dog, and both were superb, in fact I'd be hard pressed to name more than a hand full of diners in the entire state that serve a better diner style Cheeseburger or Chili Dog.  This is a destination place for those two items, and we'll be back - wouldn't mind having a go at that Spaghetti, as well."}
