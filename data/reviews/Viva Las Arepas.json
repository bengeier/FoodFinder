{"text":"Love the new location...much more comfortable, and will be even more so when the summer heat gets here.  Tried the ribs and the chicken and both were awesome.  One star loss for the fries which were a little oily and limp, and the black beans which were a bit dry.  But the ribs and chicken were worth coming back for again and again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I use to walk by this place. I come to Vegas once a year for Interbike convention and stay nearby.  I am going back 2 nights in a row. Seriously, If you want something different away from the strip, something more authentic then your typical casino restaurant, try this place out.   Owner is very nice and will help you choose the right dish."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for two days; we ate here twice. The food great, the service is efficient and accommodating. So glad we found it!"}
{"text":"It was our family's first time having arepas and it was delicious!  Great value too!  The sauces were tasty as well.  My kids couldn't get enough of the fried plantains.  We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"A little more then just 1 $ but worth it. I'm getting lectured by the misses for putting a review and eating at the same time. Can't stop either of them. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! This is definitely the place to go for delicious Arepas. I'm so happy that my friend insisted on going. I would have missed out for sure. My group ordered the Asada, chicken, and shrimp arepas. All were tasty. A must!"}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood fool you.. This restaurant has never let me down. The staff is beyond friendly and accommodating! And the food is so fresh and always amazing. If you haven't been you need to go."}
{"text":"Favorite food in Vegas. Everytime I have a friend visit from out of town, or if my friends and I are deciding where to eat, this is our go to place. I haven't tried anything bad there yet. And so glad that they have many vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best dining experience I have ever had in LV. There aren't too many places where the owner takes your order, gives his recommendations and serves you your food. The food was delicious and very inexpensive. We were stuffed for just over $20 for two of us. I highly recommend this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Glad I found them on yelp..  The Arepas are  just spectacular. The place is clean and fresh.   Amazing customer service.  We just wanted to try everything.  Definitely going back when we visit Vegas this September.   I thought I could have left my wallet there and called them after about an hour we've left. Even though they didn't have found it and were busy he checked the camas for me. He told me every step I took and he hoped I found it.   I didn't left it there and found it hours later but since it was the last place we've been I had to make sure. But the service was amazing. =D"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and it is amazing.  Super tasty street food that is priced right.  I've never had Venezualan food before, but on my third visit we talked to two venezualan guys who said that the food was very authentic.  We've tried the chicken and cheese, the pork butt and the garlic shrimp.  All of which were fresh and extremely flavorful.  The soursop juice is also quite tasty!  It's a great little local place, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Authentic arepas, they use \"PAN\" brand masarepa and the filling recipes are very much traditional Venezuelan style."}
{"text":"All sorts of awesome! The wood fire beef and chicken arepas are my favorites. Try the hot sauce, it's spicy without leaving your taste buds numb."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is delicious! Wood grilled chicken and ribs, mesquite wood to be exact. If you've never had bb cue smoked over mesquite coals, boy are you in for a treat!... you might actually ruin yourself for regular bbcue so be careful!  Very reasonably priced a half chicken with two sides is $9.99!  We came here yesterday after getting pedicures next door and we're back again today. Just a few short blocks down from the stratosphere... worth the drive from wherever you're staying in Vegas. The meat is lean and tasty! Venezuelan treat!"}
{"text":"The Reina Pepiada and Shredded Beef A+++++++"}
{"text":"Great fast food Venezuelan restaurant. It almost tastes like real Venezuelan food the way the make it in South America. I love the arepas and pabellon, the service it's fine."}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas is an inexpensive Venezuelan fast food joint in the slump lord part of the strip behind the Stratosphere! Arepas r like a healthier version of a hamburger. I was glad I finally had the chance to experience this fine long standing famous LV establishment. Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Que arepas tan deliciosas! Pura calidad y sabor. Me encanto este lugar. Tostones y empanadas ni se diga, con una rica agua de guanabana."}
{"text":"Every time I am in town will visit this restaurant. Second time and it was as good as the first. Arepas with chicken and guacamole is fantastic. Looking forward for my next visit"}
{"text":"Very clean establishment, the staff is very polite and the food is delicious.  Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I think this was the best decision I made while in Vegas. No, I know it was.  PLEASE IF YOU ARE VISITING, LEAVE THE STRIP TO COME HERE. It is so worth it. So cheese, delicious, filling, and very affordable. I had the black bean and cheese and threw a fried egg on it. It was AMAZING.  Unlike many arepas I've had before, these held their form, not crumbling away once filled."}
{"text":"I'd never had arepas before, so this was an exciting new experience for me. I had the beans and cheese and the cold chicken in mayo and they were delicious! The service was great, extremely friendly.  As others have noted, this is a stand by the side of the road, so don't expect a fancy dining experience. Do expect some of the best food and certainly some of the most friendly service you've ever encountered though.  If/when I'm ever back in Las Vegas I'll be sure to return to Viva Las Arepas. This is by far the best value for your money in town."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Arepas and they were great! The ambiance and the food were really good for this meat eater. My vegetarian wife did not fare as well. Although there were several options for her the food was just not that good.  The meat eater was very happy, the vegetarian not so much."}
{"text":"While outside appearances can be deceiving, the Carne Asada was quite good. Came across this location on a late Sunday evening. Was tender in some places, seasoned very well and had a hint of smoke."}
{"text":"The most perfect arepas I have ever eaten. Imagine: the wrapper bursting at the top with tender, gloriously seasoned meat, the crinkly paper made translucent and sticky by meat juices and oil... your mouth floods with saliva after taking that first bite. Each one is filling and delicious; I was full after one and a half, and for $5 a pop, that's a fantastic bargain for a fantastic dinner. If I could only go back again!   After eating here for dinner, I went back for breakfast: I didn't need to try any more restaurants in Vegas after finding this one."}
{"text":"This place is where you want to go if you love Arepas, tostones, and empanadas! Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly! Loved everything we've tried so far! Would like to try everything on the menu. I definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and didn't want to deal with the crowds and smoke at the casino restaurants.  I found Viva Las Arepas nearby.... and it's now my \"go to\" place for the next 3 months while I'm here.  I live in SoCal... and I thought King Taco was good.  This place rocks!!!!  OUTSTANDING food, great location, easy to find, and it's off the main strip away from all the traffic.  I'll be back tomorrow and the next day...and the next..."}
{"text":"Pricey but Hella delicious. You got to try these awesome food.  They are truly the bomb."}
{"text":"Totally overrated at five stars. Sorry people. It's only okay.  My cousin ate there a few nights ago and was totally wowed by it. He said it was amazing.   I, along with three other friends went there yesterday to check it out. Our togo order was totally f'd up and not in our favor. First of all the guy behind the counter said, don't worry, everything will be marked. Absolutely nothing was marked and we had to try and figure out what our orders were since they were all thrown together. Secondly, one of the sandwiches we ordered was missing...so we had to share what we had because it was too much of a pain in the ass to drive all the way back to make a stink.   On top of that, I personally thought that the food was a bit greasy. I didn't love it. My other three friends did like the food, but didn't really get enough to eat. Everyone was a bit disappointed. They're willing to try again and give them another chance. I will if I'm dragged along.  Overall, I would say there's a lot of unwarranted hype about this dirty little stand."}
{"text":"Went here today. Ordered one hot( bean and cheese w/avocado) and one cold( chicken, avocado, mayo and peas) both were pretty good.  Everything seemed clean and fresh.  Overall, I wasnt super impressed but what do you expect from a small kiosk.  Not bad if you need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Amazeballs. Wouldn't expect such good food to come out this area of town. They have a nice little patio also"}
{"text":"If there's one thing that makes me seriously consider moving back to Vegas, it's this place. Seriously. I'm obsessed. It's probably unhealthy how much I think about these arepas.  I found out about this place about a month before I moved out of Vegas and my one regret is not trying this place sooner. It's in a sketchy area, but it is SO GOOD. Everything is perfect. Every time I go home, I have to make a stop here and get way too many items and eat until I feel sick.  Sometimes, it can be a bit salty, but the arepa itself is pretty bland, so it's a good balance. Their yucca fries are heavenly, and so are their fried plantains. The wood-fire chicken is so smokey and tender, the pork was nice and juicy, the avocado sauce is perfectly creamy, ugh. So good. They give you two sauces; one's a spicier one and the other is a creamy cilantro I believe. I like to mix them and drown my arepas in them.   If you decide to go here, which I highly recommend and will be extremely envious about, be ready to waddle out the door. If you're anything like me, it'll be nearly impossible to choose one arepa to try and you'll end up getting 2 and an empanada (which is also delicious) and yucca fries. If you are able to have room for dessert afterwards (which I highly doubt), go next door to Art of Flavors. Another hidden gem that I'm obsessed with."}
{"text":"I had arepas from the food truck a couple weeks ago and I thought this place was the same as the truck, but I found out they are not one and the same. Either way, I was excited to try the food.  On a Sunday lunch, it was empty and we got our food pretty quickly. I thought the arepas were okay. The food tasted pretty good, but they were a bit soggy. I'd probably try this place again, but I will look for the food truck first."}
{"text":"I wish I could put 20 stars on this place best food las Vegas have.  The people that work there are the best too.  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week...best Venezuela restaurant in town!!!! I love eating their wood fire beef and I really love that they are not expensive"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and I got the shrimp arepa, mango drink, and a taco dessert with cheese (not sure what it's called). It's located downtown, in a not so safe area. Surprisingly, the place is quite popular, despite being in that area.   I'm not sure why they would run out of warm shrimps but the cashier told me... \"Is it ok. We don't have any warm shrimps left?\" I guess their arepas are premade or something.  Anyways, my order came with two spicy green sauce (not sure what it's called) and two cucumber sauces. The arepa, contrary to what I assumed, especially with the price, was quite small. It had a good amount of shrimp filling (but it was the smaller kind of shrimps). It was, however, really tasty. I just don't really understand why they couldn't make my food warm.   Anyhow... I'm giving it three stars because I think it was too expensive. The arepa was $7 and it wasn't filling at all."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Growing up in Miami, I took eating arepas for granted since they were all over with street vendors, in Costco, and some restaurants. Since moving to LA years ago, this was my first west coast experience while visiting Vegas and LOVED it. They're so much better than the plain cheese ones I used to get growing up. There's a lot of vegetarian flavor options and yummy side dishes to add. The staff was cracking up at my excitement seeing the menu and was really great helping my friends choose what to eat. I'm adding this place to my regular stops when I visit Vegas every few months. :)"}
{"text":"The wood fired beef arepas are aaaamazing!! I can't eat gluten- these are gluten free little sandwiches. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"A great place to have lunch in Downtown.  Don't let the corner location deter you...it's really, really, ridiculously good food.  I love the #7 (Reina Pepiada), which combines avocado and cilantro, two of my favorite food ingredients.  The patty is always so soft and warm, the filling well-seasoned and plentiful.  My friend says the pork-butt is also delicious.    We usually get the food to go, but it looks like they are building an actual restaurant on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming or Oakley.  Otherwise, there's a table (or two) on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd, and a couple of stools at the counter.  It can feel a little random, but also provides a good forum for people watching.  (Like who is ordering food at the Chinese food/donut shop across the street?)  The arepas are cheap, and I only need to order one because they're big!  Also, if you have an order of $10 or less, there's a 0.50 cent charge to use a debit or credit card."}
{"text":"place is neat and clean. Arepas were good and the grilled chicken is got to be one of the best deals in town! not sure about the ribs...go to Lucilles for those. the drinks were amazing! i was told that they are opening a gelato place soon next door. About time for some good gelato place"}
{"text":"So glad there is a west side location now! We've been loyal customers since they started outside Dino's"}
{"text":"this place its trule a must have in las vegas  thanks you guys are always great"}
{"text":"A must try!!! I sometimes just get a plain Arepa to munch on."}
{"text":"We've been in Vegas for a week and have driven by several times. We decided to stop in for breakfast and weren't disappointed. I had the wood fire chicken with egg and avocado added. He had the perico with cheese added. Both of our arepas were amazing!! It was fast, hot, and simply delicious. There were NO crumbs left over. It wasn't overly expensive either. I'm all for trying new foods that are affordable. Our two arepas plus two coffees was just under $20. I wish we had stopped sooner in our trip so we could've gone again."}
{"text":"I didn't like the corn bread (arepa), which is served with all sandwiches (I found later). We ordered 3 arepas: Reina Pepiada (chicken, avocado, mayo, cilantro), Garlic Shrimp, and Wood-fired Beef. Shrimp was bad, beef was a-ok. I only liked Reina Pepiada (which also happens to be their most popular item), but would have been better with a different bread. We also had fried plantain, which came SOAKED in oil. I've had it before elsewhere, it should not be.  Kudos to the cleanliness and the prices! Just not my cup-a-tea taste-wise."}
{"text":"VIva Las Arepas is super tasty! I was in heaven when I first tried their signature arepa. It's a little greasy, but that's to be expected. if you haven't tried the Venezualan soda, Frescolita, I highly recommend it - tastes like bubblegum. And it's the only place in Vegas you can find it. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"excellent food!!!!!  So fresh and so delicious!!!  I am hooked and am now a regular!"}
{"text":"This place is very authentic! I feel in love with the sandwiches. The employees are also great, they offer you excellent guidance. It's also a great way to fill the whole family on great quality food for cheap"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The food is good. I recommend the grilled meats over the arepas. The grilled meats come with two sides and are a far better deal for the money. The black bean side is very flavorful and good. The grilled meat has a nice bite and good flavor. The salad is just okay and mostly iceberg lettuce. It is worth a stop in for a quick lunch if you are near downtown."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.   I ordered the vegetarian arepas.  So fricken good! The \"bread\" was amazing! So much flavor and awesome texture.  Avocado, fresh. Black beans, flavorful and cannot be straight from a can!   The two sauces they give you...USE IT!   Every time I go to Vegas this will my FIRST stop.  Screw the buffets and everything else.  This is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Best arepas I have ever tasted. Went with the pulled pork and cheese and the beef and cheese. It was incredible. Very juicy meats and moist, tasty, corn cakes that had the essential griddle crunch on the outside. 4.50 or so per arepa-- take advantage of it. Cachapas were also very flavorful and slightly sweet."}
{"text":"Nice little place girth of the strip. If u go there ask them to deep fry ur order... Wow!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience being in and eating out in Vegas and I want to go back just to have one more arepa. They were absolutely amazing and I can't wait to visit Vegas again just to have one of these. The staff was also ridiculously nice. They were super patient with us tourists considering it took us forever to even make a decision on what to eat. I have to say best service I've ever gotten at a food truck/kiosk."}
{"text":"First time eating arepa. It was absolutely amazing. I had the number 7. Reina with plantains on the side. Really really good!"}
{"text":"We just rolled into Vegas starving. If you've never had an arepa, you've got to try one here, with plantains inside it, or on the side. It is delicious!  And you don't have to wait in line. Open till midnight. Off the Strip"}
{"text":"I was with a large group so we tried a lot of different things. There was not a single thing that was not good!  I read all of the reviews before going into the restaurant and I knew it looked good; however I was thinking it might be good food, but on the greasy side. Let me tell you, it was not at all! Everything was so flavorful and the nice guy that took our order was able to recommend some of the top meals. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wow the arepas were good at this place. Flavorful & freshly prepared, these were just fantastic. At the cashier's suggestion, I got the Pabellon (Shredded beef, black beans, plantain, & cheese). Just fantastic, and the spicy green tomatillo sauce adds to it even more.   Also at the cashier's suggestion, I got the Soursop to drink. It is mildly sweet and not sour at all.  Overall fantastic food & great service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food. I love the Arepas, they are all good. Go get some. Now. Seriously right now go eat! You'll love them."}
{"text":"Kinda in a scary part of town but let me tell you take the risk! Some of the best food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with the fiance. First time having Venezuelan food or Arepas.   The food was excellent! I got a wood-fired beef Arepa with cheese and avocado. I ordered avocado, but the cashier must not of heard me. When I got my order I noticed there wasn't avocado. I went up to the cashier and he let me know he didn't charge me for it. I was content with not having it, but he insisted he correct it no charge. They promptly fixed it and brought it to my table.   I also got the home-cut fries and the sugar cane with lime drink. The fries were seasoned well and cooked great. The drink was good, a different taste, but still good.  My fiance got the wood-fired chicken Arepa and it was equally as good. She tried the mango juice drink they have and it was amazing! Definitely wished I got that over the sugar cane.   All-in-all, definitely would like to go back and try other options. Excellent food and great service."}
{"text":"We visited Viva las Arepas on our recent trip to Vegas. I'm very familiar with Venezuelan food, my husband is Venezuelan so I have tried Venezuelan food  on my trips to Venezuela over the years , and learned to cook Venezuelan food myself. This place is pretty authentic in terms of the food they serve, staff is very friendly and the place was packed when we visited.We tried arepas with carne mechada, ham and cheese, tequeños and empanadas, also passion fruit juice. My favorite was the tequeños,fried cheese surrounded by crispy dough. The arepas are good, generous in the fillings,  but unfortunately, I was dissapointed  with the carne mechada, it was lacking that authentic flavor I'm used to, to me it was lacking in flavor, maybe  it needs some more cumin, garlic, and red peppers and onions, it didn't have any visible strips of onions and peppers that is traditional in venezuelan carne mechada. Also the cheese in the arepas looked like mozzarella, not the traditional queso fresco. Overall, I think this place is good and I would go back to try some of the other things they offer."}
{"text":"From New Jersey visiting Las Vegas and our friend whom lives locally took us to Viva Las Arepas.....unbelievable authentic arepas and empanadas!!!! #12 Pabellon Arepa AMAZINGGGGGG!!!! Mix grill is excellent, smoked flavor is out of his world. If wanting to eat something and willing to get off of the strip well worth it!! Keep up the authentic flavors...DELICIOSO"}
{"text":"Wow.  If you can get here and you're from out of town, GO!  If you're from Vegas and haven't been here, why not?  Wood fired chicken...check.  Fresh ingredients...check.  Local & not a chain...check.  Great service...check."}
{"text":"The absolutely tastiest food I've ever had! Everything they serve here is incredible! I will bring all my friends n family here. 5 star service and food :)"}
{"text":"Hella good food. It gets crowded and it's a small joint but for the cost and quality ratio... It's a good choice!"}
{"text":"Excellent Latin American food, great variety for all tastes, the steak over the mesquite wood is unique and Flavorfull,  Toni and his crew are pleasant and diligent, clean and family friendly place with authentic Venezuelan Flavor, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Goodness!! They make their arepas and empanadas with corn four and they are so good. I had the roasted pork butt and I highly recommend it. I also tried the reina pepiada, and vegetarian arepas. They were also good. I love their sauces.   The place was clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I came for lunch today with my little brother SUPER excited that they finally opened a location near us! I used to get some stuff from them when they parked outside of Tenaya Creek a couple years back and haven't eaten there since because of the distance to the downtown location.   We showed up and were starving so I got two arepas (ham and cheese and shredded beef + cheese) and a cheese empanada (I remember this from the food truck). My brother got himself a beef arepa with plantains, cheese, and beans. Everything was amazing! Super fresh and the accompanying salsa and cilantro mayo they give you took it to a whole different level. Yummmm. Needless to say, I could only eat half of each arepa and split the empanada with my brother so he could taste the amazing-ness. I still have leftovers in the fridge and I cannot wait to eat them. Most importantly, the service was incredible. So nice and attentive. I appreciate that very much. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I like a good walk for comfort food. This place came up high on the list when I Yelped \"best cheap eats\".  3 mile walk from my hotel?  Hey, I needed the exercise.   The place is clean and spacious. Kinda Chipotlesque with the stainless steel countertops and serving trays.   The menu is clear and simple to navigate. Plenty of very tasty sounding items. I ordered a wood fired chicken arepas and a beef/black bean/plantain/cheese arepas.  And a cup of water.   The friendly folks called my name when it was ready. They serve it up with two squeeze bottles of their special sauces. One mostly white (garlic) and one kinda orangish (spicy).  As served, the arepas are not terribly big looking, but they are well-wrapped in paper and, as I would soon find out, surprisingly filling.    First thing I noticed--the damn things are HOT.  As in temperature. Not only could I not take a bite out of them--I couldn't even hold them. So...I let them cool a bit.   Finally (recall I just walked three miles to get there) I took my first bite. The corn masa (or whatever they make the arepas out of) was tender and moist. The chicken was shredded and juicy. The beef/bean/plantain/cheese was just the same--both really good. I loved the white sauce on both of them. This Venezuelan food reminds me a little of Cuban food--which I love.   A few quibbles... - no fountain sodas. And they charged me for WATER.  I get Las Vegas is running desperately low on the stuff, but most restaurants aren't that stingy. - no forks.  The arepas are messy after about three bites.  - kinda not cheap. Both my arepas and my water were $12 and change. That's not exactly \"cheap eats\" in my book.   That being said, I enjoyed the food and look forward to going back again. Even if I have to walk three miles. I appreciate the exercise."}
{"text":"Having lunch here with my family and in-laws. Reasonable prices and tasty food. Love the arepas and the pabellon plate. The mixed grilled platter is also one of my favorites because of the mesquite flavor from the grill."}
{"text":"This was simply outstanding!  I don't think either of us have ever had Venezualan food, but this was incredible despite our lack of knowledge of the cuisine.  The actual owner of the restaurant took the order.  This is a very small operation with great service!  This is my first time writing a review, but this place is a hidden gem and needs the review!"}
{"text":"First time eating Arepas and it was very good. I go to Vegas every year and I finally was able to make the trek down there.  Awsome."}
{"text":"The food is a weak attempt at recreating authentic Venezuelan food . The Empanadas and Tequños are badly made and the Arepas aren't much better. The staff is also quite rude to each other which doesn't help the atmosphere of the place. Absolutely would not recommend, even out of curiosity.  El sabor de la comida no es bueno !"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The cachapas were good. Never really had arepas before but it wasn't all that great. My arepas came with black beans, but it was so packed with canned black beans as if they were trying to get rid of whatever extra they had. Great customer service though!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  FOOD/QUALITY: The food is amazing here! Although the may be famous for their Arepas, try the Cachapa con Queso! It only comes with cheese but you can ask to add beef, steak, chicken, or shrimp. TRY IT!   SERVICE: Very fast. The owner is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Amo este lugar! Venezolano que se respete extraña las arepas, las empanadas y el jugo de parchita, y aquí tienen todo eso y más. Siempre lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. Gracias por existir en Las Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth visiting!!!! The food is  amazing!!  We ordered the reina pepiada, arepa with cheese, and cachapa.  We also enjoyed the soursop drink and malta!!! You have to try the green and white sauce it is delicious. We are so glad we visited for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, filling, and delicious. This is my second stop and I had the #1 and #7. Great recommendations from the owner. I also had the pineapple and mango mix. For dessert, I loved the pastelitos of guava and cheese. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Get out of your hotel and try this gem for home-cooked, filling, and often gluten-free Latino food. Ride the monorail to the north end, take a taxi one mile north and you are there! Feed a crowd for cheap. Held back in the fifth star cuz we didn't eat the meats from the grill...yet!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Delicious. Amazeballs. The arepas are all gluten free! We enjoyed the pulled chicken the best, but the wood fired beef arepa was awesome too. The fried plantains were so tasty too. Yum yum. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great Venezuelan fast food - one arepa is not enough two is too much. Chicken and beef arepas are awesome but need added avocado (1,50) and cheese (.50). I like this place but it lacks some typical American main stays like fountain drinks and variety - but who cares!?"}
{"text":"Growing up one of my good friends parents' were from Venezuela and his mom used to make us arepas. It had been many years since I had had one of these great meals because I didn't know where to find them, so when I discovered this place I was elated. I usually get the chicken as well as the bean, add avocado, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Even being someone that is not familiar with Venezuelan food, I have always been amazed by Viva Las Arepas. The price is amazing and the food is exotic. The location is probably the best part about this place too being very central to Vegas but not flooding and after you eat you cannot pass up Art of Flavors next door."}
{"text":"Truly amazing stuff!! Had the shredded beef and the yucca fries. This place is a must-go-to whenever I'll be visiting Vegas from now on!"}
{"text":"After passing by this place a couple times, I've asked my co-workers if they've been here, and said it was nothing really special. Then I've checked yelp, with all the positive reviews I saw, I was sure my co-workers were wrong.   I decided to stop by the place 20 mins before closing, tried the chicken & the beef, I really wanted the empanadas, but they said the fryer was down, but i doubt that, seems like they wanted to get a head start on closing. Got the chicken & beef arepas. It was a small portion, but really stuffed with the meat, seems a bit overpriced for $3.50  I only ate half of each, it did have flavor, but it felt rather bland, it tasted like a mix of a packet of taco seasoning with some enchilada sauce.   After all the rave reviews here, I am quite dissatisfied with the food and the service, and the co-workers were definitely right about this place. I have to agree with the previous yelper review, place is totally over rated!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. I have lived in the states for over 20 years now and grew up eating Venezuelan Foods every day. Its been a few years since I have been able to go to Venezuela So when I hear of a Venezuelan Restaurant I always jump at the opportunity to try it.   I went to Vegas to visit my best friend who lives there and she took me here. I cried when I saw the Frescolita on the menu... no joke.... tears in my eyes... I LOVE Frescolita! I grew up on that!!   Their Arepas are great, their Pabellon was also great! Their Platanos are AMAZING and of course..... Frescolita. The only thing missing is the Candy - Pingpong, Pirullin, Ovolmantina.   The Cachapa was amazing! So good!! I wish they had Cachitos- but you cant win them all!   Really Truly Great Venezuelan food- From a Venezuelan......  Quick mention too: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Read a couple of reviews on here about bad customer service. People can be WAY to picky! They say hello, they take your order, they bring it to you and they thank you. What more do you need? Didnt realize people needed their hand held to order food...."}
{"text":"We stopped in Las Vegas specifically looking for this place.  I was very pleased with my arepa! Prices aren't low, but the quality of the meal we ate spoke for them.  Would def recommend :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and authentic Venezuelan food. I had pabellón arepa and an empanada , both delicious. There's parking as well A must when visiting vegas !"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. My first experience eating arepas. Had the pork butt with tomatoes and cheese. Mmmmm....and don't forget to try a guava and cheese fried thingy (can't remember the exact name) but boy was it good."}
{"text":"Great service, our first time here, the guy at the counter was super helpful, gave us some suggestions! I had the the #7 chicken, avocado sauce! It was very tasty, the bread is a white corn meal type, the meat was all white meat and very tasty! My buddy had the beef, it looked great and he said it was definitely something he would get again! The place was busy, clean and comfortable! We shared the deep fried pork and yucca root fries, not bad especially with the spicey jalapeño sauce! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had several empanadas, the reina pepiada arepas, and friend plantains. Delicious! Totally hit the spot and some great real fruit drinks to wash it down. The whole sugar cane with lime was the bomb. Awesome joint near the OG...."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful friendly staff, and price are reasonable. Amazing place gor locals and visitors alike with a easy downtown access."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! No matter what I order, I'm always satisfied. A must for me is their fried platains, all time favorite! Also their agua frescas are amazing. Good way to cool off in this summer heat!!"}
{"text":"If you've never had Arepas this is the place to go! Staff was informative about everything on the menu and even suggested the best side to order. Great food, definitely didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I finally made it here and I'm glad I did! Considering that it looks like a small place from the outside, it's pretty open with plenty of seating, inside and out, and pretty clean. Service was fast, the food came even faster, we ordered a little of everything, and it was all excellent, but what stood out for me the most were the empanadas, pipping hot and a nice variety of fillings. I definitely will be back to try more items! Thumbs up!!! I give you a perfect 10!"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on yelp!! The food is amazing and different than what any nearby restaurants offer. The best part is it's CHEAP"}
{"text":"I stayed in vegas for 4 nights and this was the best food I ate in my entire trip. I had dined in Aria, Bellagio and Monte Carlo and nothing came close. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Had to stop in after seeing the Woof Fired Grill sign out front.  Had the half chicken with rice and beans.  Fantastic meal.  Chicken was cooked perectly and the smoke flavoring was something new for me.  Ate the entore serving of chicken.  The rice and beans reminded me Cuban black beans and rice.  Arepas rice included some veggies, I belive fava beans and green bean, nice addition."}
{"text":"I have been to Las Vegas Blvd Location a few times but i find out the Rainbow Location  I love Arepas the Reina Pepiada and my Huband loves the carne azada Arepa and the shredded beef empanadas   The service was great and the guy behind the counter was extremely nice will definitely be  returning"}
{"text":"Felicitaciones. Disfrute cada pedacito de mi Venezuela y una helada frescolita. Les recomiendo absolutamente todo"}
{"text":"One of my number one spots to eat in vegas...viva las arepas never let u down.  Woodfire is the best has such a smoky delicious flavor and the sauces they have available on the side compliment the sandwiches so nicely.  Will definitely be a go to spot for me and my friends for a long time!"}
{"text":"My first time there ... Really good , portions are filling and delicious !!! It feels authentic ."}
{"text":"This place hardly needs another review, however, I just spent 4 days in Las Vegas eating at pretentious, overpriced restaurants on the strip. Right before heading for the airport we caught a quick lunch at this place and I have to say . . . It was the most delicious meal I had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of our neighborhood favorites. Great food, courteous staff, and the restaurant is clean and modern."}
{"text":"What can I say about Viva Las Arepas? One word: AMAZING!   The food is fresh and delicious. I have never ordered anything here that has not made my taste buds dance. I've been here about 10 times since they opened. Felix(the owner) is personable and friendly. Everything on the menu is below 5.00. One arepa will fill you up. But I will warn once you go here you'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I try to eat here as often as possible. We also invite all of our unadventurous non-foodie friends to try this place and make them believers in Venezuelan cuisine!  We usually order way too much food because it's so good and we stuff ourselves to eat it all. A half grilled chicken with black beans and rice, an arepa pepiada, yuca fries, empenadas and pasteles... seriously, anything you order will satisfy your hunger.   Go before lunch and beat the rush! Customer service is always on point. Everyone that works there is so friendly and willing to explain the menu."}
{"text":"I had the pork butt and the black bean and cheese arepas, my wife had the shredded beef. Pork butt: Thee best of the bunch, salty in a  good way. Shredded beef: Very good flavor, sauce and juicy. Black bean and cheese: Not good at all, beans were all right but the type of sliced cheese they use did not complement the bean consistency. Agua de Mango: So delicious.  I will return because I want another pork butt arepa and to try the rest."}
{"text":"If you're coming to Vegas, make a special point of seeking this place out. It is in an old neighborhood by the Stratosphere so make the detour to the spot the locals love. The food is exceptional! I had the pork ribs and my wife had empanadas and arepnas. The rub they used was a bit saltier than I'd use but the meat was so tender you could suck it off the bone. Excellent! We finished off with pastelitos for desert. Best food value we've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Gone twice now to both locations now and all I can say is wow. I love the food. The Pabellon is a must. Meat sweet plantains black beans all good stuff. Order a side of the yuka fries and pork rinds. Make sure to grab the bottle green sauce and hot sauce they have behind the counter."}
{"text":"More food than you can eat.  The ribs are melt in your mouth and tasty.  The bottled sauces bring a welcome new flavor.  I will be back with friends."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!! I cannot describe there food amazing staff and food. I got there at least once a month I've brought man family members I would recommend this place to anyone :) trust me I was scared to try it at first as well but now it's like a addiction I cannot wait they are opening a closer location to me!!!"}
{"text":"My newest addiction! Arepas are so good. It's like a taco but instead of a flour or corn tortilla it's a better pita like shell. I recommend the carne asada but there chicken is good as well, I'm sure the others are too, but not tried them all yet..lol. If I could afford it, I'd eat it everyday..haha. I also like there chicharron and fritas, but not all will like if you are unfamiliar. Oh I also like there fried plantains, done right!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious and my kids love the chicken empenadas and their tasty fries. Pernil Arepas is what I would suggest...that's gotta be my favorite. Also the owners and staff take pride in their work and it shows. Friendly service and good food :)"}
{"text":"Mix both sauces together. Pernil arepas. Passion fruit drinks. Chicken empenadas. Do it."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a quick lunch on my way out of Vegas. The plaza isn't very inviting. But the place is clean and bright inside, which was encouraging.  I stepped up to the counter and the cashier spent a full 3 seconds staring at my boobs before asking for my order.   MINUS ONE STAR  We ordered one beef and one shredded chicken arepa. The beef one was more flavorful, tasted like sloppy joes almost. The chicken was a little bit dry but that special green sauce fixed that. We also ordered one beef and one chicken empanada. The empanadas felt too doughy and barely had any meat. They were like plain, less meaty versions of the arepas.   Fried plaintains were good though. Oily, hot and satisfying. Also had their sugar cane juice with lime. I didn't like that at all.  Minus another star for skimpy meat filled empanadas and the sour drink."}
{"text":"Best arenas I've ever had. Highly recommend coming here. One of my favorite place in Vegas to go. If your a local or a visitor this is one place to come check out."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant, I had their food few years ago from the food truck.  It was really good I will definitely go back to try different things from the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place for a taste of Venezuela! I had been a frequent flyer at their stand just down the street and love what they have done with the new restaurant. The menu has expanded but includes all of the old favorites. Definitely try the Arepas with wood fired beef as well as the roasted pork butt. Chicken is also a good standby. My wife is a fan of the bean and cheese empanadas. You can't go wrong ordering anything from their menu. The servings are a good size with plenty of meat, but the star of the show is the Arepa shell. Made from cornmeal, the shell is cooked crisp and cut open for stuffing. They are crunchy on the outside and very tender on the inside. Delish! All items are served with a cilantro sauce and a spicy sauce for those who like a little heat."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Venezuelan food and it was amazeballz. The chicken arepas are so delish and filling. I give this place 5 totes yummers!"}
{"text":"We visited Viva Las Arepas for the 2nd time ever and it was just as good as the first. I tried the carne asada arepa, hubby had frijoles con queso, and my mom had the pollo. My mother is one of the pickiest eaters I've ever met and she loved it! She actually said she loved the arepas more than a gordita or a pupusa, which is saying a lot. I like the pollo arepa more than the asada, but I am not much of a beef eater to begin with.  The meat has a smokey taste, great seasoning, and the arepa masa is amazing. I also tried the passionfruit juice which was delicious! The next time you are in Vegas, this place is a must! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So, I'm a guy who will always recommend the pork or the beef. Never the chicken.  Here, though, you should get the chicken. Empanadas, specifically. So you know the chicken is for real. Wood-fired and smoky. It's really, really good.  This is on my best-of-Vegas list. Amazingly flavorful little Venezuelan sandwiches, super friendly guys working, they let you bring beer from White Cross market across the street, and occasionally you get weird stuff happening: last time a woman was loitering outside and ended up flashing us all for no apparent reason. No one wanted to see that, but it's a good story.  Super cheap, super delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Read some good things online about this little place and it certainly is very authentic stuff! Great food, good prices, solid service. Not the greatest location and off the Strip close to the Stratosphere, but that's part of the charm.   We tried the standard beef and chicken arepas with a side of plantains. Definitely hit the spot! Make the trek north of the main casinos, and enjoy delicious, fresh, made-to-order, authentic South American food - you will be glad you did. And if you're into that sort of thing, drive just a little farther north and visit the Pawn Shop from the TV show \"Pawn Stars,\" and on your way back to the Strip hit up the Bonanza Gift Shop, which touts itself as the world's largest gift shop."}
{"text":"We were meeting some friends at the Stratosphere and decided to stop by here since it was literally across the street.  The parking lot was tiny and somewhere you don't want to be walking around alone in at night, but the small sit down restaurant was simple and clean. We ordered the grilled chicken arepas and black bean and cheese empanadas.  The food took almost 20 minutes to come out and it wasn't that busy around 5:30 pm on a Friday evening. The arepas look kind of small, but they were much bigger and stuffed so we really didn't need the empanadas!  The cornmeal breading was so yummy and the grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato and cheese was really good. They served their hot sauce and another sauce with cilantro/mayo on the side which were good complements but not necessary with the arepas.  The empanadas were greasy and only half filled on the inside, but tasty.  Didn't have any room for the guava/cheese pastelito, but would love to try it next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's quickly become one of my favorite spots in Vegas. Very clean, friendly staff, and amazing food. The meat has a delicious smokey flavor and the Arepas are tremendous."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We had the carne asada arepas and it was so filling. The green sauce is also very good. It adds a little kick to the carne asada. Can't wait to go there for lunch again!"}
{"text":"This is the place you would walk in hungry expecting something exotic and you won't be disappointed when you walk out.. you walk out with a great experience and a mouthful of great flavor. Not only is the food of great quality the service is equivalent. The guy across the counter took the time to explain what Arepas actually are and how they are made. Extremely humble and courteous person. I would certainly come back..."}
{"text":"Ordered vegetarian arepas, black bean and cheese empanada  We also got beef arepas and 3 piece chicken    Arepa was really good so was the black bean empanada   I wish they had a red sauce  They had a creamy cilantro sauce and a green sauce.   Chicken was good and so was the beef arepas.    All that with a can of sprite came to about $25"}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite before a meeting nearby. I had been meaning to try this place for a couple of years. Am sorry I waited so long!  I had the shredded pork arepa and it was totally awesome,  juicy and very tasty. My friend had the wood fired beef and and she enjoyed that. Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"We order one each of the house-recommended arepas.  While some of the combinations were a little exotic for my kids, I found everything to be delicious.  Definitely a must for those who want to try something a little unusual.  There were a number of other things on the menu that I would have like to have tried.  The service was very friendly.  Definitely in a seedier area of downtown, so we parked where we could see the car.  A great value for great and unusual food."}
{"text":"Delicious arepas! Great find! Highly recommend the steak arepas and the bean and cheese. The price is very affordable. The service is excellent. The restaurant is clean. I will definitely be coming back to try other arepas here while I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just have a few words about this business, \"GREAT SERVICE, AWESOME FOOD, CLEAN ESTABLISHMENT.\" This all I have to say about this place. If you don't believe, then go see for yourself. Oh, I should tell you the food was freshly made with a neat oven. The food that I had was freshly smoked and just amazing!"}
{"text":"So thankful for the bloggers and helpers that suggested this glorious establishment. I had a vegetarian arepa, with cheese, no tomato, and enjoyed every savory bite. I am already mentally planning my next visit or two before I leave town in a few days. The staff were also very friendly and the place super clean."}
{"text":"This place is a real GEM!  Super authentic Venezuelan/Colombian arepas and empanadas.   Very reasonable priced.    I had lunch AND dinner there yesterday.  I will be returning now very time I'm in town.   WE NEED VIVA LAS AREPAS IN LOS ANGELES, PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"Good food, wonderful customer service!  The food is delicious. The roasted pork butt, the plantains & the green sauce... delicious! The food is also really filling so one arepa will probably fill you up. Arepas range from $4-$7. Oh and their guava drink! Sooo good.   It's just a few minutes off the main strip between the strip & downtown. The parking lot is a bit small, but luckily when we went, there were available parking spots. It's a little hard to find and the lot is really small, but just look for the big orange AREPAS sign. If you're tired of the buffets, give this a try! It's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome !!  I had the vegetarian option and then added beef on top :-)  I also had the lime cane sugar drink.    It was Delicious!!  with the salsa and all those veggies on it...  the little arepas must have weighed well over a pound.  good food with everything arepas, drink, tip it was about $10 well worth it I was full and satisfied !1 I have to go back and try more things..FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The guy that takes the orders is always nice, pleasant, professional. Excellent customer service.  The arepas are tasty. The beef and chicken got this wood grilled smoky taste. So good. I also ordered the grilled chicken thighs. Once again, the smoky flavor is amazing. Add the pesto sauce and I'm in heaven. To top it off, the Cachapas is to die for. Corn bread with cheese. Oh my goodness. Glutinous.  Finally, the prices were definitely on the low side for a shop located on the blvd and down the street from the Strat. I think for the four of us we spent under $40 and we were very satisfied.  Great place Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"Awesome! Very friendly and helpful staff. Food was superb! We tried a few of the suggestions from the owner including the yuca fries. Everything was excellent. The fruit drinks were very good as well."}
{"text":"Must come back here again.  Arepas, yuka fries, fried pork, cheese sticks - ALL FRESH. really good!! Best Venezuelan food ever ate so far. SourSap Juice - was ehhh. skip.  Will definitely drop by every time I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I'm from Venezuela and is a good place your arepas are very good but definitely aren't Venezuelan traditional arepas, are different but still been good.!!"}
{"text":"im venezuelan and this is the best arepas i have ever try in my life!! highly recomend it"}
{"text":"I have been reading about this place for quite some time. I've been wanting to drop by, but it's in a part of town I almost never find myself in. So last Thursday I got off work a little early and I asked the wife if she would like to try the place out.  Now let me preface what I am about to say by letting you know that I used to live in Venezuela, birth place of the wonderful arepa. I ate arepas every single day I lived there. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Mid-afternoon snack. I've had them cooked on a griddle(traditional), deep-fried, and baked. And I loved them all. I cannot ever remember getting one I didn't like. My favorites order was \"Dos arepas de pollo y un pepsi (pronounced peksi down there)\" from La Areparia Diecinueve De Abril in Cumana. I'd stop there at least once a day.  That said, it was to my ginormous disappointment that last Thursday I had my first bad arepa.  Sorry folks, a  precooked arepa that's been sitting in a heating tray only to be tossed on the griddle at the last minute to be reheated is bad from the word go. Add to that mushy, bland pollo mechada(shredded chicken), and things don't get much better. The carne mechada (shredded beef) wasn't much better, or should I say not as bad. The jugo de parchita was watered down to the point of being almost indiscernible as passion fruit juice.  I promise, I really had high hopes for this place. Being the only Venezuelan restaurant in Las Vegas I was excited to try it. But as much as it pains me to say, Viva Las Arepas, I know arepas, and you are no arepa."}
{"text":"This was my first shot at Venezuelan cuisine and I loved it. We ordered Reina Pepiada, chicken empanadas, fried bananas and Guava Pastelitos (this one is sweet like a dessert). The Arepas looked small but  were quite filling for me. We enjoyed all items we ordered except fried bananas (they were very oily and mushy different from what I was expecting).  The service was also good. The person taking our order explained what the dishes were so we could make an informed order. If you are into trying different cuisines this one is definitely worth trying :D"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is super friendly. I've read some reviews that it's located in a super sketchy place. It's not  it's right next to the stratosphere. It's really nice and calm. But the food is just out of this world. I got a number 1 and 2. The beef and chicken, a order of fries and a mango water. Trust me the arepas look small but they are packed. I got full with one, the mango water is a agua fresca made with fresh mangos. This is a must. Will be going back real soon with my family."}
{"text":"Chicarron & Yuca Frita (4 stars); Usually were good but the chicarron tasted different (in a bad way) the last time he had it, hopefully it's just a fluke. The yuca frita (fried yucca root) is the star though.   Mixed grill (4 stars);  Huge portion, need 3 persons to finish it. Taste good, especially the sausage. Looove the sausage.  Arepas - pork butt and garlic shrimp (5 stars); You can have the garlic shrimp served cold or hot. I've tried both but personally like hot better.   Place is clean, so is the restroom. Staff are always nice and polite."}
{"text":"We went to this place because of the high review.  Ordered the pork butt Arepas and the Shrimp garlic Arepas. Also some plantains.  Also one of those lemonade drink.  I have to say the pork butt one is better. Shrimp garlic one is actually served cold. I was quite surprised. Food is a bit on the salty side. Again, I don't think the food is excellent.  Plantains are good. Lemonade, however, is not that great.  Another thing to keep in mind is that this is in the ghetto neighborhood of Vegas.  We went there for lunch and felt a bit off when we got there.  And we had to leave quickly after some weirdo came into the restaurant, sat across my wife and kept on staring at her."}
{"text":"The food is good.  First time here and was invited by a friend and I like it.  The beef or chicken empanadas are amazing.  The Cachapa was out of this world.  Great win and great find.  The reason I gave it a four stars refers to the drink selection.  Authentic food but no so much with the drinks. Water downed and not very good for my taste."}
{"text":"Most amazing Venezuelan food I've had in a really long time. i am Venezuelan and highly recommend this place. I would go back to Vegas just for their empanadas. Visited and had arepa de pabellon, empanadas and tequenos. Everything was amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time there and the cashier was extremely helpful and attentive. He knew I was lost so he took the time to ask a few questions and then make suggestions. The portion if the arepas may be deceiving though. They come small but they pack a heavy punch. 1 will fill you, 2 Will stuff you.   I must suggest the plantains! They were cooked perfectly with just the right amount if sweetness.   One con would be the parking. I would suggest parking in the back of the building if you are not alone."}
{"text":"This was my very first arepa and it was delicious! Fast, friendly service, convenient parking, and inexpensive, but delicious food. I tried the carne asada this time and took the cashier's advice and added avocado; good recommendation! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I had a chicken empanada and  reina peplada arepa also Try the French fries with the green and aji sauce and some pepper. Pleasant place. Inside is clean and enjoyable. Awesome customer service! Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a long time, so glad my husband and I finally made it there!   First off, the staff is great and the cashier was very helpful. I had the wood fired chicken #2 (arepa) and it was very good. My husband had the beef with plantains #12, and he was in heaven.   From living in the Caribbean I'm obsessed with fried plantains and these didn't disappoint. I will go pick up $3 plantains any day!   We also had fried yuca, but I didn't love it. Yuca has never been a favorite though.   Each arepa is around $5... Totally worth the price.   4 stars because of the location and we has to park across at the pharmacy, but We will definitely be back when we head downtown."}
{"text":"Best grilled chicken in town and their black beans are soooo good.  I recommend the pork butt and shrimp arepas!"}
{"text":"The cashier was very friendly. She asked me if it was my first time and recommended me the most popular options. There was no disappointment there. I love the chicken in an avocado cilantro sauce. So delicious and the greem sauce was perfectly spicy!!! She also recommended I try the parchita drink. Soooooo good and refreshing!!!! The arepas are also made to order"}
{"text":"Always good. One of my favorite places to eat. Reina Pepiada Arepas = chicken salad style....highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is. So. Good. Go there.   My husband and I went downtown for date night and stopped in here to get dinner. I had the arepa with avacado on it and the plantains and he had the pork arepa. All of it was perfect. I usually don't eat bread, but made an exception after reading reviews of this place and I'm glad that I did. The cornbread rolls they make the sandwiches with are so delicious. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the service was super friendly; now my husband mentions this place every date night."}
{"text":"I wanted to really love this place. Saw the good reviews. Went there for lunch and had to wait over 45 mins. Owner kept saying a couple workers called in sick. Got our food and it was ok. I couldn't taste any seasonings. We had the Reina Pepiada and Pabellon.  May try this place again"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Food delivered in a timely manner. Very clean place. I recommend the Arepa de Pollo."}
{"text":"I've been hearing raving reviews of this place for a long time now and finally had the chance to try it out last weekend. I've never had Venezuelan food or arepas before, and I am now a big fan!  My friend and I tried the fire wood beef, shredded chicken, and pork butt arepas, and they were all delicious. My favorite is the fire wood beef one, the beef was super tender and flavorful! Make sure you try them with the two sauces (not sure what they are called), the creamy green one is very good! And definitely try the fried plantains, I love the little bit of char on them, so sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"You need to pig out here! Delicious economical and with a great staff will be back here tomorrow! Phenomenal food! Try the chicken thighs and of course arepas"}
{"text":"Wow! These arepas are stuffed with so much meat, I made the mistake of ordering 2 and could only eat half of each, one chicken the other beef. Good flavor and worth the price."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this place for so many years, we finally stopped in and the inside looks 100 times better than the outside! Very cozy and nice indoor setting.  The food however could have been better.  Way too americanized and not enough culture in the food.  I was also tipsy so if it's not on point after a few drinks, i don't think it's worth a try when sober."}
{"text":"First time trying an arepa, and it was delicious! I tries the pork butt and it was moist and tender. The arepa was packed with pork. The bread was a little greasy, but I loved how it was crispy.   I think this is the only place I have come across selling passion fruit (besides a boba shop), guava, soursop, and sugar cane juice.   I will definetely be back again. Fyi, credit cards are accepted if your purchase is more than $10, otherwise it's a $0.50 fee."}
{"text":"The arepas taste Just as I remember the original place in the middle of a parking lot, chowing doen in the hot vegas heat for a cheap and delicious meal. I'm glad the recipes are exactly the same and the owner has stayed true to his food and has done well enough to expand!  The pork butt is still my favorite with super soft and tender pulled pork sandwiched between delicious masa. Add avocado for a mind blowing experience."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS! First time having an arepa and now its one of my favorites. The staff is super warm, friendly, and extremely helpful. Highly recommend the Pabellon! We'll definitely be back....adding this spot to our Vegas go-to list."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We ate here 4 times in 3 days. #2 Chicken Arepas with their cream sauce. Great staff and service! Wish we had one where we live! Highly recommend heading North from the strip to enjoy this place. The Monorail stop at SLS is about 1/3 mile from restaurant. $5 per Arepa and one is plenty. They are filling. The mango and passion fruit drinks are great too."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Venezuelan fare.  I highly recommend the various stuffed arepas, the catchapa and the fried yucca. The atmosphere is that of a fast food type joint but the food makes up for it and then some. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Its an orgasm in your mouth, in the parking lot of Dinos. In a totally legal way. I hit this place up at least every other night and usually drag suburban friends along too, to show them how we roll in downtown. The Arepas are fuggin amazing! Felix the boss man is the friendliest guy will meet downtown too! You can have 2 of these sandwiches and you'll be totally stuffed. Sitting outside of the little Arepas shop is the perfect place to \"people stare\". You can watch the escorts,homeless,drunk tourists,out of country tourists,rich people and crazy people all walk by while you sit and stare. Once done you can walk 20 steps to either Dinos for Karaoke and the strongest and cheapest drinks in Vegas or across the street to Olympic Gardens to get your \"perv\" on tipping the ladies. If you are ever around the Stratosphere or downtown, definitely make the very short trip to the corner of Wyoming and Las Vegas blvd. You WON'T be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Kind of sad~ Loved what Felix did at the stand, but when he got into the real B&M, seems like it's more about the hype than the food~ (It's foreign, so it's awesome!) No, it's not~ It's Dry chicken, Dry pork, and Dry beef~ F'ing Dry~ What a D'bag to serve such poorly prepared food~ Sad~ In a third world roll~ I'm so cool because I love it! No, I'm not~ Dry protein in a third world tube roll is worse than a TV Dinner~ Because you paid for it, and told your friends how good it was~ Oh, and the Gelato shop next door?  He owns that too~ But not a feature of VLA~ Do your self a favor and check Luv-It around the corner~ It may appeal more to an honest palate~ And skip the overcooked third world sammich shop~ Lot's of good, honest food in Vegas, even in that neighborhood~ Just makes me sad I spent my money there~ Just think, \"Dry\"~"}
{"text":"I'm glad this local business is thriving, but I was disappointed with my experience. I found the wood fired chicken and shredded beef lacking in any discernible flavor other than salt. And the salt ruined the food for me. I enjoyed the sauce/additions on both, but when I am eating meat, I don't want to feel like a dish NEEDS the sauce. These arepas did. In addition, the texture of both was also very....mushy. Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I will give them another chance and hope that I caught them on a bad day.  I ate arepas made by hand years ago and they were outstanding. So I know I like arepas.  I realize it is not fair to compare homemade preparation with a fast food preparation, but I really wanted (and expected) to love the product at Viva Las Arepas. I didn't expect it to taste like homemade, but I did expect better than what they delivered. It remains to be seen if this was a bad day, or just not the business for me. I will go back and try the vegetarian option to find out.   I'm not giving up on you, VLA!"}
{"text":"Nice change from the usual fare. My husband had a beef Arepas and I had the beef epanada. We were not disappointed at our choices."}
{"text":"Tried out Viva Las Arepas in Las Vegas since I read good things about it.  And next door is Art of Flavor a gelato place so I wanted to try both.  Since we weren't too hungry we got 1 arepa to share.  Roasted pork butt w/ tomato slices $5 - meat was very salty and dry to me, tomato slices I only saw one tiny slice no flavor.  Put the green sauce which is the spicy one!  Yummy sauce.  Arepa itself was grilled and tasty.    Colita soda - Venezuelan soda smelled and tasted like bubblegum - skip it.  I want to go back to try Black beans & cheese $5 or Vegetarian $5."}
{"text":"Wood fire beef arepa was tasty!  Make sure to drench it with the two types of sauces."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas I come to eat to Viva Las Arepas a jewel at the end of the strip. The Pabellon arepas were delicious according to my friend. I had the Pork Smoke Arepa and it was also very tasty. I had tried  La Rena Pepiada before and it's still one of my favorites. The cashier and all the staff are very nice, smile all the time, and help you with suggeations."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food... Nice getaway from the strip... The arepa sandwiches were flavorful and super filling... The yucca fries weren't too shabby either... They also serve sauces with their meals, one spicy and another some sort of cilantro cream sauce, both amazing! Do not leave vegas without a stop here!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, definitely a must have if youre in the area. But the seating isnt so great and the location is sketchy. Nonetheless, the food will bring me back!"}
{"text":"Arepas - wood fire beef and empanadas with chinken were delicious. Good food for good price served by nice staff !!! :)"}
{"text":"Now that was delish!  The arepas, Venezuelan-style sandwiches, I got was packed with nicely shredded and flavored pork although it was a tad dry. I'm looking forward to trying the many other ones they have. What I really loved was the beef empanada. It was also packed with juicy, shredded beef. All their food came out piping hot the way I like it. They brought it to my table fairly quickly with two sauces. I especially liked the light green one. The only downside is that it's pricey for small arepas."}
{"text":"I went to a function last night and needed a quick dish to take. I never knew this place was here but WOW!!! The manager Tony introduced me to cachapa. Its corn and cheese grilled and glazed. Sooo good and what a hit it was on the buffet. The place is tucked away in a corner but don't miss it. I am going back very soon. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"It was a good \"sandwich\" rather arepa. But to me it was really not all that special for $6. The arepa was rather small for what you pay for and didn't really think it was worth it. It was tasty though. I ordered the reina  pepiada. It had a lot of mayo and it reminded me of a chicken salad sandwich so it wasn't really too special."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such good food, and such nice people, the arepas de pabellon is amazing, and the tequenos are my favorite! I am a venezuelan from los angeles and this really hit close to home, such good food!"}
{"text":"Solid arepas at an above-average price, but since it's Vegas it probably gets another star."}
{"text":"Hit I LUV AREPAS for a quick lunch snack - I think it's actually smaller than a food truck !  I originally thought it replaced the Naked City Sammie space but not true - a stand alone shack on Dino's  parking lot ( maybe it uses the NC space for prep work ... not sure )   Had the pollo arepas ( $3 ) and the carne ( $3.50 )   Comes with a side of spicy and mild sauce - damned if I know what's in them  the spicy had a smokiness to it, the Mild a cream base - both very good.  The arepas ??  I actually like the pollo more but both were very good.  They basically take a corn based thick pancake,  cut in 1/2 and stuff with meat - no frills - simple food with great flavor .  I wanted a bacon dog ($2.25 ) but not ready yet - next time because there will be many next times  crappy pics added"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast!!! They open at 8am daily. Inexpensive, filling and DELICIOUS!!! Makes your belly feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Check it out!....and that cilantro lime sauce....I just wanted to squirt the whole bottle in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Amazing Venezuelan food!!  I love the arepa de cachapa and these are probably better than the Colombian (arepa de chocolo) ones I've had.  The service was great and it's not far from the Vegas strip.  The prices are more than fair but I had to place a second order because I knew I wouldn't find Arepas like these back home.  I would highly recommend if you enjoy Latin food!!"}
{"text":"I Love Arepas!!!! Ate the Lingua, bacalao, and ham n cheese, all were delicious.   THe owner is super cool, and let us try one of his new creations, which was like a fresh ground corn cake filled with  cheese, awesome!  This is straight forward, no frills, or BS food.  I'm craving their arepas writing about them right now!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the family, service was great staff was friendly and the food was very authentic. Surprised at how good the chicken wings were. The Arepas were crisp, tender with lots of Filling"}
{"text":"All I can say it AWESOME!! AWESOME everything about this place. It's clean, food it delicious,  and the customer service was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"When I think of a dive, this is everything I picture. The location isn't the best, the decor isn't anything that makes you want to stick around, but the food is rockstar.   I ordered the chicken arepa and the plantains. The chicken is dripping from all of the juices. It's super flavorful and super messy. The sauce that they serve with it isn't necessary, but it's definitely great! The sauce kicks up the heat a bit, which I appreciate.  The plantains were about as addictive as potato chips. They were nice and salty and just the right texture.   The prices are pretty spot on. I only needed one arepa and the plantains. For $10, you can get plenty of food.  Check it out for something different."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying arepas and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It had a meat heavy taco style filling in a small cornmeal pita shaped pocket. The fillings were definitely tasty and they give you sauces to put on top, but the pocket tasted a little bland to me"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little place for some flavorful south American food. Several varieties with different spice levels. Salsas and sauces available to complement your meal. I somehow landed at this place while driving and am so glad I did."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The garlic shrimp arepa and fried plantains are sooo good!! The ribeye steak was a very generous portion for the price!   Will definitely be back soon and recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! It's been a longtime since their \"shack\" location and very happy to see they're doing well. The restaurant is always clean, the employees are very friendly ad the owner is super nice, too.   My husband is a vegetarian so it has something for both of us. We've never had anything on their menu we haven't liked. My go-to is the shredded beef because the meat is seasoned so well and it's a super tasty bite. Even their rice is good! Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! The owner is super nice and happy to make suggestions. Food is ridiculously good."}
{"text":"WOW! The Arepas came out piping hot and were really yummy. We tried both the Chicken and Veggie Arepas. They were really good. We like this place so much we went there on a 2 day visit to Las Vegas.  The only problem with this place is the location. The location is a bit dicey."}
{"text":"Really delicious food. We got a mixed grill meat platter, yuca fries, and a cachapa. The cachapa was amazing - you can really taste the corn and the combination with cheese is great. The meat was just right - not too dry, not too fatty. Smother that stuff in the green (cilantro?) sauce that comes with every meal."}
{"text":"O.M.G!!! Have been recommended by so many to come here and I finally made it. It was way above and beyond expectation, so delicious that if I lived in Vegas I would probably eat there every day. We tried 4 different arepas and they were all scrumptious even though the consensus was that the chicken with avocado was a snap above. I can't wait to come back and try the rest! Absolutely lovely service as well. Please open a place in LA, there is such a market for this here."}
{"text":"Usually get the number 3 Arepas at the other location. The number 3 here actually tasted better than the other location I'd say. The \"bun\" was a harder texture here. My girlfriend got a beef empanadas and it was also pretty good. Service was fast and decent"}
{"text":"Ok this is definitely a gem even for the locals.  Great food here.  Everything I have tried has been awesome.  Tropical flavors. Fresh fruit juices to order.  Wife loved the great Vegetarian options available.  When you are done walk next door for fresh Gelato another gem...  Thank you Viva Las Arepas"}
{"text":"So good! Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Las Vegas. The food is tasty and the service is terrific."}
{"text":"The best food for your soul : arepas! Had arepas and empanadas last night and they were delicious! The staff was nice. They had a comfortable outside patio, just incase you want to bring your pooch along. I'll be glad to say I was a little fatty and ate a rather large portion of empanadas. No regrets!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Venezuelan food! Arepas, cachapas, tequeños and they even have frescolita! Very consistent food and super friendly service."}
{"text":"Nothing like the excellent tasty arepas i used to get in Puerto Ordaz.  Disappointed.  No way a four star place"}
{"text":"Arepas here are delish!  It is located near downtown LV but don't let that stop you from coming. The food is great at very reasonable prices!  The place is extremely clean with very friendly people working there!  We will definitely be making this place a regular spot when we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came across Viva Arepas, 2 years ago, while it was still in its previous address - a shack about half a block up from their current location.  Viva Arepas is a Venezuelan restaurant that specializes in Authentic Venezuelan food. The Arepas are phenomenal!! They are small \"sandwiches\" filled with choices like: shredded beef with peppers and onions, garlic shrimp, bean and cheese - to name e a few choice. They also have wood fired chicken that comes with a choice of sides.  The drinks are also authentic to Venezuela - all being natural and refreshing."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was great! Definitely authentic! Everything was prepared as if homemade and we left satisfied!"}
{"text":"So, our buddy Drew picks us up from our hotel to hang out for the day. \"What would you guys like to eat?\" he asks. We were somewhere between zombified and comatose due to lack of sleep and too much booze still pumping through our blood streams. Between the three of us visitors all we could manage was some kind of grunt, \"Grughhh\". Fed up with our antics, Drew took charge and brought us here.....and I still thank him. I ordered the Reina Pepiada: Chicken, Avocado, Mayo and Cilantro. So Damn Good! I was lucky enough to have ordered a Coke because I kept trying to drown my Arepa in their delicious yet very spicy hot sauce. Careful, it catches up to you.  I will now be searching my hometown or counting the days till I can make it back to Vegas to have another round at Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"Aaaah about average with or without the sauces..  Seriously it doesn't taste that good and its over priced.  We can go up the street and have rolled tacos that taste 100% better.... Walking thru the front door your hit up for money from the less fortunate, earth peeps....  No return visit for us we will hang out with Mexican's - J K KUHL..."}
{"text":"Really good! I've tried both the Pulled Chicken and the Pork Butt - and loved them both. Smother them both in the creamy/spicy sauce that comes with. Awesome!  The plantains are also about the best you can get. Order them \"Con Crema\" (with creme). It is somewhere between cream cheese and sour creme. It is fantastic with the sweetness of the cooked plantains.  Yeah, it's in a slightly sketchy part of town - but the upside is that the people-watching is fantastic. Perfectly safe during the day. Standard urban-awareness practices at night.   ...and as others have mentioned, it's just across the street from Luv-It frozen custard - a Las Vegas institution that somehow the tourists seem to miss entirely.   Definitely a great place to go if you're in this part of town - and worth a drive here if you're looking for something tasty and different."}
{"text":"Ok, like seriously, if you have never consumed an arepa, leave now, find the closest one, and eat a bunch. They are so amazingly good, and this place does them perfectly.  We were visiting in Vegas, looking for something awesome, but cheap to eat for lunch. Good old yelp, shows me Viva Las Arepas. We went on a mission and walked about 2 miles to get here from our hotel, but it was worth it. It's not in the nicest areas of town, actually it's not nice at all lol. But the place is very clean and has plenty of seating.   I ended up ordering the pork butt with avocado and tomato and it did not disappoint. It was soo good and only 5 bucks! My friend ordered the yuca fries and the plantains, and both were very tasty as well.   I can't get over how cheap and how good this place is. Awesome snack or lunch spot. Go get some!"}
{"text":"Excelente sabor autentico de mi patria! Las cachapas estan buenisimas, las arepas estan divinas!"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough. Went for the first time for lunch.  Prices may seem a bit high (for a single arepa) but the portions are huge. The plaintains and platanos and rotisserie-style chicken were all tasty. The sauces are wonderful and really round out the meal.  We'll be back again (and again). My new favorite lunch spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good!! And when I say good, I mean awesome!! I haven't had one thing on the menu that hasn't been delicious!! Absolutely go here!! Friendly service, good prices, amazing food. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Getting down to the nitty gritty, gotta order everything on this menu.    Yo! You have got to try this place out.  If you're looking for a quick fix or craving for some straight up authentic food this is the spot.   I got the #1 carne asada aka Wood grill beef arepas, #7 chicken arepas, #12 shredded beef with plantain arepas, and cheese empanadas.  Took one bite and said \"whooo whoo whoo!!\" It's like a sope and taco in one. A little greasy but can't get authentic without a little grease. Made my day. Chillen with food coma.  Interior is clean. Service was nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD ! What can I say about this whole in the wall . First let's go with the establishment super cute and clean I loved the vibrant colors . The  kitchen is set up with a window display ; which I love because I'm always curious with other cultures food delicacies and want to see how it's being prepared . I ordered a shredded chicken firewood arepa that arepa right there is the reason I'm typing this yelp review . everything we ordered was amazing but that arepa right there is why you receive 5 stars ; but don't get me wrong that's not it's only thumps up great staff and the guy was super patient with us ; if I have to change my review it's because I obviously tried something better and I want to inform you guys of what other great things they have . Best believe I'll be back"}
{"text":"Stopped by here today...  food was bland for me. I liked the Cachapa and their sauces. The ham and cheese arepa was decent. The shredded beef empanadas were good but a bit greasy for my liking. The Tostones weren't the best but to be honest I've only ever had a few that I've liked.  Venezuelan food just may not be for me.   The service was great and the gentleman behind the counter was extremely nice."}
{"text":"I can official say that I (really do) Love Arepas. Like Paolo D. I had the lengua and tasted the tripe arepas. Highly recommend both.  For those unfamiliar, here's a quick description lifted from wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arepas): \"Arepa is a native sort of bread made of ground corn, water, and salt which is fried into a pancake-like bread. It is either topped or filled with meat, eggs, tomatoes, salad, cheese, shrimp, or fish.\"  Paolo D. and I came here on a recommendation from Nelson Q. Best recommendation ever. I've had arepas before and they were usually overly greasy or their filling was under-seasoned, but this place hit the spot. Maybe I got lucky and ordered two fillings that I really enjoyed, but I was one happy camper after having an arepa.   The one downside is that there's absolutely nowhere to sit (this place is in a kiosk-like location in a parking lot in downtown -- think food truck without the wheels). Also I was really confused about how the ordering/paying worked because the guy working the cashbox really didn't seem to know what he was doing."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The service is quick and the staff is always friendly. I love getting the empanadas because they are the perfect snack if you're not too hungry. The reina pepiada is always a great choice! I just tried the coconut pastelito recently and it's my new favorite treat! A great place to go any time of day."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, relatively expensive for the type of food they serve"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb for cheap arepas and empanadas. Their sauces are so delicious, I ask for extra green salsa it's spicy and yummy. Close by our hotel which is the stratosphere so very easy to get a late nite bite in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Viva las.......Vegas. As for the arepas, well there's always pupusas.   I've tried the arepas once before when they were selling them from the little shack on Dino's parking lot and they were kinda good but nothing I would really get addicted to, so when I found myself in the shady neighborhood looking for other kind of addictions I decided to give arepas another try. Service is good, they were friendly and very patient with me while I read both menus one in English and the other one in Spanish, the one disadvantage of being bilingual, (or drunk) you read everything twice.  The new location is nice, spacious and clean, but the booths are kind of small you can literally take a bite off the persons arepa seating in front of you which could be good thing depending on who you're with, so if you're not interested at all in counting your companion cavities pick a table for more personal space. There's also a long communal table along the window with a view to a beautiful 7-11 and other independent entrepreneurs working around the area. you can eat and do some window shopping at the same time.   For the food I ordered the garlic shrimp and the pork butt arepas, the shrimp arepa was very good but the garlic flavor was very intense,(still present 5 hours later) and the pork butt was a little too salty and there's nothing I hate more than salty butt.  Still,  this is a very popular place and most people find the food here tasty and palatable, as for me I don't see myself waking up in the middle of the night craving arepas so if you see me late at night around the neighborhood, arepas is not what I'm looking for.   #clean #good service #ok prices"}
{"text":"My father is from Venezuela and the food here is better than the homemade. What an outstanding meal!  The Arepas are truly outstanding!  The Empanadas are just as good!!!"}
{"text":"The food is mostly great though they might want to label which arepas are cold and which are hot so customers are aware.  I love the black bean and cheese arepa.  However the workers are the worst here. Twice now I have ordered online and when I come in they pretend like the way they do things is to make us when you get there...why have online ordering then?  So that is 2 stars off.    The last star is because the lack of eye contact, amiability and general customer service when dealing with the humans who operate this establishment. Also, they might need an Aesops fable to teach them that lying is bad.  Just an idea.  Thanks.  Ps the creamy green and dark green sauces are basically the drink of the gods!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"A really unique find outside of the Vegas strip. We ordered the shredded beef, woodsmoked carne asada, and grilled chicken arepas, and also a few of their empanadas. Portions are good even though they look small. All were small in size but were packed with a ton of meat and are pretty heavy. A few of us ordered 2 because the arepas looked smallish in size, but  could barely take a bite out of their second one.   Minus 1 star because the meats needed a little more flavor/seasoning/spices. We were glad that they had the two sauce options but both were incredibly mild and we really needed a spicy sauce to round out the arepas."}
{"text":"Four stars just because There is only one vegetarian option but was totally worth it! The plantain fry was amazing too!"}
{"text":"I love arepas, but I have not found a place that satisfies me...until now- this place was no disappointment at all! The arepas are delicious and very authentic. I reccomend the Cachapa con queso, it is so flavorful  and is pretty big. The workers are extremely helpful and attentive. Pricing  is affordable and it's totally worth it. Wish they had one in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I have only eaten the supposedly vegan arepa.  It's bread, black beans and avocado.  Each time my husband and I have been here we have gotten a stomach ache. I'm pretty sure there is egg and/or dairy in that bread. (their was an arepa truck in town, they had a labeled vegan and when I asked they told me the ingredients!)   Anyway, I'm not really a fan of this oily greasy weird bread nor really any bread in general. I guess this just is not the place for me!  I have problems with businesses that seem whishy-washy when the actual owner can't spout off the ingredients off the top of his head and just says \"get the vegetarian, get the vegetarian.\"   The two times we have been here the place is empty but the service is slow yet very frantic.  Can't say we didn't try."}
{"text":"There are more hidden treasures than you think in Vegas. If you want to get away from the gliz and glam of Vegas, and get good, cheap, hole-in-the-wall food, this is the spot!  Other than Tacos El Gordo, I didn't know of any other hole-in-the-wall places. This one is good!  The arepas were delicious. It's like tortilla but better and less doughy. They also have a good family size bbq platter to share."}
{"text":"I frequent Viva often on my lunch breaks. The food is always delicious. I've had the #7 which I like alot. Its super creamy and filled with flavor. #1 is good also its like carne asada with tomato, lettuce and onions... But I usually get mine without the tomato and lettuce. I like to add the two sauces to mine. There's a creamy sauce its almost like a creamy cilantro sauce and a hot sauce. I've also had the shredded beef empanadas.. they are small, soft and a little sweet. The prices are good you could probably get a Arepa and a drink for $10 or less."}
{"text":"I never had Venezualian food before but I enjoy a food adventure.  The arepas are a real treat.  I split 3 different ones with my friend and loved them all.  The woodfired beef and chicken had a slightly smoky flavor that complemented the arepas.  The sauces add more latin flavor.  I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and it was delicious! Friendly people and helpful with deciding what to get , i got #12 on the cashiers recommendation she said its one of the most popular ones. There like a pocket sandwich or a gordita but they are really generous with there servings. Very clean and family place with alot of seating areas indoor and outdoor for the summer days. They have sodas and also fresh fruit waters, which are very good and not to sweet .I'll definitely be back to try different ones ,thanks again !!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great, friendly service. Clean, bright, and spacious environment.   Every meal I've tried from the menu stimulates my taste buds. A family favorite is the arepa de la reina pepiada. It's a must-try, but I would also deviate and try other options because everything I've tried so far is made to be bursting with seasoning and flavor.  The vegetarian option is good too"}
{"text":"Awesome food, something different if you're more familiar with Mexican or Brazilian cuisine.  It's like having grilled Brazilian meat slices in a crispy Greek-style pita."}
{"text":"A quick word to the wise - this place might be a stand on the side of the road, but the food takes awhile to prepare.  The freshness is well worth the wait, but if you are pressed for time, don't expect to order and walk away quickly.  When we approached the window of this fantastic little food stand, we must've looked puzzled, because a woman quickly gave us the rundown on the whole menu.  She told us her favorites, ordered for herself, and then told us, \"This place is really good.  I should know, I'm from Venezuela and I love the way they cook here.\"  Emboldened, we walked away with two arepas.  We had actually had arepas before, in Brooklyn - they are kind of similar to the dish some parts of Mexico call a quesadilla.  Thick masa is formed into a pita-type shape, or sandwich-style, around delicious fillings.  I think these might've been even better than the ones in NYC.  The masa was crunchy and chewy all at once; the fillings were boldly seasoned and complex.  My favorite was the Reina Pepiada.  It was a chicken salad with peas, and it was the bee's knees.   I followed one of my cardinal rules for unfamiliar Spanish-language foods - if the title isn't a direct translation, its probably a regional favorite, and it was.  Very excited that there's cheap and delicious food easily accessible from either Fremont or the Strip.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time we are at Vegas we have to stop here at least once.  One of the best Arepas I have ever tried!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile So finally the other day I hit it. Not impressed. It wasn't bad really but it didn't rock as very authentic. I love street food and this looked so third world street food I was pretty excited. Wasn't very tasteful, It was okay but Chicken and Pork were average. Cant say I have been to VZ but didn't make me want to go for the food. It was okay but not anything to behold."}
{"text":"A lot food for the price. So delicious and amazing. Great flavor and quality of meat. The salsas were so good too. Love the service too! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"There are some places that are so good, and your eating something that is so good, that your brain turns off and you go into munching non-stop mode. I can't explain how much I love the food here. They got me on a 2x weekly stop. Cheap prices and excellent food in a food trailer/restaurant/takeout joint. I'm so hooked on this place that even writing this review thinking about the food again makes me want to stop writing, jump in my car, and get some arepas! And I might just do that. Keke. I'm not kidding, some of the BEST food in Vegas is here. OK, i'm going there right now screw it."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! First time trying Venezuelan food and I am hooked on this place. Loved the pulled pork sand.. and the OMG plantains!   I will be back and blogging on this place! One very happy customer!"}
{"text":"Authentic Venezuelan arepas and empanadas!! Very tasty and crispy dough, if you go try out their malta polar, best malta ever. And of course, must try their cilantro sauce!!"}
{"text":"I had the Pollo Asado Mechado with avacado and cheese this week and it was amazingly delicious. I'm back again to try another delicious meal. Great service and awesome food."}
{"text":"A-MAZE-ING! These arepas are so tasty- my sister and I went twice in three days (and we were only in town for four!) I'll be recommending this to any of my friends going to Vegas. If you're staying on the strip- it's worth the drive. Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Venezuelan food. I know, I am Venezuelan.  Cachapas were authentic, arepas with any of the fillings were flavorful.  I recommend the Pabellon, Reina Pepeada. Came once to try them and had to come back next day for more"}
{"text":"This is the only place in Nevada and California that you will get to experience truly authentic Venezuelan food that actually taste to perfection!  Their tequeños are golden crispy on the outside and soft dough on the inside, and you can tell they use either imported cheese from Venezuela, and if is not, then it's a cheese that resembles it very well... YUM!  When it comes to the Arepas, it gets even better. Made with authentic corn mix \"Harina Pan\", they're soft, warm and very filling. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner! My favorite one is the shredded beef Arepa; I like adding cheese and avocado to it.  If you want to drink something typical from Venezuela, I definitely recommend having your arepa with a whole sugar cane & lime juice; it tastes kind of like a very sweet and sour lemonade.  ¡Muchas gracias a todo el staff! Hasta la próxima... -Paella Girl-"}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you visit Las Vegas and are looking for a nice and affordable place. The food is amazing, it will also fill you up fast."}
{"text":"Arepas were pretty small and boring. Overall below average even though the shredded meat was good."}
{"text":"Viva las Arepas! Absolutely. Everything here is yes. If you haven't been you must go. Beef arepa, beef empanada, mango water, and yucca fries. The pork butt is a hit a well. Such cute \"sandwiches\" packed with flavor. It will make so much sense in your mouth. You will be enlightened, my friend."}
{"text":"I love their chicken arepa. The sauce is fantastic too. The service is great. It was closing soon and we didn't feel rushed which was great."}
{"text":"The pabellon arepas with a fried egg and that cilantro sauce taste so delicious definitely going to have to come here every single time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Never had Venezuelan food before, and this place was Delicious! Had the \"Reina Pepiada\" that's what I recommend"}
{"text":"We've stopped in Vegas, enroute to other places, three times now just to eat here.  It's high quality, highly authentic Venezuelan food.  I love the Arepas Pabellon.  The plantanos hidden inside is an extra treat.  I always order the Parchita (passion fruit) juice.  It's fresh and delicious!  We also had Reina Pepiada Arepa and Tequeños.  My entire family can find something they love on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, The food is super tasty, service is great and very authentic food. Its been open for a week and I already visted twice."}
{"text":"So good and cheap! Super nice service open early at 8am until midnight. I would definitely come back here. We tried the chicken, vegetarian and shrimp arepas. The plantains are deep fried and sweet. A must try while your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The meat is super tender and delicious, partly due to the mesquite wood smoking process they use. Quick service and polite staff. A must stop lunch stop for cheap but epic eats. I also recommend the brown sugar limeade for a different treat!"}
{"text":"Clean interior. Off the strip but well worth a Lyft ride. They have a menu in English and Spanish and many options to choose from.   All Arepas are gluten-free, which is surprisingly non-existent at the major hotels on the strip.  My wife and I tried several of the Arepas plus coffee and a traditional lime and sugarcane drink.   Our favorites were the Reina Pepiada, which is chicken mixed with avocado, mayo and cilantro as well as Cachapa, which is corn and cheese. I tried an empanda as well, which was good but not on the same plane as the arepas. Each arepa is very big with generous amounts of filling.   They are made to order so you know it's fresh.  The gentleman who took our order (I think he was the owner) was very friendly and even gave us a few things for free because we ordered so many arepas (we have a hard time choosing)  Wish they had a location in Denver so I could eat there more often.   Definitely go and try when in Sin City."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place for a gigantic dinner. Recently visited Goodwich and Art of Flavors in the same plaza, and knew it wouldn't be long til I'd be downing arepas, too...  Scouted out the menu online, cross referencing it with reviews here, and ultimately decided on the #1: shredded beef and the #7: reina pepiada, plus a side of fried yucca. Total came to just over $15, which was a bit pricey IMO.  The arepas were unique and tasty, but fell a little short of my expectations. The shredded beef was a little on the dry side, but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too, but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites.  Luckily, the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky, it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got, most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.  Service was okay: minimal but friendly, brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria, but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in, all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself, I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380. For folks advertising inside of a restaurant, that seems a bit unrealistic, but what do I know.  Might come back and try a few different flavors, seems like the BF and I could share three- they look deceptively small but they're very filling. But I'll definitely be adding on the yucca.  Side note: though a lot of other reviews mention the lengua arepas, and they look AMAZING, they no longer carry lengua here. So sad about that! :("}

{"text":"Once I found it, after going into their prep area since it also has a sign & is in a building, saw the little stand literally on the corner. After getting my lecture of \"you've got me sitting outside in 100 degree heat & I don't even know what I'm eating\" he took a bite. after the 2nd bite it turned into nods, smiles (his mouth was full) & upon swallowing \"I'll have another one & 4 to go\" before the 3rd bite.  Owner was great, even walked outside & around to personally hand me each of my vegan gluten-free arepas.  They named this place great because after trying it, we can each say \"I love arepas\""}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas has it all.  I prefer restaurants with fresh ingredients, new and creative flavors, served by an attentive staff in a convenient location. This is Viva Las Arepas all the way!  I don't know how they do it, but everything I've ever had here is amazing. The only problem is that I struggle to order anything new since what I've had before is already so hard to choose from.   The fries and black beans are really great, and they offer generous portions of each for only $3, great for sharing.  The Arepas of course are the specialty, but I don't think I've seen an entree there that didn't look great.  Unfortunately, the location is a little bit sketchy for some, but I look at it as their loss. Yes, it's not the nicest area of Las Vegas, but it is right near downtown and a convenient stop before heading to any of the uber-trendy bars in the area.  Priced for lunch, Viva Las Arepas might be the best value for food in all of Las Vegas. I don't know anywhere else that offers so much fresh, amazing food for under $10."}
{"text":"Places with lots of gluten free options make me so happy. The staff was SO nice, the place is bright and clean. It was fast and everything we had was yummy. I would definitely go back and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Not bad. The mesquite gives the food a good flavor. The empanadas are good but not Argentinan good. I had the Reyna was ok. Would be better if it had avacado. This place is ok and would try it again. It's not ok"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic arepas.  The garlic shrimp and the #7 (grilled chicken with avocados, mayo, and cilantro) are must haves!  The empanadas are also very tasty along with the grilled chcicken thighs.  Can't wait to go back to try different flavors of arepas."}
{"text":"Ah, Viva Las Arepas, how you hit the spot!   Especially for gluten-free folks who crave a good sandwich (not one on dry bread that falls apart).  The cold chicken salad \"Reina Pepiaea\" arepa, black beans and rice with vegetables...  The Roasted Pork Butt arepa es muy delicioso!  And they even have vegetarian options.  I love this place!  It's always busy, too."}
{"text":"This place is a secret little slice of food heaven. Everything they make ia amazing. My love is for the Shrimp Arepa, then pork, then beef. My 5 stars should speak for themselves. So happy to see them grow from a tiny shack, across from the titty bar, to a legit building (took over the asian bbq on the corner, in the old tower records shoppibg center)They need a food truck. Hear me, Arepas? FOOD TRUCK!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! The staff was friendly, the owner took pride in the food he served! I will continue to recommend this place to people! AMAZING!  We had the wood fire chicken and the number 12. Also the passion fruit juice was legit!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with a buddy when he made this recommendation for lunch.  I was and am normally for anything once.  We rolled in and parked, and upon entering I found the other customers where a cross section of those that are out and about on the strip.  I followed my buddies lead and ordered up an areas with roasted pork butt ($5.00) and a fried egg (.99).  For a beverage a passion fruit drink ($3.00) was ordered.  The meal was delicious and filling.  I thought I should have ordered more but the maize and it's contents contained within were divine.  The drink equally complimented.  Because I have nothing else to compare to...it's a 4 star for now.......for now."}
{"text":"This was first Venezuelan food and this place is great! The food was awesome and my food was ready in 10 minutes!I got that pabellon and wood fire pork ribs for my husband and chicharron &yucca for my son - great!!! Great!!! Love it that even my husband was speechless!!we will come back! :)"}
{"text":"Never had traditional Venezuelan food before but this hit the spot!  Can't go wrong with any of the arepas offered here!  If you're near the strip, make a stop here!"}
{"text":"We love the food here.  We always eat too much.  One arepas per person and one appetizer per four people trust me is enough The bbq mixto platter is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I liked it...I'm Venezuelan and I can tell you this place represent very well Venezuelan's street food...Arepas, tequeños, empanadas, pastelitos, pollo en brasas, yucca...Everything taste good, keep in mind this is not a gourmet place,  portions are good, service is fast and friendly, prices are super affordable for the portions."}
{"text":"My relationship with VLA has gone up and down over the years, but this new location really seems to be trying to do things right. The menu is affordably priced, whether you get an arepa ($5-8) or opt for a  whole grilled chicken meal (~$20, feeds a family).   I come for the arepas and there's one for every meal- the Perico is a favorite with a breakfast slant, filled with scrambled eggs, tomato, onion, and ham. Add on a squirt of salsa verde every few bites and it's amazing! My lunch picks are the Reina Pepiada (which is like a chicken salad with avocado and cilantro) or the shrimp salad (fresh, plentiful, cold, consider adding avocado). Though the stuffed hand-held pockets look small, they pack a pretty big portion. The black beans and fried yucca are good add-on options if you're a bottomless pit or have skipped a couple meals.  The same sweet older guy is always working when I stop in. He's always friendly and the food is out pretty quick. Check the posters by the register for off-menu specials, like wings (10/$8) and empanadas."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I got a cheese arepas and it tasted sweet and savory at the same time. My husband loved his wood fried beef. The server helped us decide what to eat, which was very helpful. Very delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here And it did not disappoint.  All good items were jam packed with delish flavor!  The owner asked if I had been here before and I said no.  He than says \"since u haven't been here before, how about I throw in some plantains on me?\"  Heck yeah!!! Also very delish!  Talk about going above and beyond for the customer.  They were also crazy busy yet he went out of his way to make sure we had a good experience.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone.  I'm a sucker for free food! NOM!"}
{"text":"It says a lot about a business when they offer the ingredients for sale because they know you're gonna come back for how they make it. With that said we ordered a variety of the arepas and with the suggestions of certain additions(fried egg, cheese and avocado) they were phenomenal. I say that because our table was completely silent as we ate. So obviously overwhelmed by the flavors that we were speechless. Combined with the fresh mango fruit juice I ordered. Made me forget that I also ordered a to-go order of their asada fries. I ate those at home after my kids went to bed and I don't feel guilty."}
{"text":"Buen lugar y buen servicio, les recomendaría hacer la reina papiada con papa, zanahoria y pollo, no de la forma en que lo hacen(como en salsa), Ponerle un toque de azúcar a la masa de la empanada para que le den gusto. De igual manera los felicito, buen lugar para recordar lo bueno de nuestra"}
{"text":"YESSS...! I finally got to try this place out with the siblings yesterday afternoon!  We all ordered 1 arepas each... Sister had the Wood Fire Chicken Shredded, brother had the Wood Fire Beef, and I had the Carne Asada with avocado and cheese. We also had Fried Plaintains and Fries (LOL). One word: awesome. We pretty much devoured everything, and the mango juice I also had was cool and tasted fresh (ice was unnecessary).  It was pretty clean in there, but it wasn't busy either. Sister said the one Downtown gets overcrowded, so this is a nice change of pace and setting."}
{"text":"Wow great food great service great price get the chicken arepas more flavor then asada also the special is 3 chicken thighs and rice and beans can't beat the price $6.49"}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are great, and the service is excellent. If in downtown Vegas, definitely worth going"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp. Very inexpensive and really good. I got the chicken arepa and my son got the beef arepa the green sauce is delicious wish was a little thicker. My hubby got the chiken special he liked it very much too. We will come back again"}
{"text":"This is a good, inexpensive place not far from the Strip. The empanada was my favorite part of the meal. Plantains were also cooked to perfection. The gelato spot next door was perfect for dessert."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place a while ago because I knew we'd be going to Vegas and I wanted to try a new place. I've never had Venezuelan food before so this was a bit of an adventure. The neighborhood around this place is dirty and sketchy, but inside the restaurant it was a lot nicer than I expected. I was expecting it to be a hole in the wall, but it was situated more like a modern fast food joint. I ordered the pork butt arepa with avocado, cheese and fried plantains with a soda. My Mom just got their sugar cane and lime drink, she was going to split my food with me. My Dad got the cold chicken with cilantro mayo arepa (I forgot what it was called) with fried yuca and chicharrones and a mango juice drink. We got the drinks first. The sugar lime drink was ok, it needed more lime and was kinda watered down. My Dad's mango drink was way better, one of the best things we had here. It wasn't too thick or sweet. It was almost creamy and had a mild mango flavor. I wish I had ordered it.   My arepa was ok, I expected the pork meat to be like carnitas, but it was more like average pulled pork. I tried my Dad's arepa and it was a lot better, I liked the cilantro mayo. The sauces they gave us were good, one was spicy and the other was a cilantro sauce. They enhanced the flavor of my arepa, made it better. Our sides were the best out of everything. The plantains were sweet and a little crispy. The yuca and chicharrones were great and even better with that cilantro sauce. The yuca was crispy and starchy. The chicharrones were a bit dry, but they were meaty and of course great with the cilantro sauce. I was just kinda disappointed in my arepa, I think next time I'll try their grilled meats instead, if I come again."}
{"text":"Having it for the first  time the review is factors in my state of shock, on how good this  was, but also because its the first time i have ever had an Arepa, as I inhaled the first one, I thought to myself why did it take me so long to find out about these.  I ordered the wood fired chicken and beef arepas. The lady at the counter said the chicken was their most popular. So I took that one, and a beef one. After having both, I have to say I was much more impressed with the beef. It was tender, juicy and that creamy cilantro sauce (or atleast that's what I think it was) was impressive. I think that would go great on anything.  I am going back for the roasted pork butt arepa, and I am not sure, but I know for a fact I will be going here often. The meats were juicy and great flavor, but the real star was the actual arepa, it was dense but not dry, and had a great soft texture on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. if you had a pupusa before, it has that similar taste.  Love the vibe of the place, everyone was friendly, and it's just a great place to go and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Very delicious.  Had chicken arepas, rice and beans, and plantains.  Arepas and plantains were delicious.  The beans weren't quite as good as I expected - but I am most familiar with Cuban black beans, so maybe that accounts for the difference.  I would definitely return and think you should give them a try!  Oh, also, the LEFT menu is in English, the right in Spanish.  Don't stare at the wrong one for several minutes like a dumbass like me.  :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to this food stand downtown several times over the last year and I have never been disappointed.  I always order at least two arepas, but that is always too much food for me because they are NOT stingy!  All of the drinks they offer are delicious, my favorites are the tamarindo and passion fruit.  The black bean and cheese and reina pepiada arepas are a must try."}
{"text":"My first time here was very good however they had just opened for business that evening so I think that may be the key. I actually am more into the Arepa than the filling in itself (haven't been wowed  by their fillings yet). But my second trip here was a little disappointing.   I ordered their menudo arepa and this time not even the arepa could save this extremely bad tasting menudo. The menudo was not seasoned enough and that's not something you want to do when serving menudo:(. The Arepa was very bland and dry like it was either left on the flat grill too long or it was reheated one to many times.   The setting is so unique and I do love that so I'm not giving up just yet and do plan to give this place a third try I just hope to be able to post a more positive update. I really do like the staff and they are always so pleasant."}
{"text":"This place started as a little stand right outside Dino's and he had so much business that he was able to get a bigger more proper place right across the street.  Needless to say, I've been going since it was the little stand and I had no idea what an \"arepa\" was.   It's magical Venezuelan goodness.   :)        The food is always great and the people watching can be very interesting at the intersection.  Lol  My favorites are the \"pernil\", tostones and fried yuca.     Oh.  And when they ask if you want cheese and avocado...  yes.   Yes you do."}
{"text":"What a great a great experience. This place definitely lives up to its hype. We had the beef arepas, shrimp arepas, and the pork but cheek arepas. Wow they all were delicious. Next time we're trying the chicken!"}
{"text":"Vivas las arepas. Yum. I wish I lived here. I would eat you everyday. The white sauce in the bottle makes everything taste better. I swear they must put some of that Vegas crack in there.  It's freaking addicting. I seriously go through withdrawals when I go back home. For years now, this place has changed... They've grown and expanded. But two things remained consistent, service and food. Great service every time. Amazing food every time. That's all I ask, and Thank you for delivering! Not a bad thing on the menu. Check out their drinks as well, often overlooked. Weird. I never have enough of it."}
{"text":"A little late hopping onto the Viva Las Arepas but at least I did! First time trying arepas and boy was I blown away. I would pick arepas over tortillas any day. I am a lover of anything doughy and the texture and thickness of the arepa was just perfect for me. Add in some deliciously seasoned pork butt and beef and you have a heavenly combo! My favorite would definitely have to be the pork butt. It was perfectly seasoned and the meat just melted in your mouth. They also have a house cilantro-garlic sauce which was a perfect pairing. In addition to the arepas that I got, I also got an order of the pork rinds and yucca root. Pork rinds were delicious but the fried yucca root was the star. They tasted just like French fries! except much better because the outside was super crunchy and the inside was flaky. Yum-O.   ONLY downfall is that it is located downtown (which I am not a big fan of). Overall, this place is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Really loved the food here even if I did find 2 shrimp shells in my garlic shrimp arepas. Also had the reina pepiada arepas which I thought was better than the garlic shrimp arepas (even if I wouldn't have found shells.) And finally had the tequenos which was great as well. 2 arepas are very filling though. My suggestion would be to have 1 & one of the sides unless you're a starin' marvin. Will definitely have to head back some other time to try some other items."}
{"text":"Very tasty!   I had #7 and 9 with plantains.  Best meal I have had in Vegas yet.  Believe the reviews."}
{"text":"Just like the sign says, \"I Love Arepas.\" Although delicious Venezuelan food can be found in Miami, I was a little skeptical when it came to Las Vegas. However, this place holds up to the scrutiny. We wanted to give it a try and because the arepas were so cheap ($4-$6)  we ordered one of each...literally, one of each variety. Needless to say, I got full pretty quickly and ended up trying one bite of everything. DELICIOSO!  My favorites were: -black bean -shredded pork  The guys working in the stand/shack were super nice. I will definitely be back the next time I have an arepa craving."}
{"text":"Talk about value - tasty arepas for less than $5. Looks small but makes a good meal, and you need some room for gelato at Art of Flavors next door after that anyways. :)  I usually get Reina Pepiada or shredded beef, both of which are very good.  A big YES."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing from the bread to the meat. Everything I got melted in my mouth.  Never had Venezuelan before but I'm now a fan! Everything I had was extremely tasty.  Really affordable for what you're getting. It was clean and they were really quick. I can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"First time here we sampled a bit of everything this place is worth stopping for. Delicious corn arepas: pork butt, shredded beef, garlic shrimp, and chicken yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Excelente servicio. Excelente la comida. Y domingo en la mañana me sentí sentada en la casa de mi mamá. Todo lo que pedía me lo ponían en la mesa y más. A dream come true. Los tequenos exquisitos. Los pastelitos recién hechos, las empanadas mundiales. El masato como hecho de mi abuela. Ni hablar. Una experiencia inolvidable. Félix you made my day."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I go to Vegas.  The sandwich fillings are what make this place special along with the Arepa.  Also, this place is a great gluten-free option."}
{"text":"The pernil arepa (pork butt) was soo unbelievably salty that it was hard to finish. Too bad because I love arepas :( The fried plantains were really good. Bad location on the seedy side of the strip with a small, awkward parking lot. Good, friendly service though."}
{"text":"Great concept and great food! Everything in the restaurant is gluten free, so if you have a gluten intolerance or are celiac, this is a great spot for you. I've always loved arepa's and empanada'a. This place makes really good clean food with a smoky . roasted mean stuffing or cheese and ham. The Latin ladies that work in the kitchen add an extra not of authenticity to the crafting of the food. If you crave something different then you will love this place. It's more a take it to go kind of place than an eat in but the place is done up very nicely if you decide to stay for your meal."}
{"text":"Nice inexpensive option off the strip. Arepas were good and I had an order of plantains. I think the plantains could have been cooked a little more, they were still a little firm, and the crema tasted like straight up mayonnaise, which was odd. I would like to go back and try more things to get a better feel of the place. Service was friendly and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Soy Venezolana! He viajado a muchos estados por trabajo y conozco muchísimo restaurante venezolanos vivo en California y por vacaciones nos vinimos a Las Vegas cuando estamos explorando me encuentro con un restaurante de mi país me emocione a mi máxima expresión .... Al llegar la persona que atiende ni habla español ni se sabe el menú bien, yo dije bueno no importa quizás es nuevo no importa que no hable español no importa estamos en USA ok no hay problema, pero que la comida que se espera por más de 20 minutos no te guste eso sí es verdad que no me parece. La verdad es la primera vez que escribo algo negativo para algún negocio que sea de mi país. Pero la calidad de la parrilla es mala la carne es muy mala súper dura y muy poca porción el pollo fue puro hueso y bueno ya no digo más."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is Venezuelan and I love eating Arepas when his mom makes them. But this beats any Arepas I have tried so far. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Hubby and I liked it! Fresh food, gluten free! Very friendly staff. We walked up to the counter and told him we had never been and he gave us great info. We had the beef, pork and garlic shrimp arepas; plantains; and fried yucca. Delish! I tried the sauces and enjoyed those too. We'll come again when we visit Vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"VIVA LAS AREPAAAAAASS!! great place to eat ! Just like in Venezuela cachapas,chicharron con yuca, malta Polar...cocosetes! Thank God for our original Venezuelan food being available in Las Vegas, great food, great service..... MADURO HIJO E PUTA !!"}
{"text":"All the arepa trucks in Vegas have seemed to disappear so my bf and I decided to give this place a try. I'm glad we did because the arepas are just as good, and they have a great lost of options on their menu (like cachapa, yucca root with chicharon). My favorite was the reina pepiada arepa. Felix the owner is wonderful. Although the setting was like a fast food establishment, he came over to our table when it was slow and introduced himself and even gave us plantains on the house. We got to talk to him a bit and afterwards he even offered to throw away our trash when we were done! Great service and food."}
{"text":"This is some good eating all the way around. Sorta was bomb, and the coconut cheese thingy a must. F yea, grub"}
{"text":"Insanely good, we had the Reina pepiada arepa, chef grade arepa. The flavor of the grill, i mean, oh my god this was crazy good  Que sigan así, hacen a un Venezolano orgulloso"}
{"text":"This place has seriously great Arepas! Every time I'm on or near the Las Vegas strip I must stop and get one or two. They are extremely authentic. They taste just as good, if not better than the arepas I had in Columbia.   I highly recommend Viva Las Arepas! The stay is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This place blew my mind. My boyfriend were in Vegas a few weeks ago and I was trying to find an awesome place for us to eat off the beaten place. I went on yelp and found this. The pictures made me want to try everything.  We got the Yuca fries. Their signature chicken arepas with the cilantro sauce. INCREDIBLE. We also got the Carne Asada and Carnitas arepas. I love the fact that they grill the meat over an open fire.  It was so good and so fun to just try a little of everything. Can't wait for my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"First time back here since they moved out of the little stand on the corner of Wyoming and Las Vegas Blvd (which is now a vacant taco stand) and into the former location of Harry O's BBQ.  There are many more items on the menu now, which we plan to come back and try (grilled meat plates looked really good).  But today we were here for arepas.  We ordered four: wood fired beef and chicken, plus shredded beef and roasted pork, plus an empenada to share.  It did take a while to get our food, but that tells you that it's prepared fresh to order.  The plan was to each of us to take two, eat half of each, and then swap them, so we could both sample all four.  Halfway through the first one I realized that one was going to be my limit.  I started with the roast pork; my wife had the wood fired chicken.  They were as delicious as I remember.  We ended up taking home the two beef arepas.  The person who helped us was very friendly, he wrapped up our two untouched arepas, boxed them, gave us little containers of sauce and bagged the whole thing.  Definitely plan to come back here soon.  This town has such a great selection of ethnic dining.  We're seasonal residents, who normally live in the SF Bay Area (which is a real melting pot itself with great ethnic dining) and we are constantly finding little hole in the wall restaurants with great ethnic food.  If your idea of dining out is Outback Steakhouse or Olive Garden, you are really missing out."}
{"text":"I loved the beautifully stacked wood out the back on the way to the bathroom. It showed how serious they are about wood fired meat. The wood fired chicken plate was fabulous, the arepa's were the same as everyone described them -tasty, good value, and freshly made. I LOVED the passionfruit drink, the soursop one was a bit weird, the lime and sugar cane drink was good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick breakfast. I ordered the vegetarian dish, plantains and the passion fruit juice. The personnel is so sweet and welcoming, and the restaurant is spotless. Oh yeah and the food is SO GOOD! If you're in Las Vegas, and you are looking for cheap, quality food go here!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Delicious! I had their Papellon arepa and plantains with passion fruit juice and it was nothing short of an amazing meal. The service was friendly and fast. How I wish this place was in my hometown."}
{"text":"Aji sauce is the best I've had! I had the paballon arepa, mister had the pork one. We also got an order of yuca frita and tostones. Everything was delicious! Drank a maracuya which was good too!"}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious Venezuelan food! (For the record, I'm of Venezuelan heritage on my mom's side.) I haven't eaten Venezuelan food in a long time, but Viva Las Arepas definitely walks away with a home run!  All the food is made fresh to order; typical on their menu are arepas (cornmeal griddle cakes either baked or cooked on a griddle, then split  and filled with various fillings from cheese to 'reina pepiada' - chicken salad with avocado and cheese. Other dishes include pabellon (shredded  beef, plantains, rice and black beans) and carne asada (beef, chicken or pork) barbecued on mesquite wood. If you have a sweet tooth and feel adventurous they have a selection of Venezuelan chocolates and candies, as well as pastries.  Small indoor and outdoor seating areas; parking is available in the rear of the building. Service was very courteous and arrived quickly (you order and pick up at the counter). While they do not deliver you can order from Uber Eats and they will pick up and deliver to you.  I don't get to Vegas often but this place is highly recommended and it has earned several local awards."}
{"text":"Having driven by but for some reason never making my way to eat there when it was a stand, I finally walked into their new corner location at Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd. last night.  Truth be told, I don't know how arepas or Venezuelan empanadas should be so I can't review on authenticity, just taste.  We ordered the garlic shrimp arepas and a few empanadas - cheese, cheese & bean, and cheese & guava - along with fried plantains and the Agua De Panela to drink. The taste of everything was fresh and simple, the multiple sauces, including a cilantro/mayo, a perfect addition. I was expecting the food to be heavy and greasy but it wasn't!  With items from $2-$4 and a bright, clean interior, you really can't go wrong. Felix, one of the owners, was very nice and obviously takes pride in his food.   I always enjoy a place were we can try something a little different that my six-year-old will like too. This fits the bill and it is within walking distance of my house!  If you want a quick, good bite to eat, forego the chains and drop by Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"I had to try it since it had so many rave reviews and I am left feeling disappointed.  We came in on a Friday night and I for one was super excited to go. I was game for trying something new and never had an arepa before. We ordered the shredded beef and pabellon per recommendation. The arepas were good and very flavorful. They give you two different sauces. One is extremely spicy. The other is some kind of cilantro mayo concoction, but it works and is super tasty!   The reason for the low rating is the poor customer service. No greeting and no smiles. I had a coupon from a book I got at Costco and as soon as I showed it, the cashier immediately turned it down. He was kind of rude and unapologetic about it. According to him, they \"have been trying to get the company who produces the coupons to take them off their website for three years now.\" Sounds a little sketchy to me. That in itself ruined my meal and had me feeling kind of embarrassed like I was in the wrong. Not a good way to treat a customer. I take customer service very seriously and since they didn't make a good impression, I won't go back."}
{"text":"The food here is a great find for Las Vegas! It's affordable, with great service, and has authentic food.   5 stars - Arepa with black beans and cheese. I loved this dish! The beans were so flavorful and they do not skimp on the cheese here. Even the arepa itself was not heavy and held the beans and cheese really well, so it didn't get messy while eating it.  4 stars - Cachapa. It was like a folded over corn griddle cake with melted cheese inside. It had a sweet flavor from the corn and the savory of the cheese to balance out the flavor. I liked eating this with the squeeze of homemade green hot sauce they give you in a squeeze bottle. Spicy, but good!!  3 stars - Fried plantains. I'm a big fan of fried plantains and usually order them whenever they're on the menu. In this case, the fried plantains could have been more sweet by letting them ripen just another day or two before cooking them. The preparation was spot on, with a golden brown glow because it was fried. Just a bit sweeter and this would have been a five in my book.  Overall, they've got a great selection of items, a clean restaurant, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to the Las Vegas Blvd location several times and enjoyed it. This location holds up to flavor!! The staff is really great and helpful. The gentleman at the counter recommended I get the  Reina Pepiada (chicken breast w/ avocado, mayo and cilantro sauce)and he was on point with that suggestion! I nearly scarfed the whole thing down without taking a pic. Ha ha. I also ordered the Pabellon (beef, black beans, plantain and cheese) for a different flavor profile. I'm not normally much on beef but it's shredded and marinated very well. Also delicious is the sugar can and lime water. A good compliment to the arepas. I am definitely making this a work lunch spot from now on. Along with staff being friendly and helpful the place itself is very clean and air conditioned (we all know that's a summer necessity)"}
{"text":"Delicious arepas! Meat was juicy and tender, with the arepa dough a perfect texture. By the end it was falling apart due to all the juices, but delectable nonetheless :) Although it didn't look that large, it was filling and had more meat than expected! On the other hand, it was a little on the heavier side for food.  I got the pork butt arepa (forgot to add cheese), and also a shredded beef empanada. Both were great.  Reasonable prices, ample seating, and delicious food will have me adding it to my list of go-to spots while in Vegas."}
{"text":"As we rolled into Vegas after 8 hours of driving, my sister insisted that our first stop be at Viva Las Arepas. If you decide to get hitched after lunch, come here because it's next to a hair salon, wedding dress store, and ghetto wedding chapel.  Reina Pepiada. Yes. Anything is better when you add avocado, but with chicken salad? I can't even.   We ordered a bunch of stuff to share including the Reina Pepiada arepa, shredded beef arepa, pork butt arepa, garlic shrimp arepa, chicken and beef empanadas, chicharones, and yucca fries.   I wasn't a fan of the shredded beef, it reminded me of frozen burritos. Everything else was really good. Don't forget to drench your food in the cilantro mayo, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Flavorful experience!  I've had this place on my mind for several months and finally made our way over to it for a late lunch on a weekend. It was a beautiful day and wanted to enjoy our food outside since they have a cute little corner space.   We ordered - a chicken arepa with avocado and a pork butt one with cheese. Next came a beef empanada, fried plantains and a sugar cane drink with lime. The chicken arepa had some type of sauce on it and it was way too wet for my taste. I loved the pork butt and it was my favorite part of the meal, especially with the delicious creamy cilantro sauce over it! The beef empanada was ok, expected more flavor. The plantains were fantastic and the perfect way to end the meal. I would skip the sugar cane with lime drink as it was very sour.   Here's the rest of the story and why I couldn't give it a higher rating. As I mentioned above we chose to sit outside because the weather was perfect. A homeless man came over and sat next to our table and began staring at me. It was nearly impossible to enjoy my food and we ended up buying him food. He chose to sit next to us and eat it as he continued to stare me down. Then came over a couple who were high as kites and the male wanted to show us his junk. He was committed to this and with every passing minute was also screaming at his female friend. I wanted to crawl under the table.   So next time I'm siting inside no matter how beautiful it is outside!"}
{"text":"The garlic shrimp and vegetarian arepas were excellent. My friends loved the ribs and plantains."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is Venezuelan, so we had to try this place. The reviews say it all: delicious. The taste is pretty close to the authentic arepas from Venezuela.  We ordered the Pabellón and the Pernil Arepas, the cheese and carne mechada empanadas,  and the guava and cheese pastelito. Everything tasted great!   The pabellón arepa comes with shredded beef, black beans,  plantar and cheese.  The Pernil arepa comes with pulled pork and cheese, I added avocado too. If you're in las vegas and looking for great Venezuelan food, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well, the arepas were very hearty and the meat both chicken and beef were very tasty.  Just not sure how healthy they are.  Wish the white bread would be some other type of bread.   Good service."}
{"text":"I love the chicken arenas! We drove from the other end of the strip, two days in a row, to eat there. The yucca fries are really good too!   We did try some of the other meats, but it was just okay.  Once, my husband bring it back to LA! Still good. Love the sauce!"}
{"text":"Love this Place!!!! Food is soooo good. Quality with great service. I swear the shredded chicken arepa is perfect."}
{"text":"I love the wood smoke flavor in their meats, and this restaurant sets the standard for me in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I loved this place and can't wait to go back! I recommend the wood fired chicken arepa"}
{"text":"Wow!!! These arepas are legitimate! Been to a few Venezuelan places and this top 3 in my books! Highly recommend to anyone wanting to try something new. #so good #money"}
{"text":"I sincerely enjoyed this place. We were passing through and we wanted to try something a little different. It has been forever since I've had a good arepa and this place did not disappoint.   I suggest the pork butt aretha and the shredded beef empanada. You can't go wrong at under $10! We got a couple and things and split it all like tapas.   That's good the people here are amazing, super friendly and you can tell they put a lotta love and what they do. It's really rare to find in a place like Las Vegas.  I have a gluten sensitivity and usually I have to pay a premium for gluten free comfort food but here everything was less than six bucks each and it was all delicious.  They have parking, accept credit cards, and there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. This is now our new go-to spot."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and do not eat very many places repeatedly.  The pabellon platter is our regular item, along with the chicken wings often on special and the best plantains you've ever eaten in your life. Been regulars probably 4 years or so.  Not long after opening."}
{"text":"LOVED my arepa #Pabellon and the steak arepa too. The passion fruit nectar was excellent and the service was fast and friendly. We all loved the food. Not 5 stars because the rice was subpar. Overall, it was all good."}
{"text":"The place is cute and clean but my 1st disappointment was at the moment we walked in.  The owner, yes the owner himself, was everything but nice......very serious, not warm or kind at all, almost rude.  I thought it was very strange that an owner handled customers like this.   Then when we got out order, my arepa was the blandest I have ever tried! - even with all the filings!.  I ordered the wood fired chicken with cheese arepa, but honestly, it was not good at all.  The dough had no taste, the chicken didn't taste like wood fired chicken but like boiled black meat chiken, and only only one slice of cheese not even melted. This is the second time I go, and wanted to give it a chance bc I didn't like it the first time either, but I got convinced:  this is another of what I like to call a mediocre restaurant. Colombian arepas are a trillion times better! And Business Owner! - be more friendly! or don't deal with face to face customer service because it looked to me you have no social skills!, which is fine.....but then don't do it!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem Hole in the wall Small crappy looking shack that serves delicious grub  All three of these phrases perfectly describe Viva Las Arepas, but I like the third one the best!  Located at the end of the strip, on Las Vegas Blvd, just a few blocks past the Stratosphere Hotel, sits a small, ugly white shack in a deserted parking lot that serves up some of the tastiest little snacks in all of Las Vegas.   Viva Las Arepas serves up some of the best tasting Arepas I've ever eaten. For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;  Lengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hA Ground Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ug Black Bean & Cheese Empanada http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQ  All three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good.   To wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q   The prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly.   If you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas. Trust ME."}
{"text":"My 1st time here was a nice experience. The food is good. You have to try the Plantains. The staff really treated us special. The food was good. and we will be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was driving around Vegas one evening looking for something interesting to eat, and I Love Arepas jumped out and grabbed my eyeballs. I immediately pulling into the parking lot to investigate.  I love shacks, and I Love Arepas is a shack. When I saw the word Venezuelan, I knew I was off on an adventure. The menu is a bit intimidating for a newbie, but the guy who work there are extraordinarily helpful and patient about explaining the offerings.  I completely enjoyed the cold shrimp item I had. While I was eating, they inquired to see if I was enjoying the food. This sort of service is more like a 1st class joint than a shack in a parking lot.  People were constantly showing up, but there was never a line. The food has to be prepared, so while it's not fast, it still gets to you fairly promptly.   I brought my wife on a return visit a couple of days later and had the same excellent and enjoyable experience. A must-stop from now on when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Located just north of the stratosphere,  this place is super inviting with the aroma of smoked meat luring you in from the lot.    We ordered two arepas each so we could try some different flavors.  They are like tiny sandwiches but made with cornmeal. And by tiny I mean actually medium-size. We each could have done with only one I ended up leaving half of each sandwich that I picked because I was so full. We also got the passion fruit juice and that was superb, perfectly complimented the arepas. The creamy green sauce was the bomb! It's like a mix of creamy avocado and salsa verde. I kind of want to put that sauce on everything in my life."}
{"text":"We kind of happened upon Arepas by accident, but it turned out to be a very great experience! Located just off the main strip, this is a delightful place to try some Venezuelan cuisine!  The restaurant is very clean and spacious. There is a lot of outdoor seating as well as indoor. There are also pictures of the menu items throughout the dining area, which was very helpful when you are as clueless as I was. The employees were all really nice and quick with everything too.   I went with the shredded chicken arepa with cheese (#2). It was very very good. It was a lot like eating a soft shell taco that was wrapped with a thick, sweet tortilla. It was all very authentic and made right then for us. There was also a sauce that was some sort of sour cream creation that made it even more delicious. It was a great first taste of Venezuela!"}
{"text":"Always stop by Viva Las Arepas anytime my wife and I are in Vegas.  My wife grew up in Venezuela and swears everything here is as authentic you can get.   I recommend the following: - Arepas: Shredded Beef, Roasted Pork Butt  - Fried Yucca - Passion Fruit Juice (Parchita/Maracuya) - Shredded Beef Empanada (note these are fried not baked like Argentinian/Cuban empanadas) - Green sauce (Guasacaca) on EVERYTHING - Cachapas (for sweet tooths)  After your meal, save room for Gelato next door (same owners).  Wait can be a little long.  Do phone-in orders to save time as area can have a bit of traffic."}
{"text":"My family is of Venezuelan heritage so I was pretty excited when I found Viva Las Arepas on Yelp. After reading tons of great reviews, my best friend and I decided to head over to Viva Las Arepas for lunch one day. Upon arrival we noticed that the restaurant was extremely clean, just like some of the reviews said. We each ordered one pork butt arepa and I got a wood fire chicken arepa as well. My best friend also ordered the beef arepa since he's just loves beef. The chicken arepa was good, the pork butt was better but the bites my friend gave me from his wood fire beef arepa were the absolute best. Everything was flavorful and tasty. We will definitely be back to Viva Las Arepas whenever we are in the mood to have some delicious Venezuelan eats."}
{"text":"I normally don't review but I just had to as I was so pleasantly surprised. Didn't look like much from the outside, don't let that fool you...Some of the best chicken I have ever tried! Half a chicken with 2 sides for 10 bucks, crazy good value for money. Cooked with mesquite wood, so it was smokey and crisp on the outside and moist inside. Tried the arepas with chicken, avocado and cilantro mayo. Didn't know what to expect but very pleasantly surprised. It's like a pita in shape but the bread is glucose free and softer. Filling and full of fresh flavor!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place through other Phoenix foodies, and they really delivered! We've only had arepas once before, but I continue to crave them because of this place.  We swung by Viva Las Arepas for a late Saturday lunch. My husband got three arepas: shredded chicken, the reina pepiada and the beef with tomato plus a side of fried plantains. I got the vegetarian arepa and a guava pastry. We loved our arepas. I usually hate plain food, but I would be very happy eating a plain arepa because the masa is so delicious. My husband said the reina pepiada was similar to a chicken salad as the filling was cold. We couldn't get enough of the spicy and cilantro sauces. The fried plantains were pretty good, but the guava pastry was a disappointment. I keep comparing the last two items to what I've had in Miami so I have high expectations.   We always drive when we go to Vegas so the location doesn't bother us. I'm sure we'll be back when we're in town to get these unique dishes."}
{"text":"Strange beginning to my debut here. The owner had stepped out when i arrived around 1pm on a Sunday, so i was left trying to order from the cook who doesn't know a lick of english (hello border patrol). He didn't understand \"#1 and #2 to go, but he did say \"let me call my boss\" so he calls his boss who didn't answer the phone. Five awkward minutes later, i yell out \"uno y dos and adios\" and the cooking got underway finally. Oddly enough, he asked in English if I wanted cheese. Both the shredded chicken and beef were tasty, but the edge goes to the beef, although both needed more peppers and onions and the promised garlic wasn't too prevalent. The chicken was kind of mushy too. The cornmeal pancakes were the best part, so i will probably focus more on veggie stuffings which would let those shine through more. The hot green sauce had much more flavor than other green buttermilky stuff, but gotta use that lightly. The cheese was a good addition for 50 cents."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this fine restaurant a number of times over the past 3 years, and visited again in late 2013. In the time since I was last here, back in October of 2012, they have moved from the small mobile/portable building in Dino's parking lot to their own storefront in the strip mall on the next block to the south, on the same side of Las Vegas Blvd. Their shop is the southernmost storefront in the small strip mall (yes, there is off-the-street parking in the strip mall).  The food here is amazing. The selection of Venezualan food, and the quality, is simply great! Their new shop is brightly lit and colorfully decorated, and the food is just as good as it was when they were in their old location just north of here.  I particularly love their arepas, but then again I am an admited arepa addict.  The service is also very good; the staff is uniformly friendly and helpful. The prices are very reasonable, and the portion sizes are very generous. I can only assume that when various organized religions talk about the possibility of going to heaven after one dies, that they must be talking about going to this restaurant on a permanent basis, for there is nothing finer on earth!  It is no wonder that this restaurant has won several local awards for best of class/type, including the Best of Las Vegas (aka Best of Vegas) award for the Latin restaurant category!   Whenever I am in Las Vegas, I always visit this fine restaurant 2 or 3 times per week and stock up on arepas to stuff into the fridge in my hotel room!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and very flavorful.  First time at this joint and it really did not disappoint. It's a very down to earth place and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The place is very clean and the aroma of the food is what welcomes you as you enter. The gentleman who took our orders gave us great recommendations for first time patrons & he was patient with us as we asked tons of questions about each of his suggestions.  It's a place that I will recommend to everyone, local or out of towners, both to visit. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"As the reviews show it's great. Come for some great food and service! Definitely will come back. Carne asada could use a litgle more flavor but still very good."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, yummm!!! During my 4-day vacation in Las Vegas I ate at this establishment 2 times. Both days I ate the vegetarian arepa which includes, beans, tomatoes, avocado, onions, and green peppers. I also had the white rice with black beans and sweet plantains. It is located in a sketchy part of the strip but the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break and the food was absolutely AMAZING! I got the Roasted Pork Butt Arepa with tomatoes on the side and it went really well with the Cilantro sauce they had. I also got the cheese empanada and mango juice which was just as equally as good! I can't wait to come back again and try the other things on the menu. Staff is really nice and attentive as well!"}
{"text":"First impressions, A small, modest sized establishment for such a well known, and raved about place.  To order you must get in line and wait your for your turn at the counter. The worker we had help us with our order was a man wearing black ( assuming his the main guy in the place )  He was v gracious with us and even went as far to describe the flavors of the different coconut drinks they had there for us! Haha   The food we got were orders #1, #7, and #13 along with many many other dishes from off the menu...  But I'll just stick with the ones that wowed me the most lmao  Or yeah  The arepas..  WOWOWOWO WOWOWOWO SO F GOOD   The outer part, reminiscent of a pupusa ( I think! ), was so delicious    I serious could have just eaten that haha, but with the cilantro and avocado chicken thing I had with it  WOW  I also had tried some of the #13 and it reminds me a lot of a sweet corn tamale except with cheese  YUMMMM"}
{"text":"Well this is my second time here  Both times come sway with the same impression.   While the food generally is fresh and very tasty the portions are child-sized at best.  If you're hungry you need to double down on what you order so don't FORGET that.    A small but good chicken sandwich with avocado costs $7.07. If I wanted to get filled up sufficiently, I'd need two of these puppies. That brings the cost for lunch up to over 14 bucks!  Not so good from the value perspective."}
{"text":"Very cheap, delicious Venezuelan food. Has vegetarian options which I was very happy with! The meat is good quality and has an amazing smokey flavor! Not fatty at all. The empanadas and arepas were amazing. They brought special sauces to your table with your meal. The avocado sauce was one of the best I've ever had.   Definitely recommend for anyone not looking to spend a lot of money and wanting to stay away from all the strip craziness!"}
{"text":"Stop in every time I'm in Vegas! Smoked pork butt arepa and wood roasted chicken and I'm fed! Good fast service and affordable for any budget. Take the time to venture off center strip to pay this place a visit, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was great, I ordered the carne asada, reina chicken arepa and yuca/chicharrón appetizer. All were fresh and full of flavor, the restaurant was nice and clean and you can smell the smoke flavor being infused into the meats."}
{"text":"Great Argentinian (authentic) food at such great prices.  I wish I had this available close to home (OC).  Every time I go back to Vegas....I'm there!"}
{"text":"The best place in Nevada to eat... The food taste really great. The service is really good. I recommend this place 100%. Viva Venezuela."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for  while, and finally my husband and I were on the right side of town and decided to give it a try. We liked it so much, we came back two days later!!! I've only had arepas a handful of times, but I liked this place! The food was made fresh to order and very tastey. They have helpful photos of the food for those of you who are also arepa rookies. I definitely recommend giving it a try if you are looking for an alternative Latin American cuisine to Mexican."}
{"text":"This food was disgusting! I would rather have eaten at MCDONALDS!  Bad combination of ingredients! I have no idea why this place has 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am feeling rather stupid that I didn't get the pun in the name of the place until now, two months since I visited. Durr. Love it. Simply put, these are delicious. There is a whole world of South American cuisine that I didn't know existed up until recently. The Venezuelans and their affinity for this scrumptious maize dough have brought a smile to my face and taste buds. You know, if taste buds had faces. That would actually be kind of creepy if they did.   We came in a wandering from one World Famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop, on our way to the Stratosphere, hungry for a snack. Arepas are perfect for a light lunch meal or snack, but only if you limit yourself to one. You'll be sorely tempted to have more. This eatery is marginally clean; there's a nice lady that comes around asking if she can wipe your tables or buss your trash. I wish water was available for self-serve. I was parched after walking in stupid shoes and would have liked snappier water refills.   All in all, this is a delicious stop just north of the Stratosphere, especially if you're looking for a more unique ethnic choice without all the flare and overdone nonsense of the Strip."}
{"text":"Good arepas and great service. My favourite is the shrimp; the chicken and avocado mix is my second. The passion fruit drink is always a must for me. For cheap and good eats near the strip, this is definitely a good place to go."}
{"text":"i love this place! best food in vegas. The empenadas, arepas, and everything else I've tried there are so delicious. If you like Latino food this authentic Venezuelan restaurant is the place to go. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Green sauce is delicious addition to the arepas which are generously stuffed with all things good food is made of. Also, the passion fruit drink is the best, definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Its hard to find arepas in Los Angeles, so I was estatic when a friend found this little joint for me (Thanks Nich!)  I Love Arepas was only on its 3rd day of being open, so of course there is always room for improvement.   Felix was very accomidating to our needs.  He said the best arepa to try was the reina pepiada which is shredded chicken, pieces of hot dogs tossed in mayo, cheese and avocado. It was light but wasnt my cup of tea. I wouldnt order this again.   Next, we had the carne mechada, which was way better!  Last, we were going to order the chicken but decided to get the pernil (pork butt). Felix wanted to make us happy so we told him if he could add black beans and salted cheese. This one was my fav! The arepas itself was very moist and not very heavy at all as opposed to Caracas in New York.  As for a place just starting out,  Felix knows he has to make some changes to the menu and the venue (adding chairs, tv outside), which i commend him for listening to his customers, as he took note of our suggestions.  The arepas are great, but there needs to be a variety of components instead of just a meat filling.   Will def be back to see the improvements that will be made."}
{"text":"This place was ok/good. I expected it to be better because it got 4 1/2 stars. Overall it was fine, but not something I would make a point to go back to. I ordered the shredded pork butt and beef arepa, and the fried plantains. The arepa bread itself was a bit mushy. The outside shell was crispier and better. For those who have never had an arepa, it is a lot like a gordita. I'm not talking about the gorditas they serve at Taco Bell, I'm talking about the authentic ones.   Beef arepa: good, but a bit greasy  Pork butt arepa: the pork was tasty  Fried plantains: nice and warm, but a bit greasy  While I'm not looking for healthy foods here, it could have been a little less greasy.  Pros:  -good hours (open from 8 a.m. to midnight, daily) -the guy was super helpful and friendly when I told him it was my first time.  -the food was fine, but not super good.  Cons: -a bit greasy -hot sauce weren't so good -the arepa bread, a bit mushy -small parking lot"}
{"text":"Amazing! Not too busy. Food came quickly. I really enjoyed the cheese arepa. We sat outside and took in the sights. Found a parking spot right in the same mini mall the restaurant was located. Right beside a gelato place and nail salon."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:  -So you're in Vegas & fiendin' for a taste of Latin cuisine, Viva Las Arepas got you. -Specifically, Venezuelan food is served here. -Empanadas to arepas (commonly found in Columbia too) are sooo good here. -You can order a few of their items & the prices are nice. -I really like the location (not the crazy Strip). -I also love the windows that let in that natural sunlight, which is the key to foodporn success.  Overall, I bookmarked this spot after eating here and so should you."}
{"text":"Seriously, coming here is the best part of coming to Vegas. Friendly service and honestly the most delicious food in the world. Everything is so fresh and the salsas bring tears to my eyes... they are so delicious and add so much to the arepas without overpowering it. I could not have better words to say about this place. You MUST come here if you're in town!!! Love from Michigan"}
{"text":"The food is quite delicious,  but I wouldn't go back if I had a big appetite.  It's a very small portion, which left me still very hungry.  I recommend it if you are looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Good food. Reminded me of the arepas my Venezuelan friends made when I lived abroad. I liked the more simple combinations like the carne asada. Pretty filling."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Haven't had anything in Vegas that compares. Everything on the menu is delicious and the prices are pretty good for what you get"}
{"text":"This was super close to where we were staying on the north-end of the strip.  We ordered a few veggie items and thought the food was ok.  Don't think we'd make it a point to visit next time we're in town!  I'm sure it's way better for the meat-eaters! :)"}
{"text":"Nice break from all the over priced and unauthentic food in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. My friends and I tried a few different arepas and each was delicious. One is probably enough. Get have everyone get a different one so you can try a variety. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is Viva Las Arepas 2nd location and it did not disappoint. Loved this location as you dont have to deal with traffic and pedestrians on Las Vegas Blvd. Everyone was really friendly and we food was great as usual. I had the Pollo Asada Arepa and it was delicious. All there meats are cooked with wood so they have a nice Smokey flavor.  This location was super clean. What a step up from the original food cart.  Keep up the good work Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"What a great find!  We were driving in from hiking all day and it was late but we were starving for something gluten-free but not too heavy.   We ended up at Viva Las Arepas.  Honestly, I'd never had an arepa or knew what one was but the pictures and descriptions were awesome.  It's all corn-based so no gluten.  We ended up with Pollo and Garlic Shrimp arepas supplemented with an order of plantanos.  I tried the Guanabana drink and man that was great.  You can also get an order of just plain arepas which I did to munch on for a very lite meal.   Recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place! they have a vegetarian option and the Arepas are delicious and good price. the special sauces are delicious and it's a chill spot. it's a little hot inside but that's anywhere in Vegas in the summer. the service is exceptional and they have fresh juice :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite  dive places in vegas. Arepas are the best. I normally order the pork butt and the #12. Plantains are amazing."}
{"text":"Off the beaten Las Vegas strip, located in old Vegas, er kinda seedy neighborhood Las Vegas. After snagging the last parking space in the strip mall, we walked in and checked out the large menu board. My husband asked me, which menu do we order off of?  I told him 'The Spanish one if you can read it'....he let out a sigh of relief when I pointed out the menu board in English on the left.  We got the chef special arepas, he got the wood fired shredded beef and I got the shredded chicken with avocado. These things are big, one will stuff you, and I got a side of rice and black beans and plantains -oink!  Those arepas are the bomb, chicken is shredded tender and smok-d-lish, is that a word?  Mesquite grilled and so good, corn meal pita or whatever it's called is fresh and chewy, holds all that filling. Two salsas, a creamy green garlic aioli and a fresh green salsa, both are habit forming. Plantains were sweet and tender black beans and rice so plentiful, we couldn't finish. Place got the lunch crowd going out the door.  Great place."}
{"text":"Yumm! Although they have good food I need to try other menu items to really give them a better rating. The Pork Butt Aprepas that I was dying to try was a little too slaty and a little bit soggy. So unfortunately that really was a disappointment.  The guava cheese pastry sounds so good on the menu but all it really was was guava jam with half melted weird cheeses deep fried in a pills berry type dough kindda good just couldn't get use to the cheese and the jam had a weird fragrant unguavay flavor.  My favorite out of the meal I got was the deep fried yucca with pork belly nuggets sooo good but it looked weird. I would recommend trying it because it's trendy and the yucca was bomb but expect to pay and arm and a leg those 3 small items cost me $18 or so!"}
{"text":"This place was truly delicious, it left the vegan and meat eaters of my family fully satisfied!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while looking for somewhere  to eat while on vacation. So glad we decided to come here. The arepas are amazing and like nothing I have ever had. Will definitely come here every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Number 4 and number 12 .  Number 4 is good but 12 is amazing.  Mango drink also good."}
{"text":"Go here. The food is amazing at any price but happens to be really cheap. The staff were all really friendly, and helpful. They answered all of my many questions and helped me choose what to get. Had a beef arepas, a chicken arepas, and some black bean and cheese thing. It was all stupidly good. They had a weird cucumber sauce I loved too."}
{"text":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-MAZING!!!!!  love everything about it...well, almost....the only thing I don't like it the price of each arepa, BUT the taste is worth it, so I'll dish out the cash.... I will mention that I come from a community (outside of Las Vegas) where I used to get arepas and other Latin@ delicacies for under $3...for Vegas, I LOVE AREPAS is perfect!  Maybe they should offer a \"Locals\" deal :-)  Just a thought..."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant last week and rounded up a couple of my guy friends who love a food adventure. None of us had ever had Venezuelan food before.   When we arrived we were greeted with enthusiasm. Since we were novices to this country's food we ask him what he recommended. #1, 7 and 12 are the most polilar of the Arepas. We also ordered the Fried Yuca.   We ate our selves silly. The food is amazing. The Arepas bread is so different.   Definitely going to tell my other friends. And will be going back to try something new."}
{"text":"Tried this place once a little while ago and really enjoyed it. The staff was super friendly, explained the menu to us since it as our first time there and first time trying Venezuelan food, so we had no idea what to get. Got two different types of arepas, the Reina Pepiada which was so good and very healthy since its chicken breast with avocado, and the Roasted Pork Butt which was also really good. We also shared an order of Fried Yucca Root which was really good to try, can't just find fried yucca root anywhere. Overall a great experience.  But it is located on the north end of the Strip, kind of a sketchy looking area. Parking is really small, pretty much just a few spaces right in front of the place then its the road."}
{"text":"Never tried Venezuelan arepas before but heard about them -- and landed in perhaps the best place to start the experience! Small restaurant at the transition between the main attractions on The Strip going into Old Town, Arepas is a small homey place offering mouth watering arepas. We tried the Reina Pepiada (Chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro), Pabellon (beef, black beans, plaintain and cheese), and Wood Fire shredded Chicken, along with Perico (scrambled eggs, black beans, tomato, peppers and onion). Each has its own unique flavors, but they are all so tasty! A good alternative to the usual chain and buffet restaurants in sin city. Definite plus."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I drove by this place and made it a point to eat here while on my visit. It was the best decision I made the entire time I was in Las Vegas. I didn't want to do anything too \"Vegasy\", so I avoided the strip and the fancy restaurants in casinos. I also didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg for each meal. Enter Viva Las Arepas. The arepas are fresh and flavorful. I tried the roasted pork and, after the first bite, my eyes rolled to the back of my head and I smiled euphorically. So good. So so so good. I wish I had more room in my belly to fit every arepa they made. The empanadas were amazing. And the platanos? Fried perfectly, like my mom makes them. Get the sugar cane and lime juice. You'll never want a regular lemonade again. The staff is super friendly and helpful. If you can't decide, they'll help you whittle your options down. If you're visiting Las Vegas and you want something a bit different, you MUST stop here!"}
{"text":"In my lifetime I've only ever had Colombian arepas made by a couple of my Colombian friends. These didn't disappoint! I got an all chicken arepa and one with an avocado salsa. While I loved the avocado one loads better, they both tasted delish and were freshly made. The air conditioning sucks in there, so take out would be a better option. If I'm ever feeling arepas, I know where to go."}
{"text":"My husband had been here before and loved it, but he made me ordered the mixed grilled meats for 2 people so I was not able to taste the other more authentic type dishes so I may have to retry this place and see.   The portions are a good size. We came here for lunch and the meats included half a chicken, some sausage, beef and pork with rice and a salad.   I wasn't a fan of the salad dressing. I couldn't figure out the sauce, but it did have some type of salsa in it. The rice was very dry so I pretty much just ate the meat.   They are known for grilling with mesquite wood, but my chicken was just a little overdone. The beef, pork and sausage were really good though.   I didn't have room for dessert today."}
{"text":"I use to go to this restaurant when they first started out as a food truck (loved it back then, the food had actually flavor and the prices were reasonable) Now that they've open this restaurant the food has been down played in flavor for all the white people - this is a disappointment! I bought a plate last night for my boyfriend and I, It's been awhile and I wanted something different. Ew, it was only 8:15 and the food we received was all dry, from the rice to the beans to the damn chicken! None of it had flavor and it was all dry and hard - I was SUPER disappointed. I loved them when they were a small business, now they're overrated.  I won't be suggesting this restaurant to my fellow latinos/hispanics (I'll look bad)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since \"the old days\", when Felix ran the stand and would try different recipes, giving away free food many times. I have to admit that the place doesn't feel as \"personal\" now that it's a real restaurant with a store front, with many employees that don't necessarily know what they're serving. Having said that, I think the food is as delicious as ever. Even if Felix isn't making the stuff himself, he runs a tight ship, and the quality is maintained. I think it's the best tasting, and certainly one of the most interesting, restaurants of its category!  Be sure to check it out and experience it for yourself!  The Reina Pepiada is my all-time favorite!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT miss this chance to get Arepas, if you are visiting Las Vegas. Do not fail to support a local business, if you are a resident! On our first visit, I had the reina pepiada (chicken/avocado) arepa and my husband had the pabellon (shredded beef) arepa. Both were so delicious!! The masa wrap was crisp but tender, and the fillings very flavorful. We've since tried most of the fillings, and every arepa has been fresh and tasty. This is a far distance from Mexican food; but f you like a little heat, there are Venezuelan hot sauces on the tables.  We've also had the pastelitos, and while we didn't think they quite as good as the arepas, the fillings were very flavorful. The Venezuelan sodas are exotic enough to be worth a try too; but my personal favorite drink is the \"Agua Panela\", sugar cane with lime. I love any drink that involves raw sugar cane, and in this one the lime cuts the sweetness just right but not so much that it tastes like limeade. I have two standout memories from my first visit. First, I wanted to try the yuca fries, but my husband was being a little conservative about them. So we didn't order...but the owner brought over an order for us to try anyway, on the house! They were so good and crispy, and I've ordered them ever since. My second memory is of the wood stacked in full view of the dining area, so you know they are always smoking that meat right in-house.  I also have to complement the owners on a bright, folksy, and clean atmosphere. It was a pleasure to sit there...reminded me a lot of small cafes we encountered in our trips to central America...but with air-conditioning, LOL! Very affordable eating for \"The Strip\"...please get out of those casinos and try this and other local businesses in our fabulous city. By the way, the very best gelato place in town, \"Art of Flavors\" is right next door (that's not just my opinion, but I totally concur); so save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"Never had Venezuelan food before so this spot was a must as soon as I drove by.  The staff was friendly especially the little older lady at the cashier.  Just like mama!  The menu was easy especially with the giant pictures on the wall.  Food was amazing.  I orders the three most popular arepas.  1. firewood beef with cheese and avocado delicious and hearty.  2. Garlic shrimp favorite but gets really soggy if you don't eat it fast.  3.  The Chicken pep avocado salad too yummy.  The arepas itself were soft and fresh.  The best part about it is that they give you your own personal bottle of their 2 signature sauces which are to die for.  Can't wait to come back and try the rest if their menu.  On my things to do list is the \"pork belly\" can't wait!  - eat greedy..  yours truly Mizz Loveli"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to really expect when I first came in, a lot of Yelpers had been commenting that VLA had changed since they got more popular. Jacked up prices and less meat, I started to regret not visiting them when they were still in their shack.   A friend paid me a visit at work so that we could go out for lunch, we had both never tried VLA so we decided to try it out. Walking in I looked at the menu and prices and wow, talk about over priced. On top of that, they charge you extra for the cheese which arepas normally have, so that felt like a rip off, that's like ordering a cheeseburger but you have to pay extra for the cheese, but I get it, they're trying to make money. I ended up ordering two arepas, a reina pepiada and carne asada, I also got a coke, my total, over $13 for such a small meal, the arepas are about the size of grocery store hamburger buns, so they're a bit on the small side.The cashier was very nice and helpful, my friend didn't understand what some things meant and she explained them to her.   We didn't wait very long for our food to come out, maybe about 10 minutes tops. I first bit into the reina pepiada and it was really good, but after a few bites I was over the sauce which is made with avocados and cilantro. The carne asada was my favorite, the meat was finely chopped and it came with one leaf of lettuce and one sliced tomato, but the heat of the carne asada cooked the tomato so I picked it out, yuck. One thing I can't stomach is cooked tomatoes so next time I know to order it without it. Both arepas came with a decent amount of meat and both were flavorful as well. I loved their green salsa, it had the perfect amount of kick.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal, price, not so much, but I will be back because they know how to make some pretty tasty arepas."}
{"text":"I had never tried an arepa before. I ordered 2 a wood fired chicken and a roasted pork. The pork was my favorite but everything was fantastic. The sauces were terrific and the bread was unique (and very tasty).  Next time we head out to Vegas, we will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Wood Fired Beef/Carne Asada Arepa, Wood Fired Chicken shredded Arepa, and fried plantains with a Passion Fruit beverage by way of recommendation from the staff.  I preferred the Chicken Arepa with the creamy garlic sauce.  Yummy Yum Yum"}
{"text":"The arepas themselves are perfectly cooked and could stand alone, but the fillings are exceptionally flavorful!  I loved guava and cheese fried pastry that somehow ended up on my plate. I think it's called a pastelillo. I would order it next time.  Much more interesting than food on the strip and a great price.  The Service was also friendly."}
{"text":"Ay que delicioso!  Literally I come here every time I'm in vegas. Best breakfast place in town!! Last time I was there I ordered the pabellón arepa which is unbelievable. So many savory and sweet flavors all in one place it's almost impossible to describe with words.  For dessert I ordered the cachapa with cheese and because I've had them before I personally Loved it. For ppl who have never had them imagine a pancake made out of corn topped with melted cheese. So it might be a little too sweet for someone who's not used to the flavors.  Get out of your comfort zone and check this place out! Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the shredded pork and avocado chicken salad arepas. The 2 sauces they give you to put on everything work perfectly together and are awesome on everything.   I also love the shredded beef empanada and the beef pastelito.   It's off the beaten path from the strip (closer to downtown), but something different (and definitely much cheaper!) than your usual steak or buffet options."}
{"text":"We were told by a local that this was \"the place\" in Vegas for Arrepa. But not after dark, and ignore the bars on the other buildings around...  We meandered down early in the morning (for vegas standards) so we decided to enjoy a little brunch. We had a couple of the arrepas and learned they are definitely too messy to share very well. But they are huge!! The fried plantains (not tostones) were ok, they needed a little more caramelizing for me!  All in all, i'm thinking i'm not really an arepas gal...  which is a bummer.  The location although weirdly in the middle of the strip, but walking distance from the Stratosphere, is very cute and the staff - family owned - is really friendly and don't rush you in your decisions!"}
{"text":"Garlic shrimp Bacalao Reina pepiada Black beans and cheese Chicken and cheese"}
{"text":"Third time in Las Vegas, and this place is AMAZING.  Hands down...some of the best food in town.  I'm comparing to High-End 5 Star cuisine.  Fresh, delicious, well made, and always with a smile. This time I was with family....we all ate well but my four year-old stuffed down an Arepa Pepieada, a Empanada, a large papaya juice n something else.  My kid NEVER eats like that.....another good sign."}
{"text":"After seeing arepas on the many food shows and driving past this place several times we finally stopped to check it out.  I'm just sorry we didn't stop sooner because the food is to die for!  Anytime we are even close to the downtown area we make it a point to stop.  The Wood Fired Beef and the Roasted Pork Butt Arepas are a MUST and make sure to try Shredded Chicken Empanadas too!  They definitely have to refill the bottle of creamy cilantro garlic sauce after I leave, that stuff so addictive!  Run! Don't walk and get yourself an arepa here, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Admission: I really don't know arepas. VLA was my first - and they were gentle and considerate. We tried 4 or 5 different kinds; the pabellon was absolutely delish; the cachapa (corn and cheese) was surprisingly nice and delicate. I thought I'd like the reina pepiada best but actually I wasn't crazy about the taste - kind of tart and not much body or complexity to the flavor. Note that 1 arepas is not quite enough for a full meal for a grown adult, so order 2 if you're hungry (about $6/each). The up-side is that you can easily try 2 kinds, or just order 1 for a snack. We also tried the beef empenada which was nice (different than mexican empendas), and the fried plantains, which sweeter and softer than say Cuban plantains - almost like supermarket bananas - but still tasty.  It's far enough from the strip that parking isn't a hassle, and the service was fine."}
{"text":"So good I have to keep coming back whenever I'm in town. I am Gluten Free and the options I have when eating here is amazing! I recommend the #7, 12 and 13"}
{"text":"Don't know what this green source is but I kept pouring on my sandwich.  Omg speechless."}
{"text":"WOW!! As close as I have come to Ecuadorian deliciosness!! Fell inlove with they're food!!"}
{"text":"Non-existent service. I just ate lunch here. The chicken, while it had a good flavor, had mostly charred skin to the point where it was beyond charred; it was just burnt. I asked for a cup of water, and I literally got that. I got a warm cup of water that had no ice in it. I would have loved to have asked one of the staff if I could have some ice but they all disappeared, I don't know where to. This was the second time I have been there, and it will be the last."}
{"text":"close to many of the places we like and we enjoy the odd food.  worth a try.  have fun!   parking good though a challenge at times.close to the freeway."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD IN LAS VEGAS!! This diamond in the dust was only a 1/2 mile from SLS hotel!!!  THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! I LOVE FOOD and this place definitely won my stomach over. I had a 7 day stay in Vegas and I found this location on day 3 and after that I was there everyday for at least lunch or dinner. On my last day I had lunch there then returned to get something to have for my flight.   The food is made to order. Everything is authentic, fresh, and hot. The staff was more than nice to explain any questions about the food and they gave the best recommendations.   If you are a foodie, then this is a must stop location.   I will definitely put this on my must stop at again when I return to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"**Updated Review** I'm changing my review from four stars to three. The reason being is mainly the service. I understand that this is a hole in the wall joint, and I'm all for that, but if the person taking my order cannot even understand English enough to take my order, we have a problem. The girl clearly was not competent enough to take our order. She kept trying to flash her smile, but that's just not going to get our food ordered. I had to ask for the manager twice. Pretty sad. Kind of ruined her whole vibe of this place.  Also, I have read other reviews which state that it is dirty inside lately and I would have to agree. Why is no one dusting off the tables and wiping down the chairs? While this place was on my mind this morning as I had a craving, I can say that I probably will not be coming here when that craving hits in the future...     I've been here a number of times over the years.  This is an easy get in, get your food, get out place.  It would be awesome if they had more than one vegan option, but I will take it nonetheless. The black bean and guac is absolutely delicious!  I do wish they had more salsas that were vegan. And maybe even more sides. But hey, let's stick to what the plus sides are here. This is an authentic Arepas hole in the wall joint with a super small menu and low prices.  The service is always friendly. And you see them making your food.  When the craving for in arepa hits, this is my one spot in town!"}
{"text":"So driving by I saw a sign and the only word that registered was AREPA.  I said to myself, man I love Arepas and that was that (I had already eaten that time).  So I was gonna get some frozen custard and hit up Dino's and realized this was the same spot and it was actually called I Love Arepas, so I stopped in and got one.    You might think one is not enough but damn they are filling.  It's also a little messy and the sauces they include don't help but it tastes great!  My only complaint is how much accouterments come with it.  There's the paper it's wrapped in, the paper that's put in, the plastic things for the sauce and all - none of it compostable but then again that's just my San Francisco hippy-ness coming out.  It's Vegas after all!"}
{"text":"Delicious! So happy to work near here. Always delicious and great vegetarian arepas too! Amazing price makes this place 5 stars hands down."}
{"text":"Very fresh & delicious! Very nice people. I eat off their food truck every first Friday. Great food & very nice people. They also have great fresh juices"}
{"text":"Cehat a clean and lovely spot on the strip.   Food is always tasty and fresh.  One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"I had only had arepas at fairs. It was cheese and that's it.  I've been driving by Viva Las Arepas for a month now. I was tempted.   So I came in today and was blown away by the flavors. Food made fresh with passion. Wow!  I had the carne mechada, and loved it. For me, one is enough. The two sauces, one spicy (not too spicy in my opinion) and the cilantro mayo are fab.   Great spot. Now I need to try the others on the menu."}
{"text":"If you have no idea what an Arepa is, don't worry, like no one does! But they're delicious!   I went with a couple coworkers this morning and was really glad I did. The guy running the register was super nice and was happy to see us even though it was our first time there. He made some recommendations and threw in some samples of other things he recommended for next time we visited.   I went with the shredded chicken arepa and the shredded beef. They were both delicious.   The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because I asked for both of them with no cheese and I had to eat just the meat on one of them because the arepa had cheese on it.   Recommend you go check it out!"}
{"text":"Have no idea what took me so long to try this place since I have been going to Dino's (where they had a pop up) for a looooong time and live in the area. Went here for lunch and we had a variety of the arepas: beef, shredded beef, shrimp, perico (breakfast), and the pork butt along with rice and beans, plantains, and mango juice. Bottom line: everything was -AWESOME-. You can absolutely taste the wood fired roasting process in every bite which makes me want to come back next time and just get a mixed meat plate. The employees definitely has a passion for their food and it shows as service is also outstanding even though it was busy during lunch. The only slight complaint is that it's a little pricey ($4.00 for rice and beans) but I'm definitely willing to overlook it given exactly how good the food and the service is."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE best venezuelan food i have had in the city. Shown this place by a friend and his girl (who is venezuelan) and ive been hooked ever since. I drive from henderson just to have a #7 w/cheese and a cachapa. Amazing variety and highest of high quality food. Never a bad experience in 3 years and never a concern about incorrectly prepped or cooked food. always spot on. Keep up the great food gang. Viva las arepas!"}
{"text":"meh it's ok, it's pricey for what you get! was cool to try but I'm not in a hurry to eat there again"}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty. They give you plenty of sauce and have sodas from the old country. The arepas are excellent!"}
{"text":"Got the wood fired beef with cheese and cheese empanada. The woof fired beef was so amazing. You could taste the smokiness from the wood and to be honest didn't really need any condiments to pair with it. However, I love hot sauce so I POURED the hot sauce on top of my first bite... And to my surprise, that had a good kick to it. The other sauce was a mild cilantro/avocado-mayo sauce. Also very delicious but I preferred the heat. The Arepas was a good size because the meat in it was kinda heavy so, I'd just order one portion.  The store was really clean and the employees were very helpful in helping select an item since it was my first time trying Venezuelan food! I'd highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Omagawd! These things are soo good. Their so addictive. Their like fluffy popusas cut in half and stuffed with chicken or beef. Their salsas aren't spicy by any means, but their so good. Kind of expensive which is why I limit my self to a monthly visit. And the tables and bathrooms are always really clean."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month if I can. Food is great. Service is excellent. Best Arepas ever!  Whenever my family visits we go here."}
{"text":"Wow, I have passed by this place of a restaurant they call Viva Las Arepas, an authentic Venezuelan eatery or so they say...literally it's on the signage. Could this be a gimmick of those never ending self proclaiming best in Las Vegas slogans? The curiosity got to me by family members and friends visiting this restaurant only to give good reviews...and so it tickled my mind to ponder and search on Yelp what the hype was about this snazzy independent spot.   Upon checking it out on this review place called YELP...the high ratings were affirmation ... So the reviews speak for it self and with that my taste buds were now wondering how good it really is.  Wifey and I decided to check it out. The location it self is off Oakey on Las Vegas Blvd...just a few blocks away from the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The area is known for its tourists but at the gate way to downtown the homeless lurk with mostly innocent intentions, maybe a few bad apples once in awhile.   If you are not familiar with the area, I recommend checking them out day time and or with a group of people.  Upon entering the vicinity, the bright walls and shiny tiles capture an artists eye like a palette of colors inviting and pleasing...accompanied by a delicious aroma welcoming you to an open space floor plan. The prices are average at around $5-6 dollars for a nice size portion. Just know that it is fulfilling that with the variety of choices you will have to come back...and that is what I plan to do.  The wifey and I decided to go with #1 Carne Asada, #4 Roasted Pork & #7 Reina grilled chicken breast with avocado...all equally delicious. Would have love to try more...but definitely next time I will be back."}
{"text":"The best arepas ever! I honestly loved the cheese one and how simplistic yet tasty it was. The beef was also very good! I miss this place already!"}
{"text":"Just wow! Not sure what all the stuff is? Just start at the top of the menu and work your way down."}
{"text":"Reina Pepiada is my favorite arepa!  Moist and delicious.  Not expensive, very filling!   I would pass on their empanada."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn in writing this review.   I've had Viva Las Arepas (VLA) bookmarked for the better part of two years now, hell maybe more and it wasn't until recently had I been able to finally stop in.   I love that there are still highly rated,  non-boojie, cheap, no frills food near the strip. I love even more that it's Venezuelan food.  Unfortunately, I may have been driven by the hype so much that I was left slightly disappointed.   After a very long, grueling work schedule, my beau (bless his tired heart) was sweet enough to bring me here because I listed it on my top 3 places to eat while in Vegas.  We drove up to VLA, which isn't a stand anymore, they've transitioned to a brick & mortar. The parking lot is shared with other establishments and can get crowded during peak hours.   The menu is large enough to spell some confusion for those salivating tastebuds. I know these arepas can be filling so I definitely had to strategize my meal. The man just got himself a carne arepa (non shredded) and 3 shredded beef empanadas. I got the pork buttt and carne arepas in addition to a chicken empanada.   Our plates came out hot and fresh within a few minutes and those empanadas were super hot--so hot that a piece of it was left thrown and regurgitated back onto our tray lol (wasn't by me though). We enjoyed both empanadas though I will say the shredded beef was better than the chicken. We also both agreed they needed more meat in them.   I love the arepa itself, and they generously filled 'em with our protein of choice. Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed with their beef. It was tough and lacked flavor. Even with all that drippy sauce, there was just something amiss with the beef.   The pork butt I did enjoy. It was moist and tasty, and once I was carb loaded, I picked out all the pork and gobbled it all up.   As cheap a meal as I thought it would be, we still paid $30++.   Overall, I'm saddened this long sought bookmark didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try."}
{"text":"The first time I\"ve ever had empanadas was my bff's mom's.  They are Colombian, and there's not too many places that serve them, but I use hers as a comparison point to all other empanadas I eat.  Viva Las Arepas is Venezuelian style and has several different kind of empanadas.  The most similar to what I am used to is the shredded beef kind.  The masa is deep fried and crispy, unlike the baked Argentinian kind that is easily found in OC.  (Although they do have the baked kind as well, beef and rice, but it's a square shaped instead of the the half moon shape).  The taste is great, the beef soft, but there isn't too much filling in there.  The beef and rice ones have a lot more filling.  As for the arepas, again, I am used to the Colombian kind, where it's served on the side, plain, as a bread with your meal.  At this place, the arepas are used as bread to a sandwich with fillings inside.  We got the pork with tomato, beef, shrimp, and chicken.  they were all good to be honest.  I think I like the pork/tomato and chicken the best.  You have two sauces to go with them too.  I have no idea what they are, but the light green on isn't spicy, and goes great with the shrimp and chicken.  The red one is spicy and goes great with the pork and beef.  You really only need one arepa with one empanada and you are full.  We got 6 arepas and 8 empanadas, and the total came to almost $50! o.O Yikes!  The chef/owner asked us how many were eating with us, and I was kind of embarrassed to say it was just us two.  He gave us some deep fried cheese sticks on the house since we told him we were just ordering a bunch of stuff to try.  Those were good too.  Oh FYI he no longer serves lengua or tripe. :("}
{"text":"The only complaint that I have are their prices are way too high.. for the year 2015.  $3 for simple frozen fries.  Nothing special.  They should price that at $1.75.  $6 for Arepas would be o.k. if it was bigger..  They should price these around $4.25  $3 for small Empanadas..  They should price these for about $2.25  $3.50 for fruit drinks..  They should price these for about $2.50  All my friends agreed that the prices were a bit too high and probably won't be back.  If you purchased one Arepa, one Empanada, one order of fries and a fruit drink, the grand total would be about $17 with tax.  But at least the food was decent."}
{"text":"Loved the place, very authentic and friendly.   I'm married to a Colombiana that spent much of her life in Venezuela. So there is an extensive influence of the food in our own diet at home.   It was very nice to find a bit of home cooking 2500 miles away here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The arepas are bomb but I come here for the Pabellon or chicharron con yuca. Just finished lunch but already want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when I was walking to Fremont st. They make some of the best arepas I've ever had. Must try the beef arepa that is cooked on a wood grill, very smoky and delicious. The arepa is crisp and not doughy. The servers are very friendly.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I ate here three times during my two day stay in Vegas. I haven't had great tasting arepas since I studies abroad in Venezuela seven years ago. The beef, chicken and jamon con queso arepas were solid. I will never visit Vegas again without eating a few meals here. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, you have to try the pork arepa with tomato.  Add cheese and it is oh so good!  Unless you are starving or can eat like a trucker, you will likely only be able to eat one of these beauties.  Which makes it a full meal for around $4.  Yay!  They also gave me cold green salsa and ranch dressing (at least I think it was ranch dressing) that went so perfectly with my hot sandwich of the gods.  Not really thrilled about eating out in a parking lot.  The nearby pedestrians were a little shady and made me a tad nervous.  But take out seemed easy and probably the better option.  I just hope they expand, maybe to Naked City Sandwich Shop's old location.  They have their sign up there already.  Just take over the space."}
{"text":"What a transformation! The humble little arepa shack on the corner has grown up into a bright, clean cafe with a great menu of Venezuelan specialties. Besides the usual arepas and empanadas, they now offer wood grilled chicken and other meats. The selling point? $8.49 for half a chicken (or serving of another meat) plus two sides! Considering the location on Las Vegas Blvd, expect this place to fill up quickly at lunchtime, attracting workers from downtown and tourists in search of a deal. You'll pay about the same for four small tacos de adobada over at El Gordo.  The chicken is marinated in secret Venezuelan seasonings and grilled over wood and charcoal. My husband gave this pollo al carbon a big thumbs up. On my visit, the smoke from the grilling process overwhelmed the room, but the owner reassured me that this issue was being resolved immediately. Order at the counter, take your number, and wait for the food to be brought to your table, or to-go is a great option if smoke is present. For $19.99, the parrillada mixta serves two people a nice variety of grilled meats. Pork ribs and Pabellón (the official shredded beef dish of Venezuela) also stood out on the menu. Sides include rice with veggies, black beans, salad, chicken soup, and plenty of fried carbs. My favorite is the tender and crisp yuca, though I also enjoyed the patacones (smashed, fried plaintains) that look like bananas rolled over by a car tire-- in a good way! The french fries were pale and soggy, so something went wrong with those. Unfortunately, the mixed salad had a strange flavor that made me quit after a few bites. It seemed fresh, so I'm guessing the lettuce absorbed some of the smoke coming off the grills. I don't really eat any smoked foods, and I won't be adding smoked salad to my diet anytime soon. Venezuelans cook some of the best black beans (caraotas, in their country), and at Viva Las Arepas, white cheese is crumbled over the top. These caraotas with a side of sweet fried plaintains or yuca fries, a cheese empanada, and passion fruit juice to drink make up my ideal comida! The creamy green sauce and creamy red sauce (salsa Golf) are essential. I rarely pass up a pastelito (guava or coconut) for dessert.  Admittedly, I grew up eating these foods in Florida at various Colombian and Cuban joints, and some of the side offerings at Viva don't quite match the flavors I crave from home. They are already doing a very good job, and if they tweak the recipes a bit and clear out the smoke inhalation risk, I won't be able to stay away from this place. Family friendly (high chairs and a changing table), salsa Golf, occasional reggaeton (spare us the bachata, please!), and very cheap eats. ¡Chévere!"}
{"text":"Small Venezuelan restaurant that serves arepas: small bread pockets filled with delicious meat and veggies. The arepas are delicious and surprisingly filling; I usually get the pork butt and it is juicy and flavorful. This place also serves amazing woodfired chicken that can be ordered as a 1/2 chicken combo or as a whole chicken. The combo comes with 2 sides of your choice. I usually get and would recommend the rice and fried plantains.   The owner has been featured in the Weekly and works as the head chef in the kitchen. He sometimes will come around to greet diners, but I have seen that happen less often now that the lines have gotten out of control during the lunch hours here. I'm craving some arepas now as I write this review...if you haven't been here yet, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a casual, clean place. The service was very friendly and the food was addictive. We had the Shredded beef and cheese empanadas and wood fired beef and chicken arapas. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Their arepas are AMAZING! It was my first time trying this but it was a perfect fit to my taste buds. Location is couple miles from the strip and the plaza looks old but it is nice inside the restaurant. The arepas also come with two sauces in a bottle. You can use it as a spread for the arepas and it is absolutely delicious! It is spicy, savory, and creamy! It went so well with my food! The cashier, George, was also very patient when I was ordering and knowledgable about their menu. It is not cheap cheap but compared to other restaurants and buffets on the strip, it is cheap and worth it for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastically close to the Stratosphere, making it easy for me to justify running over for a quick lunch. This has allowed me to sample a large portion of their arepa offerings, usually by ordering two at a time; one to devour sitting at their stand & generously doused with their delicious sauces and one to go, for when the first digests enough to make room for it. This means I usually order one of their hot ones (for now) and the cold (for later); the Pork Butt and Tongue are my fave for the hot while the Reina & Garlic Shrimp are both boss for cold.   The Pork Butt is a winner. If you like pork, get it. Rich, tender chunks of flavorful pork drenched in juices? Yeah, it's even better with avocado.  I really enjoyed the Tongue arepa, too. The beef is tender, there were decently sized chunks of tomato and aromatics all nestled between those little golden cakes of fluffy/crunchy delight.  If you like chicken salad, the Reina is a tasty Venezuelan version wedged between the delicious griddle-fried masa cakes.  The garlic shrimp were a decent portion of shrimp in a buttery garlic sauce that soaks into the bread the longer it sits.   Even the cold codfish is pretty good. They mix the cooked fish with a flavorful blend of seasonings and veggies/aromatics. It doesn't overwhelm with the stank o' fishiness, but you still know it's there.  They also offer a few other things, but I always grab an arepa.  I'll diversify once I've conquered their entire Arepa menu!"}
{"text":"Really good food, but wish there was more food for the price I paid. Got the pulled chicken which was delicious with the green sauce, but was still hungry after that."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find off the beaten path in Vegas. While I'll tend to agree that the area seemed a little shady, it is in a heavily trafficked section of Vegas so I wouldn't be too worried about it.   As for the arepas, they were delicious. We went with the carne mechada and the reina pepiada. Both were filled to the brim with meat and other delicious fillings. I also tried an interesting Venezuelan soda drink that reminded me of a fruity cream soda.   The food came out quick and the service was friendly. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I discovered this place after falling in love with Art of Flavors, next door..go here after 1pm so you can grab dessert there afterwards, if you have any room left that is!  My husband got the wood-fired chicken arepa and it was delicious! We also shared 3 empanadas--a beef, a shredded chicken, and a black bean and cheese.   In the arepa, the chicken was perfectly seasoned, and complimented by the sauce and veggies. On it's own in the empanada, the wood-smoked flavor was a big too strong for my tastes, and I found myself using lots of their delicious hot sauce to mellow it out. The black bean and cheese was more mildly flavored. I liked that it was whole beans vs mashed like I had been expecting. My favorite of the three was definitely the beef! It was so tender if was falling apart but it seemed like a combination of shredded and ground beef, and it was fantastic!!  The restaurant is counter service, and the employees were extremely friendly. They weren't busy (we were there early) and they brought our food to the table. It was bright and airy, and spotlessly clean. They also have a nice little patio for seating.   We will be returning, I can't wait to try that delicious beef in an arepa!"}
{"text":"I'm usually extremely happy with this place by my last visit is just that, my last visit. When my order was ready someone else walked up at took it to their table thinking it was their order. After the mistaken patron took my food, he sat with his girl, handled the food for few minutes, opened the wrapping and finally realized it was the wrong order he took it back up to the counter to explain he had the wrong order. I watched as the lady at the counter decided to fix what the mistaken patron has done and serve the tainted, already handled by strangers, food and serve it to us. F**king gross!!! I will never go back and recommend you pay attention to how your food is handled here. That was definitely against the rules of proper food handling and sale. It's sad because I really liked this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS food and the woman who helped me at the counter was not only happy to make suggestions but when she realized I was unfamiliar with the dishes, she thanked me for coming in and trying the food with a HUGE smile on her face. Portions are comfortably large (enough for 2 meals for me). Very, very fresh. I recommend the Pabellon and the chicken Empanadas. Also tried the guava and cheese pastry....wow."}
{"text":"First time trying venezuelan food.  Overall, very good flavor but pretty pricey..... Either way, I would be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Catchy name for this place. I had high expectations of this restaurant from the number of raving reviews. I bookmarked this place for our Vegas trip as it seemed like the place to be. I ended up being disappointed from the experience. This was the second time I had arepas. The first time was in Orlando and I didn't like them either. Something about the thick bread and soupy toppings just doesn't work for me.   The arepas are quite large and filling. One per person is more than enough. We decided to order 5 between the 3 of us to try different flavors which was way too much food. Too much food was wasted. I would have appreciated the man who took our order to let us know one per person would be enough. He even asked us if we had been before and we told him no. This location is in a sketchy part of town, so just be aware of that.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the passion fruit juice. But it was juice. Super sweet and sugary I'm not going to go crazy over juice. Long story short, if you like arepas, you would most likely enjoy this place. I did not."}
{"text":"The food is very good here! We made a point to come here for a quick lunch. We drove out of our way for it and it had been on our mind for many months since we had noticed the sign. Service was not the friendliest. This was a bit of a disappointment along with the emphasis of a tip option when paying. This is not a full dining experience - you go to the counter, order food, give your name and go pick up your own food. We left a nice tip but this hardly garnered a smile from staff. That said, the food was quite decent and we are familiar this cuisine. I recommend the arepas with beef (pabellon) and also the chicken arepa with avocado (reina pepiada) , the shredded beef empanada, the fried plantains (a must!) and the tequenos (another huge must). Even cold, the tequenos were good later. And this comes from me, a non-cheese lover. They were delicious - beautiful, firm white cheese - we got 4 of them to go and they were gone quickly. The food was authentic in taste and we would come back for another lunch. Prices were reasonable enough for the quality."}
{"text":"Wow! So good and so filling. There was a slight mix up with my order but I think that could just be chalked up to online delivery. I had the pabellon with a plain arepa on the side and it was amazing! I just wish I could have finished it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My first time being here the food was no flavor ... the arepas was so wet .. .. it was dead too . Never coming here again ."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal, such amazing food.  It's in the old part of Vegas on the north end of Las Vegas Blvd.  I would eat here again and again, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they were at the smaller location. I was afraid that the food would loose some of the quality when they added the chicken and so much more to the menu. I was wrong. Still amazing still delicious and great service. This place is my go too place when I'm short on time it's fast and great for your pocket what's not too like."}
{"text":"Was here last month during memorial day weekend. Food is extremely salty. I usually like to explore around and try out new country's cuisine. I dunno if Venezuelan food is supposed to be salty or this place just makes it horribly. I was having nasty cramps after eating here. Their empanadas were terrible. Empanadas are pretty much hard to mess up on because all you do is deep fry it. It's the worst empanadas I've ever had in my life.  Lot of times, yelp ratings are reliable and very useful but this is the first time where yelp has disappointed me.  It's in a dangerous neighborhood also. Thought I was in Walking Dead episode or something. Lot of homeless, drug addicts, etc loitering around this neighborhood.   Will never be back here again."}
{"text":"I did some wondering around after having some gelato from Art of Flavors and noticed Viva Las Arepas right next door. It was spacious but there weren't a lot of people inside. The menu seemed like there was a lot of going on, don't know when I'll be back again and had to get it right, so I had to rely on the Yelp app to see what everyone was getting.   The Reina Pepiada was mentioned pretty frequently.  I wasn't sure if it was something I should eat or someone I should meet. It was an arepas filled with a mixture of chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. It wasn't that big and didn't taste that amazing on it's own. It was too much avocado and mayo and not enough chicken for me but it was only about $5 and it was enjoyable after dumping whatever sauces were inside of the red and yellow containers.    They did lack customer service. I explained that this was my first time here and if they had any recommendations or customer favorites. They could not help me with that and seemed rude about it, even went back to whatever they were doing before I asked for a menu, sat in the corner, and brought out the Yelp app. I didn't feel as welcomed as Art of Flavors felt like I should go back there. Customer service is big for me, it's not that hard to be friendly, courteous, and give your attention to paying customers.  The rest of their food do sound and look good, from the reviews and pictures posted, and I'm sure they're well deserving of the 2 star I gave them but since the food from what I had was just OK and the service wasn't to my liking there is no way I can give them a 3 star, OK, to something I was not OK with. Another visit will happen but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service, big portions and amazibg flavor! We had yuca frita y carne, areoa con queso and my 10year old jad the ribs. Everything was flavorful, made to order and tasty!"}
{"text":"For the first time I stopped by today for lunch and the chef was more interested in talking on the phone than taking care of the customers, 10 minutes  went by and still he wouldn't get off the phone so I took my  business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite place to grab lunch downtown. I always get the vegetarian arepa, and sometimes the guava and cheese pastellito or fried yucca. Affordable and delicious. There's a bit of a lunch rush, but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"These Arepas are the best we ever had. The guy who took my wife's order was very rude and impatient, he demanded my wife tell him where she was picking up from? He kept barking at her saying Eat24!? Eat24?! Mind you we have ordered from yelp twice. And then my wife asked if she could have a dipping sauce for her fries. He yelled at her saying you didn't order fries, hand gesturing her to come here where he was standing by the resister only to find out that on the receipt we did order fries. He said you did order fries they'll be done in a min. Didn't even apologize for being a jerk. Food was fantastic but the service was a joke. Oh and there was hairs already in the styrofoam."}
{"text":"Found this place during my 4 day trip to Vegas. It is delicious, inexpensive, and not too far from the strip on the Stratosphere end. The arepas are a good size and very filling with many meat/flavor choices. The place is hot though, no a.c., it felt like."}
{"text":"Hi we're backkkkkkkkkk!!! We ordered the chicken arepas, corn crepe (SOOOOO GOOD! I ordered without the cheese tho) and plantains. Food was as good as I remembered it to be if not better."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The shredded beef arepa was delicious. The corn pocket thing is sooo good. Crisp yucca too. The creamy mayo sauce that comes with it all is scrumptious, wow. Wish I ordered two arepas. Went to a casino buffet the next day and just wished we had come back here instead, way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. Mesquite fired meats, authentic taste, clean place, awesome staff, and humble owner. The problem I have is how do you taste it all in one sitting?!  You can't. You come back. It's worth it. So good."}
{"text":"Really tasty street-side food. The arepas are made with light, fluffy dough that could be quite addictive. My tamarindo was great, too - not too sweet like some are.   One word of warning - the arepas are big, so only order 2 if you are famished."}
{"text":"You should try this place. It's good, just not I'm-here-every-other-day good. This is where you'd go to try something different and have a positive food experience.  Located eerily close to the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming, this stand has plenty of seating, but think about the weather because it's outside. Don't wear anything nice because the food drips.  We couldn't tell the difference taste wise between the shredded beef and the tongue arepas. Halfway through we regretfully realized the condiments provided were delicious. Don't be a fool; drench your arepa in them. A fatty may not be full from just one arepa.  We tried the agua de panela. I think it might be an acquired taste. Maybe I'll like it next time.  We came here on a sunny afternoon with no wind. Parking was a cinch and the line was small. I will return to try cold fillings and empanadas."}
{"text":"This is one of those food places I wish I had around me :) idk if I was really really hungry, or it was just that good! I'm leaning towards it was that good! I had the chicken and avacado arepa, it definitely didn't look like that much when it came out, but that arepa sure did fool my eyes! One arepa is very filling, then we realized we ordered to much food! The juices are good also! Try the passion fruit one, he will let you sample them before you buy :)"}
{"text":"This was disappointing! It was my first arepa and for $5.50 each (without adding avocado) all I got were tiny mesa pockets with some salty meat. The beef one was alright but the pork butt was too salty. I also asked for a chicken salad arepa which I have seen Yelpers post pictures of but instead they gave me a tiny side salad without any chicken on it. I also got 2 empanadas ($3 each) which were just okay but soggy by the time I got home. I ordered this all to go and was so eager to open up everything and chow down. But I was sorely disappointed once opening all the packages and seeing how little the food and overpriced everything was."}
{"text":"I knew the next time I went to visit Art of Flavors I would be eating dinner here first. So tonight was the night!! A date night with myself!   I wasn't really sure what Arepas were but I'm up for an adventure. I briefly read up a bit on what to expect and went with the flow when I got there. Trying to recover from the Smashburger hangover from the night before and still thinking about that Black Bean Burger, I got the Vegetarian Arepa and a side of Rice with Veggies.   So I found out that an Arepa is like a cornmeal English muffin crossed with taco like fillings. In my Vegetarian Arepa was Black Beans, Onions, Tomato and Avocado. So good! At $5 it was a pretty good \"sandwich\". Leave it in the wrapper it comes in it will help save you from losing all the insides. The Rice and Veggies were good and a decent size portion but for $2.99 for white rice and canned mixed veggies, I filled up enough with just my Arepa.   This was a counter service restaurant. You order at the counter, you pick up your food at the counter and your put your own trash in the trash can that is clear and obvious to put your trays and baskets on top.   I'll be back!! It was delish!!"}
{"text":"This is a must have for us every time we even get near Vegas!!!! Not fancy, not pretentious, just DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Great find in Las Vegas!  I've been wanting to try arepas ever since I saw some chef battle Bobby Flay on his show by cooking arepas and won! Who knew something so small could pack such powerful flavor!! I had their vegetarian arepa, and I was amazed! Their sauces complimented the arepas very well too! All my friends had very tasty looking arepas as well! They all said they were really glad we decided to stop by to try it!!   Gotta go find a place for arepas in the Bay Area now!!!"}
{"text":"THIS IS A VEGAS MUST!!!  If you're in the area, you just have to grab yourself an arepas from Viva because those things are no lie the best treats you can find!!  I've tried a few of their arepas and the ones that stand out to me the most are the woodfire chicken and the pork butt. Both loaded with flavor and the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth! You have a pay a little extra for cheese and avocado but I think it's still worth it overall!  I've been to both locations and they do not disappoint!"}
{"text":"First and last experience here. We've always wanted to try this place because we  heard great things. The food was so greasy that we couldn't finish what we ordered. Tonight we all feel ill. I would live to try arrows again, just not from here."}
{"text":"Arepas are all right. Customer service alright as well. Overall the place is pretty clean. But this place is really expensive!! If you don't mind paying so much per arepa than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place a couple times and considering the sketchy area I dont know why but it looked inviting and I had to try it , me and a friend went there and we got the beef and chicken empenadas which are perfect so light and tasty and the cilantro sauce is to die for , the arepas are equally as tasty , I had the pork butt one and it was delicious , i went back the 2nd time and the chicken salad one and it was good but not as good as the pork, I wish the chicken salad was roon temp . the fries were really good as well as the rice , the fresh juice is great and the people are VERY friendly and it just makes the place all more memorable to go back over and over !!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I'm sooooo glad they decided to open another location on my side of town! I only had a chance to go to the location off the strip every once in a while. The new location is slightly hidden, but don't let that deter you! I like the new design and it's really clean. Also, everything on the menu is affordable so that's a big plus!  My family and I almost always order the same thing: Wood fired beef Arepas, beef empanadas, and the tostones. The flavor of the meat is on point and there's nothing like wood-fired meat! They also give you some squirt bottles of avocado-cream sauce and green salsa that compliment all the food there quite well. We sometimes order the Reina Arepa which is a chicken salad arepa that is unique and delicious! My mouth is watering just thinking about this food. For those who don't know what an Arepa is, well it may be compared to a Mexican gordita but it's much bigger, more filling, and the shell is lighter in color and much denser. One is good enough to fill you up, but I always order another one and split it. I forgot to take pictures when I was there because I get so excited about the food and then I forget. I definitely will next time!  The manager there is awesome, friendly, and he has a great attitude. He always remembers us and greets us with respect. I can tell he's a really nice and genuine person...which is hard to come by nowadays. Thank you Ivan, for your amazing attitude and service! We always enjoy seeing you when we stop by! You"}
{"text":"I love Arepas and while planning a trip to Vegas I found this food cart on Yelp. What a find it was. I had the #7 chicken and avocado Aprepa it was excellent! Trying to figure how I can go another time or two while I'm here."}
{"text":"The arepas were good and the fillings were ok. We ordered pabellón arepas (a twist on the Venezuelan traditional dish of Pabellón Criollo), arepas de pernil (pork) and cheese arepas. I was disappointed with the fillings. Let's start with the temperature. They were Kramer lawsuit hot. Hot food is good but so hot that it burns your mouth, not so good. But temperature can be solved with blowing and patience. The flavor was lacking. I am used to eating well seasoned meat and beans in Venezuelan dishes, and these were not. In addition the fried plantains were not very ripe which made them dry and starchy in the middle. I was hoping that I would like Viva Las Arepas more. ¡Que lástima!"}
{"text":"rib soup is amazing! mix grill is huge portion, enough for 3 I also love the fried yucca and plantain."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service!!!   Had the Carne Asada Arepa, My wife had the Shredded Beef and my daughter has the shredded chicken all we're phenomenal. I'm definitely coming back next time i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio, muy buen sabor , cantidad correcta según el precio, pedí una arepa de pollo y se equivocaron y me sirvieron una de frijoles , cuando le explico al muchacho muy amable me dijo que me quedara con la frijoles y me dio la de pollo sin costo alguno , altamente recomendable"}
{"text":"I love this little establishment because the food tastes great and unique as there is no other authentic Venezuelan restaurants in Vegas.  The price is very reasonable and you wont find any place like it.  Their juices are great as well.  It gives you a feeling you are in the tropics!"}
{"text":"Don't let your inexperience with Venezuelan food stop you.  If you like good fire grilled meat you will like this place.  I took 5 high school seniors out to eat here so they could experience some of the food that they will be eating as they about to serve their LDS missions to South America,  At best their knowledge of foreign food was eating Roberto's and Panda Express.  We had a little of everything.  They loved it all and so will you.  The empanadas are about the best I ever had.  Perfect crust around enough filling.  Arepas are my new favorite sandwich pick the meat you like and go for it. Start with whatever they suggest as the favorites. You have to use both the spicy dark green and the light green sauces. Try the Tequeño Pastelitos (fried pastry covered cheese sticks) awesome.  Yucca fries are uniquely good but if you are not adventurous the regular french fries are great.  For something traditional, I like the sweet fried plantains but the boys like the \"tostones\" which are the stage 1 (green) plantains that are fried up and smashed like a thick potato chip.  The juices are a little expensive for my taste but I am a huge fans of fresh passion fruit juice."}
{"text":"Man this place is really good. Sort of unassuming from the outside and you think yeah it's probably just alright but the arepas and salsa are absolutely fantastic. The aquas frescas are also super fresh tasting and good. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Arepas.. arepas! Such a delicious Venezuelan dish and this place is authentic as it can get right in the heart of Vegas! Located past the strip and towards downtown, it is easy to find! Parking is a little challenge since it's located in a small complex. If you cannot find parking, there are spots to park around the area and you'd have to take a quick walk to get across the street. Hey, at least it's free parking!  Once you enter, you are welcomed by the smell of the meats cooking on the grill! If you  had never had an arepa, it is basically an open-faced pupusa or a falafel. You have two pieces of dough, usually made out of maize, and fillings of meats and sauces sandwiched in the middle! It is a very popular South American dish typically in Venezuela and Colombia.   My orders:  Yucca Root- Delicious and so simple! You get a lot of Yucca root cut up like thick fries (a lot healthier) and they fry it. There wasn't a lot of oil and no condiments because the  root itself has its unique flavor! This is a great side dish to order while you eat your arepas.  Fried Plantains- I love anything with bananas/plantains! This sweet dish really compliments the savory and saltiness of the yucca root and the arepas. It is a great combination to have with your meal!   Fire-grilled beef arepa- I thought the arepas were going to be small, but it turned out to be quite fulfilling! The beef is perfectly grilled with vegetables and special sauces.  Fire-grilled chicken arepa- The chicken has to be my favorite. I love the taste of grilled chicken with the arepa! I would definitely get it again!   Passion fruit juice- They have an array of drinks and juices that are local favorites if you were to be in South America! I tried the passion fruit and it was so refreshing! Not too sweet and not too watery either!  Overall, my experience here was great. Customer service was great, the food was great and so was the ambience! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have never had an Arepa, and now it's one of my favorite meals! So delicious the food was as great as the service. I'd recommend it to everyone planning on a Vegas trip and will go back for my next trip!"}
{"text":"I went to Las Vegas a month ago. And went to Viva Las Arepas. It was delicious. Thank you for your hard work. Estaba muy rico!"}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic food experience! These Arepas were heavenly. One would have been plenty but we had two. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly, the pork was flavorful great combination with the cornmeal Aprepas. The beef was grilled, very tender. The chicken tasted smokey, a good balance with the avocado dressing.  The sugar cane drinks are to die for. Definitely a place to visit when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pork butt Arepas was delicious!! Plus the sauce in the bottles that they provided goes very good with it. Been to Vegas many time, but never knew about this place. It I nice to come to Vegas and be able to find great tasting food off the strip.   Place is clean and staffs are friendly. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite just north of the Stratosphere. I tried a few different empenadas and will be back to try other menu items. The sugar cane and lime drink also tasted nice."}
{"text":"Honest to goodness Venezuelan food.  The Reina Pepeada arepa is good (venezuelan style chicken salad with avocado suffed into an arepa).  The rotisserie chicken done Venezuelan style is also very good.  My only gripe: no beer here."}
{"text":"A nice small casual place north of the Las Vegas strip. It is located on a weird corner street and parking is limited. The menu is in both English and Spanish and price are reasonably affordable as compared to restaurants on the strip. The air circulation could improved. It was a bit muggy inside but satisfying enough to be away for the Las Vegas heat.  There was a good variety of food available so narrowing can be tough. I've ordered the chicken arepa while my brother ordered the beef arepa. I recommend the beef over the chicken. Personally, I believe there's more flavor between the two. The outside of the arepa is a bit oily so be careful not to remove the wrapping. I made the mistake of removing it and it broke into pieces.  By the way, they charge 50 cents for a cup of water as indicated on the sign. What kind of place does this for tap water? This is a disaster recipe for BYOH2O."}
{"text":"Pork Butt Arepas = 5 Stars...the rest of food is a solid 4 stars.  There is something wonderful about arepas after a couple of beers...in fact in those moments Viva Las Arepas might garner 5 stars from me!  Most of the items here are good...such as the empanadas, meat w/ 2 sides, etc.  Still, like the name says, I come here for arepas.  The arepas are not just good for Vegas arepas, they are downright good arepas period.  I still miss their old stand there was something beautiful about getting divey at Dino's, grabbing an aprepa, and then finishing things off at Luv-It custard.  And while you can still walk all three of those, the ambiance has certainly changed still Viva Las Arepas opened and actual restaurant.  The interior of the space is now somewhere between a Roberto's and a Baja Fresh...there is plenty of seating, but it's not a place I want to hang out at.  Get a couple of arepas, or better yet share several items with a friend or two...the prices are nice here, so order a little more!"}
{"text":"Out of control!!!  I had the Reina Pepiada and Yuka Fries.  SO SO GOOD!  Also, the guy at the counter was a babe - BONUS!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!!! Never have I had this type of food before. It was absolutely delicious!! We had Reina Pepiada Arepa. So so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband is Venezuelan so we stop by whenever he needs a taste of home. The cachapas are my favorite,but the reina pepiada (chicken, peas, and avocado) and black bean with cheese are also a must. The fried yucca is also delicious. My husband insists on washing everything down with Frescolita, but I like the sugar cane with lime bit is kind of like a limeade. The restaurant is always spotless and the prices can't be beat. A total must stop."}
{"text":"The best Tropical flavored Fast Food place in Vegas hands down!  Great service, Delicious Arepas and Cachacas remind me of my time in Venezuela.  We need more locations!!"}
{"text":"Went here looking for gluten free in Vegas.  Got the beef arepa and yucca fries.  Beef was bland, a bit gristly and dry.  Yucca fries interesting but nothing special.  That and a coconut water (has sugar - be warned) put me out 14 bucks.  It appears that this place was good when it operated from a food truck, but apparently what you get now is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We needed to stop in Because we hadn't before but we just ate so we had 1 chicken avo arepa, it was great- I will see be back for more. The white cilantro sauce I could put on everything I eat for the rest of my life. The green salsa was good but next time I'll ask for something extra spicy. I'll update this when I have a chance to try 5-6 things and leave a better review."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is a little slice of home for my gf from Caracas. We walked up and she started screaming for all the foods she misses from back home. The arepas and the empanadas and the drinks and the sauces and everything is amazing and perfect and you shouldn't miss this place if you're in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. It makes me want to travel to Argentina just to eat more. The staff is great as well."}
{"text":"i remember when this place was just a little stand in a parking lot. They have come a long way and it just goes to show how great their food and customer service is. I still remember going there for the firs time, ordering and getting an ice cold passion fruit drink in 120 degree vegas heat. I inhaled my passion fruit drink because I was sweating like a pig, and the owner offered me a free refill while i was waiting for my food. I still remember that moment and any chance I get when a friend comes to town or i meet someone and they have not had an arepa before, i take them to viva las arepas for some local las vegas love. BTW, the Arepas are amazing."}
{"text":"$3.50-$5.00 for arepas, $2.00 for empanadas. The garlic shrimp was underwhelming. I was happy with the shredded beef, but the hot sauce makes it delicious! Gotta have a crispy empanada while you are at it. Be careful, the food is dense and the bread will make you full fast!"}
{"text":"Especially clean place. Price is fair. Service was above average. Conveniently located a short walk away from the stratosphere hotel. The food is incredibly unique, yet the portions are very small. My father and I had each an arepas, as he said, \"a burrito in a corn pancake\"."}
{"text":"Venezuelan food is pretty foreign to me. My first time eating here. The place is very clean, the staff is super friendly and the food tastes really good.  I save my five star ratings to the mind blowing experiences thus the four stars. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my first arepas experience and I'm sad to say it wasn't a tasty one. Perhaps it's good compared to other arepas? But if this is the best of it, I probably won't want to order arepas again.   Service was great. You walk up to the counter to order, pay, get seated and someone will bring your food out. After you're done eating, clean up after yourself by throwing everything but the plastic baskets in the trashcan.   FRIED YUCCA ROOTS ($3)- interesting and fairly good. Tastes similar to potato fries except it's cut bigger and looks like sugar cane pieces.    REINA PEPIADA ($6) - chicken breast + avocado, mayo and cilantro arepa... filled me up but lacked the flavor and jazz I was looking for after reading reviews about it.   PORK BUTT w/ tomato slices ($5) - my bf said it tasted kind of like a sloppy joe haha. I suppose it's because of how the pork was shredded and the brown sauce it was drenched in.   We were given 3 bottles of sauces: cilantro and mayo sauce, green hot sauce, and ketchup. My bf liked the cilantro sauce  The passionfruit drink was good though.  It's located north of the strip with it's own parking lot. The restaurant itself is a hole-in-the-wall. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I always stop here whenever im in Vegas, its a MUST. However, ever since they moved into their restaurant across from their old location, I feel as if the quality in the food has gone down somewhat."}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing!!! Anytime I find myself in this side of town I have to stop by, my favorite is the carne asada arepa, with a side of plaintains! Introduced my family to it and even though they are picky eaters they still found something they liked! Service is exceptional also, I can always count on them to suggest something Yummy!! I can't say enough if you haven't been yet you need to go!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try some food I never had before. Venezuelan. Searched this place on yelp before going and saw some very good reviews and high quality photos from other users. The reina pepiada seemed to be a very popular and the menu had other chef recommendations. There is an outside patio which is really refreshing for those who enjoy the outdoor seating. Inside there are lots of pictures and the dining area has plenty of space. Was not so packed during the time of entry but then customers started coming right after. Cashier was very nice and took the order immediately. Food did not take very long to come out and appeared to be fresh. We ordered pineapple juice(good), #1 carne Asada arepa, #7, reina pepiada, #12 pabellon arepa and a plantein appetizer with cream. Honestly it was all delicious! 8.5 stars for tasting and 9 for the overall experience. Would come back to try different options if I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The best plantains I've ever had. Ordered the plantains, French fries, beef empanada, pork and the smoked chicken arepas. Super good."}
{"text":"The chicken and pork arepas weren't that bad. It was fresh. I didn't really care for the arepas but the beef empanada was super super bomb! The plantains were bomb! I loved loved the plantains. We also go French fries they were super good. We dipped everything in the green sauce. I don't how they make it but he green sauce is bomb!"}
{"text":"Downtown Vegas at its best!!!! Two full courses $23. A great find in Vegas far from the strip and absolutely great food. We love Downtown Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!!!  On the other side of the strip with not great parking.  However, they are open late.    The pictures around the dining room look EXACTLY like what you get served!!  Service was great!  The food was soooo good.  Beware... this is not a diet place!!!!!  Rich fried areas (like papusas) with all sorts of great fillings.  The chicharones and yucca were really yummy.  The plantains were INCREDIBLE!!!  I really enjoyed the flour \"bread\" with the beans and cheese.  I liked the sweet corn with mozzarella also.  It was my favorite.  The fries are good but I don't think they are hand cut.  The sauces were yummy as well.  I had never heard of areas before I came to this restaurant and I will definitely look for more in California.  Great late night fare!!!"}
{"text":"Arepas are one of the things that we really enjoy and this is I nice little place for that. Good food for good price."}
{"text":"First time trying out arepas! And this was a good place to start. Five stars for the Reina Pepiada. Chicken isn't usually my first meat of choice, but I saw the good reviews on the Reina Pepiada so I had to try them out. Aand it was great! The plantain may be a bit too oily for others, but I liked it."}
{"text":"I really love this place and the staff is so nice, HOWEVER, I had to be reminded why I stopped coming here, by having an MSG reaction again. It may be something hidden in a product they use that they're unaware of. Maybe they'll consider looking into their ingredients, using GMO free corn and doing away with the Styrofoam. Then I'll check it out again. Both times I had the Reina Pepiada. If you're sensitive to MSG, or just want to preserve the integrity of your brain, you might consider choosing a different one. :-( I would have also preferred to contact them directly, versus leaving a negative review, but their website doesn't have contact information."}
{"text":"If I were to die tomorrow and come back as a food it would be an Arepa. My only regret in life being that it took me so long to discover this AMAZING food. I first had this back in September, and have eaten it at least once every other week since then.  I have been a hardcore Tamale fan for years, and I Love anything that involves corn. Corn bread, corn masa, corn souffle, etc. So when I found out Arepas are these delicious little pita pockets made from corn I fell in love before I ever even tasted it. When I arrived at the Dino's parking lot I knew I was in for something special when I saw all of the picnic tables sitting around outside, and at least 10 people standing and sitting around eating and eagerly awaiting their orders....Oh yea, and this was at 11pm!  Looking at the menu, as usual, I couldn't decide which of the many amazing options to try, so, also as usual I over ordered.  I got 3 Arepas 2 empanadas, and 2 tequenos. Total cost: $16....(Although, they have raised the prices slightly since I first went and this order would now be roughly $20.) But trust me this is enough food for 2. I had no idea how much meat they were going to cram into that little corn pocket. I got the Roasted Pork butt, the Shredded Beef, and the Garlic shrimp arepas, and although I realized I had over-ordered after one empanada and half the first arepa, I still managed to polish off every bit of that order except the tequenos, which were the only thing I wasn't extremely impressed with. (They are basically like bland crescent rolls stuffed with white cheese.) But, whatever that greenish white mayo-type sauce may be, it is the most perfect condiments i've ever had and goes perfectly with the saltiness of the meal.   I haven't tried any of the more interesting ones: Tripe, lengua, etc. But i you are an obsessive tamale fan like I am just go and try the roasted pork butt, and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Arepas are so awesome. I lived with a Columbian family for 6 months, and the sweet little abuela would make arepas sometimes for breakfast. This place nails them perfectly. Abuela would be proud.  It's cheap and veggie friendly. I woke up the next morning and googled a recipe. I cannot get those tasty crispy cakes out of my head.  I ate two and was stuffed. It's perfect bar food."}
{"text":"If u want a good but different food try this place. Very friendly people. Clean. Very fulfilling."}
{"text":"OMG! Always wanted to come here and finally have. Best decision ever. Great Arepas. We had a #1 Wood fire beef. A #7 Reina Pepiada & a #12 Pabellón. They are all delicious in there own way. Their cilantro sauce and green hot sauce accompanies them all equally. Their mango water is also good not to mention the service is impeccable. Great atmosphere and very clean. Definitely recommend when in town."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie. Came to this place because it was highly rated and so well reviewed. I've never had an arepa before so was bewildered upon looking at their menu. The staff was friendly and more than happy to make recommendations of their most popular dishes. Between me and my wife we had 3 arepas which was the perfect portion size. We had the Reina Pepiada, Pabellon and Roasted Pork Butt. The Pepiada was refreshing with its cilantro/mayo sauce. The Pabellon had a sweet/savory taste to it thanks to the plantains. The Roasted Pork Butt was full of smokey and delicious butt flavor.   We were definitely satisfied at the end of our meal and wish we had room to try more. Will have to stop by again the next time we visit Vegas to try the others."}
{"text":"Omg absolutely delicious! I live down the street and I cannot believe it's taken me so long to eat here! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place last night.  I admit it was a little freaky sitting on tables on the sidewalk with cars driving by, but the food helped ease my fear of being hit by a car.  This is one time that I wish I had gone with my gut and not ordered what the yelpers recommended.  I ordered the Reina Pepiada (an arepa with chicken, avocado, mayo, peas) and the pork butt arepa.  Pork butt was fantastic, totally would get this again.  Not fatty, totally tender.  The Reina Pepiada though, I'm not so sure about.  I'm not too crazy about staying in shape, but I feel like anyone who is concerned about their health wouldn't be eating this for dinner every day.  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I will order it from this point on.  Way too much mayo for my taste.  Overall great experience, come here for a quick bite.  If you have a date that doesn''t mind being in a non-romantic setting or be accosted by strange people on the street, this would be a perfect date spot!"}
{"text":"Riquisimo! Te lo recomiendo Los pastelitos, la yuquita frita.   Very good food. Everything I delicious! You have to try arepa Pelua!"}
{"text":"Really good arepas of all sorts. Got the woodfire beef, chicken, breakfast, and pork. Pork was my favorite only reason gave it 4. All over a good place."}
{"text":"The food is good and the restaurant is clean. The people are friendly. If you get a chance visit the place! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"OH MY. This place is amazing. Could not be a bigger fan. I would recommend the arepas that I had, but both of the arepas I had were majestic, as were the arepas that my friends got. This place is getting added to the Tacos el Gordo rotation.  Side note: I ordered through UberEats and it came in less than twenty minutes, well wrapped and piping hot!"}
{"text":"This place was on my bookmarks since it was the shack down the street. What the heck took me so long? A well deserved 5 star review worth every spec of red you see on the YELP website!  They have a variety of Venezuelan style dishes. Of course the most popular being the Arepas. You can get chicken, beef, vegetarian, cheese, corn, basically there will be SOMETHING you will like. They also serve fried plantains, delicious black beans, empanadas (literally the BEST empanada I have ever had), and chicken cooked on the grill fresh to order. A half a chicken and 2 sides is only $9!  Our table tried a little bit of everything and all of us were extremely happy. Every single thing was fresh and above par. The only thing I didn't get this visit was one of the rare juices. I think I will try the fresh sugar cane with lime next time.  The service was better than average. The lady behind the counter helped me with all the food that I had no clue how to pronounce and also answered my questions in detail. The chef was walking around the entire time making sure things were clean, and patrons were happy.  This place deserves to be on the top 20 MUST TRY in Vegas spots! Without question!"}
{"text":"Came by because of the high reviews and was thoroughly disappointed. Worst part was finding a hair baked into the shell of the arepa - GROSS!!! They were nice about replacing the item but we were pretty grossed out with the sanitation and meal.   Wood fire beef ($5.50): not much flavor to this and pretty dry  Pork butt ($4.50): meat was soft but pretty salty.  Reina pepieda ($5.50): the avocado helped give the arepa more flavor. Thought it would be weird because it was cold but this was my favorite of the three arepas.  Shredded Chicken empanada ($2.75): chicken was very good. Better meat than the meat in the arepas. These empanadas are fried. This was the best item we had.  Strawberry cherry drink ($2.75): tastes almost like fruit punch but refreshing break from all of the dry food.   Not sure if we missed the hot items but we were not impressed with the food and totally turned off by the hair in the food. It's a ways off of the strip and I wouldn't bother making the trek out here."}
{"text":"Arepas were yum yummy.. Loved emapandas..  Only thing dint like much was sugarcane with lime, too sour.."}
{"text":"My family and I  love the food, service is awesome I can't get enough of this place especially their passion fruit drink!!!! I strongly reccomend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Excellent every time! And I come here for my lunch break at least every other day.  The arepas are amazing, but my usual is the chicken thigh combo. 3 huge pieces of mesquite wood grilled chicken with a side of rice for $7 bucks and some change, definitely can't beat that. Also they're salsa will make anything taste good!"}
{"text":"Tried Venezuelan cuisine for the first time in my life at this restaurant. I must say I wasn't disappointed. The food was good and filling for the amount. They don't have that much variety in menu. However I still liked the dishes we tried."}
{"text":"I'm from Venezuela and I can said that the food is good but the owner need to work in how him give attention to the client he is not so kind and that can make your business go down"}
{"text":"I came upon this place by accident- actually by fate I believe!!!   I tried abcarne mechada empanada that was absolutely delicious. It was piping hot and made to perfection! My sister is obsessed with fries so we ordered them. They are thin but fresh and we put the mayo garlic cilantro sauce (in the white bottle) all over them. So bomb.   My sister got the carne arepa but we both didn't care for it... It tasted more like pork. We will be trying the pollo next time.   YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE! I'm obsessed.   It is a bit pricey though so bring some extra cash :)"}
{"text":"First stop in Las Vegas and it was delicious.  Ordered the Carne asada, pork butt, and shredded chicken.  All of them came out hot and were very good.  Shredded chicken had a bit of a bbq flavor to it."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's clean, the employees are very nice and the food is yummy!! I had the vegetarian arepa and it was excellent. We will be back for more arepas and to try other wonderful dishes. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a late review but its better late than never.  My friend and I was so excited hearing about this restaurant that we had to try out the Chef's choice Arepas of the shredded beef and chicken.  We also then tried their dessert pastries of the guava and cheese. Then the fresh squeezed mango juice while he had a soda to wash away the goodness.  They were very clean and organized when we came in after the lunch hour.    The filling was way more than we thought packed into a small pocket of corn cake patties. We were actually full after eating and had to wait a while to eat our dessert pastries.  I wish there were seconds on the drinks! The fresh juices were soo good! All in all, a great food experience and such a great price.  And if you are coming from late night sight seeing or bar hopping its open until 12am!  Its a must go eat and right off of the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"Wow. Thank you Yelp reviews! I can't remember the last time I was this satisfied by cilantro and avocado. The Reina. Yes. Do it. The staff. Yes. Adorable. Welcoming. Great kitchen staff. Food was fast especially when I was just waking up on my day off, thy welcomed my pup on the patio and gave lots of extra sauces without me having to beg or pay. Next on the agenda, the pork butt. Do it. Enjoy yourself. Totally affordable, 4-6 bucks an arepa (fills you up), cheap cans of pop, horchata, $2.50 apps and huge sides. Great location near those of us locals in the art district and great for those drunk tourists on the north end of the strip. Park behind the building on casino center if you don't want to loop around the one ways. Really. Do it."}
{"text":"They are sooo nice there! We came in at 5 minutes to close and I DID NOT want to even be \"that girl\" and make the whole damn restaurant stay until we ate. They were more than adamant that it was A-OK and they got us the yummiest food quick. Melty in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Yummy, *VEGAN* options! Vegetarian arepa without cheese/crema/dairy & a side (or two) of fried tostones! Can barely keep my hands off the tostones until they are cool enough to eat.  Unique, fresh flavors for me, totally unique & worth trying. Don't write it off as \"beans again\", or compare it to other Latin cuisines. Even the salsa is different & yummy. Even the peppers/chiles used inside the arepa - not sure if they use ajis dulces chiles, but they are not your run-of-the-mill serrano/jalapeño/habanero/etc. Mmm!  Affordable, relatively quick, veg friendly, just can't beat it.  P.S. Tostone Lovers: I really love the tostones across the street at Florida Cafe, esp. with the yummy mojo de ajo (different style of cuisine, I know), but shhhh...these are fresher, faster, and better."}
{"text":"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  Reina Pepiada - LOVED this.  This is my usual because there is something satisfying about a cold and flavorful filling with a warm corn flatbread straight from the griddle.  Imagine a chicken salad but creamy and rich with avocado and well-seasoned chicken.  Shredded Beef - Yum! The beef was flavorful and extremely tender.  Not one tough strand of beef =D  Cachapa - Enjoyed this, however I wish they used a different cheese other than mozzarella.  The sweetness of the corn is SO ADDICTING!  OVERALL:  Great spot down the strip if you aren't looking to spend $$$$ for a great and super filling meal.  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"}
{"text":"For any gluten free friends who are stuck eating flavorless cardboard bread alternatives, this place is amazing!! Great quality meats sandwiched inti yummy corn arepas with just enough light sauce where needed. Chicken, beef & garlic shrimp with plantains for dessert!! Yum yum yum. I am told I am a pain picking restaurants but will be back for sure!! Thanks Yelp for the suggestion to a Vegas local since 97"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp (thanks, guys!!!), what a gem!  This place is a great option if you want to avoid the \"typical Vegas\" experience. Heck, this place is a great option if you're looking for real, good food. The servings are huge - the arepas are a little bigger than the size of your fist (I guess that depends on how big your fist is). The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is super robust! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I ordered the garlic shrimp and the vegetarian arepas. My boyfriend, who's half Venezuelan (and he's even been to Venezuela) said that he thinks the vegetarian one is the best one he's ever had. He even wanted it as his last bite after he finished his chicken arepa. We also ordered a side of plantains and some passion fruit juice - both of which were sweet and scarfed down. A patron also told us that the fries are delicious - fresh cut like In N Out's, but better.  Felix was a pleasure to talk to and order from. The pricing is extremely reasonable ($4-$6/arepa), and we only needed 2 each to fill up before our drive back to LA. We waited a little bit for the food to be ready (clearly, I need instant gratification), but it was definitely for a good reason. The parking lot is small and shared with other stores, but we were able to find a spot for lunch; despite the small parking lot, the restaurant is spacious with plenty of seating. I hope I pass through Vegas soon, so I could get some more!"}
{"text":"This was great, I love Arepas but they are difficult to find in Louisiana and I haven't mastered making them myself.  I will visit this dive every time I come to vegas now."}
{"text":"My first time ever trying these Venezuelan treats! Holy wow, cross between a papusa and a taco. (Two of my favorite things in one) ingredients were fresh and It was  one of the best tasting things I have had in a long time. It's fresh fast food. The staff were friendly and our food arrived quickly. I will bring my out of town friends there from now on when they visit. Really happy to have ventured downtown today, and found this gem."}
{"text":"Came back here before heading back home. Sure glad I did! We ordered the Reina Pepiada, Cachapa, Guava and cheese pastelitos and their flan.  Reina Pepiada was so good! Best one I had there. Cachapa is pretty big. We didn't think it was that big but it filled out the whole plate.  It was good. The Guava and Cheese Pastelitos was ok. Nothing special. Their flan was good. Similar to Mexican flan.   Definitely check this place out if you're in Vegas! Make sure to add the green sauces to every bite! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place! I know of it's rave Yelp reviews and was excited to try it when I saw it offering a certificate on restaurant.com. I put the address without the suite # and was routed to the wrong place by Maps, but the Yelp app saved the day. It's next to a gelato shop & some trashy club wear place. Very sketchy with a couple homeless people, including a man in a wheelchair offering my husband $1 for 2 cigaettes. Unfortunately, my husband had to tell him it was a vape and not a cigarette.   The restaurant itself was very clean and happy with its yellow walls. The employees were all very helpful. We ordered quite a bit of items and there were no problems accepting our certificate. We sat and the owner brought our order out to us directly.   We had: Wood fire beef with cheese: 5 stars. This was our favorite! Very flavorful beef with stringy cheese, tomato, and lettuce.   Pulled pork with cheese: 4 stars. Juicy pulled pork that tasted smokey and tender. My issue with the arepas that I received was that not all the shell things were toasted equally. Some were crispy and would hold up and be buttery deliciousness. Others were more soft, but ended up becoming soggy and tasting like a mushy corn texture.   Reina pepiada: 4 stars. It is an avocado chicken salad. It was yummy although missing some texture.  Garlic shrimp: 2 stars. This was my least favorite by far. The arepa for this one seemed very corn mealy? It wasn't toasted very much and got soggy quick. The shrimp are tiny little guys that you'd probably find at red lobster in their pasta. Also, pretty bland.   Grilled chicken empanada: 2 stars. I've had empanadas made by my friends from Argentina, and it's all about the shell thing. This one was super thick! It was like eating an arepa with only a little bit of filling. Just way too carby for me. The grilled chicken in it was yummy though! I'd like to try it in an arepa next time.   Fried plantains: 3 stars. Not my cup of tea. Kind of slimy in texture. If they were fried in oil, I couldn't tell because there was no crisp, but because they are called fried plantains, I will assume they were doused in oil, which make it not worth the calories.   Guava & cheese thing: 4 stars. Way better shell than the empanada and yummy guava with cheese. I wish the cheese was more melted but when I bit into it, it still looked like a solid block.   Overall, I would stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood. Perhaps I'd ask for the arepa extra toasted just to make sure there aren't any soggy ones. I definitely want to try to the grilled chicken. I appreciate this small business and the love the put into their food. I fortunately, there were just some issues I couldn't overlook. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Party in my mouth is all I can say. This place was delicious. I had the reina papiada and it was the best choice I ever made. The delicious picante really made the flat bread. I'm in love and will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice find on the North end of the Strip.  One of those Yelp bookmarks that hangs around like a dangling chad at an election in Florida.  Finally, it was Dad's day to pick where HE wanted to eat on Sunday. So off to Viva Las Arepa's we went  I chose a variety of Empanada's and Arepa's for every one to share. My family had never really experienced this type of food before but I was convinced this meal would satisfy there finicky eating habits.    I selected the Pork Butt Arepa's which had a smokey mesquite flavor and was slathered in a spicy sauce.  The flavors got even better when I drenched the corn cake sandwich in the house made cilantro sauce and the spicy verde hot sauce.  The sauces alone I could drink by the gallon.  The cilantro creamy sauce was so refreshing and had great flavor.  We also had a cheese Arepa and a black bean and cheese Arepa as well both were excellent.  The black beans were seasoned so perfectly and had just the right amount of salt to keep you savoring for more.      Next on the sampling list was the Empanada's we tried three types the black bean, the cheese and the Veg.  Once again we were not disappointed with the taste and quality of these items selected(at least the parents).  These cheese flavor had a yellow cheddar cheese which went perfectly with the fried corn turnover.    Overall this place is a must try in Vegas.  This restaurant takes great pride in their food quality and it shows.  They are a gluten free and Non-GMO restaurant which is a win, win for everyone.  Viva Las Arepa's even smokes all their meat in the back of the restaurant which gives the space a delicious smokey scent which makes you want to lick the walls it smells so good.  The staff have always been friendly here and are quick to greet you with a smile.  Another plus for me on this visit is that the chef noticed that my kids were out of french fries and gladly dropped a new batch to help keep my sanity on Father's Day.  Great Visit and we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"OK, so I don't usually get off my tired behind to write one of these reviews.  So the folks at Viva Las Arepas have to KNOW that they MADE MY DAY.  Here I am thinking that I was in Vegas and due to my limited financial situation, I would have to suffer the indignities of some sub-par dining experience.  But after a quick \"Gluten Free\" search on YELP - Yeah, I am actually Gluten intolerant, a curse of course - I saw the lovely link to VLA.  These folks are actually open till Midnight!  Oh, and the Arepas were so good I went back - with my craving family the next day for lunch.    What I can recommend:  Pork Butt Arepa, Reina Arepa, Garlic Shrimp Arepa, The MOST TENDER RIBS I have has since I made mine last week, Chicharonnes and Yucca - if you love pork, you gotta try this and finally the Cachapas - it is like combining some amazing farm cheeses, romano and my mom's cornbread recipe into  the most amazing CHEESY-CORN experience.    Great location - under the shadow of the Stratosphere, as you leave the New and begin your journey back into the OLD LV you can get some amazing grub for the ride.  The owner is the nicest guy as well, welcoming and sharing with his knowledge of the food and the story of the place - you must ask him where they began.    Oh and finally don't forget to get the Soursop juice.  Although its a little too sweet for most, it is a taste that lingers between a mix of mango, coconut and milk.  Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Located on the end of a small strip mall about two blocks north of the Stratosphere, this time lace is a gem.  Small outdoor patio and indoor dining.  Nothing fancy, just solid, fresh food.  Tried the Reina Pepiada (a chilled chicken salad - chicken breast,mayo, avocado, cilantro) - excellent.  An Arepa is a small flattened disc of white corn flour that is grilled at then split and filled with a variety of fillings.  They also sell whole and half chickens grilled over mesquite wood.  Everything is fresh.  The empanadas are delicious as well.  Average price for an Arepa is $4 - $6.  Empanadas are $3.  The place is kept clean.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, the best grilled chicken in town.  There's really nothing else to write."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!!  First time here and ordered online and picked up 2 empanadas and fried plantains!  Wonderful.... will be back soon"}
{"text":"This is the good stuff!  Usually with arepas you can get either good meat filling OR good corn pancake but usually not both.  This place has it all. If you agree that most hole-in-the-wall places focus on the food and not the glitz and glamour of their interior to falsely allure you then you are in the right spot.  Try the pork butt or chicken and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME.   When you walk in you can smell the burning wood and the place is clean and spacious with lots of seating.   The man at the counter was very helpful, he let us know the popular items, let us know that the arepa looked tiny but they are very filling. Each arepa on the menu is around 5-7 bucks depending on what's inside it. You can add extra toppings like cheese, fried egg, and avocado for .50 - $1.00.   We ordered one shredded chicken one beef with plantains and beans. Came out to around $12. Sure enough when we picked them up they were really hefty. Check out the photos! The arepa itself was nice and crunchy on the outside but was really soft and kind of crumbly on the inside. Overall had a great mouthful and paired perfectly with the well seasoned meat. It almost reminded me of a gigantic tamale but 10,000 times better. They also serve them with a side of green hot sauce and garlic cilantro mayo, both of which I recommend.  They also give you a bunch of napkins, and you're going to need all of them because things get REALLY messy really quickly. Next time I might use a fork and knife just to help me tackle all of the meat.   Thankful we were able to try this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Venezuelan street food. I'm happy I have it a try. This joint is located right next to Stratosphere so it's easy to find. And great that they opened an actual restaurant versus just operating out of a food truck. The gentleman behind the counter were all smiles and willing to recommend an arepa for first-timers.   I had the pork butt arepa with cheese, chicken empanadas and fried plantains and passion fruit juice. This came to approximately $15. Not bad for the meal.  I didn't expect the arepa to be so heavy. Imagine an English-muffin like sandwich stuffed to the brim with your meat of choice and cheese. The bread is made of corn flour.  It wasn't bad, but adding their homemade sauces gives it full flavor. The empanada dough was thicker than I'd like but the meat again had a lot of flavor. The plantains were simple. Fried bananas. But it's blandness helped cut the richness of the arepa and empanada.  I admit I couldn't finish the whole thing and I felt as if a boulder was in my stomach when leaving. But Viva Las Arepas was an experience and I urge you to try it. Authenticity is served here."}
{"text":"I was craving arepas and I couldn't find my favorite arepa food truck anywhere, so I decided to come here and get my fix. I order a chicken arepa. I wanted to like it but I was not satisfied. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've had. I think the best thing I had that night was the passiontfruit juice. I will go back and try other items off their menu."}
{"text":"It didn't wow me but it was good.  Maybe I'm not into the way they prepare the meet.  The arepas corn patties/pockets are delicious.  It's kind of like a sope to me.  Favorite: Roasted Pork Butt Arepas Beef Shredded Empenada  Okay: Wood Fire Beef (Asada) Arepas Reina Pepiada Arepas  Bad: Fries were old and dark brown.  Quality control was lacking.  It's really close to Stratosphere."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I have eaten lunch here 3 times in the past two weeks... Trying something new everytime! I have seen several great reviews on this place, so I had to stop and check it out. A little stand in Dino's parking lot that cranks out food with lots of flavor.   The first visit I tried the most popular item - Shredded Beef Arepa! 2 cornmeal cakes stuffed with shredded beef in the middle that was seasoned perfectly. They then give you a creamy cilantro sauce or hot sauce to put on...  The creamy cilantro is the best! The sandwich appears small, but don't let it fool you.. It is filling... Thinking it was small, I also tried the chicken empanada! Yum.. It was so good, I kept eating it, although I was full.   2nd visit, I called ahead of time to have the Hallaca  which is a mixture of beef, pork, chicken, rasins, vegetables, olives, and capers wrapped in cornmeal dough, and finally, wrapped in plantain leaves, tied with string, and boiled after. Top it off with the creamy cilantro.. YUM! Another great combination of flavors you won't experience anywhere else. I also tried a pastelito, the ground beef and rice.. another great choice.   3rd visit, I went with a cold arepa, the vegetarian.. Lots of great taste, but very hard to eat. It kept sliding so I couldn't take a bite of all the flavors at one time. But the individual flavors did not disappoint. Again, very filling, so don't let the size fool you.   All 3 visits the food tasted great, fresh and the service from Felix is fantastic.  I plan to be a regular here.. It's that good!"}
{"text":"The man that took and made my order was very nice. Service was fast and there was seating outside the food stand. There were some birds that kept getting closer and closer trying to get free food from me; I just told them to go away. I looked like a crazy person talking to the birds, but I didn't want to share my arepas!  This food stand literally sits on a corner. It's kind of scary because it is Downtown, but I went around noon, so it wasn't too bad.  The arepas were good! I got the shredded beef. Beef was definitely spilling out of the bread pocket. It was moist and flavorful. They also sell canned sodas.   I definitely want more, I just need someone to go with me next time."}
{"text":"First the cons because this will be quick: the parking is very limited and sits on the busy Las Vegas Blvd.  Pros: the place is very authentic and the tastes are amazing. Highly recommend the chicken and probably second would be the pulled pork. The chicken has a smoke flavor and is marinated or basted in a pretty great sauce. Also highly recommend the green sauce. They have 2 and one is spicy -I stayed away from that one.   Another concern I know I have when it's clear food is authentic is how sanitary the kitchen is. It seems the best tasting foods come from suspect kitchens - not here. They have an A rating from the food/health inspectors."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Vegas kind of lacks in the latin food department and by that I mean everything except Mexican food. I am delighted to see some authentic south american (Venezuelan) fare.    I LOOOOOVE their EVERYTHING. The Arepas here are perfection...fluffy pillows stuffed with goodies and the empanadas are to die for. I highly recommend trying one of everything.   My faves:  Arepas: Garlic Shrimp, shredded beef Empanadas: Shredded Chicken, Bacalao (cod fish)  Also you absolutely have to try the passion fruit juice (parchita)...this is probably one of two places in all of Vegas I've found that serves this...  Also kudos for keeping late hours to satisfy my cravings :)"}
{"text":"Was driving around and seen this place and had never  ate Arepas before so decided  to try it. Area is in the ghetto  part of Vegas in my opinion and the store looks likes its been there for a few years.   As I  walked in was greeted and asked to have order taken and asked for recommendations and order 2 different  Arepas and a Enpanada. When the food came out I  added some of the sauces and the food was good, but the portion  in my opinion  is kinda small.   Wouldn't  really try  them again if I  had other options."}
{"text":"Meh.   The food was different, I will give it that. I ordered the reina and the chicken arepa. They tasted like a stuffed sopapilla (sort of). I guess I was expecting something else..HOWEVER, their orange drink was awesome."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas for work but didn't want the usual suspects on the main strip. I pulled up Yelp to find something with character and taste and did I ever find it! I've been eating arepas and cachapas for years having many Venezuelan friends, but in terms of restaurants, it's few and far between. Lucky for Las Vegas this gem of a restaurant is as good as it gets. The flavors were spot on and perfect in every way. I ordered the Reina Pepiada arepa along with a cachapa. Just the right temperature, just the right texture, just the right taste. I wanted to order more but simply didn't have room, so in the spirit of things I ordered another cachapa for the road. I look forward to going back, and bringing friends/family next time!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place but it's far from the \"hip\" places.  Number four and seven were great. Avocado side sauce was excellent too.  Definitely worth the drive/walk. The ice cream shop beside it is also crazy delicious.   I would bet my two pinky toes you will be very happy after leaving these two places."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to point out for the record to all my fellow mexican brethren and Mexican food lovers, a Venezuelan arepa is nothing more than a Mexican gordita! Delicious! I can't even tell you how many times we've passed this little spot on trips to downtown during Las Vegas trips past. I'm sure you've passed it a time or two if you are one of those people searching for the \"Pawn Stars\" pawn shop. Located on the corner of Las Vegas. Blvd. and Charleston Blvd not too far from the Stratosphere, this little shack should be added to your LV food agenda.   Six of us went, and five of us liked it and this is what we had:  Reina peinada- cold chicken salad with a cilantro and avocado cream sauce dressing. A little bland for my taste, but enhanced with some type of salsa they had, it was perfect. Not spicy, but had enough kick to add extra flavor. My wife said it had beer in it, but I couldn't taste it......probably cause I had already been drinking beer.  Ground beef- unanimous favorite of my group. Perfectly seasoned. Didn't need anything. Hot, juicy and flavorful!  Pastrami and cheese- supposed to be cold,  came out hot, probably from grilling the arepa. Not bad, but nothing special I'd say, lose the pastrami and just get one with cheese all on its own cause that's all I really tasted on this one, and the cheese was good.  Agua de panela- sugar cane juice with lime. Picture looks more like piloncillo/panocha, brown sugar-ish. Very tasty. Reminded me of agua de tamarindo or malta which was probably the tang from the lime. Everyone in my group liked it but kept fighting about whether it would go better with tequila or vodka. Guess I'll just have to take both next time to test it out, all in the name of science of course! All in all   will have to come back to try other things on the menu. Ran in to a lady in line that was from Venezuela and she said she and her family love it and go there at least once a week because its the real deal"}
{"text":"Viva la vida!!! What a find!! I first tried arepas in Cartagena, Colombia, small, warm, homemade delicacies with cheese that started my morning with a happy smile. But I had never had the Venezuelan arepa and to my delight, enjoyed such a satisfying meal that it compelled me to write my first spontaneous review within the same day of eating at a restaurant. This place is a hidden gem off the main strip, near the Stratosphere and I Luv it Custard that is well worth the visit!   They cook using wood...the meat is savory and soft, juicy...the flavors are full and satisfying...We tried the arepa with shredded beef, as well as the carne asada oneand the vegetarian arepa along with the plantains and fried yuca...YUM!! The cilantro and hot sauces were delicioso!!! Try a Malta Polar or Frescolita to drink or my favorite ever, fresh squeezed passion fruit juice for some different and delicious flavors.  But whatever you do get yourself to Viva Las Arepas pronto!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of an arepa and never would have thought to venture to this little spot as I don't drive along this street. But based on a few yelp friends reviews I ventured. I am glad I did.... The place is small, but seems pretty clean. It was definitely crowded at lunch time. The service was excellent as the woman taking my order was helpful and the woman who brought me my to-go order made sure we had all we needed.  The only thing was while waiting for the to-go order I felt I was in the way.  The food was great. I got the shredded chicken arepa and it was great... The melted cheese with tomato and all was great. I also picked up a pork butt arepa, carne asada arepa and a shredded beef empanada. They were all good with the carne asada chopped up for all the flavor but our favorite of the three was the pork butt as packed full of spices!  We were both very full and thoroughly enjoyed the meal! Glad I ventured"}
{"text":"Being from Miami of Venezuelan descent, arepas are near and dear to my heart and a favorite of my stomach. So I was happy to discover this, especially so close to my gym (good motivation to work out hard, lol!)  I have never seen such a layout of multilingual menus before (in Miami it's just spanish lol). Plus the staff was very nice and made ordering easy. I had the carne mechada arepa and empanada with queso. It was piping hot and very good. The sauces were also excellent, not too watery or too thick.   My only gripe is that I'm used to queso guayanes on the arepa, which is a very thick cut, semisoft cheese that doesn't quite melt - giving an extra texture to the arepa. I'm not sure what type of cheese they used here, but it was thin and melted through. It was good, but I have never had it like that before. If they provided that (and perhaps I ordered wrong), this would be perfect."}
{"text":"Great gluten free food! The pork arepa is especially good. The plantains are my favorite, but the plantains are not gluten free. I will definitely come back here, I really liked it."}
{"text":"I love Viva Arepas. I have been a fan of their food since they were at the small walk up joint in front of Dino's. Just had a chicken arepa with fried plantains. Yummy. Two small complaints... my guest had the shrimp arepa and it was overcooked & mushy (I don't eat shrimp but she is a foodie like me so I trust her judgment). And the last time I ordered a full chicken, it took longer than expected (but they had just opened the full restaurant & it may have been a matter of soft opening timing). But other than these minor items, this place is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I had never had an arepa (arepas?) before, and my coworker suggested this place. I was definitely skeptical given the surroundings, and also because we got lost. Anyhoo, we walked in and it was packed!! The lunch line was practically out the door which is always a good sign. I didn't know what was up and what was down, so I trusted her judgment on what to order, and the menu board has stars by the most popular items as well. I got the chicken arepa with avocado, some sort of lime/mayo sauce, and peas. I have a major thing for any food item with guava as well, so I grabbed a guava & cheese pastry. The wait for food to go wasn't too horrible, but I wouldn't say it was quick.   The pastry unfortunately was downright gross. I am assuming that the cheese was supposed to be melted considering it was a hot pastry, but when I bit into it, there was just a hard and rubbery stick of white cheese in the middle. The guava jam was slightly bitter, and needless to say, I was disappointed. The chicken arepa was good, but find me something with avocado and lime that isn't!"}
{"text":"The Reina Pepiada arepa is hands down the best on the menu. Carne Asada and pollo asado mechado are also very good. There's actually not even a bad thing on this menu. The rice and black beans and other sides come in a very generous serving for the price! 5 stars for Ramon for great service and helpfulness."}
{"text":"Just had a good meal here. Love the local places when in Vegas. Treat yourself here for good eats then walk next store to Art of Flavors for gelato. Can't go wrong. Ate here again this is amazing food and the staff bend over backwards to help. Love it"}
{"text":"So tasty! Arepas are one of those amazing foods a lot of people haven't discovered yet. Even if you have, though, Viva Las Arepas is a must try! They're friendly, quick, and give plenty of sauces for dipping and smothering your arepas in."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I'm finally writing a review. I have to say it's the best!  I've had:  * Shredded Chicken (Onion, Tomato, Garlic)  * Roasted Pork Butt (Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices)  * Reina Pepiada (Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas)  * Vegetarian (Avocado, Black Beans, Tomatoes, Grilled Peppers, Onions)  I have been satisfied with every one of them. My boyfriend has had the Beef, Pork, and Beef Tongue. His remarks are that they are good, hearty and inexpensive. One is enough for me on each visit because they can fill you up rather quickly. I love their sauces! There is a creamy cilantro dressing and a nice and spicy green sauce, which I drizzle over my Arepa!  Authentic, fresh ingredients, fast and friendly service. This place has become one of my favorite spots to go to when I'm craving Venezuelan food.  Also, don't forget their Hallacas (A mix of beef, pork, chicken, capers, raisins, olives, and vegetables on cornmeal dough, wrapped with plantain leaves, that is bolied) They are like my mother's Central American tamales and they are GOOD!  I feel the flavors are great, but I have a low sodium diet most of the time and felt it was a tad too salty, but that's just me. Nothing that bothers me too much, but giving the heads up for those picky eaters."}
{"text":"I kept driving by this place on the last few trips to Vegas. We got into town early this time and decided to eat there. The arepas are perfect, with the chicken and the black bean ones being my favorite. The green sauce is pretty on point as well. It sits on a corner lot with plenty of parking, the staff is nice and they clientele seems to be locals and out of towners. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"NO LATIN TRANSLATOR NECESSARY!  It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.  Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.  Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.  As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.  The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars.   So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!"}
{"text":"SO AMAZING. The vegetarian options are delicious, we were all so impressed! Really authentic, especially for being in Las Vegas! Oh, and their salsa! Too good. We'll be back without a doubt before we head back to Dallas."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.  U should just try it like I did, and you will fall in love and dream about it for days.  Must haves for me are : cachapas con queso, pork spare ribs (also comes with two sides) I chose yucca fries and fried plantains, yum! And the Shredded beef arepas. But I haven't tried everything..... Yet! So those are my favorites so far."}
{"text":"I love going here. Very unique menu in a relaxed setting and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places lunch in Downtown Las Vegas! It's on the corner of a shopping center that is across the street from the Goodwich. The parking lot can get a little crazy, but it will be worth it for the food. I love the chicken and cheese arepa. Tons of sauces to try on them. Get the plantains for dessert!"}
{"text":"If I wasn't sitting shotgun to a Vegas local, I would have never made it to Viva Las Arepas... bonus points for a punny and city-appropriate name. Seeing that it's far removed in all directions from the \"action,\" and the fact that I have never had an arepa before would have made it next to impossible for me to find it or even want to go there. Props to my buddy for carting us around and opening my eyes to something new and incredibly awesome. Thank, Drew-fus.  The place is clean, there are pictures lining the wall, the menus are in both Spanish and English, (great sign), and ordering is a simple as strolling up to the counter and taking a chance - something tells me that it's hard to go wrong here. I ordered the hot garlic shrimp arepa and the grilled chicken empenada. If you have never had an arepa, I really don't know how to describe it. I guess it's like a crumbly corn bun with your choice of filling piled up in the middle. Does that sound right or even make sense? Who cares, they're delicious! So great in fact that I've now tracked down a few places in SD serving arepas that I can only hope compare to what VLA is serving up in Sin City. Oh yeah, the empenada gets some love too. The grilled chicken that they loaded up in that bad boy with a drizzle of their house sauces made for a perfect and timely hangover cure."}
{"text":"I found this place because I happen to live close by and saw all the reviews  so hey why not give it a try?  YUMMY YUMMY if u haven't tried this place make sure that you do or you are missing out    I ordered chicken empanadas ( they were decent) not the best I've had but the REINA PEPIADA  delicious I suggest you try this one for sure amazing flavor great meat    I got the passion fruit juice I've only had it when I go to Latin countries so it was nice to get some here I LOVE passion fruit juice I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"First time checking out this place and all I have to say I'm a fan of arepas! I had the Chicken Reina Pepiada and everything about it was delicious. When you first take a look at these arepas they look small, but once you start eating more it starts to get filling. So you'll do fine with one. You must also try the soursop drink which is so refreshing and makes you want to drink more. I wish they made soursop shakes because those are amazing. Next time I go back I definitely want to try the empanadas they looked so tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped by I Love Arepas on the way home from a daytime pool session at the Golden Nugget. After swimming, sunning, and bearing that awesomely scary water slide, I was hungry but didn't want to fill up on anything too heavy in anticipation for a dinner later that night. So I figured arepas would be a good meal to hold me over without making me feel too full. And for less than $10 I was able to get 2 arepas and a drink. Not a bad deal!  They're open from 3pm to midnight everyday are located on the corner of Wyoming and LV Blvd, in the same parking lot as Dino's.   An arepa is most like a Venezuelan version of gordita, but it's stuffed with meat, cheese, or whatever else you'd like. I think my favorite part of the whole experience was the masa cake, because it was grilled but still soft and warm inside. They were obviously freshly made, and made really well.   I got the beef tongue arepa with had tomato, onion, and a green pepper in it. It was very greasy and messy, but not in a bad way where you feel like you need to run 10 miles after eating all that grease. The second arepas was the reina pepiada which was stuffed with cold chicken salad made with chicken, peas, avocado, onion, and was also very messy. They were both amazing tasting, and he gave me 2 sauces to go with them. One was a creamy cilantro-type dressing, and the second was more of a salsa-like one that tasted like it was made out of green peppers. The salsa one went really well with the beef tongue, and I felt that the reina pepiada didn't really need a sauce. I'm sure it goes well with something, but next time I stop by I'll try it with something else.   The passion fruit drink was good, but after I ordered it I saw he had soursop, which I'll definitely have to try next time."}
{"text":"Probably my best meal in Vegas.  Simple, creative unique food made from fresh ingredients.  The prices are pretty reasonable.  The place has a fast food vibe, and that's really the only downside.  Order a few arepas depending on which ones sound best.  The beef empanada was a particular treat, as were the pork rinds and yucca.  A huge meal for two comes in around $25.  You can walk here from the Stratosphere in about ten minutes."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, thanks Yelpers for the awesome recommendation! I can see this place being a go to spot every time I hit up Vegas now! This place is way off from the usual hang out areas, but it's worth the trip if you have a car, are willing to walk to bfe, or take a taxi to bfe (by Vegas standards).  I ordered the shredded beef with passion fruit juice to wash it all down. The price was really cheap ($4 for the arepas and $2.50 for the drink) and completely worth it. The arepas was super tasty (and I really want to know what the \"bun\" was made out of. It came with two sauces that I have no idea what they were, but I used them anyway. One was spicy and the other was creamier - I of course, went for the spicier one because it has more flavor to bust through the strong flavors of the shredded beef and added a bit of a kick to the food. So so so worth it. The juice was really delicious and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Wow. What a difference since the first visit. I ordered the same thing I had before, shrimp arepa, yucca fries, and soursop.   I took a bite of my arepa and immediately had to spit it out. The shrimp tasted rotten and the arepa was so greasy it made me sick just looking at. Then I bit into the yucca fries, they were dry rotted.   $14 for one arepa, fries and a drink. I'm so mad at myself for not going back and demanding a refund for nasty, rotten food.   Never again."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly on Yelp.. It was late night, the guy working was super nice, and food turned out super delish!  Nicely tucked away at the end of the strip. Great for late night eats."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! If you ask, they will make you a vegan arepa. Every time it get some to go they always put something extra in my order for example the fried plantains. You cannot go wrong with anything here. Yum."}
{"text":"I don't why people are so hype about this place. maybe because the hot weather makes me not feel good when I eat this."}
{"text":"Just ate here, food was ok, not as good as Las Vegas blvd location, tipped 9 bucks anyways, I asked the guy for a refill on my small iced tea, he wanted to charge me two bucks. Never mind.  I'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I normally never write reviews but I absolutely love Arepas! Great barbeque, at great prices. and I always receive fast, friendly service. Ramon is usually behind the counter when I come in and he always greets me with my name and a smile. He'll even bring out the food n drinks directly to me if its not too busy. I live close to the restaurant so I eat at Arepas at least once a week( I even have the punch card lol) and I've never had a bad experience. I usually get the wood fire beef plate and the beef is always super tender and in big portions. The cook is very friendly as well and I always leave satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great prices! Visiting from out of town, I was not happy with several places regarding service and food quality. However, this place surpassed my expectations. True authentic Venezuelan food. The food is freshly made and very well represented.   Recommendations: Cachapas, arepas de carne mechada y Reina pepiada! I will be coming here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you have never had arepas, they are a pocket like sandwich made from corn. They are stuffed with different fillings. I had the shredded beef and my husband had the carne asada. When i say carne asada don't be fooled to think it's like Mexican style carne asada. This meat was smoked and it had a distinct mesquite taste! Both delicious just a different twist to this way of cooking the meat. We also had chicken empanadas. They chicken also had a the mesquite taste. The empanadas were not my favorite but not terrible either. They were just fried and airy. So when you bite into it there is a huge gap between the meat and the dough. I prefer Mexican style empanadas or Cuban style. These Venezuelans style were not my cup of tea. The tostones were really good! They were a perfect crisp and the perfect saltiness. The place is located in old Vegas. The neighborhood is sketchy but if you go in the day time it's ok. The inside is really clean and so are the restrooms which is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   I ordered the chicken arepas and added avocado and a fried egg.  The chicken was house smoked and it was so wonderful!!! I was smelling smoke on my hands for the rest of the evening!  I also ordered the sweet corn arepas and it was also so tasty! Wonderful balance of sweet corn and mozzarella cheese.  I finished off the meal with a fried ravioli that had coconut in it.  Not too heavy or greasy.  This place is amazing and also cheap!  If you are staying on the strip just take the bus and it drops you off practically across the street.  Definitely worth the trip especially if you want cheap delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way to downtown LV to check this place out and it was good. Arepa was delicious but the  yuca Frita was a bit greasy and salty for me.  Yuca didn't have that fresh crunch you normally would get when its fried. Overall service was great staff was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"If you've never had an (Venezuelan) Arepa give it a shot.  It's kinda like a taco in a split open pita.  They have a free parking lot (bonus) !"}
{"text":"Their second location, by Rainbow and Charleston, is clean and spacious. Order at the counter and food is served up fairly quickly. I haven't waited more than 10 minutes before receiving my orders on a couple separate occasions. My favorite so far has been the Pabellon ($7), filled with savory beef, black beans, plantains and cheese. The roasted pork butt arepa would have benefitted from more seasoning, but the combination of the tender pork and tomato slices still made it worth getting. I wasn't a big fan of the garlic shrimp served cold, but it was certainly filling. As a side, the fried plantains were a nice addition with their mild sweetness."}
{"text":"The food is delicious the customer service was excellent the price very reasonable the chicken arepa was very good the fresh drinks are yummy too.  the restaurant is nice and clean beans I was very pleased with my experience there I highly recommend it to any one that was to try some Venezuelan food."}
{"text":"My first time eating food from Venezuela and it was very good.  I had arepa with chicken in it I also had fried yuca it looked like thick French fries but from yuca root it was very good and I had a passion fruit drink it was amazing. But what made it even better was  the great customer service me and my friend got they were very friendly the waiter named Toni was very kind to us he explained all the questions we had about different foods and me and my friend had  lots  of questions but he went out if his way to help us and to explained all the questions we had.  I will defenetly go back to try a different dish. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Warning to everyone: this location is in a pretty shady area of the strip. So if you're feeling the late night munchers, I'd suggest going with other people. I went with a few yelpers around 10 pm and I was still fearful for my life when this bum haggled us for a dollar. Thanks to Angela H. for making him go away!!!   Ok with that being said, I can now move on to the real review.  So after the CMYE 51s game, a few of us were still feeling like fatties since baseball food is gross and unfulfilling. After a list of places (Tacos El Gordo, Triple 7, this other taco stand that Anthony M. mentioned which I forgot the name of), we decided on this place. Rolled in about 10 minutes before closing. The workers were not annoyed to see us right before closing. Props to them because I would be irritated seeing people strolling in right before closing.   The arepa I ordered was delish. It reminded me of a tamale but in sandwhich form. It was packed full of meat and vegetables. Definitely more meat to vegetable ratio, but still a good thing. The bread (or masa or whatever its made of) was flaky and buttery and the meat was tender and cooked just right. Came with a bottle of cilantro mayo sauce thing and some hot sauce. Both made the arepa even more tasty. I could have easily finished mine if it weren't for the beers I drank earlier.   Definitely a good lunch spot or late night dinner spot if you are in the area. Like I said earlier, just be careful when you get out of your car."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for dinner. I got a #2 chicken arepa and a #12 corn and queso arepa. The chicken one was quite greasy but had great flavor. My corn and queso arepa, however, was very sweet and tasted like a pancake! It wasnt for me at all. Guanabana juice was delicious! We will probably be back to give it another go! Service was good too."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite dining spots in Las Vegas. I made a recent trip last weekend, and I forgot how badly I missed eating an arepa. I always get La Reina Pepieda, which is a scrumptious chicken salad mix, made from chicken, avocado, cilantro and cream. I also get the carne asada arepa with queso and avocado, and order a side of plantains. The dough holding the meat is made of a corn mixture; almost like a Mexican sope and tamale fusion.. The taste is so unique and delicious you will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Clean and Delicious - lives up to its 4.5 stars on yelp.  Located between downtown between the north strip ( stratosphere) and downtown  on the corner of oak and Las Vegas blvd, I noticed this place. Checked out the reviews and made the decision to check it out when my brunch plans got sidelined. It's located next to a gelato place ( yes there is an adult store, nail place and chapel but it's vegas-- I saw lots of kids eating here with familia  For a Sunday- lots of people ( in a good way) grubbing but not long of a wit for food or ordering. I was going to order the garlic shrimp and chicken but the gent at the register recommended #12 since it was my first time there..beef, black bean plantain and cheese. Both items I choose were $7, I got an order of fried plantain ($3) and an avocado upgrade ($1 big portion). I like it when people take pride in their food establishment to point people toward stellar items.  I had them place everything so I could eat on the patio-- great green salsa with a nice kick. Garlic shrimp was juicy so be warned because my shirt got hit.. -#12 was good too.  Totally full in a good way- much better choice then the buffet... :) on my face.The do have arepas that are $5 and vegetarian...so one could easily eat for $10 or less. I just wanted to try out more items.   My only problem was in my to go order they didn't give me napkins and forgot my avocado but that was a small glitch- just check your order :)"}
{"text":"I dont get to come here often because I live in Henderson.... New guy at the counter was very was so friendly and went over my order.... I asked about the wood and the cook behind the counter jumped right up to help him.... I complemented them both on teamwork I payed and then asked about the coffee.. I asked if it was good ... He said right away yes! He was right... They have good coffee too.... Love that they always have good service!!! Left there saying to myself...... awwwww"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place since moving downtown, but I was not able to make it there, until today that is! The food is great. I recommend numbers 2 and 7. The empanadas are a great to go snack too if you don't have much time and need a quick fix. Viva las arepas!!"}
{"text":"Was wondering around old Las Vegas hmmmm Venezuelan arepas lets give it a try 11 pm better than any of the fast food around the area.  Thumbs up Port butt was delicious and emependsas piping hot go to this authentic place."}
{"text":"Had to try this spot due to the excellent reviews, and I was in the area. We ordered the shrimp and steak arepa and some \"french-fry like\" fried yukka root, since the guy at the register said they were the most popular. Mind you, I am a foodie at heart and this was my first time having Venezuelan food. Each arepa is about $7.00. The portion size was a lot smaller than they looked and I left feeling only semi-full. They are similar to pupusas.  Overall, good food but maybe I had high expectations that weren't exactly filled."}
{"text":"Price is pretty high for 1 small arepa.... It was GOOD but I've had better. Ample parking & a lot of tables inside to sit at. The staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Totally delicious!! If you've never tried Venezuelan food, GO HERE. The food is all very fresh and there are tons of options to choose from."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week (twice) with a party of 8 for the best empanadas ever! The service was also exceptional.   A piece broke off of one and they offered to make a new just because they take pride in their food.   Also tried the fried plaintains and grilled pork & beef! Delicious is an understatement and awesomely priced!"}
{"text":"The best Arepas that I have ever had, be it that they are the only Arepas that I have ever had. I recommend the Cachapas with shredded beef its an up charge as its not on the menu, but it is a great blend of sweet and savory!!"}
{"text":"OMG the empandas are so yummy, the staff is so pleasant and so nice, It was my first time there and they were patient, offered me samples of the real fruit drinks and made me feel like i have been dining with them forever! i have definitely found my new spot :)."}
{"text":"Had the pork butt Arepas with cheese and avocado and shredded beef chopada and passion fruit drink for $19. A lot of food but it was good."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome best kept secret! Who knew a little food truck would be so good! Super cheap too!"}
{"text":"I simply love this place. Whenever I'm in Vegas I make sure I stop in for the pork butt arepa. I also love the rice and beans, and don't forget to add their sauces."}
{"text":"July 2011  Never heard of Arepas?  You aren't alone.  This was a Yelp find by my girlfriend and we just had to try it.   Pros:  +  i Love Arepas !  + Open late  + Friendly staff  + Awesome Hot sauce  Cons:   -  N/A    Overall:   I'm not a Venezuelan expert or anything, but the easiest way to describe it is a Venezuelan version of a taco.  I don't really know how else to explain it ha.  You just gotta try it for yourself!  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  This place is addicting.  I personally loved the Lengua Arepa... Tongue for those who do not know.  It's located on the north end of the strip.  It's just a little stand with a few tables for seating, but don't judge the book by its' cover.  This was a pleasant surprise!  Next time I go, I'm going to try one of their Fruit Juices... I hear they are pretty good.  Tips:  -  I didn't know how filling 1 Arepa was.  I ordered 3 Arepas thinking it was equivalent of 3 tacos at say Don Tortacos, but I was wrong.  Arepas are a lot heavier than a taco.  I'd say 2 and your good to go.  -  If you like spicy hot... try their hot sauce.  It has a good kick to it.  -  Don't forget to grab some extra napkins... you're gonna need it.  -  They take card so don't worry if you don't have cash."}
{"text":"Best grub for $10 in Vegas. Fresh meats, gluten free if you want it. Fried plantains are amazing! We had the Arapas with chicken, beef and shrimp, all were so good! Ribs look incredible too.  New location with outdoor patio! We will be coming back... Often!"}
{"text":"This place has changed a bit since it first opened, or at least a year or so ago when if you had asked me about it, I would have RAVED. It's still good, decent, and interesting food, but something seems to have fallen off in terms of quality, flavor, and maybe even cooking technique, I'm not sure. Also, there is a real grunge factor here that was not here when we used to come here a year or two ago.  It just feels dirty now.  Our table was dirty and the bathrooms don't feel sparkly.  The process to put away your tray basket is just a little off-putting--at the trash can, it's just gross.  This is kind of like how Rubio's does it, but they're a chain.  They should have someone come pick up the baskets. No one comes by to wipe down the tables, or brush crumbs off seats.  The customer service seems lacking.They can't control the weird folks who come in here for arepas--a delicious specialty of Venezuela; think Jamaican beef patties.  But with the proper atmosphere, they would attract a less volatile crowd, for lack of a better word.  It used to be trendy, now it feel grungy.  Does that make sense? It may depend on what time of day or what day of the week you come.  A Sunday night, when we went, might not be its best.  With that said, if you have a hankering for Venezuelan food, or arepas in particular, you could do a lot worse than here.  The chicken (salad) arepas are unique with a piquant taste (not quite spicy).  I prefer the grilled chicken, and then pork or beef arepas, which are chock full of meat with crispy corn covering.  Vegetables are not too big here, but there is lettuce. Parking can be challenging.  It is a small lot."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  I was looking for something small and not drenched in oil.  Decided to try this place out and I'm so glad I did.. It looks like a small diner, but the food feels like authentic home cooked Latin food, not the \"fusion\" stuff popping up everywhere....  I had never eaten Venezuelan so I wasn't sure what to expect but I had the yucca and chicharron which is common in Nicaragua and a calchapa, this reminded me of a sweet corn tamale but with lots of cheese in it.  My husband had a pabellon, kind of looks like a Mexican gordita and had beef, black beans, and platano in it.  All in all, everything was amazing, we ended with a coconut and cheese pastelito! Great place to check out, wish it would come to San Francisco."}
{"text":". Had the chicken arepa and beef empanada. Both were hot and very tasty. The sauce in the yellow bottle was the kicker for me. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I adore this place! I really do :-) The food is so good here and the service is just wonderful. It looks like a little shack across the street from the OG so based on location and looks alone it feels a little sketchy but thats actually part of the charm :-) You order the food but the servers will bring it out to you in the car. We had the chicken arepas, chicken empanadas and a cheese empanadas. Everything was really tasty :-) The sauces they give you are wonderful also. I loved the green sauce the flavor was so delish....somebody (my husband) should had warned me about how hot the red sauce was though...that stuff was HOT!! So I'm going to warn you all, try a little at first cause its HOT!"}
{"text":"All I have ever known about arepas is from Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Man, these were delicious! Let's start with the arepas... With the masa/bun holding it together- I didn't get a big hit of corn till the end, which was fine (I do love corn tortillas though). The one episode I watched, they did a classic Chicken, Avocado, and Mayo Arepa, three of my favorite items! I chose that #7.   I got a side of plantains, one sweet and one not- tbh I couldn't tell the difference, they were delicious! The dipping sauce was a mixture of cream cheese, butter, and sugar and more like a frosting (not my fave). I also got the black beans and white rice, delicioso!   I went to the Strip location and the area was not the best but that's where you usually find the best food! I also took my order to go, since it was close to closing time so I don't really have a review on the restaurant itself!"}
{"text":"My mouth waters every time I think of that corn and cheese pancake thing. Soooo good! The arepas were good too. Especially the shredded beef! I will definitely be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"This was by far the cheapest and the BEST thing I ate over 4 days in Vegas -- even better than dinner at Bouchon. The people working were incredibly helpful and nice, the restaurant was clean, and the food came quickly. I will definitely head back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"All of the food is delicious and service is great too. Their hot shrimp arepa and sauces will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Venezuelan  food, and let me tell you I love it!! The arepas are super good and so are there juice drinks!"}
{"text":"Go, just go. Nothing I write will do their arepas justice. Make sure you hit up the gelato next door when you are done. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great, however has unlimited potential. Saw this driving down the strip on the way to downtown LV and made trek back. Menu is very meaty so if your a vegan it's time to bail. Now I always order several items to sample the goods. We ordered beef sandwich which was moist and flavorful so a thumbs up to the chef. The chicken thighs were over cooked but if they hadn't I suspect they would be unbelievable. Same goes for spareribs I ordered but a few of them were spot on and meat fell off the bone. ( yum )  The interior is nothing to be excited about, it's just a run down diner kinda. But I'm sure in time things will improve but I'd say try coming in and sample a few things. Worth the time and pricing around $10 per item."}
{"text":"Best Food Truck food I have ever had, best part, it doesnt move!  Its on LV BLVD at Wyoming across from the world famous Olympic Garden.   Easy in Easy Out, no lines, and talk about some yummy stuff.  I got the Pork style Arepas and it was absolutely Amazing!   I put the hot sauce the provide from a small ketchup squeeze bottle, as well as the white sause they gave me too.  A little of each for every bite.  I was so satified and happy, I almost fainted, from the heat of the day and my amazing food.  Latin food is in full swing at this little place.  I had am empanada after with chicken, it was deep fried, and super duper hot, I had to on up and see its yummy goodness and let it cool for a minute before I started on it.   This was a work of art on a plate, and tasted just as numby, yummy, get in my tummy!    Highly Recommended, with drink and two items $9 bucks.  without drink or second item, $5 bucks.   Its doesnt get this good normally for $5 bucks.  Come hungry, leave satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"Had the arepa with the carne and the best I can say about it is that it was filling and the green sauce you squirt onto it is great.   But the actual arepa wasn't flavorful and it didn't really make me want to try it again or have another one. It wasn't bad it just wasn't good.   There are just so many other tasty things to spend my money on. I hope pupusas are good..."}
{"text":"So delicious.   Whether you've had a long Vegas night, or you're a vegetarian, a carnivore, a gluten avoiding eater, anything, come here!  We love everything here.  The mixed grill is perfection, and all of the arepas are delicious. We are fans of the pulled pork, beef, chicken with avocado and cheese, ham and cheese, and the fried platiains are crispy and addicting!  Sometimes arepas are super greasy and heavy, but this place does them right!  You will not go wrong with anything you eat here. Top it off with great service, lots of seating, and a fun restaurant, and you've got one of our go-to places when we're downtown! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night.  The food was very good but the arepas can be a bit pricey.  The business was very clean and the man who helped us was nice with good recommendations.  We will go back very soon once we finish our leftovers.  Thank you."}
{"text":"A must eat for locals and visitors. I eat here at least once a month made my way through the menu. My favorite is the #7 arepa ( chicken ) with bean and cheese empanada."}
{"text":"Having never eaten Venezuelan food before I did't have much to compare this to, but it was excellent! We ordered both beef & chicken empanadas, the reina pepiada, and a tequeno. The place was a little busy and it took about 10 minutes to get our food, but it only felt like forever because we were so hungry!  The restaurant was nice and clean, and the staff we interacted with were all friendly. I love that you can see into the kitchen area and watch them make your food too. Definitely some place we'd return to next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is SO good. Super clean place, amazingly friendly staff and some of the best food I have had in Vegas. Get a #1, add cheese and an egg. Throw on some of the cilantro  and hot sauce on every bite."}
{"text":"Just like a lot of places, I decided to try it out because I couldn't pick up a Vegas publication without reading something about this place!  I'm not sure what an Arepas was and how to pronounce it (nor do I even now!) but I can tell you it's wonderful!  The location is right across from another gem of mine, Luv It Frozen Custard on Oakey and LV Blvd.  Not sure how packed this place can get, but parking could become a problem.  I visited Saturday afternoon and didn't have too many issues.  So back to the food... I would describe an arepas as almost a Latin gyro sandwich.  Where you have a pita bread pocket stuffed with delicious meat.  You have several fillings to choose from, all of which are only $5!.  They also include a bottle of garlic sauce and hot sauce which helps add to the flavor of this pocket of tastiness.  All I know is I'm coming back here this weekend.  Just like how I refuse to have fast food that is not In N out, I most likely won't go back to Taco Bell in Vegas ever again!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! I always order #7 reina pepiada and it never fails in fulfilling my arepa cravings! Make sure you try that green sauce with it. I live about 20 minutes away but it is well worth the trip everytime. Just wish there was a another location closer to me."}
{"text":"Gotta love Vegas for having just about everything, including food options from all over the world. Let's just say I was a sheltered foodie when I lived in Arizona... I had never heard of Arepas before. I'm glad I stumbled across this place, as the food here is YUMMY! Bonus: vegetarian friendly :)"}
{"text":"The ribs are fantastic and the staff are very nice too.  My first swing at Venezualan food and I must say I will come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Really liked the food. Freshly made. Had the \"Reina Pepiada\" and Carne Asada Arepas. Both very good. Docked 1 star only because they didn't take my Entertainment Book coupon. Was told they wanted to discontinue it but pulled out to late. You'd figure they'd still honor it off its what brought us here to try it.  Still glad I tried it tho. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I only ordered the pork butt arepa, but I was disappointed. It tasted exactly like a pulled pork sandwich, without any real South American flavor. The only vegetable was a thin slice of tomato. I did see that the avocado arepa had more vegetables, so maybe I just chose poorly.  The bun itself was a bit soggy ~ I would have liked it a bit crispier. So overall, the food was just a mediocre experience.  I will say however that the staff were very friendly and authentically from Venezuela, so much so that I feel a bit bad giving a 3 star review."}
{"text":"It was really good u have to try the pollo a la brasa (grill chicken), an of course the arepa reina pepiada, pernil, pollo carne asada, this place is venezuela in vegas, i'm venezuelan so this place is a peace of my country on vegas"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now and I'm so glad we finally did! In fact, we ate here 3 days in a row.. it was THAT good! We tried the carne asada arepa, arepa reina pepiada, fried plantains with nata, pork spareribs plate, and fried pork rinds with yucca. While everything was really good, our favorites were definitely the fried pork with yucca and the carne asada arepa. I also need to mention the green sauce.. it's so good!! The restaurant was very clean, service was great, and the food came out pretty fast! We will definitely be coming back the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had a great,dinner a few,days ago at this restaurant a  and I love their chicken thighs especially because,it's very affordable and I keep coming back here"}
{"text":"Awesome, original,great flavors!  Empanadas were amazing and prices were great! We were looking for a new adventure and hadn't tried the Venezuelan twist on food so we took this place for a spin!   AWESOME!!! Then as we were leaving  we stopped in the ART of Flavor gelato store a door or two down and had the most amazing Gelato store I have found since I visited Italy!   Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely starving when I stopped into Viva Las Arepas and they took good care of me. I left completely satisfied and without even an ounce of hunger. All I needed to accomplish this were their Arepa Reina Pepiada (Chicken Breast, Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro) and Pabellon Plate (Shredded Beef, Rice, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese).  This was exactly what I needed and they are well deserving of all the rave reviews. Definitely a place I'd return to."}
{"text":"Gluten free, Vegan options! This place hands down is my new favorite! Outstanding food!"}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem Right Off Of The Strip. Prices Are Excellent. I Ordered Tostones(My Personal Favorite) And A Pork Arepa ...Super Fast Service.Ohhhh If Anyone Cares.. The Arepas Are Gluten Free. You Can Go Get Married Across The Street At The Little Wedding Chapel And Come Right Over To Viva Arepa For Your Reception Lo"}
{"text":"IT IS A MUST EAT PLACE. The food is AMAZING and really cheap and the guys are awesone. Sucks its kind of in a bad location but its worth going. Me and my gf got the shredded beef arepa and the number 7 I think, with shredded chicken peas and avocado. Everything was amazing so after we ate we went back and got empanadas. But those too were amazing and stuffed with beef and seasoned really well. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Glory Be. This is some Nom Eats.   Quality food. Fair prices. Great service. I don't know what authentic tastes like since I have never had my abuela make me one. But these cornmeal based sandwiches (think Johnny Cakes and and seared polenta had a baby)   Had not eaten a good meal in three days on the road. This was smack into flavor town. I loved it."}
{"text":"I will first start out by saying I am in no way an expert in this cuisine. In fact, this is my first time eating an arepa. I have seen this wonderful item many times on television, so when the opportunity came up to try it, I immediately jumped on the opportunity.  The restaurant, itself, was good sized and in an accessible location. Being just north of the Strip, it was pretty easy to get to. The restaurant has a fast-casual feel. If you want to grab and go, you can (but be advised that the food is prepared to order), or if you want to sit and relax you can. We decided to take in the environment, so we ate it.  The arepas were very delicious. They appear to be relatively small compared to similar items from different cuisines, but they were definitely filling. In this small package contained a plethora of great flavor profiles. We order several different arepas which include the roasted pork, ham and cheese, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. All were very good as we particularly enjoyed the roasted pork. Accompanying sauce were also flavorful and added to the depth of the arepas.  We also ordered the chicaronnes. This isn't all skin, but meat and skin. Deep fried goodness. This also came with fried yucca which almost resembled fat french fries. Excellent flavor - especially with the green sauce.  Defnitely worth the adventure when you're in Vegas.  FYI - It's on the corner of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"COME HERE!! from California and i definitely wanted some sweet arepa deliciousness!!  Nice little food stand with some chairs/ tables outside to sit or at the bar.  The arepas are quite filling even though they don't seem that big.  THe sauces that come with them are really delicious and make a perfect topping onto a Pork butt or #1 or shrimp arepa!! Those ones really stood out for me as I was eating.  Get a couple and share with friends so you can get some taste differences!  No bathrooms & no free tap water, so you'll BYO Drink or pay $1 for a drink.    Definitely delicious and i'm salivating thinking of it, this place definitely needs more people to pay them a visit and get some business!  Bottomline: Come here for a tasty arepas fix.  Get the #1 or pork butt or shrimp arepa."}
{"text":"Two for two. The food is so exceptionally great here. The prices are very reasonable. You should try this place. Try the chicken thighs!"}
{"text":"How lucky are we? One of our favorites now on Rainbow. We have been eating at the strip location for about 3 years and just heard about this location much closer to our house. This new location has the same feel as the original. Lots of bright yellow colors. The food hasn't lost a step with the new location. I tried the pork arepa and it was extraordinary. First bite and an explosion of flavor and unbelievably juicy. I added cheese and avocado. With those additions a very reasonable $6.50. So delicious it was!!!  Good luck to them with the new location. They have a large patio for outdoor seating that will be perfect. The food is so good. You need to give this a try!  Lovely people running both locations.  5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Muy ricas siempre que venimos a Las Vegas tenemos que pasar a comer aqui!!! Muy ricas!!! Se las recomiendo mucho."}
{"text":"Low quality food at outrageous prices. I wouldn't return there because the food tastes like shit"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm vegetarian. I got the vegetarian arepa with cheese. It was sooooo yummy. I will go back EVERYTIME I goto Vegas."}
{"text":"We we're in vegas for new years an went to this lilttle place. I try the arepa with Shrimp in ajillo,the ground beef one with cheese and the empanadas de pollo. The service was the best and the food was excellent and the price inexpensive. You and a friend and eat for 20.00 thats not bad."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this was an OK affair. Not something I would repeat - as there are tons of Mexican restaurants which have more variety and flavor. Fired plantains were good though. I also bought Soursop drink - was surprised to see 3/4 glass full of ice."}
{"text":"Flavor burst in yo mouth!  I woke up the next day and am still thinking about this place.  Similar to the Salvadoran pupusas, Viva Arepas maybe the best value you will get in Vegas.  If you're boring and only eat chicken strips and mash potatoes and god forbid don't like flavor, then don't come here.  But for $4 you will be taken through a bold and flavorful journey.  The masa cornmeal patty has the perfect texture, crisp on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  We had the shredded chicken based on a few locals who were parked at the bench.   The shredded beef emapanadas were pretty good but the arepas are the star of the show.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the meats.  I look forward to coming back VERY soon to try their lengua and pork butt.    Speaking of pork butt, these arepas fit perfectly in your hands. It really is the perfect grip second to the OG across the street but c'mon....that grip will cost you multiple trips at Viva!"}
{"text":"Stick to the Arepas, stay away from the mixta plate for two. It seemed to be scraps of meat thrown together. We did not enjoy it at all. The Arepa we split however was terrific. Wish we would have stuck to just the Arepas."}
{"text":"I've never had Venezuelan food before this so I don't have anything to compare this to but was the food good at Viva Las Arepas? Heck yeah. My boyfriend's been telling me about this place for a long time but I've always kind of been like... are they tacos? Why don't we just get tacos? Wrong.   I ordered the #7 (chicken and avocado) and #13 (corn and cheese) and my boyfriend got the #1 (wood fired chicken) and #2 (wood fired beef) along with fried plantains and the cane sugar drink. The drink was an interesting flavor.. sweet but sour/bitter as well. The plantains were bite sized and syrupy, probably could have skipped on those. The real winners are their arepas (duh). I really enjoyed the chicken avocado. It had shredded chicken and a creamy avocado mayo sauce that didn't make the arepa soggy. The maize.. buns? Are similar to a tamale but harder. After eating the chicken avocado I figured my boyfriend's wood fired chicken would be boring and dry but the flavor was amazing, having been cooked with mesquite wood. This was probably my favorite. The beef was similar but I felt the chicken soaked up the flavor of the wood better. The surprise dish was the cheese and corn (my boyfriend's favorite. We thought it was going to be cheese and corn in the arepa but it was actually more of a corn pancake with cheese. I wish I knew what kind of cheese, it was fairly mild and reminded me of feta in texture. This is a huge portion so I recommend sharing.   Overall I was delighted to be introduced to Venezuelan food and arepas and I'm already looking forward to bringing others here to share the love! Location isn't awesome but it's part of the charm. You can walk to Luv Its custard after to get some dessert or head to Dino's for some karaoke :)."}
{"text":"Here for a convention, my hotel was just .2 miles from Viva, which I remember from Food Networks DDD Show.  The Arepas were delicious, the ribs were fall off the bone, and the whole bill was less than some appetizers at a strip hotel. This is the real deal foodie experience, if you are ever at the north end of Vegas Boulevard, you gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Venezuelan food for lunch... Arepas in the following flavors carne asada (2), carne mechada (1), frijoles negros & queso (2), pernil (3) and camarones al ajillo (1)... Plus soda (5). Under $50. We needed half of this food, it was delicious but so filling for 5 of us.  Our favorite was the wood fired beef and the pork.  Next favorite was the black bean.    We didn't care for the shrimp.  It was good quality shrimp, but the combination just didn't work for us.  I think we were just used to having beef, pork or beans in this type of food.    Heavy, filling food.  If you have never tried Venezuelan food, this would be a great place to start!"}
{"text":"BAM! Been looking for an authentic Venezuelan place to get Arepas made as good as you can get in Caracas  AND THIS IS IT! What makes it so good? The Arepa is made with Pan which is a special starch to make the \"bread\" part of this sandwich. Next comes the fillings. Different combinations of flavors then what you'd expect to see here in the states. Ask the guys behind the counter for help if you get lost. The menu can overwhelm but it gives you an excuse to come back again and try them all! Each bite is loaded with spices! So good! Great for a quick bite, lunch, dinner or late night. Its on the corner in downtown Vegas which can be a bit dicey. I felt perfectly safe while there and we ate onsite. The inside reminds you of a fast food joint. Metal tables with short chairs. Red tile flooring. Small parking lot out front. I would definetly go back, take friends and tell everyone I know about this place. It is that good for what it is they do. AREPAS!"}
{"text":"The food here is always so delicious and fresh. I got the beef arepa and a chicken with cheese and salsa. Devoured them both and was full as a tick. Staff was nice and pleasant. Remembers repeat customers which always a plus."}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas for the past 15-20 years and never noticed this place. Due to my Peruvian heritage of course I thought I wouldn't like any of their food.   Empanadas have always been my favorite breakfast food, which in Peru, they are a breakfast food/pastry so I was totally skeptical about the fried empanadas.   The empanadas were amazing even though it was weird for me to eat them fried and for lunch.   We also ordered the cheese & bean arepas and it was amazing. Imagine a pancake of sweet corn with cheese and beans in the middle then another sweet corn pancake on top. It was amazing.   Anyone visiting Las Vegas should come here. You won't be disappointed. I wish they had a location in Virginia!!!!!  The staff was also very friendly and they have menus in English as well Spanish.   Awesome, awesome food & service!!!"}
{"text":"I had the #7 Chicken Arepa chef recommendation. Deliciously prepared and seasoned chicken with cilantro-avocado dressing. Yes, I got it with cheese. Washed it down with guava juice. Restaurant was easy to find being right on Las Vegas Blvd & Oakey.  Clean and tastefully decorated dining area; as well as the restroom. I was tempted to order more...but this order actually filled me up. I'm definitely going back. Take a look around the dining area for the different pictures of the meals offered on the menu. My friend had the fries too, which I took a couple, while he wasn't looking. Fries are just so-so. I'll order the fried plantains next time for a side. They looked a lot tastier. Overall, it's a fresh flavor Venezuelan restaurant offering great flavor and variety. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place and can't wait to go back to Vegas just so I can eat here again!!!! Way better than all that buffet food !!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow oh wow! Great authentic Venezuela food, Iam so glad I found it on Yelp and yelpers giving good feed back! All the food is great. Clean place, good Service"}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas is my favorite restaurant.  Every time I visit Las Vegas, I stop by here. Grilled meats and arepas taste great! Especially I love Pork Spare Rib and Chicken BBQ.  Another tasty dish is Pork Fried Rinds & Fried Yucca  Root. This restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, but they let the customers buy and bring bottles of alcohols from nearby stores.  I am looking forward to visiting here next time."}
{"text":"Great food from Venezuela love love love the arrows with chicken. Great for lunch or even breakfast"}
{"text":"For my Cuisine and Culture class I had to write about a cuisine I had not tried yet so I chose Viva Las Arepas.   Viva Las Arepas serves authentic Venezuelan food in a fast food like environment.   I came here with two of my classmates and we almost sampled every item on the menu. I personally ordered the garlic shrimp arepa; tequenes pastelitos; fried plantains; cheese empanada; and a mango beverage. The tequenes was the worst of them all; which contained an uncooked cheese stick in the middle. The arepa contained baby sized shrimp and was too fishy for my taste. The cheese empanada was tasty and the cheese was actually melted; mango beverage way too sweet; and the plantains while having a nice flavor were extremely greasy. The overall consensus on the food was that everything was too greasy.   I wish I was more a fan of the food here because it's right around the corner from my house and the owner Felix is a good man."}
{"text":"Ever since eating at Caracas arepa Bar in. NYC I've been on te hunt for good arepas in and surrounding Los Angeles. I'm very happy to say I've found another spot I know deem worthy in Las Vegas.  I was even happier to discover this is the same establishment that was once a small stand outside the neighboring bar Dino's.   You've come a long way and do not disappoint. The arepas are delicious and filling! Good sauce too. The decor isn't anything amazing, but this isn't the kind of place where it really matters. The restaurant was packed with what I'm assuming was mostly a local crowd since its a little off the main strip.   All I can say is there is now a quick and easy place for me to grab a bite that will compete with my outstanding craving for Capriottis.   Good job guys! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but its worth stopping. I came with a few friends which I'm very happy about since I was able to taste a few arepas. I tried the shredded beef, shredded chicken, tongue, pernil (roasted pork) and the reina pepiada (chicken and avocado mix)  I can't say which one was my favorite since they were all amazing. Each one is about $5 and I was pretty full after eating just one.  If you are in the area this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Ordered the wood fired chicken arepas, tequenos, the beef empanadas, pork rinds, and the spare ribs. Everything was delicious. Ribs were full of a smokey flavor. Beef empanadas were probably my favorite, followed closely by the tequenos. Tequenos were like fried cheese sticks. There was only one to an order, but it was plenty with all the other food we ordered."}
{"text":"Tasty.... but I feel there could be improvement. Maybe a bit more bang in the flavor.  I'll have to come back again sometime and then update my review. I've only been here once, so I don't want to give it 5 stars on my rating so far."}
{"text":"Great Venezuelan food. Best place to watch traffic on the strip."}
{"text":"I don't know why we haven't stumbled upon this place sooner! Everything we had, from the empanadas to the arepas, to the carne asada fries were bomb! I need to bring more people here in order to sample more things! Between my husband and I, we ordered way too many items - chorizo and potato empanada, two #3 arepas, a #12 and a #13 (the sweet corn and cheese one), and carne asada fries. We loved how smoky the meat was. It adds a whole other dimension of flavor to the experience.   Another one to add to our ever-growing list of great eats in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't know why yelp isn't updated but this place moved from a stand to a shop and the prices went way way up. Everything is from $6 and up including tax! That's double the prices the pictures are saying so you've been warned!   When you double your prices you got to do something different. Bigger sandwiches, something. These arepas are very good and a nice change from the usual Mexican food in LA, but it's not a good value. I would be perfectly happy paying $3, not the $6 I paid. The bread was clearly made fresh and it was good. The beef was very well seasoned. Unfortunately I wasn't satisfied. I would have been fine buying two for $6 but not 2 for $12. To be full you need 2 which makes the cost of these ridiculous!   No wonder why this very highly rated place had nobody in it. It seems as if they've passed on their added costs to the customers but that price hike scared everyone away. Amazing food or not I will not be back!!"}
{"text":"Right price, awesome food. I ordered the roasted pork butt arepa and the tostones (which are fried green plaintains). All was gluten-free, which is a major plus for me. The only downside was the section of town it was in. I actually decided to pass on by at first and not eat there...but just knew I would regret it. It was very good...don't let the location scare you. The inside is very clean."}
{"text":"If you're down in Vegas you need to try this its a little past stratosphere and crazy good. I got the carne asada arepa and added avocado and cheese. delicious, I will definately be coming back here when im in the area"}
{"text":"The area in which this restaurant is located is very sketchy. But, if you're not bothered by that or are an adventure seeker, by all means, go! Their food is authentic and great. The service is great also. The restaurant itself is spotlessly clean. We ordered some Empanadas (beef) and some Arepas (shredded chicken and black bean) and a few drinks. There are two bottles of sauce that are offered up with your food. The first is a reddish color and spicy and the second is an off-white sauce that is a blend of mayo, cilantro, garlic and lime juice that is absolutely delicious! I could put that on everything I eat and be very happy about it. So, we asked the recipe and she gave us the basic ingredients and my wifey made it at home recently. SOOOO good. This place is a solid choice for a tasty lunch. Go see them."}
{"text":"What a cap to an incredible weekend. A welcomed break from Vegas Strip food and our first real experience of off strip Vegas.  Darling customer service and most importantly...bomb arepas. And I don't tap into my 90s vocabulary often. It's just this is the only fair description. Your mouth and stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Very tasty and filling. before leaving vegas thast weekend I just needed one more for the road sadly they were closed on sunday.  but will definitley be back on my next vegas trip."}
{"text":"a meetup group met here for dinner one evening. It was pretty cool because we all tried different items and we shared them. I have never had this type of food before so I don't really know how to compare it. But I can say that we had fun we enjoy ourself and we tried lots of new foods."}
{"text":"For arepas (corn flour sandwiches), Viva Las Arepas is definitely one of the best places in town. I came here the third day it was open, when it was still called I Love Arepas and when signage wasn't as visible and impressive. I met Felix, the owner. He really prides himself on his recipe for his corn masa bread. He has the bread ready and preps everyday. He has trays of the bread and when you order, he heats up the bread for you right in front of you for you to see. What you might not know is that his back is aching just so you can see what he is doing because he set the grill up lower, so whenever he cooks, he really has to bend over and strain his neck for you to see how he's cooking everything in the trailer.  The trailer is where all the business and eating is done. His storage is right next to Dino's Neighborhood Bar. If you ever ask him, he might show you. His storage is filled with Corn Flour. His arepas are Venezuelan. Arepas are also really popular in Colombia. Anyway, he uses the freshest ingredients. His aguas (juices) are from concentrate and blended with filtered water. He has guanabana (soursop), guayaba (guava), parchita (passion fruit) and mango (mango, lol).   My favorite sandwich is the  Reina Pepiada: Fresh chicken with avocado cream sauce, great textures and came out piping hot, so it was really delicious.   I have tried many of the other sandwiches. They're all really delicious. The empanadas are filled with fresh meats. Their dessert, quesillo, was really delicious. Even though Felix doesn't like it being compared with a cheese flan, I felt that would be how I would describe quesillo to anyone.   This might look like a fast food joint to you, but he really takes the time to care about and cook his food. He enjoys telling people about the process of making his food. I enjoy listening to chefs talk about how they make their food.    I had a great experience all five times that I went to this place. I think that everybody in town should try to hit up this spot at least once. It's really a gem."}
{"text":"AREPAS OF ALL SORTS!  I don't believe I have ever tried Venezuelan food... but I was definately wanting to try this place for a while. Small corner place in a tiny little plaza on Las Vegas Blvd in the down town area. Booths on the sides of the restaraunt & tables in the center.   You order your food & then you pick up your food when they call your name. There are two different digital menus.. one in English & one in Spanish.  CARNE ASADA AREPAS $5.50 - comes w/ lettuce & tomato... we also added avocado for $0.99 more. The meat was very tender & the maize dough was soft yet grainy... it was definitely new for me but good. Reminds me of a tamale made differently. Ahhahaaa   CHICKEN EMPANADA $3 - hot & good like a chicken dumpling deed fried w/ dough shell rather than wonton shell  BEEF EMPANADA $3   GUAVA PASTELITOS $3 - this was like an empanada shaped differently & it was filled w/ guava chunks & cheese. Very interesting combination but it worked  COCONUT PASTELITOS $3 - wasn't too fond of this since I'm not a big fan of shredded coconuts that is used for desserts because it gets wayyy to fake kinda sweet taste, but this also had cheese in it so it wasn't toooo sweet."}
{"text":"Very good.  I enjoyed the passion fruit drink along with my areapa.  Shady are but that was a plus in my book.  Good value"}
{"text":"Everything here is great!  The arepas are amazing...especially with the spicy sauce or cilantro mayo which come in squirt bottles so you can add as much or as little as you'd like.  If you haven't had an arepa before... it's a small fried dough pocket stuffed with your favorite filling...and the filings here are spectacular!    My personal favorites are the pork or the shredded chicken with cilantro mayo.  So delicious!  The wood fired chicken is also amazing here. So much flavor in both the meat and the skin.  I like to have mine accompanied with fried yucca and plantains.    Stop by for a quick, delicious, cheap lunch!  Any time I'm north strip...viva las arepas is always a consideration!"}
{"text":"Simply great place to visit. Great food, really good prices, and fast service. The is always friendly. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This review is based on our very first visit to this delightful cafe as we hurried to grab a lunch before sitting for the afternoon at City Of The World Art Gallery on Casino Center Drive.  First, the staff are attentive, quick, and knowledgeable. The chef himself kept assuring us we were getting our food rapidly after we stepped away from the counter.  The place was hopping!!  I zeroed in on the wood fired chicken arepas. These are chunky big servings and very tasty! My husband got the ribs with black beans and rice- and he was quiet for a long time, chowing down with pleasure. The seasoning is great!  I, a plantain fanatic, only saw the plantains after I ordered. Next time, for we shall return!!!"}
{"text":"We love Viva on Las Vegas Boulevard and now we are so fortunate to live in between both locations!! We sat in and chowed down just now on the best Pabellon platter: shredded seasoned beef, black beans, rice and plantains, a half chicken with the greatest fries, and of course, as though I would starve ( no you cannot measure my midriff!! ) without take home food, we added enchiladas for tonight, and more plantains and flans. I think I have to just move next door. You get the same warm welcome and very helpful staff as you find on Las Vegas Boulevard, but a newer place and a great parking lot... You will love the people as much as the food!!!"}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend stopped in finally... he got the chicken arepa and empanada... he loved them! I got the beef arepa and fried plantains... we both got avocado and cheese on the arepas...  they tender, flaky, flavorful, and juciy. The cilantro sauce only enhanced the flavor. The staff were friendly and courteous. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Not the best area of town and not sure I'd want to go with the family after dark, but this place is a foodies dream! Everything is made fresh, the staff is super friendly and helpful (especially since I'd never tried Venezuelan food before). Prices are also very reasonable and portions are very filling."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a 4 star because I've tried better, but these arepas were really really good still."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!!!! What an amazing place. I am soooo thrilled to have found this on yelp and tried it! This is a must for anyone visiting Vegas PERIOD! I had the Reina Pepiada arepa.. and almost died!!! I also tried the pork, beef balck bean and cheese and they were all astonishingly good. I wanted to try it all. In the week that I was there I found this place the last couple of days before leaving and managed to go three more times! I also hadall  the pastelitos and my favorite was the cheese and coconut. Read the inspirational story behind the chef and owners story it was heart warming. PLUS you must go the the sister Gelatto store next door.. also break taking desserts!"}
{"text":"Food is ok although a little over-priced. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Ordered the two piece chicken and side. Think it was the smallest chicken ever. $6-7 for an arepa is highway robbery."}
{"text":"Viva Las Vegas? Nah, Viva Las Arepas!  A couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.    There are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious!   After reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily.   We were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the \"small\" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed.   To wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.  If you find a silly Asian girl chanting \"long live the arepa!\" here, that's me. If you find a female Asian bum on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming with a sign that says \"will work for arepas,\" that's me, too. That being said, you all get the point. Go get some arepas!"}
{"text":"Almost missed this place driving by, but found our way in.  There was a short wait which is always a good sign.  I had the shredded beef empenada and the chicken, avocado, mayo, cilantro arepa.  The portions appear to be small, but they fill you up!  I could barely finish both.  The food is delicious and definitely a menu that I want try all of.  The service is also quick and friendly.  Even though we ordered at the counter someone came to our table to make sure everything was ok.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"*BEST IN TOWN*  You want to do Vegas right? You come here. It's a local gem that's evolved from a food truck to a full on restaurant. Their meat is succulent and it's an authentic grub spot for South Americans and Latin food lovers.  Recommendations : Add cheese and avocado to any arepa. Their wood fire chicken is amazing. Have their soursop or maracuya (Passion fruit) juice.  Great spot for your hang over needs.  I LOVE AREPAS! VIVA LAS AREPAS!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch today and this is a Authentic Venezuela. Before I thinking is soso but when I test it. Omg it's nice and good for first time."}
{"text":"Arepas looks like larger English muffin slices, heavier than crunchy corn taco shell.  Filled with oozing tastiness.  I got the Reina Pepiada.  Look at the pic!  I didn't consume it right away since the empanada was easier to eat while driving.  Mistake - should never wait to eat it later cuz it tastes so much better hot and freshly made.  Kinda thinking Arepas would taste awesome with some beer!  First time to try arepas and I see why they want arepas to live long.  Or it could be cuz we're in Vegas and it rhymes with Viva Las Vegas!  Now pause... You hear Elvis singing?  But I wouldn't order the empanadas again.  I tasted a little sour in it like vinegar.  Could've been the filling... I dunno.  For sure would try another arepas."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.   So maybe this just isn't my kind of food but I wasn't crazy about this place.   It's REALLY CLEAN. And the employees were really friendly. But I didn't love the food.   I had the chicken and the shrimp arepas. I was not that impressed. It was just okay. I don't think I'll care enough to ever eat them again.   Not my favorite."}
{"text":"It's located in downtown. So when we first got there there was no customers. The place seems a little shady. But, we still went in and I am glad we did. The staff are friendly, the place is cleaned, they have the English menu on one side and Spanish menu on the other side. They have pictures of the food along the wall that help if you are a first timer. We ordered tons of food to tried. Tequeños is probably about 4-5 inches long. Pretty good size. It was very good. Arepas con carne mechada with cheese- the meat was very good and flavorful. Arepa con pollo with mayo and cilantro. Wow!!! That was fantastic. It's a must try. We also order cachapas too- very good. You will not go wrong with any of the item on the menu. Will definitely come back again if we are in Vegas.  The only thing is they don't have chicha- little disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here when they only had a little arepa stand.  I'm glad to see them expand to an actual sit down establishment.  Food and service is still excellent!!  I think the prices have been raised since the move, but it's so worth it.  About $5 per arepa.  I like the beef, chicken, pork, and chicken with avocado arepas.  Fried plantains are excellent, as well as their fresh juices.    Their hot sauce is killer!!!"}
{"text":"Only been once and we tried 2 arepas, the prices are around $6 and you may think you can eat more than one, but I couldn't. The arepas are made fresh to order and they don't skimp on cheese or meat. They don't seem that big, but believe me, you will leave very happy."}
{"text":"I have tried the #1 and #7 on different occasions and both times were great experiences. Also a must try is the fried plantains...delicious! Would definitely recommend to anyone to try."}
{"text":"All tho the place is on the corner of las Vegas blvd. It's worth standing outside. The food taste so fresh and service was excellent.  price for what u get is a steal !!"}
{"text":"Best Streaming twice. Friendly. Clean Not expensive. Will come back for more Quality food"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly clean and comfortable. I got a wood-fired shredded chicken Arepa with just cheese, and they give you a spicy green salsa and creamy cilantro sauce on the side complimentary! The ground maize which serves as the \"bread\" has great texture and was incredibly filling, and the the chicken was so juicy and smokey. The fried plantains were rich and mildly sweet. If you're looking for something off the beaten path of tacos and burritos, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price.  Nothing special, but a great find for Vegas fare. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Reina Pepiada Aerepa and the Asada Arepa, the ingridients are fresh, the staff is friendly, I would definetly visit them again next time I'm in vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing arepas! Vegetarian, shrimp and pabellon arepas were delicious. Empanadas are delicious. Staff is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Clean, service is great, very friendly staff, great for lunch. Oh! Food is amazing.  Fries crunchy. Fountains drinks and juice."}
{"text":"Let's talk about this. Do order an arepa. I recommend the vegetarian one with beans and avocado but that's just cuz I'm a vegetarian. Get cheese in it. Consider putting a damn egg in it. Do use all of the light green sauce they give you and maybe the dark green hotter one. This is all excellent. Excellent. But don't bother with getting the sides.  Stop rethinking this and just follow the directions I already gave you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food , prices and service. So much to choose from so the guy told us a little bit about the menu and gave us some suggestions.  Excellent is an understatement"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place, it's super good and the staff is very friendly! The Reina Pepiada is my fav!"}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here regularly. My favorite items are the #12 Pabellon Arepa - the plantain makes it amazing. The #13 Cachapa - this is like a quesadilla made with a pancake. And both Guava/cheese and Coconut/cheese Pastelitos. These are like gourmet poptarts. The passion fruit juice is also very good way to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Great little place just north of the Stratosphere. All the arepas are good. I personally like the Reina Pepiada and the Garlic Shrimp. My wife and daughter always stick with the Black Beans and Rice and get a cheese empanada. Don't go for the ambience as you are sitting on the strip right across from OC - a gentleman's club. The area can seem sketchy but the food is cheap, tasty and a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Alright, driving down the strip wondering what's a good place to grab a small bite to eat, to my best ability as a yelper- it lead me here... this place wasnt hard to fine.. On corner of Oakley*  The restaurant is big and tons of space to sit.. Wasnt busy when I came through.  I order the woods-fire chicken arepas with cheese and avocado and a side of fried yucca root and pork.  First time trying arepas but it tasted like tomale due to the fact they used corn as the bread... And came with shredded chicken.   Overall I was satisfied with the arepas but Its a bit pricy for just this.. 4.99 for a small bite with no side.  The yucca root and pork was good but hey fried yucca root taste like fries with a bit texture difference, and the fried pork was flavorful.  This is a good place to stop by for a small bite :D some come try it out :D"}
{"text":"I have recently become an arepas fan. Only in the last year have even discovered them and since then I am on the look out for them when I travel. We came across this restaurant by chance searching for food on google. It's a little hole in the was with a relaxed and open atmosphere. People come in relaxed and leave happy. I ordered El Pabellion and Reina Pepida. Both were absolutely amazing! They also had fresh strawberry juice. This place is so good. I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It deserves a 4.5 because the parking lot sucks and the seating isn't so comfy. BUT OH THE AREPAS. I'm sorry I'm shouty in all caps but seriously, I'm from the east coast and I can't get arepas like this. I loved them and they were exactly like what I'd eaten when I lived in Venezuela. I wish they had an arepas place around here. I would destroy it on a daily basis. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic sandwich. From the loads of meat inside to the potato shelling of the arepa, I was in a great place while eating. Both the chicken and beef were great but that beef was something else and had a full on sandwich feel with the inclusion of tomato and lettuce to make sure you fill up. I had two sandwiches which in hindsight is a lot because you really need 1 and a side or 1.5 for a nice meal, but I was just in a zone with the taste and couldn't stop. They have a few sauces to add on which could have been spicier but overall good selection of juices to add on. I would say service is a little slow as I went during an off hour and still had a 15 minute wait. Also, $5 might be a $1 high for this size of a sandwich but I'm willing to pay for quality. Just get 2 and a side and a you're set for the next couple days. Great choice if in the area and looking for a unique meal."}
{"text":"What a treat to have authentic Venezuelan arepas five minutes drive from north strip (Encore/Wynn).  Reina pepiada all day, everyday if it were near me. My husband and I are usually happy to split our dishes so we can try more things, but this one was not easy to give up half (wait you took the last bite already?!). The saucy chicken avocado cilantro mixture is oh so refreshing for a hot summer day. I would award the pork butt a distant second place, it was a good one to start with, I like to end with my favorite flavors :)   For the arepa newbie, just because they look small doesn't mean they aren't super filling... 2 is sufficient for a hungry person, 2.5 if you're slightly hungrier, and 3 you are willing to sacrifice stomach comfort for the experience of more flavors. Nom."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to grab a quick bite. The arepas are very flavorful and there are many varieties to choose from. If you're ever near hear do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time eating here in 3 days! Found this place under Gluten-free on yelp and had to give it a try. Their food is delicious and CHEAP! I've tried a few different items on the menu and always left satisfied. For breakfast, I ordered the vegetarian arepa with scrambled eggs. Ooh my, now that was a yummy meal! You can't go wrong eating here. Everything is fresh and flavorful.  Their fruity drinks are the best, they are so fresh, you can taste the pureness. This is definitely going to be a place I eat at every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The location is interesting. Very much downtown Las Vegas, in a strip mall, with somewhat sketchy looking surroundings, but plenty of well lit parking in front. The interior was very clean and they even have a bilingual menu with a wide assortment of options beyond just arepas.   The portions are large. Even with a healthy appetite I was only able to eat one of the two arepas I ordered. The bean and cheese arepa was delicious, but just a little on the bland side of flavor. The shredded beef arepa was more flavorful. They have a spicy green mole sauce and a tangy cilantro sauce which are served with your food, if you enjoy more flavor.  The service itself was attentive, well thought out, friendly and helpful.   All in all a good spot for great food, great service and an interesting experience. I would definitely recommend Viva Las Arepas to anyone who enjoys Latin flavors or more specifically, authentic Venezuelan cuisine."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Fresh ingredients and the prices are totally affordable! My husband and I initially tried to share an arepas (wood fired chicken) and an empanada (black bean & cheese)... We had to go back for seconds! Sooooo good! And their mango juice is super tasty too :)"}
{"text":"Vegas goes Venezuelan.  These arepas and empanadas are the hottest things to come out of Venezuela since their women! While they lack a sultry accent and their physical appearance isn't as stunning, these bites are just as alluring as any Venezuelan vixen.  In pursuit of another worthy eating destination away from The Strip, I learned of Viva Las Arepas from a local. It is on S. Las Vegas Blvd at Oakey just north of The Stratosphere. Before they were here, they operated out of a food stand.  The shredded chicken empanada ($2.75) was warm and crispy. After taking the first bite to expose the inside, I recommend throwing some of their green sauce into that bad boy to kick up the spice.   My garlic shrimp arepa ($7) was piping hot (in temperature) so I had to wait for it to cool down. It was moist and slightly started falling apart on me as I ate it. They stuff it with plenty of juicy shrimp so it was satisfying despite the challenge of taking it in. All other arepas cost less than the shrimp one. The shredded beef/Mechada ($6) is often my go to arepa.  You can bet I'll be back to get some nice Venezuelan ass too (or \"pork butt\" as it's called on their menu).  This area isn't particularly desirable or Vegasy but I'll take some arepas and empanadas over uninspiring overpriced Strip food any day. For those that are on a mission to find quality authentic food, and couldn't care less about glitz and glamour, this is your place!   Plus, the highly acclaimed Art of Flavors (gelato) is right next door (update/edit: it really isn't anymore as the Chef now works at Gelatology)."}
{"text":"OMG new spot to get some delicious Venezuelan arepas!  I have never had one before so I really can't compare arepa to arepa, but these little guys are so delicious for about $5 a pop!  Cheap delicious eats!  So happy that Anne L. introduced me to this place.  Here is what we tried: 1. Reina peplada: the most popular.  Chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  Served cold.  What is not to love??? 2. Pork butt: it is delicious with cheese added!  Soft pork, sorta like a pulled pork sandwich. 3. Woodfire beef: with tomato, lettuce, and onion.  Tender beef with all the veggies. 4. Garlic shrimp: fully loaded and can be served hot or cold.  5. Fried yucca and pork rinds: this was surprisingly delicious!  I was scared about eating pork rinds but they went well with the yucca!  It's like interesting fries :)  Some other notes: - bad area but nice restaurant. - right across the street from Luv-It's Frozen Custard! - the sauces are amazing - the bread is toasted and yummy  Can't wait to come back and eat everything here.  Haha."}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan fare. I say that with pride because I am Venezuelan and this food is just as close as it gets.   I love it all, there isn't one dish i don't like and i am sure you will agree. The food  however is a bit heavy and very filling, ordera few things to share.   Cachapa con queso or pabellon (corn pancake with cheese or pabellon style) Deliciously sweet and salty, moist and just made to order.  The empanadas are excellent too, deep fried and full of flavor. Get any of the meats with this.  The arepas are great too, our staple. The masa is thin and generously filled with the works. I like it with pabellon as well because that style has cheese, plantains, shredded beef and not too much of black beans cooked to a mush.   You can also get a side of fried plantains (sweet and browned). And the green sauces? put that $#!t on everything!  I had a passion fruit juice (parchita) which was just okay. You can't expect them to get the real fruit there, in the middle of the desert!I would go with a soda or malta. Or keep it light with some water, free.   Nothing in this place will let you down. This is Latino Food that not everybody gets to try but should.   Cheap, easy parking, fast service. A good break from the strip food."}
{"text":"Ordered: Fried plantains, pork butt arepa, ham&egg arepa, beef empanada and mango juice  Amazing  Best quick breakfast in vegas"}
{"text":"This is such a great find!  Never have had Venezuelan food but simply amazing, simple and fresh. Neighborhood was questionable but inside is clean, cute and fast. I've had the arepes and empanadas only. Can't seem to order anything else Cuz I am hooked.   Salsa too hot for me but garlic sauce is so good on everything.  I get my lunch to go...but they have cute patio area if you are not in a rush."}
{"text":"I was excited about having fresh Christmas Venezuelan Hallacas instead I received some frozen garbage that looked like they came from the bottom of the freezer from two years ago! I'm going to enclose a pictures and I can tell you that the taste was terrible they all fell apart when you opened them and they didn't taste good! Don't throw your money away at this overpriced low-quality restaurant. They don't use gloves either everything is touched by their bare hands dirty establishment."}
{"text":"What a great introduction to Venezuelan food, outstandingly friendly cashier and delicious and reasonably priced.  The Arepa is their specialty. To me it was sort of the ingredients of a gourmet tamale in different proportions turned into a sandwich. Basically they make a  corn tortilla about 1/4\" thick, grill it up, then add your choice of several delicious fillings. They give a couple of types of sauces that can be used with it, they also are outstanding: a pepper sauce and a creamy muted garlic sauce. And the cutie at the counter also implored us to get the yucca fries, and holy moley was she spot on- they blew us away.  And they're open until midnight and have easy parking right in front, steps away. Had our meal in my hands within 5 minutes.  I'm gonna be seeking out more Venezuelan food in my life, this was hands down some of the best \"fast food\" I've ever had.   Thanks, viva las Apepas!!"}
{"text":"I guess you already know - this place has some delicious food.  I eat these arepas on an annual basis - and it's consistently awesome, even through the transition from the tiny walk-up stand/shack to its new restaurant location (on the next block over). I had never been to the physical location before, and decided to check it out this time. My friend and I got to the restaurant at like 11:58PM and they close at midnight (oops), but Felix welcomed us warmly and insisted we eat there as opposed to getting it to-go. We both wanted the reina pepiada arepa, but they only had enough for one so he gave us an extra beef arepa and the cachapas for FREE! After I ordered I asked what a 'pastelito' was, and when our food came out, he brought out an order of the guava pastelitos...for FREE. That man is so dang NICE.  -Wood-fire beef arepa ($5): Really good meat - I like the shredded beef better, but this wood-fire technique is apparently new? Good savory flavor but I personally like the shredded texture better - less meat falls out with each bite. -Reina pepiada arepa ($5): I normally dislike mayonnaise, but this is sooo good. The chicken+cilantro+flavors+avocado are like the best chicken salad you've ever had. -Cachapas ($5): Never had this before, we loved it! thick gooey cheese between SWEET corn pancake thingies. They weren't tortillas - more like thin cornmeal pancakes, and were sweet. Sweet and sorta salty from the cheese. So. Good. -Guava and cheese pastelito ($2): Reminded me of wontons but filled with guava jam and chunks of chewy cheese. Again great flavor - sweet from the guava but savory from the dough and cheese.  Everyone working there was so nice - we definitely were the last people in the dining room, and they didn't rush us at all even though Felix told us when we left he had to be back there at 7:30 the next morning! I felt so bad but the overall experience was seriously awesome. This is for sure on my list anytime I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot.  #7 arepa (Reina Pepiada) is great!"}
{"text":"Sooo good!  We stopped by on our way to fremont street from the strip. It was almost empty at the time (9:30 pm ish) but the place seemed clean and well kept. The lady that rang us up was super friendly and patient with us as we were not too familiar with the menu.  I got the carne asada and jamon y queso (ham & cheese) arepas with a guava and cheese pastelito for dessert and the passionfruit drink.  First off, these arepas are HUGE. I eat a lot, and 1 1/2 of these bad boys sure filled me up.  They're not skimpy on the fillings at all. It may not look like it at first glance, but these arepas are STUFFED to the brim. The carne asada was seasoned well, and there was this melty, gooey cheese literally spilling out of my ham and cheese arepa. My boyfriend gave me a bite of his Reina Pepiada and I really digged the avocado and cilantro sauce that it was cooked in.  I was a bit confused on the guava and cheese pastelito as they put a piece of actual cheese (think of almost like a squeaky mozarella cheese curd) needless to say, I was expecting cream cheese like they serve in Miami. But I'm familiar with cheese being dessert so it was interesting.  Whenever Im back in Vegas I will make sure to come back, so happy to have stumbled on this place!"}
{"text":"Let me say it in simple terms...it's so tasty!!!!   If you're in Vegas this is a must try.   The Arepas are so delicious."}
{"text":"ZOMG.  After my friend (who also works as a chef in the Comme Ca in vegas) told me to come here, I decided to give this place a try after one drunken night of drinking a bit too much of Mrs.Belvedere (Grey goose ftw).    Buy anywayz, I was DEFINITELY blown out of the sky with their Shredded Beef arepa.  It was f'in money (substitude \"f\" for watever you want).  Although I've never had an arepa, I DO know what good food is all about.  This place just hits a sweet spot that's so sweet, that your sweetness will die of being sweet.  I would never imagine myself giving a little food stand 5 stars, but I have no choice.    If you are looking for some drunk food in vegas, look no further.  In fact, you don't even have to be drunk to enjoy this place.  Just come here and enjoy a fantastic Venezuelan arepa.  Oh, and I also had the chance to take a bite of the empanada...fried to perfection.  For hangover pre-medication, try the sugar cane juice with lime.  For $1.50, you can't go wrong.  I was a little confused on how to get here (drunk, but I wasn't driving fyi), but coming from Las Vegas Blvd, head past the Stratosphere and stay on your right as you come to a fork.  You'll see it a block ahead.  This place closed at 12am."}
{"text":"I loved the arepas! Local friends brought us here as we passed through on our way to California. Got the pork arepas and half a grilled chicken. Came with beans and rice and all was plenty for the two of us. Would come again for sure."}
{"text":"The best Venezuelan food I have ever had in 27 years on earth. I have been to Phoenix, Portland Michigan and California and nothing comes close. Not even a light year close. The sauce they give out is the best with the food. Just go there and try something and everything. It is in one of my favorite eateries to go to in Vegas. I only have a few."}
{"text":"Hands down freakin' awesome once you find it! The address given on Yelp doesn't take you anywhere near this place.   I lucked out and found a parking spot right out front. I was greeted upon entering and was quickly and easily able to make a selection. My go-to arepa is pork with cheese and avacado. The ones they serve up here do not dissapoint. I splurged and ordred plaintains, which we perfectly fried. Arepa, plaintains anddrink were around $12!   I could never go to Vegas and dine in a fancy schmancy restaurant knowing places like Viva Las Arepas exist! I would recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"You guys food is bad your meat is bad and you got 2 of my family members wrong. You are crazy your nut. you guys are your food is way worse than raw eggs.  Food was bad but service was so terrible I'd rather let me 9 year old write a review he thought it was bad   Where to start we love the other location  They got our order wrong in so many ways  Called in a pick up and didn't start till we got there so I knew it was going to take a while so I asked the bald head guy that said he was the owner to put on the game and he said ok, just give me a sec. Ok....to go meal completely wrong sides  RAW chicken in my sons dish Completely wrong arepa got beef when my girl ordered chicken  Mind you the restaurant was slow the bald head owner still didn't put on the game   After waiting 25 minutes getting home to over less than mediocre food we called to get resolved just to be hung up on"}
{"text":"Luckily, our family lives in the area near this place so we get it fairly regularly.  Had no clue what an arepa was before coming here but now I'm hooked.  My wife and I just need an excuse.  Highly recommend swinging by the gelato shop next door for desert as well.  Awesome stuff."}
{"text":"The reina pepiada arepa was amazing!  Great creamy garlicky chicken salad.  The arepa was warm and crispy!  The service was great and friendly and attentive.  My only criticism is no fountain soda.  Not a deal breaker but worth a mention."}
{"text":"I've tried this when it was still the stand outside and it was awesome. Decided to try this before going to Art of Flavors on a date night around town (Dinner and Dessert in the same lot! WINNER!). Upon going in I noticed it was a different menu. A bit of a bummer, but oh well. The guy behind to counter was very nice and helpful. He confirmed that they did indeed change the menu to give it a new feel. He also helped us out by telling us what was the most popular orders. We ended up just getting the pork butt arepa because we were a bit full. All I can say is they still got it! Still fresh, flavorful, and just delicious. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"WOW! I've had arepas a few times elsewhere, but the arepas here are massive and stuffed full of goodies!  There are a ton of arepas to choose from, and they are very filling plus not too expensive. I usually need two arepas or one arepa and a side to feel full, but I eat a lot. They have some grilled items if you are not feeling arepas, and various sides/beverages as well.   Place your order at the counter and give your name, and your name will be called for pickup when ready. Service is good but minimal, as this is a fast casual dining establishment.   There are a good number of seats inside, but the parking lot is not that big.   It's a simple looking eatery serving up some unique and tasty food!"}
{"text":"Came here today and the owner was so nice. He replaced my drink with a different one for free when I didn't like the taste. I ordered a cuchapa and it was the most unique thing I've had all year. What a wonderful place"}
{"text":"Great place the cheese empanadas are the best of the best also the staff is friendly, they definitely have a loyal customer here thank you VIVA LAS AREPAS"}
{"text":"The best arepas in town! Try the pork butt or the reina pepiada, and make sure you order  the mango water to go with it. The employees are super friendly too"}
{"text":"This is gluten free heaven! My friend introduced me to this place and I am always hesitant to try new foods when I am unfamiliar with the ingredients and when there is a possibility there could be a translation problem that I need to be wheat free! I checked out the menu online and saw I could order a plate, then I noticed gluten free on the website and I cheered, I can eat a sandwich!  I ordered the wood fired beef, plantains and the lime with cane sugar drink and it was absolutely delicious! They give you sauces to add to the sandwiches that was fabulous, the plantains were yummy as well as the drink it went perfect together. I look forward to trying the other meats they offer.  There is a patio outside however there are no misters so it could be a little warm during the day but for a summer night it will work! That area of the Strip is a little dicey but it is part of the charm!"}
{"text":"While I was enjoying my lunch in this establishment, my purse tipped over and dumped several of my credit cards under the table. I didn't realize this until many hours later, and I called around to the places I had been hoping they had been turned in. I was delighted to discover that they had been found, and put in a safe place. The manager even called American Express and asked them to notify me that they had my cards.   So, the area is sketchy, but the staff here is honest and goes above and beyond to provide excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I've realized there's two ways you can give stars, you can give it based on how much you like it, or based on how good it is at what it's supposed to be. This for starts is the latter.  I've never had arepas before, but it's a weird mix between a taco and slider inside of a crumbly white corn bun. The bun to me is what really separates it from anything else. It's like cornbread, texture wise with not much taste. Wasn't exactly my favorite part of the meal. It did have a good crunch from them coming on the griddle though.   The filing is very similar to tacos. We got the wood fire beef (#1) which is like diced beef, pork belly (#4?), and chicken (#7). The best was the beef. The pork belly reminded me of frozen pre made pulled pork with heavy sauce. The chicken was way too over sauced and the sauce was just creamy, no flavor.  The food also came with two sauce, a spicy sauce, and the same sauce they used with the chicken arepa. The spicy sauce was very forgettable, hardly any spice. The cream sauce way actually decent and tasted better in smaller doses then flooded with chicken.   Overall this was not my favorite experience, but I realize it maybe more sure to my taste buds than anything they did."}
{"text":"Que sabrosas la arepas!I stopped in right after they closed but were kind enough to make me some arepas to go. So delicious and fresh ingredients. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"First time here today & I for sure know it won't be my last! I had the #7(forgot the name) but it was delicious. I also had a bean & cheese empanada. The food was very flavorful. Nothing overpowering and all the different ingredients complimented each other in this amazing meal. The passion fruit drink is great as well.  Definitely will recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I had tried the chicken & spinach arepas, also the beef & it was so yummy!! The only con was the arepa itself is hard, I'm not sure if it was left out too long or just a bad batch but the fillings are so good & on point! The size is perfect for a snack or just a small bite to get you going. Their prices are not bad either! Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Venezuelan food! Get #1, #7 (get the shrimp hot), and coconut or guava empanadas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! I got three Arepo's the wood fired beef, the chicken, & the pulled pork. All three were magnificent! Each tasted completely different. Each sandwich is also gluten free. What really stood out was how incredible and fresh everything was. It was as if someone 's grandma had worked her magic to make everything so perfect. Each sandwich, or Arepo's cost $5. The shredded beef empanada was $3 and the dough was so fresh. The beef was moist and delicious. I had a hard time sharing. They also had a really interesting drink menu with passion fruit , coconut water, and soursop. If you are in Vegas , this place cannot be missed. Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped to eat here after seeing so many reviews and stars. The food came and it was raw beef. The pictures are all zoomed in to make it look like its Huge. What a disappointing experience. And it was expensive."}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas is great! Deliciousness, a great value and friendly service... can you go wrong?  They have lots of options for carnivores, herbivores, omnivores and everyone in between. The garlic shrimp is yummy and so is my basic stand-by, beans and cheese (with added avocado!). For side dishes, their fries are deliciously crisp and their fried plantains are awesome as well.  On our last visit I tried the cachapa for the first time, which was like a really yummy, salty-sweet, corn and cheese pancake or crepe. I am kind of craving one right now.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I once found a hair in my reina pepiada arepa, and that was gross. But everything else has been great and we have brought visitors here with great success. Viva las arepas!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite in town. The best place for some awesome food. Awesome service and definitely a must visit in town."}
{"text":"I've always drove pass this place whenever I'm down at the culinary pharmacy, but never thought to actually stop by and try it. I mean I've had Arepas before, but that was in Denver, at a food truck festival. So obviously they were bigger and expensive. So I finally gave in and told my bf and parents that we should go have lunch there. So we did!  We ordered 2 wood fire beef with cheese, 2 shredded beef with cheese, 1 order of fried plantains, 2 orders of cheese empanadas, a passion fruit juice and a pineapple juice. THEY WERE AMAZEBALLS!!!! Everything came out hot and fresh. They weren't as big as I thought they would be though, so it's definitely an awesome spot to have an afternoon bite!   Customer service is awesome and the place is clean! I was so glad we made it in literally 5mins before the lunch rush.  I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic arepas y empanadas. Would come back to Vegas for this place in a heart beat. We had a cachapa, arepas de pabellon, and the empanadas de carne, queso, y pollo. The prices were great and service was great as well. After we ate we got a second round to go. I came with a Venezuelan friend and she says--- una de las mejores arepas que me he comido fuera de Venezuela. Muy buena sazón, el queso riquísimo y la carne divina!! Súper recomendado este lugar!"}
{"text":"I finally found a place with some culture and charm. It has that thing that's missing in Vegas; a place you can go to get one thing made very well. Viva Las Arepas is inexpensive, super delicious, and something you will crave once you try it."}
{"text":"Sooo happy I got to take the hubby to the place that introduced me to arepas years ago. Back then I'm pretty sure it was just a food truck or atleast they had a food truck cuz I remember I got it from one.  In anycase I am thrilled to return 6 years later to find they are not only still up and running but thriving!  There was literally a steady line the entire time we waited. From door to counter.  And this was 11:30 on a random Tuesday! We got the pernil arepa and added avocado. Perfection isn't even a good enuf word frankly!  Seriously if you aren't eating here you are missing out BIG TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad...  LOCATION: Does not appear to be the safest location (fyi), but it is closest conveniently close to the strip. A block or two away from the Stratosphere and also behind a neighbor filled with hipsters and retirees. It's cultured to say the least. Depending on when you go, the parking lot is not to spacious and there's always ongoing traffic... just be careful.  VENUE: Stands out with its bright yellow interior. It makes me feel mellow and happy to be inside &good memories every time I drive past. There's also Venezuelan gelato shop right next door which its it feel very authentic. Along with the yellow, the photos of the menu all around and make my mouth watery as I try to figure out what to order. Music is welcoming and the bathroom is clean and might I add, cozy. Find out for yourself, lol.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Very accommodating, always friendly as well as fast.  FOOD: There are two sauces you have to try! I always get my garlic shrimp arepa along with an empanada or two.... along with some fries and rice if I'm really hungry. The first time I came with my vegan friend and she devoured as much as I did on her own terms, so I'd always like to think this place is vegan-friendly. I'm never disappointed with my order because the food is always consistent and more than anything else, delicious!  OVERALL: I've recommended this place numerous times to people. I've tried an arepa from a food truck and nothing compares to VIVA LAS AREPAS! I've been in love with this place since it was a small food stand and if you're craving something that you fill you up with warmth and carbs. THIS IS IT!"}
{"text":"Trusting my friends judgement was once again a great thing. I had the carne asada arepa and cheese empanada, with a side of great service, a funny spanish lesson, and the delicious armor of meat cooked over wood-fire. Mouth-watering!   Delicious, and well worth the drive away from the Strip.   And the price of the food can't be beat."}
{"text":"OMG, my significant other has been keeping this place from me.  I love the No. 7 Reina Papaida but everything we tried was fabulous.  Felix is very friendly and the staff always happy to explain the menu items.  I don't know how they make their Arepas but they are soooo good.  I have now been about 4 times in just a month or so.  The price is great too, only 4-5 dollars for one arepas.  The first time I went I ordered what turned out to be a feast but now I know better and keep it simple 1 arepas, and an empanada."}
{"text":"MMmmmm!! Arepas! I would say these things are crossed between a tamale and a pita bread all in one.  But, much better than a tamale.. I usually don't like corn based stuff like corn tortillas, but these are the exception.  I always get the pork butt with cheese. It is a little salty but very tasty.  The light green sauce will balance out the saltiness though.  I am obsessed with that sauce by the way.  I believe it is cilantro based? I have yet to try the other kinds they offer.  On to the place... the place is located in a dingy area of Las Vegas.  Parking can be tricky as it is limited and awkward.  It is located in a triangular intersection off of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd.  However, once inside, the place is pleasant and clean and the employees are very friendly.  It seemed like they just upgraded their menu displays to flat screens.  I like how they have it in Spanish and English.  Anyways, I would say get your butt over there and try the pork butt!!!!  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch. The wood fire chicken plate with salad and beans always hits the spot for me. The arepas are great too. I come here at least 4 times a week"}
{"text":"Straight up legit Best arepas, literally make excuses to come to Vegas just for them. Can't go wrong with a Reina pepiada. Staff is friendly and place is clean. Stop what you are doing and go. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"This is a great place or friends took us too. The food is authentic and delicious. I highly suggest trying the yuca fries and both the tostones and a sweet plantains. They staff was very helpful and didn't mind us bringing our own beer. This is one place you want to try is your in town and our visiting."}
{"text":"Yes! I finally made it here. I had it book marked for the longest time and was reluctant to come to downtown. Anyways, found a spot to park at the back side of the building. They have outdoor seatings as well but the area at night creeps me out a little bit, LOL!  The food is very unique, and it's important to point out I learned that this restaurant is gluten free. I love the simplicity of ingredients focused on quality.   Imo, the meat is special because they are cooked with a traditional grill using wood which is a layer of flavor that is very distinct.  I ordered some take out: Asada Arepas, Empanada with beans & cheese and for deserts-Guava and cheese Pastelito.  Each arepa on the menu is only around $5-7 depending on what's inside it. You can add extra toppings like cheese, avocado, fried egg for .50 - $1.00.   The sauces were also excellent, not too salty, watery or too thick.  The lady at the cashier was very friendly and gave me suggestions on what to order.  Very reasonably priced, will be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Go off the beaten path and visit Las Arepas on your next Vegas trip. It's not on the strip, but rather in between the convention center and downtown. Totally worth a stop on your way to night out downtown! Arepas were perfection! The shredded beef is a must try. The service was absolutely fabulous, too. The owner, Felix, went above and beyond and made a very nice impression on us."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The staff was very curteous and helpful :)...they do not offer military discount however the owner granted the 10%off my entire purchase which was not just for myself but my family as well...im definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Arepas I have everrrrrr had!!! If you are in the area, you should definitelyyyyyy check out this cute little place!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Sort of a let down for me - especially since arepas are my new found love. I think we got the reina pepiada arepa - the filling was good but the flat bread was sort of dry and lacks the soft chewey texture I prefer. It's not as good as the arepas I can get here in OC at Mil Jugos."}
{"text":"I've seen their other location on Las Vegas Blvd but have never had the opportunity to visit that location. This location is nestled in a quiet corner. I'm glad I stumbled upon this location because their food is really good. The staff is incredibly friendly, I told the woman who helped me that this was my first time here and she offered me a sample of the shredded beef (which is incredibly tender and flavorful). I took the suggestion of the woman who offered me the sample. I ordered the Arepas #12, it's pretty good. I misunderstood her description of it and thought the plantains came on the side but instead they're layered on the bun. If I could order again, I'd probably go with the Plato Pabellon which has all of the items separated from each other. I do like this arepas and would definitely order it again. The meat is tender, the plantains add a little bit of sweetness and the black beans fill you up. There's just the perfect amount of all the ingredients. Make sure you try their green chili and cremè sauce...it's so good!!"}
{"text":"Bomb as hell!!!!!! So good I want to marry the yucca fries, the arepas... and so much more."}
{"text":"My friend located this restaurant on Yelp while we  were spending a week in Vegas for Rollercon. Really wish we had found this place earlier in the week. Bright and clean establishment with an easy to read menu.  Very pleasantly surprised.  I had the bean and avocado arepa.  Loved the homemade corn \"bread\" that filling was held between.  Really liked the two sauces that were served with the arepas.  One was like a watery ranch dressing and the other a watery avocado dressing.  Watery only describes the consistency.  Both dressings had a nice light flavor to them.  After eating I decided I wanted something  more and had one of their mango drinks which was quite refreshing and not too sweet."}
{"text":"We were staying at SLS for work and decided we needed to branch out and see what Vegas offered. Our first stop was Viva las Arepas where the signature arepas are available in a variety of flavor combinations. We loved what we ordered and returned several times during our stay."}
{"text":"I don't care if you don't know what Venezuelan food is. This place has amazing arepas. Don't know what an arepa is? Find out here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and first time trying \"authentic Venezuelan\" food. I really liked it. I got a arepas reina pepiada (chicken breast, avocado and cilantro). They smoke their meat with hickory chips and you can taste it.  I say give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Good arepas especially for all the mexican chefs. Usually my paisano chefs cook other latino food like mexican food but here they do a good job preserving the Venezuelan style :) I love that they have a shrimp arepa, not even in Miami do they have that :)  Todo es rico aquí. Me encanta que tengan una arepa de camarón. Me puedo comer como 5 de esas jaja. Proxima ida a las vegas de seguro regresare."}
{"text":"what a little gem of a place! I stopped there after shopping at the outlets for a late lunch. We had the Roasted Pork Butt, the Garlic Shrimp and a shredded beef empanada. The pork was mouth watering and full of flavor. My favorite was the garlic shrimp. Plenty of shrimp and garlic flavors bursting in your mouth! Can't wait to hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"Oh arepas!!! I do love thee!!! Warning, if you are on a diet that requires you to neglect the decadent foods in life.. Don't come here, unless you want to be a rebel. I like rebels!!!  I had been here in the past, so I'm very well acquainted with the reina pipiada  arepa (stuffed with chicken salad avocado mix) which is one of my favorites, chicharron arepa, and steak arepa.. All favorites. I wanted something different, so I opted for the smoked pork ribs with a side of rice and beans and a cachapa. Oh lord.. Here it goes!  Smoked pork ribs- so tender it fell off the bones. The flavor was robust and a touch smokey, but not overwhelming. Just plain delicious. Black beans- almost tasted like chili beans... I ate them all. Rice- was yummy and like that it's mixed with corn and peas. Cachapa- I can eat these all day everyday. It's a sweet and savory corn pancake stuffed with ooey gooey mozzarella cheese. This dish alone will ruin any plans of obtaining that coveted 6pack. Stay away for it is HIGHLY addictive.   I fell in love with the food, but most importantly, with the friendly staff. They were also quite perceptive because as our server was ready to deliver the food, he noticed the table was wobbly, so he immediately bent down to adjust it. He came by a few times to check on us and made sure we were completely satisfied. I sure was.   Viva las arepas is a no brainer, and I will most certainly return until I have conquered every dish they have. Thank god pool season is over."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(149/365) \"How About a Pabellon Cachapa?\"  Long awaited update, and first time in the brick and mortar location. Glad to see that they offer more than just Arepas now, and are open 24 hours on weekends.  Perusing the menu, a couple of things caught my attention-Pabellon, and Cachapa. Too bad they didn't have the two combined, because I've been searching for that killer combination after having it at Pica Pica Maize Kitchen in Napa. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-napa-2?select=D2QDnqVaFYS7EpRd-4XTqQ#Eo2CTtCtgsNwu0ZAaFIeiQ  Having already tried a few of the Arepas, we ordered both the Cachapa and Pabellon to share as well as their tasty Soursop Drink. These were both pretty good, but I wished they would offer more ways to have the cachapa than just cheese.fillings, or even a pabellon cachapa? (hint, hint!) maybe like any of the arepas  The Arepas are okay, but I just am not much of a fan of that masa pocket that holds all the fillings together, kinda like a Mexican Gordita which I'm also not really a fan of.  If worse comes to worse, I might even just order a cachapa and ask them to add the meat and plantains inside and charge me extra...that is, if and when a craving hits, because we're almost always next door anyway!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \u  3.25"}
{"text":"one word: AMAZING! .......OK But I have to tell you why its amazing:   -Time: everything seems to be made to order! so it takes a little patience and its well worth it, I cant emphasize enough \"its well Worth the wait\" they are fast in overall, everything is fresh FRESH...F R E S H !!!! like home made cooking from remote places....  -TASTE: wow where do I start! this \"Arepas\" are like a small thick pita bread but made with corn and are delicious on their own, they slice them on the edge and stuff them with a shredded CHICKEN mix....that was great, I also had the ROASTED PORK BUTT, also freshly made, I had the REINA PEPIADA (chicken salad style) a bit too much mayo for my taste but never the less they are tasty, I also had the TONGUE and the TRIPE and my favorite was the EMPANADA also made with corn and extremely delicious made fresh stuffed with just enough beans and cheese for taste......My least favorite was the ALLACAS, which resemble a OaxacanTamale from southern Mexico wrapped in a banana leaf stuffed with chicken with green olives raisins and spices, the dough part of the ALLACA was soft and it melted in your mouth....my friends loved it.  -TO DRINK: They have REAL R E A L \"RRREEEEAAALLLL\"!!!! (comprende?) real juice of MANGO or TAMARIND or SUGARCANE or GUAVA or GUANABANA.....they were all excellent, thirst quenchers ....and yes I tried all of this in the same visit......it is simply good.   -CLEANLINESS: Well its a little 10x20 kitchen with tables on the parking lot....I took a peak inside the kitchen from several angles and its clean, almost as if it was new, people that work around that area kept coming and going for to go orders, the parking is old but clean.   -THE RUNDOWN: Just go, eat and behold grandmas cooking! and if you never had a grandma just adopt the cooks.  simply good food."}
{"text":"First time trying this place will definitely be back!!  Loved the wood fired chicken arepa!!  So tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Este lugar es buenisimoooo tengo varios días aquí en Las Vegas y he venido casi todos los días les recomiendo todas sus comidas tienes buena sazón.... 5 estrellas para ellos, lo mejor de todo tiene wifi"}
{"text":"Great food!  First time trying arepas and was very satisfied. I ordered the #5 Pernil (roasted pork butt)and it was great!! Taste just like grandma would have made them... if I was Venezuelan of course. I also ordered a coconut & cheese Pastelito. Very good too."}
{"text":"The arepas are very good and everything tasted so fresh.  Yes, it was kinda pricey, about $35 for two of us, but my eyes were too big for my stomach and I ordered two arepas when one was plenty.  I had the Reina Pepiada (chicken,  avocado,  mayo, cilantro) and ordered the Carne Asada but was too full to try.  Will give to my son.  My friend had the Garlic Shrimp (amazing!) and the Vegetarian and he was in Heaven!  We also had the chicharron and fried yuca, also delicious."}
{"text":"Really clean and inviting atmosphere, service was nice and happy to answer questions and offer good suggestions. We got a few of the arepas, wood fire chicken, shredded beef, reina pepiada. all of the arepas were great, want to try more next time. Had chicken and beef empanadas. we enjoyed all of the food we ordered, really filling. Can't wait to go back again and try more of the arepas."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The wood fired meat is amazing. The sauces they offer to put on them, especially the cilantro sauce, makes it something worth driving to. I recommend it to anyone coming in town to visit, or any local who is lucky enough to be repeat visitors."}
{"text":"If you're considering this place just go ahead and do it! It is sooooooo amazing. My bf and I HAVE to stop here every time we are in Vegas!! I wish I could bring this place home with me. My favorite thing is the beef Arapa!"}
{"text":"I go to vegas once a year and I love this place...its my first stop when I am in town!! the chicken and avocado arepa has been my favorite for the past few years.. my daughter loves the grill cheese and grilled chicken. I cant wait to head back and have another...."}
{"text":"After seeing the fabulous reviews on most review sites I thought I'd give it a try. I made it a mission to come here the first night I spent in Vegas. I'll start off by saying that the staff was friendly and the prices were very cheap and affordable (5 stars for that) however, the food was a let down.   We ordered a few dishes to share since it all looked good and we figured it's cheap enough not to break the bank. Can't say we were all that impressed by what we got. The meat dishes were quite bland and dry. Even the drinks didn't have much flavour. The only thing I enjoyed were the beans, rice, and plantains. Definitely not worth the $20 cab ride there and back. Perhaps I had set my expectations too high because of the reviews. I wouldn't tell anyone not to eat here but I will say don't set the bar too high."}
{"text":"Had the cheese tequeno. Yummy. Had the pabellon arepa (minus the meat) and this was delish!  Also had the guava and cheese pastry. This place is located off the strip, but not too far. Easily accessible by uber or a cab. Very nice people working there. Food came out fast. Ample seating indoor and outdoor. Green salsa was a great zing!"}
{"text":"If you want fresh arepas, this is the place to go to when you're tired of the other Vegas food! Great price for your buck and stomach!"}
{"text":"So Gosh darn good!  It's conveniently close to my office so huge shame on me for not visiting this place sooner.  I ordered the shredded beef arepa and a shredded chicken empanada.  I'm kicking myself though for not trying the beef tongue arepa.  That's when you know a place is really authentic.  When it offers body parts that turn people off when they see them in the menu, you know you've found something good.  Next time I'll try that arepa and see how it tastes.    For now though, I greatly enjoyed it, the chicken and beef were delicious and the sauces they came with on the side were perfect!  No ketchup needed, and just the right amount of spice.  Looks like I found a new downtown lunchspot for those days when I can't stomach the nearby cafes."}
{"text":"Food stand selling meat across a strip club selling a different kinda meat --- SO FUNNY and SO VEGAS!  I've heard so many things about this place, especially since my co-worker is Venezuelan. So after work, we decided to trek on over to (almost) DTLV.  Three friends and I split: beef tongue arepas, roasted pork butt arepas, shrimp arepas, and ham and cheese arepas. WOW, it's for sure what Misty said: HOT POCKETS BUT, WAY BETTER!!!!!! There was so much flavor in the meat. It was marinated well and dripping in juices or sauces.  Also, tried the gyobano (sp?) drink and a coconut dessert similar to an empanada. That drink tasted exactly like the fruit which is funny cuz I haven't had that fruit since I was a kid in Hawaii.  Service was cool and they had 2 for 1 arepas. It's, also, kinda fun to just eat on the streets of Vegas. Not those fancy schmancy restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"Very clean. This business keeps their store immaculate and that is comforting. It's bright and seems like you are going to get some fast food quality but it's far better than any chain fast food.  The service is patient, kind, and helpful, Ask questions..you can see right into the kitchen. I was looking for empanadas because I was thinking about some delicious ones I had before in South America.  The arepas are amazing and so are the empanadas. There Are lots to choose from and if you are confused they have photographs all over the store to display what you are choosing.  There is this corn cheese pancake thing that is a must have. Come on an empty stomach and order everything! You will want to try it.  Love this place, I think the have a food truck too.  I would ask them please make empanadas de choclo? Corn and cheese...without the sweet"}
{"text":"This Venezuelan food is authentically delicious! I highly recommend you try them if you're in Vegas. They have a location on & off the strip. Beautiful, delicious, authentic food ! Definitely coming back to try their other Arepas & fried Yucca next time we're in Vegas! My only regret is that they don't have any locations in California."}
{"text":"They moved about a block down the street to a larger establishment with plenty of indoor and outdoor tables. You could walk there from Dino's Lounge. I think they're even better now than the first time I tried them. The portion is generous and the pork butt arepa has so much flavor!"}
{"text":"Great service tequeños aré wonderfull i eat some azada empanadas  great choice im coming back next time im in Vegas. High recomended"}
{"text":"Comfortable indoor, outdoor dining in the heart of Las Vegas. My faves are the BBQ pork Ribs, fried yucca, passion fruit juice and the wood fired chicken is delicious as well. Friendly personal service."}
{"text":"I tried Viva Las Arepas when in Vegas at the recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed. It's in a sketchy area on Rainbow Blvd near a lot of wedding chapels, but when you get inside, everyone is really friendly and nice. It is not a sit down restaurant, you go up to the cash register and order (kind of like at a mall fast food joint) and they give you your food on a tray with a bottle of sauce. I ordered the reina pepiada arepa, which was a chicken arepa with cilantro and avocado... it was delicious! There are tvs to watch while eating your food and several tables to dine at. They make some really good arepas!"}
{"text":"Next time I'm in Vega I'll certainly be stopping here again. I was in my hotel room searching for a cure to my hunger pains when I ran across rave reviews for their pork butt arepa. I dragged my friend here so I could try it out, she ended up trying to the chicken. I was so greedy I had to try 2.   The pork butt and the chicken/mayo/avocado arepa were on my list to try. The pork butt hands down was my favorite. The other was very fresh and creamy a very good just not what I wanted after scarfing down the delicious pork arepa.   The service was also great. The guy running the register took his time to answer all my questions and even make recommendations as to the best sellers. I'll be looking for an imitation in LA to hold me over until I return."}
{"text":"On Las Vegas Blvd half between the Strip and Downtown this little gem of a place has great food at a price you won;t find anywhere else in Las Vegas. I went two days in a row and I will be back again. I want to try everything..."}
{"text":"#2 arepa with avocado. So good! I was questioning this place at first, admittedly judging a book by its cover. But such a great little find."}
{"text":"So, they're basically like tortas, but the \"bread\" part is less like your typical starchy bread. The bread is like an english muffin (in this case I'm going to make it up and say it's more like a Venezuelan muffin than an english muffin) with a soft corn tortilla texture or flavor (because that is what it probably is).  I ordered the WOOD FIRED CHICKEN, PORK BUTT, CARNE ASADA arepa. You know they hold true to their word when they say wood fired when you can see the wood that they cook the meat in stacked in an area where you can see. Also, you can taste that delicious smoky, wood fired flavor in your meats. I'm no wood connoisseur so unfortunately I can't tell you what type of wood they used based on the flavor of the meats. I also don't eat wood on a regular (insert laughing emoji here).  You get the option of adding cheese ($0.50) and avocado ($0.99) for an extra charge. Based on experience, unless you're really lactose intolerant, I suggest you DEFINITELY get cheese. If you're feeling adventurous, add that avocado (and then pat yourself on the back for being so damn awesome). Also, add that green sauce. It'll take your mouth on a journey it has never been before. Put all that together, and what do you call that? A fiesta.  If you're on a date (like I was), I would say, pick THREE different arepas, or if you're the type who can eat food the size of a water buffalo, I would pick one of everything, and then...SHARE!   REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD SHARE:  1.) It makes more strategic sense to be able to conquer every food item on the menu in one shot 2.) Sharing is caring (DUH!) 3.) It makes a perfect talking point during your date (\"What's your favorite?\" \"Oh, I like the wood fired chicken.\" \"Oh I like the wood fired chicken too.\")  4.) Diversifying is important 5.) Again, variety people. VARIETY! 6.) It's fun  #YoureWelcome"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! Located on the corner of LV Blvd & Oakey, Viva Las Arepas is smack dab in the middle of what I'd consider a downtown hot spot, neighboring other local favorites - Vickie's (formerly Tiffany's) Diner, Art of Flavors, Dino's, Albo Pizza, Olympic Gardens, and that little shack that was once Goodwich.  They have a decent-sized menu with plenty of affordable combo options. I usually order the 3 chicken breasts + rice + beans for $6.99, along with a can of Coke for another $1.25, which is a pretty sweet deal to me since I'm always leaving with leftovers I can enjoy the next day. Their arepas are pretty tasty too, of course! And you can stuff 'em with whatever meats, cheeses, etc., you desire.  I especially love the layout of the restaurant. It's always very clean and cool indoors, and the patio area is great."}
{"text":"Consistently Delicious! My favorite is the number 4 with cheese! Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"All the food here was incredible. We ordered a few arepas, wood fired beef, chicharrones and yuca, and we simply loved all of it.      We enjoyed the chicharrones with fried yuca, since they were tasty and not overly dry. They made a really nice side dish. Now the arepas. I was initially afraid that they might be small for the price ($5-$6), but they were fairly large and packed with meat. The arepa dough itself was perfect: crispy on the outside and moist/mushy underneath. The garlic shrimp arepa was delicious and I like how they served it cold. It held a good number of plump shrimp and tons of great garlic flavor.      While the shrimp was good, the best thing I ate was the wood fired chicken arepa. The chicken was amazingly good. Very tender and wonderful smoky flavor. The wood fired beef was delicious as well, as it too was tender and smoky. I was quite impressed when I saw employees wheeling in wooden logs through the back to the smoker. You wouldn't expect a restaurant like this to have a smoker dedicated to smoking the meat, but Viva Las Arepas does, and this becomes clearly evident when you taste the meat.     Overall, this instantly became one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, and I'd love to come back. The food is cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"I come every time I'm in Las Vegas, sometimes more than once. I dint have a favorite area because they're all so good, but you can't go wrong with any of their favorited ones on the menu.   They also have great service, and I sometimes like to believe it's because they remember from my last visit. :)"}
{"text":"My tastebuds are doing backflips from how delicious this food is. First time here and the arepas just melt in your mouth. Well cooked and prepared. The empanadas are simply perfect. Outside slightly sweet like a donut but the inside has the most savory taste. I would recommended this to anyone. I will be coming back to attempt to eat everything off the menu."}
{"text":"WOW! got the asada Arepa with avocado and cheese. Very flavorful with a bold Smokey taste. The texture of the bread was slightly crispy on the outside but the bite is so soft and melts in your mouth! I also tried the chicken empanada. Probably the most satisfying empanada i've ever had. The chicken itself Had a very rich flavor of different spices and the shell is not hard. also, a soft melt in your mouth texture. I would definitely recommend to families and friends especially from out of town visiting. I will be coming back to try more of what the menu has to offer! Great customer service clean and affordable place to dine in  they also provide different kinds of dinner entres if u are interested. Note that Arepas have a hearty stuff and they are 5.50ea. excluding add ons. (Cheese, avo, etc.) ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I'm not big on trying new food or cuisines I've never had but the staff wad friendly and helpful and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Never had an Arepa until I went to this place.  I'm hooked!  I've been back at least 4-5 times since.  Not only are the Arepas perfect, they have bbq chicken with rice that has a insanely delicious Smokey flavor.  Their cilantro creamy sauce is a must!  Service is great also."}
{"text":"Really good food! I haven't have Venezuelan food in a long time and it was just what I need it!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely helpful. They had a very kind staff and the arepas were legendary! So much deliciousness in the arepas! I wish i had more room to try all the different types of arepas but I definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Venezuelan food!"}
{"text":"Marinated chicken or shredded beef inside fluffy flatbread buns , made fresh ! Empanadas also light fluffy and bigger than the usual size you see in the supermarket.  Great with mango or soursop drink!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing. My husband usually has a BIG appetite, but we were both full after one. This stuff is seriously delicious and I was thankful that half of the menu was in English! Juicy meat, flavorful condiments, and it tasted like nothing else I've had before. So glad that I found this in Vegas!   Gotta try the pork belly arepa and the tostones!"}
{"text":"1st time eating Arepas and they were excellent!!!  We had puerco y carne Asada and they were both great.  Salsas especially the white one were really good.  We had the grilled chicks also.  It was good but was not right off the grill so it could have been better fresh.  Will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"I got the carne asada arepa with cheese. It was pretty good but I probably wouldn't get it again. My friend got the reina pepiada which was pretty good. The fried plantains were bomb! And their passion fruit drink was really good too! My friends also liked the empanadas."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to going to downtowns hipster, potentially expensive restaurants. Two people can have a filling, delicious, and different meal. It's close to an awesome custard place also!"}
{"text":"Saw this spot while at Luv-It custard one night so looked it up and decided to try it.  Tried the marinated pork (# 5) and the shredded chicken w/avacado (#7) Both were very good and had great flavor. They also had a squeeze bottle with a tomatillo and jalapeno sauce in it that added some kick to it which I loved. Food was very good and so was the service. Spoke with the owner for a while and he let me try some juices and my wife try the #7 meat before we bought as she is not a fan of mayo but she really dug it.  This place is also open late and is priced pretty reasonably. the portions are perfectly sized and around 3.50 each and IMO a good deal.   This is a great little spot and I will be back for sure...anyone complaining or hatin on this place is prob a whiny fu*^%n bi&*h and used to eatin taco bell and should prob head back there. If you want to try some new food and support a non chain type place hit it up..you will at least be glad you tried it.  Yelp on Yelpers"}
{"text":"Probably the best thing I ate this whole trip. I had the #7 and passionfruit juice. It was delicious. It was my first time having arepas. Would definitely come back again. Nice staff and good food."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! Loveeee this place! The food is delicious, served quickly and the restaurant is clean. Sometimes we want some plantains and some of their amazing Arepas, late at night! Love that it's open late, and the fact that you don't have to wait long for a plate of delicious goodness!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place! The food here is so good. I am stuck on #7. My husband tries new things all the time and has loved everything he's tried. Very clean restaurant. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I loved this place when they were in the lil hut up the street..Got my favorite the pepiadas arepas..its like a lil chicken salad guacy mayo combo loved it..everytime,,and the sliced pork butt with tomatoes and add cheese is just as good.Even liked the corn cheese quesadilla tasting one .Havent ventured too far off in menu even though I want to try the chicken...So glad these guys came up with this new restaurant because they seem friendly and all look like this arepas place is working as it's always crowded...Definatly TRY IT..."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place :( 3 stars just for the fried yuca. The meat in my arepa tasted like steamed dog food, had a really gamey flavor. We literally took the rest of our arepas home and gave it to our dog"}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 8 times in the last two months. You can have a meal for under 10 dollars, that will blow your mind. The Arepas are sandwiches made with corn-cake patties for buns, with perfectly marinated meats. I've tried the vegetarian and omnivore versions of the Arepas, and both are out-of-this-world delicious. I've brought colleagues and friends here, and have had a 10 for 10 success in happy faces after the meal. The guava and cheese pastries I get every time to share, and everyone loves those, too. The cachapas (sort of like a quesadilla with corn cake breading) I have to have every time, too, that are salty-sweet unexpected wonderfulness. You can't go wrong with the menu. Everything is good."}
{"text":"The best arepas and cachapas in Las Vegas. Well recommended. Every time when I come to Las Vegas I always make a stop here."}
{"text":"So tasty! This is my second time here and my husband's first. After we were done eating our Arepas and Fried yucca root, he decided to order more. I ordered the Arepas Pabellon. To die for."}
{"text":"Always trying to find new places to eat in Vegas. This is a place I'm definitely letting my.friends know about! Good food, good service!"}
{"text":"Best last minute decision! First time trying aprepas and it was delicious. The costumer service was great, the cashier recommend items on the menu and was very helpful. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Big selection of arepas, tried the pork butt and shredded beef. Service was a bit slow as the cashier chatted with guest in front of me for 5 or 10 minutes since they couldn't decide what they wanted. Food came out quickly after I placed my order though. The pork arepa was pretty salty but had a good flavor. The shredded beef had a sauce on it that was super tasty - wish I asked for some more on the side to dip in. Fried plantains were good, but a little oily. All in all I would return or suggest to anyone who enjoys Latin style food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but I'll definitely be back every time I'm in Vegas. The service is friendly, there's plenty of seating and the food is great. I had the fried plantains, tostones, empanada and an arepa. Everything was delicious. The smoked meat is very tasty. With the sides, I was filled with one arepa and one empanada. Two or three empanadas could be enough to satisfy anyone. They are about twice as big as an Argentinian empanada, which tend to be a little smaller. Restrooms were clean, and there was parking both in front of the building and on the street behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Im town on vacation from Arizona. This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas, hands down. Forget the buffet's and the fancy restaurants, this place is far better. We need you to come Arizona please!!!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to say but this place is down right delicious.   If you've had and liked an arepa then you've got to come here, if you haven't hen you've got to come here. Enough said.   The decor and area of town is a little off putting, and parking can be somewhat odd. Nevertheless, you can definitely taste the love in this food.   They also have vegetarian and vegan options as well. The bean empanadas, and veg arepa are great options for veg and vegans."}
{"text":"Great start to our first visit here with our greeting from Tony. He gave us the breakdown on the menu & recommendations. We tried #1, 12, 13 & a side of yuca. Everything was delicious! And the yuca really did taste like fries! Incredible service & food! Can't wait to come back & try other menu items!"}
{"text":"This place had hit my top ten places to eat at! Simple, but very flavorful. I ordered the Arepas (#1 and 12) and it was so scrumptious, and it's a place to drag all my friends to. Their sauces are on point as well. They definitely have gluten free options for the health conscious. Love love this place"}
{"text":"If you are gluten free and tired of all the same options (crappy gluten free pizza and salads) this is definitely a place you want to hit up! I had no idea Arepas were gluten free until I came here! I am also pescatarian and they have vegan and vegetarian options to choose from. I ended up making my own combination of avocado, cheese, beans and plantains stuffed in my Arepa. It was to die for and one was definitely more than enough! I left full and more than satisfied.   Side note: They also offer Apple play"}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas, how I love thee!   I love their food, especially the: pork butt arepas, grilled steak special, plantains, cheese cachapa (seriously, worthy of being a \"one last meal\") , guava and cheese pastelitos, fried yucca root, passion fruit drink, wood fired mixed grill, and so much more! The creamy cilantro sauce is amazing - I put it on everything.   The first time we went there it was just a little cart on the corner in front of Dino's - they have done so well and reinvested their profits into a lovely little restaurant with an outdoor seating area, and a really comfortable and nice atmosphere. They always remember us when we come in and are so friendly. It is so nice to see good people doing well!   Oh ya, did I mention, the food is amazing? Consistently fresh, hot, and delicious. If their mission was to make me a customer for life - mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp, and all the reviewers!, for helping us find Viva Las Arepas.  This was an awesome experience.  We will be back every time we visit, or even pass by, Vegas.  What a gem.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This places is really awesome I got the black bean and beef arepa wast really in the mood for it but was pretty tasty was really good jus wish Venezuelan food came with hot sauce lol ... but was super awesome looking forward to going back to try there grilled chicken arepas and empanadas as well I hear really good things..."}
{"text":"The arepas are out of this world! I definitely recommend any local and tourist to try this!   Went here for an office lunch outing. (We are located in summerlin) had the wood fired steak arepa and the chicken and peas one. They looked small at first when I saw them hand make them I front of you, they are a bit larger than the palm of your hand. but I could barely finish the second one! We also shared the wood fired chicken, yuka fries, cheese sticks ( forgot what it was called) all delicious! I will def bring people visiting me to this place."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Venezuelan food and I am not disappointed. Awesome combinations of flavor, in particular the #7. The only recommendation I can give is a more expansive drink list, I'm not too sure how diverse Venezuelan drink orders are."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! This was our very first stop on our Vegas trip and regretted not stopping by before we left! We had the Roasted pork butt and Reina Pepiada with an order of their cheese empanadas. The meat was tender and juicy while the chicken/mayo/cliantro combination was bursting with flavor and their cheese empanadas as a hit as well!"}
{"text":"The best Arepas i've had so far!. Great value too. The bread is crunch on the outside and soft inside. It had fresh corn flavor.   Shredded beef & Tongue were very flavorful. These are mine favorite!  Reina Pepiada - a little too creamy for my taste but my friend loved it.   Roasted Pork Butt - good but too salty.   Soursop drink - refreshing!"}
{"text":"So good affordable and filling in all the right places!  Need to stop by for a quick bite its completely worth it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese arepa and the ham and cheese arepa. Both came with mountain of cheese! So Yum! I also ordered the half chicken with side of rice, beans and sweet plantains. The chicken has wonderful mesquite smokey flavor and the sides r perfect too! Makes me miss Miami so much. The side sauces r bomb too!"}
{"text":"Did not not know arepas came in so may varieties.  They were delicious.  My wife had a tropical smoothie and said it was really good also.  Friendly staff too.  I will definitely visit this place every time I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"I promise you that Viva Las Arepas is a little piece of heaven just on the outskirts of the city where you allow all your sins run free. In addition to mindless betting, grandeur casinos, and endless shopping boutiques, Las Vegas is about good eating, and there is a lot of it. I was feeling a little disinterested from fine dining everyday during my little Vegas weekend getaway so my date wanted me to try his cherished best kept secret in Las Vegas which is now one of my treasured eateries that I look forward to trying again upon my next visit.  Located just outside of The Strip near The Stratosphere, Viva Las Arepas wouldn't be noted to be in the prettiest part of the neighborhood. As well as the establishment is not the most elegant, the food was spectacular.  Without knowing exactly what an arepa was, I ordered the Reina Pepiada, a cold chicken salad covered in avocado and mayonnaise dressing whilst my date ordered a wood-fired chicken arepa. We added an additional cheese empanada for me, and a beef empanada for him since I have never had an empanada either.  Once our order was ready, my Reina Pepiada arepa reminded me of an overstuffed torta, but better! and once I tasted my arepa I knew this place was a special gem. The avocado mayonnaise sauce is really something that distinctively brought out the flavours. They also provide two bottles of their signature sauces; reach for the lighter green + garlic one, it is pure heaven, I wasn't shy to spread it all over my food.  The cheese empanada was still warm with gooey cheese. For just 3 dollars, this was delish! They also threw in a little extra extra for us; a sweet guava + cheese pastry, mm!  I cannot stop noting about Viva Las Arepas to my friends and other fellow Yelpers, this is one place not to be missed. I mean, if it wasn't for the cheese empanada order with the surprise sweet treat, I would order two of these on my next return x"}
{"text":"First time visit.. Clean establishment & restrooms were clean. Good impression so far. Along the wall you see pictures of their dishes which All look delicious. I ordered the reina & the boyfriend ordered the shredded beef Arepa & 2 black bean & cheese empanadas. They both were good but the shredded beef had more flavor and it was hot, the reina was more like chicken salad so it was cold. I didn't know. Had I not been biting into chicken bones with the reina, I would have given it 5 stars.    Will be coming back and ordering something else off the menu. Nice and tasty place!"}
{"text":"Got severe food poisoning from eating here. It's been 9 years since I throw up, and I eat here and I'm throwing up all night"}
{"text":"I had never had an arepa before but these are pretty tasty. Would eat here more often if I was in this part of town. Hot and delicious with some softness in the middle still."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a total of 2 times and the first time I wasn't sure on what to order so I had the shredded beef Arepa, I wasn't very impressed because It was nothing special. My friends felt the same way too and were so underwhelmed that we wondered why they have such awesome reviews from everyone else. Well I gave them another chance and I read Melissa Y.'s review before I ordered and she had suggested an Arepa that has a grilled meat. Well since I sometimes try to be on that healthy grind I had the grilled chicken Arepa and boy was she right it was sure tasty. There's 2 sauces they have on the side 1 that comes in a clear bottle and the other in a red bottle. The one in the clear is like a creamy herb sauce similar to Cafe Rio's ranch sauce but less creamy and more \"herby,\" I like it and gives the Arepa more flavor. I wasn't too sure about the red bottle, but my friends liked it as well and said the heat is good and slowly builds on you. Initially people are a little confused on how to describe what exactly an Arepa is. I was sort of describing it as a Taco bell Chalupa or Indian bread sandwiched together, however I was way off because my friend described it as an English Muffin made with corn meal, which is exactly what it is! The inside of this palce is very clean and depending on how busy it is will determine how long it will take  for your food. I was there last night and they served my friends within 5 minutes, but another time they took awhile like 10 to 15 minutes if I remember correctly. I also like the fact they are open late and next to Art of Flavors. There is plenty of indoor seating and this place has a good amount of people eating at night."}
{"text":"If there was one hole-in-the-wall I could take visitors to in Vegas, this would be it. I accidentally stumbled upon this place on a random Sunday after work when the original noodle joint we were going to was closed. Prior to this, I can't say I've ever tried an arepa, but from that day on, I was hooked.   An arepa is a grilled, round, cornmeal patty, which is then stuffed with your choice of meat or filling. The most popular is the reina pepiada, which is filled with grilled chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. It's pretty much a Venezuelan chicken salad sandwich. I also tried the wood fire beef with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese. You can't go wrong with your choices, but my favorite is the reina pepiada for the avocado and cilantro. Also, try the spicy salsa verde with everything! I'm less of a fan of the white sauce.  Although the serving size is perfect, for only $5, you'll be salivating for more. I also always get a side of the fried yucca root, which I prefer over french fries. If you're craving something sweet, the fried plantains are nice too.   Everything is so tasty here that I can forgive the fact that they charge 50 cents for a cup of water. Viva Las Arepas!"}
{"text":"Wanted to go somewhere that wasn't an outright tourist trap or cash grab on the Strip.  Extremely friendly staff, clean facility, great service.  The food was incredible, made to order, and is making my mouth water just thinking about it.  Venezuelan arepas are more like little sandwiches, but are surprisingly filling for their size.  Get plenty of napkins.  When I went I got 3 different arepas to share, and the fried plantains."}
{"text":"Location: The restaurant wasn't that hard to find. The parking lot was a little small, but it shouldn't be too bad to find a place to park if you decide to go on a weekend.   Atmosphere: The restaurant itself is pretty spacious. There was a pretty good amount of places for people to sit.  Service: The guy at the counter was really nice. He was helpful with some recommendations. It was kind of hard for us to hear what order they were calling. They give you two bottles, one red and one white, with your order. That was nice since you usually just go to a counter in other places for the sauces.  Food: I decided to get the chicken salad arepa and shredded beef. The chicken salad was really good. It was nice and saucy. The shredded beef was too hot to eat. I took a couple of bites, it was okay. I decided to save it for later. When I ate it a couple of hours later, I thought it tasted better. My friend decided to try the garlic shrimp. She said it was a little too saucy. At the end of the meal it was leaking and looked really hard to eat. She said it was good at first though."}
{"text":"Wow!  Something new to myself, never tried anything quite like this and I'm glad I had! This place has grew over the years to this new massive location and I can see why, Viva las Arepas is consistently busy! Must be the lovely little handheld Arepa that keep attracting this crowd of gastro daredevils.  Looking at the huge menu it's hard to decide from all the tasty choices, and simple ask of what's popular to the cashier will leave you satisfied. By recommendation I got the wood-fired shredded beef arepa(with cheese *A must!*) and a shredded beef empanada while my guest decided to go for the chicken breast with avocado and cilantro arepa. Omg these savory little corn meal sandwiches are awesome! It has deep flavors that keep you wanting more, everything taste so fresh and homemade not any of that frozen precooked junk that gets passed off on the daily from something so widely known. They also have one of the best hot sauces that I've tasted in Vegas, the suttle spice and richness of the sauce reminded me of La Vic's orange sauce for all you Bay Area folk, and a creamy cilantro sauce to cut the spice if it's not for you!  I will definitely be back here, although for the actual size it could be kinda pricey $4-6 depending on filling and +.50-1.00 for avocado and cheese. Empanadas was $3 for a decent size, they usually have some sort of special going on just pay attention to the small signs near the register! Viva!"}
{"text":"Authentic tasty food just like from Venezuela. There aren't too many of these types of eateries outside of Florida so take advantage & try it, I guarantee you it'll be worth your time & affordability. Arepa rellena de carne asada & las empanadas de carne desebrada was delicious. Oh and that garlic cream is to die for."}
{"text":"Love Viva Las Arepas!  Love arepas in general.  They have many delicious choices to choose from.  Also like that they are downtown north of the Stratosphere.  Returning soon ;-)"}
{"text":"Eat here if you want good grub and a good price! I've had arepas before and these were probably one of the best I've had!  I had the #4 with cheese, my friend had the #3 and my husband had the #12 and a side of plantains.  We were not disappointed, the sauces were amazing also! I could have just drank them straight from the bottle.  They stuff the arepas full of meat and they are dripping with meaty goodness! People complaining about too much sauce or juices, don't know what they are talking about.  Who wants dried meat?  Not me!  If I wasn't bursting at the seams after my meal, I would have gotten more to go.  I considered driving by and getting some on my way to the airport because it probably could have helped my hangover.  I didn't think the neighborhood was that bad, but I'm not usually deterred by a few run down buildings or some graffiti.  I will be back and I'll be dreaming of it until I can have it again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something just off the strip and is really good come here. The ribs were delicious and my wife had an arepas with chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. My sons had ribs and pork rind with yuca."}
{"text":"Arepas have recently become my food obsession, but I had never had one in Las Vegas before. I remembered this place existed and then had a friend ask me if I've been there, so it was on my list to try.  Today I went to my boss's storage unit down the street, and I was pretty excited to find out I could order food directly on the Yelp mobile app. An arepa for $5? How is that even possible in the US? It was a damn tasty arepas, especially once I discovered the hot sauce. I literally cannot wait to go back and have more arepas."}
{"text":"This was my first Arepas experience and I am glad I chose VIVA LAS AREPAS for it.  We had the Smoked Beef Arepa $6. The meat was really smokey, excellently seasoned and marinated. It came with a slice of tomato and letucce.  Eat it with the creamy green sauce and your taste buds will thank you!   Even though I really enjoyed it I felt that $6 for an Arepa seemed a bit too much.  Extra for cheese $0.60, Avocado $.99, ...  I will come back when in town for a quick bite.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Having just spent 2 months in Venezuela eating arepas every day I can say that the flavors here are authentic and delicious.  The reina popiada is the bomb..you have to try it!!"}

{"text":"This place is really good Venezuelan food. Had the chicken arepas, black beans, and fried plantains. The fried plantains was my favorite. All was really good!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. Worth trying but not sure I'd return. Very fresh food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Perfection... Every time. When the man asks if you want cheese on your arepa, you say YES! When you get your arepa and they give you sauce YOU PUT THAT SAUCE ON YOUR AREPA. It is just so so good. You'll be eating it and thanking that anonymous yelper that said go for it"}
{"text":"Sitting there after the food had arrived and having taken a couple of bites, we start to discuss how many stars we would give Viva Las Arepas. Factoring in the convenient location off the main strip, clean and bright interior, super friendly staff, and yummy, fresh comfort food. We both agreed that if this restaurant was in San Diego, we could see ourselves frequenting weekly. Hands down we agreed 5 stars! We ordered the Carne asada arepas, chicken empanada, and fried plantains. Prior to this I had never had an arepa or Venezuelan food so I didn't know what to expect. It had a familiarness that reminded me of Colombian food. And all I know is that it was delicious and an overall great experience that left me already wanting to come back."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese and I love Hispanic food! I will be the pickest water you will ever meet, and this restaurant is the only place in Las Vegas that has ever satisfied my standards. Every Hispanic restaurant lacks authenticity, quality, and passion.   The arepas, empanamdas, and drinks are so authentic that I feel like I'm in Salvador. My favorite are the roast pork butt arepas, as well as the wood fire beef arepas. And yes, they cook everything on  real wood.    The restaurant is so clean that you can eat off the floor. I'm not kidding. The floor is a well polished tile floor, with all wood furnishings and beautiful light fixtures. Honestly, you can find a restaurant like this in a high end resort.   The business owner, Felix takes incredible pride in his food. Everything is made in order, in house. All the beans, meats, and rice are made in house. Every other place uses refried beans and frozen meats. Never have I been to such a great restaurant where the employees love what they do, and the owner personally remembers you.   In all honestly. I name this restaurant the best Hispanic food in Las Vegas. More importantly I rate this restaurant as one of the best places I have ever eaten in. I want to personally thank Felix for providing such a authentic, and quality dining experience in my office."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork butt with avocado, tomato, and a side of their creamy cilantro dressing. Loved the crispy and flavorful maize flatbread, and the creamy dressing that elevated the pork. Make sure you take a friend and order over $10 worth of food, or get a $.50 service charge, if you plan on paying with credit card."}
{"text":"Found this place looking on Yelp for places to eat while I was in Las Vegas and I'm glad I found this place, this was my first time trying Venezuelan food so I didn't know what to order,so after looking at the menu for a while I decided on the Carne Asada Arepas and a side of black beans and rice, the Arepas are like little sandwiches,the buns are like cornbread and tortilla with good size chunks of wood cooked carne Asada 5 stars all the way. The black beans where real good too they had like a spicy taste to them. Will be back on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"mmm mmm mmmmmmmm this is the only place where I have tried Venezuelan food and I loved it. My friend and I pig out and ordered everything and there wasn't one bad dish. I will definitely be back to try the other stuff on the menu. There were so many delicious options, I have to try everything!!"}
{"text":"When I first looked into my beautiful wife's eyes I was immediately hypnotized! Today the Arepas was almost as memorable! My family and my Compadre Edgar's Familia are always looking for some good eats. I thought this place deserved some major props!!! The place is located in a very busy corner but once u enter the doors the service was spectacular and the lady behind the counter was very patient and willing to explain everything on the menu. Gracias Señora! My queen ordered a Reina Pepiada Arepa for herself, a Pabellon Arepa for myself & half a pollo for my handsome boys, and guess what we finished all our food and also my compadres' food the plantains he ordered were so sweet and good. Once u taste there sauce u cannot stop I found myself pouring it onto my palm and licking it off! YES!!! I considered drinking it straight from the bottle. We are from Califas and the next time we visit Vegas we will definitely eat here again. So why 4 stars I am a very picky eater as my primo Xavi says. I was still wanting more wish the Arepas were slightly bigger and my Pabellon was slightly salty but very tasty! Finalmente, Viva Las Arepas. Hasta Luego!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  This unassuming food stand really packs a punch. Having never tried venezuelan food before, I pulled up here one evening for some late night snacks. I tried the original, hot beef and cheese arepa. Out of this world. The little corncake that they stuff it all into is perfect- the consistency is amazing, and the taste is just out of this world. The meat filling is like the barbacoa at Chipotle- except 80 times more flavorful. Also, the guys who work there are super nice too!  If you're looking for something different and new for a great price, I highly recommend I Heart Arepas. Make this a place to visit on your next trip!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a co worker and I wasn't disappointed.  I will definitely be back for the guava and cheese arepas."}
{"text":"Great small mom and pop style Venezuelan place  Arepas are awesome. Very tasty little Sandwiches. I want to try them ALL  Friend pork rinds + yucca root was very good.   Empenadas were excellent   I love the two bottles of salsa they give you.  Delicious  Great atmosphere   And the prices are extremely reasonable.  Especially in a town with ridiculously overpriced crappy restaurants  Viva this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today after having my car serviced and I have to stick with my 5 star review from before.  The gentleman who took my order was really friendly and answered my questions about the drinks.    I ordered a Reina Pepiada, an arepa made with shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  I also got a coconut and cheese pastelito for a dessert.  For my drink, I had asked the clerk about the Malta Polar, a Venezuelan soda, made with molasses instead of sugar.  He said he liked it and I gave it a try.  It was tasty--a bit strong--but it was curiously refreshing.  Wait, that one's taken!  It was very good and it was a good accompaniment for lunch.  When he brought my food, he also brought the three squeeze bottles of sauces.  The red bottle--this is a nice spicy sauce that gave the arepas some kick.  The yellow bottle had a spicy cilantro sauce and this too had a kick.  The white bottle had the mild sauce, but it was OK.  I tried it and then went back to the premium grades.  Coconut and cheese seemed an odd combination to me, but I love coconut, so I had to give this a go.  What a pleasant treat!  The cheese mixed with the coconut had a symbiotic relationship and they went well together.  I guess I'll just have to make it a more common experience to drive the few miles from my car dealership after service and have lunch here!  Viva Las Arepas and Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time having Venezuelan food and I had the BBQ ribs.  That was a mistake.  The ribs were good but they were not traditional cuisine for this place.  I should have gone with a more traditional Venezuelan meal.  The wife did and loved it, she had one of the sandwiches I think it was an Arepas.  She loved it!  I will say that they did smoke their ribs on site and used real wood to cook with.  Will go back here again and get something more traditional next time."}
{"text":"WOW! I have never had Venezuelan food, but my bf and I are always up for something new. Aside from the hilarious name of the restaurant, this place has some seriously good food! We never eat on the strip when in Vegas because it's overpriced and generally not very good. This place made it to the top of our search because of it's high ratings, and this time, Yelp did not let us down.   Arepas, for those that don't know, are maize (corn) dough stuffed with meat or other fillings and toppings. It's a Latin spin on a pita-like sandwich. Although I have nothing to compare this to, I was very impressed. The bread was hot and fluffy and sweet - everything you love about corn-based bread. We got the Wood Fire Beef and Reina Pepiada (a chicken salad with avocado, mayo, and cilantro). I liked that we got one with hot filling and one with cold filling. We also ordered fries, which were just standard frozen fries, but they were piping hot and crispy, so they were perfect.   Prices were reasonable, and the service was friendly. Will definitely stop by again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I've eaten authentic Venezuelan food before and this place is not bad.  My last visit I ordered the Wood Fire Mix Grill (for two people), consisting of chicken, beef, pork ribs and sausage with two sides for $22.99.  The ribs (which are large spare ribs) and the chicken were excellent; the beef was a little dry and it had a little bit too much spice.  I guess it was a brisket but over spiced and too dry.  The sausage was flavorful but I didn't care for the texture of it.  My sides were the fried Yucca plant and rice with vegetables, which were decent.  I also had the plantains, which were excellent.  They do serve nice size portions and it's right near the Strip with parking.  Overall, I would try it again for the chicken and spare ribs."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I am going to be on a mission to find something similar to this in San Diego. We ordered the number 1 which is chicken and a number 7 which is shredded beef. Both were delicious! I definitely recommended trying this place when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"\"I Love Arepas\" is not only the name of this food stand, it is also what you will be saying after you eat here!  Their specialty, of course, are the Venezualn corn cakes, or arepas. They are served warm and freshly cooked. I ordered a chicken (hot) and shrimp (cold) arepa along with a beef empenada. My favorite was the shrimp. The cold filling and the warm arepa made for a great combo. The shrimp was in a garlic, parsley sauce that was not too rich and very garlicky! It was delicious. The chicken, I was not so crazy about. I am not sure if it was deliberate or not, but there was a sourness to it that made it unappetizing. The beef in the empenada was only okay. It was a seasoned ground beef. I thought it would be more of a pulled or chopped beef.  The star throughout the meal was the corn cake: warm, nice texture, not too oily was great. Prices were decent, with the shrimp being the most expensive of my dishes at $5.   The location is a little sketchy and a little difficult to get to with all the one way streets everywhere, but definitely worth the effort.  Be aware, the stand is closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating arepas so I didn't know what to expect, but I'm definitely a fan. It reminds me of a sandwich full of wood-fired meat stuffed between 2 flatbreads made of maize. The place is a bit off the strip and the area is a little sketchy (it's across from a stripclub called \"OG\"), but it's worth it if you want to grab a quick and cheap bite. The soursop juice here is also delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious! If you are debating about trying, stop and just go. You won't regret it!:) I highly recommend the vegetarian arepa and tostones!"}
{"text":"Great customer service from whom I presume was the owner. He was attentive and even hooked us up with an empanada after a miscommunication when ordering. I didn't know that the Reina pepiada was a cold arepa which was a little dissapointing to me since the last time I had one, it was a hot arepa. Still great tasting, just off to me because of the cold/hot thing. A little pricey for arepas but this is on the strip so that's probably why. Small seating area but even if I had to take it to go I would !"}
{"text":"The best Arepas I've ever had! Shhh, don't tell my mother in law (she's Venezuelan)  FOOD: Arepas cannot be accurately described by words. They must be experienced, and the best place to experience it is at Viva Las Arepas.    Reina Pepiada- Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro. Such a great flavor profile.  Pabellón- Beef, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese. This is my second favorite, the beef is cooked perfectly. The beans and plantains compliment the beef and we all know cheese makes everything better  The empenadas are also delicious, try them all. They're like a dollar, stop being so cheap and try all of them. You're welcome.   IN CONCLUSION:  This is usually the first place I go when I land in Vegas. There is a reason they have 8 million 5 star reviews. IT IS AMAZING. Stop reading this and book your ticket or get in you car and drive to vegas and feast at Viva Las Arepas!"}
{"text":"The best arepas I've had outside of Venezuela and they're fairly priced (precios solidarios). The only arepas I've seen in San Francisco are $10.75. I used to eat here when it was a food stand. The owner Felix is a great guy, despite being an esqualido. Nobody is perfect. I'm very happy that he has a restaurant now. I wish him much success."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The service was so great! My family and I were helped through everything since it was our first time. We were given samples of their dishes and also all their different fruity beverages. The food was very tasty itself and filling! The meal we ordered came with a bunch of meat selections w/ two sides which we chose rice and black beans. It was all very good and filled us up perfectly! I would definitely come back to try more of the menu. This is a easy 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"I had to come here while on vacation in Vegas bc unfortunately there are no cachapas in Chicago! We were very happy with the arepas and their fresh fruit waters! The cashiers were very helpful and hospitable!  Please open a restaurant in Chicago!"}
{"text":"I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.  I've had Viva Las Arepas on my radar for a while.  I just never get to visit this part of town all that often.  Since we went for a last hurrah at the Art of Flavors next door, we figure why not get an arepa to go as well?  Off to Viva Las Arepas we were!  Décor is nice inside, very spacious with another large outdoor veranda area.  It wasn't too busy on a Saturday night, only a few patrons on several of their tables.  But I did notice that the take out business was steady.  Lots of folks going in and out.  I was never familiar with arepas, all I knew was that they were a type of Venezuelan street food.  Any kind of street food sounds tasty to me!  Our cashier was gracious and asked us if we had been to Viva Las Arepas before.  We told him no so he proceeded to let us know what an arepa is and some of their most popular flavor combinations.  Basically, an arepa is a round patty made of cornmeal, grilled, then stuffed with various meats and cheeses.  Sold!  Had to try one (or two).  We ordered to go:  -Wood Fire Beef Arepa -Reina Pepiada Arepa (chicken breast, avocado, mayo & cilantro) -Fried Plantains  Waiting wasn't long, and before I knew it we were ready to go.  But, all our food came in one tiny plastic bag.  I was like, \"This all our order?  Salsa on the side too?\"  Dude was, \"Yep, you're all set.  Salsa in little containers, two each.\"  Really?  Bag wasn't that heavy at all.  Take it home and I'm already antsy for some grub 30 minutes later.  Open up the bag - one round Styrofoam container.  One long Styrofoam container.  Hmmm...am I missing an arepa?  Turns out, nope!  These arepa thingies are just a bit on the small side.  They really are.  Smaller than a sandwich, but bigger than a cookie.  What gives?  I felt like I was Godzilla with this little itty-bitty snack in my hand.  But, that morsel of arepa was pretty good!  I had the Reina Pepiada, arepa was still warm, crispy on the outside, but some good chew on the inside.  Chicken with avocado, mayo & cilantro made for a great filling.  Very tasty, and a good kick with their house green salsa.  Wifey liked the taste of her Wood Fire Beef arepa, goot hint of smoke with moist beef.  Fried plantains were good too, but that's really hard to mess up.  Overall, this was a good SNACK.  Guys my size would need two arepas to make a MEAL.  But, at around $5 a pop per arepa...for $10 you can go to the local Chinese buffet!  I liked Viva Las Arepas but not sure I would go out of my way that often to get it.  But the experience was good, and I would gladly have another arepa from there sometime down the line.  Perhaps they should have a food truck going around, too?  This is perfect food to sober up with!  Or down with a Corona!  How do you say \"ole\" in Venezuelan?  Good but pricey."}
{"text":"Short review!  (will include an update in a month)  Viva Las Arepas!!!  Oh Viva Las Arepas!  Located on an unseemly street corner (Believe it was LVB/just pass Charleston - be sure to be on the look out!)  sits a tiny little 10x12 shack of goodness!  This past Vegas trip was all about exploring the local food scene outside of the main strip, and boy did we experience some delicious treats such as these Arepas!  Since it was simply a tasting... our part of 4 decided to share on one arepa... Reina Pepidas!  Yes... 4 sharing one......  Reina Pepidas is this arepa (corn meal bun toasted with savory fillings) that is filled with shredded chicken mixed with cilantro, avocado, green peas, and mayo..... just think of it as a chicken salad sandwich on steroids!  Super delicious!!!!!  The flavor of the cilantro and avocado coupled with slightly crispy buns of the corn meal made this a super filling yet delicious treat before actual lunch!    Sauces comes with it too... I believe one of them is a delicious non-spicy cilantro sauce while another one is a spicy salsa that could potential knock your socks off!  Mixing all the flavors together will create a different yet awesome flavor that you surely don't want to miss.  Our party was looking at the pork butt arepa but since we were heading over for actual lunch, we decided to give it a try next time...  Is there a next time?  Hell ya!  They've done pretty well to a point that we noticed that an actual storefront is in the works just closely down the street... I bet it's going to be crowded when that completed...  But in the mean time, be sure to keep your eyes open for the little tiny shack that is on a street corner.... don't judge the book by it's covers.... you will be pretty amazed on what you find here at Viva Las Arepas!  Until next time Arepas!!!"}
{"text":"None of us had ever had Venezuelan food before, so we were unsure of what to expect. We walked in, completely confused by the menu and what arepas were. The staff were so informative and also showed us what one looked like prior to ordering. I ordered the chicken arepas, with an avocado mayo and cilantro. The arepas itself was absolutely amazing. Full of flavor, paired by a delicious, warm rice or corn buns. Best part, they're naturally gluten free!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the Pabellon with black beans, plantains and the shredded beef. Went rediculous with their special sauces!!! I look forward to coming back; their mesquite grilled chicken and Reina Pepiada look legit."}
{"text":"This is my second arepa stop this week, i wanted to show some love at the new location. This time I made an order mistake getting the pepiada. I asked for no mayonaise and was told it couldnt be removed as it was part of a chicken salad style prep. The guy insisted there was barely any used and that it was not noticeable- WRONG!  -1 star  Way too much mayo, which made the meal taste plain and overly rich- which led to a post consumption stomach ache and regret.   The wood grilled meats are superb and next time I will stick with those or the Pebellon."}
{"text":"1st time I had Arepas I have no idea what should I get. He recommend #7  He was so helpful to me and he show me some pictures on screen  But the food was so so... warm bread with cold chicken inside:( don't taste right ....  and my stomach feel so weird maybe because cream cheese?? But on menu don't show they put any cream ...  I had one bite and need to take home  I just never try the Arepas  I will try to come back and try maybe shrimp next time..."}
{"text":"Short time in Vegas, tried a few things outside the casinos, came back here for seconds, Excellent! thank you!"}
{"text":"My friend randomly said how he always passes by a place called \"I Love Arepas\" on his way to work.  After seeing Bobby Flay's Throwdown, I saw those two Venezuelan sisters and knew I needed to try those one day.  I took it as a sign and couldn't say no to going!   Drive there and find it is TINY! I want to say it's about 10 by 10 feet with a handful of bar type chairs by the window and a couple tables by the street. It's definitely not a restaurant. More of a food truck slash stand.  If you haven't guessed, it's kind of \"ghetto\" being on LV BLVD across the Olympic Gardens Gentlemen's Club haha.  We were the only ones there. I took it as a bad sign because the chef looked like he was in a bad mood and his up selling techniques made him seem a little unappreciative of having customers by his tone of voice.  The menu is small, everything is under $5.00 being a sort of tamale you can only order to go. The Arepas are about $3-$4 depending on the meat or style and are definitely worth the price. They aren't HUGE so don't expect something with huge portions, but the flavor and specialness of the item is there.   We ordered the #1 which was beef and added mozzarella for $0.50.  I asked for it to go and the chef suggested we eat it there and we'd enjoy it more.  It was DELICIOUS!  An arepa is a masa \"patty\" that gets grilled on both sides so they're crispy, and filled with different meats, veggies, sauces , ect.  The masa is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and the fillings are so good!  I described it as a cross between a tamale, a sopa, and a torta.  There are different hot or cold fillings.  They also have drinks, empanadas, and snacks.  After having it I ordered some to go for my friend and they loved it as well.  Overall love the place. Wish the Gentlemen working was nicer, but every one has those days. The food was great and that's all that matters.  Btw, they serve with two sauces, a creamy green and a spicy/sour red and are both SO GOOD. They also give you sauce to go.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fairly priced and flavorful food.  Staff was super friendly.    I tried the Wood Fire Beef and the Reina Pepiada.  Both awesome, the beef had a nice smoked flavor while the pepiada was really refreshing.   Will come back during my next time in Vegas just to try the rest."}
{"text":"How was this my first time finally getting to Viva Las Arepas? After seeing all the great press, driving by it a million times, and bookmarking it 8 years ago (ish), I finally made it in. My 2nd visit will be much quicker! The vibe inside is friendly and clean, with a cool patio. It's not fancy, but it is definitely above Roberto's. Each arepa is about $5. Pair it with a side of beans or grilled veggies and a soda and you're about $10. Pretty affordable. Most important: the food is really good. Meats are excellent, the arepa itself is doughy, but with that corn texture. Yum. Good for lunch, dinner, kids, adults. Next door to the best gelato ever (except it's never open). They serve beer, too!"}
{"text":"Dang. First time eating arepas and it was incredible. My girlfriend and I ordered everything with a star by the menu item (star indicating chef's recommendation). Each arepa is around $6 so it's not on the cheap side, but it was worth every penny.  Our favorite was the corn and cheese plate (not sure if it actually is an arepa) and the chicken and avocado mix one. We ordered 6 dishes in total and devoured everything.  One thing I wish they offered was a spicier sauce (I think I was in the King Taco mode) but honestly, the creamy and salsa-y sauce they offered were amazing.   Tacos el Gordo was always at the top of my book, but I think it was just topped by Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"Short Review: I'm a fan of Arepas. I'm just not a fan of the Arepas served at Viva Las Arepas.  I got their Beef Empanada and Beef Arepa.  Both were greasy and not worth the price. $5 for an Arepa the size of your fist??  I've had this place bookmarked. Now, bookmark checked! Time to move on.  Longer Review: Viva Las Arepas has been one of my bookmarks since I was introduced to their neighbor, the great Art of Flavors. Yes, Viva is located right next door in case you didn't know.  Upon entering, you're hit with nothing but orange and a menu with a decent selection.  At first, the prices looked pretty good until you get your food. I got the Beef Arepas and a Beef Empanada.  They both tasted \"Just Ok\" and were super oily. For a minute, I thought I was eating a beef chimichanga. Both were also so small that I was able to finish my Arepas in about 3 bites.  I know I can't mention names, but I have had better Arepas out here in Vegas. Better in regards to price, value, and most importantly, taste. All is not lost though.  Their plantains and the service were both excellent.  I may be back, but most likely for their plantains only.  See Ya' But not here...I'll be next door enjoying the best peanut butter gelato."}
{"text":"Like a lot of words, I can't really pronounce it, but I can eat an arepas like a boss!  I had a bite of my co-worker's pork butt (hehe) and it was tasty, but so far, I plan on sticking with the pollo mechada.  The cold shrimp (#6) arepas looked pretty great too when I picked up lunch for my office.  This place is that unique little find: great food at cheap prices.  Don't be scared by the sketchy location and vagrants you see hanging on the street.  This place is too legit to quit."}
{"text":"So me, J.V and Daniel met up at I Love Arepas after having a convo at work about Colombian food ( Daniel's family is Colombian).  I told them about I Love Arepas and we had decided to finally check it out, once we arrived, we realized its Venezuelan and not Colombian but Daniel said arepas is a Colombian dish also? Hmm okay...  Well, it was a very HOT day and since this place is just a stand with a few tables set up, we decided to sit at one of the tables and eat instead of in our cars.  We started with the fruit juices- sugar cane with lime for me, mango for Daniel and Tamarindo for JV.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our drinks, you can tell everything was freshly made. I thought my sugar cane/lime drink would be too sweet but it wasn't, it was PERFECT on this extremely hot day.  Food, we ordered almost everything on the menu..Arepas are like sandwiches with the patties made from cornmeal which is grilled then stuffed with meat, cheese and other delightful things...  Here's what we ordered: Roasted Pork Butt (Hot filling)- yummy! shredded pork similar to carnitas, had great flavor Shredded Chicken (Hot)- also very good, similar flavors to the pork butt Beef Tongue (Hot filling)- oh my, SO good, one of my favorites! tender, slightly spicy Honeycomb Tripe/Menudo (Hot)- another of my favorites in the hot filling category, this was the spiciest of all the arepas we tried. Again, full of flavor with the garlic and spices!  Cold fillings- Reina Pepiada- they said this was their most popular but I was not a fan.  There was just too much mayo going on with this one, I couldn't even eat it all.  It's similar to a chicken salad with avocado and green peas but umm, yeah, too much mayo... Garlic shrimp- this was BOMB, I mean seriously good. It was like having shrimp ceviche in a sandwich...this is a must have!  Empanadas- the guys loved the black bean and cheese, I got the shredded beef.  They loved it and said it tasted really fresh, mine was okay, seemed that my shredded beef had more filling than their black bean/cheese ones.  Hallacas- this alone would have me stopping by daily.  It's the most expensive item on their menu at $5 each but it's so worth it.  It's similar to a tamale with empanada filling wrapped in banana/plantain leaves and steamed.  For me, the cornmeal dough was SO yummy! It' reminded me of a Vietnamese dish very similar to it that's got ground pork and also steamed in banana leaf...this is a HELL yeah dish for me!  After we were done trying all the dishes, we were thirsty again so I ordered the Guava drink next and JV ordered the Guanabana (soursop).  Both drinks again were fresh and you could taste it!  This is a definite return for us, but next time, after the sun goes down or when the weather was cooler!"}
{"text":"This place made me so happy to have met up with my cousin, a local. Would have never even noticed it but it was the first suggestion off her tongue. Speaking of tongue, that was what I picked (to my companions' chagrin) and it was delicious. Try both sauce bottles!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and have been meaning to try this place for awhile.  Finally did and Viva Las Arepas did not disappoint.  Had a tough time deciding what I wanted since all of the Yelp comments recommend just about everything.  I settled on the reina pepiada and fried plantains...wow this was great. Looking forward to going back and trying the pork butt."}
{"text":"We came across this place from Yelp reviews and wanted something different but good off the strip. We were so glad we did!!  So good and filling. Our small family of four ordered the MIX plate which consisted of 3-4 different types of grilled meat. It was all very tasty and tender. Fall off the bone ribs, grilled steak, grilled chicken and sausage. That was pricey 23.99 but we all were able to indulge in the meat fest to our hearts content!   For the side I ordered salad and plantains. I have never really tried real authentic plantains and these were pretty good. A lil too sweet for the rest of the meal. We are about half of them. The salad it was a big plate of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes with a dressing. We didn't really care for that. We also ordered their carne asada arepa. Soooo good we couldn't get enough. A couple chicken and beef empanadas rounded out the meal for the kids. All in all we were so impressed we are def going back during our two week Vegas stay!!"}
{"text":"Ok ok... this little shack has been seeing alot of action on yelp recently so i had to see what all the local yippers were talking about. The location is kind of en, i personally would have like to sit there and grub and people watch a little but there seemed to be more of the owners family and friends just sitting around on a Sunday afternoon taking up space then actual customers enjoying the food and relaxing in a chair. After we got the cook to actually get back into the shack and stop chit chatting with the family outside i was thinking maybe i might finally get to eat. $3.50-$4.50 was the average cost of an Arepa across the board but keep in mind when your asked if you want cheese that its an additional .50cents to your total. Ordering a chicken, beef arepa and a bean and cheese empanada. Got my food and it all fit into a medium sized styrofoam container, this was where i asked is this all of it? yup. Now ill say the stuff smelled good driving in my car trying to find a place to sit and eat. It tasted even better when i Nom Nommed on it in the 5 bites it took me to eat the entire thing. But it left me wanting something more to eat because it did not fill me up at all.   To those looking for a tasty bite/snack to hold you off before a dinner or a late night munchie after a little night life in Vegas sure this is the spot. But if your looking to be stuffed after having one $4 arepa id say only if you were a tiny 90ln chick. You need at least two of these to be a complete meal so keep that in mind when ordering. What id like to see is some better seating for the customers so i dont have to go 5 blocks down the road and park my car. And i think the use of maybe a complete meal package... like 2 arepas one chicken one beef and a little rice and beverage for lets say $10? i think this would not only have customers happy but also the owners would sell quite a few of these instead of many ordering just individual as i did when i sampled the offerings."}
{"text":"Man, I've been waiting for awhile to try this place out. It is always nice to find cheap food relatively close to the strip!  So first off, this place is North of the strip, in between Encore and the Stratosphere. The parking situation is a little lot or if that is filled, they have an empty lot in the back (super dingy at night). As for the decor, it is simple, nice, clean and spacious. The workers are friendly and they showed me the board with the arepas and the chef's recommendations. Each arepas is about the size of a small burger and they all cost about $7. We ended up getting:  Roasted Fire beef- Oh man, such a perfect blend. It's basically carne asada with a smoky flavor. Really good!  Chicken with avocado- A lot of people tend to order this so I gave it a try. The avocado, lime and cilantro blend very well together. It kind of makes it mushy to me. Overall, it was decent.  Roasted Fire chicken- The chicken was soft and tasty.  Passion Fruit juice- Yum! Sweet and tart! I love it!  Lastly, they take card and your food comes out pretty quick. Overall, my meal came out to $20 which is always nice in Vegas. I am a happy camper and I would love to come here again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Forever in my heart.  I discovered this place back in 2014 when I was visiting for Life is Beautiful festival 2014. I have been going to this place every single time when visiting Vegas since then. Most times it's been multiple visits here during every Vegas trip! Location is right between the new strip and the old strip - nearby the Stratosphere from what I can remember.  Other than the arepas, I've tried their empanadas, pastelitos, french fries, and their yucca root. All of them have been really good but nothing will top their arepas! I've had arepas at Bay Area music festivals but never like the ones they make here. Before this place, I've only had plain arepas. Never did I know that these babies can be served in a sandwich pocket-like form.  I'm a pescatarian so I could only speak for the non red meat items. Their chachapa (corn and cheese arepas) are on a sweeter side - definitely pretty tasty but it's pretty greasy to what I'm used to ordering here. When I'm here I usually order two arepas - both flavors differ each other. They are more than happy to custom your order.  The two sauces they offer with these arepas are also pretty good! I remember one is of a creamy consistency and the other one is just green sauce. I love their green sauce! It's got a bit a kick of spice to it.  My meat eater friends seem to love it as well. Not too sure on what they get but all of it looks delicious.   Service is great, the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The place itself is pretty spacious - tons of room to sit. The parking lot is a bit small.  I've been almost 4 months since I've last been here (the longest I've been without it :( ) and I'm suuuuuuuper missing this place.   I wish their hours went beyond midnight. There were too many times after a night out in Vegas when I wish I had arepas. They do delivery as well! Haven't tried that yet though."}
{"text":"The place was worth checking out and the food was decent. It is nice they have vegetarian options I wouldn't mind returning but I'm not itching to go back. I got a vegetarian arepa and thought the portion was a little small for the price."}
{"text":"Todo delicioso, y el servicio: excelente. Comimos arepas y pollo asado, lo cual da opcion para cualquier gusto."}
{"text":"This place bas delicious arepas that are almost as good as homemade! The price and serving sizes are just right and its a quick lunch or dinner spot. The guava cheese dessert is unusually delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I got 2 empanadas and 2 shots of espresso with milk.  I honestly did not know empanadas can taste so delicious.  The coffee also did not disappoint, and I was expecting it to be bad since they really weren't a coffee joint.  My friend got the yucca fries... tasted like fresher sweet potato fries.. loved it with my soul."}
{"text":"tried to go today at lunchtime:  but didn't realize it doesn't open until 3:00pm...would have been nice had someone posted that critical bit of information...so I am - in the hopes that it saves someone else a trip and will be back another day..."}
{"text":"I love coming here because the arepas are filled with flavor and the price is affordable!  It's definitely a place to try esp. if you haven't tried an arepa before. I love the sauces they give you too a spicy and non spicy sauce which is perfect to top your arepa!"}
{"text":"In the past, it was always one and done with my gelato fix, but today, I finally made time to complete the Desert Companion's \"Best Foodie One-Two Punch\" of 2014: Viva Las Arepas followed by Art of Flavors.  I'm glad I tried this place. I went for the pork butt arepa ($4.50) and shredded beef arepa ($5.00), making the cheese upgrade ($0.50) for both. Fried corn filled with a decent quantity of meat is already a recipe for success, and you can add the cilantro sauce (in the yellow or one of the clear bottles) or the spicier red sauce that I sampled a bit of. I think the shredded beef actually had more flavor than the pork butt, but that means the pork butt is a better vehicle for the sauces.  I also tried my friend's fried plantain, which was about as mushy and brown as you'd expect if you just fried a plantain (or banana) on your own at home. It's not very sweet at all, so it's rightfully listed as a side and not a dessert.  The prices could be better given the relatively small portion sizes - I wasn't too full afterward - and the arepas do lack just a bit of the extra flavor oomph that would take it to the next level. However, I could see myself coming back here for future \"one-two punch\" trips.  P.S. Art of Flavors was solid, as usual.  (UPDATE: Downgrade from 4-stars to 3-stars. After having tried Rika Arepa Express, the other big game in town, I realized how lacking in flavor these arepas are. Oh, and Street Dogs also does arepas better.)"}
{"text":"Everything was so good; I had the roasted pork butt arepa w avocado and cheese, he had the carne Asada, we shared fries and a cheese empanada.  The sauces were great, even the fries were the perfect fried-ness.  I first noticed I liked this place because it felt up to date w their tv screen menus and tablets for their point-of-sale system.  Look forward to coming back and trying a different arepas!"}
{"text":"Where have Arepas been all my life?  If this is Venezuelan food then sign me up! I'm very glad I didn't immigrate to Venezuela as I would probably would have ended up being a 400lb whale on the beach snacking on Arepas all day.  Once again the Yelp community didn't steer me wrong. For weeks I've been seeing yelpers rave about this place, so I decided it was time.  Located on Las Vegas Blvd and East Oakey Blvd, Viva Las Arepas is a store down from the other favorite Art Of flavors. The parking is very limited, so be prepared to maybe park somewhere close by. Trust me the walk is worth it.  After going around their menu I decided why not the Pork and chicken Arepas. Served on a rectangular  dish, they were served pretty much hamburger style. With a hot sauce and what seemed like a tart sauce are served with your meal. Both dishes bursts with flavor. The breading I think was freshly made. Big credit. Very filling meal if your trying one or two.   To drink they have canned soft drink and bottled water. The real stuff is the juices they have on tap. I can not remember what juice I had but it was a suger cane drink of some sort. It complemented the meal quite well. Tell your friends, this place is bomb  Overall Service: 4-5 Drink: 4-5 Food: 5-5 Cleanliness: 4-5 Coming back: Yess"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite spots in Vegas, and I love bringing friends here who are visiting from out of town. Amazing Venezuelan food, and the sister gelato place next door is even better. Tip: The food is way more filling than it looks. Order slowly. And then go next door and try some lavendar gelato. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Experience + least likely to think of Venezuelan Food when traveling to Vegas. Love the concept! Arepas were so flavorful + they even offer wood fired meats.  Authentic, Considerate food served here. Love it!"}
{"text":"tip:  get an arepa, then cross the street to get some frozen custard!  At around $4, it's somewhat pricey for a rather small but plenty tasty arepa.  Beef tongue arepas were very tender, but was cooked through so much that you won't know its beef tongue or beef brisket. comes with green sauce which was fantastic.  also have sugar cane drinks (asians love that $h!t)"}
{"text":"First let me say yummy! If you don't know what arepas are, don't be afraid to try them. This place has some really great food.  I tried the chicken and one with black beans, pork, plantains and cheese. They are about the size of a street taco but 4x as filling. They look like an empanada but they are fluffier. I can't forget to mention the sauces! They give you 3 bottles of sauces for the arepas and they are the perfect topping for these. My favorite was the avocado/cilantro/ranch sauce. I bought 2 and ate half of each and was pretty full. The prices are super reasonable 4-7$ per arepa. The restaurant was pretty big and seemed pretty busy even at the early lunch hour I was there. If you're in the downtown area and want to try something new, different and delicious, I highly recommend giving this place a visit, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good service, very nice place and convenient location. But very small portions. Snack size food and it's too pricey for what it is I'm sorry."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm eating my yuca fries with chicharrones. SOO GOOD. I also got the ground beef arepa. ALSO SOO GOOD. Definitely recommend for something low cost in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is so small I mistakenly walked into Dino's bar instead!  This was my first time trying Arepas which are from Venezuela.   The menu is very simple and the place is a little shack. The outside temperature was near 115* and you can only dine outside on stools. I felt sorry for the cook BC it was too hot eating outside  so kudos to the chef inside over a hot grill without AC!   My order -1 lengua Arepas and 1 shredded beef Arepas. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the Arepas. The outside pocket tasted similar to masa around a tamale. The inside filling of beef reminded me of a stew flavor and the tongue filing was minced up and not gamy but flavorful.  The green hot sauce they give you in a bottle gives the Arepas a nice spicy kick and was yummy.   I'm a new fan of this place but next time I'll return late night instead of mid day."}
{"text":"I was kidnapped and drug to this place. Then I thanked my assailent for introducing me to Arepas. This place is almost a must eat for me know. If I didn't have so many must eats while in Vegas this would definately make the list. The meat the put in the Arepas is great. I enjoyed my whole meal though I prob woudl not order the asada fries again. I would suggest you give this place a try while in Vegas if you like a new experience or love Venezouling food."}
{"text":"Great great great!!!!  The wood grilled chicken is delicious. The aioli sauce is the best and should be smothered on everything!"}
{"text":"Pound for pound one of the greatest spots in all of Vegas. In the hallway that runs beside the kitchen is stacked wood that they use to grill the chicken, and when you taste the chicken you are instantly knocked out by that amazing smokey flavor. It's a marvel of simple, perfect, pure flavor. The arepas themselves are equally great, especially the pork and chicken (IMHO). Be careful though. You will think you need to order two or three because they are so cheap, but you won't be able to finish even a second. They are STUFFED with ingredients, and the masa-based dough is mighty heavy. These are gut bombs of the highest order. You'll be hard pressed to find a greater value anywhere. Food this impeccable should not be this cheap."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I'm Colombian and I love to support Latin Business, but I got treated like shit at this place like I was begging for food or something.  It was a bald man giving me attitude like he hated his job. Food was alright. There is better Venezuelan food like Rica Arepa Express!"}
{"text":"Arepas are amazing, and Viva Las Arepas makes some delicious ones. I'm not sure there is much more to say about it. I've taken several groups of friends to Viva Las Arepas, and they have always enjoyed it. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I spotted this place on our way to Fremont Street and Yelpers sold me on it! The place is cozy and a nice break from the chaos of the strip. Pork, chicken, and beef were all so tender, juicy, and piled high. The arepas are amazing on their own but the sauces are pretty dang good. Friendly people, modest prices, and homemade flavors will be why we will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Clean, not crazy busy, and the food really was quite authentic."}
{"text":"La reina pepiada is my all time fave I get this at least a couple times a month if not more, that green creamy sauce omgggg, I have a thing for sauces and salsa, this is one of my all time favorites."}
{"text":"My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!  I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.     An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.  SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out.   #5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!  #7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full.   The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.    This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food   Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk. Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping! Ear ~ Cars cars cars! Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas! Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!"}
{"text":"Not really sure how to describe this place, as I had never ventured into a Venezuelan restaurant before.  The food is amazing, the service is amazing, the meal on day two (since day one was so good) was even better than day 1.    I am in love with the food here, and look forward to being back in a few days.  The roasted chicken - fyi - is so good you'll slap your momma!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I try to come here at least once a month. If we lived closer we would come here more often. Our usual order... a wood fire chicken arepa with cheese & avocado and we share a side salad. Soooo yummy & addictive! :)  Ingredients are fresh & homemade, the restaurant is clean and spacious with indoor & outdoor seating and the owner and staff are always helpful & friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  If I had to pick one place to eat for the rest of my life or my last meal, this place would be it.  Authentic Venezuelan cuisine in a mom and pop shop atmosphere. Cheap food and some of the best service I've had.  You order at the counter. There's plenty of seating inside and there's also an outside patio.  Open until midnight every night. My favorite is the cachapas Arepas. If you love corn bread and cheese, this is something that will be right up your alley."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. I had the beans, rice, chicken, plantains, and empanadas. Literally everything was amazing. I paid a total of 15 with tip for my meal."}
{"text":"These are best arepas I've had! Although these are hard to split/share, I'd recommend it because there wasn't an arepa I didn't like."}
{"text":"I would have enjoyed my first Venezuelan sammich more if I weren't so hungover.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the Turkey Pastrami & Cheese Arepa until the bread got soggy... and the view of the strip club across the street. I liked my friend's super loaded and savory Garlic Shrimp Arepa better though... I'll order that next time.   - Ideal for a quick snack or to-go, since this little shack really is a glorified food truck. - Plastic is accepted, but bring ca$h if you're only ordering one item, since all the arepas are between $3 - $5. - I guess the juices are made from fresh fruit (yay!), because guava wasn't in stock the day I went (boo!) - No clearly defined parking spaces - we parked right by the shack - Misters out front kept our skin hydrated in the scorching heat"}
{"text":"We were cruising down Las Vegas Blvd wondering what to eat. We came across this gem of a restaurant. Never had Venezuelan food so we decided to try it.  The wood fire beef arepas was out of this world.  Prices are very reasonable too.  Will go there again"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Can't wait until the next time to explore the menu. The service was amazing, in addition to the authenticity of the Venezuelan culture."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I have been here several times after reading about it in las vegas weekly. the food is to perfection everytime! the prices are amazing for this type of quality of food. i LOVEEEE the sauce that they serve on the side of the arepas. they are to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan food. Randomly discovered while driving to get luv-it custard by the stratosphere a couple years ago. The price for each arepa is a little steep, especially if you add cheese and avocado, but it's well worth the price. The size is a good portion. My first time, I ate 2 and was too full. The carne asada and roasted pork butt are delicious. Extremely flavorful. The corn bun just melts in your mouth, while the meat is seasoned and juicy. The empanadas are great also. Nice hidden gem on the strip/yet off the strip."}
{"text":"better, more authentic venezuelan arepas than most i've had in the state.  mechado and pork butt were good.  my usual favorite, reinas pepiadas, had too much cilantro."}
{"text":"This place is such a great find. Delicious and authentic arepas and friendly staff. We loved the black bean and cheese, ham and cheese and cachapa arepa and finished it off with mango juice. Delicious !! Can't wait to come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! The place is clean and nice. I had fried yucca,carne arepa,chicken, platanos,coconut pastry and a passion fruit drink. I loved everything.My husband is picky and he loved everything too.Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Colorful busy little place with great Venzuluan food. Newly opened, this place will be a hit. Can't wait to get back there. Try their pork butt with rice and black beans."}
{"text":"Excelente comida, muy sana, el lugar muy aseado, excelente atención, super recomendado chef Pedro."}
{"text":"Let just say my appetite was araped. But it was consensual so... that is just something to think about. I hope no one is offended by that... and if you are well... whatever.  So this place was really good. How often do I eat arepas you ask? never. This was my first time and they are really delicious... i wish i remember the ones I liked but... i tried every single one!! avoid the ones with tomatoes i remember not liking those... also I dont like long walks on the beach.  The meat flavoring is really delicious. All of the empanadas are good... but especially the bean one.... OMGG (double G). So i strongly recommend eating it. also buying 80 dollars worth of food get them to treat you really well... but that is buying everything on the menu.  It is a great place to try.   THE VERDICT: Well... let me think for a second... do you like venezuela... if you say no you are a racist so... go get some arepas or you are a racist. its science. I really enjoyed it, if you are in the area hit it up. Also its next to a bails bond thing so... if someone gets arrested... you got some yummy arepas and freedom."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  It's been awhile since I have had an authentic arepa, and it was spot on!  I had the wood fire beef one and it was delicious.  Prices are reasonable too.  I'm definitely adding this place to my rotation while in Vegas."}
{"text":"At the moment I'm going to rate 3-STARS only because not only is this my first visit to VIVA LAS AREPAS but my first AREPA.  \"Don't judge me, I'm a AREPA VIRGIN\"  Before the upgraded location I would pass the stand at least 4x's a week.  But it never called out to me: \"c'mon dee, you know you want to try one, just one.  pull the car over dee, you won't be disappointed\" Needless to say that conversation never happened.  So the other day I was watching Triple D and Guy Fieri was at a restaurant named VALENCIA LUNCHERIA and the chef made REINA PEPIADA.  I can't lie, it looked so delicious my mouth to started to water (stop laughing).  So I told myself that I will make a trip to VIVA LAS AREPAS.  I'm not quite sure about this, but I think they've been here in Las Vegas for at least 5yrs.  It's VEGAS, longevity does not come easy in this town.  OK, so enough of the introduction to this review, let's get to the REAL:  I order the REINA PEPIADA w/ a side order of handcut shortstrings.  I promise no disrespect to the Venezuelan culture, this reminds me of a TORTA. I didn't say it taste like a torta, its just reminiscent of a torta (its the san diegan in me)  FOOD:  AREPA shredded chicken breast w/ avocado and cilantro, accompanied w/ a creamy cilantro dressing and salsa.  the AREPA itself is grilled to a light brown, giving a nice crust w/ crunch.  the chicken breast is mixed together w/ the avocado and cilantro. (creamy chicken salad style)  super light and dense, nice crunch when you bite into it.  the chicken is not under/over cooked nor seasoned.  perfect amount of spice, topping the AREPA w/ the salsa is the KICKER.  OMG, the salsa by itself delicious, it has the kind of heat that does not hit you right away, the heat kicks in at the back of the throat.  Mmm, Mmm, Mmm that shizzy is FIRE!  the creamy cilantro dressing I did not dress my AREPA w/ it for the avocado covered that for me.   FRENCH FRIES i will pass on these, maybe because I got it to go my fries were soggy.....ok, no that's not going to work for me.  I'M JUST SAYING there is another well known establishment that offers handcut fries and they always make it to the house w/ crisp.   Arepas are reasonably priced, the most \"expensive\" arepa on the menu is $6.00 (Shrimp and Garlic arepa).  The fries are nothing fantastic, there are alternatives to the fries: fried plantains of fried yucca root.  There are other things that I would like to try on this menu, so I will be making a couple of more visit to experience the other Venezuelan delights on this menu.   SUN -THU: open til 10pm FRI-SAT: open til MIDNIGHT   TRY THEM OUT, I'M GOING BACK ;-)"}
{"text":"Word is starting to spread about I Love Arepas and boy oh boy does it live up to all the buzz it's receiving. At a little less than $4 a pop, you're going to end up walking away from this food stand with a mouth full of smiles and belly full of happy.  If you asked me what an arepa was a few hours ago, I'd reply back with a blank stare and a scratch of the head. Ask me this in the present, and you'll find me blindingly reciting the Wikipedia description word-for-word, while dual-wielding an arepa in each hand.  The arepa is basically a fried flat cornmeal based sandwich filled generously with a meat of choice. Here, at I Love Arepas,  they have all of the usual meats that you'd find at a taco shop (beef, carne asada, shredded chicken/beef, tripe, lengua, etc.), along with their own unique concoctions.   Since it was my first visit I was recommended these two items: *#1 Carne Mechada - Shredded beef, bell pepper, onions, tomato, garlic *#7 Reina Pepiada - Shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise,  cilantro, green peas  I'd say that the #7 came out the winner in this one, but the carne mechada was at a close second due to how meaty it was (shredded beef lovers rejoice!). My mouth is flooding with drool now that I'm recalling what I ordered just a few minutes ago. I'm going to make it a mission to try every item on their menu. Before you know it, I'll be a stuffed, wobbling arepa machine by the time I'm through with it.  One downside about I Love Arepas is that it's located in Stabbytown, USA. The area isn't the greatest. If you've been to Luv It Frozen Custard (across the street), you'd know what I mean. If hobos don't scare you, give I Love Arepas a shot without hesitation. If the common-day bearded hobo does give you the willies, bring a friend along with you and share the love."}
{"text":"I have long avoided this place for two reasons: one, I despise the food truck trend. And two, my previous experience with arepas was limited to some mystery-meat-stuffed weirdness at a bus depot in the Venezuelan hinterlands.  But yesterday, as I was driving past the street corner where the Arepa boys do business...out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the proprietors were two hot Venezuelan dudes of childbearing age. Hell-O! I did a quick U-turn and pulled into the parking lot.   As mentioned, my previous experience with arepas left me skeptical...but the hotness of the staff, and the fact that it's not actually a food truck, but more of a dingy kiosk unadorned with Twitter and Facebook logos, convinced me to give 'em a second try. And now.......... I, too, Love Arepas!  I only had one -- the bean and cheese. But it was fantastic!! WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot). At $3.50 it was a filling mini-meal...and actually stuck to my ribs through three cocktails, preventing me from getting wasted and doing embarrassing things down on Fremont St.  IMO this is hands down the best dining in all of Vegas -- cheap, unpretentious, delicious and al fresco. You can sit at the little tables in front of the arepa pod and enjoy the scenery of the neighborhood: a strip club, a dive bar and an all-night drugstore patronized by pimps and weirdos.   I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming here again and again and again -- and that's just with the hot proprietors. I'll come to the kiosk again, too :-)"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I ate in Vegas during this last trip and the most affordable. The plantains were sweet and fabulous. Best plantains I have ever eaten. The pork butt arepa was delicious with the green sauce. Also the shrimp one was even better. I loved the fresh juices the most- so refreshing and not too sweet. I will definitely be back to try more next time."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since they moved out of the Dino's parking lot. It's a shame, because it is really good.   For my money, the carne asada arepa, with egg and cheese added, is the money order. I also had their fried plantains for the first time, which were definitely interesting. I enjoyed them, but could see how they might not be everyone's cup of tea.   There was about a 10 minute wait, but I didn't mind it all that much. It meant that everything was cooked fresh.   The arepas look small but they are deceivingly filling. They cost between $5.50 and $7 each, which is pretty decent for what you get.   Overall, great little unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check out Viva las Arepas for a long time now. I read that they recently moved to a larger location so we decided to check it out.   Both my friend and I ordered an arepa de reina pepiada, a sort of chicken salad filling, with avocado mayo dressing and a meat empenada, since two arepas would've have been too much food. I also ordered a mango water, which was very refreshing and not too sweet. Both the arepa and the empanada were very tasty.  The foos in itself is merits a four star review, and although I am hsistant, I am giving them three stars becaus eboth my friend and I felt ill afterwards. I know a lot goes into getting sick from food, veryone's digestive system if different. With that said, I can eat anywhere and I've never gotten sick.  My friend seems to think it was the salsa they gave us on the side, she says it seemed a bit off, more vinegar-y than it should be.   Regardless, as I said the food was really good so I am definitely planning on coming back and letting the management know about the sauce. I am sure it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the Reina Pepiada.   We came in on a Sunday before noon and the place was quiet. The staff took considerable time explaining the dishes including making recommendations regarding adding cheese or avocado. I found them both cheerful and helpful.  We tried the following... Arepas: Chicken Pork Reina Pepiada  Empanada: Guava (and mozzarella)  Drink: Soursop"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while running errands.  Ordered the carne asada arepa, shredded chicken empanada, and a taqueno(home made cheese stick).  The arepa was awesome.  The corn cake like outside was crispy and they stuff it with your choice of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion,  and cheese and avocado are extra.  The empanada was made of the same corn dough, the chicken on the inside was good.  The taqueno was the corn dough wrapped around a stick of mozzarella and then fried.    Everything was very good.  Will be back to try some different menu items like the chicharrons and yuca frites."}
{"text":"Bigger does not always mean better. Seriously, why did they have to change things when they moved to a larger space, down the street?  Before my husband gave it to me, he said \"Do you want the good news or the bad news?\" Not a nice opener. He followed it up with the owner saying the menu was changed. I was so looking forward to getting my chicken arepa yesterday for lunch while watching my game on tv. Well, the chicken was totally different- I get grossed out when I am pulling out pieces of cartilege, then I finally took off the chicken and just ate the corn part. My husband's beef arepa was super salty, good flavor, but dang the saltiness was really high. He likes salt but he didn't finish it, so I threw it out (I can't eat that).   On top of all this, the prices got higher. Such a disappointment. I don't know if anyone else feels the same."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. I can only eat one thing on the menu but it's very good. The veggie arepas without cheese. It's good, have to have it on my \"cheat days\" they charge 50 cents for a cup of water... Find that annoying. It's just like a fast food place. Order at the counter & pick up your food when it's ready. I would come back for the arepas."}
{"text":"first time trying this, my son had been here before. It was so good, I wish there was one closer to home. I had the #7 which was chicken, avocado and mayo cilantro. The BOMB....we also had their version of mozzarilla sticks, Tequeno Pastelito. The cachapa is really good, tastes like sweet cornbread tortilla filled with cheese. Chicken was grilled and flavored and the beef fries were tasty.  Place was clean, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas has come far, starting off as a little shack in a strip mall or parking lot area of somewhere that I can't recall. It was back several years ago when they first opened that I tried their arepas and wasn't too impressed at that time.   I had the pork butt arepa this time along with the cachapa. Both were quite amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the exterior of the arepa in general, but the pork butt was marinated to perfection and with the green sauce it went well together.   The cachapa I got was a bit undercooked, but, I donated it to my coworkers and they were quite blown away, given that it was their first time they had tasted anything like it. I'll definitely be back to try several of their items again, as their menu is now vast with so many options!"}
{"text":"This place is HEAVEN in a pocket! I LOVE Arepas #7! It is one of the best on the go meals I have ever had!   The Empanadas are delicious as well!  The sauces are addictive... I put that stuff on everything I order!   The staff is friendly and take pride in their work. The place is clean and cute!   I will go back there every chance I get and will tell everyone I know about it!   YUM! YUM! YUM!"}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood scare you away! The place is a great place for a date. Cheap, fun, makes you seem like a true cultured foodie. I recommend getting the reina pepiada; however, I may be biased with my love for avocado. The yukka root tastes like french fries, but better. Eat them with the green and white sauce!  Water cups cost 50 cents! Parking lot is not very big.  End your date with a stop at the gelato place next door :)"}
{"text":"4. Roasted pork butt 1. Wood fired shredded chicken. The pork is just pork with tomatoes. Extra 99 cents for avocado, but the pork is so well flavored I don't think it needs it.  Wood fired shredded chicken- comes with lettuce. Pay the 99 cents for avocado. It's not as flavored, but with the avocado it's just as good as the number 4.  Bigger, cleaner location than the Las Vegas blvd location. They have a huge table that can fit your 10+ group.  Order online and pick up! Don't forget to pick up sauce.. neither are spicy. The light green is my favorite!"}
{"text":"As I was passing through Vegas, I needed something quick but also something different. I found this place on Yelp and it looked intriguing. Came here on a Sunday around 5 and it wasn't crowded. I decided to order an arepa with carne asada, tomatoes and lettuce (#1) and one with the shredded chicken and avocado (#7). I was not disappointed at all by my choices. The wood fire beef was cooked well and the meat was very flavorful. The chicken was also flavorful, moist, and creamy inside. I really liked that it was like a torta but the \"bun\" was made of corn. I was scared that buying only 2 of them wasn't going to be enough, but it fills you up fast. We also shared the chicharron with yucca fries and the fried plantains. The chicharron was fried well and fresh while the plantains were sweet but not overly oily. According to Yelp, everyone really likes the sauces here. They give you 2 bottles, one which is a creamy spicy sauce while the other one is a verde green sauce. The creamy sauce was great with all of them while the verde salsa was fairly typical of most Latino restaurants. Overall I thought the food was super good here. I would definitely come back here in a heart beat when going through Vegas. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the prices. I thought $5-$7 was a tad steep for what you're actually getting. Don't get me wrong, it was really good, but to get pretty full, you'll probably end up spending $10-$12, which isn't bad at all, just not as cheap as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service!  We went for a late lunch on Sunday.  It was busy but there were plenty of available seats.  I ordered a beef and a Reina Pepiada arepa!  The Reina Pepiada was filled with a delicious cold chicken salad with a cilantro mayo dressing. The arepa was hot with a slightly crunchy crust - I devoured it.  The arepas were served with two bottles of sauce, one creamy cilantro and a super hot, make you sweat, sauce.  Luckily, I had a delicious Passion Fruit juice! And to the service - bravo!  The man behind the counter noticed me looking around (at my table) and asked me if I needed anything.  They promptly brought a fork to my table!  I was too full for the beef arepa so they packaged it to go - with two small sauces.  I have used that spicy sauce for two meals - YUMMY!  Can't wait to go back for the food and excellent friendly service!"}
{"text":"So tasty so good can't describe the taste of it try it amazing Venezuela food. So gooooooooooooood!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! my food is delicious! I don't write reviews but I had to write this one. I had a chicken empanada and a chicken arepas . my boyfriend had the half chicken with black beans and rice all with wood grilled chicken. when I tell you it was all delicious I mean scrumptous. and the service was awesome. I definitely recommend it! I will come here everytime I visit. as a matter of fact we might make special trips..."}
{"text":"Generously stuffed Arepas, unless you're really hungry, one should satisfy even the most hungry Las Vegas gambler.  Friendly service, a clean environment and air conditioning greeted our party of 4 on a hot July evening.  While there were not many patrons at the time, we knew we were in for a treat as Viva Las Arepas had been listed in the recent \"Best of Las Vegas\" article, it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Woah. Number 4 without tomatoes, add avocado, with a side of fried plantains and a water. It was served with 2 sauces, one salsa verde and the other I don't remember but that verde is SPICY GOOD! The shredded, roasted pig butt was so flavorful with the avocado and corn exterior, my mouth is already watering for another one. The fried plantains are good too. I don't know what to try next but I can't wait!! A definite hotspot in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I can yelp that hasn't already been yelped about Arepas. But alas I have to write a review if I want to add Arepas to a list (a few lists, really) of favorites.   I really haven't eaten a wide spectrum of arepas. I've had the veggie ($4) and camarones al ajillo ($5). The veggie is just meh, but the camarones with the side sauces is so good.   I guess it also helps that when I go, I'm normally hopped up on vodka and Danny G's karaoke from Dino's (shares a parking lot with Dino's). When I'm in that state, I have no discrimination filter and I love all food.   These tasty little pockets are yummy, but a little on the pricey side for the portion sizes. Though I've heard, but have no confirmation, that the corn meal is imported straight from Venezuela. Who knows. It sounds nice, though. So take your time and savor the taste and texture of the cornmeal pocket. So yummy.   You can also get tasty beverages like guanabana ($1.75)  to wash down your arepa. Wonderful.   Friendly staff."}
{"text":"- First time here was 2 years ago in 2014. Coming back this year, I was welcomed by the familiar owner of Viva Las Arepas  - Friendly server and owner. They enjoy chatting and are accommodating to your requests. We asked for some ice water to be refilled in our water bottles and our wishes were granted  - A wide variety of Arepas (Beef, Chicken, Pork, Seafood, Vegetarian, etc). Our personal recommendation is roasted beef"}
{"text":"I came in here for a quick bite to eat after driving in from Reno and I have to say,  it was delicious,  I'll definitely be back again before I leave."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, and although my first time eating Arepas, it was extremly tasty.  Would recommend you give it a shot!"}
{"text":"In my taste buds opinions this place rules the roost and Felix along with his staff are the best at cooking and being great people. My favorite thing to eat there is the #7 Reina Pepiada, which is a shredded chicken breast salad, made with avocado, mayo, cilantro and peas.It is definitely the star on the menu, but the carne mechada, pork butt (pernil) and the bean and cheese arepas are also great. But I've had 90% of the menu and have never  been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is very small but packs a huge flavorful punch to your taste buds! Made me an instant fan! I had the #1 carne machado, beef empanada & the coconut with cheese pastelito. I also tried the guava & cheese pastelito, that thing was amazing! I loved every morsel of all the good food I was able to try."}
{"text":"I was visiting LV for a conference (stayed at the LVH) and wanted to eat away from the strip and downtown for a change. Luckily, I spotted this place from a taxi ride on the way to Fremont days earlier. So glad I did! I've sampled arepas made by Venezuelan friends, and the ones I got tasted exactly the same. The chicken with avocado and shredded beef...simple, wonderful. Next time, I'll skip the cheese on the chicken (cheese slice just sits there between warm corn arepa and cool filling, and for me, would have been better off without).  On top of the great food, the owner went above and beyond. He called a taxi for us and walked outside a few times to make sure we'd get the cab; what a nice, nice man. One of the best meals, and service, we received over the course of a 4 day work trip."}
{"text":"You have to try this place! Been to their two locations a couple times, and their food is amazingly good. They have very friendly customer service, they are pretty fast and inexpensive. I usually get one arepa, share an appetizer and this gets me satisfied. The carne asada, reina pepiada, meat empanadas, and arepa cachapa are my favorites!!!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Good portion size, very stuffed! Around 5$ each. The guy at the register was very nice and provided great customer service. We got a carne asada arepa, chicken and ham with cheese arepa. I need to go back and try different ones."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I eat here everytime I'm in Vegas. This time the owner Felix stopped me at the door and told me that I did not look like a \"customer\" and didn't want me there. I seriously thought I was on a hidden camera prank show. He said \"you don't look like a customer\" and \"you people come in here and act a type of way\". I was alone and thought he'd mistaken me for a previous patron. I asked him if he was joking about the \"you people\" and the \"you don't look like a customer\" comments. I told him that I dine there all the time. He said \"you need to understand that I'm a business owner and I don't want certain people in here\". Shocked, I went to the restroom to call my husband so he could hear what was happening. I then went to place my order and the same man now behind the counter said \"what's your name\"? I told him my name (still in shock and waiting for cameramen to jump out). I asked his name and he said \"Felix and I'm the owner\".  As he rang me up he said \"sorry about earlier but you people really can be a type of way\". I'd had enough at that point and said \"had you not treated me with such a discriminatory tone I would have spend my money here\". I walked out, still on the phone with my husband, and I went to the clothing store next door. After being in there for 5-8 mins Felix walked in and processed to harass me in the store next door!! I shit you not!! I have several witness. I seriously recommend that people who \"don't look like customers\" or fall into the category of \"you people\" to dine elsewhere. Horrible experience nonetheless I will continue to enjoy, just Arepas someplace else. Hey Felix..go Google the racist Starbucks incident. You may learn something. Anyone else who experience this type of harassment from this place to please message me."}
{"text":"We ate here on our last day in Vegas. We'd passed the I heart Arepas sign every time we made our way up and down the strip. After we returned from our Hoover Dam tour we marched here from the old strip. It was delicious. We had the shrimp and chicken arepas, with a few drinks. What a great treat in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"If you are looking for one hell of an arepa, I can't recommend this place enough. They were very good, very cheesy and tasty. Not the healthiest of options but I highly recommend if you are treating yourself."}
{"text":"Electrolytes are important when one is in Las Vegas. All that boozing and partying will zap the essential vitamins and minerals from your body.  The arepas that this joint makes will have lots of electrolytes because they are overloaded with salt; and it looks like the heavy salt hand was not a one time incident as other fellow Yelpers also mention the non phenomenon.  Arepa was extra doughy on the inside and not in a good way. Cooking a proper arepa takes a very long time, 15-20 minutes. I prefer my arepas to be fully cooked, through and through.   Bummed that these Arepas were inedible. The smokey flavor of the mesquite wood on the meat was awesome and I could still taste the subtleties of the smoke flavor behind the heavy mask of the salt.   Possibly excellent food is ruined by sloppy execution"}
{"text":"Wood fire beef arepa was delicious. Spring for the sour cream and avocado. We also got the yucca fries which were also yummy with the green sauce. Try this place you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place has great arepas, we always stop here when we go to Vegas. They have clearly labeled vegetarian options and their vegetarian arepa is actually vegan as there's no dairy in it. I believe most of the side dishes are vegan as well. I also got white rice and black beans, the beans are not only vegan but very flavorful! Their prices are also reasonable and perfect for people on a gluten free diet too since arepas are made from corn. They have two homemade sauces, if you are vegan you can have the green sauce instead of the guasacaca sauce which has dairy in it."}
{"text":"First time trying Venezuelan food and it was delicious. I got the Fire steak  and pork butt Arepas  with rice and beans.  I love the wood fire taste and the salsas were amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Made to ordered goodness everything was so fresh. Highly recommend the smoked chicken arepa and garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm Arepas..... My first experience with Arepas was here and I'm definitely a fan. Love the doughy flatbread the meat/shrimp/veggies comes in, it's crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside (yum!). My favorite filling is wood fired shredded chicken with avocado and garlic shrimp. Both are great. The also have a variety of other fillings and even a vegetarian version. You can add cheese, avocado, and now egg to any arepa.  The shredded chicken empanadas and guava and cheese pastelitos are great too. I tend to crave arepas and pastelitos now and then and always come here. I've never been disappointed.  The staff is very friendly and patient, even when I stare at the menu for 20 minutes thinking I'll order something new and still get what I was craving."}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas is awesome! Arepas are life. I love the deliciously crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside bread. The best part is that they are stuffed with a variety of deliciousness.  My favorites are Wood Fired Shredded Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, and Pabellon - beef, beans, plantains, and cheese. Pabellon sounds like a weird combination, right? It is fantastic! Bursting in flavors. I also enjoy their empenadas and pastelitos. Specifically the shredded chicken empanada and guava and cheese pastelito. I've also tried the half chicken plate that was good but I missed the Arepas when I got it. Having one Arepa will fill you but if you're greedy like me, you probably wont settle on one. So?!"}
{"text":"First time having an arepa, and oh my god it was like heaven in my mouth.   I got the wood fire chicken arepa with avacado added, although it was not really nessisary since the meat and bread that holds it are super moist and they give you such yummy sauces to add to it.  The flavors were bold and complex and I have a new favorite place. We also got the shredded beef empanadas, which were also very rich and satisfying. Way more filling than I thought they would be for the size.  I also got a side of plantains and they were yummy and carmalized from the cooking process. Everything I got tasted good in the sauces they gave me, even the plantains. God I want to take these sauces home!    The location is right next to art of flavors, which was our original destination.  However it wasn't open yet until 1, so when I realized one of my book marks was next door and smelled the amazingness that was coming from here, I had to try. I am so glad I did.  Just a heads up they have outside seating as well."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  We checked this little food stand out after our friend raved about it and mentioned that it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.    I ordered the Chicken (Pollo Mechado) Arepas and the Beef Empanada.  I ate the empanada in the car and it was definitely fresh and hot (so hot I burned the roof of my mouth on it) ;(   We waited until getting back to the hotel to have the Arepas.  Tip: make sure you have wet wipes and a lot of extra napkins....there is no pretty way to eat this bad boy!  While it was definitely flavourful, and filled with meat (you definitely get your money's worth), I found it way too filling. Also, by the time we got back to the hotel, the arepa had sadly gone soggy.  But the accompanying sauces were great toppers.    Value wise - it's a great value. $4 for a whole lotta meat!  And only $2 for the empanada.    That said, I almost feel bad about giving Viva Las Arepas a 3.5 rating, after seeing all the great reviews here.  I will definitely give Viva Las Arepas a chance again upon my next Vegas visit, and this time, I will make sure to enjoy my arepas right away."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here, and it was so good! I got the #7, I think it was called the reina. You get full off one, & they are decent priced as well. I also tried one other item, it was like corn bread with cheese, also good! I didn't know what to expect but I was satisfied! I didn't catch his name but the guy working there was extremely friendly & valued the customers. Clean restaurant. On my next trip back to Vegas I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Not much I can add that hasn't already been said. just dang good food and a nice clean place. been a few times already and will return a few more."}
{"text":"A regular haunt of Friday-nite Aruba Swings patrons a few doors down, Viva Las Arepas fueled dancers needs for good food and energy. Having been both to their old shack location, and their now storefront location, their arepas are wonderfully delicious and filling. The guy at the counter always laughed at (with) me when I ordered since I can't pronounce it right, but I get the veggie arepa and the cold arepa with chicken and avocado. The wait isn't long, and they make it when you order it. Better than fast food! Try their mango and passionfruit drinks too!"}
{"text":"A small shack on the strip with about 5 tables on the sidewalk.  The arepas are about $4-5 each.  I got a hot beef and cheese and a cold chicken and avocado.  I loved the beef because it was hot/warm and the arepa bun was also hot and tasted good hot.  The cold one was meh.  The chicken and avocado was a good combo, but the arepa bun was like eating a corn tortilla right out of the plastic bag.  It needed some heat on the corn meal to make it softer.  I wouldn't get a cold one again, but the hot ones are really good and worth it."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to the strip. I would eat every meal of the weekend here if I could. It is definitely a must try if you are visiting Vegas especially since food gets so pricey on the strip with all these chef restaurants and what not. If you are looking for some messy but delectable eats, this is your stop.  I ordered the garlic shrimp and the shredded beef with cheese. I wouldn't get the garlic shrimp again because it didn't have enough flavor for me, even though it was still a great choice, I also needed to add alot of their green sauce and I felt like it wasn't worth it if I had to douse it in sauce. The shredded beef on the other hand... whole 'nother experience. The rich and succulent flavor of the beef paired with the perfect amount of cheese, a dab of their green sauce, and their hearty corn flour exterior... man oh man you are missing out if you haven't had this. The juice/oil from the meat was leaking from the arepa but I really wasn't mad because I just kept licking my hands (#shameless). Since it is made from corn flour it tends to be heavier and therefore I got filled faster so just a heads up that it might be excessive if you want two, unless you can handle that life then all power to you!   So glad I stopped by and can't wait to re-visit and try new arepas. Great service and ample seating, although I am sure it gets packed I was there at a fairly dull time (9:30PM). Must eat when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ay dios mio!!  This place is amaze balls! Tiny little pouches of yummy greasy goodness.  Its the PERFECT hangover food or if you're just in the mood for something naughty but different.  This little hole in the wall is right across from the OG.  If the weather is nice, take a seat outside.  I've had the shredded beef, chicken, pork, and lengua arepas and they are delicious!  Most people order 2 or 3, but I find myself full with just one...and of course an empanada. Service is fantastic and this place is usually poppin so plan to wait a bit for this little taste of Venezuela.  Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I was so excited to finally get a chance to try this place!  After several failed attempts (due to hangover induced comas), I finally struggled to get to I love Arepas (which is located next to a bar near the stratosphere casino/resort) to try as many of the arepas as possible on two consecutive trips (end of Sept 2011 and Halloween 2011).    I will start with the two sauces offered.  One is a tomatillo based, spicy salsa.  The other is a crema/avocado based sauce.  Both are freaking like crack and would go delicious on a shoe.  On to the main show.  I have had a chance to fully consume or try bites of the following (and remember, I am a fat ass at heart and am not ashamed):   1. Shredded Beef 2. Shredded Chicken 3. Beef Tongue 5. Roasted Pork Butt 7. Riena Pepiada 8. Garlic Shrimp  This place is legit and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my hands down favorites were the #1 Shredded Beef and the #7 Riena Pepiada (especially this one, it is addictively good).  In all honesty, if you are staying anywhere near the Las Vegas strip, order a cab and pay the $10 to get here and eat the delicious ass food.  One more note:  don't be fooled by the size of the arepas; they are really filling.  You can easily eat one, but two may make you explode.  I recommend coming with a group of 4-6, ordering a bunch of different arepas, and trying things family style."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. If you are in a hurry this is probably not the best choice for you. It's clean and the staff is friendly. I like the chicken thighs and of course the Arepas are always yummy."}
{"text":"The people are nice and friendly. The menu had everything I want arepas empanadas and they also had items off the grill. Really great food definitely the spot to go to !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Venezuelan food I've ever had in Las Vegas. Quality food made by quality people. The staff is great and food is to die for. This place is definitely on my top best places to eat in Las Vegas.   Recommendations: Everything!"}
{"text":"Cheeeeeese empanada.  Yes the arepas are good, but I dream about the cheese empanada.  Crispy and hot and melty.  Yummmmm.  Also had the pork arepa, the chicarones, and the yuca fries.  All were good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food!  The food is so good that I sometimes think about these arepas during random times of the day.  Everything is pretty fresh, hot and delicious!    One negative is eating out there in the heat.  It's hot.  If it is summertime try to come when the sun is down or you will fry."}
{"text":"Located behind the Stratosphere, Viva Las Arepas is worth visiting over and over.   Everything on their menu sounds delicious, but on my visit I was 'only' able to try the Wood Fired Chicken Arepa, Reina Pepiada Arepa, Guava and Coconut pastries.  The Reina Arepas was my fav and the sweet good were amazing.  Will have to return to try everything else.  Looking forward to additional locations opening up.  If I had to describe an arepa, it's like a dense english muffin pocket made from grits.  It is a lovely home for anything savory."}
{"text":"This popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings. Located in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite. The restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent. We ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries. In seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night. Viva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa."}
{"text":"My 5 stars says it all. Pictures others posted here did not tweek their photos. Their food whether you order soup, arepas, plantains, yucca, empinadas, etc...looks delicious and sure tastes delicious. You have got to try it!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and of a reasonable price! The arepas may look small, but they are actually quite filling and PACKED with contents in each one. Ranges anywhere from $5-8 per arepas - two of them would make a very solid meal. I would highly recommend any of the ones indicated on the menu as \"Chef's Recommendations\", especially the one with fried plantains (#12, Pabellon). This place is located off the strip, but it has a convenient parking lot and it's easy to get to. Gets decently crowded during dinner hours, but luckily there are many tables to sit at! Service was good too, and thus had a great experience here!"}
{"text":"I was really really really excited to try this place out because i never had Venezuelan food.  To make sure I tasted a little bit of everything, we ordered the Wood Fire Mix Grill(6) which came with enough rice for one person and fries for two. (not enough  What was most disappointing was how none of the meats were marinated nor had sauce, so all you could taste was how charred it came out.  The Arepas(10) on the other hand are freaking delicious! X) Had the carne one and i cant get enough! Probably the only dish that would give this place 5 star ratings.  I was also impressed with the whole interior color and pictures of their dishes framed on the walls, but there was only one problem... There was no air conditioning!!! I was sweating from the store rather than from the food. :[   Another cuisine down folks! Dont be afraid to try new things, because it just makes life that much more interesting. ;)"}
{"text":"By far my most favorite place to eat when in Vegas the reina pepiada is awesome and the cachapas"}
{"text":"I had never tried arepas before, but I can't imagine them being much better than those at Viva las Arepas. We tried the roasted pork butt arepa with cheese and another arepa with chicken breast and avocado (their most popular). The corn cakes they were served in were some of the best gluten-free concoctions my girlfriend and I have tried since identifying our respective gluten sensitivities. They were cooked throughout and crispy golden brown on the outside with soft fluffy insides. For sides, we shared the fried plantains, perfectly caramelized and cooked through with a little tangy acid to balance the sweet caramelly starch, and the rice with vegetables. The side sauces were great but not really necessary because the food was seasoned and prepared excellently already. As someone who appreciates value and feeling satisfied after a meal, I should add that our dinner was one of the best prepared meals for under $20 I've ever had if it wasn't the very best. Welll done!"}
{"text":"This was a mixed bag, we went in to try venezuelan food. I hated the meat in chicken arepas, I couldn't take more than a bite of , but my wife loved the pork ribs. I think its safe to stick with the grilled food here."}
{"text":"It's a little permanent booth that's open late. There are always happy customers hanging around. The food is really yummy. The first time I ate there it was on a whim on the way home. The next time and every time after was with intent. We've ordered a bunch of different items and everything was tasty. AND you can watch them cook your food. It may be just a little booth, but I wasn't worried that I'd get sick or see the place closed due to a failed health inspection because you can see everything they are doing in the little cooking space. I recommend it for good fast, hot & fresh food."}
{"text":"Another must stop.  I've now tried 90% of the menu and have yet to find something I do not like.  Felix runs a really clean and delicious place, he will take excellent care of you.  Please listen to the staff and take their direction, as it will always turn out better this way, and while you are there forget coke / sprite and try a \"local\" flavor drink.  I look forward to seeing other Yelpers there soon!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Having never had Venezuelan food, but very familiar with other Central and South American cuisines, I had no idea what I was in for. I ended up ordering two arepas because I was very hungry, but still really only needed one. All I know is that I wish there were more of these joints around the country. Not sure when I'll be back in Vegas, but this place will definitely be on my list of returns when I head back!!!"}
{"text":"Second return trip and now at their new location across the street from their former food stand!  This time I met one of the owners, Felix and I  ordered the same shredded beef arepas and this time a Polar (Venezuelan) soda.  Great looking location and still wondering why it is not packed in here. This is truly Las Vegas' hidden gem.   Venezuelan food is one of my favorite cuisines and something that is lacking in Los Angeles -- or I just don't know where to get great arepas other than at Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills. I've had Columbian arepas nearby my place, and it just didn't hit the spot.  My aunt ordered the Venezuelan empanadas this time, but were lacking flavor and bland.  Everything else about the empanada was great and wished the filling had more flavor. This empanada was unlike the many varieties I've tasted -- Filipino, Argentine, Bolvian (all each very unique).   My aunt tried the new wood fired beef arepa and she said that was also very bland -- hopefully they'll kick up the flavors in the empanadas and wood fired beef arepa.   Until then, this five-star review is for...  ... the shredded beef arepas!  This is just how I remember having it in Venezuela, along with the ham and cheese arepas I would have at the airports in Venezuela for breakfast.  Definitely go eat here while in Las Vegas and order the arepa de pabellon (shredded beef)!    Total comfort food here... we even brought a bunch of arepas back home to LA to share with the family."}
{"text":"The arepas are a bit oily with little to no flavor."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Venezuelan cuisine and I was delighted when I stumbled upon this hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Apparently, an arepas is a flatbread made of maize, but I'd liken it to a fried English muffin. Then throw meat inside and you get a delicious snack. They range from 5-7 dollars, and I got Reina Pepiada (chicken breast, mayo, avocado, cilantro) and the Shredded Beef (with bell peppers, onions, tomato). I liked the shredded beef a lot more than the chicken breast, and both are excellent value.   I think this place would be perfect after spending a day at the North Outlets and I would definitely go again. I would really like to try the pork butt next time along with the shredded beef."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying arepas and I loved it!  We ordered their Reina Pepidas and it was delicious!  The sauce that came with the arepas was so delicious!     I haven't gone back since they've moved to a bigger location, so maybe next time,  I'll come back to try different arepas!  Mmmm... I want more of that sauce....."}
{"text":"No. No.... And no. No to the chicken arepa that is served cold, like a chicken salad full of mayo shoved inside two English muffin-esque buns. I made a very bad choice with that one.  Tried the plain cheese arepa as well. Meh. Seriously, it's English muffins stuffed with things! Sorry. I can't get on the band wagon of Yelpers that love this place.  Restaurant itself is clean and tidy. Service is great!   Food is obviously not my cup of tea. My friend had the beef arepa. I wish I had gotten that one... Hummmpphh.  Prices are kind of high IMO. Maybe I'll try it again. Time will tell."}
{"text":"Carne Asada arepa - 4 stars Haven't had good arepas in a while. Carne Asada Arepa is solid choice especially with avocado and cheese on top of it.  It was delicious and would definitely come back here for it.  Customer Service - 4 stars solid customer service and nice people."}
{"text":"what's an arepas? i dunno.   how do you pronounce it? i dunno.   is it a sandwich? kind of.   is it good? YES. how are there not more arepas places in the US."}
{"text":"Wow.wow.wow. Typical Vegas hangover cure, for SUREEEEEEE. Why go to a buffet to pay more and get l as quality food in a variety of mediocre presentations. Here they have taken something that could be simple as arepas and super charged it with different flavor that create a whole new twist on Venezuelen cuisine. I'm in love with this place, and can't wait share it with other friends on my next Vegas trip.   We had reina pepiada and wood fire beef arepas. To die for, and you can not go wrong with the chicken thighs plate! So much chicken with your plate PLUS delicious and homemade rice and beans.  Your hungry and in Vegas?! GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Viva Las Arepas. My boyfriend introduced me to this place about a year ago and I am so glad he did. The cheese arepas have the most glorious mixture of mozzarella and what I believe may be cotija cheese. The empanadas and tequeños are also delicious. They also offer two delicious sauces one mild green chile sauce and a creamy variety with cilantro and garlic. My boyfriend always orders the passion fruit juice.  My office is just down the street so now everyone at my job is also hooked. I love this place!  The only negatives is that soft drinks are served in cans. A soda fountain would be much more convenient. I also wish there was another location closer to my house.   Other than that, this place owns my heart. And stomach."}
{"text":"Even in San Francisco, you simply cannot find an authentic Venezuelan restaurant !!  The food  is not only good, it is delicious.  Forget American, Chinese, Mexican food, this is truly a change for the better.....you will not be dasapointed."}
{"text":"My coworker told me if we were going to be in Vegas, this spot is a must. I had the #7. Arepa Reina Pepiada and the #1. Arepa Wood Fire Beef. I put the sauce that was provided with it and not oh boy, I've never had anything like this! The location was a little bit sketchy as there was a bum going through the trash looking for food, but hey, it's Vegas! Love the food and will go there again when I'm back there."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this spot for awhile. Never had an arepa prior to tonight. I'm hooked! Besides being fantastically good tasting the service was outstanding. Very friendly, at least three different staff members said hello from the kitchen behind the counter. Gentleman at the register explained what everything was without being too wordy or over the top. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was so good. The place is a casual (but clean) fast food seating, but the food is absolutely delicious! I should start by saying that I have never had an arepas, so I had no idea what to expect.   I ordered the arepa wood fire beef, chicken empanadas, fried plantains, and a mango drink. Y'all it was DELICIOUS! I loved the arepa, although I did remove the lettuce. Such good food for a low price. I highly recommend stopping their for lunch or dinner.   Folks were extremely nice and worked extremely quickly to make the food. You can easily see into the kitchen. Viva Las Arepas works magic!"}
{"text":"As a first timer at Viva Las Arepas in Las Vegas I was pretty impressed!  Cute little ground corn pocket breads with delicious meat fillings!   I had the chicken, avocado and coriander one. So delicious and different with peas throughout. Not as heavy as the pork butt Arepas but great none the less.   The pork butt Arepas was delicious & full of flavour. Definitely a favourite but would only have one as they are quite filling!  Great service & didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Great food! Located between downtown and the stratosphere. It was our first time going and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The prices are decent but can easily go up with the upgrades (adding avocado, cheese or egg) especially if you get all three. We had the mango water and it did not disappoint, each sip tasted like you were biting into a mango. Also, don't forget to try the fried plantains, a great choice to accompany your arepa or dessert. The only thing I didn't care for was the touch screen payment which gives you in big options to add a tip, especially since we were dining out. The girl was informative and nice so we gave her a tip but it's kinda like tipping at a fast food place. If they came and took your order at your table I would feel more comfortable tipping.   Overall, great choice!!"}
{"text":"This place really does live up to the hype! The arepas are amazing! My favorite is the Wood Fire Chicken, shredded chicken with lettuce. I add on cheese and avocado. Then they have 'liquid delicious' in the form of two sauces they give you to add yourself. PLEASE do this! Add these sauces and it is DELICIOUS!!!!!! My second favorite is the Roasted Pork Butt it has tomato slices, and again...... you must add the sauces they give you... you MUST!!!! I have also tried the Garlic Shrimp..... it was good. The Wood Fire Beef was my least favorite so far.... it was very dry... even after adding the fabulous sauces."}
{"text":"I have been to the Las Vegas Boulevard location a few times, and have had the arepas there. This is my first visit to this location on Rainbow Blvd., but it won't be my last! I love the Arepas! Absolutely delicious! My husband loves the wood grilled chicken dinner. They serve two pieces, half of a chicken, or a whole chicken. All served with side dishes .... We both love the black beans!  My new favorite might  be the black bean and cheese empanada. Oh my gosh.... so good!!!  The only downside is the styrofoam containers.... even when dining in. The quality of the food justifies real dinner plates, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing. Try the Cachapas for something different."}
{"text":"You have not fully lived until you have tried Venezuelan arepas! This place, in particular, not only makes the most delicious arepas in Vegas but is also clean as well. Hands down, a must visit for any local or tourist!"}
{"text":"Pretty weird to get to I was going north on LV BLVD and turned left in Wyoming went around behind the restaurant then into the parking lot. I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, so one day before getting custard from Luv It i made we made a pit stop here.   I LOVE carne asada....I try it everywhere I go and I make it myself! So naturally what do I order???  A carne asada arepa! Now I wasn't too familiar with what arepa exactly is going into the restaurant, I had seen the pictures, meat stuffed in a bun looking thing! Well I was half right it's meat stuffed into a circle of masa. Think the filling of a tamale! I do not like masa! I only eat the meat from a tamal and pretty much did the same here....it's not their fault I dislike masa so that's not why they only got 3 stars. The carne asada had a funny flavor to it. I can't put my finger on it but it was, well funny. I was given 3 sauces and was never explained what the heck they were. The creamy white-ish one was delish so I covered my funny tasting meat with it and went on my way.   I took one star for the odd location and one star for the funny meat. I may go back to hit up the chicken."}
{"text":"So I have never had Venezuelan food but I am so glad I tried this place. First I think you have to have an arepa because that's what they're famous for.  Luckily I went with two friends so we were able to try a bunch of different things. We had the shredded beef arepa which is amazing.  We then shared the cheese empanada and the chicken empanada.  The cheese was my absolute favorite. Then we got the mixed Grill which had chicken beef sausage and pork ribs you get two sides with that. Let me tell you the sausage was the best I've ever had.   The proprietors are so friendly and the restaurant is really clean and I would definitely go there again and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"After reading a ton of reviews, studying the menu and looking through pictures, I went in knowing exactly what I wanted. And I was more than pleased with the result!  I ordered a cachapa (a corn pancake folded in half and filled with cheese) and added their Pulled pork butt with a side of yuca fries. All of this was just under $12 and provided enough food that I took half home (even after sharing the yuca with my hungry nine month old son).   I've never had a cachapa before and have nothing to compare it to. Nor have I had Venezuelan pork. But both were everything I was hoping they'd be and more! The corn Pancake was super moist and the flavor of corn came right through. The layer of cheese was very thick, very melted and very gooey - perfect! And the Pulled pork? Shredded, tender and covered in a sweet sauce (it reminded me of a BBQ sauce).   The yuca fries were thick and unevenly cut -crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They were mildly salted and definitely needed their cilantro sauce. But they were quite nice!   I can't wait to go back and bring my husband and anyone else that visits us! I have to say that I'm so in love with what I ordered the first time that it will be hard to try something new...but maybe another meat or sweet plantains to share??"}
{"text":"First time and won't be our last. Went with my husband we ordered the #7 Chicken Arepa and the #12 Beef Arepa. And chicken Empanadas. We shared all, the chicken and beef had a hint of a smoky flavor. Loved the plantains and cilantro mayo on the beef Arepa. The arepa dough that the sandwhich is in was perfect texture and nice and warm. Had a nutty corn taste. The chicken arepa was also very good combination with avocado.  As for the Empanadas they were perfect temperature and flavor.  Wonderful customer service hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came to this place awhile back and didn't review it on the spot.  I really enjoyed there dishes.  it was full of flavor and the price is pretty decent. The Arepa was very good and I enjoyed the  Wood Fire Beef and Carne Asada.  I will definitely come back again, when I am in the mood for something else.  The only complaint I have about this place is the location, I got lost trying to find it and when I found it parking wasn't that great.. But that won't stop me from going again when I am in the area.  I also Like the staff they are very friendly and will ask any questions you have.  Especially if your unfamiliar with the food or need a good recommendation.  So don't be shy, they really want you to ask, so that way you can order something you enjoy. The establishment is very clean and open.  They have plenty of seats."}
{"text":"Fantastic food,  great prices! Try the carne asada arepa and the passion fruit drink. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The chicken arepas are a must try. They are full of flavors better than the carne asada which was dry. Empanadas was ok, would not order again. Need to try chicken next time."}
{"text":"This is my first Venezuelan food experience, and I think it's off to a great start! The food is very unique, and it's important to point out this restaurant is gluten free. I love the simplicity of ingredients focused on quality.   The meat is cooked with a traditional grill using wood which is a layer of flavor that is unmistakable! Arepas is a ground maize dough to make a variety of sandwiches. I recommend the wood fire beef with cheese, tomato, and avocado, reina pepiada, and garlic shrimp. There's also a pancake made of sweet corn and cheese called Cachapa.  Soo good!   The service has been excellent the last two times I've been there with friendliest chef taking orders and willing to explain everything!"}
{"text":"I originally tried Viva Las Arepas from a food truck at a Yelp event and loved it! I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this location which is much closer to my house. My boyfriend and I stopped by for a quick dinner on a Friday evening.   The arepas themselves are sort of like a pita pocket with delicious toppings inside. I liked that they had a couple different vegetarian options and he loved the Wood Fire Beef. This most recent time I tried the Arepa Vegeterian and added cheese. It was definitely stuffed to the brim with toppings which was great, but the best part to me was the black beans. They were super flavorful! I also could not get enough of the green sauce, so good!  I'm sure we will be back again for a quick meal or maybe even delivery. It's definitely more of a grab and go type place since the inside is a bit small."}
{"text":"I had an irrational fear of shredded meats. They usually end up tasting without flavor accompanied by dry textures. This is why I've avoided this place for so long, but I regret that I did just that. What started as a fear ended up being a warm embrace. This Venezuelan establishment is a jewel above standard Latin and South American cuisine.   Located a few blocks north from The Stratosphere at the end of The Strip, lies a little strip mall where a small fast food joint looks to make a big punch with their specialty: the arepa.  Handcrafted and stuffed with flavorful and steaming shredded carne asada, the arepa is a pocket full of inspiring and familiar tastes. Along with the arepas are two sauces to accompany your meal. A spicy salsa-like sauce and a creamy, yet tangy sauce. You have to have one of these sauces at every bite, or you'll be missing out on this beautiful combination.   I ate this with a huge side of subtly tangy Basmati rice. A great combo if you ask me.   The service friendly, quick, and accommodating, you'll feel like you're king of the world during that five minute meal with this Venezuelan staple."}
{"text":"I've never had arepas before.  So I have nothing to compare. Arepas are okay in my book.  This place is apparently in the scary part of town.  As I mentioned I wanted to come here to 3 other people who frequent or lives near Las Vegas, they said, \"ooohh it's on THAT part of town.\"  We ordered 4-5 different items and a couple of desserts.   Everyone liked the corn cachapa.  I was okay with it.  I did try it when it wasn't hot anymore.  And it's one of those food items you want while hot and the cheese is empty.    I had the asada arepa.  It was good. I think the texture of the arepa is very thick and maybe fried.  So after half an arepa, I was pretty much done.   I didn't think one would fill me up, but it did. After finishing my meal,  It definitely felt \"heavy\" from the fried, oily part.   Reina arepa was good too.  Tasty sauce.  Guava and cheese pastry and the coconut one was not good.  The pastry was not flakey like I'm used to.  I generally love Cuban's guava and cheese pastries and thought this would be a bit similar.    Location: apparently the scary side of town.   Service: okay, nothing special.  None of us had ever had arepas but we felt rushed from the man taking our order as if he expected us to know exactly what we want.   We sat outside and they brought out our food to us.    I would like to give arepas another try.  Maybe here, maybe somewhere else."}
{"text":"Arepas!   Located at the very end of Las Vegas Blvd. Parking lot is super small and tight.  Asada Arepa - $5.50 - Meat is cooked so soft and tender and really well seasoned. I could taste the grill in the meat. The lettuce and tomato keep the flavor from getting boring.   Pollo Arepa - $5 - Again meat was cooked perfectly and the grill flavor really comes through. The chicken was not dry at all. If this came with lettuce and tomato, it would have been perfect.  Carne Empanada - $3 - Meat was really good but it was more dough and no stuffing.  Green and white sauce are so good. I wish they gave more for to go orders then two small ass cups.   It really should be a 3-3.5 overall but the meat was cooked so well. I am just not a fan of the arepa bun. Arepa, torta, papusa, I still rather have my meat in a taco or burrito."}
{"text":"I love love this place!!! I paid $5 delivery, because I couldn't not have this delicious food! I had the pork arepa, plantains, and yuca fries. I enjoy all of them a ton! Plus those sauces were delectable."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Venezuelan food! Was blown away to find this little gem on the strip! My tummy and my heart are both so happy right now! George was so sweet! Genuine delicious Venezuelan food made by real Venezuelans!! Yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I just happened in Viva Las Arepas. I was out driving, and decided to stop in for lunch. I was extremely pleased I did, and even made a vlog review while I was in. This place has exceptional Venezuelan food!   Check out my full review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5pVFms_8P4"}
{"text":"This place is as authentic as  you can get for Venezuelan food! Never disappoints. Prices have gone up, but when we are in Vegas...we always pay Felix a visit!"}
{"text":"This is Venezuelan soul food in my opinion because it's definitely made with love. Yum! Great ambiance and really up beat attitudes on the service end as well. I've been hearing people rave about this place so I finally gave it a shot. The yucca root fries are bomb with the creamy green sauce. Their shredded beef in definitely a winner and I love the combinations of black beans and meat, I'm a huge bean addict. . . I crave protein like no other and this place can give you a great protein filled gluten free meal or a vegetarian|vegan one at that! (something ridiculously hard to find in fast casual dining for whatever reason) No. . . I don't want to go out to eat and have a salad. Proteins + Good carbs here! I don't have celiacs but this place is definitely celiacs friendly! Craving a hearty meal. . .these arepas really do the trick! It can be a naughty or a nice meal and I love the option! Must try!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always frequent the one on the strip. But was in the area and REALLY wanted some arepas!!! Same high quality food and consistency! This place is great if you're looking for AWESOME food! Great place to meet up for lunch or dinner! The intoxicating and ohhh so delicious smell of wood fired meats hits you the second you walk in! And the customer service is beyond exceptional! Keep up the great work guys!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, but I thought it was way too expensive for what you get. Each item is pretty small and they say one person should order two, and they were not wrong.  I'm an athlete with a big appetite, so I ordered three for about $21. Way too expensive in my humble opinion but it was good food."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago with my out-of-town peeps and I'm really glad I did!   Upon arriving, I noticed that the place was packed and the parking lot was completely FULL. The service is pretty fast and the line at one point was out the door.   I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Arepa (you can have it either hot or cold. I ordered it hot.) & the Pork Butt Arepa. Both were PACKED with flavor. They can be a little deceiving though. They're no bigger than a regular cheeseburger, but I found myself getting full fast! I ended up only eating half of both, then just picked at the insides. (the garlic shrimp was just too good to leave behind)  Even though the place is located in downtown LV, it was pretty clean and the bathrooms were well maintained.   I also noticed how friendly the associates were. Even though there was a pretty sizable line behind me while I was ordering, I never felt rushed and they were more than happy to make me something that was not on the menu. My little wanted rice with vegetables (thats on the menu) with a fried egg (not on the menu).   The restaurant itself is a waaaays away from my place, but I don't think that would stop us from popping in from time to time."}
{"text":"Super BOMB food! People were very friendly and service was really quick! My husband is Venezuelan and makes this type of food and we were honestly both in HEAVEN! So delicious we will be eating here again for sure before we leave Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Damn this is one of my best finds in Vegas. Never had a bad Arepa here and I've tried many of them. Arepas are little sandwiches from Venezuela. The bread is made from corn meal (glutton free :) and Viva Arepas does a great job with them. I've had the #4, #12, #11, and #13. All were GREAT. #11 has scrambled eggs and hits the spot for breakfast. If you're really hungry or want to try a couple flavors, get 2, but even 1 is pretty darn filling for a meal."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable food with an a la carte style menu.  The arepas are amazing and the empanadas are worth a try.  We always stop by for a quick bite whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok I am born and raised in Maracaibo Venezuela... I know a good Venezuelan meal and this is excellent. I was very well pleased with the food, the service,,, everything. by far the best surprise I had in Vegas... can't miss it if you are looking for latin food you gotta try this. I (my family) had an Arepa with shredded beef, Cachapa and tequenos, Best in the west,"}
{"text":"I love food stands and this is a must try place.  The service was great.  It was freezing and windy the night I went, and the nice vendor told his clients to wait in their cars and that he would bring it to us.  You don't have to go to a fancy restaurant to get 5 star service. The food was interesting.  It was my first time having arepas and I got the hot Lengua Arepas (tongue)  and a cold Reina Pepiada (chicken avocado--**their most raved about arepas**).  Get the green chile sauces..it enhances the taste. They both come in the grainy textured corn bun (similar to an english muffin).  The Lengua Arepas is a little messy because of the oiliness of the sauce. I actually liked the Reina Pepiada more because of the fusion of the cilantro, mayo, and avocado marinating the shredded chicken.  You have to at least try it out once."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. I've had the pork butt and the chicken and both were great. The service is nice too. Only thing is it's a little bit pricey for small-ish sandwiches but compared to other places in Vegas it's pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Whenever my family wants to go to las vegas for a weekend getaway we ALWAYS eat at Viva Las Arepas as our last stop. My favorite is the Arepa con Desmechada (pulled pork). ALWAYS go with the wood fired arepas. They are the best stuff around and I can't get them anywhere else in united states! Compared to Colombian prices this is pricey, but, hey can't be choosy when it comes to finding the best exotic food!"}
{"text":"Super yummy and gluten free!  In Vegas with a friend and looking for places to eat that accommodate my dairy and gluten free needs.  Had the fried plantains (no breading) try them with the cilantro sauce.  Yum.  For arepas we had shredded beef #3, shredded chicken #2, and reina pepiada #7.   #7 was cold (it's suppose to be) and really great.  The other two were fantastic too.  It's a total value, really flavorful and very filling!  Great little place casual all around."}
{"text":"Hmm. Do I love arepas? Thanks to this tiny food stand under the shadow of the Stratosphere Tower, I'd have to say a resounding YES!  I had never heard of this culinary item until I found out about this place. Some compare arepas (Venezuelan) to pupusas (Salvadoran). It's a fair comparison, but they're not quite the same. I say the only real way to find out is to try them for yourself. You won't regret it.  I've been here twice now. First, I tried the tripe, which was killer. The next time, I tried the tongue, which was similarly murderous. Now, if you don't like tripe or tongue, this place isn't going to change your mind. Don't worry, they also serve your basic fillings, like beef and chicken.  Currently, the only problem I have with this place is the slow service. Basically, it's like the chef has to do all the work because the hired help is incredibly incompetent. Fortunately, the last time I was there, I talked to the chef and he said he hired a new employee and she was starting the next day. Honestly, it hasn't been a huge inconvenience so far, but if there ever was a long line here, watch out. I'm hoping the new employee works out.  In any event, I'm a fan of this place. Arepas, I love thee."}
{"text":"It's like a Venezuelan In-n-Out, only it's 100x better! My go-to arepa is the roasted pork butt. So juicy! Add some of the hot sauce and green sauce with every bite. Balance this meal with a tangy passion fruit drink. Empanadas are also freshly made and delicious."}
{"text":"From the Foodie Snob:  This place is totally Legit! Great fast friendly service and a clean restaurant. Oh, BTW did I mention the arepas? Fresh ingredients and very tasty. I only wish this place was located in Henderson due to the headache of driving in traffic near downtown."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back! I come up with reasons to go down there just so I can hit up this place. I didn't even know what an arepa was but my friend told me about this place and said I had to try it.  As soon as I walked in I could smell the woods smoking all those delicious meats, I was like a kid in a candy store! I wanted to try everything but I definitely didn't know where to start. Thank goodness for all the tasty looking pictures on the walls. The staff was very helpful and super patient with me. I've never had Venezuela food before, I can't wait to try more!   For my first visit, I figured it would be best to pick a column and work my way down so I went for the #1 Wood Fired Beef, my niece got the #8 Garlic Shrimp, and my Sister got a #12 Cachapa. They were all amazing! The cilantro mayo and the hot sauce mixed are killer. I also tried the soursop drink and it was so good, it tasted like strawberry, watermelon, kiwi, and passion fruit had a delicious baby juice in my cup.  I can't wait to go back and add more to this amazing experience. For now, I'm heading next door to the Art of Flavors for dessert."}
{"text":"Some of the best food ive ever had in my life !!!if u dont use yelp your a fool...this place is special ... thank God for yelp or i would have never probly found this gem.. this is one of them spots that if ur a local  and dont know about ... then ur missing out on vegas !"}
{"text":"Bebida Parchita was a delicious treat to a hot summer day. My sister & I had to take our lunch to go since there is limited seating in shade.  We prefer to eat our hot food in cool places; I would love to enjoy the entire I LOVE AREPAS experience by eating outside after sundown. We each ordered the number 7 and empanada con frijoles negros y queso.  The number 7 was my first choice as I've seen my fellow yelpers say only good things.  I very much enjoyed this #7 and would order it again! The green salsa was spicy but the burning sensation was drowned out by my bebida parchita!   Ultimately I miss tapatio. He would have enjoyed being eaten with my meal."}
{"text":"Incredible chicken and salad.  Very casual (dive) and very inexpensive.   This place is great!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Arepas! Has a large variety of Venezuelan food. Everything tasted so good! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come here when you're in Vegas! We came around 1030 for brunch and left 100% satisfied. Don't expect amazing service, but expect hot, fresh, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great value vs food quality served. Tried the pig butt and pulled meat pie, first was so-so, but the pie was amazing.  Would totally like to try out more things if ever possible.  Also, superb service."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new since I'm doing rotations in this area. So 4 words: melts-in-your-mouth!!! Iiterally had this yesterday #1 is good but today I had the Arepas #7 but mixed with #12 is so bomb !!! So the guy recommends Arepas #1, 7, and 12. Plus the addition of  plantain sides was so yummy. Try it"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and this will be my last one. I can tell as a Venezuelan that the quality of the food has dropped by a lot. The Carne Mechada taste sour and does not even look like Carne mechada. The empanadas somehow shrank, to make a long story short, this is not authentic Venezuelan food at all. Never coming back again. For the people that travels and want to go to a good Venezuelan restauran, check Mil Jugos in Santa Ana, California. This place in vegas not worth the trip. Bu the way, the good reviews are probably from people that haven't even tried real Venezuelan food."}
{"text":"Love the roasted pork aprea. The food is reasonable prices as well and is very close to the strip. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good arepas! I recommend trying the reina pepiada (chicken breast bites mixed with cilantro and avocado in a ground maize dough flat bread - the filling texture is similar to a creamy chicken salad). The interior is clean, the service is fast, and the price is great!"}
{"text":"They make their bread out of corn and bake it fresh. The quality of their beef and chicken is great! Authentic food and great service.  It's great, however i'd say they are a bit pricey. Are they trying to be a  hole in the wall type spot or a clean casual, fast dining type eatery. That confuses the customer bit, because you end up paying a bit more than you'd anticipate at a spot like this."}
{"text":"My pork was salty and I love salt so was a bit of a bummer for me. The experience is just ok, downtown vibe but nothing to write home about food wise. I wanted to try the chicken and it was OK as were the Arepas. The beef was horrible and cheapest quality. The rice and beans were the high light and I'm not much into paper plates and cutlery so probably won't return. The price is high when you consider food is not top of the line."}
{"text":"These guys are a perfect late-night padding stop.  I have never had arepas before, so I can't compare to anyone else's, but these are great.  We've only tried a few of the fillings so far, and they are the ultimate late-night comfort food.  If anything, they're a smidge salty, but they will definitely cure your ills before calling it a night."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Authentic. Delicious. Friendly. Who needs to pay a fortune for Vegas food when just down a ways you have such delicious fare? Honestly, I wish I could shove even more food in my belly at this place but i stuffed myself! Try the sweet plantains. Heck. Try everything.... And unlike the rest of Vegas, you'll actually have money left in your pocket when you leave! You are welcome. :)"}
{"text":"*Yelp 100 challenge complete!  As much as Vegas is founded on facades and paradoxes, I found it pleasantly appropriate that perhaps the best food I had in Vegas came from this hole-in-the-wall place in the corner of a sketchy looking strip mall far from the Strip as opposed even to the meal I had a L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!  One of the benefits of Vegas is that can you drive a few miles and start your morning with some Hawaiian Poke, have some French for lunch, and finish with Venezuelan food. I'm glad we came here, saving this local gem for last.  The Arepas here were fantastic all served piping hot. To rank them in order:  1) Reina Peplada: Chicken Breast, Mayo, Avocado, Cilantro 2) Wood Fire Beef - think carne asada 3) Garlic Shrimp - big pieces of shrimp just not the best shrimp in quality  The corn meal bun is crisp and houses some incredibly tasty meat. They give you sauces but thats not necessary with all that is going on in the arepas.   Also the Yucca Root fries were good fat fries but I will go with their normal french fries next time.  And I know it is just rotisserie chicken but something about that actual hickory wood fire grill really brought out the flavor in the Wood Fire Chicken plate ($14.99). It was perfectly moist and tender and the skin was the right amount of char and crisp.  I thought the Passion Fruit juice edged the Mango juice and it is refreshing and the right complement to the arepas.  My advice to Vegas-goers is to take a slight detour to Viva Las Arepas for some very delicious comfort food. Then make it extra special by going right next door to Art of Flavors (one of the best gelatos I've had in the city).   Viva Las Arepas!  Tip: Ask to sample juice flavors"}
{"text":"This casual restaurant serves Venezuelan fare including its signature arepas. Orders are taken at the counter and the food is delivered to the table along with 3 bottles containing different sauces. We each ordered the reina pepiada arepa - an interesting take on chicken salad made with shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. It is served between slices of flatbread that are made with precooked corn flour. We enjoyed the arepas, but I am not in a rush for a repeat.   A rating of 2.5 would seem to be most appropriate."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  The people working there are super nice and helpful.  I love the fact that we can find unique food like this.  We were in Vegas for a business trip and did not feel like going to a fancy dinner steak house, the location of this place is awesome as well, not in the middle of the chaos so the parking is easy.  the person who rang us up was VERY helpful in helping us choose what to eat.  I hope this place sticks!!!! its such a better alternative to that yucky taco spot just down the way.  A+ guys!"}
{"text":"Had a number 7, it was delicious. Would give five stars for food alone but the service was curt and borderline rude from the order taker. Don't let that deter you however as the food is quite good, at least from my admittedly limited experience."}
{"text":"It's a shame, but after each visit, I've become less and less impressed. My first visit was phenomenal and my second visit was still pretty great (as evidenced in my previous review). The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.  Since I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the \"Vegetarian\" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!  Also, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored. No one ever checks on us (it's usually me and Ruben), while they seem more than happy to visit and chat with several other customers. It has made us feel unwelcome. I'm really sad to say this, but I will be getting my arepas elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"can't put into words how i fell about this place.    Just get your ass here now!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a crow pleaser. Fresh fruit juices. Best yam muleta arepas and super affordable."}
{"text":"Awesome gem of Las Vegas!   Yummmm. The Reina Pepiada Arepa is a must but it's alll good!   I love the authenticity of the food. Very very flavorful.   The guava and cheese Pastelito is like a delicious toaster-strudel dessert and all the juices are really tasty!  Minimal service but they are all very nice.    Not sure why it took me so long to come back to Las Arepas (like a yr) but it will definitely be a more frequent spot for me!"}
{"text":"I loved all the Arepas!! Their house sauce was excellent to go with any arepa, don't forget to grab one. The chicken salad arepa was their signature and I was hesitant to try it, but I'm so glad I did. There were so many items I didn't get to try, but it's just another great excuse to come back. Try the passion fruit juice too (thank you to all who recommend that) it was totally worth it.  I also really appreciate the cleanliness of the entire restaurant from the tables and chairs to the bathrooms- it makes a BIG difference! See you soon, viva las Arepas!"}
{"text":"Love the cedar smoke they use for the meat. I had the carne asada arepa which was good, but I kinda wish it was jucier. The staff was very inviting and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place! I've never heard of arepas before & it makes me feel sad b/c I was missing out on such good food!!  I've only been here twice but got the same thing both times. Reina pepiada & wood fire beef. Both of them are so so good!  The filling is so flavorful & the bun (sorry i know it's not called that, its like made out of corn or something right?) is delicious! When you bite into it the bun part is a bit crispy & then the filling is juicy, meaty, & saucy!  Also, they gave you some sauces on the side to eat with it. I'm not exactly sure what kind of sauce it is but it seriously compliments the Arepa!  The green sauce is uh-mazing!   I wish it were a bit cheaper, but you can't beat the flavor & taste.   10/10 would recommend!! :-)"}
{"text":"Came to this little gem on a late Saturday morning and I've been wanting to come back ever since! This is Venezuelan food done right, as you can taste the wood fire smoke and freshness in each pastry. This shop is located just a stone's throw away from The Stratosphere Hotel and definitely worth the drive from the strip. Parking lot in front and on the side of the building was easy enough. For 5 food items off the menu for 2 people (look below), our total came to about $24. -cup of black coffee (wasn't the best, wasn't absolutely horrible) -shredded chicken arepa (this was hands down THE BEST item, IMO on the menu) -beef arepa (the little beef chunks in this was pretty good, but the shredded chicken had much more flavor and punch) -beef and rice pastelito (this was also AMAZING and just perfection! ) -chicken empanada (I'm not sure how they get their pastry dough so perfect, but I want 10 more of these) -guava and cheese pastelito (Wasn't a huge fan of this one, probably won't order it again next time).   This place has something to please any one. They even  have gluten-sensitive items if you're into that stuff. Check it out if you're somewhere nearby, you won't regret it! I can't wait to come back to this delightful gem."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. The arepa pabellon is amazing. I always get a side of platanos maduros. Moving here from Cleveland, it's awesome to finally have a real arepa. Either this location or the one on Rainbow, they are both great."}
{"text":"Viva las arepas! Great food great juices! Go and see ramon hes the best! I recommend the reina pepiada with cheese ."}
{"text":"My fav arepa is the perrico! Tried the online order option & skipped the line. Didn't have to wait as they were ready right on time. Always such great customer service!"}
{"text":"The arepas and the carne asada fries were so good! If you go during a busy time, there won't be enough parking."}
{"text":"I could of sworn I wrote a review for Viva Las Arepas a few years back, my apologies. I began coming and enjoying these delish arepas when this establishment was the humble little shack across the parking lot now replaced by an up and coming gourmet sandwich joint. My first time here the owners kid was out behind the shack and some drunk women was walking up and the down the street cursing and confronting customers so I called the cops and my mom went to go talk to the little girl and her mom so she wouldn't be scare. The chef was busy so as a thank you he gave us a few free orders of the cheese sticks. After that I became a regular.   The pork arepa is filled with really tender pulled pork but I always order without the tomato slice. The shrimp arepa is really yummy too, sautéed shrimp in a mild spicy condiment sauce served hot. The bean an cheese arepa, can nothing go wrong with those!!! Finally but not least, the Reina Pepiada is my absolute favorite!!! It is made with shredded chicken, mayo, avocado, peas and cilantro.   The arepas are served in rustic baskets which I hate because when people spill their arepa juice, how do they clean them? I eat mine over the paper they come in. The new locating is sooo nice and big too. Their menu is extensive, it contains other Venezuelan goodies like cachepas which are these sweet little pancakes. The parking lot is still limited but I never have a problem and I'd walk a few blocks to try these guys out, trust me!!!"}
{"text":"I am sorry, but there is nothing wrong with this place. The workers are friendly. The food is great. It has outdoor seating (which may bother some, but not me personally). I got the food relatively quickly and I continue to come back because these people know how to make DELICIOUS FOOD. Honestly, you can order anything on the menu and you will be golden."}
{"text":"People are nice and the food taste great ( at least what I ordered). The pork butt and the Venezuelan soda was amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The green salsa/sauce is so good that they give you. We order from here all the time. Order the line gets crazy some times."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, and watching this place featured on a television show, I've been itching to try this place out.  I finally went here for lunch and wasn't disappointed.  I shared 3 arepas with a friend- carne asada, chicken asada, and the cold chicken salad.  There are menus in English and Spanish, and in English the asadas are called wood fire.  I ordered these three because they were identified on the menu with a small icon, which meant they were chef recommended.  There was a short wait because this is not fast food where meals are prepared ahead of time and placed under a heat lamp.  They appear to be made to order and you can taste the difference.  The cost of the arepas were $5.00 to $5.50 and cheese ($.50) and avocado ($.99) are extra.  I liked the beef the best.   What struck me was the size of the arepas.  They were larger than I thought and one was enough to satisfy me for lunch.  I had 1.5 arepas and was stuffed.  The breading used is gluten free and is not chewy.  I would describe it more similar to the crunchy outside of a buttermilk biscuit.    The cons were a very small parking lot and it isn't in a very safe area (right across from the Olympic Garden).  But overall I recommend this place and I'll be back to try the empenadas, which I was told were home made."}
{"text":"VIVA LAS AREPAS!!   Love this place. Great interior, it perfectly matches the vibe of the restaurant. Great staff, they are personable and greet you with a smile(I'm convinced the newer cashier guy doesn't like me though but it could never stop me from coming).  On to the food. I have tried nearly every single menu item, sides and sweets included, and not one single item has disappointed me. I've gotten to the point of trying things just to see if I can be disappointed with an offering and nope, not close. I have liked every item and this is impressive.  The location is situated on the edge of downtown and is perfect for a grab and go meal or a casual sit down experience. I only wish the best for Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and different from Mexican restaurants. It's Venezuelan. The Arepas are corn based but very good. The wrap is like a flatbread but made of maize. It's very good. I swear it tastes like potato inside which is much nicer than corn according to me.  We ordered the pork and beef and they were both delicious. The pork had avocado and the other one, the beef, had a slice of tomato. The flavoring reminds me of Brazilian meats which has a nice grilled citrusy flavor. It's got a tang to it too and you don't really need to add any sauce to it.  But it does come with 2 squirter Bottles of sauce. One spicy,  not really, it's as spicy as El Patio sauce. The mild is mild."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while because of the stars on yelp. Stopped  in for a quick lunch and had the pork butt Arepa, WOW!! Soo good, lots of flavor, I added cheese and avocado a must.  The salsa was very good and tasty with just the right heat.  Also had beef empanada, that was ok. Will go back to try other Arepas."}
{"text":"Arepas... wish we met earlier in life!  Smokey, salty, meaty, spicy.... so good.  Yelp led me here and I'm now going to seek out Arepas in LA when I get back!  Chicharron, mix grill, pabellon, cheese empanada, sugar cane and lime drink.  Deliciousness... can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The arepas are delicious. I had the BBQ chicken which was a pulled chicken style sandwich. There was a lot of meat on the sandwich and it was tasty. I also got the cheese arepa which was just cheese on the arepa. I really liked this, simple yet delicious. The sauces that came with it were nice accompaniment. The darker yellow sauce was spicy so be careful if you don't like spicy foods. The lighter green sauce was a creamy cilantro style and was nice. Definitely will try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great food.  And is true....authentic venezuelan cuisine. We got the Cachapa, Reina Pepiada, Arepa de Pabellon and Carne Asada.  If you like latin food and want to eat out of the Strip crowd...visit Viva Las Arepas!!!"}
{"text":"I Love Arepas is a great Venezuelan food stand that is excellent in every way. Delicious arepas, friendly service, fast and inexpensive. My favorite thing to eat there is the #7 Reina Pepiada, which is a shredded chicken breast salad, made with avocado, mayo, cilantro and peas.It is definitely the star on the menu, but the carne mechada, pork butt (pernil) and the bean and cheese arepas are also great. I usually ask for cotija cheese on the arepas, it's yummy.  Make sure to try the juices too.They are refreshing, especially on a hot Vegas day. I like the Tamarindo and the Agua de Panela (sugar cane and lime). The staff is great, they really take pride in their service. This is hands down my favorite fast food in Vegas and everyone should check it out!"}
{"text":"Ok. I took my mom here about a month ago.  I wanted to give it a try and was very excited!  It was very easy to find but there wasn't much parking in the front.  Therefore, I had to park on the back of the building, which I didn't like because this place is not on the greatest side of the Vegas strip.  This place has indoor and outdoor seating.  We decided to sit inside because it was way too hot!  We went on a Sat afternoon, 1p to be exact. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to take my time and look at the menu.  I was greeted by a gentleman but felt rushed since he was just standing at the register staring at us.  I asked, please give us a few minutes and he just stood there - staring!!!  We ordered the Shredded Beef Arepa, which was $6. I asked for him to tell me how big they were and based on his description and pricing, I'd figure that one would be enough.  We ordered two, one for each and platanos.  We sat down and that's when I noticed that there was only two people there. Found it quite odd, especially on a weekend.  Then the table we chose to sit at was wet and sticky, very nasty!  I had to get some napkins to dry it all off!! The window was nasty full of finger prints.  Then I noticed a bed of dead flies on the window sill.  This really really grossed me out. Then they called my name, my order was done!  I got my food on some baskets which were on a tray. Two squeeze bottles of hot sauce, one green and one red.  The arepas were the size of my palm. Very small!!  They were wrapped up in paper which i had to peel off and very sloppy.  The meat was very well seasoned  and the Arepa was very thin.  I was very very very disappointed!!! I just could not believe how small and over priced they were. This place was filthy filthy filthy!!!  Now I know why this place was completely empty!!  What a shame!!!  This was my first and last time I'll ever go to this place!!  If you want to have a really good Arepa - go to -  OIGA MIRE VEA!! Look them up!! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years! I recommend the Number 3 Arepa with Yuca fries. Delicious."}
{"text":"Maybe I had high expectations when I walked in here but the fried yuca was not properly cooked, the beef in the Arepa tasted boiled and lacking in flavor. I did enjoy the cheese empanada and the chicken was pretty tasty. I don't plan on coming back anytime soon, I found nothing about this meal to be memorable."}
{"text":"A great alternative to the fancy (expensive) food in the las vegas strip. Had the veggie arepa and the guava pastel with a side of tostones - flavorful, fresh food and filling!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing arepas! Great customer service and great food! My favorite is the Cachapa! Been here 3 times and will continue to visit. Thank you and Viva la AREPAS!"}
{"text":"So good, every time I go it is the same and just as good as the last time. The Arepas are super good and so is the fried yuca. The service is top notch and super friendly no matter what time of night you go. Great place!"}
{"text":"Random food choice for lunch before we left Vegas. I saw this on yelp and the pictures had me like nom nom nom. Since arepas is pretty foreign to me, time to check this place out.  Parking was easy since they have a parking lot, even though it's on Las Vegas Blvd. It's a counter order establishment and the person who took our order was super nice and awesome. (If he had told me he owns that place, I wouldn't be surprised.) He greeted us when we walked in and after finding out it was our first time there, he made bunch of suggestions for us to try.  We got #1(wood fire steak), 7(chicken salad thing), 4(pork butt), 12(shredded beef, beans and plantain), and black bean & cheese empanada as he suggested. He did a great job on the suggestions because he made sure our food didn't have repeating ingredients. They were all great and tasty individually, but sadly, when we had all 4 in one setting, the chicken came in short on flavors. My favorite was the pork butt and slave girls' was shreed beef. Everything was well seasoned especially consumed with their house made spicy sauce.  They also serve entries other than arepas and based on the arepas we got, I can only imagine how amazing they will taste. Until next time, I will be drooling while dreaming."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE TO EAT ON LAS VEGAS BLVD!!! Their authentic Venenzuelan food is well prepared and incredibly savory...and their salsas...OMG be sure to get the creamy green salsa, but I mix them both. I have turned on countless friends to this gem and all are grateful for the tip. I have been coming here for years, every time  I am in Vegas. I watched them start at a food cart, as we stumbled upon them on drunk night.lol. From then forward I am required to bring home at least 2 dozen empanadas for family to enjoy. Was overjoyed the day I came to Vegas and saw they finally had their own building and were thriving because WOW IS THEIR FOOD DELICIOUS! Their prices are reasonable and their staff is not just friendly and helpful but they will accommodate you beyond expectations.   Easy to access when traveling between the strip and Freemont St \"the old strip\" (its not far from Stratosphere). They have both indoor and outdoor seating available.  I recommend the beef empanadas, the chicken empanadas a close second, and the favorite Arepas are the carne asada and the roasted pork. Be careful though the aArepas are large, 1-2 per person is good."}
{"text":"This is the best arepas place that I have been in Las Vegas, they have a great menú, and their prices are affordable which makes all the experience better, love it"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Vegas. Very affordable, too. I love the empanadas and the rice is to die for. I always order the fried plantains. I come here once a week now."}
{"text":"Superrrrr bombbbbb. The arepas itself were oily but hey, that's why it's so gooood. You could taste that the meats were cooked over wood. I tried the wood fired chicken arepa and the chicken was very soft and the sauce in it went well. I put a lot of that green hot sauce in there though. It gave it more flavor. The carne asada arepa was super juicy. The only downside is that the bread got soggy towards the end. The woodfired chicken plate was very juicy too. The French fries were really crispy just how I like it and the basmati rice was too buttery for my liking but that's what makes it tasty. Overall, I would definitely go again and again!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the number 12 is amazing. I don't only what else to say but it's not damn good!"}
{"text":"Hard not to repeat what most reviewers already wrote. I'll be honest I've never been a big fan of Arepas in general but maybe I've never been to place that knew how to make them. The vegetarian version is unbelievable glad the woman at the register recommended it to me. This is just another reason to venture beyond the strip when visit Las Vegas. I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Totally love this place. Excellent cachapas, arepas, and tequeños!!! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"YUM.  I tried arepas for the first time last night, and I'm sold.  These things are amazing.  I was swooning with every bite.  I had spoken with the owner earlier in the week and he told me that the arepa dough is made with milk, but that he would be happy to make me a special vegan one if I was willing to wait for it.  Well, Saturday night, drunk and hungry, I was more than willing to wait.  And I am so glad that I did! He made me a gorgeous arepa filled with black beans, and topped with freshly sliced avocado and tomato.  I have not stopped thinking about this food since I finished eating it, and I will definitely be going back soon.  The arepa dough was crispy from the grill on the outside (and btw, they cleaned the grill and made mine off to the side of all the other ones!) and almost fluffy on the inside.  The fillings were so fresh and tasty too! Every bite put a smile on my face.    As a regular at Dino's, I am so thrilled to have a late night, vegan friendly food option to help me soak up the booze! And I really appreciate how super friendly and accommodating the folks who run the place were.    My carnivorous friends went crazy over their non-vegan pork arepas too... and in fact everyone I saw get food there seemed pleased.  If you've never tried arepas you have been missing out!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place but didn't get to try it until recently. They used to serve food from a little small stand on the side of the road but they have now moved into a brick and mortar restaurant on the corner of Wyoming and Las Vegas Blvd.  The restaurant itself is nice and clean, but the location is easy to miss if you go there for the first time. By the time you see the restaurant, you probably will need to make a roundabout just to be able to get into the parking lot.  Anyway, I've only tried three things at this place: rib eye steak, pork butt arepas, and asada arepas. I know that it's strange that I go to an arapas place and ordered steak, but they had a special rib eye steak for $10.99 and I was craving for it (LOL). Even though the meat wasn't high quality, the fire grilling and seasoning brought out great flavor from the meat and their side dishes were delicious.   For the pork butt arepas, the meat was too salty for my taste. Also the corn shells/buns were too oily. The asada meat was alright also.   So what's my verdict? If you haven't tried arepas and want something different, I think you should come by and give it a try. For me, it wasn't bad but at the same time it wasn't that good for me to come back on a regular basis. I will probably stop by the next time I'm in the mood for steak during lunch or want to try something different."}
{"text":"Exactly like Venezuela. Delicious food. Great ambiance. Friendly staff. The spread are amazing. The fried plantains with crema delicious. Be sure to get juice! Great prices."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I decided to pick up a bunch of arepas for the road trip back to LA. My favorite was reina pepieda...it was moist, flavorful and really delicious. It is full of avocado, cilantro sauce and yummy chicken. I wish I had bought only this as the other arepas were lack luster.   The shredded beef one especially was dry and pretty chewy. Even after loading it up with the cilantro sauce, it was pretty blah. The chicken one was ok but the reina pepieda is the only one that warrants the 4 stars. Overall it's a pretty cheap and tasty alternative if you are looking for food in a hurry and if you order the right one."}
{"text":"Loved the arepas! Got 2 but I only needed one. I liked the diversity of the menu. Definitely will try other things on the menu including the empanadas. Loved the plantains!"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed Viva Las Arepas yet?! Best fix that.   Viva Las Arepas is worth a trip whether you're familiar with the Venezuelan wonder food or have never tried these meat-filled Joy Pockets. It's representative of the best the genre has to offer; the arepa itself is fluffy and moist, and the meat inside is fresh, flavorful, and sooooo juicy. The meat is all cooked over a wood fire, and the flavor they get out of the meat is just incredible. The woodfired beef, and the reina pepiada (chicken with peas and avocado and...um...stuff?)  have become my go-to favorites, and I've developed cravings for the reina. So good.   I'm pretty sure this place was the former occupant of the current Goodwich Cube outside of Dinos, but it has moved waaaaay up in the world, and now has a clean, classy restaurant with a great patio and a ton of seating just across the street, in a lot with a kitsch shop, a lingerie store, and a Bail Bondsman. Ahhhhhh Vegas.  Pros: - Holy cow the food is delicious. Get two; an old favorite and then try something new. I've never had anything bad there. - The arepas themselves are perfect. I've had arepas at other places that get this weird \"cheap poorly made cornbread\" texture to them that is not at all pleasant. That is not the case here. Something like a cross between a crumpet and a tortilla, I imagine the manna God sent from heaven was actually arepas. - Sauces. They come in two generous tubes; one's spicy, one's garlicky. Yellow bottle. Do yourself a favor and just slather that on. - This is fast lunch food that's not at all fast food. Takes about 5-10 minutes from order to eating, depending on how busy they are. Unless you order the All The Meats plate, which takes a while, and feeds 3.  - VERY affordable. You can eat a lunch that will make you full for dinner for about $12.  - Seating for 2-14 comfortably.  Cons: - The other businesses in the strip mall give me the giggles. - You will want to eat ALL THE AREPAS, all the time, which will make you very fat."}
{"text":"This guy has a lot of heart and I like how the place is improving.  They added tables and chairs, which is great for people watching.  They got rid of the bacon hot dog (wahh) but added empanadas.  I'm a fan of the cold chicken and the wine-stewed beef arepa.  Honestly, they're tasty when I'm in the neighborhood, but I won't make the trip that often (unlike my foodie friends who lost their minds over this place.)  One arepa can be enough for a light meal, but I tend to eat two."}
{"text":"Ordered the shredded chicken arepa.  It was packed with meat!  So good and fresh.  Don't forget the sauces!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic, affordable and amazing. Chicken is so good and flavorful. The arepas are amazing. Plaintains, yum. Near stratosphere."}
{"text":"Heaven! Had wood fired shredded chicken and reina papiada with sugar cane and lime juice. Did I say it was heavenly?"}
{"text":"Ok, so I read a couple of reviews where people say this is located in a scary neighborhood. Nope. Asides from a few drunks and homeless folks wandering around, It's pretty tame for Las Vegas. The dining area is pretty clean, and they just recently added an outdoor seating area in the front.  I go here at least a couple of times a month because:  - it's cheap - I don't have to think about what I'm gonna get, since I always get the same things - it's right next door to AOF  The arepas range in price from $4 for a cheese arepa to $7 for a garlic shrimp arepa. I usually stick to eating the Reina Pepiada, (chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro), or the Perico, (scrambled egg, ham & cheese, onion and tomato). If I'm not mistaken, the Reina Pepiada is the only arepa served cold. Kind of reminds me of a cold chicken salad sandwich, but with a lot more chicken.   Nice to have places like this to dine at, especially if you are budget-conscious. Beats the hell out of going to a fast food chain. For $20, you and a date can grab an arepa here with a huge order of fries, then bounce over to AOF to grab dessert. After dessert, have some fun and browse the selection of lingerie and adult novelties in the boutique next door! Cheap and convenient date options!"}
{"text":"A wonderful smell of mesquite envelopes you as.you enter.   So happy to have a permanent location and so close to home! The manager is super friendly and the food is the same amazing quality as the Strip location. It's so good. What is so good. Everything! The arepa is griddled to perfection and whatever you put inside of is going to be great.   I think the half chicken dinner is a couple dollars too cheap. We were the last customers tonight and even the last bird they served today was top notch.   The garlic cilantro mayo sauce is wonderful, especially when mixed with the hot sauce or the ketchup. Seriously. If you have fries, mix a bit with the ketchup.   The facility is sharp and they're connected to the banquet hall next door. It should seat up to 200 when it opens in December.   The drink selection includes Venezuelan sodas and some fresh drinks including a sugar cane juice and lime concoction.   Yes, Las Vegas, you can now sit down and enjoy arepas! So glad to have another great international joint in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews as I know how hard it is to run a restaurant however the meal I had here last night wasn't very exciting.  I've been to Venezuela and remember the amazing arepa bread sandwiches from my travels. How hot and delicious they were.   So when I saw this place I was so excited. Then disappointed. The breads were cold and the chicken, avocado, cilantro filling was just plain bland. The fried plantains were good.  I wanted an empanada but the deep fryer was down.   I hope I came at the wrong time and got an off meal as I love seeing ethnic restaurants succeed.   Please try them at least once and hopefully the results will be better than mine."}
{"text":"Got the #4 and #7 arepas with a side of rice and beans and two drinks for around $25.   I loved both. The texture of the arepa dough was fresh and smooth and both meats inside were so good!   First time trying Venezuelan rice and beans. The beans tasted almost like Cuban black beans. They were very well seasoned. The rice was so different from other Latin rice dishes. It was made with basmati (I think) I'm used to regular long grain rice but it was still yummy.   For drink, soursop (or guanabana) and passion fruit. I really liked how both had great, authentic fruit flavor but they were on the less sweet side.   Will come back for more lunch dates in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. First time with with the boyfriend having Venezuelan sandwiches. We tried the wood-fire chicken and the chicken arepa with avocado, and the yuca fries with chicharron. Pretty tasty eats with Venezuelan soda that tastes like bubble gum. Tasty inexpensive food and will try again."}
{"text":"Fist time here and Arepas were delicious!!! We try asada, reina pepiada arepas... but shirm arepa was out of this world.. a must try when you come to Vegas..!"}
{"text":"The worse Venezuelan food I've ever tried. I'm  ashamed to call their food \"Venezuelan\". Starting with the cheese empanadas, the terrible taste and the disgusting type of cheese. The shredded beef arepas are even worst without mention the Cachapa made out of a corn flour from a packet. Hey Mr. owner!! If you're Venezuelan make sure you represent our country in a better way!  -- La peo comida Venezolana que he probado. Me da vergüenza llamar su comida \"venezolana\". Comenzando por las Empanadas de queso, el terrible saber, y el peor tipo de queso. Las Arepas de carne mechada son incluso peores, sin mencionar las Cachapas hechas de harina de maíz dulce sacadas de un paquete. Epa Sr. Dueño! Si usted es Venezolano, asegúrese de representar a nuestro país de una mejor manera!"}
{"text":"4-stars for the food itself... though surprisingly small portions... It was very tasty tho... make sure to use the 'hot' sauce provided on the tables, very good alongside the arepas.  5-STARS for the Soursop drink... I had never ever heard of it beforehand and it was so delicious that I may just go back to this place just for that drink specifically."}
{"text":"Best arepas in the United States period. The beef aripa is my favorite with a smoky wood flavor to beef steak. Everything is good here you can't go wrong with the beef steak aripa or the chicken aripa with the green sauce. The guava drink is super fresh."}
{"text":"Best arepa I've ever had. We tried an assortment - veggie, black bean/cheese, shrimp - all delicious. The plantains were perfectly fried and sweet. The owner was so friendly and even threw in a side of yuca fries when we told him we were visiting from out of town. It's a short Uber ride away and definitely worth it. Only complaint is that it's a little warm inside, they need to crank up the AC. Everything else was perfect!"}
{"text":"Arepa! Arepa!  Stopped by this highly recommended restaurant for some South American eats.  The black bean & cheese arepa is pretty delish but the yucca fries are my absolute fave. I can't really explain the texture but of your a potato girl like myself you'll understand. (My Pescatarian friendly diet limits my menu options)  Don't forget the cilantro salsa it's sooo good and fresh every visit.  The service is quick and the food is thus far has been great!  Be Aware: The parking lot is a little sketch and homeless men have walked up on me from behind twice \"not cool\". Secure your belongings because you can never be too sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I was staying at the Stratosphere and wanted somewhere cheap to eat. I pulled this up on Yelp and it did not disappoint. It was an easy walk to the restaurant. I got the arepa de pabellon based on Yelp reviews, and it was incredible. The filling and the bread just melts in your mouth. Just one note - the arepas are very small (about the size of a slider), so if you are hungry definitely get at least 4.   This restaurant was the only redeeming thing about my stay at the Stratosphere and being this far up the strip. Eat here, it is worth it. Especially since there are not many Venezuelan arepa restaurants around."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I always went to the one downtown and was so happy to find out there was one on Rainbow only a few blocks from me. Food is so flavorful and made to order. The restaurant is super clean and the staff is always helpful"}
{"text":"LOVE the food.  I wish I could have some right now.  We had the pork butt, the slow cook beef and the chicken with creamy sauce, the friend yucca and the plantain.  The plantains were delicious.  The lady working the cash register was very nice and helpful, she recommended the chicken arepas and I'm glad I took her advise."}
{"text":"Never had arepa before.  This first experience was very nice.  The arepa was loaded and it was very filling.  Price is so reasonable.   Very friendly and clean place."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of this place. I've traveled to Colombia and this is the real deal folks. I've had arepas in Miami as well and was super duper excited when I heard that an arepas place opened up in Vegas. Beware...these little packages pack a big punch. I've tried the shredded beef, shredded chicken and roasted pork butt arepas. If you order one arepa, it's a nice snack but ordering two is like having a full meal. Everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong. My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I also had the sugar cane drink which transports me to a time when I was a small child chewing on fresh sugar cane stalks! If I lived closer, I would eat here more often. I really do love arepas."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place!! I've been lazy about getting here but now that I have I'm so happy. It was delicious!!  We ordered the garlic shrimp arepa and the chicken salad one. Fries covered in cilantro mayo.. Yes!!!   It's nothing fancy inside and it's in a old part of town but the food is worth the trip. It was $20 for 2 arepas 2 sodas and an order of fries. Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"Yelp was raving mad about Viva Las Are???.. so I jumped on the gun when I had the chance and ordered almost everything on the menu for myself and some hungery employees.  Honest to say, it was aight.. Meat to dough ratio was a little off.. there was hardly anything inside the empanadas.. and the person that was supposed to take my order just stared at me for a good 10 seconds.. and thats pretty long in staring time!  The Garlic Shrimp stood out from the rest in taste and quality but I just wasn't really a fan of the dough.  Just a little too.. doughish I guess?  I would much rather smother myself with one of 'em cheesy soft tacos at one of 'em spanish carts at one of 'em gasoline stations or one 'em tire repair shops.  Now that's a five star.. even with flies buzzn' and all!   ...not a totaltarian fan of Viva, but I can't deny that it still hit the spot."}
{"text":"A friend recommended me to visit here, and I'm glad I did! At first, I underestimated the size of the arepas here; though they're not huge, they pack huge content and are pretty heavy. Our arepas averaged about $5-6/each. We got a wood fired chicken, pork butt, wood fired beef, and an order of plantains. The wood fired beef was super tasty, while the pork and chicken were a bit salty.  I've never had arepas before, but I became a huge fan after trying these. The \"bun\" was made of a cornmeal that was grilled, and it was stuffed with a LOT of tasty meats/veggies. The Venezuelan hamburger was filling and also came with two sauces. The pork and chicken arepas got a little wet from the juices inside and started to fall apart towards the end, but were still good nonetheless. The plantains were spot on; warm, toasty, sweet, and delicious.   I'd definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. It's worth a visit and you will want to try everything!"}
{"text":"I had only tried Colombian Arepas before and of course there is no comparing they are both delicious. But I definitely fell in love with this spot and their oh so yummy food. The green sauce (not spicy just favorable) is a MIST on the Arepas. Besides the Arepas though the Cachapas were one of my favorite dishes on the menu. They kind of reminded me of Salvadorean Pie de Queso mixed with Mexican Corn tamales with a lotta delicious salty & sweet cheese in the middle. It's both salty and sweet. My sister ate her Cachapa with Hot Chocolate and I ate mine with the green sauce (which I can't remember the name of). After trying this spot out for the first time, it will immediately become one of this comfort foods you crave for a good filling and satisfies feeling."}
{"text":"Found this place as we were leaving LV. Coming from a Venezuelan, this place gets 5 stars from me.  The tequeños are huge, and reasonably priced.  Everything was fresh, made on the spot."}
{"text":"This is so amazing.  It is a little shop on Las Vegas Blvd.  There is no indoor seating, and you must sit outside.  The food is outstanding.  I always order the shredded beef arepa and the black bean and cheese  empanada when I come to vegas.  Their sauce, especially the green sauce is sooo good.  Would recommend you coming here."}
{"text":"Great prices and good food. Arepas can be tough to find! I've only had better in nyc so I'm happy this is in Vegas!  I even had some trouble finding it in LA. The area and surroundings seem a little sketchy but they keep in clean and well organized inside.   Their arepas are small but filling. It's great when they keep it simple."}
{"text":"At present, with over 1300 reviews averaging 4.5 stars, is an impressive feat. It's also enough to lure me away from my original plan of getting some BBQ nearby.    Viva Las Arepas is a Venezuelan food restaurant. It's located on the corner of a mostly industrial area that's also surrounded by fast food joints. There must be something amazing about these folks because the back wall has some media mentions on display.    Not knowing much about their cuisine, I saw that most Yelpers raved about the wood fire beef arepas. Just the name alone speaks mouth-watering meat. It seems to be a white corn shell grilled, and stuffed with chopped beef cooked over mesquite wood for that very noticeable smokiness. This is served with lettuce & tomato. It comes out blazing hot, I kid you not, so wait a minute before you burn your face.   Reina Pepeiada is the corn shell stuffed with chicken, but drenched in a cooking cilantro sauce.   Both were excellent but if I had the choose one, it'd be the wood fire beef.  Arepas come with 2 sauces. One is hotter than the other but both were great over the wood fire beef.   Fried plantains were decent, but very heavy. They come out blazing hot and stay that way for a while.   We also tried the 'drink of the day' strawberry juice.  Just the right amount of sweet and very refreshing. A refill for 2 bucks, and tried the passion fruit.  A bit tart so it's really not my fav.    Service was pleasant. The lady at the counter knew it was obviously our first time so she was patient in explaining things.   It's very casual here. Orders are placed at the counter and your name called when order is ready.  Photos of their menu items line the perimeter of the frame right below the ceiling and there are 4 TV's covering each corner of the dining area.  Stacks of mesquite wood can be seen towards the restroom.   I'm also giving Viva Las Arepas a 4.5, but can't justify rounding up to a 5, since it's not exactly perfect in every way.  But without a doubt, I'll be back for more of that smoky wood fire beef."}
{"text":"Let's just say this is not my favorite place. The arepas are really dense and is not all that good. I had the #7 Reina Pepiada (chicken breast mixed with avocado, mayo, and cliantro). I thought this one for the most part was alright and nothing spectacular, but it became a chore to eat after the 4th or 5th bite. I also had the #3 Shredded Beef which was mixed with bell peppers, onion and tomato. The #3 was my least favorite of the two. My first thought of this when I bit into it was that the meat tasted exactly like the meat you would get from Taco Bell. That is not a good sign. Now, I normally like Taco Bell as fast food if a real Mexican place isn't close to me. However, when you think of a Latino cuisine and you get Taco Bell as your first thought, there are issues. I came here on the recommendation of a friend and he has questionable tastes in food. I knew that about him before coming here. Coming here confirms it."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor!  The price is very good! 6$ arepas, empanadas 3$ The mango water is delicious.  Beef empanadas are amazing.  I love how the meat is cooked in front of you with 0 oil! BBQ with wood. Everything Tastes so good!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, great food, fair price!    A good balance of both LV area locals (like me) & visitors from out of town who've found out about the place & are wanting to get good food without the pretentiousness & prices of touristy places  this is my second time here in less than a week, and even though my belly is full (I'm writing this review while still seated inside the restaurant), I'd be happy to come back again tomorrow.  As a vegetarian, I get the vegetarian arepa (adding cheese) as well as an avocado, tomato, onions, peppers & cheese arepa (minus peppers & tomatoes), but they do have plenty of options with meat.  Even the French fries are good here!  The neighborhood is... well, not the best, but the place is on the busy Las Vegas Blvd, a couple blocks N of the Stratosphere.     Ideally, you'll get here via vehicle.  Once inside, the place is very clean & friendly."}
{"text":"No longer a food stand, Viva Las Arepas is now a brick and mortar restaurant.  I'm glad for it.  It gets hot in Vegas and this food deserves to be eaten year round.  They've added a lot of things to the menu...most noteworthy being a variety of grilled meats and some fantastic side dishes.  Have had the pork ribs, rotisserie chicken, rice, and hand cut fries.  They're all fantastic.  The arepas continue to be amazing as well.   You really can't go wrong.  My quibble with the food stand was underseasoning.  This no longer seems to be an issue.  Everything is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great spot and now we no longer have to drip to the Strip for it. Chicken and avocado arepas are great as is their smoked chicken. Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"First time trying Venezuelan food, having read a lot of good reviews on yelp, I was not disappointed!   The place is very unassuming from the outside, i have actually passed by this area multiple times before and I never noticed it. Inside, I was surprised by how spacious it was.   I ordered the reina pepiada (chicken w mayo and avocado) and fries on the side, and it was delicious! It's like a burger, almost, except its made of thick flour bread (like tortilla, just a lot thicker and meatier). It was delicious and i will be back."}
{"text":"Stop what you are doing and go get an Arepa at Viva Las Arepas now, and thank me later.   I live 30 minutes away from this place, it's on the strip, and I have driven there three times in the past three weeks to sample more of their delicious Venezuelan morsels.   The food is out of control. If you've never had an Arepa, it is a Venezuelan take on the taco. The key here is that the shell is a pillowy flatbread. That bread wraps around some of the most flavorful, tender and mind-blowing meats I have ever sampled. My two favorites are the #1 (wood-fired beef) and the #7 (Reina pepiada... A chicken salad). The beef is cooked perfectly and the spices are just right. And in case they are not flavorful enough, you can Doctor them up with their spicy green pepper sauce or a creamy avocado sauce. Honestly, the #1 is just right for me but occasionally I'll take a bit of the sauces because they are really good.   I loved the ribs. They had a good crispy skin but they were falling off the bone. The empanadas are a great accompaniment to whatever arepa you choose. And don't skip dessert. They have pastelitos in two flavors. One is guava and cheese and the other is coconut. I'm not a huge guava fan but the coconut one was ridiculous.   So far, I have been with my wife on a date, once with our three kids and once with a few friends. It was a great spot for all three outings. It's casual, and you don't have to worry if your group is a little rowdy. It is on the strip but it's north of Sahara so it's not crazy busy and there is parking all around the building."}
{"text":"Still a total 5 stars in my book! Went back recently and had the pork spare ribs with 2 sides only $8.99! It was fall off the bone good. They give u 4 huge ribs. You barely have to bite the meat just falls off and is so tasty. The wood smoked flavor is excellent. As my sides I got a salad and black beans. I loved the salad. The house dressing was tangy and filled with cilantro flavor. I can't wait to go back and have the ribs again and of course try other items off their menu."}
{"text":"The the sweet corn and cheese as well as the guava and cheese were to die for!!! I did order a shredded chicken empanada but they gave me beef,  I had the woodfire beef and it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely, by far, one of my most favorite places to eat. When I can't think of anything in particular I am craving, I always come here. I like the vegetarian arepa. Can't go wrong with that one! I've tried their guava desert too. It's also good. This place never fails. The management is always so nice. He recognizes me and welcomes me back every time. They have an app too! Buy 10 arepas, get one free. You know I got that! :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I've tried authentic Venezuelan food before trying out this place. But I have to admit I don't know how much I'd like it after eating here! It made me fall in love with Venezuelan cuisine!   When I came it was just a food hut on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming, but now I hear it's actually branched out and opened as a restaurant just a walk away from it. I guess it has turned into a hot dog stand now.   Anyway, you can get both cold and hot arepas. They are decently priced, ranging from $2 - $5 so obviously you can't just have one! But before you go all crazy and order everything off the menu, let me tell you they can be quite filling! I would suggest two of them and an empanada constituting a full meal. I've tried the Roasted Pork Butt with tomato slices - FANTASTIC, beef tongue arepa - FANTASTIC times 2, and the Reina Pepiada which is chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise, and cilantro - not as good as the beef arepas, but still tasty. I have also tried their empanadas. Really really good. Make sure to try the arepas with the special sauces they have for you to use.   This place overall is the best place to go before a night out downtown for a quick, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious meal."}
{"text":"I had the #2) Wood Fire chicken Arepa & #7)Reina Pepiada chicken Arepa both are good but my absolute favorite was #7 it had so much more flavor and I love the creamy cilantro dressing it comes with. The service was fantastic! I was ordering WAY too much when the guy helping me asked how many ppl it was for? when I told him 2 he gasped and said it was way too much food for 2 ppl! Thank goodness he told me because after taking a few things out of my original order I still had more than enough =) I also had the Kiwi Agua Fresca and that was very good as well. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Reasonable prices. Delicious food. Plenty of seating. Plenty of parking. Patio seating available. Great location. Off the strip but not too far."}
{"text":"Never had Venezuelan food and now I'm a big fan! My boyfriend ordered the pork spareribs bbq which was amazing!  I was so excited to try this place out, I didn't take much notes but I'm definitely coming back!  Sorry not so helpful but you've gotta try this place out!  The staff, awesome! Keeping it short and sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious! Being Colombian, my family makes a lot of Arepas but never like this. They take Arepas and stuff them full of avocado, beans, meats, peppers, spices, and more. The quality is top notch and the staff are really friendly. They have the menu in both Spanish and English so you don't feel embarrassed ordering.  I had the Vegetarian Arepa and it was really good, fresh black beans, sliced avocado, tomatoes, and more. The sauce they provide you is also homemade.  The only reason for 4 stars, instead of 5 was the lack of a drink dispenser or I didn't see it. Either way it was incredible and I will surely be back to give them a hand full of money."}
{"text":"This post is after my second visit to Viva Las Arepas!  The food is so fresh! I ordered the vegetarian option. They also serve vegan options. The menu includes a wide range of fresh-made flour sandwiches, dishes, & desserts. Agua Fresca in passion fruit is super yummy and thirst quenching! The ambiance is wonderful. Warm and bright tones fill the room with orange and yellow. The staff is super helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Restrooms are super clean and selfie worthy! Prices are amazingly affordable. The servings are extremely filling and proportionate. I'll definitely be coming here a lot more in the future. Two thumbs up for this awesome food spot (:"}
{"text":"Love it.    3rd time here.  Delicious.  Menu is in English and Spanish.  Yes, it's a hole in a wall place, but they started off in a food cart/ stand.  So it's a matter of time before they have multiple locations in Vegas and elsewhere.   Must try when you are here  in Vegas."}
{"text":"Shrimp Arepas!!!!Delicious.  Got the usual shredded beef arepas.  Nice clean location."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed not only with the product, but also the knowledgable and friendly service. We tried the wood fire beef, pork and chicken items and all were very tasty.   Note that if you eat a lot you'd have a order a bunch, but the quality is good and the flavors are rich. In Vegas it's usually all about the quantity, but for this authentic Venezuelan cheap eats it's about taste.   The food comes out quick and it comes with a variety of sauces from mild to spicy. Parking lot is shared and small, but if you come during off hours there shouldn't be a problem. It's a place my wife really liked and they were very accommodating to her food allergies.   It's a place I'd go back to...just not on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"This was good experience for our first time trying arepas.  My kiddos both got chicken which seemed to not have a lot of good flavor, but the shredded beef I had was the favorite for everyone(each had to try a bite). I added cheese and avocado to mine.  The chachapas was really good and everyone loved it as a sweet savory shared side."}
{"text":"The BF and I were close and needed some snackies.   We ordered a pork arepa, 2 bean and cheese empanada and mango to drink.   The mango drink was really good. It was not too sweet, fresh and refreshing. I coulda had a few of those since it was a hot day.   When our order came it was the wrong order. We got one meat arepa and a bean and cheese arepa so we figured maybe she didn't hear the empanada part and perhaps got us a arepa instead? Oh well, we'll eat it anyways.   The bean and cheese was yummy with flavorful beans. The meat turned out to be beef (unless my taste buds are wonky) but it was so tender and fantastic. Normally shredded beef is somewhat stringy, but not this. I normally wouldn't order beef but here I would definitely consider it. The arepa was wonderfully crispy on the outside and had some chewiness inside that was addictive. I can eat those alone even. Don't skimp on the mustardy hot sauce and the creamy sauce as both make the arepas even better, I think!   Eventually I guess they realized it wasn't that they got our order wrong, we got someone elses order! The guy on the grill (I'm assuming is the owner) was apologetic about it and gave us 2 bean and cheese empanadas anyways which was cool of him. It was not what I expected at all. I was thinking more like pastry dough type empanadas, but the consistency was like the breading that is around corn dogs which lead the BF and I trying to figure out how they make it. These were tasty but since I'm a Hot Dog On the Stick fan, I'm definitely ordering just a plain cheese one next time.   Now that its hot, it's gonna suck to come visit but I definitely enjoyed that meal and want to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Every foodie has a checklist of things that they want to try.  Being from a smallish city there isn't a plethora of Venezuelan restaurants.  Thats why when i discovered Viva Las Arepas, i was excited.  I will admit that it can be overwhelming walking into a restaurant with a different culture than your own.  I was unfamiliar with many of the ingredients, however, the staff was very helpful.  I ordered the shrimp and my sister order the pork.  The texture of the bun was unlike anything i had tried in the past.  It somewhat resembled an english muffin, but the sides were griddled so they were super crispy, and the inside was supple.  I got mine spicy, and got it topped with avocado, just incase the heat was too overbearing.  The whole package was just wonderful.  Now anyone would fear eating something and then noticing a mystery ingredient suddenly appear, which happened to me.  After closer observation, there were two bonus chunks of lobster, which i will welcome anytime.   Overall, i loved my lunch, it was flavourful, authentic, and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I walked into this place really hungry and all I could feel were my eyes burning almost tearing. Whatever they had cooking in the kitchen, perhaps onions made it unpleasant.  I ordered chicken thighs rice and beans, and a guava cheese pastry. I couldn't stand the burning eyes trauma any longer and waited outside by the patio area until my food was ready.   Very disappointing, I expected several whole chicken thighs and I got boneless skinless dry chicken. The flavor tasted like charred tasteless chicken and I had to request ketchup just to flavor it up a little. The rice and beans were ok, but not very tasty. Had it not been for the dessert, this place would have flopped! I truly did enjoy the guava cheese pastry. The moist and flaky pastry with guava and cheese filling was delicious and tasty.   Overall, the place had a nice ambiance and the service was excellent. The air quality and venting needs a makeover to ensure customers truly dine in, not outside."}
{"text":"Las Vegas best kept secret !!! Every time I go to Vegas, this is my first stop.   Directions are off on yelp, on account of address confusion.   Route yourself to 1616 Las Vegas blvd South and you will arrive there. Close to Stratosphere.  If you follow regular directions, it says it's on other side if town. If your directions say hour away no good.   Best food in Town ! City !  County ! State !"}
{"text":"I literally dream about this place. If I lived in Vegas, I would be here weekly. On a 4 night Vegas stay, my girlfriends and I visited here twice!  I got the vegetarian with maduros added, the guava empanada and the passion fruit juice. Literally the perfect meal.  There is nothing bad to say about this place. Stop reading reviews and go already!!"}
{"text":"Unique and delicious smoked food. Bathroom not so much, but super friendly. Even when I asked for a to-go box because I didn't realize one arepa is very filling per person, the guy added sauces and extras and bagged it up for me. Tried the pork, beef, and chicken versions and all very good."}
{"text":"My brother in law told me about this place and I just happened to have the time to come here before my flight leaves tiday. One word, BOMBBBBB! I love this place, got the ropa vieja arepas w avacado , tomato and lettuce. Super good! Also got the yucca fries, fried to perfection! Got some empenadas to go, yeeeehaaa!"}
{"text":"This place was on our bookmarks and we're trying to get them checked off before 2015 but when I keep adding more it doesn't help! Haha. We came on a Friday night and I was surprised to only see a few people eating here. Maybe I thought they would be busier because it's a Friday and there Fairly close to downtown but I think everyone was next door at Art of flavors. The warm bright colors make you feel welcome instantly. I knew I wanted an arepa and my guy had never heard of the please do went with a chicken plate. The pork on the pork butt arepa was succulent and juicy. Paired well with the cilantro garlic sauce. The plantains themselves were slightly mushy and soft. I guess I was expecting more of a crispy exterior. They still were buttery warm and comforting. I didn't mind at all. The chicken plate he orders came with 3 pieces of chicken thighs with 2 sides. He went with rice and beans. The chicken itself had a good seasoning in the outside and a crispy char from the open fire. It was a little dark but I like my meat cooked that way anyway. To some it might seemed burnt. Overall the food was pretty good and the hot sauce they gave was really good. Paired well with all the flavors. I would definitely come back and try some more arepas."}
{"text":"Ate here about midnite on Sat/14 June: - $9.99 for the spare ribs + 2 sides platter.  Great deal and lots of food.   - $.99 for a can of Coke.  For Venezualan soda, coupla choices at $2 and $2.50. - All prices have taxes already included."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is Great and the people here are friendly. My favorite on the menu is the Arepa Reina Pepiada...so delicious."}
{"text":"I am sitting here waiting for my 2nd to go sandwich to be ready. I ordered a carne asada arepa not even 10 minutes ago. Being that it was my first time here, Ivan helped me and offered to let me taste the meat without me asking. I was sold! The beef was so tender and full of flavor. Instead of waiting for our food to be ready, we headed next door to Art of Flavors for some yummy gelato. When we got back, our order was ready. We literally devoured that sandwich in the parking lot and was left wanting more, so I decided to go back and get another one hahaha. So here I am again. I'm glad we finally tried this place out. If everything else on their menu is as good as that sandwich and service then unarguably this establishment deserves 5 stars. I guess my only complaint is that, it's kinda messy to eat the arepas especially if you're on the go. Can't wait to come back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good at this location. I got carne asada arepa that was very, very greasy. I asked with avocado & only got two very small slices as to which they charge extra. I also got the shredded chicken empanada which was bland. I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"\"Oh baby, it's not nice to tease.  You may be corny but you're so warm and smell so good  you got me yearning.  Now you're gonna get it!\"  Wrapper  torn open, first giant mouthwatering bite.  Ahhh.  We're talking arepas and this new location on Rainbow continues to deliver, matching the quality of the LV Blvd location with even friendlier service.  Essentially a reconstituted milled sweet corn fried bread (masarepa flour, salt, water), split then stuffed with everything from wood fire grilled, well seasoned beef to a roasted pulled pork, to tender black beans and melting cheese.  All three by the way are very good.  Adding optional additional cheese, avocado, and squirts of their Venezuelan style salsa further kicks up the flavor.  Top props to the arepa pabellon, a right fine combo of the grilled beef, black beans, fried plantains, and cheese.  An order of fried tostones (pressed, fried  plantains) or fried yucca makes a perfect, starchy side.  While they may look small, don't be fooled, these babies are dense and stuffed.  Very reasonably priced, around $5.50 - $8.00 with all the possible additions.  Simple and solid."}
{"text":"For those of you needing delicious food that is also GLUTEN FREE, look no further!   The peina arepa was absolutely delicious and inexpensive!  The sauces they give on the side are also phenomenal! I am just ecstatic about it but only wish I had this place back home!"}
{"text":"Yummy cheap street eats. It's a happening food truck without the wheels, no need to follow em' on twitter, they are here to stay. I am in no way shape or form an expert on the food of Venezuela, but I know delish when I taste it, and there are some mighty fine treats coming out of this window. I sampled strictly the Arepas. What the heck is an Arepa? Kind of a grilled corn shell, like a mash up of a sope and papusa, but hand sliced down the middle like a hamburger bun. After that just pick the  filling(s) you want and enjoy. I particularly like the black bean and cheese and the tongue. Perico is the kitchen sink and really good too. Don't forget that crazy good green sauce, don't worry, it's not hot, but does burst with flavor. Arepas run $2.75-$4.00 Empanadas are $1.99 Venezy drinks are $1.49-dude hooked me up with free refills, don't know if that's the norm though. I tried 2 beverages Parchita which is a very sweet fruit punch thing, and the star by far was the Guanabana drink, which comes from the native southern hemisphere fruit of the same name. Very light, clean and refreshing taste. Bonus, they claim only fresh ingredients and no MSG, no microwave, and no can openers."}
{"text":"We took a bus to come here to escape the busy downtown area on Monday evening, when it looked like every restaurant in the strip was swamped with people. And this place was such a pleasant surprise. So glad that we came here."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try arepas for a while and I finally got the chance to. I tried a few different flavors. I was a bit disappointed because the arepas are dry and flavorless. I wasn't impressed. What happened?! I have no idea... A few friends rave about this place. I also tried the empanadas and plantains. They were just okay. Nothing special.   I'm rarely in this area these days, so I'm less likely to give this place another chance. We'll see.  2017 Yelp Challenge Review #4"}
{"text":"I love arepas and I've only had them at one place in LA. I was excited that my Venezuelan friends know about this place and actually recommend it. I came with my friend that has never had arepas and he loved it. If you don't know what arepas are... then Google it because I already explained what they are on my Amara review lol.  Reina Pepiada - Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro. This was a lot different from the one I had in LA. The chicken breast is chopped and minced so finely that its almost like a paste - I prefer chicken cubes or chunks for a bite. Really good though.  Pabellón - Beef, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese. This is my go to. I love the sweet plantains paired with the salty cheese. The beef was super tender and juicy.  Really good place for affordable and quick meal. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Having family from Venezuela this place made you feel like you were back home. Cachapas were the best."}
{"text":"I love Arepas is an understatement and the name of the tastiest food establishment I have eaten at that serves South American-specifically Argentinian cuisine- since I left Texas. Made me homesick. I ordered the marinated roasted pork butt Arepas and the black bean and cheese Arepas along with a mango juice. Later on, Felix, the owner and chef (genius) made me a black bean and cheese Empenada that was the size of a banana. I was so stuffed. My mouth and my stomach have not been this happy all at once and for hours afterwards in a long time! I can't wait to eat there again. Which will be soon because I go to karaoke at Dino's and I Love Arepas is located in the same parking lot! How convenient for me! WOOO HOOO! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Hmmm, I forgot to ask if he does breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem... full of construction out front when we went, but still open.  Smelled heavenly and tasted about the same. We had no idea what we were ordering so the pictures around the walls were helpful.  The last item on the list (#13 I believe) is different than the rest and bigger.... the corn and cheese was delicious!!  We also got pork and chicken.  Both great. Nice place for a quick meal, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great food at inexpensive prices...one of the best ways to fill up for under $10!  I've tried quite a bit of goodies here, but I will talk about my favorites!  Wood Fired Beef Arepas ($5). Love the smokey flavor in the meat...it's delicious! I think their wood fired chicken and beef are my favorites here...chicken is a dollar cheaper.  Chicharron and Yuca Frita ($5.99). Delicious! Well done fried pork, with very flavorful fried yuca...imagine a very flavorful starchy french fry! Yummy   And the Reina Pepiada ($5): Chicken Breast, Avocado, Mayo and Cilantro.  This is delicious and works so well together.  I love pouring their hot sauce all over this beast!  And I ALWAYS finish up with Art of Flavors next door for dessert!  Even if you can't eat fresh homemade gelato, order a Spiced Hot Cocoa and you WILL thank me later :P  I will be back...many more times!  Pics :"}
{"text":"OK this place is amazing! This is our second time here when we visit Las Vegas. We have decided every time we visit we must always go. The people are friendly and the food is phenomenal. The arepas are full of flavor and there sauces are divine. I like the creamy one especially. My favorite arepa so far is #7 its a must and then the pernil arepa with avocado. The only thing is the tostones are okay they could be thinner and more crisp in my opinion. I'm puerto Rican and thats how I'm use to it. Aside from that Its perfect and we will always come back!"}
{"text":"It's about 6:45 I came to eat at one of my all time favorite places to eat. I don't think I will be back after today. I saw a rodent three times in the 10 minutes I was there. I can't believe it. I have a picture that shows proof of my words. Be careful."}
{"text":"Umm.. yes please. If you're ever near downtown area and only have a few bucks in your pocket but want a warm filling meal, get over to Viva Las Arepas. They are super filling, I always order 2 cause I can't decide on 1, and end up being SO full. But yes, pretty much any option you choose is going to be made with love and flavor and affordable. So please enjoy! The actual restaurant is typical \"fast food\" style but with a patio, So I usually like to order to go and eat it in bed when I'm hungover ;P"}
{"text":"Having never heard of an arepa before, Katrina M. quickly introduced me to one on a drunken night. Prior to going into the adjacent Dino's, I was ordered a Reina Pepiada - a masa cake stuffed with a cold combination of chicken, mayo, avocado, and peas. Even in sober retrospect, that was a damn great meal.   Another karaoke excursion brought a large group of us back to I Love Arepas. Ordering a myriad of arepas and empanadas, my favorites were the Roasted Pork Leg/Butt (moist, flavorful without unnecessary frills) and the Garlic Shrimp (showcasing the masa in its lightness). However, the sauces make the arepas infinitely better. There were two: a creamy green that was mild, and a more concentrated green that added spice in all the right ways. My only disappointment was in the codfish arepa - salty, fishy, and an added upset to the booze I just ingested.   The best part about this place, other than the arepas? The price! I swear, for under five bucks per arepa, I am not conscious of my broke college finances. The price and the amazing food make I Love Arepas the content of my dreams for the past week, with the only way to cease them is to visit again."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here after drinks at some bar downtown. Food is cheap and so delicious. Tried the empanadas, could've devoured about 20 of them and still dreaming about them a week later. Bad part is that it's in a sketchy area but it is what it is. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian arepa I had here was the best thing I ate in Vegas.  And it was only $5!!  My bus fare to get to Viva Las Arepas cost more than my lunch, but totally worth it.    After I finished my arepa, I considered getting another one to go, but knew that if I did I'd just end up eating it on the bus ride back to my hotel and given how crowded the bus is, that didn't seem like a good idea.  Go here."}
{"text":"I have been coming here, to this specific location, for a few years now and I'm sad to say that it is not what it once was. If I had reviewed this place 4 or 5 years ago, 5 stars all around. But now, obviously, not so much.   Some of the staff has moved to their second location, too. This includes Alex, who was always the cashier. She was always so sweet and smiling! And totally on top of things. I miss her! :(   The last time I went in, the new (to me) younger guy at the counter gave away my takeout order last time. $35+ worth of food. 3 arepas and an order of yucca with chicharron. He didn't realize it until 15 minutes later and I had to wait around longer for my order. Not even an apology (because I don't have a life or to go back to work or anything, right?) and the food was meh. He was pushy and borderline rude, but in that weird, polite way.   The wood fired beef was oily, the shredded beef was on point as usual, as was the pabellon with no cheese. However, the yucca fries with chicharron are usually a highlight for me but were a disappointment. They used to give you a medium sized, rectangular box full of big, juicy fried pieces of meat and yucca. Now, the box is half that size but the same price with the yucca and chicharron declining in size as well. For $6.99??? I felt ripped off when I cracked the box open only to find that it was my side and not my single arepa.. womp womp.  I'm gonna check out the second location and even though I don't really want to come back here, I probably will. Hopefully I will be able to bump this place up in stars again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with deliciously prepared food! Enjoyable flavor and experience, definitely a must eat when in Vegas."}
{"text":"After 3 visits, this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It's not fancy, maybe it's not the place to celebrate a special occasion but the food is incredible. I visited last year as a non-meat eater and loved it. This trip, we are here for one night only and visited for both dinner and breakfast. There are no breakfast-y items on the menu...it's the same all day, but I knew I wouldn't be having it for a long time and doubled up.   I couldn't wait to visit as a carnivore. I asked the cashier what I might order and he gave me 2 amazing samples of beef. The wood fired beef is juicy and flavorful. We had it in an arepa and the flavors were muted. I'd suggest going for the plate of it where it can shine on its own.   Turns out my favorite 3 items are vegetarian. Surprise!  The corn and cheese arepa is a guilty please extraordinaire. It worked for dinner as well as breakfast and is equally fantastic alone or with a dab of the special mayo.   The fried plantains are sweet and mushy, cooked perfectly. The caramelization gives a nice bit of chew to offset the wonderful mushy texture. Mushy may be bad with most veggies, but in this case it's very appealing.   I don't remember the name of the cheesy bread stick that's off to the side of the menu. A little unassuming thing, it's like a doughnut with cheese and is 100 times better than my explanation.   For breakfast today we ordered the three items above and subbed in the chicken salad arepa for the beef. This was way too much food for the two of us for breakfast. My luck friend swears by it and my husband remembered loving it last year so I figured I needed to try it. Was it really good?  Indeed, it was. Just not AS good as my favorite 3 things. In all fairness, those would be pretty hard to beat.   Food is cooked to order and service has been good on every visit. There is plenty of seating and the restaurant has been very clean on each visit.   I love Viva las Arepas!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SPECTACULAR! ! My goodness where to begin? Mom &Pop authentic Venezuelan cuisine.  Very clean, and prompt service. The empanadas (chicken and beef) were of the best ive had, careful they are super hot in tempature when served. The Arepas are to die for! The pork butt melts in your mouth and the chicken salad w cilantro mayo is bomb. Ill be back !"}
{"text":"The staff was AMAZING! This was my 1st time having Venezuelan food and it did not disappoint! Go check it out! #yum"}
{"text":"This place has some wonderful food! The Arepas are filled with crispy pork and the sauces that comes with them are delicious! I love the spicy sauce, I think it may have habaneros in it, it burned my lips in a good way! Then I was cooled off with the avocado cream sauce. The chicken was beyond delicious. Don't forget to try the ribs, I mean fall off the bone. Oh, I almost forgot the plantains were like little sweets fried pockets. I love the cheese Empanadas and the Tequenos (fried cheese sticks) my daughter said next time we need a dozen. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I've been to the Vegas blvd location twice and enjoyed it.  Now my first visit to the new location was truly exceptional as well.  I love the empanadas and the Arepas."}
{"text":"Great spot!!!! The number 12 is awesome and the carne asada in the #1 is perfectly flavored with real mesquite wood.  Came here with the family, everyone ordered something different and everyone was very happy.  Restaurant is very clean and the staff really take pride in their work.  Definitely make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a coworker I was in the mood for something new and original yet tasty and fresh. Located in an innocuous spot 10 minutes from the strip in an older rundown area inside you'll find a cleanly decorated Venezuelan cafe. The decor is simple, lined with pictures that will impress you with the number of dishes you couldn't name. But in my opinion that's what makes it so exciting. Arepas is their signature food, \"arepas\" being a corn based flour that offers a huge variety of combinations of cheese and meats. Reina Pepiada is a mouthwatering blend of chicken and avocado and the corn based bread is such a great consistency and taste not overpowering and it's as soft as cornbread. They had freshly squeezed no sugar added juice as well as a desert of hot guava with cheese in a fried shell. For dessert right next door is a just as unique and tasty ice cream store with fresh and fun flavors using goat cheese and churros! All in all a great date spot that'll show how cultured and adventurous you are :)"}
{"text":"So good. The bread wrap is tasty and whatever you choose to fill it with will be tasty. I got two because Im a hungry vegetarian and they filled me up. That white sauce is bomb if you get it to go make sure you get the two sauces, green sauce is hot but not really, good flavor and mild-med heat."}
{"text":"This place is good.   I have eaten here several times. I don't like this place when it's too busy, as it gets loud and crowded, and in my experiences the staff will not say a word to them about keeping the volume at a decent level. That alone prevents me from eating there as often as I'd like to.   It's definitely NOT a first date place- unless you're under 30 maybe.  And they only have 100% Venezuelan items on the menu.   That said, they are polite enough, and the prices are fair and the food is tasty. Nice outdoor patio dining. But ultimately, this place is all about the arepas. Which are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Solid diverse menu but not overwhelming. 2-3 will fill you up and give you a chance to try new things. Both sauces they bring to the table are also quite tasty. Make sure you don't forget the fries plantains for dessert!"}
{"text":"The last time I had arepas was like 8 years ago when I lived in Utah, so I was excited to hit this joint up w/my man who grew up eating these things in Miami.  It was a short walk; but also in the blistering heat,so by the time we got there I was a bit of a cranky pants. Arepas couldn't be customized since the ingredients were already pre-mixed so I was ready to write-off getting one all together, but the man working the counter patiently led my onion-abhoring self to a couple options that did not include them. I went for the ground beef & cheese (not super exciting sounding) and my man the ham & cheese one. We also ordered beef & cheese and guava &cheese pepiadas, as well as a sugarcane and a passion fruit drink.   The drinks were delicious and ~ice~ cold -- making the hot yet quick stroll back to the stratosphere bearable, and dare I say even enjoyable? Once we got inside we dug into our food -- everything was awesome! The arepas were overflowing with filling, I would have preferred shredded beef to ground...but since Im a picky bitch I was at least happy with what I had. The pepiadas were amazing, so much so I didn't really want to share. All the sauces that come with  are tasty and add great extra flavor and kick as well.  I was super happy with this meal. It was cheap, fast, and tasty. Honestly -- I found a lot of food in Las Vegas mediocre, but Viva La Arepas was the first honest to goodness great meal I had while visiting the city. I would totally make it a point to come back if I am ever in town again."}
{"text":"Two words: Hot Pockets. Within one block you have dive bar karaoke, custard, a strip club, and now, Hot Pockets!! This has to be one of the greatest corners in Las Vegas. What more could you need?  Arepas are hot pockets of goodness, unless of course you go with the cold ingredients. They are a bit like a cornbread sandwich, as it is a corn dough. I have sampled the black bean and chicken, and I will say that I prefer the chicken. I have not perfected the right amount to order, as they make you really full quickly, but then shortly after you may find yourself snacky again, so my advice: overeat. I think that if you can you should do your best to eat at least 3. Or, just be content with a little snack and have one.  They are served up fresh and hot, and this is a food stand, so expect to sit outside and eat. The service is incredibly friendly and on top of customer service. Special orders do not upset them, and they actually gave my pal an extra empanada because one cracked!  I am a fan of their mango juice. It isn't too sweet and is the perfect refreshing treat to balance the heat of being on a corner in Las Vegas eating a hot pocket.   I Love Arepas should definitely be on your \"must try\" list of Vegas experiences and eats."}
{"text":"Heat areas here and the prices are good. I got the one with shredded beef in it and it took every ounce of will power that I had not to go back and order two or three more,LOL."}
{"text":"First time trying Venezuelan food and for me it was satisfying because most of the food was BBQ style and fresh. On top of that, I'm a fan of Latin American food and always willing to try different cuisines. I recommend their carne asada arepas."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas to eat! The food here is AMAZING and it's a real hidden gem of Las Vegas. All of their foods from their empanadas to their arepas and even their wood fire chicken is spectacular. Their food is all full of flavor and every time I eat here it's a treat. Their prices are very good and the service is always wonderful. I've been eating here since they were a tiny sandwich shop with outdoor seating and now they are a full sit-down restaurant up the street. I look forward to eating here every time I go and I always tell friends about the place too."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in all of Las Vegas.  As a local, this place is exactly what I want.  Just unknown enough, hole in the wall enough, but on the strip so I can take out of towners.  Love everything here.  I order too much food every time."}
{"text":"So good! I had a cachapa, which is the sweet corn wrapper around a cheese filling and a wood fired chicken arepa."}
{"text":"Great find near the stratosphere along Las Vegas boulevard.  Excellent and authentic food.  Very inexpensive. A clean establishment with perfect service to match.  Highly recommended to all."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Viva Las Arepas two days in a row while in Vegas! We got the pabellón arepa and a carne mechada empanada the first day and the Reina pepiada, tostones, and Chicharrones and fried yuca the second day. All with fresh strawberry juice, jugo de fresa! Deliciousness topped off with their homemade salsas. The salsa de ajo was the best. Btw, my husband is Venezuelan and said this was the most authentic food he's had in the states."}
{"text":"They were really friendly and helpful when we got there. We got the carne asada, shredded beef and garlic shrimp arepas. The shredded beef was the best one. We also tried the shredded beef empanadas which was really yummy. We got guava and cheese pastelitos for dessert which was ok. The soda was pricey though at $1.50 a can."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Tried two kinds of arepas, both of them were good. Also had a shredded beef empanada.  The meat was to die for. Had a mango drink and plantains too. Everything was great. I never had Venezuelan food before. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm! they are so good and cheap, the best place to get good food in vegas is away from the strip . A definite must try if in Vegas you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service - Nice and fast.  Price - A bit expensive but good quality.  Location - Strip mall between downtown and North end of the strip.  Plenty of parking.  Very clean restaurant, plenty of seating and restroom.  Food - 1. Wood Fire Chicken Arepas- Very good, and filling.  2. Pulled Pork Arepas - Very good, and filling.  3. Guava Cheese Pastelitos - One small pastelitos pastry for $2.  A bit expensive.  Piping hot and lots of guava jam.  Only one small sliver of cheese. 4. Passion Fruit Juice - A tad tart but very refreshing."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to see this restaurant has opened up a second location in the northwest! Same exact delicious menu as the original. For anyone who hasn't tried Venezuelan food, this is the place to start! Has lots of vegetarian options, as well as really good BBQ and gluten free items. Something for everyone! Food is so fresh and high quality, and the service is wonderful. Nice people! They deliver too, via Postmates."}
{"text":"I like it. We didn't know what to order so we asked the cashier what she recommended. She said we needed to try the Arepas number 3, 7, and 12. We also wanted to try the the cheese empanadas. Try at least one of each! They are fantastic. I included a pic of the cheese empanadas. Put some of those sauces on them and you have a winning situation!!"}
{"text":"I guess i didn't order the right arepas, the ones i ordered were just okay...had the carne asada arepa and  the chicken with avocado salsa with plantains. The prices are decent, place is clean hard to park.. Overall, if you have not had an arepa.. a place to try."}
{"text":"If you live in Vegas and you haven't had the privilege to try this AUTHENTIC Venezuelan food, what are you waiting for?? The wood fired chicken is full of flavor, moist, tender DELICIOUS. Large portion of food with a side of rice and beans ( opted out on the beans and had a salad instead), the rice was sooooo good as was the salad. We also had the chicken arepa, which was very tasty as well. Will I go back? Absolutely. Great customer service, the woman taking the order was so gracious and happy to hear how much we enjoyed the food. Very clean establishment, not in the best neighborhood and the parking is for the birds, but worth the hassle."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance where I work and I know that most places around are expensive. On a nice day like today I took a walk and yelp led me to this little shop and I'm very impressed. The place was very clean and the staff was courteous. Once I came back to work with my order in hand, I was amazed on how good the food was. I will definitely be stopping there more often."}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas es mi ir a por su excelente comida Venezualan ! Este lugar está escondido en el barrio de Las Vegas , pero si usted tiene los cajones ir usted no será defraudado ! A pie de altura , cabeza en alto como un hombre blanco loco y que será tratado a algunos de los más sorprendentes de tacos que las cosas que usted puede imaginarse . Algunos de la mejor carne asada que he tenido y que he tener algún buen conocimiento de mierda en eso. Mi chica caliente y yo pedimos unas cuantas cositas diferentes harina de arepa y unos plátanos . Sabor a sabor a sabor !! Incluso me olvidé de mirar a su alrededor para los personajes oscuros que estaba tan en mis arepas !! Hugo Chávez puede ser un pene , pero sus tíos más puede hacer un poco de comida irreal !! Viva Las Arepas y pinatas !!!  Translation: Unreal f*king good and no grammar check needed!!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Reasonably priced and everything tasted fresh. The owner was super nice and inviting :)"}
{"text":"FANATASTIC, INCREDIBLE, AMAZEBALLS, DELICIOUS! Had the ribs (tips to be exact), black beans and fried Yucca root. Wifey had the \"Reina Pepiada\" (Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro) sandwich. Can't wait to go back. Every thing was so tasty. Wanna try EVERYTHING! Ivan was so nice...gave us sampleS. Clean and customer friendly place. FYI--Fried Yucca root bests French Fries...sooo good"}
{"text":"I've never heard of an arepa before so I was glad this was my first experience of it. Food is soooooo fulfilling and delicious. You can honestly get full just off of one. Their side dishes there are also great too. We had empanadas, their pork rinds, and their drinks. Def coming back whenever I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Let me just start this review with the fact that I am OBSESSED with arepas.  I first tried this glorious gift to mankind in Providence, Rhode Island, of all places. It was the little mom and pop where the owners obviously just moved from Venezuela. Anyway, fast forward 3 years and I've tried to find arepas wherever I go. I've tried Caracas Arepa bar in NY and was not impressed. Closer to home, I've had Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills, which is okay and Cafe Bolivar in Santa Monica (which is really really good).   Now, for Viva Las Arepas. I saw it as I was driving to North Vegas and immediately pulled a U-turn to grab me some arepas. I ordered the pork arepa with cheese and it was really really good! Their guasacaca (green sauce) was really good.   On my last trip to Vegas I had to come back. They did a whole overhaul on this place. It looks much nicer than it used to. So I ordered the pork arepa again. This time, the sauce it came with was either the spicy sauce or some white \"cilantro\" sauce. It was not the same guasacaca I had become accustomed to. The spicy sauce was good, but I think that the white sauce was too creamy. Bring back your old sauce!!!!  Overall, it's still very good in terms of arepas. The meat is tender and well seasoned. The arepas are obviously freshly home made and they have a nice crust to them. I will have to come back on every pilgrimage to Vegas =)  Other things to note: There is a parking lot and outdoor seating. Prices are pretty good. One arepa will fill you up. I've also had the fried yucca and the plantains; both are good!"}
{"text":"If you want some really tasty food with great sauces and wood fired meats this is the place. The Arepas are excellent and everything using the corn flour is amazing. The cilantro sauce is good on everything and anything."}
{"text":"What an amazing little gem in Vegas!  We tried the top 3 arepas: Reina Pepiadas, garlic shrimp, and roast pork butt.  We were slightly hesistant about the Reina Pepiadas first because of the mayo, but the mayo actually added an extra dimention of richness to each bite.  Each arepa was bursting with flavor.  I would recommend asking for your arepas to be grilled slightly longer to give the outer shell an extra crispy texture.  We arrived at 11AM and by the time we were done with our food at 11:30AM, there was already a decent line forming.  Good food is worth the wait...and the price is great!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Why is there so much rave about this place? I stopped by here on the way home today and got myself a carne asada arepas. It tasted like the kind of food I'd get at a mexican food truck on the side of the road - delicious but the flavor is because of the fat and oil. I felt pretty gross about myself after eating my arepas. This isn't the type of food for me and I think I will pass on this from now until t = - infinity."}
{"text":"We ordered the Mesquite smoked chicken combo plate with sides of white rice and black beans.  We also ordered the smoked beef arepas.  The only thing that tasted exceptional was the chicken.  The chicken was seasoned and grilled perfectly, the smokey flavor really shined.  The sides of black beans and rice was just ok, we had better at many places.  The beef arepas was bad.  The beef was lacking in seasoning and smokey note.  The arepas itself was hard and chewy, too old maybe. Service at the walk up counter was friendly, helpful, and quick. We like to give another shot because the chicken was so good. We also like another shot at the arepas, maybe the pulled pork version."}
{"text":"I had my first arepa at Viva Las Arepas and was mighty impressed. I arrived around 10PM on a Saturday night with my brother-in-law and set my eyes on the vegetarian arepa ($5), although what I actually got was more of a Frankenstein creation. The man at the register (who I'm assuming to be the manager/owner) was super helpful in assisting me with my order.   CUSTOM AREPA ($6ish): My arepa had black beans, cheese, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, and plantains in it! I topped off each bite with a dash of the cilantro sauce or the spicy red sauce. The fried egg and plantains were the best part. The employee talked me getting into plantains, and I'm glad I decided to try it out in my arepa. It was delicious! I was skeptical that one arepa would fill me up, but by meal's end I was good to go. :) 5/5  For my second visit I got a black bean and cheese arepa, which definitely lacked the creative spark of my Frankenstein creation, but was still yummy nonetheless. My husband got the wood fire beef plate ($10.99) and was happy. The white rice on the side was AMAZING. Soft, buttery, and full of flavor. I'm getting this as my own side on the next visit.   I wish Viva Las Arepas was closer to the locals, but I hear they're opening a second location so there's hope!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #43"}
{"text":"Be aware : Credit card surcharge $0.50                    (Under $10)  One order of chicken arepa came out $7.02 including tax and credit card surcharge. It is not worth the price. The smoked chicken tasted good but the bread was hard. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Fried Pork Rinds & Yucca Root Fried Plantains Wood Fire Chicken Arepa with Tomato, Lettuce, Onions Roasted Pork Butt Arepa with Tomato and Cheese Guava and Cheese Pastelito  Set beside Art of Flavors, where another star-studded sampling had just concluded in the best 'ice cream sandwich' ever to cross my lips, it was with long-held interest and a touch of gluttony that I finally entered Viva Las Arepas; my \"some for now with the rest for later\" order rooted not only in convenience but also in hopes of avoiding a later trip from home for dinner.  Ever popular amongst locals and tourists alike with a menu focused on the Venezuelan flatbread sandwich alongside additional items both grilled and fried the time was just past two on my arrival to the deceptively large space and greeted by a short line with the dining room 2/3 full it would not be long before I found myself standing at the counter, a friendly middle-aged man expediting orders and assigning me number #36, my five boxed selections delivered to the table a mere fifteen minutes thereafter.   Clearly a restaurant vested in its core with a menu infrequent to change it was in a duo of 'sides' that my meal began and although bland plantains dripping with excess grease quickly proved inedible the unlikely star of the show would in fact be the wood-grilled pigskins, a crispy exterior overlying supple fat with intense brine offset by tender chunks of fried yucca.  Moving next to a pair of arepas it was with the wood grilled chicken that I started yet with flavors no better than the frozen stuff from Roots sold at Walmart I quickly moved to the pork-butt, the flavor almost indistinguishable from the bird as a trickle of oil ran down my hand into the napkin below.  At this point tossing what was left of each sandwich to instead sample the rinds and root with accompanying sauces it was finally with the $2 Pastelito that I finished and although tasty enough to stand on its own I couldn't help but think that for a buck per bite I'd have been better off staying next door with another scoop of gelato."}
{"text":"3.5, I rounded up. Pros: good street food, not great. The arepas themselves (essentially the buns for the Venezuelan sandwich) didn't have any seasoning. I get it, it's authentic. But we are in America, authentic don't mean anything any mo'. Like my excellent grammar, when cooking a particular ethnic Cusine take some liberties, like GW and his guerrilla tactics on the Potomac...improvise mo-fo.   Order the #7. It was a chicken with cilantro and avocado. And #1 - chicken...and there is a beef one in there as well. The yuca was lame, not enough breading (if you are going to fry yuca, the fry the yuca).  The kids loved the chicken and cheese empanadas. I like the story of the chef. Really busted his ass to get a place going. That makes me like the place more. I want him to be a success. The lady at the POS was very nice, but if she was Venezuelan, I'm from Alpha Centauri. More like Mexizuelan. Worth the trip...yes (but it is halfway down the list of places to go in downtown LV). So much good food here (love that grammar)."}
{"text":"My original review still stands! Except I was wrong about getting 2 arepas. 1 is enough! And my boyfriend finally agreed with me and loved the chicken one this time, and thought the pork was too salty. Oooh they've also raised prices since the last time I came, so there's that"}
{"text":"I've always driven by this place and wondered what it was. Location wise, it's actually quite bad. Why? Well, it it's right in the middle of going towards downtown or going towards the strip. If you have an agenda, you'll always pass by this place. I think it's taken me over 5 years to finally try here. So this time while in Vegas, as I always try a local joint when I'm in town, Viva Las Arepas it was!   There is parking in the strip mall here. Depending what time you come here, it can be packed or not. We came at 7pm when it was packed and left at 8pm when it was not. The signage for the menu can be daunting at first. But when you look closer, it's really the same thing in English and the same thing in Spanish. They're not quite mirror perfect, but trust me it's the same.   I was a little hungry the day I was here, with some 4 other friends. We ordered almost $90 worth of food and drinks. No, I'm not kidding.  We got to try a lot of different things from here. So here it goes:  Wood Fire Beef-cut in thick 1/2 inch strips. Flavorful, not tender,slightly on the salty side,  great with the mojo sauce. They do give you quite a bit. Think of beef jerky but just a tad softer.  The side of beans and white rice were ok, nothing to be excited about and the portions were really small.   Fried Plantains-I have to say, this was the BEST fried plantains I have tasted anywhere. I've been to a lot of places and this place does it slightly crispy on the outside, soft and not overly sweet once you bite into it. MUST order.  Fried Yucca-So these are cut in one inch strips and fried. I thought they would be as good as the plantains. NO, they're not ! They tasted strange. It had a weird aftertaste on some of them I had. I do question the freshness of the Yucca.   Mango drink-Tasted like a watered down version of a mango lassi. Honestly, skip it.   Arepas-Now the arepas itself, they were quite good. They were airy that I couldn't taste any of the cornmeal. As for the fillings, there are plenty of choices but ugh, the line cook here put way too much salt into the shredded beef one.   Most of us liked this place but personally it's not one of those places I'm dying to go back. Prices here aren't quite cheap for cheap eats. They do open until 12am so if you want something different, I would definitely come here. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for so long.  It's located north of the Vegas strip so it's a tad away from all the crowds.   I tried the pork butt arepa and chicharon & yuca frites.  I really liked the arepa.  It's different from anything I have tried before.  I enjoyed the food and I'd love to come back."}
{"text":"So delicious and the staff is friendly.  I had the reina pepiada... Chicken avocado mayo and cilantro....it was seriously the best thing I've eaten in a while.  And affordable!"}
{"text":"We took 4 teenagers/young adults with us to viva las arepas and watched the 4 of them go from apprehensive to appreciative of the many foods we tried off the menu. We tried so much! Fresh mango juice ,guava pastelitos, the mixed grill, cachapas con queso and arepas, yuca and plantain .... All absolutely delicious! You have simply got to try this place!"}
{"text":"I tried their roast pork butt arepas! It was a little dry for my taste, maybe I should add the avocado next time. I love the magic sauce and their service was great. Pretty attentive to their customers! Also tried the passion fruit juice, but it was sort of weird tasting, I will probably go with the guava next time if I ever go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten all types of food, all over the world and this place is great!  The service is awesome and they take pride in their food.   The arepas are out of this world.  I know the #7 is great!  The one with eggs, ham, tomatoes and onions is wonderful!  The #1 is great too.  So many great choices.  I had something with coconut and cheese in a fried like ravioli tepatilo maybe my God it was great!  YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!  The sauces they serve with their food are simply amazing.  The passion fruit juice is absolutely delicious.  I'll be back my next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"A different location but the same tasty and quality Venezuelan food.  A #9 & #5 are my recommendations.  Also the fruit juices are freaking awesome.  I love the passion fruit.  Definitely a staple when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I woke up this morning and all I could think of was AREPAS! I asked people where this place is at since all I know is that it's close to Olympic Garden. I used my GPS to help me find this place and brought me to Art of Flavors. Where is this place? Ah, it's right next door to Art of Flavors tucked in the corner.  After a yummy experience from an arepas foodtruck, we got garlic shrimp arepa, pork butt arepa with cheese, Reina Pepiada arepa, wood fire chicken arepa and fried plantains. They have more options here compared to the foodtruck which is not surprising. The prices are about the same. But the arepa itself is less toasted and is heavier than the foodtruck version. The cilantro sauce is equally as good, this place's spicy/red sauce is spicier. I had to try their guanabana juice to compare it to what I had when I was a kid.   Garlic Shrimp Arepa: No tomatoes or veggies, just straight up garlic shrimp. I liked this a lot especially with the cilantro sauce which elevates the garlic flavor of the shrimp.  5/5  Roasted Pork Butt: Comes with tomato slices. Add cheese. In case you didn't know, pork butt = pork shoulder and not the actual butt of a pig. Tasty pork. Both the spicy and cilantro sauce work well with this. 4/5  Reina Pepiada Arepa: Cold chicken with mayo, avocado and cilantro. Tastes just like the one from the arepas foodtruck. A much better version of a chicken salad. 5/5  Wood Fire Chicken Arepa: Really flavorful chicken with tomato, onions and lettuce. 4/5  Fried Plantains: I love this stuff. My mom would fry some plantains for me as a snack when I was a kid. So simple and easy to make yet it tastes so good. The natural sweetness of the plantains come out when you fry them in high temperatures. Eventhough they could have gotten rid of the excess oil, I still like these things. 5/5  Guanabana: AKA soursop juice and in Filipino, guyabano. This tastes like concentrate mixed with lots of sugar and water. I couldn't taste soursop. 3/5  After that meal, we headed next door for dessert. After dessert, I decided to come back here so I can try the chicharron with fried yucca. Shawn tapped out as I was enjoying chicharron and yucca. All he said to me was \"I can't believe how you're still eating.\"  Chicharron with Fried Yucca: The chicharron wasn't the same crispy fatty pork I was excpeting. The yucca was good with the cilantro sauce though. It was as if I was eating garlic fries. Yum! 4/5"}
{"text":"I got a grilled chicken arepa with avacado and cilantro. Staff was friendly, tables and dining area was clean and tidy and lots of tables to sit."}
{"text":"This is our  third time here.. Introduced to by great friends.. It's a must have when we come to Vegas.. If only we had one in LA! Great fresh made to order Arepas! Staff is friendly and place is super clean. You can see all the action in the kitchen as well!"}
{"text":"Great find! Had the beef arepa, was pretty good, I also had the chicken salad one, wasn't great.. but what I really loved was there grilled chicken with rice and beans.. delicious!! I have to try the empanada next time, they looked great!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday around 1:30 pm. I ordered the beef arepa and chicken empanada and waited 35 minutes for my food! Mind you there was no line!! They forgot to make my food!! I came to this place when they were just a little shack sitting on the corner about a year or so ago and absolutely loved the prices and food, so I figured I'd go there again for cheap eats and great customer service.. NOPE!!! On top of it all the prices have risen!! I guess they moved into a building and decided to raise the prices with the move.. I won't be going back here.. OH.. The food wasn't all that either!! I'm too done trying to find a good place to eat in vegas"}
{"text":"Incredible!! We stumbled on this gem our first night here and are so glad we did. We tried a few different things, and all was great. I'd highly recommend you add this to your list during  your visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food! As a venezuelan, totally recommend this place. The arepas are on the small side, but the fillings are delicious. Last time I went they even had papelón con limón (my favorite from when I was a kid). I can't ever miss this spot every time I go to Vegas now. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Never had an Arepa before and now i'm not sure if i can live without them! This place should be all over. Great spot, excellent management, super clean, stellar food quality and consistency. On my recommend list for anyone visiting Vegas... even picky eaters and those with non ethnic pallets. A++"}
{"text":"After trying I love tapas, I figured out it was arepas. I had the shredded beef. The chicken and pork butt. Muy delicioso. I thought they were tiny hence why I ordered 3. Coming from a Guy who can eat it was hard to nom nom nom down the 3rd one. The meat was fresh with the right amount of seasoning. The corn bread thing it was in was lite and airy. I love the green mild sauce he gives on the side.  So good."}
{"text":"I was staying off the strip and walked almost two miles to this place after reading the reviews.  It was worth it.  I got the fried plantains and an arepa with pork.  Plantains are never bad.  The arepa was a little bland until I added one of the sauces, and then it was really good.  And filling.  After I left, I wished I had gotten another one for later."}
{"text":"This place was pretty fantastic.  The portions are massive and the food is delicious.  I'm a big fan.  It's definitely worth the trek if you're staying on the strip."}
{"text":"This is an office favorite, talk about packing a variety of flavors into a small flaky wonderful pocket of deliciousness. I come here often and it is a place where I order for a quick pick up and a quick cheat day lunch.  I typically order the one that has plantings beef in it- the everything Arepa.  Their service is great, this place is very clean, and it's always packed with happy patrons.  The tasty pockets called \"arepas\" remind me of the Mexican similarity to this called \"sope\".  Divine."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood to try something new, do yourself a favor and stop by I Love Arepas! This place has incredibly tasty Venezuelan food and refreshing drinks. My FAVORITE is the pork butt (Pernil) arepa and the sugar cane with lemon juice, or the pastelitos (meat pies) with passion fruit juice.   DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. Clean location and very courteous customer service. It's near the downtown area so it's easy to get to. Once you enter the location you walk up to the counter and order. All items are also translated in English."}
{"text":"This place rules. If you're staying at the Stratosphere, doubt be alarmed by the slightly sketchy two block walk to get there, it's totally worth it. My go-to order is the chicken thighs ($6.50 w/ rice and beans). Delicious wood-grilled chicken you can eat off the bone, just like ribs. The beans are even better... maybe the best thing they serve. The arepas are also amazing, as you'd expect, and the corn and cheese pancake thing... I have no words. Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is like heaven! It's too good to be true! So so so good! This people are the real deal. Authentic, fresh and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is great value. The food was awesome and the price was even better. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"**Summary**        - Taste - Maybe it was an off day, but I just didn't like the flavor of arepas. The mix grill wasn't bad though. If I were to come back, I'd get the Pork Spare Rib meal. That was my favorite.        - Value - I think the price is a little high for what you're getting **Ordered**        - $22.99 Wood Fire Mix Grill w/ Fried Plantain & Fried Yucca Root - The pork spare ribs were delicous. Tender & tasty. The Beef was ok. However, the chicken was dry and the sausage wasn't very tasty.        - $4.50 Wood Fire Chicken Arepas - The chicken was dry. The arepas seemed to be more bun then anything else.        - $5.50 Wood Fire Beef Arepas - Bun, oil, and salty beef. Didn't really like the taste. **Recommendations**        - I'd wouldn't really recommend this place. There's a lot of other places you could get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!   We will be back. We had a little bit of everything and thoroughly enjoyed it all!    We got a three arepas (wood fired beef, wood fired chicken and roasted pork butt). All were delicious but I enjoyed the chicken the most. They serve everything with a mayo, cilantro, parsley sauce. It is amazing! The black beans are very flavorful I wish I could have fit them on my arepa."}
{"text":"Checked this place out today, while it was 110+ degrees out, and they had no A/C running! If they did, you definitely could not feel it because it was just as warm inside as it was outside.   On to the food - we ordered the #1 carne asada, #2 wood fired chicken, and #4 pork butt arepas. When you get your food, they provide 2 sauces - a creamy, cilantro-ish (similar to the creamy cilantro dressing from El Pollo Loco) and a salsa verde that has a little bit of a spicy kick to it. Both sauces had great flavor, and thank goodness they did because you'll need it. I've never had arepas before so I'm not sure if they're meant to be bland so it'll pick up flavors from the meat, but they were just that. Unfortunately, the meats didn't really help either because they were pretty flavorless, too. The carne asada arepa was so dry that I had to douse it in the green sauces just to get through it and still didn't finish it. The pork butt had some type of sweet tomato based sauce on it, sort of tasted like al pastor. It was just ok, definitely not as dry as the asada. I didn't try the chicken arepa but my BF said it was just ok.   We also ordered the 3 chicken thighs special that's posted on the window by the register and an order of yucca fries. I love yucca fries and these were just right. Crunchy on the outside, smooth inside. The chicken thighs special came with 3 pieces of grilled boneless, skinless thighs, black beans, and rice. I would come back here just for the beans and rice! Whatever flavor was lacking in the arepas was totally made up for in the rice and beans. Definitely worth a try.   Overall, I'm not completely in love with the place but they have a lot of other items on the menu that seemed interesting. Might give it another shot some day."}
{"text":"We went to Viva Las Arepas to try out Venenzuelan food. Since this restaurant has great reviews on yelp, we decided to give it a try.   The restaurant is very clean and welcoming. The person at the counter greeted us as we entered and also in our mother tongue as well :). We wanted to try out Arepas (vegetarian) and cachapas, so we ordered these.  The order was ready very quickly. The waiter was extremely polite. The Arepas were good. We specially loved the cachapas, which reminded us of an Indian corn bread dish. It was not too sweet but just enough sweet. We all shared it and enjoyed every bit of this dish. Highly recommend you to try it.  Overall great food and service. I will return here on my next visit on Vegas."}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to expect. Since I never had arrepas before. Surprisingly the arrepas were good, I ordered a wood fire beef with avocado it was packed with lightly seasoned beef and priced very well for only $5. I also ordered a 1/4 fired wood chicken with a side. The fire cooked chicken was ok, it lacked flavor unless you douse it with one of the chili sauce they give you.   When your in line you better know what you want since the line moves fast and people will be standing behind you. I definitely want to go back again to try some of the other arrepas.   Only drawback it's free refills on fountain drinks but you have to ask the counter person to get a refill since it's behind the counter. Plenty of tables inside to eat.   Parking is a hit and miss since it's a small plaza with limited amount of parking."}
{"text":"I do love these mini grilled pocket sandwiches. All are priced around $3.50-$4.00 and are jammed pack with great ingredients. Located right outside of Dino's, they are a must before, or after getting a little tipsy.  I had originally wanted to get the tongue, but they ran out. Instead, the chef suggested the leg meat and I have to bow down to the tender and flavorful meat. Cut off in thick gyro like pieces, this could be deadly. The rest of the group ordered and we had this meal family style. The garlic shrimp were tender and juicy. There is nothing worst than ordering shrimp and getting rubber instead. So good we order three. The pork butt was also delicious. The pulled chicken, mayo, and avocado arepa was so rich and decadent. The combination was perfection, but not for more than a few bites. I was glad to be able to pass it on after a bite. We had also ordered the cod and that was not a hit. For being a mild fish, it had an overbearing flavor. It was extremely salty and was the last to be finished."}
{"text":"first venezuelan food and it was really good! it was our first time so we asked for popular dish and he said it was #1 & #7 arepas. they were both good! :) chicken dish had too much mayo but still pretty tasty. price was pretty reasonable for the taste! :)"}
{"text":"I've never had an Arepa before but heard lots of good things about this place so we had to try it! After scanning reviews and the menu we settled on the Garlic Shrimp (hot), Wood Fired Beef, and a couple of Tequenos (fried cheese sticks). I feel the food was pricey for the quantity. I liked the cheese sticks, but Doug thought they tasted too sweet. The Garlic Shrimp was ok (Like shrimp scampi on a maize bun) the shrimp was a little mushy and after a few bites was over it. The beef was ok too, just not a lot of flavor even with the sauces. I guess we just don't get the appeal. The service was good but... I would not go back. I rather save room for gelato."}
{"text":"This was great! Recommended by friends, small corner restaurant but very clean very friendly staff and delicious arepas. They gave arepas a great twist. I had the reina pepiada arepa, which is stuffed with pulled chicken in a creamy sauce of avocado, mayo & cilantro. Add a bit of their homemade hot salsa - just great! Also had agua de Panela with lime, refreshing! Definitely a stop to make on all my future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"It just doesn't get any better than this.  I had an empanada, arepa, and plantains.  For the price, you simply can't have a tastier meal than Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"Unless you live in a Venezuelan home, arepas are difficult to find. A menos que usted vive en un hogar venezolana , arepas son difíciles de encontrar. Viva Viva Lase Arepas!!  Muy, muy autentico!!"}
{"text":"Second review for this place and once again an outstanding meal, I had the Pabellon this time, a little taste of home that always brings back great memories of living in Venezuela, I also had an arepa and Yuca fries, my wife thoroughly enjoyed the garlic shrimp arepa and washed it all down with agua de papelon, I will continue to support this establishment."}
{"text":"Blame it on the A-a-a-a-a-alcohol if you want, but the food this place puts out was like mana from heaven at midnight last Saturday night. We were leaving Dino's and a friend suggested we get Arepas, since I'd never tried them before. We got a beef arepa and a lingua arepa. When i tasted the yummy, cheesy, tender filling surrounded by the moist corn flour wrap I could barely put it down. I love that they leave the sauce on the side, so you can add it to your liking. The shredded beef was so tender and hearty. The lingua (beef tongue) tasted very similar to a slow cooked pot roast that had been shredded and sauteed with peppers and onions. It was spicy and the accompanying sauce made it even more so. It was delicious! It took some liquid courage to get me to try it, but now I'm hooked! I'm actually considering driving there on my lunch hour today (completely sober of course)! This place is a must try if you've never had an Arepa, or if you're close to downtown and hungry!"}
{"text":"Best Latin American food in Vegas IMHO. I don't know what they put in that green sauce but I could drink it straight and die happy."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant, they have tasty, and fresh authentic Venezuelan food. very clean restaurant. Food cooked on real wood fire.  Beef Arepas woodfire cooked were amazing went well with fresh fruit juice. Moderately priced, fast and friendly service. The restaurant located in Las Vegas Blvd and Oakey. They have decent parking. If you are downtown I suggest you give this place a try."}
{"text":"soooooooo......i came here with high hopes because of the ratings....i have had better arepas in NYC. i ordered the chicken avocado, the black bean vegetarian, and the pernil (pork butt), also ordered the white rice and beans mix....the ONLY thing that made me happy was the pernil arepa..... and it was the filling that was good .. the actual arepa was bland, stiff, and not impressive at all. but the customer service was good and the restaurant was clean. if you want  a quick meal that's descent ...this is the place."}
{"text":"A true hole in the wall off the strip that, according to the V-born hubster, is fine authentic Venezuelan fare; and cheap too.  Lots of arepas and even soda and drinks from abroad.   Everything is tasty from cachapa, sweet corn tortilla with white cheese, a reina pepiada, the tequeno, the empanadas, ERRYTHANG!  Fantastic find; patting myself on the back."}
{"text":"Amazing! The pabellon plate was delicious. The beef is so flavorful. The black beans are so creamy, and the plantains are the perfect level of sweet. The wood fired chicken arepa  was equally delicious. These delights were quickly devoured by my family and myself. The owner even came by to great us and brought my son some fries. What awesome service. This will be my go to spot when I'm downtown or heading near the strip. Viva Las Arepas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the vegetarian and reina pepiada arepa.  Both were delicious.  Just the right size and priced right.  Staff was friendly and the place was very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Wow! So good, and my wish is to have this place in LA near me so that I could eat there everyday.   We shared the beef and pork arepas and the beef and beans/cheese fried empanadas.  Everything was delicious, especially with the crack sauce.  Don't forget to pick up a bottle of the hot crack sauce and the cilantro crack sauce at the counter since they don't stock them at each table.    I also got coffee, which was hot and strong.  It comes with a vanilla creamer and sugar.  Read the English menu board, which is the one on the left, if you no comprende Espanol.   Arepas - the name sounds bad, but arepas are muy bueno."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place, you have no taste buds!!!! AMAZINGGGG"}
{"text":"Clásico de la comida Venezolana, me la ha recomendado un amigo, es amante de las arepas, y por cierto, este lugar es genial. Muy recomendable."}
{"text":"Quite easily one of the most unexpectedly unique and savory dining experiences.  Try the 4 and the 7, though the shredded beef was also amazing.  We are definitely returning to sample some more!  Also, the service was great."}
{"text":"These are the best arepas in America. I always come here when I'm in Vegas and I recommend it to all of my friends. I get the #2 chicken arepa and it is always better than the last somehow...Five stars, this place is a MUST when in Vegas! If food were God then these arepas are what God would be."}
{"text":"We're not close to this locale, but if we're in the neighborhood, it's a refreshing change of pace for lunch!!  Not your typical sandwich.  Arepas are all amazing.  Try the #12 for sure - beef, beans, plantains & cheese.  It's the bomb.  Or order without plantains!!  Next time we're trying the ham & cheese & the shrimp.  The bean & cheese empanada was great as well as the cheese rollup stick thing.  Service was very friendly & food came out fast.  Both the sauces they delivered to the table were keepers.  Wanted to put one in my purse.  Hah  All the meats are very well cooked.  If you want tender shredded anything, this is your place.  We're fans & going back."}
{"text":"Let's just talk about the sides: the fried plantains are the best I've ever had; the fried yucca is ridiculous; and their black beans taste like chili."}
{"text":"This a food fast vs. fast food establishment. It has a great menu of foods and was fun trying out what was recommended to me. This is Latin American food, more Caribbean based than say Mexican. I had a Gordita like stuffed empanada that had carne asada, plantains, cheese and a really flavorful couple of sauces delivered with the food. Theyre very friendly, not a first date place unless you are super casual. They have Agua Frescas, pineapple, mango and a couple of others, also very good. I gave it a 5/5 because it different, foods fresh and should be visited by all"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!  It is located in such a unique building with many eating options, but this is by far my favorite!  The arepas are moist, stuffed with such yummy things.  My favorite has plantains and white cheese and just melts in your mouth!!  It is a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"All the menu items I got were delicious. Must try the chachapa dish it's generously filled with cheese and wrapped in a sweeter version of the arepa. The carne asada plate was awesome and seasoned perfectly with just simple salt and pepper and it was tender so no need for a knife. Just stay away from the side of salad. My go to is the Reina pepiada which is kinda like a better version of a chicken salad. Knocked off one star because the staff were kinda disorganized and unprofessional with the manager yelling at his staff. I've also been to the rainbow location which I prefer."}
{"text":"Everything here is awesome. My favorites would have to be the chachapa and the ham and cheese arepa. The chachapa is filled with so much gooey melts cheese and wrapped like a quesadilla with a sweeter thinner version of the arepa. The ham and cheese arepa is so simple but filled with so many flavors. It's overloaded with cheese and the ham is thick cut and layered just right in the arepa. Those two are a must try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've heard about Arepas before trying this place but this was my first time actually trying it. I was a total newbie but the lady was nice and recommended the #12 - Arepa Pabellon which is beef black beans plantain and cheese. Wow! It was soo good. Very filling. I've tried some other places in other city's since and idkif its just me but they were not as good.   I'm hungry now, think I'll head over!"}
{"text":"For about 5 years, I'd driven by this place and thought \"Hey, I should try that someday.\"  Someday finally came, and I'm very happy I finally hit the exact right combination of hunger and proximity so I could try it out.   I'd never had an Arepa before, and didn't really know what to expect. I don't actually know how to describe it either.  Like a sandwich but not on bread, and I chose to stuff mine with some delicious shredded beef.  They were very inexpensive, but also surprisingly filling, so I will have to go back and try different ones next time out.    Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Totally starving after the opening night of the PollyGrind film festival and first Friday party down near that art district.  The gang of us wandered down the street and came upon I Love Arepas, and proceed to chow down on some fabulous black bean and cheese arepas, as well as camaron arepas!  So yummy, and we weren't even drunk!  Well, I wasn't.  Also good were the fried cheese bread sticks, and the meat lovers like the pork, beef, chicken arepas, too!  I hope to find this kind of dish back in Sacramento when I return!"}
{"text":"Forgot about this place for a while until a visiting friend requested that we visit. So we did. The house specialty here are deceptively hearty sandwiches served in soft, creamy arepas - which are sort of like the love child of cornbread and bao. The meats grilled over wood - stacks of which are piled inside the restaurant - are imparted with a smoky flavor that perfectly complements the buns into which the meat is nestled. Be aware that these are pretty filling - the first time I was here I ordered two, with a side of rice and beans, and it was way too much food. These things are filling."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the ribs, arepas with shredded chicken and cilantro sauce. Black beans and fried yucca. Everything was so delicious.  A great addition to the neighborhood. Will be back."}
{"text":"A place you must try in Las Vegas!! I went for the first time and it was amazing. I ordered the arepa con queso and it was so good. Reminded me of the arepas I've had in Colombia."}
{"text":"The food was not bad. I didn't like the bread that much though. I did like the pork butt sandwich the most, other ones i tried were just OK. I did expect something out of the ordinary but nothing like that here would prefer a carne asada sandwich instead of this any day."}
{"text":"I went here while I was passing through Vegas on my way home. I came here hungry and left with a belly full of deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"We came here with a bunch of Yelpers after the CMYE Baseball and Beers event.  I wasn't hungry but I just HAD to try this place after so many glowing reviews.  I got the pork butt and my wife ordered the shredded beef.  Both were really tasty and I can't wait to come back here with a complete appetite to try some other arepas.  Watching the staff of 2 do their magic while we were eating was pretty cool.  I have jury duty in a couple of weeks so I'm already planning on trying the tongue, shrimp and maaaaaaybe the tripe."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came at a slow time and spoke to the chef,  I speak Spanish and he has a very cute Venezuelan accent, anyway, the food was grilled perfectly and the flavors were unique and different. Love the natural fruit drinks.  The place is decorated in my favorite color: yellow. The place is clean, the portions are nice, and the service is friendly. Chef even sent us chicharron and yuca frita, never had it before but loved it. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great delicious food, lovely staff and cozy spot. Pop by if you're nearby, you won't regret."}
{"text":"Si,si,si! Yes,yes,yes! Ay que bueno! Everything is good! Viva!!!"}
{"text":"The best and most creative arepas I've ever had. Take it from a Colombian. Very delicious. Definitely would come back. price very convenient. Service, excellent."}
{"text":"This place is definitely in the sketchy part of town.  We had found this place on Yelp with great reviews and and decided to have a friend drive us out here.  It's truest a hole in the wall.   Our cashier Felix was helpful.  It was our first time eating arepas.  I'm not sure how Arepas should be but I can give my honest opinion on what I know.  I love the fact that the arepas are home made.  We ordered #9 Vegetarian, #12 Pabellon Arepa, #1 Asada Arepa, #7 Reina Pepiada and some deserts.    I really liked the arepas but there was sooooo much sauces in it.  The meats were practically soaked in sauces.  I would have liked to be able to get the meat for its flavor and not just drenched in sauces.    I did however, enjoy the #13 Cachapas.  It was sweet arepas with cheese.  It was delicious! I would totally order this item again as a snack!"}
{"text":"The beef was the best in my opinion. What sells is the bread . The chicken arepa with the avocado was okay. If I'm in the area, yes I'll stop by and try it again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and it's pretty good. The first time I had the chicken arepa and this time I had the black bean and cheese arepa. You would think these small arepas wouldn't be enough but I can't even finish one because it's so much and so rich. Their fries are always on point and the food is pretty cheap. This place is definitely a gem on the strip but they do close at midnight which is kind of a bummer. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The staff was not helpful and the food was awful. The first time in a while that I have actually thrown away my meal after only eating a bite or two."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Had the chicken breast arepa with mayo and cilantro, cheese stick and fries. All very good. Decent price and the service was outstanding. The guy at the counter was super friendly and poked fun at my wife for her attempts at spanish and when I got up to throw away my trash someone was there at the table to do it.   We will definitely be back to try other arepas."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in search of eating something new and interesting that we can't find back home, so we ended up at Viva Las Arepas. We ordered a Reina Pepiada, carne asada arepa, plantains, side salad, mango juiceI and parchita. I'm not exagerrating when I say that all of the food was delicious and beyond our expectations! The Reina Pepiada was creamy and tangy as well as the salad.  The plantains were hot, crispy, and perfectly sweet.  And if you have to choose what to drink I highly suggest parchita, especially if you like tangy refreshing drinks.   On top of serving fabulous food,  the cashier was very helpful, attentive, and let us try their specialty drinks.  He even went out of his way to bring our food out to our table. The price of the food was very reasonable ($26 for all of the food mentioned above). This is great if you're in Vegas and trying to stay within budget because we all know how expensive Vegas can be.  Ultimately, the food and service were deserving of the 5 stars.  We will definitely be back before the weekend is over!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I had good Venezuelan food. Very authentic food and the atmosphere, while very simple, reminds one of what you would experience in Venezuela. This is not a fancy restaurant but if you want some great authentic venezuelan food, you should give it a try. !Bien sabroso! --Terrible(Terry)"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of Yelp Talkers, I went here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  (NOTE TO YELP, please fix the address.)   I ordered some arepas, empanadas, and other goodies to sample with the office and took them back with me.  I loved the coating on the techenos (cheese sticks) and the empanadas.  The Arepas were overstuffed and packed with flavor.  Not a complaint but be aware the Arepas (corn pita) sometimes breaks apart and crumbles so dont try to eat in your car or on the run unless you are wearing something that can get dirty.  Also be aware that the menu on the website is not the same as when you get there so don't plan your order by number and call it in.  Mysty is right, the mango drink is superb and not to sweet.  The staff is friendly and Felix talks to everyone.  When it is busy, it isn't fast so be aware. It took me about 20 minutes to get my order.  I love me some Arepas"}
{"text":"My heart sank down as it dawned on me that you are 6 hours away.. I miss you. You fry your plantains to perfection and I want more. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Your Reina Pepiada (chicken/mayo/avocado/and that cilantro dressing - add their house-made salsa on top) was heartwarming. The vegetarian arepa was just as delicious.. I freakin' ate it for breakfast with your house made cappuccino for Pete's sake. Even the bean and cheese empanada was amazing!   Okay, seriously though - from chatting with the guys that worked the late shift on Saturday I found out that this was a small food truck that proved its cute self to be delicious. Since it was that fantastic they were able to move into a place at the end of a little strip mall on the old Las Vegas strip... What more do you need? I will be back for you Viva Las Arepas, don't miss your Utahn fan too much ;)"}
{"text":"The Arepas here are to die for. I've tried 3 different ones so far and all have been excellent. The mango juice is good too! If you are in Vegas and don't stop here for at least one meal, you are truly missing out."}
{"text":"i want to make sweet love to the cachapa con queso...  i want to lay on a bed between an arepa and a cachapa..."}
{"text":"The cachapas were delicious. Great taste and the cheesse was really good. The Reina Pepiada was not my favorite because the chicken was grilled and tasted too much like grilled chicken and not like Reina Pepiada."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Venezuelan food and my was it delicious! The service was great as the friendly guy behind the counter patiently explained the menu and its items to us. He mentioned that all the meat is wood fired so the meat has a mesquite tast to it. Arepa is a ground maize flatbread sandwich. I saw it as a tamale sandwich. My bf and I had the Reina Peplada #7 which consists of chicken breast, avocado, and cilantro. I added some of the creamy cilantro sauce and it was definitely a party in my mouth. It's a cold sandwich so it tasted great while we waited for my hot arepas to cool down. I ordered the Perico #11 which has scrambled eggs, tomato, onion, and ham.. cuz breakfast is good any time of the day!  We also tried the shredded beef empanada and coconut and cheese pastelito. The pastelito was pretty sweet and it was a lot better than I expected. We were pretty full after sharing these four items. I also had a mango juice to help wash down all the delicious goodness. A good part of all this food is that it's gluten free, fresh, and handmade to order.   The next time I decide to shop at the North Outlets I'm definitely going to come back here for more arepas!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely fantastic place.  Yelp reviewers were correct.  This is a 4 1/2 rated place.    The meats are just perfect.  And the pastelitos are the best.    We will eat here again.   The prices were fantastic for Vegas!!!  It's at the south end of the shopping center.  Past it many times on other trips.  My mistake!!!"}
{"text":"Passed this place several times in the strip area. Though I found it very interest for a Venezuelan food place. In my option this place is really tasty just wasn't feeling it too much. I give this place 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped by one lazy Sunday night, our last night in town.  We were both still full from a late lunch so we ended up only ordering 1 arepas, the flame grilled beef, and a cachapas.    We took it back to our hotel room and chowed down.  The cachapas definitely would have been a lot better hot.  But then again...it was only a 10 minute drive back to our hotel - how quickly should I have to eat this thing to capitalize on maximum deliciousness?  I love how corn-y it tasted but with the hardened cheese in between, it became somewhat less palatable.  Also, it's sweet so prepare your mouth for that taste profile.  Hubby ordered the flame grilled beef arepa.  On first bite, I wasn't convinced it was better than our usual spot out here.  But when he gave up on it, I took the 1/3 he had left and nibbled.  I have to say the sauces and veggies inside were surprisingly good.  The arepas are definitely a good size and one will probably fill you up pretty well.  I'm glad we got to try it, at least.  The guy who took our order was very nice and gave us the delicious sauces which tasted better with the arepa than the cachapa."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for the first time. The food was really authentic and delicious. The prices were reasonably low; and the place and bathroom were clean. The only downfall is the area in which it is located due to safety concerns. But overall, I will return for the food."}
{"text":"Last night, my hubby, 14 month old and some friends decided to try this place because we'd driven by it before. I'm glad to say the Arepas were amazing!!! Number 12 was fantastic! The guava and cheese pastelito was delicious! The mango drink was sooooooooooooo good! Number 13 was also amazing! We all were completely satisfied with our meal, including my 14 month old baby that ate a bit of everything! We'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"So freakin good and delicious. I really like the sweet #13 and the #4 and #7 are my go to meat choices. The service is fast and friendly, and eating here will totally make your day. The taste is super authentic, and one of the big reasons I love this place so much is the amazing sugarcane juice and the plantains for dessert."}
{"text":"The arepas are great! Mango fruit drink quenched my thirst. And wasn't too sweet. I tried the pabellon and reina pepiada arepa. Very tasty and filling! Was a small walk from my hotel-SLS. Would definitely recommend to visitors."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices, very clean inside. The empenadas are the best!!! The arepas are super good too!"}
{"text":"Blegh. My pork arepa was drenched in oil. That usually wouldn't turn me off, but the arepa was completely flavorless. I had to drown it in \"spicy\" salsa that was more mild than vanilla pudding. Never again."}
{"text":"Never had a arepa before until I tried this place..  And they are so good!!  To someone that doesn't know arepas imagine the masa for a sope/ pupusa and slice in half and stuffed with goodness.  And those yuca fries with fried pork!!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had a pupusa, a tamale, and tacos while in Vegas - - but the absolute joy was the #12 Pabellón Arepa here,  with beef, black beans, plantains & cheese.  $7 seems a lot for what is hardly more than a handful, but what makes it great, and still a real value,  is how concentrated, rich, and satisfying that handful is.    The arepa crust has a perfect crunch and rich corn flavor - - but it is not a starch bomb - - it is a svelte, light, super tasty vehicle for some outrageous goodness inside.  The full, complex, combination of earthy beans, toothy shredded beef, and a touch of sweet plaintain, accented by the crumbly cheese is massively satisfying.   Fantastic balance of flavors, textures, and fine, fine ingredients, deftly assembled.  Most 'sandwich' places give you a big glob of starch with some scant tasty ingredients buried within;  some taco places actually give you precious little food;  but this arepa is a full-on powerhouse of ingredient excellence, in a light and delicious frame."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Finally a food stand I can get behind!  This place is the real deal.  They cook the masa batter on a little flat top to order and fill 'em with your choice of meats and stuff.    Screw all of those hipster food trucks that are more about the twitter feed and the graphics on the truck than the food (yeah, you, sloppi jo's.  greasy, runny pork with no depth of flavor with an egg on top and an untoasted, stale, store-bought tortilla on the side?  no thank you).  Hey look at us!  We're a bunch of goofy 20 year olds who know nothing about food but check out our cool truck and tattoos and goofy dances and overpriced junkfood served in a parking lot!  To me the idea behind a truck is good, cheap food that's convenient.  If you have to DRIVE to the truck, then what's the point.  The truck should be where you are.  YOU shouldn't have to go to IT.    But I digress...  The masa pancake bread thing is crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  They split em and fill em with any of a dozen or so goodies, including tongue and tripe.  The fillings were yummy without exception.  I got a bean and cheese, a pork, and a beef.  All were delish.  Served with a chili sour cream sauce and a pureed hot sauce.  Also tried an empanada as well.  It was odd but good.  Very little filling in the deep-fried empanada and the masa shell blew up like a balloon from the steam created inside while in the fryer which actually made for a pillow-like chickeny pocket of love.  Bonus points for its location out front of Dino's, a great dive bar on LV Blvd.  Conveniently located right underneath a billboard for a bailbondsman, across the street from the OG.  Hit it."}
{"text":"I hate to drop my rating, but I seriously believe that once Viva Las Arepas moved to their permanent location, they should have had another listing put up. Why? They don't offer the same items!  I was talking to my sister about this, a place hooks you on certain items for a great price, blows up in popularity and then and goes and changes everything that made you love them in the first place, while upping the price.  I've been eating here for 3 years. I'm the one who gave the business owner a \"You've been Yelped card\" to claim their business page and I think they make a good product. What I hate is that they don't offer lengua or tripe anymore. Those two items are the only reason I ate here and it's the only reason I keep coming back - on the maybe misguided hope that they've brought those two dishes back.  Alas, I've been relegated to chicken or beef, which I'm none too impressed with. I can get chicken and beef anywhere. I can make them at home (which I've done - if you buy Maseca, you can make arepas.) Lengua and tripe aren't things I know how to cook for 1 person.   I've had their other dishes which are okay, and they have really great sauces, but I don't feel the need to keep coming back as they don't offer what I like anymore."}
{"text":"This is a yummy food stand  i had a shrimp and a chicken arepa and bf had pork and a beef one. It is basically a fried corn cake with the filling of your choice, yum the salsa is spicy the shrimp was done well and the chicken is juicy. The black bean empinada was dry and tasteless and kinda soggy. The shrimp arepa was supposed be cold but the one i had was warm and i don't think i would want it cold. It was 22$ for 4 Arepas and an empinada and Two drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food here! We had the wood fire beef arepa and chicken empanada. I ordered a wood fire grill plate with a side of salad and plantains. SO DELICIOUS. We came for lunch and will probably be back for dinner!! Passion fruit agua fresca was also yummy!"}
{"text":"1 - 5 scale Food 4 Service 4  Location 3 but clean and friendly  Get the wings! The ham an cheese was really good and the fries were huge.   I can't wait to try the roasted chicken after I noticed wood for the oven they have hidden in the back.   This is a great place if you need to experience new flavors and take in a little culture."}
{"text":"I have no idea why, but lately I've been obsessed with arepas. If I see it on a menu, I'm going to try it out. So when this place popped up on Yelp while we were in Vegas, I knew we were gonna make a stop here, even if it meant venturing off the strip!  Located downtown, we stopped by on our way home from Vegas, around noon on a Sunday. Just a small place, but when we got there, line was to the door.  I had planned to try a couple arepas thinking they would be small enough for me to try more than one. But their arepas are a decent size. So I got one and tried the Reina Pepiada - chicken mixed with mayo, avocado, and cilantro - their take on chicken salad I would think. It was good but after awhile, the mayo just overpowered the arepa. It seemed like there was too much filling for the arepa - which some will say is a good thing. But I really liked the arepa - crunchy crust on the outside, fluffy on the inside. So it would've been nice to have a balance of filling and arepa with every bite.   Got an order of plantains which was really good. Tried the beef and chicken empanadas, but I was not a fan.   Still... I can't wait to go back to Vegas and stop by to try a different arepa... or two!"}
{"text":"Cost: $11  Finally decided to give the most reviewed place on Yelp in the neighbourhood a try.  Wasn't disappointed.  The Arepa was delicious (but only after adding the spicy sauce).  The empanada was a bit too thickly coated in flour for my taste, so I'd say it was okay.   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Love the arepas, only wish their sides were better. Rice and beans are a bit bland."}
{"text":"Great value for money and service. All their arepas are good but need a generous dashing off their house sauces to bring the flavors out. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"¡Conchale vale! Tony y Pedro se sobraron con la comida y el servicio. Los tequeños son para chuparse los dedos. Vengo de Los Ángeles y son lo mejor. Recomendado"}
{"text":"I've been there last week for the first time, I came just because they have nice reviews and I wanted to try something different. Unfortunately I didn't like it, it doesn't speak to my taste buds. Also, it was very annoying to order because the guy at the cashier wasn't speaking English, so it was hard to explain what I want. Anyway, for me, I wouldn't go there again but I can see other people like this place and I understand not everyone has the same taste, so if you're not sure, go there an try for yourself."}
{"text":"It's good...for what it is. I had the number 1, the number 7 and the Hallacas, (spelling)? The Hallacas (sp) was delicious, I'm not a fan of raisins and olives so that was my only complaint about it and that it came pre-made so I couldn't get them removed. However, despite my distaste for raisins and olives, it still came out pretty good. The breading they used for the Arepas though was outstanding, I actually could not get enough of that which is why I loved the #1 but also the #7. The #7 was a little more creamier than I thought but the breading had me finish the whole thing. The only real negative about the place as other people have mentioned is that if you go during the summer be prepared to sweat while you eat or at least wait for your food to be finished. However, it's a trade off since melting like Frosty the Snowman will always be tolerable if I can watch a priest, stripper, crackhead, retirees, and a man dressed as Catwoman walk by. (Yes, I typed that correctly, a man dressed as Catwoman, entertaining to say the least) This corner never fails to disappoint."}
{"text":"The arepas here are the best. Try the beef with plantains, chicken with guacamole or pork with cheese.  The corn meal bread is delicious.  This place has a full menu and the chicken and beef dishes are all good.  Fantastic empanadas!   If you're going to the OG have some of this Venezuelan food to soak up the beer.  Nice alternative to Boston Pizza in this neighborhood.  And if you park in the parking lot on the Strip nearby it's safe at night."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. My husband got the pork butt arepa and I got the pabellon and they were delicious. I can't wait to go again when we visit Vegas :)"}
{"text":"I was trying to think of a dumb arepa joke and didn't have much success.   Knock, knock.  Who's there? Arepa.  Arepa who?  Arepa any man who brings me delicious venezuelan sammiches.  Womp womp womp.   I told you it was going to be dumb.   Went on Saturday 11-7-15 around 8pm to grab a quick bite.  $10.57 got me a chicken arepa with black beans and a beef empanada.  This is actually my second time here and I really like arepas.  Being from the south and eating lots of hominy and grits, an arepa is kind of like if you made a hamburger bun out of really thick, fine-ground grits and then stuffed it with lettuce, cheese, chicken, etc.  They are really tasty.  I think next time I'll just get the beans and cheese kind because their chicken is sooooo salty."}
{"text":"Viva Las Arepas' sandwiches with this arepa bread is unlike any other - Damn good.   I've first been to the Las Vegas Blvd location before coming here. They cook it with a wood-fire grill but I'm not sure if the same applies to this Rainbow location - I forgot to ask - but it's still delicious.   For five bucks I got the #4, roasted pork butt and when they asked if I wanted cheese and avocado, of course I said, \"yes please!\". There was a good portion of meat and this sandwich will definitely hit the spot for a quick meal.   Actually, like the Vegas Blvd location, it's not that quick. That's not a terrible thing because you know it's made to order, and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had!  The pictures don't do the food justice.  The fact that it's so cheap and the service is so good are an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Just discovered the pollo here!! It's fantastic. We drive all the way across town just to come here. They remember us when we come in as well. Definitely a great stop no matter what time of day or night!!"}
{"text":"This is my culture, definitely every time I come by to Vegas I'll make this my first and last place to be! Great food with great people."}
{"text":"My husband and I were catching a show at the Smith Center and didn't have time for a nice sit down lunch so we decided to mix it up and try out Viva. When you walk in you are transported to another country. The interior is orange and yellow with Spanish music on the radio. The man behind the counter is cordial but definitely gets down to business. I ordered the pork butt and my husband ordered the shredded beef. We decided to share an order of fried plantains and a mango drink. We chose a booth and waited for our number to be called. They were quick and everything is served on a tray with 2 squeeze bottles of condiments on the side. The Arepas were absolutely delicious! I loved the \"bun\" which is more like a thick and crumbly corn tortilla. It was delicate and delicious. The meat was melt in your mouth cooked to perfection. I even stole a few bites of my husband's and it was also absolutely perfect. The fried plantains were not my favorite, definitely going for the fries next time. The mango drink was not too sweet, but the perfect way to quench your thirst on a hot Vegas day. Overall, we loved the food and the price. We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Funky location, but yummy food! Tried the shredded beef and the shredded pork. I really liked the pork, my partner liked the beef. Both were yummy and each came with its own special sauce. Very tasty and a super deal. I can imagine this as a perfect hangover cure too. Luckily, that wasn't my experiece of it this time. I would like to go back and try more from their menu. Easy walk from the nearest Duece bus stop - North of the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"All I can say is 'DAMN\" delicious! Not only is the half chicken amazing, but the side salad is so tasty! Also ordered a beef empanada, which I might say is like HEAVEN in my mouth Very authentic and juicy. Service was good and the restaurant is clean, which is very important to me. YES YES YES, I WILL BE BACK!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"The flavors here are not out of this world. But I like eating authentic anything.   First time I went I got a pork butt arepa w avocado(6.50$)and fried plantains (3$). Both were tasty. Surprisingly filling. First \"venezuelan\" experience, first arepa ever.  Second time I went I ordered a carne asada arepa w cheese(5.50$) and french fries(3$). Nothing special. My carne asada was watery and the cheese was not melted . The french fries were below my standard for good/great quality. Just decent.  I would come back and get the pork butt arepa w plantains again. Its decent food. It beats fast food. Its inexpensive. And I hate eating on the Las Vegas strip for reasons I wont mention."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Cream was sour. Fried plantains were soaked in wells of oil. Forks and spoons were available only upon request. Tables were never cleaned. Spicy sauce tasted like fire. Hot chocolate tasted like sugar syrup. Arepas were so hard that my mouth hurt. Overall, disappointed ."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to find little treats like these off the main strip.   Although it's located in an area where you can tell the taxpayers money doesn't get used the business is very clean and the interior was designed on a fairly decent budget.   I phone ordered hoping to save time, which saved me some. No phone pick up system is in place so I still had to wait in a line that forced my food to lose some warmth.   Service  Friendly-ish, the man working the register had the swagger of an owner. He has answers to all your rookie arepa questions and will help you decide on what you want.   Las Arepas  Reina Pepiada: chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. The flavors are layered. The power of the chicken is smothered in the avocado which is hit with a hint of mayo and the mayo is hit with a dab of cilantro. 4.75/5  Pabellon: Beef, black beans, plantains and cheese. This was more of an obvious mixed taste rather than a subtle one.The beef and beans with the plantains with a cheesy start and finish. Good as well but not as chef d'oeuvre as the reina pepiada. 4/5  The masa: The texture and visual has a strong gordita resemblance. The taste is similar as well but cleaner, not as greasy oriented as a gordita. 4.2/5  Sides  Note: Getting fried foods to go will always take away from it's original texture so these will be rated on a +.75 curve.  Yucca Fries: Decent and made a good dip with the arepa sauce they provide for you. 3.75/5  Plantains: I've had better ones made inside my mom's kitchen. 3.25/5  Drinks  I had a Venezuelan soda \"colita\" that was far from special. Welches sodas are better than this. 2/5  Viva Las Arepas?  Si, viva. I loved the arepas. Tasty and something new I had not tried before and I am sure many of you have not either. You've got to try this place out when you're in Vegas. The prices are fair for those that aren't hoping to get by on MGM all day buffet passes. Just make sure to avoid the Venezuelan soda and go with their \"aguas frescas.\""}
{"text":"*Thumbs up* I've tried my fair share of arepas from various places, and this place has one of the better corn meal bun. It was super airy, fluffy, and had just the right amount of flavor so that it didn't detract from the filling. I had the shredded beef arepa, and I thought it was great on its own. With one of the two sauces, especially the spicy one, it just took it up another notch  *Thumbs down* Location is away north of the Strip, so not really walkable. But if you have car and you're looking for off-Strip good eats, this place should be on your list."}
{"text":"Been on da fence bout this place. Really don't like location. It's in that transition area from strip to downtown. Also never having had this cuisine I was skeptical to say the least. Walked in at a great time. No line. I got what I gathered from yelp as the good and was not disappointed. That wood kissed beef if flavorful on it own but the give you sauce. I prefer hot."}
{"text":"Oh my I love this little place! When we ride bikes its a perfect stop for a snack. Perfect as well for when you are out drinking. I love that they have vegetarian options. I believe I have had a few different types, and i prefer the black bean and cheese stuffed empanada.   Sooo GooD! Need to try MoOAR!!"}
{"text":"Another YELP score for me.  Had some pals in town and they wanted to do something light and different for dinner prior to heading down for the Fremont Street Experience.  I dug around a bit and came across Las Arepas.  The menu sounded great, the prices were great and the reviews were great.  With four cackling women in my car as I head north on Las Vegas Blvd I just about missed my opportunity to make an illegal u-turn into the correct parking lot.  The main sign is between a classic dive bar and a pizza joint.  Yelp indicated they were open on Sunday but the door was locked.  We walked around and then at the very last minute noticed the adjunct small structure right on the corner.  Almost like a stationary roach-coach.  As other people reviewed, the food was really great and the two young guys were super friendly.  Will post some photos later.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time in Las Vegas and I was pleasantly surprised to find this place. Fresh baked arepas and option to add extra toppings. Personally I went with the Reina Pepiada and a wood fire beef with extra fried egg avocado and cheese which was really good and fricking amazing. I will definitely come back again before leaving Las Vegas. Btw there is a coupon for 15 % off if you call ahead of time and show the coupon so make sure to grab one if you plan on returning."}
{"text":"This is out go to place when we can't decide on anything to eat! The added bonus is the gelato place next door. You can fill up on the best arepas I've ever had and head over for delicious gelato after. Incredible! The prices are relatively cheap and soooo delicious. I loooove the dessert empanadas also...I can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"I actually found this place on a random fluke.  I was eating at a nearby restaurant and my constant companion remarked that he'd never eaten Venezuelan food before, so we should come back and try this place.  Since then I've been to Viva Las Arepas several times -- usually with visitors in tow.  It's one of my favorites and a nice find on the North end of the Strip.  My favorite is the chicken Arepa (with cheese, dripping in the creamy cilantro sauce).  It's my favorite because the chicken tastes of this fantastic smokey flavor I've not found elsewhere in Vegas.  I've also had their whole chicken (a favorite with my constant companion) and the meat just melts in your mouth.  Is it a healthy choice for your stay in Las Vegas?  Probably not.  However, it is likely one of the most delicious.  I once took my fabulously unadventurous younger brother here, and he and his friends absolutely loved it.  To address concerns raised by other visitors -- yes the restaurant itself is not in a particularly glitzy part of town; however, it is in an area that is in the process of being revitalized.  The restaurant is clean and well kept, and I've never had any problems in the neighborhood.  The food is worth it!  I have plans to go back in the near future."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The pork spare ribs are simply amazing. The empanadas are what drew me in initially... and they are crazy good as well. Definitely a place worth the drive into downtown."}
{"text":"I must say!! They have not missed a beat!! Place is very clean the bathroom is very clean! The staff is extremely nice!! I love the location I love the corner I love the patio. There is no reason why anyone shouldn't stop by and try this place out!! Food tasted great!! The price is spot on!!"}
{"text":"um, this place doesn't even need my review. i don't know why i'm bothering. probably because it's THAT DAMN GOOD.  there was one week i went 4 times. i think i ordered the cachapas every time. the pericos are good, too. the dude who works the counter and i are pals now. i got a cheese empanada today, and i don't want to get too graphic here, but maaaan... i will definitely be cheating on the cachapas with the empanada in my dreams tonight...  i wish this place wasn't a 3-4 minute bicycle ride from my house. but at least i get a little bit of exercise before i clog my arteries? ;)  THANK YOU FOR EXISTING!  many hearts from your #1 fan, Maegan"}
{"text":"This place is A-ok. Their arepas are not the best I have had all around but it's pretty good.  I must say that I had trouble finding this place! They had recently moved across the street from their previous location, which is now a hot dog stand, when I first visited. I had to call and ask them where their new location is.  When we got there we ordered all the popular items listed on yelp. The food was decent but not amazing.  Their service is great though. So for that I give them 3 stars. My experience wasn't bad nor has it been amazing that I would want to go back for more.  If you've never had arepas, this is a perfect place to try them out!"}
{"text":"Great find. We went to the more expensive restaurants and buffet's ($70 p/person!), and this restaurant was the only one we made a return visit.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The Reina Pepiada arepa is awesome, as is the green sauce they bring to the table.  If you want an arepa, just be sure to specify \"arepa\" because some of the entrees have the same name."}
{"text":"La mejor comida Venezolana en Las Vegas!!!!! Volvere manaña porque no pude probar todo el menú. La arepa de mechada es alucinante, lo mismo las empanadas y el tequeño."}
{"text":"This place is Arepa's heaven!! Everything was so delicious that can't even explain. Perfect flavors, the cilantro salsa a must try. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I pulled some seriously dangerous driving maneuvers when I saw this little stand on the corner in Vegas.  Arepas outside of South America?  + from a little building that is just barely bigger than a hot dog cart? I'm in.  First off, I LOVE arepas. I go to South America a lot, + arepas are these little fried corn patties stuffed with all kinds of things, usually deep fried + heaven at 3am after a night of dancing that they sell on the streets of Colombia and Venezuela. They're like the drunk-munchies equivalent of seasoned curly fries here in the U.S.  The guy working there was also the owner, + he could not have been sweeter. This was my boyfriend's first arepa experience, + the owner asked him questions + made suggestions for what he might enjoy. We ordered our arepas, + he threw in a free empanada because my boyfriend had never tried one of those either.  The arepas here aren't the same greasy deep-fried ones I'm used to, but they are SUPER delicious.  the corn casings are really fresh, + the ingredients are fresh, warm, + delicious. He serves his food with sides of jalapeno and cilantro sauce to give them an extra kick if you like heat on your food.  There's also a big assortment of tropical juice that's really fresh + inexpensive (plus, refills are only $.99: such a bargain!).  It's always nice to see owners taking pride in their work, + the owner came out to deliver our food himself, + stayed to chat with us while we ate.  Really pleasant experience, + a nice cap to a weekend in The Vegas."}
{"text":"One star for service only.... Although arepas are always delicious here I must say my order was a huge disappointment.   After spending $40 on an large order for my family, the cashier guy taking our order clearly was not paying attention nor was he an  engaged employee- no attention to detail here. He appeared very distracted, (I should have known as this would be been my first clue our order was going to be completely wrong just by the way he was taking our order; he never made good eye contact (direct eye contact assures confidence vs. Looking over our heads or to the left or the right but not at us) instead he was looking at the TV & I couldn't believe he was actually watching it during & while I was ordering, *he handed the tv controls to somebody during order taking which also showed his mind was someplace else. Overall he messed up and one of the major mistakes he made didn't include a $4 sauce he said \"ok\" to at the time I ordered.   (At some point this error was rectified by management who gave us a complimentary sauce due to his employees lack of attention/error) but what is really making me upset enough to write this review was after all was said and done and my family got home to start eating arepas, our order was flipping WRONG!!  Ugghh! So frustrated & disappointed because I knew- I actually knew this guy was gonna mess this order up in which he did!!  Please re- train your cashier for better customer service skills, include the part where you must pay attention to what your customer is ordering, maby go a little further to repeat order back to the customer especially when its a large one, (This guy had black hair, glasses, tattoos, so if he takes your order make sure you ask him if he got it correct) Then maby you wouldn't receive a negative review from an upset patron....   P.S. due to the way Arepas were wrapped, it would have been difficult to unwrap & open each one to check the filling inside each arepa for correcting."}
{"text":"This place sucks...food was gross I went with an easy can't go wrong type of plate which is rice beans and platano Frito and they couldn't do that now imagine the rest of the food that actually needs cooking and care for...I do not recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a tour of antique shops in the area. Stopped in to check it out. I had the roasted pork butt Arepas, an order of fried plantain and a black bean and cheese empanada. I thoroughly enjoyed all of these items. I sampled my friends fresh corn with cheese cachapa and it was delicious. After eating I tried the cane sugar and lime drink. The drink was good but very strong on the lime for anyone that has had a sugarcane drink before. The service and food was great definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Absolute perfection! Couldn't resist trying both pork and beef Arepas, super filling, but every bite was true heaven! Texture, flavor, freshness, all flawless. As if I was the recipient of a chef's competition winner. Hope they can come to California soon..."}
{"text":"After having an aprea from the Rika Arepa food truck a few weeks back, I wanted to come back here to compare. Bottom line, this place is good, but not nearly as good as Rika.   Between the 2 times I've been here, I've had the garlic shrimp, shredded beef, pepiada, and fried plantains. Out of all of these, the fried plantains stand out more than the sandwiches. The fillings for the arepas are decent, but they're just missing something...like maybe plantains?! I think this is maybe why I liked Rika so much- they had plantains in the sandwich! The shredded beef would be taken to a whole new level with this simple addition. The two sauces I was offered were good, especially the spicy green one, but once again I liked the 2 sauces from Rika better.   This place will do for a quick fix for an arepa craving, but to really curb my craving I'll need to go on a food truck hunt!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The taste is very good and the portion size of the arepas are just right. The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap arepas close to the Stratosphere? Check! Any of the wood-fired meats are delicious."}
{"text":"I work right across the street from this place... pass by it all the time, but never went in. One of our managers provided lunch for us today, and my goodness, these are delicious. I had a shredded chicken and a carne asada arepa. They have a yummy, spicy dark green sauce that is perfect on them. The bread/bun... don't even get me started on that. It is perfectly soft like an English muffin. I will definitely be eating there more often and trying the different types. Some coworkers swore that the breakfast style one with eggs, onions, and tomatoes etc was also very tasty."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Vegas!  Truly amazing value and the food is off the hook!   Eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Great Venezuelan cuisine. It very casual, you order at the counter. The empanadas and the arepas (sort of like a torta with a corn wrap) were both delicious. It was my first time eating Venezuelan food. Cheap and amazing, check it out!"}
{"text":"YOU AIN'T DOWN for I Love AREPAS !  Authentic Venezuelan food has hit the streets or should I say the strip, or should i say across the strip.....club (OG gentlemen club that is) hahaha! Have you ever had Arepas? There basically mini sandwiches made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, filled with different toppings! Need another description ? If a Mexican Torta and El Salvadorian Papusa had a baby a Venezuelan Arepa would pop out!  Super BOMB Latin flavor explosions !  Chef Felix and Chef Alix are bringing Vegas some Fresh Venezuelan ingredients all in one little food stand! I Love Arepas has been only open for 4 months and it's already the talk of the town. Don't be surprised if there's a long line or long wait, good food takes time and patience. Also the cilantro mayo and the green salsa is a must for every bite! And for my last tip refresh yourself with there super bomb natural fruit juices, pick any flavor there all good!  Visit: ILovearepasLv.com"}
{"text":"I got the chance to try this Venezuelan spot. Upon recommendation, I tried the Carne Asada Arepa and Chicken empanada. The arepa was so flavorful and the meat was packed  it was hard to take a bite without the meat falling out...I had to use a fork. To complement the arepa, the server gave me two different sauce: mayo with avocado and a spicy green sauce. Both tasted good, but I like spicy. The empanada was light and fluffy and chicken has the right kick to it.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I stopped by the stand on my way into Dino's for karaoke. Service was quick---Felix, the owner/manager was very friendly and offered samples of different fillings, like reina pepiada (a chicken salad with avocado and green peas) and tripa. Ended up getting the classics: frijoles negros con queso (black beans and cheese) and pollo machado (shredded chicken). The arepas are very good sized-- I have been to other places that give you arepas the size of dollar coins. Not here!! The arepas are 4 inches of authentic tastiness. I wish I wasn't just visiting this weekend so I could eat here all the time... In fact, I think I'll go again tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The arepas are, not surprisingly, great. But it's also a great place to get steak, and the mixed grill is off the hook. Tropical juices as well. There was a good gelato place next door but not sure if it's still open."}
{"text":"I was planning a road trip and head on in to the Vegas Yelp Talk page and asked a question; I can only eat at one place, where do I stop? The answer? Viva Las Arepas.  Say no more, bookmark it, set navigation, go.  I'm not even a little bit pissed. This place is fantastic. For any Phoenicians reading, this place is Chino Bandito good. The type of place I'll lay in bed and think about.  Arepa's are packed with the most incredibly flavored meat you'll ever have the privelage of lodging in to your gullet. Wood fired is king. Arepas is king of wood fire. Arepas is the emporer of food.  Enough about the Arepas. Let's talk about Cachapa. More travelled people have already heard of this food. I was just pointing at one of each of everything and discovered this delight.  I love Cachapas. I love Cachapas."}
{"text":"I LOVE AREPAS TOO!!!  I have to say, I was born and raised in Venezuela, and these arepas on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming are just like if they were made  by my own mother! holly cow! I had tear in my eye when I had the first bite!  I had to call my family back home in Venezuela to share with them the joy of having \"authentic\" Venezuelan food...  The place, is typical, very similar to what you would find in any corner in a Venezuelan city. The food, all fresh, made from scratches, with real corn flour, and made in front of your eyes. All the ingredients are prepared daily and the rest is just enjoy and invite!!!   Its totally worth to visit, prices are very affordable and the attention 5 stars! Next time you are arond, stop by and you will see what I am talking about!!!  Pa'l Gocho!  (Del Maracucho)"}
{"text":"Driving past Vegas on the 15 north and had to stop for gas and we were starving. Not the best neighborhood, but it was close. Venezuelan food?  Sure!  Why not!  Very friendly and helpful service as neither of us were familiar with the cuisine.  Everything we got was freshly cooked in house, and tasty. I probably won't be back through , but if I was I would probably check it out and try it again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The flavor is outstanding and the service even better. Friendly staff. I try to get the arepa #7 once a week."}
{"text":"Worth its weight in Gold. I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants something authentic and delicious! The food comes out strait from their firewood grill and is simply to die for! Viva Las Arepas please make your way to Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Surprising find! Authentic, cheap and delicious Venezuelan food minutes away from the Stratosphere Hotel. Fresh empanadas, excellent (super-filling) sandwiches. I got the vegetarian, which is black beans with avocado etc. The home made tortillas (gluten free) is different compared to the Mexican tortilla I'm used to. You gotta be hungry if you eat here. They don't look massive, volume-wise, but they are heavy and delicious! Empanadas are good to-go food on a side trip to the Vegas casinos nearby..."}
{"text":"Hooooolllyyyyy moly!! What did I just experience there?!?! I came with a group of friends who had been fans of the place forever!!! They knew what to expect and I did not. The Yelp reviews were glowing and the pictures looked insane.  I knew immediately I would try the 7, which is chicken, Mayo, avocado and god knows what else. It was amazing. Then I tried the 12 which was beef, black beans and plantain. We also ordered a side of yucca root and fried plantains. The drink was a pineapple/mango Fresca. I honestly just found a new junk food favorite!!!! I'm so excited to return!!"}
{"text":"Love at first bite!   Wow! Wow! Wow!   Finally had the chance to enjoy this Venezuelan treasure!   My gal pal and I got the Royal treatment on our first visit!   I ordered a Pepsi with my order, and the Head Chef/Owner Felix gave me a sample of the Passion fruit juice, I said yes I'll have that!!!!!   Natural Fruit Juices...Mango and Passion fruit mmmmm so yummy!  You must order a fruit juice, forget soda. Trust me!   I ordered a shredded beef empanada, my friend ordered two different types of Arepas, we both got a natural fruit juice.   We sat in my (air conditioned) car to eat as it was hot hot hot outside and this was 10pm at night, ugh. They brought us our order to the car where an awesome conversation was started with the Owner Felix.   So we chatted with Felix for a bit at the car, we informed him it was our first time trying them out. He gave us a bit of the History behind it all and how he previously worked with Mario Batali!   He said I must try something so he went and made a Reina Pepiada Arepa for me to try! He told me I am the Reina Pepiada, whatever that means, lol Wow, it was Amazing! Delicious, melted in my mouth, full of flavor!   He also wanted me to try his Cod empanada since I told him how much I love seafood. Mmmmmm yummy soooooo good, that also melted in my mouth like butta! The best way I have ever eaten cod fish in my life, in form of an empanada. Not just any Empanada but his which is the best!   He also made a beef empanada for my girl Karen to try, mmmm she loved it, the best empanada ever.   Felix...thank you for treating us so special and taking the time to hang out with us! You truly hooked us up and spoiled us so well!  We will be back sooner than you think!   Muchos Besos!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have good food, nice place to hang and excellent service!! Go there every time I have a change. Recommend: carne asada and limonada de panela!"}
{"text":"How do I love thee, Las Arepas? Let me count the ways!  While in Las Vegas for a 4 day conference, we opted to go with one vendor for all of our food needs. Our group leans liberal so we had more vegetarians, gluten-free, vegan, non-dairy types onboard than is typical.   No problem, said Viva Las Arepas. They hooked us up meal after meal. They prepared the food and drove it to our location, set everything up and served our group buffet style. Then they cleaned up after themselves and took everything with them.   Our guests were over the moon for the breakfast arepas. And everyone was raving about all of the dinner options. They did a great job of mixing things up so that we weren't just eating arepas, arepas, arepas for 4 days.   They were great. We were very pleased with the price, the flavor, the service, the promptness and the good attitudes of the entire crew.   Would definitely recommend for an event again. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I am venezuelan, so I can say this is as aunthetic as it gets. For those of you who are new to arepas try the pabellon one, its sweet and salty all it one bite. The place is beautiful and clean and prices are super reasonable. Great job!"}
{"text":"So Felix has moved the business to a brick and mortar store just a few stores down.  The little kiosk in the parking lot next to the diner or whatever is still open, but he manages both places now.  It took two years from when he first set up store at the kiosk til he opened up his sit down restaurant.  That's quite respectable.  I could tell that Felix was still working out the kinks, but despite a long day of managing and teaching his employees, he still provided us superior service.    The upgrade to five stars is not only for the service, but I am now very impressed with the reina pepiada.  Often times when I get it, there is a lack of flavor.  This is thus far the best one I've tasted in the States.  Also cachapas con queso, which was my second favorite thing in the meal.  The cornmeal shell was actually sweet, and I really like sweet and savory combinations.  Also we got the tostones (but they called it something else) and the yucca fries.  The tostones were a bit over fried, but at least my husband was ok with that.  The cachapas were initially over fried, so Felix brought out a second one on the house.    I really like supporting small businesses, esp ones that provide such good food and service like this one.  We will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Umm Arepas should be a couple of dollars at the most. A cheese Arepa is $5 bucks and add a plate of beans and rice and some Passionfruit juice we are now heading into the $12 territory. Lame.."}
{"text":"Boyfriend had a gig so we ended up staying at the Stratosphere. After a long 6 hour drive we were starving so we found this place on yelp. We wanted to try something other than the usual Raising Canes or Aloha Kitchen and since we've never had Venezuelan food, we thought we'd give this place a shot. It was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  I ordered the Reina Pepiada which was a cold filling of chicken, mayo, avo, and cilantro. Boyfriend got a hot filling of roasted pork butt with tomato slices.  The arepas were pretty much small sandwiches with LOTS of filling. Don't underestimate the size. I had trouble finishing my own! The tortilla(?) they used as the \"buns\" reminded me of what they use for tamale wraps. And omg the sauces they provide you with are EVERYTHING. I drenched each bite with both!!! I read on Yelp that people were stealing the sauces so they don't give you the bottles until after you receive your meal. LOL! I would've been one of those perpetrators...  Don't forget to order either the mango or guava drink to wash the food down.  We'll be back to get more of the Reina Pepiada. That was a winner in our books!"}
{"text":"I gave this  restaurant 5 stars because of the quality of the food, service and cleanliness of the dining room. It is closer to downtown than the bustling Strip area on LV Blvd which is nice but more people should be able to visit this wonderful restaurant. Good job and love the exotic juices from the South American / Caribbean Areas."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! I tried the Arepa con perico, and it was delicious!! The authentic Venezuelan flavor!! i strongly recommend the \" Tequeños with guasacaca\" and for dessert try the \"quesillo\". Don't forget to ask for a \"papelon\". So glad to find Venezuelan food in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical because of the location but when you walk in it's clean and the restrooms are clean too!   The staff is friendly and for my first time the owner took our order. He recommended everything (as expected) and I ended up with the Wood Fire Chicken. After I finished my first one, I went back to order more for later.  One Arepa is filling, 2 Arepas will make you really full. I love this place! I can't wait to bring my friends from out of town here!   Get the Wood Fire Chicken or Beef with a Passionfruit drink!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to drop 5 stars on this place. Probably the best part of my Vegas trip.   My first time trying arepas, but I have eaten a ton of Mexican and Salvadorean food. The difference here is the corn meal used to make the arepas. If you love grits amd hispanic food like I do, the arepa will be your new best friend. Perfect combination of flavor and crispy texture.   The prices are insanely cheap, so it makes you feel like a winner even if you lose your rent money at the casino. Not saying that I did, just sayin'"}
{"text":"Seriously tasty food, cooked over live coals.    Just minus 1 star because you will leave this place smelling like those live coals.  They need better ventilation or something.  Just wear something you don't mind smelling like a smokehouse afterwards."}
{"text":"Well after all these years I finally got down to Viva Las Arepas, I know we are locals and 10 miles you would think is not a big deal, well it's on the strip and we normally stay away.  Anyway, after having spent quite a bit of time in Venezuela back in the mid 90's I was quite excited to try this. First impressions, when you walk in, it's clean, well lit, and has the outstanding smell of meat being smoked.  Menu is on a board and you walk up to order, very straight forward.  I ordered 2ea Pulled smoked chicken Arepas, and 2ea Beef empanadas, order of tostones, and fried Yuca.  I was so excited to take this home and share with my spouse since she has only heard me talk about it.  By the way staff are very pleasant and attentive, I watch as a gentlemen came out and was pulling finished platters from the tables, and the bathroom was clean.  My wife would have been impressed.  Got home and the meal was outstanding, just liked I remembered, the Arepas are big and stuffed full, one was enough for me along with the sides.  Empanadas were great along with the Yuca, and tostones.  This place has definitely earned and deserves its five stars.  While not on the best part of the strip, the parking lot right off the strip offers plenty of space and I could tell at night it would be very well lit."}
{"text":"So, I have a thing for zombies. Fast zombies, slow zombies, evil zombies, dead zombies, live zombies, zombies with souls, brain-eating zombies, vegan zombies, rotting zombies -- you name it, I don't discriminate.  I tell you this because, deep in my bones, I believe that The Zombie-pocalypse is imminent. On occasion, I contemplate prepping a go-bag for the day it happens. In addition to the necessities such as puppies and kittens, suspenders, mint juleps, Uggs (as previously referenced), and a pure white bathrobe, it is essential I obtain one fresh meal prior to the collapse of civilization.  Allow me to present the Yelpzombie scale:  FIVE: Would push mother into approaching zombie horde in order to obtain (In-n-Out). FOUR: Would give up left arm to be gnawed on by zombified best friend (Chick-fil-A). THREE: Would trade one roll of toilet paper for (Jack in the Box). TWO: Viva Las Arepas. ONE: Given a choice of an Oprah marathon and ___________, Oprah wins. (McDonalds. Not counting Sausage Egg McMuffins here.)  As you can see, I have a refined palate. Is there any doubt that I am a true foodie?  ---------------------------------------------------------  Back to business. You could get an arepa for ~$5.50, but without cheese (+$.50), avocado ($+.99), and a fried egg ($.99), what's the point? You wouldn't be getting the full experience. So we're up to 8 bucks. And you won't be full. Your stomach will curse you for your stinginess and punish you with pangs of fury. Now throw in fries, yucca root, or plantains for $3.00, and you're sitting at $11.00. Even with the extras and factoring in that some of you have pinholes for mouths, you will certainly consume your arepas in 3 bites, give or take 2 bites.  Post-tax, that's a 4:1 bite to dollar ratio. FOUR dollars per bite! Now let's take a look at French Laundry. The tasting menu runs 10 courses long and will set you back a mere $295. If we say each course is 8 bites, after tax and tip, it comes out to 4 dollars per bite. So, think hard, Viva Las Arepas or French Laundry? The answer is obvious. Don't fight math.  As an aside, Yelp, can you add a dollar:bite field to restaurant listings? Please? Imagine how much more engaging eating and review-writing would be. Every bite would literally be counted. And each bite could be individually reviewed. How much fun would that be? We'd all eagerly embrace it, especially the elites. Don't even deny that it wouldn't happen.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Our table ordered three different arepas, the plantains, and the yucca. I got the beef (aka carne asada, yes, the translation makes little sense). I loved the plaintains -- they were deep fried and carmelized. Everything else was plain. Even drenching the arepas in the provided sauces could not salvage the bland mediocrity that I had invited into my mouth. I asked my dining mates to describe the two sauces and here is what our committee of three decreed:  Sauce one: lighter green, spicer, less creamy. Sauce two: darker green, less spicy, more creamy.  So descriptive, you're welcome. Now that I've saved you the trouble of spending your precious time and money here, let's discuss what you'd put in your go-bag."}
{"text":"I was in tastebud heaven here...I went two nights in a row and devoured their cheese and bean arepa, carnitas arepa, and their corn and cheese arepa which was by far out of this world. I washed that down with a guava water that was sooo refreshing. Ooh!!! And that delicious extremely spicy complimentary salsa they give out my god. I cannot wait to make it out to Vegas to visit this little place once again."}
{"text":"Not in the nicest area of Las Vegas but definitely worth a visit.  Our party of seven all enjoyed our menu choices and ate every bite.  Reasonably priced, decent portion size, quality ingredients and pleasant, friendly service.  The Asada Arepas along with the Plato Carne Asada, The Reina Pepiada w/Cheese were all perfectly cooked and tender.  The fries were delicious, very well seasoned and crisp.  A good choice for an affordable, delicious, quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"If a quick, local, easy-on-the-budget delicious meal is on your itinerary then this spot will not dissapoint. It's  a little worn down, in a part of town I would best describe as 'sketchy', but clean and a convenient location if you happen to be downtown or checking out 'First Friday'.  If you're looking for gourmet food, this isn't your stop, but check it out if you want consistently delicious, filling food reminiscent of what your grandmother would make. It's also decently priced and quickly made.  I would recommend the fried plantains. They are great and not something you can find on many menues (fried bananas which are sweet but compliment a savory meal -not dessert). They of course have the meat staples, chicken, steak, and pork but have a vegetarian option as well.   Lastly, if you're looking for a late meal after a night of drinking - you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't want some good arepas. If you never had an arepa, you're missing out on some good maize meal dough and and filled with some delicious cheese, meats, and other yummy ingredients.  If you're scared of drug addicts and bums hanging out in the parking lot, then don't come here at night. But it ain't that bad, you can handle it, it's still on the Strip. Come for lunch instead if you a wuss.  All the arepas are made to order so it might take awhile. But worth the wait. If you're really hungry, order 2. If you're full, still order 1 and enjoy it. Get some of that soursop/guanabana juice while you're here too, it's refreshing.  I ordered a pork butt arepa with cheese. Just look at my picture and your mouth will water already. I don't even have to describe it, it tastes just as good as it looks!  Viva arepa!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a treasure.  Went for dinner, at first was not sure because we thought it was \"take out\" only  but decided to stay and have dinner there.  We couldnt believe the delicious,  authentic,  amazingly well priced arepas. Shared a chicken one, a shredded beef and a corn cheese one.  What a treat!  Came back for breakfast and was equally pleased.  Will always come back when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow. Omg. Wow to the garlic shrimp arepa. SO flippin good! I'm so mad I didn't get 2 lol. One star off bc the beef empanada I got was just ok and nothing special. I can't wait to go back already for more arepas!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously... everyone should try this place! It's one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Arepa de pabellon #12 is amazing. Also the coconut and cheese pastelitos are really good for dessert. The people that work there are always very nice too! Check this place out! If it was closer to Summerlin, I'd be there every week lol!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with arepas, and the Pernil Arepa from Viva Las Arepas was the best I've had. The pork was outrageously juicy and the avocado we added for a little extra was the perfect complement. Couldn't possibly have been any better."}
{"text":"I love hole-in-the-walls. I love arepas. I love empanadas.   Had one of each for lunch after roasting at the premium outlets and was so absolutely satisfied. We also tried the grilled chicken and it was SO YUMMY. Came with sides of plantains and black beans. Both were done very well. For some reason I don't feel guilty at all eating this savory food... I mean it's gluten free and wood roasted. That means healthy right?   Prices are definitely cheap and there's a small parking lot out front. Owners are super nice and I would absolutely frequent this place often if I still lived in Vegas. Perfect spot to regain energy after a long morning of shopping!"}
{"text":"The cachapas and arepas are pretty sick. It's all about the green sauce though. Thanks for hooking us up, Felix :)  The plantains are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with a friend, this is the first time I've been here since they open this location, they used to be on the little joint on the corner of LV blvd and Wyoming. The prices are kind of high but the food is really good, not sure if good enough to pay $6 dlls for arepas"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food! They catered one of our company lunch-meetings, and I could not stop going back for more. We had more than enough food for every employee, but ate every last bite. I had never eaten Venezuelan food before, and I am a serious fan after eating here. I had the wood-fired shredded chicken and pebellon arepas. To die for!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I eat here, the Patacones are AWESOME and you can choose whatever meat you like on it The Arepas are good too! Love their sauces"}
{"text":"Ask for the garlic shrimp arepa WARMED. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Vegas perfect for a budget traveler. The arepas are amazing! The bathrooms are very clean, the place overall is very welcoming and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I always get the reina pepiada, rice, beans, and a cachapa. The employees here are friendly are very helpful when it comes to explaining the menu. I frequent this place very often and always try to bring friends and family. Every person I've brought here loves the food. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place was alright but takes awhile for the food to get done and the portions are small. I did not like their frijoles negros (black beans) they tasted like warmed up Goya beans from the can. Besides that my empanada, pastellito, and plantanos fritos (fried plantains) were delicious."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this arepas spot for a while now and finally got a chance last weekend. We came during lunch and the place wasn't busy at all. We only tried arepas, but their menu is extensive and there are so many different menu items to choose from, I look forward to trying empanadas as well during my next visit.   The texture was great and I loved the flavor combinations. The salsas were really great and spicy to boot. I was hoping they would be a little cheaper, but I didn't feel like they were too expensive, just more than I was expecting.   I look forward to coming back again really soon."}
{"text":"We were confused when we got here.  We had no idea what an arepa was, but we enjoy trying all ethnic foods.  This was our first time trying Venezuelan food.    Based on the staff's explanations of the food, we decided on several items.  The first item that we tried was called the Reina pepiada.  This arepa was loaded with shredded chicken, avocado, mayo, cilantro, and green peas.  It was pretty tasty, but I liked the other 3 items better.  The second item was garlic shrimp.  As the name says, the arepa was filled with garlic shrimp and it was delicious.  The third item was Lengua.  This arepa was filled with beef tongue, bell peppers, tomato, onion, and garlic.  It was yummy.  The last item was the Pernil arepa.  It is roasted pork butt inside.  It was marinated just right, and it was my favorite of the four items.  The location is not great, but the staff is really cool and helpful.  I recommend giving them a try.  We will be back.    Oh, and another plus is you can go to Luv It Custard for dessert cause it is located really close by!!"}
{"text":"If I had an option to give zero stars I would! For service alone! The food is mediocre the service was horrible I would definitely not come here again! My husband brought me and our three children to dinner. We had been to the Main Street location many times but thought we would try the one closest to home this time worst idea. My husband order each of us an arepa and our 2 oldest kids a leg and thigh plate with rice and French fries, 1 mango Fresca and a frescolita (can soda) that bill was $31.88. then he got another mango drink for himself and one for me also it was 6.50. Neither of us liked our arepas (we tried ones we hadn't had before) so he went and order plantains and the arepa we liked to see if it was that we just didn't like what we ordered or if it was the difference in the cook from the other restaurant. That third bill was &11.70. My husband was asking the manager if they could make the plantains with crema and queso but the manager was making rude comments like wow you guys came with a real big appetite tonight huh pretty much fat shaming us! So he ordered the plantains only to make us not look like we were hippopotamus because god forbid we spend more money in his restaurant. Moral to this story eat at your own risk especially if the manager is there!"}
{"text":"Fresh healthy gluten free budget friendly food.  Love the Arepas  #2 and #7 and shredded beef empanadas.  Highly recommend a quick stop at lunch or anytime.   Stop by and try them. You won't regret it.  Service is Fantastic and quick."}
{"text":"this place was boomb, it has good sauces, and flavorful shredded meat."}
{"text":"It's always nice exploring new spots off the strip when I'm visiting Vegas. So many times have I been stuck eating at a hotel out of convenience because no one else wanted to leave. I've wanted to come here for awhile despite my bad experiences with arepas at other spots. It's located north of the strip in what looks like sketchier area with   Arepa is like a sandwich, but the meat is sandwiched between 2 flatbreads made of maize dough. The corn bun was crispy on the edges and much softer in the center.  Arepas: 1) Reina Pepiada consists of chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. I was expecting the chicken breast to be dry, but it was actually the opposite.  2) Wood Fire Beef: This was fantastic! I added on avocado, cheese, and egg, which made it even better. The small pieces of juicy, tender beef were so yummy.  The empanadas were also pretty good, but the winner is definitely the arepas.  Drinks: Mango - Thick, sweet drink that was really mangoey.  Service: They got my order wrong and gave me pulled pork instead. They apologized and gave me an extra empanada for the inconvenience. SCORE!"}
{"text":"I went looking for this little gem after a night out downtown.  We stumbled up right around closing time, but the staff were still really friendly and accommodating.  I didn't even bother looking at anything on the menu besides the arepas.  I mean, it's called Viva Las Arepas right? Not Viva las other stuff on the menu.  I got the pork arepa.  It was savory, cheesy, ridiculous goodness between two moist cornmeal buns.  This place makes me wish I had four cow stomachs so I could physically put more arepas in my body.  The arepas look small, but I think they're perfectly portioned and definitely satisfying."}
{"text":"I lost my mind over the half chicken. I don't know what Samantha G. got but that chicken was spot on- crispy skin, hint of smokey, finger lickin' greasy, just salty enough and so good I ate a leg and took a bite out of my husband's wing- I'm a picky chicken eater and usually skip these parts. Frankly, I like chicken fine but am not the biggest fan in my family- THIS chicken however- wow. I cannot wait to go back and get the meat platter. I might disaparate in happiness.  Oh- Arepas also very good. Can't rave about the texture (I found it a bit crumbly) but the Pernil (pork butt) was off the charts good. We got it with avocado and I recommend you do the same.  I second the \"crack sauce\" suggestion- it would make shoe leather taste good.  Mango agua fresca also very good- not too sweet as it often is at a Taqueria.  So - why no 5 stars? Well, maybe I'm being overly picky because that chicken was amazing, but I do five stars for a home run and their sides were lackluster and the arepa was a little dry. Is this overly harsh?   The bathroom was functional and clean but not good enough to bump them to 5 stars, I liked the small utilitarian steel sink, but not a lot else to commend it..  I'm gonna stick with 4 stars on this but let's call this \"unequivocally recommended.\" We'll see what happens after that meat platter."}
{"text":"A Colombian friend introduced me to arepas and taught me how to make them. Now I don't have to make them, I can go to Viva Las Arepas! I went in today for the first time, and I will be going back. Walking in you see a clean, shiny, new restaurant with a Grade A rating. What you smell is the mesquite grill cranking out some tasty meats. I talked for a while with the friendly man at the counter, he answered my questions, and I ordered a pabellon arepa (shredded beef, black beans, sweet plantain, and cheese, maybe cotija) and a shredded chicken empanada. The owner came up to the counter and greeted me then offered me a free container of real-deal homemade chicken soup. It has a little bit of cajun heat and a lot of herbs. Excellent. I didn't see soup on the menu but ask them if you're interested. The pabellon arepa was delicious, will be trying some of the other arepas soon. It came with a dressing of mayonnaise, cilantro, and garlic. The arepa was good on its own, but I used the dressing on some of it just because the dressing is good too. The empanada was high level mesquite flavor. I toned it down with some more of the cilantro dressing. :) I was properly stuffed after eating these two items, only ate a tiny bit of the soup (too full). No worries, I'll reheat it later. Good job folks, I'll see you again."}
{"text":"They've moved! Across the street from their previous location and a huge upgrade from the shack.  I've never had Arepas before but now I crave it all the damn time after this place. It's a mix between Pupusas and Empanadas, but the masa is completely different than flour. It's crispy and mealy - so perfect. Also, it's stuffed like a sandwich, with lettuce, tomatoes, sauce. So maybe it's more like a burger? Regardless, it's the best.  Our group were fatasses and totally ordered for a family of 12 when it was only 4 of us. But we got to try everything so it was worth it.   My favorite arepas was the Reina Pepiada and Roasted Pork Butt! Can't go wrong with either. The shredded chicken empanada was good here too."}
{"text":"With the recommendations of two separate locals, we knew Viva Las Arepas needed to be a stop. It was a hearty one!  Two of us split 4 arepas, and that was a lot. Three is probably fine. Then again, when I think about the 4 we got, it'd be hard to choose 3 of the 4. They were all delicious! We got 4 of the ones marked as \"chef's special\": wood fire beef, wood fire chicken shredded, reina pepiada (chicken with avocado, mayo, and cilantro), and pabellon (plantains, cheese, black beans, beef). Seriously, delicious. Hard to choose a favorite; each were distinct with rich flavors. The reina pepiada was very unique, so I'd definitely suggest getting that.  Prices range from $5-$7 each, which I felt was a good price given the amount you got.   Chill, local spot and relatively quick meal. Check it out! Erp."}
{"text":"One night my husband and I came here because we saw how good the reviews were and we were on this side of town so we figured why not give it a try. It was a really great decision because it was super filling and delicious. I got an empanada and my husband bought 3 areas can't remember which ones because they were all different, but I got to try a piece of each of them and they did not disappoint! The inside of this place was really bright and orange from what I remember. There was a couple in front of us who took awhile ordering because it was their first time too, but I like how the staff was still attentive to us and thanked us for our patience. We didn't dine in because it was later in the evening, but next time we sure to dine in. For how much food is given and the price it is so worth the trip here."}
