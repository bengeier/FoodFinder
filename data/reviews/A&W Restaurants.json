{"text":"This place needs help.  First we waited in the drive thru for 7 minutes. So I thought maybe it's not working we drove around went inside, waited another 4 minutes no one.  We were about to leave and then someone came out... Then we placed our order for 3 root beer floats.  She left then came back... Said registers not opened, but could pay cash and she would give change? Really? Nope wanted to use my card... She just looked at me. I said never mind, sorry I inconvenience you and walked out.  Looked for hours they opened at 10am I was there at 11:20am. We went to sonic instead which was awesome! We will never go again to this a&w"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I wanted a root beer, that's it, and I sat in the drive thru line for 20 minutes before the guy behind me finally backed up so I could leave. Never again."}
{"text":"The prices were less then other fast food places...No cones for the ice cream and no ice...had to ask for it...It was fixed though..."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Firstly, there was no one at the counter for at least 5 minutes before someone came out. Nothing was stocked for drinks or condiments and there were no customers at all. The cashier never smiled not even looked at us while we were talking. And when we got our food it wasn't thoroughly cooked. The cheese was cold and the fries tastes like they had been sitting all day. 
I used to rave about A&W but this place is awful. I'll never be back."}
