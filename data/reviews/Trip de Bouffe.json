{"text":"It's like a mini \"Adonis\" supermarket with more finesse. Beautifully prepared lebanese appetizers and food. I don't see the link between the name of the place and Lebanon... It is confusing but hey surprise! It has baba ganoush and garlic sauce instead of imported ketchup or fancy old dry pasta. Great to have on the Plateau."}
{"text":"Quand j'ai su qu'il y avait maintenant un petit marché libanais sur Mont-Royal, mon coeur a fait un bond dans ma poitrine. Youpi. Plus besoin de prendre 3 autobus pour aller au Adonis ou attendre après mes parents. Quand je m'y suis rendue pour la première fois, j'étais sous le charme de tous les délices qu'ils avaient! Mais attention, comme le dit le dicton, l'habit ne fait pas le moine et je n'ai pas été satisfaite de ma sélection chez Trip de Bouffe.

 Tout d'abord, oubliez les feuilles de vigne farcies. Elles sont pas assez cuites. C'est supposé fondre dans la bouche et à la place, je me suis battue avec la feuille. Peu de farce en passant pour trop de feuilles. Le reste était correct, sans plus. Mais le hoummous, ça a été ma plus grande déception. On a dû le jeter. Il était mauvais. Avec un goût un peu 'poisson' ce qui est absolument pas normal pour du bon hoummous. J'ai été déçue. 

Mais j'ai aimé leurs boules de labneh au zaatar. C'est facile à faire, je le reconnais, mais c'était bon. Leur labneh n'est pas fait maison par exemple, ils le prennent d'un fournisseur qui s'appelle Marie Kaadé. C'est du bon labneh. ;)
 
Pour conclure, je n'y suis pas retournée depuis. J'ai été trop déçue. Je préfère retourner au Adonis où la bouffe est moins chère (oui les prix sont un peu trop élevés au Trip de Bouffe...) et faire moi-même mon hoummous."}
{"text":"Great little shop filled with delicious food.  My girlfriend and I have our lunch there almost every single day."}
{"text":"I dropped by here today. I've been coming to Trip de Bouffer for the past two years and every single time the service was amazing and the food has been consistently unreal. I'm a bit picky with mMiddle Eastern food since I grew up eating it from the best chef ever: my mom :). But the food here is pretty close to perfect. 

Recommended: I absolutely love their veggie kebbe, mouhamara, the veggie pizza, chicken rolls (soo good!), and my all time favourite stuffed veggie vine leaves!

As for prices, super cheap. The food is so filling. Everything is approximately a $1 and you get a deal if you get 1/2 a dozen etc. nothing expensive, well worth the great quality of food. 

10/10!!!!!!!!

{"text":"We just wonder in during a street fair , great falafel sandwich. Great Middle Eastern pita bread. The best pita bread I ever had, so fresh made that morning I am sure. We wish we bought more food to take home to Vermont. We will definitely go again ."}
{"text":"Sunday morning \"breakfast\" including spinach fatayer, kebbes and sambouseks at a newly open Lebanese bakery on the Plateau, Trip de Bouffe. Everything was fresh and tasty.

Baklava: light and flaky, right amount of syrup on each layer, sign of freshness"}
{"text":"This place is what i call a lil gem in the city. Its a lebanese Bakery full of home made  lebanese/Arab inspired goodies like Tabouleh , baba ganoush, Sambusac , baklava and an assortment of mixed salads, rice and meat dishes.  You can also find a variety of nuts , spices , juice, breads, yogourt, syrup drinks ( i hope you guys know of mint syrup or your life is missing something fundamental ) and the thing that i find most exciting : Olive oil - that you can actually sample before buying - offered in regular glass bottles or big metal bottles with a small faucet! 

 + so many more things to discover. An exciting little store for any food lover!

This place is perfect  to come and pick up a lunch if you work around the mount royal area or pick up some of your favourite lebanese goodies ( i picked up some fresh whole wheat flat bread and humous )...and also just to discover some new flavours!"}
{"text":"Once you've eaten the pitas from this place, you'll never want to eat another grocery store pita again. You know they are made without loads of preservatives, because they go stale after only a few days, but with pitas this good its rare they will long enough to get to that point (stick 'em in the freezer if you can't eat them all in a day or two). And a trip to Trip de bouffe means the opportunity to stock up on dips and salads, and that's never a bad thing. I'm in love."}
{"text":"Tastes like delicious home cooking every time.
The salads I have had: moudardara,  hearts of palm, lima bean marinated beets are on point.
The hot dishes we always get are tchek (I am sure I have probably misspelled that), chicken and rice are succulent. There are also Lebanese sandwich I dream about on a regular basis is the all-dressed spicy chicken with garlic sauce. Until you have eaten one of these you have simply not lived"}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe d'origine libanaise.
Tout est bon et abordable.

Un vrai régale en service traiteur quand on est mal pris le soir et qu'on ne sait pas quoi faire à manger !

Un inconditionnel"}
{"text":"I was in there recently and I saw one of the people behind the counter connect their finger with their nose, in a sort of secretive way. Probably an automatic reflex for an itchy nose, but seriously? Gross. Not going back. I might not be able to go into any restaurant for a while. Ewww."}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis tout juste un mois, Trip de Bouffe (Mont-Royal) est à la fois une épicerie fine de produits libanais, et un comptoir lunch prêt-à-manger, à rapporter à la maison ou à déguster sur place, le tout pour un prix ridiculement bas.

On se bourre dans la pizza maison sur pain pita avec viande épicée, menthe, tomates et oignons, roulée en genre de wrap. Les kebbe et les rouleaux de fromages sont savoureux, les feuilles de vignes trop vinaigrées à mon goût."}
{"text":"Yum! It's a reasonably priced counter place with a few tables. The staff is super friendly and more than happy to walk you through the different options. Great place for a big meal, a small meal, a savoury or sweet snack, even a nibble. The kibbeh are my personal favourite ($1.25/each, with discount if you get half a dozen or a dozen). There are vegetarian and meat options. They'll heat food up for you if you're having it there."}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite Lebanese place in Montreal! This is coming from someone who is originally Lebanese and very picky!

Simply perfect! Food is so good and you can really taste how it's homemade!

I can't wait to go back! Reminds me of home :)"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty Libanese sandwiches, salads, warm dishes, baklava, etc. It's a great place to get a lunch to go (they have pre-packed items if you are in a rush, but it's not that long either for them to prepare you a sandwich).  I have always been able to find a place to sit down and eat there, even there are not that many tables. Staff is really nice. It's a spot that I visit on a regular basis, just about every week, and they always have a decent number of customers, which is a good sign, too!"}
{"text":"Tout ce que j'ai dévoré la était super bon, spécialement les petites pizza.  La pâte est addictive et tout simplement delicieuse c'est comme un melange entre un pita et un pain naan!!"}
{"text":"L-O-V-E. I need an option with more than five stars, please!

First of all, I was immediately struck by Richie's penetrating blue eyeballs. He has all the girls swooning, I am SURE.  Anyway, all lusting aside, this place was an awesome discovery. Located in the heart of the Plateau, TDB offers an awesome array of all things Lebanese, made fresh daily, with what appears to be a lot of love, by a dude called Pops (who is literally, Pops to one of the owners). They have a variety of pre-made items such as marinated turnip (squeal!), important goodies, nuts & spices, and of course, the main attraction: home cooked Lebanese food ranging from humus and chicken to falafel and Lebanese-style pizza (I forget what that's called). The food is delicious. Enough said. 

They do have a small section if you're in the mood to eat in, but I think it's more of a pick up and go kind of place. As well, if you're having a party and feel too lazy to cook - go see these guys and they'll hook you up. 

Noms."}
{"text":"As a middle eastern- I love the food here. Get home made Hummus, Kebbeh, stuffed vine leaves, and Labaneh cheese with Zaatar. Have some cold Malhabi for desert. It's fresh, healthy and tasty. A bit too expensive for what it is. It's great for a quick healthy meal on the way or getting some food home to share with friends. 
Tip: try a dish you are not familliar with, the friendly staff would love to help"}
{"text":"Loved the checkh el mehche. The eggplant was so soft and juicy, and still in a good shape. It goes really well with rice. The feuillete aux epinards was also really good, but lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion. I like how all the meal is balanced with mainly vegetables and small amount of meat (or not at all for some vege options). The food tastes like healthy home made food, not greasy at all.

The small snacks were a bit disappointing. The falafel was too salty...it felt like I bite into a ball of of spices. The cheese sticks and the chicken sticks are the best. The small pizzas were alright. By the way, there is no tax if you buy in dozen and you can mix all the snacks! :)

The staffs were friendly and the place seemed really cozy, almost like you walked in someone's home. There was even a video projected into the white wall, which was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just feel like a hot home-cooked meal. But there is nothing in the fridge or you really can't be stuffed cooking. This would be the moment where you leg it down to Trip de Bouffe. They are serving up hot, ready-to-devour home-cooked meals, as well as salads, sweets, coffee, bread; anything you could ever want really. They also sell refrigerated dishes and salads so if you premeditate getting into the same snitch again you can always grab one of those on your way out to put in the freezer. 
I wish Trip was a bit closer to my apartment though, it's delicious and inexpensive which makes it a place I could easily wind up at every other day."}
{"text":"Ce fût une agréable visite à ce nouveau \"restaurant\" sur le plateau. Je dis restaurant, mais on peut plus parler de comptoir alimentaire. Il y a des tables où vous pourrez écouter un film projeté sur le mur, mais la raison principale de l'établissement est plus le take-out. 

Très bon choix de pains. Ce sont des pains/pizzas libanais avec plusieurs choix de garnitures (végé, fromage, épinards/feta, viande) qui coûtent vraiment pas chers, mais qui sont très bons. 
Bon choix de salades aussi qui peuvent servir d'accompagnements.

Bien content de ma visite."}
{"text":"J'aime tellement cette petite place! Il est possible de manger sur place des plats cuisinés libanais vraiment pas chers et super goûteux, en plus de lahmajoun (pizzas arméniennes) roulés et garnis de légumes. Ils vendent toute sorte de salades, tartinades et condiments, comme du hummus, du taboulé, des falafels, des kebbés (bouchées à la viande), du labneh, et j'en passe. Mention toute spéciale aux attayef, ces petites crêpes farcies d'une crème avec des pistaches, à tremper dans du sirop. C'est juste malade! Chaque fois que j'y vais, j'en ressors avec des provisions pour plusieurs semaines. Je voudrais tout acheter! Il y a quelques petites tables, mais c'est plutôt un comptoir pour emporter."}
{"text":"Being middle eastern myself I have to say this is top notch Arabic food. It feels as if my own grandmother spent all day slaving in the kitchen whenever I eat here. The grape leaves are incredible, especially the vege ones and the kibbeh is scrumptious. I always get their spreads, the mhamara is my personal favourite. 

The staff, no matter who it is, is always so sweet and hard working. The decor is awesome with hints of Lebanese originals. 

I truly love this place, it is perfect and I will continue to come here again and again.

{"text":"Great little spot. Finally a little takeout Lebanese place in the Plateau. Everything I've had so far was great."}
{"text":"This is the place of choice for my partner, to get his fix when he's feeling homesick for Cyprus or Lebanon - that should tell you how authentically delicious Trip de Bouffe is for middle eastern fare. 
They have a MASSIVE selection of traditional dishes (eat-in or take-away) and each is as wholesomely good as the next. His only complaint? That they make their kefta with ground beef instead of lamb. I'm not complaining though! 
There are so many tantalizing options that you'll have to visit multiple times just to take it all in, and they are worth the return visits. This weekend, we'll be catering his birthday party with a wide selection of their $1/each snack-sized treats: all manner of pastry bites, sweet and savoury. Yum! 
The décor here is awesome, with funky handmade chandeliers constructed with colanders (?!) and an odd and amusing selection of old world embroideries and wild animal photos. There are some shelves stocked with choice pre-packaged food stuffs, too, if you feel like making your own inspired nomnoms at home. 
And, final word: friendly, great service every time! Maybe I get street cred because my manfriend knows the skinny on all the foods, or maybe they're just awesome!"}
{"text":"Whew! Dope ass place in the plateau for quick bites and full meals. It's incredibly cheap for the quality, taste, and amount you're getting plus you can add on more based on your level of hunger. The decor is all very quirky with a old school doctor's scale in the bathroom and the light up neon sign behind the counter that says \"le trip\". It has a definite quirky yet familiar ambience with the silent film being projected on the wall as well. I like the spicy chicken sandwich (essentially a rolled up pizza pita style) and mini pizzas in particular and would recommend them to anyone who wants to visit!"}
{"text":"Can I get a real quick AMEN for places that offer delicious food at extremely cheap prices + cozy vibes just for added measure? Trip de Bouffe offers all of these things, and it was like I took a step into Food Paradise when I walked in. I assume that whenever I see mountains of food around the corner and stocked on all of the shelves plus a decent amount of people in an establishment that it must be pretty good, right? So I decided to sample 6 different offerings (and forgo paying tax!) by getting two of each of the grape leaves, kibbeh, cheese rolls, and za'atar manaeesh and one meat and one veggie sambousek. All of this plus a coke came to 11.50 CAD, and after a quick heating of everything that was intended to be served hot, I dug in immediately.

The grape leaves had a perfect balance of acidity and refreshing coolness as well as the savory texture of the rice. The kibbeh were basically balls of meaty goodness (that just sounded really gross but I don't know any other way to describe it) that are accentuated with doses of spice and onion without being overkill. Moving on to the cheese rolls, they were basically ooey, gooey, cheesy goodness stuffed in a little wrapping, but they didn't taste too greasy which was a pleasant surprise. The za'atar manaeesh tasted quite good for what seemed like simple mini flatbreads, and the sambouseks were each their own little pockets of flaky heaven combined with various fillings. After finishing everything, I almost didn't want to leave and just wanted to order more food, but alas, I have daily budget constraints I must abide by...

I will definitely be coming back to Trip de Bouffe to sample their more filling hot dishes, as I've heard good things about the catfish in particular! Otherwise, come here if you really want to experience a wide variety of Lebanese food, which is arguably one of, if not the best Middle Eastern cuisines in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Pita made in house - perfect. All salads sampled so far - tasty and beyond fresh. Stuffed vine leaves - in the top 5 ever tasted according to my partner.  All stuffed pastries sampled so far amazing! 
Ah nuts! I have made myself so hungry for these amazing goodies that I have to cut this review short to go out and get some more.
So, briefly, pick up your goodies there for your picnic on the mountain or to nosh at home in the depth of winter to remind you of warm Mediterranean breezes.
Also, the guys really know their stuff, ask them about their dishes - they're so knowledgeable and friendly it's an added treat. 
Off I go! (Did I bring enough bags to carry it all home?)"}
{"text":"Endroit parfait pour acheter des sauces à tremper ou à tartiner pour des apéro dinatoires. La meilleure testée à ce jour est aux épinards, un régal!
Pas encore testé les autres plats cuisinés mais tout ce qui est présenté au comptoir donne très envie."}
{"text":"C'est pas frais , et c'est très cher. c'est pas une belle expérience pour moi. Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant  à  personne."}
{"text":"Hungry and anywhere near avenue Mont-Royal? Drop by here for a quick bite or a full meal, you won't leave disappointed. They have so many options of manoushes, all on house-made chewy flatbread. You pick the base type, and can then choose if you want to get it \"all dressed\" for and extra dollar fifty. It's then (painfully slowly) heated and rolled up, to be eaten like a pita wrap. It's the best, freshest tasting wrap we've ever had. Paul always gets the all dressed spicy chicken and I've tried the kechk (tomato, yogurt, sesame), the veggie, and the za'atar-cheese, all good. I ordered kechk thinking it was going to be strong and interesting tasting, but honestly it was pretty subdued.
If you super love them, you can buy packs of 6 (8?) in the fridge to bring home!

They also have a fantastic salad bar, and excellent hot meals

Don't forget to grab a manoushe pin on the way out!"}
{"text":"As I'm walking on st denis hungry :) I saw trip de bouf on the other side of the street it's said Boulangerie  libanaise. As soon as I came in in was taking by a beautiful smell that reminded of home, I knew this  was going to be an epic food experience and it was.
They don't play around here :) it's legit."}
{"text":"My friend bought an assortment of goodies for the superbowl and now I cannot stop thinking about the awesomeness."}
{"text":"So happy to have discovered this place! Middle eastern food lovers rejoice, this is as good as it gets. So many manoush options, sandwiches, salads and desserts. You can eat on site or get takeout and the staff is super friendly. Everything looks so fresh and delicious. Lots of love for this little shop!"}
{"text":"Super bon libanais à emporter. Tout à l'air délicieux... et tout l'est ! Il y a tellement de choix que je teste quelque chose de différent à chaque fois et je n'ai pour le moment jamais été déçu. Le service est adorable et compétent. Une cantine pour moi qui travaille dans le quartier."}
{"text":"I am an expert at Lebanese food (not at modesty though) and I have to say that I really liked this place. Maybe the second best lebanese food that I ever had in Montreal. However, it is not a restaurant so I would recommend it for take-out. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"What I like to do is buy a bag of pitas, some hummus, some quinoa salad, some pickled turnips, some labneh and some taboule, then just mix all that shit together in 5 sandwiches. Sometimes I get crazy and order the chicken and rice, and pop it in the mix. They also have amazing made to order sandwiches in the back if the former sounds like too much work."}
{"text":"Un petit ''marché Adonis'' sur le Plateau, comptoir de bouffe libanaise prêt-à-manger sur place ou pour emporter !"}
{"text":"If you don't mind hipster vibe, you should check this place out. They have lots of delicious Lebanese snacks that you can order to take away, it will definitely be few of the best snacks you can bring to a party."}
{"text":"When I stood in the shop and chose from the prepared dishes and salads presented behind the glass counter I was full of hope. We went for a filo bake with spinach and rice and a large bowl with three different salads. I expected oriental spices and intensive herbs but unfortunately the flavors weren't great at all. It's possible that Trip de Bouffe is great at other dishes but I'll probably not come again to risk it."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best food served on Mont Royal. The staff is very nice too which is always a plus. Love their meat lasagna, the spaghetti pasta and the salmon pie.  They also have these delicious mozzarella and beef sticks for snacks. The prices are great too."}
{"text":"You HAVE to try the regular chicken pizza with garlic sauce! I can't stop ordering it, it's just perfect. Don't add any vegetables for the full experience. The place is super cute and they have other amazing homemade dishes as well :)"}
