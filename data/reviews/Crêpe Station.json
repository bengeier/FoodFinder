{"text":"Food is awesome but word to the wise....Don't come in the morning because the service is horrible!  No \"Hello Welcome \" or \"Thank you for coming \". No smile NOTHING. But the crepes are good ."}
{"text":"I needed to treat myself after a long morning and this place is perfect for that. The best crepes in town. Just seeing them make my crepe with such fresh fruit makes me happy. I love this place"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get cheap and delicious crepes I have came here twice and have not been disappointed yet! It's super cute and cozy inside. The works are nice and friendly and super fast at getting your order done. If your looking for a fast and cheap place to relax with some friends I recommend crêpe station for sure!"}
{"text":"\"Oh my god. So good.\" Those were the words my daughter uttered after taking her first bite of the Nutella Crepe (1).  Very warm, lit, friendly and clean place."}
{"text":"The strawberries in my crepe were spoiled. Unacceptable! They should specify that the berries are not fresh. The plates are also very low quality. I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the staff should pay more attention to what they're doing. I ordered a crepe and a chai tea frappe. They charged me for two crepes when I had just asked for one. Then, they made the chai iced; and then I let them know I wanted a frappe. Then they made a Thai tea frappe. I was just done by then.... The staff seemed to be more focused on chit chatting, than paying attention to the orders they had."}
{"text":"The guys taking the orders are nice, but one of the ladies had a very bad attitude even after my order was fucked up and the fruit wasn't fresh. The crepe overall was okay. The lady needs to change her attitude"}
{"text":"This is a great place for crepes, the seating is not great but the food is excellent. the staff is friendly and is knowledgeable to help you order. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cajeta Crepe with strawberries & bananas, the crepe was big and delicious, the fruit was good but they needed to add a lot more Cajeta  They only drizzled it on the top.  Staff was patient and friendly, location was easy to find. Over all a good experience, I'll be back to try something different"}
{"text":"The crepes here are very yummy. They stuff them full of fruit and it is a very competitive price.  I liked the variety of fruit that they had and the toppings were awesome! The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because they were very slow on the service part. Once I was able get my order in, the crepe was fast but to order it took about 10-15 minutes because both people were working on the crepes and no one was taking orders."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and beyond expectation. I didn't know what I was anticipating, going in, as I wasn't familiar with the restaurant, and it was late in the evening. Despite them being busy, my order was made quickly, and I was on my way. The crepes were affordable, and of excellent quality.  The Chicken Pesto Crepe was full of flavor, not salt. It's easy to over-season chicken and Pesto both, and Crepe Station doesn't do that. Extremely flavorful without being a sodium bomb, I was only saddened when I realized that I'd already eaten it all. As someone who is fairly picky about my pesto, I was satisfied with it. It also came with a mango and strawberry salad, with provided a fine sweet accompaniment.  The strawberry crepe, with cream cheese, was completely packed with strawberries. Inside, on top, underneath... every bite was filed to the brim with strawberry. the consistency of the crepe held up well to the filling, and i was one of the best strawberry crepes I've ever had, easily.  This will quickly become one of my regular weekend meals, without a doubt. For a random stop, this was well worth it. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent!!! The food, sadly, isn't the best. Out of all the fruit toppings that you can add to your crepe, more than half are canned and not fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious crêpes. The fruit is freshly cut. The portion size is pretty reasonable. For around $23 we got 1 crêpe, 2 panini (comes with chips) and 2 sodas."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday was treated by both workers with a horrible attitude made me feel like I did something wrong ... A store does not treat paying customers with great service has no chance on surviving for long, You can have the best CREPES in vegas but when you have workers treating you down and making the atmosphere very hard to be in then you have no chance to get repeat customers ... Also no real whipped cream !!! Crepe itself is bland but STUFFED  with a lot of fruit A LOT.   Customer Service --0 STARS FOOD-- 2.5 STARS   OVERALL i do NOT recommend this place to ANYONE that likes to be treated with decency !!  Horrible horrible customer service made me get home with a terrible terrible mood just by walking in and buying crepes."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Everything is so good and fresh. The staff is super friendly and the service rocks!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem! The crepes are to die for! They are packed with fruit and the toppings of your choice. My favorite is a cream cheese crepe with strawberries, mangoes, and caramel drizzled on top. The portions are very generous. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Overall it's a warm environment that will make you feel at home, like part of the family! I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"1st time here and will definitely be returning. I had a lechera crepe topped with strawberries and sweet peaches along with a caramel machiatto. Thumbs up to both! A great balance of flavors without overwhelmingly sweet. The machiatto was better than Starbucks! And the prices/portion were perfect for a Sunday afternoon. Great, friendly atmosphere to add. All in all, nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"It's simply amazing  Además es atendido por latinos y el servicio y porciones son increíbles"}
{"text":"No dan  correctamente las órdenes y cuando les dices unas mujer muy grosera me atendió 2 veces en las diferentes locaciones me trató mal pésimo lugar"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected surprise. We were in Vegas for a day of business and we're near there. Looked up a breakfast place with Crêpe and this came up. It did not look much from outside or in but boy was the food great. Service was even better. We had bacon and ham Crêpe with latte that came beautifully designed. After we ate all we thought of pictures we could have taken. If only we stayed another day, for sure next trip"}
{"text":"Awesome place, very good service, the food is delicious and they also have a TV to watch sports."}
{"text":"since  i  traveled  to   paris  last    year    and  i  tested  the    crepes     for  first  time  there  i    webt  to  this   place   got   a   breakfast  crepe  (  was   regular  nothing      awesome)     got  a   cappuccino (   flavorless ,    you  get  better  one  in   the  gas   station  )   got  a  salad  (    was    so  good    the   better  )    couple  things  that  i  dont  like  about  this  place   ,  give  you  the   foot  in a   red  plastic  tray ,   the  crepe  in a     chep   plastic plate   with    pastic    fork  ,  (  this   make  this  place  chip  )    i   will   give  other  chance  this  place  in  the   future  ,"}
{"text":"Crepes here are super delicious! Fruit it fresh and their order online option is great. The place is always busy and there's not a lot of room, but definitely worth the wait and you can always get it to go too."}
{"text":"Really yummy!! Had the macaroons, ice cream and cheesecake...,but will definitely come back for the crepes!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this spot for the last month and every time I do I say to myself you need to go try that place. I finally did, and it was delicious. The menu was easy to figure out and had just enough options to choose from. I got the cream cheese with strawberries and whipped cream, with a vanilla latte. They are only open 9am-11am Monday-Sunday but if you can find time during those hours to make it over and get a crêpe, I promise you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I love the Nutella crepe. They give you so much fruit on your crepe order. I love the customer service the employees always remember what I always order. The crepe mix is so delicious and rich. Great atmosphere and h"}
{"text":"The Crepes are good but the fruit has been previously frozen. One of my strawberries was frozen when I bit into it. The mangos are old and runny which was disappointing because I love fresh mangos. I'd go back but I'd avoid the fruit. Great service though."}
{"text":"Ok I don't know if they charge for additional sauce on your crepe this was the first time I've been asking for additional sauce on top of my crepe with no extra charger and now suddenly they are charging which is cool but another customer asked for Nutella sauce and didn't charge her like really?? I end up not paying for the sauce coz I didn't have cash but anyway..."}
{"text":"I'm not a into sweet desserts however these crepes are beyond delicious. I love the Nutella one with strawberry and banana. So delicious! They even had enough strawberries. It's worth the price. You get what you paid for. They even add extra whip cream with no extra cost. I truly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Such a delicious place. Got the lechera crepe, it was amazing.  They can make the sweetness of your crepe as much or as less sweet as you want. Definitely will be back when I am in town next time."}
{"text":"Crepe Station finally has a brick and mortar location! Menu includes coffee drinks and paninis, but the highlight is the namesake crepes, available in sweet and savory varieties. The open kitchen space is a huge plus, as you can see your crepe being made.  CHICKEN PESTO PANINI: Buttery bread and a variety of fresh fillings, but still oddly on the plain side. I'd suggest a different pesto that has more pop to it. Sided with your choice of chips or a salad (my choice), which came topped with chopped fruit and balsamic. Not my preference, but not bad. NUTELLA CREPE: Huge crepe, tons of Nutella, topped with your choice of two chopped fruits (strawberry and mango being mine). Generous portion for the low price, made fresh, and oozing with hazelnut spread. I'd try a savory version next time. CARAMEL FRAPPE: At $3, this is the best price I've found for a standard blended coffee beverage and I'd prefer to frequent this spot than the 'Bucks across the street.   Service is all smiles, location is clean, and they have great hours: 8AM-11PM daily. Their small menu allows their skills as crepe artists to shine, but I'll have to try a different Panini next time.  EDIT: Dropping a star from my rating. Toppings/fillings inconsistent, seem to be declining in quality. If you're wanting crepes in this area, it'll do, but there are better options in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here a couple times a month. To all the losers out there who keep saying \"horrible customer service, they don't speak English\" just stfu THEY TRY. It's not perfect English, this is not a fancy restaurant, go get your overpriced and bland POS on the strip.  This place is a small mom/pop shop that started out in their house to now a full on business. I'm super proud & inspired by their history and success."}
{"text":"Its such cute cafe.  I visited them a couple of months ago. I had one of their mozzarella cheese sandwiches (5/5) and Nutella crape (5/5). I love the fact that their fruit compote is made in-house. The crape has the perfect ratio of Nutella and fruit.  The cafe was clean and the staff made it sure it stayed that way during a busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I thought the quality of the food was rather poor.  From the coffee beverages that didn't taste like coffee to the equally odd-tasting crepe (took three bites, threw it away), to the uneventful club sandwich to the lackluster, watery milkshakes... quite disappointed. We did like the chicken pesto sandwich fine enough, though.    The positives are that they got the order correct and service was quick.  But that's not going to bring us back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is ok.   But getting ridiculous expensive.   Las gentes son más miserables se pilliscan las uñas y te cobran hasta por un gota de todo.  Breakfast little sandwich 8$. Came here a couple of times but def not coming back"}
{"text":"I was craving some crepes and wanted to try somewhere new so we decided to give this place a try. My boyfriend and I ordered the Nutella and red velvet crepes, and whew, they were huge! I couldn't believe we only paid $12 for 2 crepes with lots of toppings. They have fresh fruits like strawberries, bananas, pineapples, mangoes, etc. Definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Local place with regulars. Amazing coffees and crepes.  Best I have had.  Way better than strip stuff. Had banana Nutella and breakfast crepe. Both great.  Friendly staff that care."}
{"text":"A breakfast spot that doesn't open until 0930 is almost useless. A breakfast place in Vegas that doesn't open until 930.... Completely useless. We have now tried to go to this place twice and they weren't open for over 2 hours. We work nights so we count on places opening at a reasonable time.  0930 is way to late for any breakfast place to open."}
{"text":"I love these crepes, but I've had two bad experiences now.  it's been two times now that they mess up my order. The first time I didn't say anything because regardless it was still delicious. Now the last time I came here, I ordered 4 crepes for four people. My crepe was the ONLY ONE with cream cheese. They messed it up and put the wrong filling. This time I actually went and brought it to their attention with my receipt. The guy rudely says \"I did give you the right one, but I'll give you another one anyway\" almost as if he indirectly called me a liar. He didn't even want to see my receipt. Stupid guy."}
{"text":"decent prices for smoothies and lattes! Came here randomly and bought a lechera crepe which was so delicious for less than $6. I highly recommend you coming in to try cheesecake and or ice cream. They also have free water which is good because after consuming lots of sugar your mouth feels ready to explode."}
{"text":"These crêpes are pretty tasty. We ordered the savory chicken pesto ($7), the sweet cheese cake with mango and strawberries ($7), and the sweet cream cheese with berries and nutella on top ($6). The savory crepe came with a side salad.  All three crêpes were filled full. The side salad lettuce, strawberries, mango, and an Italian dressing. The flavors were tasty. And the value was pretty good at $6 and $7.   Although the menu is pretty simple and not very lengthy, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Mmmm chicken pesto panini is so delicious!! We also tried a breakfast crepe and was super delicious with a very generous portion. Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I freakin LOVE crepes and am picky as shit about them!! This place is a total hole in the wall in a shit, ghetto location on Charleston. But you know what they say, never judge a book by it's cover, sometimes you judge right, sometimes you judge wrong. But my friend and I took a chance, and can honestly say we were very wrong. This place although sketchy on the outside provided me with not only one of the most DELICIOUS crepes I have EVER had in my life, but also an extremely friendly staff, super clean, super sanitary (they cook the crepes right in front of you), clean bathroom, EVERYTHING was fresh as in there wasn't ONE mushy strawberry in my crepe, and the side salad was perfect.  And the coffee was excellent. SUCH a pleasant surprise and I wish I had found this place sooner in the 8 years I have lived here. I will definitely be returning. Family owned and operated and everyone was so sweet!! So pleasantly surprised and they are open late as well for those late night crepe cravings. Very impressed and will definitely continue to support this place!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with crepes had no flavor very plain no taste.The only thing I liked was the fruit. I was really excited to go but I will not going back ."}
{"text":"Great food! This place was quaint and really hits home. No, I mean seriously! I don't know if it's because I have em a buck or what but they were genuinely friendly and the food was fresh and obviously of quality. Great little place if you are in the area! I was feeling savory so I got a panini!  Can't wait to go back and try all the different crepes! Stay tuned! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome .  Crêpes were delicious. Highly recommend!!  Prices are good for the amount of food you get. A sanitation grade. A winner."}
{"text":"We had a breakfast crepe....veggie panini and a dessert crepe. ALL WERE DELICIOUS.   We almost gave 4 stars due to the strip shopping center /fast food ambience....but ...   we watched the crepes made fresh.  Prices are very reasonable.   I have to give them 5 stars.  Good luck to this small business.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG. This place is amazing.. They pack soo much fruit in there deliciously creative crepes. Its a wonder they can keep it so compact. Check it out"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good breakfast spot.The coffee and the food was great.My mom and my daughters food was really good too they both liked what they had and they ate pretty much everything. One had the kids waffle which I thought she was going to get two waffles but she only got one I went by the picture on the menu they had on the counter and it was served with strawberry's.My other daughter got a bacon bagel and egg and juice and she said it was great and tasty and good size. Me and my mom had a Veggie and a tuna panini with coffee and a side salad.The salad I liked it so much it had mango with I believe with Italian dressing not sure but it was really edible.The lady that took our order wasn't so Pleasant and she did answer our question and helped but maybe she wasn't having a great morning.But other then that everything was great we enjoyed our food and coffee.   Este fue un buen lugar para el desayuno.El café y la comida era estupenda.Mi madre y mi comida de las hijas era muy bueno también les gustaba lo que tenían y comieron prácticamente todo. Uno tenía los niños gofres que me pareció que iba a conseguir dos gofres pero ella sólo nos dieron una me fui por la imagen en el menú que tenían en el mostrador y se sirve con Strawberry's.Mi otra hija nos dieron un bagel de tocino y huevo y zumo y dijo que era genial y sabroso y buen tamaño. Mi madre y yo tuvimos una Veggie y un atún panini con café y una ensalada de lado.La ensalada me gustó tanto que tenía mango con creo que con vestidor italiano no estoy seguro, pero era muy comestible.La señora que tomó nuestra orden wasn ' t tan agradable y ella no responder a nuestra pregunta y nos ayudó pero quizás ella no estaba teniendo una gran mañana. Pero otro entonces que todo era genial, disfrutamos de nuestra comida y café."}
{"text":"This is locally own business with family atmosphere. Staff is super friendly. We ordered the red velvet with bananas and strawberries, comes with whipped cream and Lechera (condensed milk) toppings. Good portion for $6. They also make fresh fruit smoothies. Found out about the place through friends. They said this business started in home then upgraded to a shop."}
{"text":"Wow! These crepes. Just wow! I highly recommend venturing off the strip to stop by the Crepe Station -- your taste buds will be jumping for joy and you will leave happy.   This little shop is the real deal! You walk in, go up to the counter, and have to make some difficult decisions... What kind of crepe you want -- sweet or savory -- then what kind of fillings you want. (They also have items other than crepes, if you don't like crepes, but what kind of person doesn't like crepes?!)   My best friend and I wanted the best of both worlds -- sweet and savory -- so we ordered one of each and split them both. For the sweet one, we ordered Nutella with strawberries and bananas, topped off with whip cream. So delish (see photo). For the savory one, we ordered the Veggie Crepe. The Veggie one was okay... Kinda tripped me out 'cause I'm accustomed to crepes being sweet, so what I was tasting and what my brain thought of didn't match up and made it a little weird. It was good though, definitely not complaining.   Be prepared to wait a bit to get your crepe though, each one is made-to-order, and carefully prepared to your liking... and you can't rush perfection!"}
{"text":"Where to begin with this place...I literally go EVERY week with my WiFEy...((YES! its THAT good)) We tend to go on Wednesdays & we always order the crepe's. I've also tried the panini's. These girls do an amazing job when it comes to the crepe, we always order the Nutella with strawberry & banana & a side of chocolate ice cream. It is well worth the price of I believe $7. The crepe's are a decent size, they give you so much fruit & the ice cream is so rich & creamy. I absolutely love this place. I mean, i wouldn't go EVERY week if i didn't right? =) Anyways, the service is quick & they are very friendly. They have a good variety of fruits & flavors to choose from. They are very popular because when we go its always somewhat if not packed. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good crepe place. They also have this cool area were you can watch them making your crepe, its pretty dope. It's a nice little cozy place. I will continue to go every week for my weekly doze of Crepe =)"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to go back! I had a salad and my bf got a Nutella crepe, we weren't disappointed. We enjoyed it and still keep saying we need to try more on their menu."}
{"text":"Crepe is very delicious with a good amount of fruit inside & out, side of ice cream was only $1 :) super cheap && very friendly humble staff...! Good job guys :D"}
{"text":"Best crepes everrrr!!! The red velvet with cheese cake is amazingAnd I drove all the way from Henderson just tome here!!!!highly recommend them!!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas for a few days so I wanted to visit some local gems. This hit the spot! I got the Nutella crepe with double strawberries and it was EXCELLENT! It was a little packed when we got there but we were able to get a seat by the time we were done ordering. The staff was also very nice! My boyfriend got a savory crepe (with salami) that I failed to take a pic of but it was also good"}
{"text":"Great great great. Big portions and good too. A piece of Europe (kinda) in Vegas. Also 2$ latte (better than starbuc$$). Come here! Lol. Seriously worth a stop."}
{"text":"This is a good, off the strip spot for crepes. There are other places too that might be sliiiightly better than this one but this place is acceptable and I would come back again. First thing I noticed was that this place looked like an old Subway or sandwich place, then you notice that their wallpaper is DEFINITELY old Quizno's paper. Not a big deal but it's pretty funny. I ordered the breakfast croissant with bacon and it was perfect. The croissant was soft and flaky and the egg, cheese, and bacon were really good. I asked for the bacon well done to make sure it was crispy. You can order a side of fruit for $1 extra."}
{"text":"We found this place though yelp. I ordered an apple pie crepe, and a cheesecake crepe with fresh fruit and Nutella. I really wanted coffee but I also wanted a milkshake. I asked them if they could make me one even though it wasn't on the menu and they did :) I was one happy camper. Milkshake with shots of espresso blended in is the best. The crepes were so good and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was amazing.   Location is a little sketchy but the crepes were delicious.  Trying to add some pictures"}
{"text":"First time in this place. Food is fresh and really Really delicious.  I didn't know what to order.The guy with glasses explain so well. Thank you so much :) Plus they keep the place neat and clean. My expriance with Crepe Station is very satisfied."}
{"text":"Really good crepes! Excellent service! Everyone is friendly and outgoing, they seem to have a high priority on good food quality and taste!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I had the gluten free breakfast crepe and a sweet crepe with mango and strawberries. The ingredients were fresh and not overly sweetened (which is a common flaw of most crepe eareries)."}
{"text":"Wow, huge crepes FILLED with fruit! And they add two more scoops of it on top!! Crepes come in different flavors, many Mexican inspired. You get to choose two fruits but can add more and can even add ice cream for an additional charge. The Nutella one is very popular but we tried the Lechera since I love condensed milk but have never tried it on a crepe. It's soooo good- so sweet and milky. The creaminess pairs perfectly with the fruit!  Menu is pretty extensive. Create your own sweet combo with different toppings! They've got savory crepes too, which I'm curious to try. Paninis and salads offered as well.  Overall a pretty good crepe (just a bit over cooked- more browned and chewy). Perfect for sharing, and I'll definitely be back to try more flavors."}
{"text":"The parking lot is not well lit. It's sketchy as fuck. The inside of the place is super hot, ac not functioning. People behind the counter super nice. It gets loud inside very quickly and super uncomfortable. Atmosphere is a big turn off. Will not return."}
{"text":"If you looking for a place to eat real crepes this is the place to go. I make crepes myself since i was 16 years old and known for it as the best crepe maker so you can imagine how picky I can be ones it comes to taste someone else making them. At Crêpe Station I can tell the chefs really care for the recipe and put real milk real eggs what does make big difference for the taste. Thank you Chris we will be back."}
{"text":"New crepe place, very good and very well priced! The establishment is clean, the staff is very friendly and the crepes are tasty."}
{"text":"This place crepe was okay I've actually had better crepes but they were nice. I think they should either focus more on crepes or sandwiches because it seems like too much going on at once. I go here because its close to where I live."}
{"text":"First time here and was a very friendly environment. They gave us all the time I needed to order and helped me by answering any question I had. Also it was also very clean environment!   (I order a cheesecake crepe with bananas and strawberries with the topping sauce of cajeta)"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out after passing by it for thr past 2 years.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Food is reasonably price.  Crepes are perfect.  I had the regular crepe with cheese cake filling with fresh strawberries and bananas topped with nutella! Delish... my attendant was very nice as well.  This is why I try to support the smaller businesses; money well spent."}
{"text":"Nothing overly exciting. I had the caramel frappe and the chicken pesto crepe. The chicken seemed like it came from a package and the pesto was not very flavorful. I would be willing to give it another chance because the sweet crepes looked delicious and the staff was very nice. Just not a place I would go back for lunch...unless I had a sweet tooth. :)"}
{"text":"Very good crepes however I ordered a cream cheese crepe and the young lady forgot to put cream cheese in. I go up with the crepe showing her the is absolutely no cream cheese and she says but I put two scoops in. I ask her to show me a trace of it as I can not see nor taste any. Her reply is but I put it in. I'm happy that she offered to remake it though. We cannot alway make things to perfection but I appreciate them correcting the issue!"}
{"text":"We just went there . Def looks like a family business , thats why they take care of every single detail . I got a red velvet crepe and a capuccino . Better than ones from the strip . Good price and better quality . Def i'll be back ."}
{"text":"Yummy crepes and shakes!! Had the Cinnamon apple crepe and the lechera gluten free crepe with bananas and whip cream. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, friendly. The chicken pesto panini and Nutella sweet crepe we had were fantastic.  Happy family vibe which was awesome."}
{"text":"Best coffee and Crepes! Awesome Place for super affordable prices!! Will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"We got here just before closing and they were out of panini's and other items. It was just crepes only - so this review is for our crepes and my white mocha. We ordered the banana/nutella crepe with whipped cream and the pesto chicken crepe. Both of them were a welcome treat for a late night dinner/ snack/ dessert. I'm glad we took them to the room and enjoyed them there. I would definitely go back here during the day and try some more items. I don't remember the 2 staff members who helped us but the guy was helpful with our questions. He accidentally made the wrong size white mocha but made things right by making me another small. I appreciate that. This is a cute little restaurant that shouldn't be overlooked. Lots of goodies to eat in here - I want one of those macaroons - they looked tasty!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try their famous crêpes after seeing them on Facebook for so long.  I am happy that now they have their establishment.  I had their cheesecake crêpe and it was delicious.  I went in with a large party and took up most of the place.  They were very nice and attentive to all of us.  Great customer service, great food.  Will be back soon to try their savory crêpes and their paninis."}
{"text":"had a mixed berry an peach crepe with sweetened condensed milk. Excellent well priced, fast nice staff. Great choice."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday after I had been craving crepes for a while and this place did not disappoint. It's located next to small shops so it can be overlooked. I ordered the salami crepe which had salami, cheese, pesto, spinach and tomato. It was excellent. It came with either chips or salad. I chose the salad which also came with some strawberries and mango which I was not expecting. I definitely can't wait to come back to try their sweet crepes."}
{"text":"What a ridiculous company they can't even speak English and communicate with their customers properly horrible service I would never recommend this place if you live in this country speak the native language"}
{"text":"Went here and my boyfriend got the apple cinnamon crepe , he said it was delicious . I got the chicken pesto panini and loved it !  The owner is a very nice guy ! I will absolutely be going here again !"}
{"text":"Great tasting crepes! Good to get away from the busy Strip and landed here based on Yelp reviews. The tomato basil soup goes really well with the panini."}
{"text":"This place was great! Super friendly and had gluten free options! And they make a bomb cappuccino!"}
{"text":"This is will probably be my lunch go-to place moving forward!  Granted location isn't the most desirable but can easily be overlooked.   My daughter had a Lechera crepe with strawberries. I had a tuna pesto panini (YUM) with a choice of salad or chips, of course I had to try their salad. To drink I got their Italian raspberry soda! which I loved ( wasn't too sweet). Price was average 19 dollars and some change for our order. Portions were small but filling.  Customer service was good! everyone was nice! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not much from the outside but oh boy, their food is out of this world! Crèpes filled to the max with fruits - the best I've had in a long time. Friendly staff with big smiles. A breath of fresh air. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is the friendliest and yummiest place in town. I can't believe how wonderful it is. And everything is amazingly delicious and looks like it belongs in a magazine. The presentation is terrific but their customer service is even better. I am a big big fan! Way to go!!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved it ! We went and everything we saw in that place was clean and the had great service and they were fast everything tasted delicious i recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, very rude and unprofessional. Crepes are average, panini's are actually pretty good. The customer service is terrible & the communication skills are even worse. Employees spoke in Spanish during the entire time"}
{"text":"Friendly efficient service, even though it was 10 minutes till closing time. Great options for both fruit/sweet crepes as well as savory options. I ordered the Nutella, to-go for my son with Bananas and Strawberries. For me, the savory vegetable crepe with fresh mozzarella and pesto to-go. Delicious!!! I can't wait to go back to try the Cinnamon Apple crepe with vanilla ice cream and one of their panini sandwiches. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"These aren't my mommas crapes but since she lives across country, I have to make do. Crepe Station has proven to be a worthy substitute. I've been here a few times and honestly like them better than other creperies I've been to around town. I come here for the sweet crepes, though they offer savory ones as well. Along with sandwiches, ice cream, macrons, breakfast options, and a variety of drinks.   Back to the sweet crepes.  What I really like about them is flavor in the crepe itself. What other places do, they stuff the crepe and seem to feel that the crepe itself does not need any added flavor or sweetness and it turns out tasting like you're chewing paper. Crepes here have a good consistency (thin and solid enough not to rip) and can taste good all by themselves. You also have an option between regular, wheat, gluten free, and RED VELVET! I really enjoyed the red velvet crepe stuffed with cheesecake, bananas, and mixed berries the last time I was here. It was topped with powdered sugar, nutella, mixed berries, and banana.... a scoop of icecream on the side... Too much? Nah, it was amazing! This type of desert is not something you have after a meal, it replaces the meal itself. Honestly, it's hard to feel guilty for having a year worth of sugar when your taste buds are in heaven. The location is tiny but clean. They have about 6 tables and I have yet to see this place empty. Between the affordable prices and delicious food, they seem to stay consistently busy."}
{"text":"Crepes, with a Mexican twist! The crepes here are as good as any of the fancy Strip eateries, freshly made to order in the customer's view. I ordered a Nutella crepe with banana and strawberry, served with whipped cream, a classic. They also have a menu of sandwiches and paninis; I recommend the roast beef panini. And what better than a strawberry milkshake to complete the calorie count?!! Only detractor: the TV was too loud!!"}
{"text":"Every time I walk in I am greeted by the friendly staff and their customer service is outstanding! Always quick in making my order every time I go in. They make a quality product, which I haven't had very good elsewhere. This is a place I always recommend to my friends and family. You can't beat the price either!"}
{"text":"This place is super bomb, loved their Nutella latte, most definitely a gotta try it! The place was very clean and service was quick the cashier was nice and they cook the crepe in front of you, will go back soon"}
{"text":"Best little hole in the wall in Vegas. If ur staying at a casino and are tired of paying $85 for a crouton make the trip. The food is amazing, be sure to get the cheesecake crepe.  Prices are low and parking is easy. Don't miss this spot, very refreshing place for Vegas madness."}
{"text":"First time here and this place and it was amazing. Everything is made fresh. Fruit is cut up fresh as well. Prices were not to bad. Also it was clean."}
{"text":"Love it! The crepe was nice and soft most of the other places that I go to are dry so I'm glad this one is completely different! I got mango and strawberry as my fruit and I got nuttela as the sauce and they even added a scoop of ice cream to it  definitely coming back for more. On top of that the music that they were playing were my favorite, I don't know if someone had the aux chord or what but I was jamming out while I ate my crepe ahah."}
{"text":"Both Yelp and the door say they open at 9am.  The girl opening up today did not arrive until 9:05 to open the door and then spent 10 minutes setting everything up before even acknowledging me in the store.  One customer left because she was not ready to start business for the day. When she was finally ready she was very short and rude acting like I was bothering here.  Another worker showed up around 9:10, never said a word just started helping her open. If you want repeat customers, employees should be ready and be a little more polite to customers.  As for the food, the coffee was good. A Carmel Macchiato.  I also ordered a veggie crepe which is just tomatoes, pesto, mozzarella and basil.  The crepe itself had no taste, if not for the inside it would have been bland.  I would rate the food 3 stars, and maybe even given an overall 4 stars if not for the lack of customer service and customer interaction.  Teaching moment:  things happen, if you are running behind, still greet the customer with a smile, have some fun with the fact you are running late and let the customer know it will be a minute.  That goes a long way versus acting like we are bothering you."}
{"text":"Beyond mad at the fact I just payed 6.50 for my sons kids meal that consisted of 2 eggo waffles and some strawberries, menu showed something completely different. Crepes were flavorless and dry. The only reason it's not getting 1 star is because it's was very clean."}
{"text":"The service is excellent!! The crêpes are delicious whether sweet or savory there is something to please anyone!  The coffee is strong and delicious! The prices aren't high, you can get a decent size meal for a really good price"}
{"text":"Thoughts of \"I guess?\", \"Eh (with a shoulder shrug)?\", and \"I just paid for that?\" come to mind when I think about the \"crepe\" I got here the other day.  This was a impulse buy as I was in the area doing other business. I recently had a good crepe experience at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace, so I was hoping to get a even better crepe at a dedicated crepe location. Riding the wave of nostalgia to recreate past experiences can leave you with regrettable purchases.  I ordered a standard crepe with bananas, nuts, nutella, and whipped cream. Did all of those ingredients end up on my plate in some form? Yes. But it was such a plain, basic, and uninspired crepe. The best way to describe it is if someone made a crepe at home following a basic recipe, and was trying to be cheap and frugal with the ingredients they bought at a grocery store.  The bananas were just peeled, cut and put into the crepe. The \"nuts\" came out of a resealable bag . When I say \"nuts\", the employee working there could not tell me which specific nut they were using since it was a chopped up medley of nuts, the kind you would find in snack isle of a gas station or at a grocery store. Nutella was drizzled on the crepe, nothing special (at this point, as I write this review, I am wondering if it even was nutella or just some generic chocolate hazelnut sauce, especially with what I saw next). Then they put \"whipped cream\" on top. Straight out of a aerosol can with \"non-dairy whipped cream\" printed on it.   It tasted as I expected it to from the previous ingredients mention and their respective quality. It was a very dull and regrettable experience, None of the ingredients were innovative or unique, none of them were transformed from their original state, and some of the items weren't even \"real\".  When the crepe station, at the dessert bar, at a buffet uses fresh and better ingredients to make a better crepe, (bananas foster/ caramel sauce covered bananas, candied almond granola chunks, real cream that had to be dolloped on to the crepes since it was in a metal bowl having actually been whipped at some point) the standalone crepe restaurant is doing something wrong. I wont be coming back, and I would not recommend their dessert crepes to anyone."}
{"text":"The Crepe Station was recommended to me by a friend recently. I treated my wife to a superb Crepe at this business. My wife ordered a breakfast Crepe and I had the cream cheese fresh strawberry and fresh blueberry Crepe. They were both very good. There are two locations here in Las Vegas. We visited the one on Charleston/Decatur. The business is small, clean with about six tables."}
{"text":"Finally a crepe place that you do not have to drive to and park on the Strip. Delicious and generous portions. Clean and friendly staff!  Looking forward to going back for another fabulous crepe!"}
{"text":"Breakfast crepe was lovely, had a sauce that I would buy a jar of if I could, staff were kind and informative."}
{"text":"It's been 11 days since this little restaurant opened up!  Fun fact, this place originated in the owner's home and locals would drive down to the house just to get their orders in!   This place offers a variety of batters from whole-wheat, to classic, to red velvet to sugar-free!   I tried both the red velvet crêpe and the classic crêpe.  The two crêpes were stuffed with strawberries and bananas.  To finish it off, they were topped with lechera (sweet condensed milk), powdered sugar and whipped cream.  The flavor of both batters was magnificent, but the crêpes were slightly chewy in comparison to traditional French crêpes.  The portions were rather large which was fantastic!  Overall I'd give them a 4 out of 5.  The Americano hot coffee I ordered was very bitter with a slightly burnt taste.  Not sure if it's the machine's fault or just a bad quality of beans.  I will definitely not be ordering this again and recommend passing on it when given the choice.  The Chicken Pesto Panini was nothing special.  The chicken was very tender and juicy so I must compliment the restaurant on that!  The bread was nicely toasted too!  The pesto sauce lacked a little seasoning which resulted in just a strong taste of plain basil.  The taste was a little too strong and ended up overpowering the panini instead of complimenting the ingredients.    If I had to rate this restaurant alone on its crêpes, which is their specialty it would definitely be 4 stars.  If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend trying it out if you're craving something sweet!  The staff is extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"Loved the crepes, and the service the first time I was here.  Second time I didn't realize didn't open til 9. Really? I thought breakfast would be the main Crepe time? Left, went Baby Stacks.  The next time waited out from for 15 min, no one ever showed up.  Today I could see them in there, but nine rolled around and no open doors. At about five after I just left.  I predict they'll be closed in six months.  Too many places that open early and on time. The two stars are for the first time, when the coffee guy was so nice, and the crepes were tasty."}
{"text":"Found thru Yelp and was looking for something different. While the outside and even inside seems a bit sketchy or a little bit of a turn off, the food was very good and definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and was excited to see of a place I've not heard about that was right around the corner from where we were and we were itching for a sweet snack.   I got a cheesecake crepe with mixed berries and banana drizzled with condensed milk. When it got to me I was surprised to find that the cheesecake element wasn't like spread, but they took a slice of store cheesecake and just put it in the middle. The mixed berries werent fresh mixed berries but a mixed compote of fruit cooked down to where I can't tell what berries it used to be. Whipped cream was canned and not fresh made.  I wasn't a fan of the crepe batter...it has a lot of bubbles which it shouldn't and was rather soft and a bit thick for a crepe. I ate it because I was hungry, but it didn't hit the spot.  Hubby got a condensed milk crepe. When asking what was the best combo of fruits together with that, the lady just read him the fruits they had and didn't answer the question. When he pressed another question about which fruit would be best with the peach, the answer was also a non answer. He ended up getting pineapple and peach. He's the sweet tooth and he would not eat his crepe. The fruits tasted off and paired with the crepe that was really soft, it was not a good combo. I tried it and the spoiled pineapple with canned peaches permeated the whole crepe as they just stuffed it full of fruit and had some on top too.  I dont know if I would try this place again. Either way, it's not my usual \"style\" of crepe as it was just stuffed with toppings that the crepe is more of a vehicle to hold everything, than the star. More is not always better, balance is key sometimes. I think I'm going to keep looking for a crepe place."}
{"text":"Great prices for a pretty good crepe! This place just opened not to long ago and I'm very impressed! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Crêpes here are that not amazing in my opinion. We got the chicken pesto crepe and did not like it. It just tasted like chicken and spinach. We got the Nutella crepe and it was overly sweet."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast crepe and it was delicious. It came with a breakfast salad which paired nicely with the crepe. There was some delicious sauce on top of a cheese/egg/bacon crepe. Was very pleased with the food. The decor is the only reason not 5 star. Its a little tired, feels like an old smoothie shop.  5star on the food."}
{"text":"I don't hate this place, I really enjoy coming here late nights. I'm just disappointed how the past few times my order has been wrong. When there's a language barrier between you & the cashier is one thing, but I had someone w/ me who spoke Spanish & on top of that pointing at the items I wanted straight from their pamphlet menu. I don't understand how my order was completely wrong? I will not give this place a one star cause it still tastes delicious, although I was not completely satisfied with my order. When what I wanted isn't what was on my plate"}
{"text":"Great late night spot if ever you have last minute craving. They have many crepe options, which i like. Crepes are a good size with alot of flavor and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"By far best crepes in Vegas, you may wonder why only 4 stars because it was my first time at their location  and I didn't know how heavily they add the sweetener to the crepes but overall it was great. I'm glad I did order an Americano coffee with nothing else added to it helped to keep the sweetness down.   Uno de las mejores crepas en Vegas, te podrás preguntar porque solo 4 estrellas pero solo fue porque era mi primera vez en este local y no sabia que agregaban en exceso para mi gusto el dulce al la crepa, pero e igual muy rico. Fue agradable acompañarlo con un café americano sin azúcar ayudo a pasar el dulce de la crepa."}
{"text":"Yes! Loved this place! First time here and the customer service was amazing. The blended coffee drinks were on point and very well priced. $4 for a large which would be at least $7 at other places. The crepes were very big and very generous with fillings. Great great place and will be definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've had better, but this is probably the closest crepe place near where I live and I don't see a reason to not be a returning guest.  When ordering sweet crepes, you get to choose a flavor and 2 fruits of your choice. They also give you an option for a different type of batter as well; red velvet, whole wheat (I think it was), and regular. Ice cream is an additional $1. I went with a regular Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana. The crepes are pretty huge and they fill it with whatever fruit you chose. And they definitely don't skimp out on the fruit too, so that's a plus.  I also ordered an iced Nutella latte, which I could've don't without lol.  The ladies behind the counter were really nice though. Super friendly and quick with their service."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. I had the cheesecake crepe with chocolate dressing and my wife had the lechera crepe with strawberries and banana and a mocha frappuccino.For everything it was like $17. Service is fast. The frappuccino was very tasty, tasted like Starbucks but with more of a coffee flavoring to it. The crepes were pretty delicious at first too.....but then the sugar overload hit. If you have a sweet tooth, this is the place for you!! They do have other \"savory\" crepes as well like the breakfast crepe which next time I come, will probably try that. Also have paninis, coffees, and smoothies."}
{"text":"Upon arriving too early for the indoor swap meet, I decided to try this place for breakfast. My daughter wanted something sweet so she went for the Nutella crepe with bananas. I ordered the ham and cheese crepe and a latte. They have an amazing selection of fresh fruit, and I loved watching my crepe being made. It reminded me of the dessert place at the Bellagio that has fresh crepes and chocolate. The prices are reasonable and the service is fast. We both ate every bit of our meals and  enjoyed every bite. I'll try it again the next time I'm in the neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"Great Crepes!!! I thought I was going to be disappointed by ordering one nutella crepe for $6 dollars but when I got my order, I was impressed. They stuffed the crepe with a big serving of fruit. Two fruit of your choice. I chose double strawberry and a scoop of ice cream, of... you guessed it, strawberry. It was delicious!!! I will be coming back every time I get a craving, but I'm afraid that's gonna every day. oh gosh....  Btw, saw some other stuff of the menu that looked yummy but my mind could only think and see sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Best crepes and value I've found in Las Vegas.  My favorite is banana and Nutella, which is a great combo.  It comes with a ton of bananas, and it's nice they don't skimp.  Stop in and enjoy desert.  Your wallet will appreciate it, and you mouth even more."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Kind of surprised me with the panini's and the breakfast sandwiches. They were pretty good. They had a huge selection of toppings you can have on their crepes which I liked but didn't know what to put on it. The tea wasn't good though. It had a horrible after taste so maybe I'll try one of their 4$ smoothies next time. I was pretty happy with the customer service and will be back to try other things. Saw a different review about someone predicting it to close in 6 months. I think it's just starting and maybe will be a good thing. It's not in the best of locations and isn't a big spot but maybe it can become something more :)    I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place has the best crapes in Las Vegas! Definitely they are works of art! You are going to want to come with an appetite because they give you bang for your buck. The place is small and cozy but they have plenty of excellent options that are to die for. Me and my family are hooked!they even have breakfast crapes for those that don't have a sweet tooth! Yum Yum! You must check it out at least once before you die."}
{"text":"My coworkers were talking about crepes, places to get crepes, and about a really popular crepe place that sold their crepes from their house and advertise through the Mexican \"Craigslist\" got popular and opened up a real brick & mortar store. Typical water cooler chitchat with our delivery truck driver when he stops in for order pick up.  That got me interested. At first they told me it was on E. Charleston. But I later found out after another coworker said it was closer to W. Charleston and Decatur. I was thinking how come I never heard about this place, I used to only lived a few streets away.  So after a mandated doctor's office visit about a mile or two away, I decided to give Crêpe Station a try. I nearly missed the small strip mall it was located on due to alerts that popped up on my phone, plus a lane was closed on Charleston due to who knows what. But with the slow moving traffic, I was able to turn into the plaza it was located in.  The place it turns out has only been opened about 2 weeks. But the owners did have several months to perfect their recipes & techniques while operating out of their underground home operation. Hundreds, if not thousands, of satisfied Mexicans can't be wrong :) And I am really glad to learn about this place through words of mouth networking.  Their menu is simple and organized logically. You have your sweet crêpes, your savory crêpes, paninis, beverages (coffees, smoothies). For first timers, ordering is not as stressful as trying to narrow down your option to just one from a 400+ items Chinese takeout menu.  I wanted to try their Red Velvet dessert crêpe, but ultimately picked the Chicken Pesto Crêpe (it was around noon and I have not have had lunch yet). The young kids behind the counter were nice and took the order and had it prepared and delivered it to my table after a nominal wait.  The included side salad looks better than most side salads you get at 95% of the restaurants out there. It has some sliced strawberries and mangos on top of mixed mesclun greens, with a light balsamic dressing. The Chicken Pesto Crêpe looks good, the presentation is nicely conceptualized & executed, the crepe was cooked just perfectly. I was happy with my selection and the price tag. Service was pleasant and efficient too.  Would I go back and try some more of their items from their simple menu?  Yes, of course. I'll be back. Probably next Thursday after another scheduled visit back to the medical specialist.    No, it's not a tomb-er!    (I hope you sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger in your head as you read that)."}
{"text":"Crepes are DELICIOUS Service is great! Been going there for almost a year. But this Friday I went in I ask for a cup of water and some lady there charge me more that ONE DOLLAR! For a small cup of water! And it was half way!! Ridiculous! Then I asked her to put more and she got mad. Not even at Starbucks I get charge for a trenta water. Business is business but they took it to a whole new level."}
