{"text":"This place is really well-priced and strikes a good balance between tasting good and doing things right!"}
{"text":"Last night we ordered chicken and wings from here, it was a big disappointment. I cannot imagine a place that specializes in chicken can dish out such badly fried dark soggy chicken. It was not only visually bad it tasted bad too. We also ordered 48 wings Honey garlic was ok. But buffallo wings was not up to the mark I ordered spicy  but it was not spicy it was full of vinegar. I was excited  about a Halal option in the neighborhood but unfortunately I have to fail this place."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday and am definitely a fan of this place - I love fried chicken and so am glad to have found a place that doesn't make me feel greasy and gross after my meal (KFC) and doesn't overcharge like crazy.   I had the popcorn chicken and LOVED it. It was really crispy and the crust didn't slide off like it does in a lot of other fried chicken places (I cannot stand slimy crust). I also had wedges and tried some of the onion rings my friend had ordered and they were both delicious, seriously - get yourself some onion rings.The food wasn't too oily like other places which is great! Everyone I was with loved it.  I'm also super glad this place is halal, so it's accessible to most people. The staff are super friendly, and the place is clean so it's one of my new favourites."}
{"text":"Today's special. Get rid of the left over chicken. Had there gyro special of the day, and the shawarma. Never threw out a shawarma but I had to after eating half. And it's slimy yucky ew. Go to Osmows because only McDonald's is worse."}
{"text":"Bought the 12 pc chicken dinner set. It was awful. This yellowish dark chicken meat which has no taste. Soggy and not crispy with a gap between the breading and the so called chicken so when you take a bite all the breading falls off. Very disappointing. I finished the first 3 pcs choosing the nicest pieces I found in my 12 piece set. But each piece I had made me realize it wasn't getting any better. I threw the rest out. I wouldn't feed this to my Boston terrier who will eat anything that drops on the floor.   I think the quality of the chicken this place gets is very bad. Either that or the prep work they put in is what's making this chicken turn out bad."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken shawarma plate with rice. There was lots of small prices of bones from chicken ribs and back in the shawarma and plenty of chicken fat/skin.  So disappointed. Won't try again"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and their chicken strips, and fries! They also had a variation of the chicken over rice concept and we loved it. Very good halal option!"}
{"text":"The food is always good and freshly prepared . I like the menu layout - it's a great place for informal meals and when you don't want to cook at home . Overall great . A bit more interior lighting , a better list of specials and a nicer table setup would give it 5 stars .  Not a fan of the big crisp burger - too much bread I think . But the bonelsss chicken strips are great !!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal! This place actually CARES about the quality of their food. They are a chicken shop. They don't fancy themselves trying to be yet another place that tries to be everything to everyone which is why I think they get the quality right. Pretty much everything comes as grilled or fried so there's smarter choices for clean eaters, the rotisserie chicken is seasoned perfectly and the chicken and waffles + mac n cheese bites is my personal fave! If I have one criticism it's that the salads are mediocre (who puts radishes in a house salad?) but the quality of the chicken they use in it helps compensate.   Now here's what cemented the deal for me. The other day I was in placing my order, it took a little time but a part of me valued that since it was made to order. When I got my order and they began bagging it, the cook called to the cashier and gave her a small container which had a single mac n cheese bite in there, she turned to me and said \"the cook just noticed your order was one short\" and added the single bite to the container with the others. I was done. Never have I ever thought I would be floored by the integrity of a quick service food establishment. I write this as I head out there right now to place another order.   Happy to see a fine establishment like this in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Tried on recommendation of a friend...maybe it's time I find a new friend :( The chicken was dry and had a rewarmed heatlamp flavor. It obviously wasn't prepared fresh. The portion for the cost was small. My kids were still hungry after eating their meal.  I think it has the possibility to be good, but isn't at this point.  Update - a couple years later things appear sorted out. The Thursday chicken burger is made fresh (takes some time) and has a fresh bun and condiments. It is a bit spicy but yummy. Drink lots of water as food is oversalted. Other dishes are good, but not stellar. Other than that good for a rushed night and kids like."}
{"text":"Not enough good fried chicken in Oakville so had to try this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  This golden crispy nugget is squared away in a small plaza with limited parking.  Service is friendly and there are 6 tables and a window seating area.  Ordered 2 piece fried chicken dinner combo.  A lot of side options including rice, fries, wedges, onion rings, salad, and slaw.    Takes a while for the food to be prepared but it's worth the wait.  Light crispy not greasy chicken. . . ."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for a few times due to the convenience of the location. Every time I was hoping the food would get better. But unfortunately chicken fingers and popcorn chicken were always very dry. Regurlar fried chicken pieces were okay. I would actually recommend their waffles. Kids love them."}
{"text":"Great place for some delicious chicken and no guilt.  I had lemon pepper spiced chicken and then we got chicken sandwiches for the road.  I don't know which is better, I ate like 18 wings at the restaurant and 1 sandwich once we crossed the border. I admit it was a real food smuggling operation but man was it worth it without a doubt. -:) I give them 5 stars just because I can hardly find great halal food like this.  It is a gem and you natives must be happy to have it....if anyone is heading over to NY anytime soon, buy some chicken sandwiches and shoot me a message."}
{"text":"Best Halal outside of NYC. Don't miss this place. Try the chicken gyro. This is served NYC style. Can't wait to go back for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Good ol' comfort food in Oakville.  This is the second time I've come here. Today, we ordered the Wednesday special of chicken gyro with rice ($6.25) and 4 piece strips combo ($7.5).  This fast food restaurant seats about 25-30 (tables and bar stools). Posters on the wall claim that their oil has no trans fat and no cholesterol.   The gyro was good, especially for the price, but the chicken strips stole the show by far.  As advertised, they were crunchy from the outside and tender inside - plus, HOT since they were freshly fried. The garlic dipping sauce was finger lickin' good as well."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The chicken had a lot of fat and it had no flavour. I wished they could've made their chicken taste different and more special. Overall the waffle was good but the fried chicken wasn't good because of the taste and quality of the meat."}
{"text":"Onions rings are awesome. And the crispy chicken burger is like a Mc chicken but better quality chicken and more flavour. They use the same buns tho was really impressed. The popcorn chicken is also good."}
{"text":"BEST fried chicken EVER-- preservative-free REAL FRESH chicken and sauces/sides.  My first experience with chicken pieces that are very crispy, moist but not greasy- literally my fingers weren't oily after!  I can't pick my favorite sauce - chipotle, garlic, sweet n sour.. and apparently they are all homemade.   My husband got the lemon pepper wings which I thought I wouldn't like and we ended up having to order more for take-out later because the flavor is so good and leaves a little taste on your lips to enjoy after the last bite ;). We came back once as we were only in town for the weekend and got an amazing crispy chicken sandwich that was big, filling and nice n spicy.  The rotisserie chicken was also delish.  I think there was an onion ring in the chicken wrap - nice touch (we brought some home -not all in one shot :) ) Need one of these in Astoria please!!"}
{"text":"Great place to order fresh fried chicken. This was my second visit and both times I ordered the big crisp and the chicken was made to perfection!"}
{"text":"Delicious fried chicken waffle? There's no catch - the price was only 8$! A fancier version of KFC/Popeyes if you want to step up your fried chicken game."}
{"text":"I was waiting for this to be up on YELP forever ! This a great fried chicken place with different sauces to choose from. Honestly, if you like bomb friend chicken, ditch Popeyes and KFC for here!"}
{"text":"Sounds like most reviews would agree that this place is hit or miss. I gave Chicken Squared 3 stars based on the fact that my wings were OK. I think that ordering them with sauce on the side was a good idea.   The interior is clean, (probably because the place is new), however the service is really slow. There is a sign asking people for patience because the food takes time to make as it is being cooked \"fresh\". So if you get your food quickly, you might suspect its been there for a while.  I had the wings and they were medium to small size but tasted good. The order took about 20 minutes from time of ordering. The counter staff was friendly and apologized for the food taking so long.  Pricing is OK and the menu features a number of different types of chicken dishes for either fried or oven roasted chicken. If you stick to the basics, I think you'll find the food is good. And if it takes a while, then you know it will be the best it can be."}
{"text":"Would give it 0 if I could.  So I walked to the plaza and decided to give it a try instead of the pizza store in the same plaza.   I ordered a chicken sandwich and walked home. Before eating I had decided to inspect the sandwich just to have a look and upon checking underneath the chicken patty was a LONG black hair curled up between the bottom bun and chicken. That was garbage off the bat.   Also ordered the chicken wings - nothing special either. Haven't ventured back to try anything else.   I saw another poster post about Shawarma If your looking for a good meal? Try Chefs door at third line and Dundas way better food and at least they make it in front of you so there's no surprises. Not impressed by this chicken place on the first visit."}
{"text":"This is a chicken joint, so think:  wings, oven roasted, burgers, strips, wraps, in salads, & popcorn chicken.  HOWEVER, they also have additional items such as:  gyro, shawarma, fish & chips, a bunch of sides, and a brownie.  So if you're feeling particularly indecisive, you may feel overwhelmed.  So it may be a good idea to check out their website and do some pre-ordering so you have an idea of what to order!  And as per the sign, plus the helpful and friendly cashier, everything is made-to-order so there's no burgers sitting under heat lamps waiting to be ordered.  Not ideal if you're expecting super quick turn-around.  Despite the cashier saying that they're known for they gyro - ??? - I wanted to go with something CHICKEN, as per their namesake.  I ended up getting \"The Big Crisp\", kinda like their version of McChicken.  Since it's an actual piece of chicken, don't expect a perfectly round, processed puck-like patty!  Wait was approx. 10-15mins.  They have their own burger sauce, but I requested it spicy, so I got extra jalapenos.  It was super tasty!   If I'm back in this area and have a hankering for fried chicken...OR gyro, I won't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Been going to their old location in Oakville for years. This location is a nice addition to Mississauga and provides a great alternative to the lack of great, halal, comfort foods in their area.  I love this place for their Crispy chicken sandwhich, popcorn chicken, fried mushrooms, fried Mac n cheese bites and even the fried chicken n waffles for when I am feeling a little extra adventurous. On top of a wide menu of fried chicken n fried chicken related items, they also sell grilled chicken as well as charga chicken (south asian spiced grilled chicken) and some fried fish as well which makes this place great to pick up for a lazy Friday night in.  Great food at good prices!"}
{"text":"Oakville isn't really known for it's comfort foods or even fast food options for that matter...but FINALLY...the fat guy kid inside me has a solid place to go when i'm looking for a greasy fix.  While the popcorn chicken is a MUST HAVE, the sides are all well above average as well (onion rings - amazing, wedges - great,  fries - good), what's even more impressive is that they also cater to those that are trying to protect their waist-lines.    The concept here is to provide above average chicken, whether fried or rotisserie style, and they've done just that.  The prices are also very reasonable...particularly for the quality of the food that you get.  My wife and I got two fried chicken sandwhich combos which were awesome and an order of popcorn chicken (all white meat - tastes like the kernal/colonel (is that right?)...except with REAL pieces of chicken).  This all came out to just under $20...but the portions were big and we had enough leftover popcorn chicken for another meal.  They also have their own special mayos which I believe are made in-house...i'm pretty big on sauces so that won me over and earned this place it's fourth star.    We went back to try the grilled/rotisserie chicken as well as the chicken fingers and we were not disappointed.  The grilled veges that come with the rotisserie chicken were surprisingly better than expected...the grilled chicken however left a bit more to be desired.    All-in-all...Chicken Squared is a welcomed new addition to Oakville.  I'm very happy that they've setup shop close to my house.  This is exactly what I've been waiting for...a good place that I can frequent regularly and not have to worry about breaking the bank every time I do so...  ps. this place serves halal meat."}
{"text":"The food is good actually pretty good, but the people working are a little too slick, Make sure to check your receipt, they like to Overcharge, won't give you everything that comes w the combo you might order and nickel dime you some days! As much as I'd love to support small businesses, this kind of beahviour only works against the success of such places."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken! Also great chicken sandwiches, and the chicken and waffles is a personal favorite (the waffles are nice and fluffy). We don't go often as it's not the healthiest food, but when we're in the mood for something tasty and fried, this hits the spot every time."}
