{"text":"Worst service I've ever received. Called in to order, was told 40 minutes...an hour later I call to ask if it's on its way. He responds saying very soon sorry. I wait another 30 minutes when i call again to say it's been an hour and a half and I was told 40 minutes, may I ask why it's taking this long? Again he responds saying soon sorry and hangs up. After two calls, and 20 more minutes (totalling 1h 50min) it's delivered.   Excited to finally have my food, after somewhat losing my appetite because of the service.  My rice is split with my sweet and sour chicken, to which I paid full price to have each in their own containers. Ordering for a family of 4 that barley fed 2 people. Also, the food was cold. Why on earth would someone pay $40 for this kind of experience?  I've never called to complain to a business. I call and instead of the woman providing me with any kind of solution to my half delivered, cold order... She tells me \"Sorry too busy call you later\" and goes to the other line. I've never come across this kind of service in Woodbridge, ever. I'm always given wonderful and prompt service. Weekends get busy and I'm understanding but when you don't have the respect of at least giving me proper customer service or the respect any human being should be granted, then I think you're confused with how you should treat your customers.   I will not be returning. I did not eat the meal. The worst experience."}
{"text":"Minimalist Chinese Take-out with a few Tables for nearby students during their Lunch-break.  Minimal as in barely any selection of clean-looking plastic forks, spoons, or knifes.  No paper napkin(singular) offered or appear anywhere. Minimal as in they don't even have a garbage bin.  No Ice Tea available for the student ordering.  No Rootbeer and I had to settle for C-plus.  The less than friendly Chinese Lady working the counter seemed to imitate Bobby Lee(MadTV) as he imitates a Chinese Lady.  Short, to-the-point, no-nonsense, high-pitched, order-and-get out-of-my-sight type.  Complete de-ja-vu because it's identical to another place I visit once in awhile but unlike the students that visits August Moon, I do have a choice.  This place makes me wonder why Jamie Oliver isn't around this neighbourhood promoting his efforts.  How identical you ask?  I'm not even going to write out the Menu or the Food.  Look at my other review and you'll know exactly.  Maple Dragon:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/maple-dragon-chinese-restaurant-maple  Update: I've seem to misplaced my 1.5 *Star* list, so 1.0 Star it is."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant last Friday.  All I can say is the food was amazing and I loved the open kitchen.  The owner was very friendly, and his wife does the cooking.  This is defiantly my first choice for Chinese Food Take Out."}
{"text":"They changed their name to yummy wok. Same unpleasant staff, same unappetizing food.. and they didn't give me sweet n sour sauce for my s&s balls   I want to vomit, now I know what a cheater feels like, I'm sorry mandarin, it feels like I have an sti in my gut...  If I ever spoke poorly of any other restaurant add an extra start to their rating... I'm contemplating of inducing vomiting but chemical help line says you should never do that...   Rip max  PS I tossed most of the dish out.. sorry for wasting food.."}
