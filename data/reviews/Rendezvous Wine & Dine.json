{"text":"The #1 reason why this place is going out of business: HORRIBLE DJ's WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO MIX, and DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN KARAOKE. 

They've got amature wannabe's trying to dj. What an embarassment. The stupid owners of Rendezvous say they're trying to compete with Moda, but they insist on using their waiter as a DJ. What a joke. And the other Ballroom DJ they have is basically a mute (he never talks), and is only good for dancing to his own favorite music, and taking pictures.

Carding's made the same exact mistake, thinking they could have their friends and family DJ for their new business. And now, they have NO business. How sad."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Staff was very unprofessional, employees are complaining about management and most importantly, food was so horrible and stale! Sorry but you guys give a bad name to the Filipino community. Avoid this place and run back out."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I must say the food is just ok, don't waste your time and money as there are plenty of good places in Vegas for a night out.

I also found out that the owners keep using the \"Under New Management\" bs but are still the same people who are not paying their workers properly ie. A worker said all they received was $375 for three months of hourly pay and there are other people who have said the same so stay away from this place!!! Hello!?!? Nevada has a minimum wage!! Let the owners know that the horrible treatment of their workers is totally unacceptable!

Too bad I can't put a zero star, Rendezvous does not even deserve one."}
{"text":"We had birthday party for 70 persons last Sept.17 and 90 % of guests were out of town. Food were not enough, and 1 worker, stated, \"because of food were only good for 30 people\"?.How dissatisfied and disappointed we were! Some of our guests had to go to nearby restaurant, to eat as one had low blood sugar. Party was supposed at 5pm and host had to request to serve dinner at 6pm! It was supposed a buffet dinner and per person, but buffet containers were empty. Won't recommend to anyone!! Good thing, our guests were mostly family and close friends!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, you don't come here for food. Food is horrible, it is zero star for me. However, the entertainment is 5 star. We enjoyed dancing and singing. Monday night is fabulous because it was not crowded at all. We had some time to sing at our hearts desire and we had a lot of space to dance. Thumbs up to DJ/Photographer Mike. He was awesome! I'd come back for more dancing and singing."}
{"text":"."}
{"text":"Great for parties, it's energetic and I like the spirited DJ host. It's probably just me, but I'm not fond of the food. Everyone else seemed to like it though, but not me. Imo, the buko pandan is the only thing I like. Do I recommend? If you like parties, dancing and having a good time, sure. A place to dine, eh."}
{"text":"I recommend this awesomeness wine/bar Restaurant...The food is so delicious, I guarantee it...
New management and new Chef"}
{"text":"Great place for parties and family gatherings. Food is great! We had our get together from work and Irene was so nice enough to cater all our needs. We had the VIP treatment! Love the newly renovated place. We will definitely come back! Thank you Jay for the awesome treatment!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star. The place changed it's name, it used to be Barkada. The service sucked and until now, the same! I was at an event in this place recently and no one served drinks or even asked most people at the tables if they want anything. We were left to get our own, to ask if there were servers. When u tell them what u need, they never come back.. The celebrant's family that paid for services that wasn't rendered asked for a to go box, and the waitress just said, \"oh I don't know if we can give a to go box, I have to ask the manager.\" Hello! Just for that? Really? We'll just buy some at Costco and give them some for the restaurant, maybe even that they can not afford coz of no budget from bad business. This place needs to close. No professionalism at all. Shame to the Filipino name."}
{"text":"Food was excellent Band Terry Wayne Project was exceptional. Played mix of everything. Not too crowded dance floor."}
{"text":"Love this place !! Great for parties! My friend had her birthday party and we all had a amazing time !! Staff was amazing !"}
{"text":"We attended a private event on Sat March 5th 2016 that was sponsor by Polynesian Connection Point After the band perform that night called the \"MIRIMA from the ANIVA\" is beyond the worse band that entertain, they should never be allowed to entertain it was a waste of my money and time We came from Cali expecting a good time but ended up very disappointed people were sleeping and leaving because the music SUCK as FUCK that singer and her band need to go get their lives and the DJ omg when it was his turn he was just as bad the sound system suck"}
{"text":"If I could put a 0 star I would! This place is awful, the staff is awful, the location is awful!! It smelled like raw sewer inside. When we asked about the smell they proceeded to tell us that it wasn't their fault it didn't smell like that earlier until we a party of 60 plus had arrived. Trying to look for employees in the place is like looking for where's Waldo ( I pretty much think that they couldn't handle the smell themselves so they were hiding! ) none of they guest were waited on, no one was offered water! Don't get me started on the DJ or lack there of! PLEASE do your self a favor and NEVER GO HERE!! We have contacted the Health Department about this place! Serving Food in a place that smelled like Raw Sewer is unsanitary!! And they wouldn't even address the issue!! Further more after our event was over they proceeded to ask to be paid for gratuity!! The most unprofessional place I've ever come across and they want to be paid for it!! NEVER GO HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT!! This place getting a 1 star from me is the Gratuity it deserves!"}
{"text":"I flew in from Nebraska to attend a birthday party that was being held at this establishment. Food for 70 people was ordered since a lot of the guests were out of towners. Food for 35 people was served. This was unacceptable as so many people did not get food during the party. This business is claiming that there was miscommunication with a manager that no longer works there. I would think that someone would call to clarify the food needs prior to the party just to make sure everyone is on the same page. 

My advice for those of you who are looking for a venue for a big party is to avoid this terrible mistake and find a different venue unless you want your guests to go hungry due to the lack of food prepared."}
{"text":"Just celebrated an awesome birthday party with close friends and loved ones. Food, ambiance, entertainment and service were excellent. Not only did my guests enjoy the live band, dancing and delicious food, but was well taken cared of by the service given. Thank you for making my birthday celebration a wonderfully memorable one shared with my loved ones."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out! They have better parties than most of their competitors. The place is fancier and high end. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I think they're ripped off.  Private party cost 35/per person.  the food was not good. The price package they charged 5K/ 120ppl  was too pricey. not including alcohol at least beer.  Where do they get a DJ who doesn't speak just playing music the whole time.  When your paying for entertainment they should get a decent DJ & know how to entertain guests. DJ MIKE SUCKS. You have to learn more about how to get the party going. The manager /owner walking around wearing T shirt and flip flops.  Come on be professional at least wear a shoes not flip flops. You want business earn it don't ripped the customers. 
Not worth the money the customers are paying. Will not recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place seems like alot of fun if your looking for some live entertainment and good Filipino food. I ordered the sisig plate and the meat was good, not overall salty and the meat was soft. The fried rice had the right amount of garlic, Felt like I was at one of my Tita's house for dinner. I will definitely come back again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time there last night we were supporting a friend by the name of JONATHAN. The food was good and hot the menu had a lot of choices and the lemonade was delicious! If you're looking for a good time out Wednesday night is the night!!!"}
{"text":"So... I was invited to go to a birthday party there w/ a friend; close as family. All seemed well until I actually got out of my car. The parking lot smelled of raw sewage. Made me sick, but I thought, \"It's Vegas.. It always smells like raw sewage.\", so I moved on. Walked into 'Rendezvous' and the smell was just more concentrated; I had found where the smell was coming from. Now, one could understand the circumstance of the situation, the toilets having problems, grease traps; It happens, but this place looked run down, old, and dirty and the vibe was awful. As I looked for an employee I saw none, so I just went to my assigned seat. My aunt comes up to us to talk arrangements and she is furious w/ the lack of communication from the staff leading up to the event, so much so she can't even concentrate on the task at hand. We settle down, finish our discussion, and move forward. Keep in mind the smell is so strong at this point it just makes you almost sick. I look around only to see a few girls in black throwing cheap air freshener all over the room, which makes for a wonderful packed-litter-box/8-different-cheap-smells kind of aroma. -_- Looking for water and I notice that 2 out of 9 tables in the room had water. Had to get my own water. The DJ was AWEFUL, and yet a great photographer?? Our family had cameras. (Keep in mind ZERO service for 3 hours and smelled like *#^&!) Come to find our family is billed gratuity for no service. It was a JOKE!!

There are countless other cons and disgusts that my family and friends have to say about this place. It was also their experience, so it's not my place to put them all here in this review. All I can say for that place is I hope It gets shut down. It's a waste of space. 

UPDATE: Just received this private message from the DJ. Pull yourself together, Rendezvous.

Michael L: \"you suck to we were short of staff and i even let u guys play ur own music too and ur going to say the dj is aweful ur stupid you dont even know whats going on behind the scenes dont come back again pls\"

Needless to say I gladly won't be back."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and drink prices. 

We came here for a show, Meow Meow, she is a female hypnotist. We showed up early to grab dinner and a couple drinks before the show. The food was pretty good we had the pansit, pork belly, and lumpia. The pansit was really good huge order and really flavorfull. The lumpia was good as well, however $9 for a fried app was pretty spendy. I was not a fan of the pork belly which  was really over done/crunchy didn't enjoy it.

The beers were pretty cheap, $3.50 for a domestic not bad, they charge per glass for soda.

The bill was a bit deceiving... they have automatic gratuity (only 2 in our party) which they didn't tell us and on the bill they have the tip percentages and a spot for a tip so if you didn't really look at the bill you would definitely give another tip... Kinda shady!!!!

We stayed for the first 3 comics they weren't that funny, we ended up leaving early, after the mic kept dying. Meow Meow was hard to understand and not funny at all!!

I would probably try it a different Filipino restaurant before going back to the spot."}
{"text":"I had fun at this place good dj good music food and drinks. People that work there were friendly and funny."}
{"text":"The best Filipino restaurant in town! Good food, good music, good vibes. Love this place! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very fun place. Local spot with cheap drinks & decent food. Latin night is fire though! I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is somewhere between a bar, a karaoke, and a restaurant. 

My family drove to Vegas to attend a private party held by my relatives here for one of my grandma's 90th birthday party. Food took about 30 mins from the time we got there to when we were able to eat. At first I thought they serve you food, but it was more of a buffet style. All the food were Filipino dishes, including lumpia, pancit, adobo, fried chicken, caldereta, chicken curry (a little spicy), and sweet and sour fish.

Overall, food was underpar. We had a party of 70 and it looked like they made food for 50. Considering that it was buffet style, I only went back because there wasn't enough food.

However, I really like the karaoke and the dancing. The first hour they made a tribute to my lola by playing her favorite Filipino song. Then they played dance songs. After there was a live band for the following hour. I really like the entertainment because it was fun for most of the family."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food & drinks are really good, the entertainment is awesome fun place dj, band & karaoke very nice environment"}
{"text":"here tonight for a friend's bday dinner. been waiting for over an hour for our food, and guess what? their 2 page menu? about half of them--apparently, \"they're out.\" what food they had and were able to bring out within half an hour wasn't bad, but seriously guys. learn how to run business properly before you open to the public. Yelp, please make ZERO STARS an option."}
