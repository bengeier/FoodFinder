{"text":"Had a new menu but limited it to next to nothing.  Complete disappointment as had heard good things, but when you can't even have a complete burger menu, extremely limited entree menu it is not worth the time.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for cocktails and a appetizer at the bar and both were not good at all. Cocktails were so weak we had to order a double and it seemed to me the bartenders had no clue. Most likely won't be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Just not great. Food very under seasoned or very over seasoned. The risotto ball is literally just deep fried boiled rice, zero seasoning. Fish sandwich is massive. Also no flavor. GM or AGM walked over to us to give us our side that we asked for 15 minutes earlier, didn't even notice that our water glasses weren't filled, didn't take our dirty dishes. Nothing. Also killed four mosquitos in our booth. I mean it wasn't horrible, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We went to Fourk for the first time last night and it was delicious.  Especially if you like sushi, poke, their tuna tacos were AMAZING just the perfect amount of everything.  We had that as an appetizer, we had salads for our entree along with a kids meal and two desserts.  It was all delicious and we will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Meh...I had high hopes after reading previous reviews, but unfortunately the service was poor and the food was so so."}
{"text":"A unique restaurant in a unique location.  One of the best hamburgers I have had in quite some time. Recently under new management, yet no kinks in the service or food preparation.  The menu was not massive as if over-trying to offer a subpar meal to everything. However it was diverse enough to please most everyone without being burdensome. Manager and executive chef came to table to welcome us and to assure our dinning pleasure.  We were very pleased and will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have to say that this place has really been hit or miss.  We went in for dinner a week or so ago and the experience was very underwhelming.  Several of us ordered the pasta special which was not very good at all.  It was a penne or ziti with sausage and shrimp with an orange sauce squeeze bottled in lines over the top.  Again, It was not very good.  My wife had the fish special, it was watery and not cooked properly, also not very good.  The drinks are ok, but relatively expensive, we are not ones to order the drink specials, more of a martini and Manhattan type couple.  At $10 or $12 a drink, we were in for $75.00 plus tip for 2 drinks and dinner.   I don't have a problem spending money like this on dinner, but this was just not worth the money.  I have also been here for happy hour, the bartender told me that I can't just order a martini to get the special pricing, I have to order the super sweet and fancy drinks to get the discount, no thanks."}
{"text":"First off, thanks to all you Yelpers who gave this place some love!  It is because of your comments that my hubby and I ate there last night.... and we will be back!! First Impression;  Cool vibe, with a much needed update to the décor.  It is modern and sleek.   But there is a lot of warmth and friendliness from the minute you speak to Jeff!  He greeted us right away.  As we were waiting for our table ( only about a 5 minute wait ), we heard him get the names of a couple of regular customers so that he could call them by their name the next time they came in ! Pretty cool. The Drinks:   We went for Happy Hour and tried the signature jalapeno margarita... they were okay.  My husband is a margarita snob and was not impressed.  I am not a margarita snob and I was not impressed either.  Not bad, just okay. As for Food:  We shared the BLT Sliders, Chorizo and Goat Cheese Naan, the Margarita Naan and the Fourk Fries. Yum.  The sliders were soooo good!  I would definitely recommend these to everyone!!  Plus the Presentation is cool too.  And both naan pizzas were delicious!  The fries have an aioli balsamic drizzle over them... YUM !  What can I say?  The food rocked !  We can't wait to go back and try more!  We watched other plates go to other tables from off the regular menu and the portions were big !!  Everything looked scrumptious and we will be back to try some. The Service:  Mixed reviews.  Our server was friendly and nice... but after she took our order she kind of never came back to check on us... maybe we just looked so happy she decided we were fine.  I even had to flag her down to finally bring us our check.   BUT the Hero of the day was... that's right, Jeff !!!   He came over Twice to ask us how we were doing and seemed genuinely interested in the customers and their satisfaction.   Plus I asked him if he ever checked out Yelp and the reviews...he said he checks them probably 5 times a day!!  So it shows that our comments matter and he takes that into account !  This guy is a gem and I hope that Fourk knows that.  He knows how to keep the customer Happy !! Oh !  On our way out it looks like they have a room for larger groups - good to know!!"}
{"text":"Went to Fourk with a table of 11.  The waitress was overwhelmed.  Drink orders were slow and the food came out one by one.  My son-in-law's salad was brought to him 15 minutes after our meals were served.  The manager apologized and decided to help out.  He offered to get us another round of drinks, and we assumed they were comped, but he charged us for every drink.  The food was good, but they failed on service.  You only get one chance to make a first impression...and it wasn't good."}
{"text":"I took my family for Dinner to see how this new restaurant is, we were extremely disappointed. Of he 5 of us, only 2 got what we ordered or liked the selection we picked. My oldest daughter ordered the steak salad with the meat medium, it was well done and was a small portion for a $12 dish. My youngest daughter ordered the Penne Pasta and asked no chorizo sausage on it. They have the child's portion with no jalapeños and no cheese on it. My wife ordered the prime rib special and it came cold, the potatoes were steaming however. The grilled asparagus was bland and had no seasoning or oil on it. The serve was nice and corrected the bill to reflect the child's portion of Penne. We ordered the cupcakes and they terrible, small and we're subpar. I wouldn't return and recommend you not waste your time or money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very attentive waitress (sweet but hovered) and food was just okay. Would give it another try, but not into enormous, gluttonous portions."}
{"text":"Not surprised to see that Fourk is \"closed\"--or is it? New chef,  new management? Will this help? This space could be so sweet, but it was clear from the start that the original Fourk operators didn't have a clue. The irregular food and service were troubling from the beginning. Hopefully this time will be the charm."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally got the opportunity to visit Fourk which is located in the old Matchworks building.  We stopped in for a late lunch/ early supper this afternoon.   We each enjoyed a cocktail  until I got the bill.  I noticed that they charged me $1.50 for ice in my whiskey.  Now I don't object to paying for the drink, because it was within reason, but what I think is a little tacky is to itemize the drink and the extra charge for the ice which really came down to 30 cents a cube!!  My wife had a gin and tonic and it came with olives and ice, and she was not charged extra.  We both got ice waters with ice in them so I don't see the purpose of charging extra for ice, perhaps the owners could explain this tactic.  I just think this is a bad PR move for this restaurant.  I have been to other restaurants which have the same policy of charging extra for ice in your cocktail and it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Maybe I will start ordering my whiskey neat. Sorry for the rant, I'll move on, but I had to get that off my chest. Our waitress, Virginia, was really nice and friendly and provided quick service and checked on us several times to make sure everything was to our liking. My wife ordered the special - a half a rack of ribs and a choice of a side which was mashed redskin potatoes (see photo).  She loved both of her choices.  The ribs were meaty and seasoned very well.  The redskin potatoes were very tasty.  There was enough left to take home some ribs and potatoes. I ordered the beer cheese onion burger that I ordered medium with a side of the redskin mashed potatoes ( see photo).  I was a little disappointed with the burger.  The beef was done perfectly.  The beer cheese sauce was a little runny to say the least, it was more like a soup than a sauce and had saturated both the top and bottom bun so I opted to use a knife and fork to eat the burger.  The onions were almost non-existent, they might have been there but I did not taste any of them. The dish was not a catastrophe, it just needs some refinements, as it was tasty, but just difficult to eat. All in all the lunch was ok and I plan on going back there soon because they are in the process of reworking their menu and half of the menu items were not available.  I am glad to see that they are working on there menu items. To me it shows that they care and want to provide the best for their patrons.  I am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Food is poor, service is slow. This place is just like any other bar, it was a hell a lot better when it was a \"REAL restaurant\" not a want to be. They need to bring back Chef Ryan back so it can be an OUTSTANDING RESTAURANT again. My wife and I will never return until this happens."}
{"text":"Really good gastro pub food and excellent service over lunch with the family today! Server offered lots of local beer options and checked regularly on how we were doing. Shrimp and grits were great (snowing outside). Unique atmosphere. Great pasta with generous serve. Fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing, went with are 1yr old daughter and they were very accommodating drought her some toys to play with. Also my wife is currently pregnant and the server made her a strawberry lemonade that was not even on the menu. The food is all very fresh and the flavors are all spot on well seasoned and the fish portion is huge that comes with the fish and frites. The shrimp po boy was perfect the shrimp was cooked perfect and the house made hot sauce gave it a great kick that was cut by the lime slaw that was on the sandwich. Oh definitely try the margarita with the jalapenos.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time last nice. Decor is nicely done. Wide open for private dining. I ordered the tuna tacos and Cobb salad. Cobb salad was pretty good. Not your traditional Cobb as it had asparagus, which I did enjoy. Lettuce was slightly browned on some pieces and it was just slightly underdressed. Tuna tacos were too one note. Cabbage slaw and citrus taste overpowered. Could use some heat or salt (soy). My husband ordered the cod. While he enjoyed it, I tried a piece and though the texture was mushy."}
{"text":"We are new to the area, and Fourk is a \"find\".... So far everything has been outstanding, 4 visits in 2 weeks, tight menu, everything is as described and serves friendly and hot. And \"affordable\" - if you are in the area you will not be disappointed  Raspberry salmon ***** City chicken***** Scallops***** Burgers**** Great  fries - Large curly ***** Spaghetti squash***  Wine - prophecy, bargain blend   Give them on opportunity to please   I believe this is a new owner and crew - excellent"}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this restaurant and for the location (in the same building that once held The Perfect Match). The food was average at best - similar to an Applebee's (but with a nicer ambiance). My wife and I ordered the Margherita naan. The fresh basil was a nice touch. I had a chicken wrap and my wife had a chickpea wrap. Neither made you say WOW - again, they were just average. The cocktails were well below average. The ice tea and the mojito were bland and the cucumber-lime cocktail tasted like some gave me a glass of lime juice with just a hint of gin. I cannot recommend this place.  On a side note, I saw someone who looked like they may be a manager who talked to a table and then looked me in the eye before walking away. Not sure that this customer service (along with a disinterested waiter) further my desire to not return."}
{"text":"Husband and I went on Friday for dinner. It's Lent so there was a fish special. I ordered the French Onion chicken for dinner, and chose my sides as green beans and mashed potatoes. Husband ordered chicken wrap and side salad. His salad arrived first and it was just the run of the mill side salad. However, his honey mustard dressing was on the side and it has some added spices to it. He suffers from heartburn so he didn't eat that. We immediately notified the waitress - his chicken wrap was redone without it, and that was awesome of them. My food arrived and the chicken was great. I made sure to ask when ordering if the beans were plain or had oil. I was told they are steamed and salt/pepper are added. They arrived coated in oil. I also had a side of the roasted corn, but no potatoes. The corn looked good but was SWIMMING in oil. I tried a bite of the corn and it was pretty average. The space of Fourk has the potential to be really cool, but it's like an empty warehouse. It was super chilly so bring a sweater! We'd probably only go back if someone else wanted to go there. I appreciate that they remade my husbands meal without fuss, and I know it's my fault for not bringing up the no potatoes issue. However, my chicken was delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to check out what  all the hype was about and have dinner here. I'll start with the very lacking selection of choices on the menu then the prices compared to what is given portion wise which is lacking as well.  The salmon dish was good but of average size or less and quality, the fish & frites for $16 a piece of tasteless white mushy fish some french fries and purple bland slaw. A dish easily comparable to a fast food fish chain. The best part of the night the server was prompt and kind. I can not think of a reason to even try a second time honestly, however they need to expand their dinner choices if they see a long future."}
{"text":"We will not be back. First off the strangest waitress I've ever had at a restaurant. She was not well versed in the ordering system. They use small tablets and it took her forever to put each persons order in. She was more like a drill sergeant than a waitress. She asked if any of us was having a salad so she could enter that first then took the rest of everyone's order. She took my wife's lemonade glass and had to be asked to bring more. The lobster empanadas are not fresh lobster, I'm not sure if they are fresh made on site but seemed to be frozen and then fried there. The main courses, burger, wrap, chicken, were good but not great. We ordered the chocolate chip cookies and the teaspoon of ice cream was a joke. I know Mitchell's ice cream is premium but come on. The kicker was this morning Open Table informed me that Fourk said I did not show up for my reservation. We were actually 30 minutes early and the host station accommodated us but had trouble with their iPad system.  It was also uncomfortable when the waitress waited for me to fill out the tip on the tablet and sign. Just an uncomfortable experience all around."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! This place is so cute and cozy inside. We spent our time here on the patio which I love at well. There is an indoor/outdoor bar (it's under cover but they open what appears to be a giant garage door to get the outside feel) The patio is large but also very welcoming. There is a nice fire place that has couches and lounge chairs around it and also a giant connect 4 game. The food was delicious. I got the omelet and my fiancé had the pork sandwich -it's comparable to a Cuban. It was amazing. His fries were great as well  The server was friendly and checked up on us often. Again, highly recommend. Please come check it out!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Fourk. We came from out of town for my nephew's baptism, and had brunch at Fourk. Our waiter Marcel was attentive and personable - very impressive. Our party was large with several young children and he was very patient. I ordered the Cardinal Burger and it was wonderful - a top 5 burger for me. Almost enough food to not need the delicious fries it comes with! Husband ordered the breakfast naan with chorizo. Also good! I definitely recommend to anyone looking for something new in Mentor."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch.  Empty, dunno why bc it's fantastic!  Great food and service. Even our kids liked it.  They give fun twisty toys to keep them occupied.  We don't like in this area but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Service very slow. Would give them another chance just to be fair. Came A 5:30 on a Saturday. Not very busy until  7ish."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Husband had the beer cheese burger and I had the sweet and smokey...both were amazing. The mashed Redskins were great as well, our server was also the bartender and was friendly and attentive even with us seated at a table.   Our total bill for the 2 burgers, 1 soda and an unsweetened iced tea came to $28. The price was reasonable for the quality of the food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"As a girl that loves to support local and avid chains where possible, I couldn't be more excited for this spot to open. The concept is great along with the back story involving the Four main food groups. For starters, we got the calamari and cobb salad. Both delicious followed up by the Cardinal Burger (sunny egg on top is my husband's favorite) and chorizo and goat cheese naan.   We loved that they source locally, we will be trying their brunch menu and it is super close to home. Congratulations on opening and can't wait to see you soon!"}
{"text":"I came for brunch with some friends with few expectations. I'm normally on the west side and thought I was spoiled by the quality and quantity of places there, but Fourk was delicious. My steak and eggs were honestly amazing. The value for the dish is high, and I would highly recommend both the venue and the meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by because we were looking for something different than just downtown Willoughby, and we were so pleasantly surprised! The place is huge, with amazing space in between all the tables. Huge portions, and the burgers and short ribs were absolutely amazing. My bf and I are both disgusted by how much we ate, but we couldn't stop. Super friendly staff and amazing food - would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and 5 year old daughter just had dinner here and we loved everything about it. The menu has a great selection of fresh options from anything you want- fish,steak,chicken and veggie options.   They also offer an awesome kids menu for the picky eaters that is not just Chicken fingers and fries like everyone else , my daughter had breakfast for dinner it was awesome.   My wife and split the fish tacos and BLT slider apps they were great . We will be back to try the Saturday brunch or Sunday brunch.   Patio will be opening this week and the inside is 100% remodeled from previous restaurant.   This is a great new restaurant so give them a try you will not regret it !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for lunch. The remodel is beautiful. Open, airy, and you can see the kitchen. Very nice. The food was excellent. We had the calamari appetizer ($10). Lightly breaded perfectly cooked and tender. Delicious. My husband ordered the burger ($12) which is a hand made patty that was huge, stacked with plenty of fresh ingredients. It came with fries that are shoestring and seasoned well. He ordered his burger prepares Medium and it was a bit undercooked but delicious.  I had the Steak salad ($12) which was absolutely delicious as well. The service was excellent!  We will be back for sure with our family and friends!"}
{"text":"Great service, good prices, the food, outstanding, and a vodka martini to die for.  My new favorite food..ahi tuna tacos...yummmmm"}
{"text":"Great expectations led to serious disappointment.  I'd viewed the menu on line and had my heart set on a couple of things.  When we were given the menu we were told that we could only ordered the highlighted items, about a third of the menu.  What I was looking forward to was not highlighted.  One of the highlighted items I ordered also was not available.    I had a Caesar salad that was quite good but it was downhill from there.  The dirty martini I ordered was not drinkable.  Told the waitress I could not drink it.  She picked it up and said, \"Gee, it doesn't even look like a dirty martini.\"  She offered to ask a different bartender to make another, but I passed and drank my water.     My ribeye steak was unremarkable and bland.  I salted it for flavor.  The redskin mashed potatoes were okay.  The side of corn had something unidentifiable mixed in with it and was not something I wanted to eat.    My wife loves fresh green beans and her side of green beans was fresh, but she said they put some kind of oily sauce on them that made no sense.  This morning she said her food had sat heavily in her stomack during the night.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time here (it opened two weeks ago) after a spontaneous decision for Ordered brunch and was not disappointed. I ordered the pancakes and the wife ordered the Standard Breakfast. Both meals were delicious and were healthy portions. The staff was great and told us about the upcoming bar patio area that is being worked on. They will have live music for the outdoor area.  The kitchen is an open design so you can see the staff prepping your food.   The owner/chef's wife was there with their kids eating breakfast too. So if the kids are happy you know it will be good. When we had a question about a menu item the owner/chef's wife came by the table to offer a description. Great service here!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Cool spot ambience wise (great outdoor seating space), service was pretty good and they have a nice beer, wine and cocktail menu.  We started with Calamari as an app which was ok (frozen not fresh), we ordered a chicken wrap which was good and the Raspberry Pecan Salmon which wasn't great. The pecan crust was so oily that's pretty much all you could taste. Without the crust the dish would be fine. Mashed Redskin Potatoes and Roasted Broccoli sides were good the Sweet Potato side was not appealing visually or appetite wise as stated in an earlier review I wish I had read before ordering. Fourk has a lot of potential if they reevaluated their menu offerings and focus on quality ingredients. For the record wanted to give 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Really great find on our way back to Cleveland from Fairport. The shrimp and grits were amazing. We stopped for lunch and ate on the patio but I could imagine it gets busy at night or at least it deserves to be."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a weekday night. arrived at 430. The hostess asked if we had a \"reservation\". We did not. She then informed us that the entire restaurant was boWeoked with reservations. She also never asked if we wanted to sit in the bar, so we assumed there was nothing there as well. We then left and went to the adjoining art gallery for about a half hour. We were curious, so we checked back into the restaurant at 5. No extra customers were seated in the restaurant. We were not happy...hard to want to go back when we could have eaten and been gone before the \"reservations\" arrived."}
{"text":"Fourk is such an awesome and new find for my family in mentor! My parents just recently moved up here, and everyone in the restaurant welcomed them with open arms. They now go at least once a week, and are never disappointed with with the food and service. I have had the pleasure of visiting here 2 times now, and was very pleased and satisfied with my meals. The portions are very plentiful, and everything has a fabulous flavor. Oh! And don't forget to have the pumpkin pie with the bourbon maple whip cream- to die for!! Make sure to stop into this hidden away gem."}
{"text":"We went to Fourk on what I believe was their first vegan night(the full menu was also available), and conveniently enough, our vegan daughter was in town so this was a perfect option! The restaurant was not crowded and we were seated and ordered quickly. My husband had the Beyond Burger, our daughter had Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes and I opted for the Fettuccine Alfredo with Tofu. My husband prefers burgers with meat, but he was pleased with this one and said the flavor was good. My daughter and I shared our meals and the sweet potatoes had chickpeas that were roasted and had great flavor. I wasn't sure what to expect with Alfredo sauce made with cauliflower, but it was nicely done and interesting... In a good way. Overall, this was great, particularly having our daughter in town, but it is also nice to have some meat free options available. Their food is always good and seems to be innovative and creative as well, which sets it apart. Looking forward to summer happy hours on their patio!"}
{"text":"We were in Mentor Ohio shopping and looked for a place to eat on Yelp. Fours was close and had good ratings so we thought we would give it a try.  Upon driving up, the place looks like a medieval castle! It seems Fours occupies a space what was once a match factory. Very cool.  It was a Thursday night, so Britt the bartender showed us to our seats. We opted to sit in the bar area to watch and hear the guitar player. He was very good and his name was StevenJochum. Go check him out.  The drink options included a good selection of craft beers and good wines. Since they just ran out of Fatheads -HeadHunter, I selected a Double IPA from a brewery in Utica, NY, which was very satisfying.  The menu had a number of interesting options, however, I could not resist the Swordfish special with risotto and a salsa mango sauce. It was incredible! Outstanding.  The restaurant has a nice relaxed, comfortable feeling and we will be back."}
{"text":"This has potential. We had asparagus appetizer which was delicious. I ordered pecan crusted salmon which was tasty. Nice flavor. My side was sweet potatoe casserole which looked blackened/burnt. Not much flavor at all. Salad was huge! Daughter had city chicken. Had no flavor at all. Everyone at the table tried it and agreed. Other daughter got ribs which had great sweet flavored sauce, fell off the bone. Yum! The cheese macaroni was extra cheese and good for a side but possibly too much cheese?? Husband got the shrimp and grits which was the best meal of us all. Not too spicy and perfect flavored grits. Would go back for that. He has broccoli side which tasted good and roasted!  His drink was awful, the mojito but he said it was on. I had a margherita which was good.  This place is pretty inside and new. Very expensive for the just ok dinners. Might go back but too many other choices that are better. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. Fantastic patio area. Had a late lunch with a friend on a Monday. Ate inside. Had the place almost to ourselves. Ordered the calamari as a shared starter. Arrived quickly. Could have had more time in the fryer. Coating pale and not very crispy. Have never been served calamari that wasn't in the shape of rings, until this dish. Texture was also strange. Faux calamari? My friend had the salmon salad. Beautiful. She said it was delicious and the piece of salmon was large. I had the margarita naan. It was good but not outstanding or unique. Our server was attentive without hovering.  Overall it was a pleasant experience with no one rushing us to leave so we had a lovely visit. Will definitely go again to see if they can increase my star rating."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally try this place but unfortunately I was not that impressed my first visit.   The building is kinda spooky from the outside but the inside is built beautifully. Nice atmosphere. Kudos.  I came around 5 on a Sunday evening and it was not that busy but it sounded like 2 big parties were happening, one inside and one outside (it seemed like the manager was taking care of?) a little chaotic when I walked in as I sat at the bar. Overheard conversations. Some staff didn't seem to want to be there as they blatantly said this out loud. I get it. I'm a server too. Some days I don't want to be at work. But I try to keep my emotions out of earshot of guests. It's unprofessional and Ruins their experience and kinda did mine too.  They have everyday happy hour from 3-6 which is a plus. I don't drink so i was looking at the 6$-7$ app deals. Nothing really caught my eye except the calamari. I ordered this but soon was told they were out. Mehh...I just got the cardinal burger and substituted my side with the fourk fries ( Parmesan cheese and basalmic drizzle). The fries were pretty good but they are shoestring cut which I dislike a lot. I prefer thicker cut. They also could use some truffle oil..just a suggestion. The burger was cooked to order the way I liked topped with havarti cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. Burger was good but I wasn't blown away. Flavor was missing. Whether it be a lack of seasoning or no sauce ( I added mayo) I don't know but it was missing something. Overall the food was good but not blown away. I did only get a burger though. Entrees look good but a little out of my price range( I'm budgeting after returning on vacation so no splurging for me right now). I would return someday and give this place another try but will try my lengthy list of places I want to try first."}
{"text":"One \"hit\" and one \"miss\" so far. Unfortunately the \"miss\" wasn't handled like the big boys do (meaning comping disaster meal)"}
{"text":"Food was good once we learned what they weren't out of. Strange a fairly new restaurant is out of the wine and several beers we attempted to order that are on the menu. In addition also on the menu is grouper and broccoli. They were out of both. Then my friend ordered city chicken. She was excited about a blast from the past. Oops the waitress got her order wrong. Brought her chicken cutlet. In the end the food was delicious and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I came here because of the Yelp reviews.  We happened to go at happy hour. The drinks were delicious and at a great price. Having checked the menu beforehand, I knew what I wanted to try, the Grits. It was a shrimp and grits dish with mussels and clams. And wow, was it amazing. I have never had anything like it, and I cannot wait to come back here! It was out of the way, but it was worth the hunt through construction to find it. The atmosphere was relaxed, and the bar area seemed really nice. Staff was very good and kind."}
{"text":"This was an amazing little find after our baseball game was rained out.  We enjoyed fantastic service and delicious food. Our family of 4, 2 adults and 2 boys, enjoyed a calamari appetizer with a fantastic red sauce, chorizo pasta, grilled salmon with polenta fries and grits with seafood.  Our waiter, Dave, was amazing and very helpful.  Everything is made from scratch and tastes homemade.  It was a wonderful little surprise!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try out the new restaurant in the Matchworks Building and I'm very excited about what they're doing! They had only been open for about three weeks when we were there, so I hope to be able to try more and raise my rating. We sat at the bar on this trip.   When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed. The interior has been completely redone in a modern sheik style but they still left some of the brick walls of the historic building visible. The bar area is large and includes a comfortable lounge area with sofas and chairs and a TV. Besides the bar seating, there are a few tables in this area as well. It is comfortable and has a good vibe to it. The dining room is adjacent to the open style kitchen.   The bar staff greeted us and were friendly and one of the managers stopped to talk with us some. When it got busy, the staff was obviously struggling to keep up and still learning the menu. Hopefully this improves with time.  The pricing on everything seemed about right. The appetizers were all interesting looking as well as the diners. We had a difficult time deciding on which of these to try. I wasn't impressed with the salad or sandwich selections. Nothing there grabbed my attention and seemed like I could easily make them at home. The ingredients were basic. In this caliber of a place, I want to try new and interesting things that aren't in my fridge. Give us something unique! We decided on the tuna tacos, chorizo flat bread and scallop diner. The tacos and flat bread had great flavor combinations and we enjoyed them both. We never got to order the scallops because it got busy and we never had anyone come back to take our next order. The staff was overwhelmed by this point, so we paid and left.   I will definitely be back and hope they continue to be busy here and do well."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited Fourk this past Saturday night, we love to visit and support local places. For starters, the service was great. Marcel was incredibly friendly and attentive. The menu had enough choices without being overwhelming. We ordered the calamari for our appetizer as it is our old standby and I thought it was really good - but I'd go with something else next time we visit. My fiance ordered the cardinal burger and really loved it and I got the salmon salad. The food came out fast and tasted fresh, I was pretty impressed with their efficiency for not being open long. However, the fries could use some updating - quite boring and no real seasoning. I ordered the donuts to go - and they put three tiny donut holes in a huge to-go container, and they weren't great, especially for $6. We both look forward to returning especially to try out the new patio."}
{"text":"I had the grits with shrimp, mussels, and clams. My husband had the cardinal burger. Both were excellent. Must visit for a great relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wife and I along with another couple dined at the two day old Fourk and enjoyed our meal, however I believe in time this respected chef can improve. Our Tuna Tartar Taco appitizer was very good though  slightly stingy with the tuna. The delicious slaw overpowered the sushi grade tuna so much so that I hade to peek inside to confirm tuna was present. A little more tuna would have made it perfect. Speaking of perfect, the BLT appitizer was awesome.   My wife selected the Brick Chicken and raved about it all the way home, however very my Fish and Friets  (french fries) was a rather ordinary battered cod and ordinary french fries. Good, but nothing at all that separates it from the pack, and I know this chef is capable of better! Our waiter was enthuastic and professional and the atmosphere and decor is clean, neat, and industrial as it should be in the historic old building. We will be back because it was good, but mostly because with this guy's potental, it certainly will get even better as its tweaked further."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on a really good day. I had a salmon salad which was outstanding. My mother had some blackened scallops. Everything was prepared in a special manner Hope to come back and get this good a meal next time."}
{"text":"This was such a nice surprise in NE Ohio! The food was excellent and the service was even better. Pam, the CEO was filling in as a server for us; we found out at the end of our meal. What a great experience! Please, anyone in the area, come and check this place out- highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool place to go to, especially in the summer when the patio is open! Whether it's for drinks at the bars or dinner, I am never disappointed. Their steak salad is probably my favorite!"}
{"text":"Have visited twice -- found service and food to be excellent ! Very laid back atmosphere-- reasonable prices with fresh and innovative approaches. The only reason for 4 stars is that it would be great if there were a few small plate options--but that won't hold me back from going again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since it's been redone. Nice decor, a little minimalist. Service was good, but our waitress hovered a little bit. She was literally in a doorway watching us. I got the margherita naan which was awesome. The naan got soggy, but the flavors were there: fresh basil and a balsamic drizzle. I got the Match salad which was pretty basic but dressed nicely."}
{"text":"What a great place! The value is unbeatable. We got the salmon salad and steak salads which were generous portions, super fresh, and delicious for $12 a piece! For dinner!! The service was on point. The happy hour deals also look great!"}
{"text":"Came to Fourk for lunch today, I work right down the road and have driven by here as they have re-modeled it. A co-worker and I ordered the Lobster Empanadas as an appetizer, and they were taken out of the fryer to early and were still soggy.   I order the meatball hoagie and it was pretty good, only complaint was that it was drenched in sauce and ended up everywhere. The meal came with fries, which were fried well but they do the thing that Ruby Tuesday used to do and bring out a small thimble of ketchup to you when you ask.  Co-worker got the pork sub, which came as a seasoned pork with no sauce. He stated it was good but requested BBQ sauce for it.  The service was just fine our server was prompt and polite which is all you can ask, and the inside of the restaurant was clean and well kept.  Overall it was a nice vibe, I could see going there for dinner but it was a bit pricey for the quality of food that you get."}
{"text":"first off the owner needs good servers who are worthy of keeping the clientele  happy.. great service will keep this place afloat.. hiring mediocre servers won't keep this place alive.. there is a few servers who have worked at fancy fine dining places and are very tentative  ..but they need to let go the ones who never worked in those places... otherwise i don't see this place lasting a year!!'  service is one of the keys along with great dishes at reasonable prices... they have a patio but never have band!! they have bands once in a while... need more entertainment cuz when the snow comes there is no place to put a band!! ... they need to step up those game if they want to make it in Mentor!  earlier review: Wow!! very Trendy casual place. kinda like a retro 70's flair with modern decor. Huge patio with fireplace and open bar off side with garage doors. Great friendly staff and owners. We went for happy hour had drinks and apps and food was very flavorful and priced just right for happy hour... Half price for selected items and drinks wine and beers on tap. come and unwind and enjoy the sunshine but bring your shade or ask waitress for some .. yep they will give you shades if you don't have any! must try 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Fourk is a beautifully decorated new restaurant in mentor. My supper club met there yesterday for brunch. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming. The cocktail menu was unique and delicious. I recommend trying Fourk for happy hour. Cocktails and the appetizer menu on the patio robin the bar would make for a nice evening. For an appetizer We had the calamari and BLT sliders. Both I would order again. For brunch I had the fish sandwich with shoe string fries. Huge sandwich and very yummy! Dessert we shared the chocolate chip cookies with ice cream and the key lime pie.   Enjoyable experience. The only negative I have is that our waitress was not very attentive, which kinda put me off. I felt like she wanted us to just eat and leave. When my supper club meets, we like to make it an experience.... take our time and explore the menu and absorb the environment"}
{"text":"We will definitely be coming here again!  The food was fantastic and Vinny was an awesome waiter.  6 of us went for a late lunch on Saturday afternoon.  4 adult meals, 2 kids meals, and 4 beverages for $64.  You cannot beat that for the quality of the food!  Seriously- check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went to Four for lunch Friday with my wife  Very nicely decorated in old Matchworks building Very modern and clean looking  My wife had grill cheese and ttomato soup She liked very much We had lobster empanadas appetizer with slaw  As appetizer  Was also good I had Cobb Salad with asparagus grilled  Walnuts and bacon   Was also good We tried the chocalatr cake with ice cream for desert which was very fresh and good"}
{"text":"Loved this place. It's a bit out of the way, but there was a good variety of selections, some quite unique. Farm to table. Good service. I recommend it."}
{"text":"It is sad, but Fourk has gotten f-ed.  I have never seen so much a good  menu get ruined so quickly.  Fourk was a spectacular bistro with good food and great drinks before the new ownership took over.  Now, the quality is lacking across both food and drinks now.  Honestly, don't even bother with Fourk now, just go to a TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday to get equivalent food for half the price."}
{"text":"Took my family for dinner on an early Sunday evening at Fourk since it had good reviews and star average. Despite never learning our server's name, our waitress was excellent. The food was described as fantastic by our whole family. I had the Brick chicken and it was scrumptious. I ate the entire entree. Chicken was moist with crispy skin. I also recommend the jalapeño margarita. I encourage everyone to check this place out and keep this great new restaurant in Mentor open!"}
{"text":"Went to the new, improved Fourk last evening and had a terrific meal.   Everyone in our group really enjoyed the food.   I really like the look of the restaurant, plenty of room allows you to talk with your group.   I had a burger and it was great, as were the fries.   Others had salads, city chicken, and BLT sliders, and all were great as well.    Service (Dawn) was very good.    My only complaint is that the wine list was pretty weak, and pricey.   Bottles that retail for 8 or 9 dollars marked up to a range of $30 - $35.    I'll go back and next time settle for iced tea with my meal. 5 stars for the food and service, 2 stars for the wine."}
{"text":"Fourk is a new restaurant to the area & you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't check it out ASAP. One of the best restaurant interiors I have seen in a while and by far the best margarita I have ever, ever had. Refreshing fresh and on point. The food menu offers something for even the pickiest eater. We ordered way too much since the menu had so many items we wanted to try - we split the chicken naan bread, tuna tartar tacos (I added a jalepeno from my margarita that gave it the perfect spice), fourk salad and the burger with bacon & sunny-side egg. Everything was fantastic. Highly recommend checking it out. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I reserving my fifth star until I go back to see if there is consistency. First impression was very good though. I had swordfish over risotto with corn puree. It's rare to get perfectly cooked risotto at a restaurant as most tend to rush everything. So that's a good sign. The puree flavor got a little lost, but the fish was excellent. I've always loved this building and hope Fourk can stick around. Glad to see the German place leave. The dining room felt cavernous. Manager and service were attentive and friendly. Looking forward to trying it again. Happy hour of course."}
{"text":"Very good service from hostess to server. Good variety on menu for apps, salads, sandwiches, meat and fish lovers. Plenty of options for a light or stuff yourself meal. Fair prices on food and beverage. Would have loved to try the pumpkin pie but was too full from ribs.  Ribs were tender and fall off the bone. Carrot slaw different with its slightly spicy kick. Smashed potatoes were tender and flavorful. Lemon Chicken cutlet juicy with just enough lemon flavor.  If this place had outdoor eating it would be a home run for casual dining. We will go again and will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner one night. They had no hostess and had a sign to see bartender for seething. Went up to that bar and was ignored, by what turned out to, be the manager. The place was dead inside with an awful band. Not sure about the food but heard it was mediocre. Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and the food and service was great. I was happy to see vegan options as well. They also have a separate party room that fits about 20 and a semi private area for even larger parties. Will be back again :)"}
{"text":"It was alright but for the amount of money you pay I definitely wouldn't recommend... We ordered an appetizer.. and entrees and the appetizer came out lukewarm... The Highlight was definitely the ribs I ordered... They were delicious... But it took them quite a long time for them to get our meals out and there was barely anybody in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is very good. We've tried several things on the menu and would recommend a trip to this local restaurant. Our server Marcel was informative and attentive. The salmon salad was excellent. The fish sandwich was huge, the slaw can be served on the side if you wish."}
{"text":"Spent our anniversary dinner here. Very underwhelmed. The appetizer came our with different ingredients than on the menu. One of our meals was under-seasoned and the other was over-seasoned. They did have pumking on the mine which was plus!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Mentor! Excellent food, unique and yummy cocktails, and very cute and cozy atmosphere. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes trying The Fourk for the first time. The building is historic, and the menu looked good. When we walked in, the ambiance was nice.   Unfortunately, both our meals left something to be desired.  I chose the French Onion chicken, which was delicious. My side choices, however, were not. The green beans were barely cooked and still quite crunchy and stringy. The sweet potatoes were anything but, had a strange flavor, and looked as if they had been way over cooked - they were a dark brown and not orange. I didn't eat them.   My dining companion chose the scallops over Cajun grits. The scallops were cooked well, and were served atop an overflowing plate of grits. Being from the South, she was looking forward to them, but was very disappointed. The grits were lumpy, and had no flavor (cheese nor Cajun).   We both left feeling disappointed and hungry. High hopes, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"This was an excellent choice for dinner! We went before a concert instead of eating downtown, but still felt like we were eating downtown!  I had the buffalo cauliflower tacos, and redskin mashed potatoes.  My husband had the siracha chicken sandwich and fries.  Will return!"}
{"text":"This place is just what Mentor needed...nice place for a date night without spending an arm and a leg at a fancy high-end restaurant. We happened to arrive just before Happy Hour ended (which was a nice surprise considering it was a Saturday night) so we started with the calamari and a couple drinks. For main course I had the steak and Frites and my wife had the brick chicken. We ended with dessert, cherry ricotta cake and the chocolate fudge cake w/ PB ice cream....All the food was fantastic! The only reason I'm giving four-stars was because the service was a bit slow (maybe a new server?). Overall, very impressive...we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped in early afternoon on a Sunday to grab a drink and a little food before seeing a movie. Nice mellow friendly atmosphere, we just had a seat at the bar. The drinks were good (I was trying my wife's), I had a couple craft beers. We ordered a few appetizers that were all very good. Nice place, we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Made a detour off of 90E to stop here for lunch. Easy parking, great decor with wood and brick, great menu, good prices, and our burger and a crispy fish sandwich for me were delicious. Fish sandwich was huge. Wish we lived close. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A 94 year old WWII veteran once told me that one thing you learn quickly in the military is....never volunteer, wait until your assigned to a task. Having no military background I tend to not follow this wise friends advice and find myself overwhelmed with jobs I have volunteered for. After volunteering to reserve a restaurant in not so populace Mentor, OH for a swim team group of 40, I found that my task difficulty was magnified due to the fact that most restaurants were fully booked due to St Patty's day. After being rejected by a few other establishments, I called Fourk and was pleased that they could reserve for and accommodate our large group. I had previously reviewed the menu on line and read a few yelp reviews so I felt it was a safe gamble. However, I felt a bit of pressure from my 12yr old pre-teen to not choose a bad place. Well I must say that the staff at Fourk made dear old dad look good and turned my volunteering regrets into a worry free success. The food was phenomenal, the accommodations perfect and the atmosphere couldn't have been better. The \"older\" swimmers on the team chose a space designated for part of our group in a private room with a dart board and a skee-ball like bowling game. The parents joined tables together to make a long inclusive dining space for us to socialize and enjoy each other's company. The younger kids (11-13) found their spot at a large round table in the same area as the parents. One of our younger team members celebrating a birthday was crooned by a barbershop quartet that was totally awesome. Even the \"older\" teenage swimmers came out of their hide out to witness the show. I had the ribs, some of the best I've ever had. Now that's a feat since I love ribs and have eaten them in many famous rib places around the US in my business travels. I sampled the cheese fries off of one of our coaches plate and was very pleased.  The portions were large and the price was right. Thank you Fourk staff for turning the initial regrets of this volunteer and pre-teen dad into a pleasant success! I recommend eating at Fourk to anyone who likes good food and great service!"}
{"text":"We went to Fourk last night and it was amazing! We were coming from Geneva late last night and searching for a place to eat at about 10:30, the restaurant was about to close when we were just walking in.  The staff was very accommodating and super friendly, told us not to worry and grab a seat! The food we received matched their hospitality, it was great! Probably some of the best ribs I've ever had, fall off the bone and the sauce was delicious.  My girlfriend had the meatloaf and she practically licked her plate lol, wish I would have taken a picture  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will make a stop in if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. Erika was our waitress.  She was super sweet and was intentional about not rushing us through our meal.  The food was outstanding.  You will not regret getting the loaded fries or the spaghetti squash!"}
{"text":"Good food with very large portions!  They were able to handle our large group too!  The decor inside was trendy and spacious.  Hidden gem hidden in Mentor."}
{"text":"Loved the tuna tacos!!  Fork fries were amazing too!  Thank you for suggesting them Abbey!!  Hope to come back for a salad."}
