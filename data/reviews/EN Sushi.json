{"text":"So good I forgot to take pics of the many many dishes we tried! Unlimited iPad ordering, pop and tea included, Avocado pizza, mango salad, maki rolls, salmon teriyaki, noodles and deep fried banana drizzled with chocolate to name just a few of my favourite! 

We didn't have one specific server but the wait staff was great and very accommodating to the many special requests we had... Will definitely be adding this into the rotation!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time here. Would not return after the  service from the manager. I advised ahead of time I had a senior, 2 kids and an individual whose birthday we were celebrating. Stuffed us into a table where we were quite uncomfortable and we were even asked to move our chairs closer to the table. The food was lukewarm, and waited over 20 minutes for our first order. A drink spilled and the manager grabbed the glasses and slammed them on the bar. We were asking one of the server's a question and the manager said to her 'don't talk'. Wtf? Needless to say, I will not return and would not recommend this place. I'm so disappointed in this place that I was highly recommended.  A waste of $101.00."}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi places in Brampton, the service is great and the food and selection is standard to the other sushi restaurants in Brampton.  I love this place because you never have to wait for a table, they are quick with your order and the servers are always friendly and attentive.  Definitely MUCH better then the all you can eat buffets that are in the same area AND less expensive as well."}
{"text":"Came here because en sushi was renamed from the previous hockey sushi. I think the sushi was not that fresh and you could tell when you ate it. Ribs dish came to our table cold and avacado was mushy. Tempura and presentation of food and the service was good though. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Good food,good service and good place!! The best AYCE in town. And they also offer the free meal for the birthday person. I really recommend this place : )"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover and have probably tried every one in sauga! So I was feeling hungry, had some family in town and decided to \"venture off\" in Brampton to a new sushi place! It's in the same plaza as Wok of Fame buffet, I think this place might have been the old Hockey Sushi that I noticed nobody ever went to?

This is your typical sushi place that's all-you-can-eat and uses an ipad as the menu. It's good but not great...not so good that I would drive back for it. I'd rather go to the Wok of Fame. 

Cons:
1) nobody greeted us when we sat down. They just assumed we've been there before and knew how the buffet worked. All other sushi places I've been to, they greet you and offer you a drink right away but this resto also requires you to order your drinks (even water) from the iPad.
 
2) selection isn't that great. It's limited compared to other restos 

3) apparently they're known for their Thai. They only had one Thai dish...pad Thai (with your choice of protein) and it was ok, especially for one that's \"known\" for Thai. 

Pros:
1) their sashimi (salmon and tuna is what we ate) is excellent very fresh!

2) they have quick service and staff is generally friendly, if they decided to talk/interact with you. 

Of course, this is all preferences and just \"another\" review but I would prefer other sushi restaurants over this one"}
{"text":"I just placed an order for pickup and the food was great. I really enjoyed the nice customer service. I will definitely return for more. The lunch AYCE is a little on the high side, but I think I know the reason. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted, makes you feel welcome.
Keep up the great work and thank you."}
{"text":"I used to advocate for this place, but their standards have plummeted in less than a year. 

I frequent them often, recommended them as the best in Mississauga, to many friends and family. In my recent visits however, it has been less than mediocre -  sometimes there's bad nights, so I held off on updating my review until now. 

Suggestions for En Sushi (if they want to keep their patrons):
- Don't start turning down your lights just after 9, when you close at 10, and there's tables eating. 

- Sashimi should not arrive lukewarm.. what? How?!

- Tea also shouldn't arrive lukewarm. Let's be realistic, it was cold. 

- Please don't start cleaning and dumping out buckets of dirty, pungent water at 9, when people are still eating. 

- Dessert (Ice Cream) should not take 10 minutes when there's 3 tables of (2), and there's no food orders left to serve

Welp. That was disappointing."}
{"text":"A great value and very fresh. The all you can eat menu gives you choices from sushi to fried bananas and made to order, sure to please all who giv it a shot. This is my 2nd time in 2 days and I'm not bored with the selection. Fresh good with variety."}
{"text":"No complaints.  My go to sushi place in Brampton.  Everything was fresh.  Hot dishes served warm.... Actually more like too hot to eat right away!  Grilled octopus, dumplings, enoki beef, Dragon roll and unagi are favs.  Service is great-very prompt.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  Dishes come and go like clockwork.  Best on a weeknight, not too crowded.  Sat for 2 hours with no rush.  I think the prices are suitable for the quality food and service you get.  So worth it"}
{"text":"I love using the iPad. However one issue with the iPad. When you press \"submit\" there is no employee to confirm your order. They just start making it. Which makes it faster but if you want to make a change (like, remove cucumbers or something) you have no opportunity to do so. Not a big deal it just can create waste.

There is a good selection of food on the iPad, the pop is included and this place has that mocha (little square slice) cake for dessert. I love it! Except they limited me when I tried to order more than 1 per person. I had to order again, but they fulfilled it. Food is delicious and comes out quick. If I lived in Brampton I'd be coming here more often."}
{"text":"This place used to be Hockey Sushi but has now changed ownership and name (for the better). Servers are wonderful and friendly and the food is 10x better than it was before. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants are literally on every corner these days and everyone has a face.  I find that they are either BAD or GOOD there is nothing in between.  They almost all have pretty much the same items on the menu.  It all boils down to quality.This is where q sushi restaurant stands out to me.  The quality.  En Sushi is very good.  Orders come quick from the time the food is ordered.  All the cooked items are cooked properly and come hot very hot.  The sushi tastes very fresh and is rolled very tight.  Sushi does not fall apart.  I will be returning to EN Sushi I was very pleased."}
{"text":"I found that the menu is small, but there were rolls that I liked, such as the Brampton roll.  They do not have much appetizers such as different types of meat rolls, they do not have takoyaki and basically not much selection for hot food.

The place does look nice and the servers were attentive and quick.  The presentation was very presentable, best I've seen at an ayce sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"First time coming here.. it replaced the old AYCE Hockey Sushi.. They had the same layout same chairs which I think they should have replaced since the chairs have rips and holes..i think it's the same owners but just changed the name to see if business will improve .

Food wise the dinner selection isn't big big like other AYCE sushi place so I don't think it's really worth $20+ when you don't have a big selection.. 
I have to say I did enjoy their fried rice it was very tasty and not just cooked in soya sauce..the cheese wontons were good had little crab meat in it. Tempura is ok.. They need to remember to give the dipping sauce though.. rolls were ok not a big deal to brag about.. when it came to get-go g the ice cream for my son at first the server that was there didn't want to get his ice cream till we were done eating any main dishes which I find it odd cause most of the time kids want their ice cream after they eat while the parents are still eating.. But our original server came and apologize and said she was new and doesn't know.. so our server was nice but they need to inform all their staff esp new staff about the policy so customers won't get thrown off in wanting to come back..

Last thought it's not in my top sushi places so I don't k ow if I would go back or recommend anyone going there.. nd it's hard for that place to go against WOK OF FAME.."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, good price and not crowded. WhT else can you ask for ? 
I'm originally a heart sushi fan but that place got crowded fast and they increased the prices. Once I found en sushi, or became my new go to. The pricing is great, the food is always fresh and It is well served and well cooked. Love it"}
{"text":"I was visiting with family and decided to come here with our party of 12. The shrimp tempura was meh, the pork dishes were too tough to chew, and the service became non-existent after the entres were delivered. I don't know if it was lack of staff, but I waited over 25 minutes for someone to come back so I could get a glass of water. I finally gave up and got it myself."}
{"text":"Finally found a sushi place in Brampton that is decent ....
Walked in and the place was clean and the hostess and waitress greeted us which is nice .
The food was fairly decent and fresh with good selection and iPad ordering ! 
We will definitely come back ! 
Service 8-10
Cleanliness 9-10
Quality 8-10
Selection 9-10"}
{"text":"Free meal on your birthday! 

Yes, the meal is on them if you come in on your birthday. 

Service:
Super fast service! We ordered via iPad and the server didn't have to come by to confirm anything. Those types of ordering doesn't make sense to me. I mean, you might as well get the server to take your order if they would still have enough to come to you for your order to be completed.

With this software, it would be better if the iPad showed which of our orders were brought to us, aside from that, the iPad ordering is almost flawless. There was one order that was sent to us in two sets, even though it showed we only ordered one set. They must have dropped it on the wrong table. It's not a big deal. Overall, we were very impressed with the service. 

Food:
Meh. I personally prefer the hockey sushi menu. I thought it was way better (we went on a Sunday night). We were craving the Vegas roll, we were disappointed it was no longer there. The menu was typical stuff. They don't offer something only they do that would make them stand out compared to other AYCE sushi. The have a deep fried California roll. It sounds yummy, but that was also meh.  I would say their ice cream was really good. It was probably the best tasting part of all. It was the only thing that is distinctive enough to stand out. 

I personally wouldn't go back here again."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today and quite liked my meal. I had a basic all you can eat meal with sushi and kitchen items. The food presentation was a step up compared to 168 Sushi, Tokyo Maki and 520 Sushi. The fish was fresh. The IPad menu was easy to use. I appreciated the real chop sticks rather than wooden ones with slivers. Prices were lower than the prices at the Mississauga sushi restaurants that I have been frequenting lately. In other words, my 
lunch was very good value.

This restaurant is better than the two previous (Hockey Sushi and 88 Sushi) restaurants in that location."}
{"text":"#YELPGTA #SUSHI #BRAMPTONSUSHI #AYCESUSHI

The ex Hockey Sushi that I was never quite a fan of for the sub-par service, EN Sushi took me by surprise. The interiors are great, the service has never been better, and the brand new restaurant has iPad menus and real chopsticks. 

The food is plated well. They do a little extra something on the top when they bring out their plates of sushi and appetizers. For instance, our salmon sushi had some circled radish on the top. It's worth a mention because it's a nice touch. 

The food wasn't bad. And the cheese wontons were fantastic. My only issue - the salmon wasn't as fresh as I usually like it to be. I was surprised to see sesame seed ice cream on the menu - tried it, it was pretty terrible. 

The AYCE price included drinks at $15.99 for a weekend lunch. Not bad for AYCE."}
{"text":"We dined here on new years eve, made a reservation ahead of time but didn't need it as the place was half full when we got there. We were seated right away and the server was really nice.

What's cool is that they give you an iPad to order wirelessly and drinks are includes in the buffet the price.

The dishes were all appetizer size so you don't get full too fast. We didn't wait long for our dishes and they were all great. This will be another go to spot for us for sure."}
{"text":"EN Sushi, formerly Hockey Sushi. 

Coming from Vancouver, we're blessed with fresh and delicious sushi. When I travel, I usually try to go for different cuisines that I can't get as easily at home. But on my first night in Toronto, my grandparents insisted on sushi. Who am I to argue with my grandparents? So we went. This spot is just down the street from their condo, but in the negative degree weather, we drove. In the summer though, it'd be a quick and easy walk. 

Now, it was Christmas day and they were open late. So that's a bonus on them. No one wants to be working Christmas day, let alone a late night shift. We were able to get a table really easily, given at how slow the restaurant was. Right when we sat down we decided to do the AYCE option. 

This AYCE style restaurant is the most modern I've been to. Instead of writing down what you want, you use an iPad to keep track of the dishes you want and send them through to the kitchen. This is SO much more helpful because 1) there are photos so you can see what you're going to get, 2) there are descriptions of each dish, 3) the power is in your hands, which makes it 10x easier to order. 

For the table, we ordered about 6 or 7 different sushi rolls, udon, a variety of tempuras, edamame, miso soup and more. I can't even remember half the sushi we got, but all of them tasted delicious. This sushi snob was very impressed! 

Beware though: their dinner menu serves up a lot of delicious options and it being our first time using the iPad, ordered WAY more than our table could eat. It being Christmas Day, the owner happily gave us a box to take home all of our leftover sushi. More bonus points, since that is something that AYCE restaurants normally don't do. 

If you're looking for some delicious AYCE sushi in Brampton, check this spot out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. If you want affordable ayce sushi with a wide variety En Sushi is the spot. My family and I always come here whenever we crave. 

Favourites include the Mexican and vocan roll"}
{"text":"I came here pretty often back during my high school days when this was still Hockey Sushi. I thought it was the best sushi restaurant ever until I tried out other sushi restaurants and never came back for Hockey Sushi haha. 

I was excited when I found out that Hockey Sushi was no more, and EN Sushi took over. Being an extreme sushi fan, I had to try. 

This may be another go-to Sushi for me in the Brampton area! Sushi is a lot more fresh, servers are a lot more pleasant and food came out fairly quickly. 

I came on a Wednesday night and there were at least 4 other tables... and 1 server but she still managed to have everyone seated, got their drinks and served everyone's food on time so props to this server! 

I wish they had more dessert menu options, for $24.99 per person on a weekday Id expect more than just ice cream and mousse cake. I guess they kind of compensated for this by including drinks into the AYCE price! 

I recommend to give EN SUSHI a try if you're in the area! Especially if you didn't like Hockey Sushi, EN sushi will definitely change your mind about this location!"}
{"text":"This is where the old Hockey Sushi used to be and I actually really liked the old business so was surprised when my dad suggested this place. It was his birthday so we decided to take him out. Note, it is only free birthday dinner if you come in a group of four or more. 

They use tablet style ordering which I liked because you don't have to wait around for the server, and the menu has pictures of everything so my parents were able to order what they liked. 

The sushi was of decent quality. They had some premium items such as scallop but they only permitted you to order two regardless of how many people are at the table. My favourite dish of the meal was the kalbi ribs. They were so good! While there's a lot of options for all you can eat, they didn't offer anything different from any other AYCE sushi joints. Even my dad was requesting items that Hockey Sushi used to have assuming this place would serve it as well. Overall a good AYCE sushi place with great service. They do serve black sesame ice cream which is a win in my books."}
{"text":"Comparing EN to other all you can eat joints I think 4 stars is fair. It's already a vast improvement from Hockey Sushi, I was a little wary because of that but decided to trust the reviews and try it out. 

So one thing I have to say is I think it's time to take down the Christmas decorations. Other than that the place is nice and open, it hasn't changed much from before. The server let us pick a booth by the window and told us soft drinks are included in the price. I noticed they have Asahi, they still have Sapporo as well but it's nice to see Asahi on the menu.

On to the food. Miso soup was pretty standard, the gyoza were good and the tempura was really good and hot. The rolls were mostly good with fresh ingredients. Some of them weren't rolled the best and had a little less on the inside and the rice didn't completely cover the outside. But the salmon and avocado roll and California roll still tasted good. The rainbow roll and the spicy tuna were probably the best. Spicy salmon was the only one we didn't enjoy; it wasn't even spicy, just bland. 

The sashimi was next and the slices were perfectly thick. I love their selection of sashimi it's bigger than most; we ordered salmon, tuna (limit of 2 per person), albacore tuna, snapper, clam, octopus, scallop and sweet shrimp (both limit of 2). Quality was good as well and the octopus was best we've had at an ayce. 

The service was great and any hot dishes came out really hot. All in all a good experience and a good place when you're in the mood for ayce with great sashimi options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch today, and we had a great time.  He's not a big sushi eater, but the served us several dishes that he really enjoyed, which was a huge win!  Their spicy salmon sushi pizza and cheese wontons are the absolute BEST!  Those wontons were the perfect warm, delicious, and comforting delight.  The staff was also so unbelievably nice!  Not a single one of them wasn't smiling, and it brought a great energy to the place.  It was also very affordable, and I would definitely come here again for another great meal and service :) !"}
