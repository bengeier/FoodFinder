{"text":"a great place to go! the place could have been a bit more cleaner.overall it wasnt bad! i do recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good bubble tea."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea place in all of Toronto. No lie. It's actually called Wonder Bubble Tea now, and the owners are angels (a man and wife). They sell an extra large size that I can never find anywhere else (except at chatime during their big promotions), and they have sooooo many bobas and jellies to choose from. They serve vegans (with coconut milk instead of dairy milk), and they are so kind that they will educate you on any menu item you're interested in. It is a must-try if you are in the area!!!!!! Loooooove this place"}
{"text":"I literally can't stop going here. The menu is so diverse, it's not just milk tea and iced tea. They also come in a shitton of flavours (they have DURIAN!!!) and as far as bubble tea goes, it's a lot more reasonably priced than other places. The largest size is a LITRE and it's only $1.50 more than the regular size. And their selection of tapioca is also varied and amazing (mango tapioca wow).

The decor is nice, they have board games, it's clean and nicely decorated. The matrons are really pleasant and nice.

From what I've tried, everything tastes pretty great, and I can't wait to come back the next time I'm at Wonderland. Plus they have WiFi."}
{"text":"I was heading out of the city and was searching my Yelp app for a Boba treat!

Everything I found was wanting to take me closer into the \"hills\" or downtown. With some expert searching skills I found this place. 

It was an \"In and Out\" trip for me this time, but there are a few small tables and I did see a laptop in the corner so guessing they have WiFi. 

Looking at the menu board made cartoon hearts bug out of my eyes! My reaction is probably due to my small town, Manitoban naivety, but I felt like I was in Bubble Tea heaven. So many options!

Teas: Iced Tea and Milk Tea - choice of green or black tea. 
         Smoothie and Slushie frozen tea.
         Various yummy flavors for each type of tea!

Chewables: Tapioca pearls (white AND black, never seen that before...
                   COOL!) grass jelly, flavored jelly bits, aloe jelly, etc. 

My order: Green Iced Tea, Lychee flavor with tapioca pearls. Refreshing!

Drinking through a massive straw, the first sip hit me - Refreshing, lightly sweetened Lychee flavor, with a chewy surprise! The bubbles were delicious and cooked to perfection (perfect level of chewiness for this girl). I can imagine if I chose the Smoothie or Slushie versions the pearls would freeze a bit. I don't like hard bubbles, so that's why I stick to the Iced Tea/Milk Tea versions.

The mouthfeel of this drink alone gives it 5 stars. Additionally, the lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful and allowed for taste testing of the jellies before ordering! :)

I will go back again and try out more flavors and jellies. So happy to have found this place is in my neighborhood!"}
