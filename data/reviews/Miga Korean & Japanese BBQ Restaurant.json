{"text":"Having my first korean dinner after I moved to Mississauga. I ordered the beef and kimchi rice and it tasted good, the portion was big and I liked it. My friend ordered a Tofu Stew Soup, the portion and ingredients in it were abundant!  And if you checked in from Miga, you would get a free ice cream!!! 
Environment is quiet and clean, and would definitely  visit again!"}
{"text":"Best Korean & Japanese BBQ in town! Food is delicious. Never been disappointed. Also love the side dishes and soup. The waitresses are always very friendly. The restaurant is nicely designed. On the pricer end but would 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Spectacular service from our server Yun for handling a party of ten. The food here was amazing. We ordered the bbq combo 2 and the seafood pancake and it was enough to satisfy more than just three people. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff was friendly. I recommend going here ... Yun, our waiter, was looking fresh in dem jeans"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we last visited Miga. We were in the area so we figured, why not?

Reading through the big menu made me feel like the restaurant is not as simple and authentic as Arirang. There are more than 15 options for bibimbap -- chicken teriyaki included..!

One reason I love going to Korean restaurants is the side dishes and Miga does serve a few (kimchi, beansprouts, seaweed and honey-glazed potato). But I didn't like their kimchi (it was just sweet and spicy, nothing else), which meant I wasn't a big fan of their beef and kimchi bibimbap that my boyfriend decided to try. He didn't think it was anything special either.

I ordered the jam pong and the portion was big (quite comparable to Arirang). However, the first word we thought of was...salty. I had to drink some tea or have a bite of a side dish after every spoonful. But the noodles were cooked perfectly and there were a couple mussels and shrimps to enjoy with it. 

Based on their menu and our experience, the restaurant seems to tailor to a more Western palate. It's not as authentic as I thought it was and everything was too salty for our taste. (However, I can't say for sure this is the case for their BBQ items as well.)"}
{"text":"Had experienced Korean BBQ downtown once before, and really enjoyed it, but found this little gem on dundas. 

Service was excellent, restaurant was clean, with they often changed our grills to keep them from burning. All the food was fab, I was under the impression that they still had AYCE, but they do not have that anymore. However for $25 got a pretty generous serving of meats, shrimp and mushroom. (Mussels were the only thing that we didnt enjoy). Even the salad was great. The kim chi and other small starters were amazing! 

Thoroughly enjoyed this experience, was very curious about the hot stone meals that others were eating in the restaurant, will have to try that some time."}
{"text":"Very good food. A little pricy for dinner but amazing lunch deals. My husband and I enjoyed the Galbi Tang and Soft Tofu Stew, both were delicious. 

For dessert, our toddler loved the Black Sesame ice cream. I was going to take a photo of it but it tastes a lot better than it looks :)"}
{"text":"Food quality is so much better than the other Korean restaurants in Mississauga, love their BBQ, although it is a little bit pricy...still love it!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Very good service. I ordered the salmon teriyaki. It was good."}
{"text":"I read on here \"you get what you pay for\" well I did certainly , and I remained hungry .... Premium for 2 . Ordered a seafood pancake as well . The quality and atmosphere was nice . The meat was ok , nothing crazy . Very expensive . Felt ripped off . Another star would be awarded  for some extra meat , otherwise 3 for being far to expensive for such a little amount of food ."}
{"text":"Went here after searching for some help on yelp.  I've been going to chako in Richmond hill and wanted to try someplace closer to the Mississauga area. So we went here.  What a mistake. Took 20 minutes to seat us after we had a reservation. The grill runs on a little propane tank that is the size of a pop can. It went out on us twice! And the so called steak was minced up meat ends.  At least chako had full strips of steak. Best part of the night was when I asked for water after I finished my pop. Waiter pours the water in my half empty pop glass! Wow! 
Never again will I go here. Back to Chako it is, I guess you shouldn't settle for a substitute. Lesson learned. Save your 80 bucks for another place."}
{"text":"The quality of the grills is poor...they spark or go out. The staff are slow and rude and seem to focus more on certain tables than others. The manager sat on the phone for 20 minutes while staring at us while we waited to pay debit for our half eaten (no way to cook without fire) meal and because the debit machine shared the same phone line (cheap) ...we had to wait. If I want honest this would be a reason to dine and dash."}
{"text":"I had read good things about this place and thought to try it. Bad idea. The beef teriyaki was dry and looked like it had been sitting in a bus tray for a while. Sushi was okay- fresh fish and rice was fresh tasting as well. 
But like other reviewers mentioned, we left there stinking of burnt BBQ (even though we did not go the BBQ your own food option). Gross.
Service was with a smile but English comprehension was lacking. A drink order of soda took a few attempts and finally a pointing to the word in the menu. To boot, some of their pricing is misleading. So be careful. $65 for a two person dinner - no booze, is high for a place with meh food and lingering BBQ smell on my clothing.
I will not go back."}
{"text":"Miga is one of my favourite restaurants in Mississauga. The reason why is because it's one of the most consistent places for me.  I don't usually go for Korean BBQ, which is the strange thing.  On a chilly day, it's where I go for some comfort.  I love their short rib udon noodle soup. My friends always order the spicy seafood noodle soup and they love it.  The other things that is great to order is the stone pot rice.  They do a great job preparing it and have tonnes of choices.  I suggest the beef with vegetables and egg - then you can hear the nice sizzle of egg cooking in your pot and get some crispy rice.  Stone pot with kalbi beef is another favourite too.

I saw that they are opening on in Korea Town in Toronto, so hopefully it's as good."}
{"text":"Good quality cut of meat for BBQ.  Service and atmosphere is good.  Exhaust fans are loud but no worst than other Korean BBQ restaurants. Price is on the high end.  Expect to spend $50+ per head for a satisfying Korean BBQ experience.  Non-bbq dishes may be less than spectacular and overpriced.  But plenty of parking is a plus."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I got the chicken stonepot, and I was expecting it to be too spicy but to my surprise it was not that spicy and very flavourful. 

Definitely recommend it for Korean food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants. Not salty, fresh and healthy. Good for both BBQ and stone pots."}
{"text":"They do have nice decor and good services. Cant speak all their dishes as i've been there once only and I ordered the \"the seafood red soup?\",dont remember the exact name. I was disappointed that instead of making real soup stock they used the soup base powder from instant noodle(shin ramen) which full of msg.  There were plenty seafood but were the poor quality kind. I'd expect real cooking for paying $13.99, not dump in some soup base power and frozen seafood in boiled water."}
{"text":"Really solid Korean food. We usually come here for the BBQ and haven't been disappointed. It's a little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Just turst me don't go.don't waste ur money in this restaurant.it's quite pricy for this kind of restaurants?my friend ordered a Galbi short ribs it's costs $18.95 and there is just few piece of beef on the top of rice and thz all. so it's totally waste of money?and it tastes soso?"}
{"text":"What a fun evening a a different  idea for a meal. Our group of 7 ordered combo meals. We received a delicious  assortment of appetizers prior to cooking our meal on large hot plates at our table. We were very private and had time for lots of conversation.  All the food was well spiced. Service  was great. Definately  recommend"}
{"text":"Still love this place. I went back AGAIN but tried the daily special (as opposed to the regular raw beef). 

Everything here is still wonderful (service and atmosphere).

The lunch special is soo good (only $13) and I gotta say, that Kalbi beef is tender and delish!"}
{"text":"Always consistent good Korean food in Mississauga that takes Amex which is nice"}
{"text":"I'm not korean or japanese, so I have limited things to say about this place:

1 - Don't go if you're in a rush.  Their service can range from curt to courteous depending on the server you get, but the food is invariably super slow.

2 - Don't go when you're trying to be frugal.  It's not a cheap place to eat.  The best they have is \"lunch specials\" with smaller versions of their regular stone pot rice.  

3 - Dont' go when you're super hungry for Korean BBQ: it is not all you can eat Korean BBQ.  

That being said, the food is actually pretty tasty.  The korean BBQ, although expensive for limited portions, is very tender and well marinated, and they clean your grill for you periodically.  They can also help you cook it if it's not too busy and you're not sure what you're doing.

I enjoyed the experience of the private rooms (sitting on the floor while eating) and the privacy afforded.  

Their Karaoke room was less impressive (no BBQ there) and they closed way too early for any good fun.

As far as Korean goes, I'm not aware of that many options, so you make do with what you have - it's pretty good tasting, but it can be hard on the wallet."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend night for Korean BBQ.  It was an excruciatingly long and drawn out affair.  I mean, how long should it take to get plates of uncooked meat??  Probably took 45 mins from sitting down until getting the small portions.  Left unsatisfied.  I now go to arirang for Korean BBQ instead.  Much faster and better.  Also some of the appetizers have a soap/bleach taste to them at Miga.  Not pleasing"}
{"text":"This review is for an Uber Eats order.  I ordered bibimbap and found it plain and boring in comparison to other restaurants.  They also gave us a bento box instead of a side of rice for another item (I won't complain about getting extra but this mistake probably means someone else didn't get what they ordered)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of korean food, but my girlfriend is korean and I like to compromise!

I've been to a bunch of korean bbq restaurants and this one blew me away.  We had the BBQ combo with spicy pork and chicken, short ribs and bulgogi.  The marinade is so delicious!  

The kimchi there is also really tasty, and my g/f (who is a huge kimchi critic) agrees.  

Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I saw few good reviews on yelp and decided to give this a try,  nothing special.  It's average.  I would give this a 3/5 base on the food alone, but bad and slow services, and expensive food make it 2/5.  

Unless this is your only option for Korean/Japanese food, don't waste your money, drive 20 more minutes to Toronto for better ones."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 9 and they easily accommodated us without a reservation.  We were shown to the Party Room where round tables and a cool curved TV were situated.  The staff were very kind and put up with us extremely well.  The food was generally very good except the Tteokboki and Udon had no vegetables in them so it tasted a bit plain.  We ordered Sagyeopsal and Bulgogi, which we opted to cook for ourselves for a better experience.  We also ordered the Seafood Tofu Soup, and the Beef Bone as well.  

The food here is a lot pricier than one would expect, especially compared to Owls of Minerva, their tteokboki was a lot more expensive.  But judging from the ambience, this restaurant was aiming for a more elegant and luxurious experience.  

Overall, Miga is a great place to go with either a date or with your entire family.  As long as you're willing to pay for it, the experience is truly wonderful with healthy and delicious tasting food."}
{"text":"Had date night tonight at this amazing restaurant. This is my first time experiencing Korean BBQ and it was fantastic. The food was well marinated, juicy, tasty and most importantly- The servers are very attentive and love to teach you about the korean BBQ process! This is the first of many visits to this fun restaurant. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who is looking to have a tasty interactive experience! Well done Miga!"}
{"text":"After peering numerous times into the Bloor St. location, I was pleased to be brought to the Mississauga location to get a little taste of what I had been missing.

And, it's great. And this is coming from someone who avoids the downtown Korean BBQ joints like the plague (who wants to eat a red meat-only meal that all tastes the same?). However, I was thrilled to see that their grilling options extended well beyond chicken, pork and beef. Squid! Ribs! Mussels! Oyster mushrooms! And as an added bonus, the meal feels a bit more well-rounded with a choice of a giant side salad or lettuce to wrap your grilled gourmet into. The raw options are beautifully presented, and cleanliness is at it's best, with your grill tops changed after every single meat session (about 3-4 times a seating).

The atmosphere is also something that wins me over. Warm, woody, and complete with private rooms that are always bustling with laughter. And hey, the flat screen showing the NBA game is also nice (though a tad out of place). Fellow Yelpers are right in calling out the service though - while the servers are very very friendly, they are also slow. Bonus though! They kindly set up a platter of 5 different scoops of ice cream complete with candles and a song to celebrate a birthday for us. Lovely. And on the house, of course.

All in all, this was an experience that turned me from a KBBQ hater to a selective KBBQ lover. Though something not to love? The stank of barbeque that somehow lingers on your clothes for at least 3 days... more to love!"}
{"text":"So very lucky to have had the chance to visit for a solo lunch while waiting for my son to finish up at a nearby birthday party. It was freezing out so I knew I wanted something hot and spicy. Unfortunately they no longer serve my favourite spicy seafood noodle soup jjamppong (), so I opted for the equally satisfying yuk gae jang udon (spicy noodle soup with shredded beef and scallions). $14.95 came to just shy of $20 after tax and tip, but it was more than enough, especially considering the 3 free side dishes + kimchi AND free ice cream if you show your server the coupon after checking in on Yelp (valid for 4 hours after you hit the button -- hopefully you wouldn't be spending that long in the restaurant). Served by the always happy  and informative Cindy, I enjoyed my quiet time and was in and out in about 40-45 minutes, this being at lunch time on a Saturday. Bathrooms were clean and I love how their decor is minimalistic. Looking forward to more visits if this freezing weather sticks around. Also... finally an Asian restaurant that accepts American Express!"}
{"text":"Compare with most of the others Korean BBQ in Toronto , Miga the food portion was too small , the negi boneless short ribs is thin like paper and their BBQ doesn't come with a pot of soup most others does.  But their cucumber side dish is tasty ."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious! Definitely on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed with this place at all. They are not generous with the side dishes, most of the Korean places give a generous amount of food. They are also a bit more expensive. We asked for a dessert menu and they only have Haagen - dazs ice cream which is served in the same package is bought including the plastic spoon!! Service was good though."}
{"text":"Vantilation problem makes the whole place smells like a big piece of bbq beef, that's not a problem until you get into your car and get back home coz you're smelling exactlty like one. You forget that you just down however many pound of meat and bottles of beer, coz you just want to throw your laundry into an incinerator and yourself into a bubble tube. Going to Miga always involves a big cleaningmania after. It's kind of good coz you burn off the extra pounds you just put on by over indulging!!"}
{"text":"We had the all-you-can-eat option. Okay, it's not the gourmet thing to do, but no complaints. Great value for $15.95. And everything was really good.... especially the bulgogi. Staff was very nice, so give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this place for a nice quality Korean bbq that does not provide left over scrapes! We enjoy the employees that change the grill without us asking as it minimizes the burnt smell that deep into our clothes and hair! (Im not a fan of smelling like charcoal) Their gamjatang is amazing filled with ginseng and dates and I love their premium bbq combo for two! Look forward for the kimchi too! It's a sweeter recipe that they make in-house :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly service,  and on the house dumplings for our dragon boat team! Excellent food."}
{"text":"It's pretty fancy for a Korean restaurant and is one of the only ones around in my area. Like I said, it was pretty deserted except for maybe one or two tables.

I decided to order the dolsot bulgogi bibimbap , which is basically rice with bulgogi in a stone pot. It doesn't have as much sauce as bulgogi normally does but it didn't taste dry when it was mixed with the rice. Don't underestimate the size of the bowl because it definitely fills you up!

the soybean paste stew  -  It was quite flavourful and tasted very similar to what I had in Korea. Stews are always a good choice when it's cold outside!

Galbi Jim   - which are braised short ribs. Miga did a really great job of braising it and the meet was tender and came right off the bone. A small critique would be that the sauce was really sweet, maybe a little too sweet so for those who would prefer something a bit more toned down you can always mix it with the rice.

dolsot bibimbap  - It's similiar to the bulgogi bibimbap but this is the traditional version which has shredded veggies. This was pretty good but nothing extraordinary.

Miga is definitely worth trying out. I have read past reviews where they mentioned bad service but when we went, the service was quite good but again that could be a result of the crazy snowstorm we had. A good suggestion might be to go when it's not too busy such as a weekday!"}

As you know, I usually drive uptown for Korean food- few of my favorites are ChoSunOk and Piggy's but for this specific occasion, my family decided to drive west and check out Miga Restaurant. We were meeting up with somebody that lives in Missisauga so Miga seemed to be the best option. I know few of my friends who works in Missisauga that goes to Miga for group lunch and said it was pretty decent so I was looking forward to trying it out.

Due to never-ending construction on Gardiner Highway, it took me an hour to get to the restaurant from downtown and I was starving by the time I arrived.
Miga restaurant is very spacious which makes it good for group lunch/dinner occasions. It is a stand-alone restaurant which means there were plenty of parking around.

They serve regular Korean dishes as well as BBQ options so there were lots of choices to choose from. Here is what we ordered-

Ordered: Yang Nyum Galbi (Korean BBQ) 4/5

* $29.95 per order, 2 orders minimum
* Served with rice, side dishes and free soybean soup
* These are beef ribs and they were good quality
* Portions seemed just about right for 3 people
* You can cook your own meat or get the server to help you out
* Make your own lettuce wraps with all the sidedishes
* Since it is beef, it is a little pricier but I enjoyed it

Ordered: Yuk Gae Jang 3/5

* Served with a bowl of rice and side dishes for $10.95
* Personally I am not a fan of this soup but we ordered it to share
* This has lots of vegetables and pork pieces that makes it very hearty
* It's good to have on a cold day
* You can eat it with rice or put the rice into the soup and eat it like porridge

Ordered: Hae Mul Pajeon 3/5

* Korean style pancake with seafood for $17.95
* I found their seafood pancake to be pretty decent
* It wasn't too doughy which I hate
* Filled with mussels, shrimps and squid
* Dip it into soy sauce or eat it with kimchi

Ordered: Stone Pot Squid 2/5

* Rice served with spicy squid in stone pot for $12.95
* I think this was one of the worst stone pot squid I had so far
* The sauce was fine but there were maybe 5 pieces of squid, maximum
* I didn't think this was worth it for the price I paid

Summary: Overall, my lunch experience at Miga was pretty decent. Dishes were hit or miss but you should advantage of the lunch specials they offer. I would suggest this restaurant for anybody that is too lazy to travel up to North York or wants to have big group lunch/dinner at a Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with my fam for the first time and had a great meal. Decent prices and very good food. About 25 dollars per person for Korean BBQ. Not the best Korean I've ever had and not the cheapest, but quite good. Service was friendly but not exceptional. I'd go again but I think I'll look around for other places first."}
{"text":"Stone pot and the starters are much better than other restaurants. Fresh and not so salty which is great . I think the stone pot is fresh cooked. 
Will come again"}
{"text":"This used to be a very nice place but now it is run by idiots.  How does a table seated and ordered 10 min after us, ordering the same food as us, gets their first??

The initial delay aside, it was next to impossible to flag down a server to get anything.  Our food kept getting mixed up with the table beside us...not once, not twice but four times out of 6.

Chako, here I come."}
{"text":"I have traveled throughout South Korea on Business. Miga is the closest thing to S. Korean BBQ that I love!! Great for a different night out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place... BUT... Server was short tempered and rude.... Their bun-chun is sweet!!!!!  Why is it sweet????"}
{"text":"A very solid restaurant across the board.

I have to admit, I was quite amused when I walked up to the front door of this place and saw that they had a \"Recommended on Yelp\" sticker attached to the door. I felt I owed it to them to give a review in recognition of the great food and service.

I came here (as of this writing) last week to celebrate my birthday with family. We had a five-person party and were seated immediately after checking in with our reservation. The ambience is definitely nice - there's a darker restaurant with large TVs and a bar, and a separate \"party\" area with four massive tables and sliding door entry to the room.

We all had the lunch AYCE special, which I found to be very fair for the price (about $16 or so per person). We did a mix of Korean and Japanese (sushi) dishes, and it was generally on point across the board.

I can't say I'm big on the bibimbob (just a personal preference - nothing to do with the quality of the food), but everything was great. We had a couple large orders of sushi, kimchi, short ribs and seaweed salad, and the waitresses accommodated us very well (gave us extra ginger, spicy mayo, a pitcher of water). There were a couple points where food we ordered didn't come out until much later (sometimes, an hour or more after we ordered), but that's a minor gripe.

Some of the portion sizes were also small (e.g. one spring roll per AYCE order), so we had to order multiples at a time. The dessert ice cream sizes weren't anything to write home about either.

The hostess was very friendly, and was nice enough to wheel out the birthday cake we brought on a rolling tray. We ended up giving her a slice of it in appreciation.

Insofar as the \"Korean BBQ\" aspect, I can't really comment on it. There's another place I usually go to for this type of food (Chako, up at the north end of the city), but I was very impressed with Miga. I now understand why my family and friends speak so highly of it.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Solid KBBQ in Mississauga that offers traditional experience of Korean BBQ.

Miga has been around since I was in highschool, I will spare the details on how long ago that was, but lets just say, its been a while!

My friends and I came here because we were in search of some good ol \"traditional\" Korean BBQ, where you get the lettuce to wrap your meat in - different from the westernized Korean Grill House chain you'll find downtown. 

For a Saturday Night, the service was great. Our Server's name was Laurence/Lawrence. He greeted us with a smile and maintained a positive attitude throughout our service, despite a few grill hiccups we had. 

The meat was delicious, we ordered the \"recommended\" Beef BBQ Combo and added on a side of duck. Both were marinated well and the when cooked, had great flavour that you didn't really need to add more sauce to.

I was really impressed that they were generous with their appetizers, I feel like a lot of Korean places kind of give you that snare after you ask for 2 refills, but at Miga they offered once they saw our dishes were empty. The lettuce was also AYCE, without an additional charge as well. Bonus! 

Overall, Miga has great décor, great ambience. There is even a private party room area if you want to hold a large event. 

They've definitely upped their game, and I won't hesitate to come back here again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there aren't too many Korean restaurants in this area of Mississauga.  

While the meats, as expected, were delcious, the service was horrendous and the meal was expensive.  We finished all the food we had ordered, but still left hungry.

As for their Japanese food, it is also prepared well, but again very pricey compared to other local options.

Don't go to Miga if you're in a hurry or like good service.  Also: some of the servers don't speak English."}
{"text":"We had the premium bbq combo with the rib eye, bone-in rib and pork belly. The meat was really fresh and delicious. 

The only thing is that they took away their generous side dishes, which was surprising to me for a Korean restaurant, and replaced them with appetizers (one tofu, spicy cucumber and sweet potato) instead. They don't refill them unless you ask and they only really refill the kimchi unless you ask very specifically for the other stuff. I thought this was a step down from what they previously had which was a disappointment.

The service was mostly prompt for lunch time. Overall another good experience!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk in, is the inevitable smell of BBQ (surprisingly, it's not overpowering). Immediately, your stomach sinks and your hunger level triples.

Second thing that caught my eye? The GIANT curved oled TV! And with my Blue Jays game on? Okay, these guys have already earned major brownie points in my book. 

Like most, if not all, Korean places, they have a call button on every table. In addition to their private booths, Miga offers a dim, intimate-feely atmosphere - pretty hard to come by, for a table bbq place. 

Is it bad that I could munch on their cold dishes all day? 
We ordered the Premium BBQ, which came with two different types of Kalbi, some pork belly, and stewed soy bean soup. For the two of us, that was the perfect amount of food. Especially when you factor in the infinite cold dishes, rice and salad. 

The cleanliness in this restaurant was on point. Their waitstaff were super friendly - to the point where it was kind of scary. They certainly made us feel like VIPs, when we had their entire staff cooking and serving us. The only thing we had to do on our own, was put the food in our mouths. 

**** Why no 5 stars? The one and only flaw to our visit? Here's where it goes downhill. 
The staff forgot to fill the water under the grill, which led to the pot of charcoal almost popping in our faces. Luckily neither of us had our hands or faces near, when it popped with sparks. I will mention however, some of it did hit the side of my face, where it was tingling for a few minutes. Throughout the first half of the meal, I thought for sure this would be a 4 or 5 star. 
But this negligence (hopefully it was a one off), could have led to an actual burn. As apologetic as they were, they did blatantly admit one of the staff forgot to fill up the water. 
At the end of our meal, once we had turned out grill off, they were very quick to clear everything and bring us the bill - before we even asked. Not even a chance to contemplate dessert. We were very friendly and courteous, throughout the entire dinner, even after the incident (as though they were rushing us out, in case we soon discover any burns or decide to argue about the bill).

As good as the food was, I can't justify any more than 3.5 stars when you look at the entire experience as a whole. 
Good service can make up for bad food, but good food can't replace bad service."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the experience of cooking our food and trying new things. Our server was extremely helpful and answered our questions. The pork bagogi (spelling) was absolutely amazing!!! We will go back for more of the pork again!  I did feel that it was just a little bit pricy. $200 for 4 adults to eat but the different dining experience was fun and we will probably pay to do it again in the future. Just not all the time.  We left very full and very satisfied. There wasn't anything we didn't like. If you've never done, you should def give it a try."}
{"text":"The service was very good, the food was very good, though it was a little bit expensive. I would definitely return. I had the BBQ Tapas: the Beef Tongue and the grilled calamari, and the grilled mackerel off the appetizers. The ambiance is also nice, but a little drafty in the main dining area."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with my friend during our lunch break. I was very impressed by the decor because it was very fancy and intimate. We came on a weekend at around 1pm but the place was quite empty, so it was very quiet and perfect for chatting. We both ordered the bulgogi gui lunch special ($13), but I was expecting the portions to be tiny since most upscale places are like that.

I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the lunch set came with a medium sized salad and a miso soup. Along with the bulgogi itself and the full bowl of rice, the meal was definitely worth the $13. My friend and I were stuffed by the end of the meal and even had some left over, which we took home.

The banchan were fantastic. The kimchi is quite spicy in comparison to other places, but that's exactly how I prefer it. They also had cucumber kimchi, bean sprouts, and the potato side dish. Unlike other places, for the potato side dish they used a sweet glaze over it; whatever it was though, it tasted great.

Overall, very impressed with this place. The servers and staff were very professional and came to check in with us many times over the course of our meal. The food is great, portions are good, and the atmosphere is fantastic - perfect for an intimate meal between friends or lovers. The only disappointing thing about my visit was that I only had 1 hour to eat; if not, my friend and I would definitely have taken our time to enjoy our meals. I'll be coming back soon for more bulgogi."}
{"text":"I came here with a Korean friend, we all 3 members rely on her to order food, we've tried few different things which are very good! The first one is my favorite seafood pancake, then beef Bibimbap, hot tofu soup with steam rice, hot noodle soup & cold noodel soup. Basically everything wonerful, except the hot noodle soup is too hot for us, I could finish a small portion with all tears & nose running but one of my friend just had a bite then given up. Their service was good as we went early at 5pm, their staff keep coming to refill our tea, get extra chopsticks, collect dishes... and take photo for us lol"}
{"text":"I live in North Korea town in North York, and have sampled all the bbq joints here. 

Miga is by far, superior to all the places around my area, and this review is based on taste alone (my relatives paid for the meal and I didn't even see the menu hah).

Tasted: 

Saeng Galbi - if its frozen you wouldn't be able to tell. Marbling was impeccable (and that's not even a word i use! I just have to here!). Melts and pairs extremely well with the dwaenjang Chigae!

Seafood Pancake - not heavy at all, crisp and perfect blend of squid, green onion, etc. No overpowering tastes. perfection.

Dwaenjang Chigae - so rich and flavorful. i love dwaenjang Chigae and its one of my go-to dishes so I was impressed. Not too salty or lacking in dwaenjang. 

Bonus points for:

- Incredibly fresh kimchi that is seasoned with raw oyster (my kind of kimchi). Not overly fermented. addicting.

- Huge parking space and clean interior 

- Attentive wait staff, fresh lettuce, ingredients

- classic traditional korean side dishes that are seasoned extremely well. Summer kimchi game on point!


Of note: The dwaenjang isn't as rich as I'd hoped for when using with the meat/lettuce, but it was perfect in the Chigae (soup)! 

I am sad this isn't closer to me, but I'd travel 45-1hr for this place because it's THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars

I have eaten at Miga many times only to take advantage of their lunch special. As they have been operating beside their competitor \"Sushi 168\", Miga had to restructure how they would maintain and attract new customers.

Walking into the front lobby is a small but very welcoming waiting area. On a busy day they do not have enough chairs so unless you are very patient, expect to stand for a considerable amount of time. Come wintertime, be warned that you will freeze from standing too close to the door opening from time to time.

The inside is quite grand and a little dark. You'll be lucky to be seated next to a window and there aren't that many throughout the place. They offer the usual choices of Korean entrées with the option of grilling your own food (which I absolutely do not like doing at any restaurant. Yes, I will write a blog about this one day). The biggest setback is they do not serve the almighty GamJaTang - Pork Bone Soup so if you're looking for it here then turn right back around and drive away.

The biggest attraction is their $17.99 lunch special combo which consists of Galbi (I spell it Kalbi) and Naeng Myon. Their Galbi is seasoned very well and taste just how it should be. Their Naeng Myon comes in a big fat bowl full of noodles with veggie garnish and beef slices. Add in the right amount of vinegar and hot mustard and you have yourself a delicious meal.

The service is off and on and I have yet to determine when it has ever been spot on. Sometimes there is an extreme delay from when they bring out the small yet personalized banchan appetizers to when the lunch special or any other entrée comes out. There have been times when I need a refill on my water or tea and I have to keep following up with it when my table of 3 or 4 are the only ones in the restaurant. Like I said, off and on.

If you haven't been here before, this is what you need to know:
* They are pricier than most Korean restaurants in Mississauga. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit down, it has a far better ambiance than most Korean restaurants along Hurontario or Dundas street in Mississauga.
* Book a reservation if you can. Weekends are the busiest.
* Get that $17.99 lunch special. Even if you can't finish it, it's a really nice fulfilling meal.

{"text":"One of our favourite Korean restaurants. Great and polite service. There is a button if you need to call the server. They came right away. Place is clean.Food is good quality. Korean owned. Kids loved it! Have the choice of BBQ table or regular. Even have traditional Japanese tables sitting on the floor. But no bento boxes for dinner. Price is moderate to pricey."}
{"text":"First Korean BBQ experience and I believe we now have a very high benchmark after visiting MIGA.. the atmosphere, service and food is outstanding! Cindy was not only attentive and quick but also friendly with us and the children in the group.. she made sure everyone was having a great time! 
We will come back for sure and recommend  you pay a visit as well!"}
{"text":"A solid, high quality Korean restaurant. Excellent panchan, prompt and courteous service. Great kimchi. I have lived in Seoul and also in California and know Korean food pretty well.

Classy décor and presentation of the food; this is not one of those mom and pop joints. There are some Korean style rooms where you take your shoes off. These are equipped with special chairs with backs ( not just cushions) so they are comfortable 

Sure, you can find cheaper ( and lower quality) Korean food in the GTA. But if you are looking for a nice place to take your family or to go on a date, Miga can't be beat. We are always happy after we eat there----"}
{"text":"Sadly this place was not an all you can eat. Found the food great but pricier for the BBQ portion.  Enjoy this place with a lover or friend as long as they have a wallet, cause you forgot yours...

Enjoy or not, it's your call."}
{"text":"Service is great, attentive. 
Food quality is between okay and good.
We ordered the marinated combo and instant regret!! The marinade was so sweet that it overpowered the meat - wouldn't recommend this unless you like candied meat. 
For what it was however, definitely over priced $$$
140$ for 2 with BBQ, soup and 1 app... no drinks no dessert 
Would not return solely because there are similar places at much more reasonable prices only a few miles away"}
{"text":"When I want good Korean in Mississauga  / Oakville this is the ONLY place that does it right.

The food is top notch.  We have had the Korean bbq as well as the traditional Koran food such as seafood pancake and the spicy jam pong soup.  You also get banchan with your meal.

The inconsistent variable is the service.  It ranges from friendly and attentive to outright neglect.  There is a  button you ring to get service.  The last few times the service was good and I hope the trend continues.  The quality of the food here is far better than the AYCE Japanese /Chinese/Thai next door yet it's never as busy... If you want quality over quantity come here instead..."}
{"text":"4.5, rounding up to a 5. Comfortable large space with soft music in the background, good for large groups or small. Service was great, and they gave us all delicious fried dumplings on the house. Roasted tea is yums too!

For me, the apps (small dishes) at Korean restaurants are really important, and Miga's apps are awesome. My favourite is the seaweed. Although I've enjoyed the kimchi dish more elsewhere, and the potato one was a bit too goopy for my liking. 

Ordered the kimchi pancake, and was surprised to find that it had octopus in it. It comes on a wooden table platter, piping hot. Loved it.

I got the raw beef bibimbap as my main. I stirred the beef around and it took a while for it to cook (it also shrunk so I think you end up getting less beef than if you order the pre-cooked one). Next time I'll probably stick with the cooked beef one so that I also don't have to wait for it to cook! The crunchy rice parts from the sides of the bowl were the best part.

Tried a bit of the spicy soon tofu, and the flavour was really good. 

All in all, really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of more hit and miss. 

Great food, casual ambience and ok tea.

The service was horrible - they completely forgot about us for over an hour. Once our plates were cleared - we waited for about another half an hour before we got our bill. 

The food was way better than I expected. The Galbi tang was tender, the broth was flavourful and the noddles were chewy. 

The seafood pancake should be renamed as green onion pancake because that's all. YOU tasted. 

The banchan was yummy!"}
{"text":"So I was shopping at the prime outlet mall nearby with my girlfriend. She was feeling Korean food so I went on trusty yelp to find a good place in sauga. Lo and behold, stumbled upon this place. Strangely somehow all the waiters/waitresses are attractive here. *Chuckles* Anyways, buzzer at every table to call for service. Kinda expensive. If you're looking for a smaller budget meal this place is definitely not it. What else. Hmmmmmm, the food was quite good. Place was kind of empty when we arrived prolly cuz the lunch rush was finished already. Bigggggg TV spotted on the wall playing sports. Wanted to try the premium bbq platter but opted for the set combos instead. Kimchi here is the homemade sort. Not store bought. Am I down to return sometime in the future? Sure."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Selection was poor, service was slow and the price was too high for the mediocre quality and quantity of food. Even the side dishes were lack lustre."}
{"text":"This is a decent korean/japanese bbq restaurant.  You pay more for the decor of the restaurant and get less food.  Lots of other korean restaurants that give you more bang for your buck.  Presentation is really nice though.  service was good.  Food quality and taste is very good.  That being said...if you want real kalbi just find yourself a Korean friend and get invited to the summer backyard bbq's and anyone who claims that PC korean bbq sauce tastes the same should not be trusted!"}
{"text":"One word: Excellent!


This place is crazy good. We came here on a Sunday. The seating was great. It wasn't so busy. We ordered the marinated combo. We were not disappointed at all. The food was absolutely great, especially with the BBQ sauce that they provide us. Our waitress was very friendly and gave us 2 Ice cream when we redeem the Yelp Check-in coupon (Thanks Yelp! Love ya!). She provide us with some info we were curious about. The conversation between us was friendly. She was very humorous when it came to joking. The ice cream was great. It was vanilla with hints of sweetness. It was one of the best ice cream I've ever eaten.
The pricing is slightly expensive. It was $50 for one Marinated Combo.

What to try:

The Marinated Combo - $50."}
{"text":"I'm torn on how to rate this place.....

Service: 3/5
-Walk in, friendly greeting, and seated promptly
-For some reason, was only given a regular menu
-Had to wait 7 minutes before I could ask anyone anything for either water or about the all you can eat menu.  At a minimum, I expect to be served water right away or have a waitress/waiter come to you in 2-3 minutes. I was ready to walk at this point, but I didn't feel like going back to work, so I stayed. 
-After I finally got a waiter, he was nice and provided good service.  

Food 3.5/5
-Didn't order off the all you can eat menu and just had the stone pot rice with beef and kimchi and spicy salmon
-Spicy salmon was fresh, but not delicious.  Average.  
-Beef with kimchi in stone pot rice - they aren't kidding when they say it' HOT!!! Careful with your arms and hands or you will burn yourself.  This was full of meat and kimchi and the rice was cooked perfectly.  Very good
-Banchan (side dishes) included kimchi, mung beans, zucchini with some kind of red pepper and miso soup.  Best was the kimchi, it, wasn't hot and spicy, but it was tasty, like a sour hot.  
Worst was the miso soup - too salty (I find that of all Korean places).  

Decor:3.5/5
-Very relaxing and would be zen like if there were less people.  Seems nice and clean.

Okay, after writing all this, probably would give this place a 3.5/5 and I'll just round up to 4 because I was in a grumpy mood after being stuck in traffic lol."}
{"text":"This review is a mixed bag, very much like the restaurant itself. 

We were seated by a young guy who seemed to be a trainee. He dropped off two glasses of cold water and didn't ask if we wanted any other drinks. We had to stop him to ask for other beverages and then ask another server for tea.  After he left, another gentlemen dropped by our table to answer our questions. And finally we got Cindy for the remainder of our meal.  She was very friendly, attentive, dropped off the dishes with a smile and cleared off empty dishes very quickly.  Cindy was excellent!

We had the all you can eat menu.  Which turned out to be a bad idea. It was very limited (no sashimi or nigiri and very few maki rolls). Also, $27 for dinner is pretty steep for AYCE.   Especially since there are several options in the area (including right next door). Note to self: Stick to the a la carte menu. 

I know this restaurant is advertised as Korean/Japanese but I'm not sure why they bother with the Japanese. It is definitely not their strength. Actually, it drags them down. Seriously, just stick with the Korean. That was evident with our meal. The Korean meat dishes: galbi (beef short rib), bulgogi (marinated beef), spicy noodle with beef and spicy pork - were delicious!  The Japanese dishes were another story: calamari (dreadful in appearance and taste), spicy salmon rolls (meh), tempura shrimp (half the size of any tempura shrimp I've had in any other sushi restaurant) and absolutely no sashimi or nigiri. 

So, if I were reviewing just the Korean dishes - 4 stars. For the Japanese - 2 stars. Thus, the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Interesting place to visit and had been on my to do list for a while. The food we tried were all very good quality (we had 3 dishes) but some oddities; like no pork bone soup? At a Korean restaurant? Decor is nice but looks fairly old. Place was very busy tonight (which is what I am equating the subpar service too, as most people rave about good servers here). The other thing is prices are rather high compared to what I am used to seeing. Probably as it has no local rivals nothing to keep them in check (and cost of gas being what it is not worth driving further). I ate a Bipbimbap with beef & kimchi which was served piping hot and was delicious. Would definitely repeat here."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Miga tonight with a friend to celebrate his engagement! He suggested we go to a place near by his place he'd been wanting to try out for a while. We both had soon tofu and it was just amazing!! Really good food and really good service!"}
{"text":"The BBQ meat is pretty nice, the meat is fresh and sauce dlicious, including pork and beef. However, the amount of meat is little, it says it's enough for 2 but in fact it's not. I suggest go during lunch as it only has all you can eat during lunch."}
{"text":"Whenever my Korean coworker and I are on a gig together, I drag him to the nearest Korean BBQ that looks interesting, and we weren't the least disappointed in Miga.

We were seated quickly, our server was very cool, and we got our marinated meat in short order and started cooking.  The barbecues here are set down into the table and flat-topped, so no giant metal mound blocking conversation at the table.  The servers brought out a knob of pork fat and greased the surface for us.  Then we started grilling our goods.

The tastes were very fine, with the spicy pork and chicken competing for first place.  The side dishes, small as the portions were, were still very tasty.  The lettuce leaves we were given to make chicken rolls were fresh and crispy and just right for the task.  As the barbecues became charred, the servers swapped them out repeatedly for fresh ones and even re-greased the surface for us.

While we didn't quite finish our bottle of Soju (GUNBAE!!), we left stuffed and happy and maybe crushing just a little bit on our waitress haha."}
{"text":"Agree with one of the reviews- hit or miss

Before when I went with my Korean friend who ordered in Korean, we got fast attentive service but when I went with my bf and we ordered in English we got poor service. 

We ordered the premium combo
+ good quality meat
+ server cut and placed our meat on the grill
- small portions, was expecting a bit more for $60
- had to ask for lettuce, garlic and Sam jjang for kbbq (are these not fundamental kbbq condiments?)
- asked for our soup and rice and didn't come until we finished our food

Not very pleased since it was my bf's first time at miga!"}
{"text":"OTHER THAN THE COMPLETELY CRAZY PORTION AND PRICE OF TWO SCOOP ICE CREAM DESSERT THE SIZE OF EYEBALLS...  everything else was great :D

I totally was not expecting a Korean restaurant here. I punched Asian Restaurants into my Garmin and got routed to two places, one that was non existent, and another that was a take out place. And when we were routing to our third I saw this and pulled in. My counterpart having been in UTM since September had not had any Korean food and was craving it. Although she had Japanese :)

She had Donkatsu, and I had the LA Galbi (short ribs) and both were pretty fantabulous. That's my new favorite word. Fantabulous. They came with a wonderful fresh spring salad that could have been dressed a little lighter. And with the regular sides, there was a bean sprout dish, a spinach dish, radish kimchi, cabbage kimchi, seaweed something and one other thing I forget what it was. Everything tasted good. (Except for the donkatsu sauce... but I wouldn't expect a great donkatsu sauce from a restaurant that does this many things. 

They have free wifi and apparently 'people love us on yelp' (a sticker on the front door). I personally was very grateful for the free wifi which is not common in Korean restaurants, or any Asian restaurant for that matter (I think) but being from the USA and not being able to access the internet without incurring ridiculous charges, I grateful for it. (That sentence was weird). 

Anyways, this place is aces. The dessert while tasting pretty good, (I don't think they can take credit for that since it's probably purchased ice cream) SUCKED!"}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying that I have been here more than a handful of times and when I was here this past Saturday it was by far one of the worst experiences I have had there.  I'm not sure if they went u see new management, but they no longer sell sushi and the wait stuff are not very attentive.  The only reason why I am even giving two stars is because the food was good.

When we arrived it was past the lunch hour rush.  It took a few minutes for someone to even notice we were at the door and to seat us.  We ordered BBQ combo #1 which included two rice, two miso soup, salad or Korean lettuce to wrap your meat, la short ribs, bulgogi, spicy chicken and spicy pork.  

They started by bringing out the side dishes that were served in an aesthetically pleasing serving plates for each individual which included mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, fish cakes and kimchi.  Everything was delicious except for the kimchi which was not fermented and you could taste the fishiness.  After that we waited and waited and finally asked when we would be getting our food.  Considering the fact that we BBQ it ourselves I didn't get why it took so long.

When the meat finally came out the portions were very small as it says it's enough for two it really isn't.  Once they started up the BBQ I asked if we were going to get the salad which they forgot about and they brought it out.  It was basically just the Korean lettuce haphazardly pulled apart and some dressing tossed on.  Very poor effort I would say.  Once we started bbqing they were not quick to change our grill and the level of service was just horrible.

Bottom line is unless you want to pay an exorbitant amount of money and receive very little probably not the best place to go.  The service was severely lacking and would hate to see it when it is busy."}
{"text":"great korean bbq.  especially liked the spicy chicken.  service was adequate.  quite expensive."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Korean BBQ, so I had a pretty open mind coming in and wasn't sure what to expect. I came here with my boyfriend and his buddy after work, and it was pretty empty for a Saturday night - we were seated instantly. The staff were all insanely friendly and helpful, if something wasn't right they would immediately bring out something else. No shenanigans!

I think this place is great to come with a group, since it is pretty pricey for only one person and they give you a lot of meat. We got the Saturday special for around $65, and it was plenty for 3-4 people. It came with beef short ribs and beef bulgogi. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the short rib, it was a bit too chewy for me and made me uncomfortable. The guys loved it though. My favorite was the bulgogi beef, so so tender and juicy. No nonsense of having to cut up the meat with scissors, just fry and eat. Their marinade is on point as well. So. Freaking. Yummy. 

Also ordered a side of tempura vegetables, as is tradition for me. They were perfection, 10/10. Very crispy and not soggy at all (common that the veggies are overcooked!). The sauce wasn't too special though, definitely had better before. 

All in all, it was a great experience for me and I can't wait to try more K-BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly authentic Korean food restaurant.   The marinade for the Kbbq is fantastic. There are many K restaurants with kbbq marinade that tastes like sauce you bought from K market. And this place definitely knows how to make qualify Kbbq.  Only real issue with this restaurant is the high cost of dishes.  I would try to go for lunch specials.  Otherwise, if you go for dinner, you probably end up paying 6 to 7 dollars more for the same dishes."}
{"text":"I went with a couple of friends today. We ordered quite a bit of food and although I can't quite remember much, the miso soup we had with our order was pretty nice, but that was about it.

The ambiance of the place was very nice, it seemed very intimate with small tables seated around the restaurant.

I ordered the takoyaki and was pleasantly surprised by the flavours, though I have had better. So in this area it did fall short for me.

When it came to the barbeque portion of our meal, our server had changed our grill more than 3 times throughout the course of it without asking us if we would like to change it, so huge points for that.

Where they lose points though, would be in the food. Nothing quite sticks out, and the flavours appear to be all the same to me. I will say this much though: don't get me wrong, I enjoy Korean barbeque as much as anyone else, but it sort of felt like it was hit and miss here.

All in all, it was a half decent meal. However, points were lost due to our server being keen on receiving a tip for things they weren't asked to do in the first place. It's a really nice looking restaurant, but I don't appreciate being asked to tip, it should come from the service alone."}
{"text":"Ran errand close by and I had the cold buckwheat noodles (Naeng Myon) craving so we decided to come here for dinner. Fiancé was going to just get a bibimbap but ended up ordering the premium combo for 2 after watching our next table bbq-ing pork belly  The combo comes with prime ribeye, short ribs & pork belly. It also comes with rice & soybean stew and you have a choice of either a lettuce salad or just lettuce leaves. We ended up having both because the waitress brought out the wrong one to us at first (more veggies for us!!)
?
The quality of meat here is not bad but you have to be careful not to overcook the beef as it is on the leaner side. Fiancé said the beef was a bit chewy but it was fine for me (he is older so he must has weaker teeth than me )
?
I got the chilled broth for my cold buckwheat noodles (you have the option to get it in spicy paste). Tasted especially good because it cooled down all the heat from eating the bbq meat. Craving satisfied"}
{"text":"Definitely a lot more Korean than Japanese. They have a wide range of Korean dishes and only basic Japanese dishes (tempura, teriyaki, some sushi rolls). 

They offer a variety of dining options - table cooking, all you can eat, and a la carte. My group went with the a la carte style as they had over 20 lunch specials at a decent price ($11-15). 

I chose to order the raw beef in a stone pot with multigrain rice. Everything was quite tasty, though the size of the serving of beef was a little on the small side. There was a lot of food though, as by the end of the meal I was stuffed. Solid meal for $13. 

The service was great. Like most Korean/Japanese restaurants, they have a button you can press to ask for service, but we never had to use it as there were an abundance of servers walking around, ready to help with whatever was necessary. My group all felt a feeling of genuine niceness from the servers.

The non-lunch specials are more expensive than the average Korean/Japanese restaurant, but nothing that breaks the bank.

Lastly, the interior. It's well decorated, with a dark, intimate vibe. They have a large curved LCD TV - my first time seeing one in a restaurant. They have different styles of rooms - even one room where you can try seiza (the traditional Japanese sitting style). It's very difficult though, haha. 

Miga is very good at what it does. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Really nice combination of post modern industrial design in a Koran BBQ restaurant.  Food was very fresh, the grilled were changed regularly for us, very clean as well.   

Top notch and friendly service they are so patient and quick.    Try this place I'll be back."}
{"text":"Premium combo for two. Lunch special $59.99. 
Been here three times. Never fails to impress. 
This time we went big. The server cooks the AAA beef for you so NO MISTAKESSSS. 

WILL GO BACK SOON."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic korean BBQ.  Our waitress was very friendly and explains everything and how to eat.  Excellent service all around.  Will be back soon to try other food in the menu."}
{"text":"I have no idea how people can write good things about this restaurant anymore. I'm pretty shocked at how people really don't know what Korean food/bbq is supposed to be like. I used to come here often years ago when they had just opened. High quality food, service on point, and the owner lady was nice. 

The owner lady was nowhere to be seen and there was only 1 Korean customer and that was me. That's when I should've flagged it but gave it a chance.. Everything tasted so horrible that I felt embarrassed bringing my bf here. We were both super disappointed and he's not even Korean! 

The food was mediocre with thinly sliced frozen meat with side dishes seasoned with no depth but MSG. It's really sad to return after years of being away to THIS. I wouldn't eat here even if it was free."}
{"text":"From east of the Don to Mississauga, the whole fam-damily made the trek to Miga this weekend. 

Firstly, I have been spoiled by an amazing mother-in-law who can cook any Ajuma under the table. Seriously, do not mess with her. She can grill kalbi like a pro. So in that context, Miga was a bit of a letdown. 

I'm not sure how long the place has been around but it seems relatively new. My question is; why go with brown tiles for everything? It looks like a tricked out Arby's and the dim lighting doesn't help either. 

But the meat was great. All marinated and non-marinated beef was plentiful and served quickly.  The cubes of fat to grease the grill never run out either.The servers refill the propane tank with one arm and the banchan with the other. The Duk Mandu was great but not amazing.  

The mandu was the best I've had anywhere in the GTA. Almost crunchy outside and marinated just enough without a trace of grease, they were perfection and the reason for the 4 stars. 

But it's really about the service here. The servers were kind enough to turn off the fans when our little guy had an apoplectic screaming fit, so props there. 

Irony of ironies, as we were paying the bill, they mentioned they just opened a location on Bloor Street that week. Hardee har!"}
{"text":"Well, well well, who knew about this little gem of a place in the neighborhood.  After reading a ton of reviews, this place came highly recommended across a few website and review site.    The service was great, food didn't disappoint. We arrived and didn't know you could reserve, they said 1/2 hour wait, 5 minutes and we were seated.   I wanted the BBQ grill, but my company wanted the stone pot dinner. Went with it. I had the spicy pork and she had the spicy chicken.   Both of them were delicious.  Miso soup to start though.  Jennifer was our sever and explained everything, she was quite nice and patient on top of it. Top it all off, Saporo on tap!!!   Definitely going back for the BBQ grill."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The waitress was rude and the food was way to expensive. One family meal was $175. I would recommend not going as the workers would sometimes look pissed even though you've done nothing wrong and talk about you with other workers. The food was ok, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Eat the meat
Can't be beat
Soft and tender
Full of taste but slender
Perfect for a date
But expect to pay a high rate
Not cheap but its a treat
This place is for Canadians, food has no heat

Any of their meat dishes have superb meat."}
{"text":"Amazing food along with delightful and attentive staff. Our Korean BBQ variety was perfect and we (7 of us) all enjoyed the differient flavours and how they blended so deliciously. The private room offered us even more atmosphere with its sunken table base... plus privacy! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I get Bibimbap cravings. Not regular old Bibimbap but Dolsot Bibimbap. There's something about that searing hot stone pot and the mixture of rice, beef, vegetables, gochujang (chili pepper paste) and a raw egg that instantly screams comfort food. 

For me, there's a delicate balance between all the ingredients. Too much rice? You don't get a good mix in a spoonful. Stone pot not hot enough? The rice doesn't get that nice crunch. Too much vegetable not enough beef? It lacks the 3rd dimension of flavour. If a place can master this tricky balance, I become a frequent visitor.

Miga not only gets this balance right, they also have a variety of Dolsot Bibimbaps. They have over a dozen different offerings but my favourite is Stone Pot Rice Mixed with Beef & Mushroom. They use Kalbi/Galbi (short rib) meat and it's so tender and flavourful. Another good one is the Stone Pot with Spicy Chicken. 

What Miga is famous for is their Korean BBQ. It's definitely a step up from the other Korean Grill Houses known for the all-you-can-eat option. The quality of their meat and seafood is better and the servings are generous enough that you won't miss the all-you-can-eat. 

They're great for groups and if you want to experience Korean BBQ solo or as a couple, even the small tables have BBQ grills. 

I don't need a reason to go to Miga but I'm glad I do."}
{"text":"My long wait for a great authentic Korean BBQ place is finally over!

Just thinking about Miga makes me want to go back, NOW!  

They have $10 (including tax) take out meals that are just to die for also if you pay cash free miso soup! Comes with rice and traditional Korean side dishes and a choice of meat either chicken, pork, spare ribs, and BBQ beef. Great for lunch or dinner.

That's just the icing on top of the cake. Great place for dine in. If you want to do traditional Korean BBQ may I recommend meal # 1. You get 4 different meats (chicken, pork, spare ribs, and BBQ beef) you get a side of Korean BBQ sauce. To start you get a delicious salad, miso soup and unlimited traditional Korean sides i.e teriyaki potatoes, kimchi, bean sprouts, collard greens, and of course steamed rice. This accompanied by a bottle of Asahi Japan's # 1 beer is one heck of a meal!

Not in the mood for Korean BBQ? Try their Bi Bim bap or any of their hot rice bowls. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet Korean restaurant that offers tabletop cooking as well as a wide variety of dishes. We were immediately greeted,seated, and served a pot of tea for  a Sunday lunch. I got the dolsot bibimbap with beef and veggies. It came with 3 side dishes and a small bowl of soup. The soup was kind of too salty but meh, it's ok. 

The bibimbap itself was awesome. It's basically rice (with a hint of sesame flavour) with different cooked veggies and marinated beef on top served in an extremely hot stone pot. All the bibimbaps come with a raw egg on top (which kiiind of cooks since the dish is so hot) but I didn't want it raw at all, so I asked the waitress if it's possible to have it cooked. She said sure, but it costs a whopping $2. Uhhhh.... so I just asked to have the egg out of my dish. Also, one of the veggies is shiitake mushrooms (which I enjoyed) but it does have a distinct flavour that may not agree with some. 

The best part of bibimbap is that the dish stays hot until you finish it. And the rice at the very bottom of the stone bowl turns into a crispy, cracker-like texture with a unique flavour (called nooroongji) which some people can't get enough of."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with kbbq, and let me tell you, I am coming back again. 

I do not remember out server's name, but she helped us a lot with our experience (esp since she knew that it was our first time). It was empty when we walked in, and so she helped us a lot, but once it started to get busier, she wasn't around as much, and tbh I wouldn't really blame her for that.  

We ordered the marinated meat for 2 people, and it was a little more on the price?y side, but it was so so SOOO worth it. 

You know I'm coming back again."}
{"text":"KALBI KALBI KALBI!

I've been on a mission lately to find the best Korean restaurant in Sauga. This would be the third restaurant I've been to in the past two weeks. 

Came here during lunch, first impression, there was no one there? uhuh, did I miss something here? Fortunately that changed throughout our stay as the place kinda got filled, which still had me a lil worried. The place is pretty sweet with both private and regular seating, all the tables have the bbq grill in the middle, and I like the dark tones that they used with the furniture, fixtures, and decor. O and can't forget the T.V monitor with the golf channel on. Korean's love their golf! So do I!

Taking a look at the menu they now have AYCE for both lunch and dinner. The only difference is you don't cook it yourself they bring the food to you. So you get your BBQ meats, chicken, kalbi, pork, and bulgogi. Some options for sushi, apps, and stone pot dishes. The regular menu is pretty big as well with combo meals going for $15-$20, stone pots $12-$15 and sushi from $5-$20. The one nice thing about their menu was they have family combos for a set price ranging from $60-$90 depending on the amount of food you want. 

So after contemplating we settled for the AYCE, b/c that would give us the best variety of the food they had to offer. Standouts, was the BBQ meat, the meat was very tasty and well marinated, and so so tender. It was not hard to chew at all and easy tear through. Out of all the meats the Kalbi and Spicy Chicken was the bomb. Sushi, was not a fan of, the rice was very good, but there was a lot of it, and the seaweed was not fresh kinda tasted stale, also the fish that they used was brutal, the one salmon roll we had for some reason just didn't taste right. For the apps, the udon with beef was very good, I loved the sauce that they used, and I normally do not like sauce. But my favorite item was the Korean Pancake, it was so tasty and it definitely hit the spot. For those that don't know what it is, its basically kinda like and egg roll, however it's flat with veggies and shaped like a pancake lol.

Good experience, the waitresses were very nice and loved to smile, they even tried to teach me how to order in Korean, b/c when I walked in I said hello and how are you in Korean. I like how the AYCE didn't have a big menu, and the BBQ meats is a of great quality.    

Items to definitely get:

- Kalbi
- Spicy Chicken
- Korean Pancake
- Udon with Beef"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Ordered the stone pot beef and veg bibimbap .... It was off the hook delicious.  I've had bibimbap at other places, but the stone pot method was by far the best. Not greasy, lots of flavour, crunchy rice at the bottom added great texture.  The small tray of complimentary apps and a side of kimchi was a perfect touch too.

The service was very quick but not rushed.  Polite and very welcoming.  An amazing treat!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent meat with not too much fat, and large portions. Pretty light on the seafood though. Service was friendly, slow towards the end. Reasonable value, on the pricey side for Korean BBQ but worth the cost."}
{"text":"This place always serves A+ quality food! Today we came back again and were met with warm service, great food, and a pleasant atmosphere. They even have a tapas menu now! We went for the share plates and the entrees and were definitely not disappointed. 


Kimchi Pancake - way better than your average pancake, but definitely inferior to their seafood pancake. When I go back (yet again) I will definitely opt for the other one (4/5)

Galbi Stone Bowl - Tasty! Wait a bit and let that rice crisp up on the bottom, you won't regret it... Unless you wait too long and it burns #itakenoresponsibility (4.2/5)

Mul Naengmyun - Cold buckwheat noodles in a chilled beef broth; BEST BOWL IN TOWN. Do not go elsewhere. This is your best and final destination, your search is hereby over. (You're welcome). (5/5)

Japchae - sweet potato noodles with veggies and meat; was quite heavy and a tad bit too oily, but very flavourful nonetheless (3.5/5)

I still feel so blessed, as a Mississaugan (?), to have this restaurant in our midst. It is so good and so consistent... It keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and it was great. Starters were yummy and Korean BBQ was delicious. Our grill was smoking  so much that they had to change it for us, but we didn't even have to ask. Servers were really nice and when he heard it was my birthday he gave my family and I melon melona bars so that was really nice of them. Classy Korean spot, would come for more special occasions!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it is amazing as always. The staff were friendly and fast and the food was great. Got the spicy pork in a stone pot and it was delicious. Would recommend this place to anybody, and will be back again. -1 star for raising the prices but I shall be back."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Loved the room we were in with the lower tables. We had a table of 8 and got some family combos with a couple entrees. Meat quality was noticeable better than other Korean bbq. You get a little less than what's typically served but I think it's worth it. We filled up on the sides too (unlimited)."}
{"text":"I have been going to Miga for the past 10 years. They are consistently good in their service, food quality and variety. Both Korean and Japanese dishes are very good and the meats and seafood are of high quality.

If you go for lunch, the specials are probably the way to go. Ordering from the regular menu gets quite expensive, and I think the main reason that the food is so good that you keep wanting to order for beef.

Like most Asian restaurants, you might find the service a bit \"hurried\" but just take you time and enjoy the dishes slowly and eventually the wait staff will adapt to your pace. The tables each have a call button for service so take your time, enjoy and just ring for service when you need it.

{"text":"The service, first of all is amazing. Like most Korean restaurants, which I highly admire.

I had high hopes going for dinner here. The restaurant is beautiful. We got seated at one of the booths, which felt private and perfect for a date night. 

It's pretty busy here on a Friday night, you'd have better luck getting a table if you aren't getting BBQ by the way!

The dinner overall was delicious - there was just one meal I wasn't fond of.

Ebi Mayo - a good starter. It's battered deep fried shrimp topped with nori and spicy mayo.

Premium Combo BBQ platter - so filling! It comes with rice, soybean stew, lettuce wrap/or salad. The meat isn't marinated, but I enjoyed it that way - since the meats also came with some flavoured oil to dip and sauce. This platter alone is enough for an entire dinner for two people.

Spicy Squid Hot Stone Rice Bowl - this disappointed me. But probably because I was expecting something a bit different? Bibimbap is one of my favourite dishes so I guess I have high expectations for it anywhere I go. All I can say is, I didn't empty the bowl and that rarely happens ?"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight on the recommendation from a Korean employee at my hotel  that I was staying at tonight.  When I arrived at the restaurant it said Japanese/Korean BBQ.  I find it funny that many Korean restaurants advertise as Japanese as well.  Since this was an AYCE place I was a little unsure how my meal would be as I did not feel like a huge meat AYCE meal.  

I ordered the Salmon Hot stone pot.  I thought it would actually come out as bibimbap but it was just a piece of grilled salmon with teriyaki sauce and rice.  It was nice a crispy but a bit overcooked for my liking (I prefer salmon just after medium rare).  Also it would have been nice with some veg.  Also I asked for a Gimbap roll (they didn't have on the menu) but she kindly did one for me.  This was nice size and good quality!  The meal came out with 4 banchan dishes (Kimchi- mild, mung bean sprouts - nice flavour, spinach- a bit salty and potato- in nice sweet sauce).  

Maybe my expectations were a little higher after just returning from Seoul last week but this meal was so - so for me!  I've had better and had worse.  I'm sure their BBQ is probably pretty good but not always do you want to go back to your hotel with meat coma!  Surely not tonight!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Korean food. We had the bibimbap and it was pretty good. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Not too authentic but GOOD enough.

Whenever I see a hybrid restaurant with its sign shining bright at the parking lot, I would turn around and drive away. I have the same impression when I saw their sign proudly displaying \"Korean & Japanese Restaurant.\" I said to myself, oh no, this is going to be another nightmare. I had no choice because I didn't pick the place.

Miga greeted us with a Chinese tea pot and pricey menu. For someone who's spoiled by super authentic Korean all you can eat restaurants in ktown DTLA, usually I don't have to think twice about what I am going to get, it's usually A, B, or C. This is NOT an AYCE place and It took us a while to go through the menu. My buddy and I ordered a BBQ combo for two, shrimp tempura, and a spicy tofu stew. Shrimp tempura was ok but the mashed reddish was missing (the white stuff you usually mix with the soy sauce), spicy tofu stew was a bit salty but still good, and last but not least the BBQ combo was just right, again, pork was a bit too salty.

It turns out to be a better than expected experience, not the best Korean BBQ experience, but if you want a little of both (Korean & Japanese), this place will not disappoint. This place feels upscale and it is not cheap. Not the place you will come with a big group, get intoxicated and eat loads of meat. Good for family or somewhat serious dinners.

Service was phenomenal. By the way, did I mention they provide mouth wash in the bathroom? Thumbs up to that! \"Honey, let's make out in the parking lot after dinner!\""}
{"text":"Stone pot lunch specials are tasty and affordable. I've tried the take out as well, it has great variety and you're getting your money's worth. Dishes are consistant. Definitely one of my Korean go-to's in sauga."}
{"text":"Honestly speaking, most Korean/Japanese restaurants offer the same variety and the food can taste slightly better or worse than other restaurants depending on whether you go on a good day or bad. 

However, Miga's my go-to place for this Korean/Japanese food because its service sets itself way above other restaurants.

First of all, the atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice because the décor and furniture in the place are soft on the eyes--making it look classy instead of tacky. Secondly, they have TVs there so you can watch games and such while you eat. But most importantly, the waiters there are so attentive and very well-trained. If you're cooking your own food, there will be a waiter there to change the BBQ tray as soon as it gets burnt. That way you know that you're not cooking your food on ashes and it's safe to eat. They have a button that you can press when you need service but all the times I've been there, I've never had to press it once because there's always been an attentive waiter. 

The second time I went there, I had the same waiter as the first time I went, and he had already recognized me and my dad. He asked us if we wanted the same order as last time or to try something new--he even remembered what we previously ordered! 

Overall, I love going to Miga and I highly recommend it due to its strong service."}
{"text":"Writeoff: Avoid this place as their food is shamefully bad.  Not sure if management has changed but the end result seems to be bad Korean food.  There are a few decent option in Mississauga but this is not one."}
{"text":"The price of this place is little bit expensive. The kimchi there is the best I have ever had. Definitely, I would recommend the the whole chicken soup."}
{"text":"We have the Marinated b.b.q. The meat were of good quality. We suspect that the Premium b.b.q. would yield better quality meat.
We were, however, disappointed with the Black Sesame Ice-cream."}
{"text":"Great place for some KBBQ! The restaurant is spacious and the service is lovely. Definitely have had better tasting beef at other KBBQ places but have always had a good experience here :)"}
{"text":"Ordered via UberEATS and it was disappointing. The meat was dry like it had been reheated. Too bad this place was vastly different when opened a decade or so ago."}
{"text":"I had the bibimbap, and I have to say it was tasty, not amazing... But tasty.  That's how I find most of the food at miga, nothing amazing, but cm dieting its one of the only Korean restaurants in the area, it's always packed."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner. Coming here on a Saturday would have you waiting at least 30mins for a table. The restaurant was packed. We booked before hand so we didn't have to wait. They gave us a semi private seating area. The room was shared with one other table. They have the traditional floor seating which is pretty unique. Probably the only restaurant in mississauga that has this. 
Shoes must be taken off when entering the floor dining area.  

We had the bbq and a few other appetizers. 
I really liked their kimchi 
The premium BBQ set was good. More on the pricy side but the meat was good. 
We ordered the spicy pork but the food came cool. I wasn't as tasty. 
Tempera wasn't crispy enough. 
Softshell crab was alright

Service is really good. The waiters are very friendly. Came by pretty often to remove the finished plates. 
Problem: there was a ventilation problem in the room. The table beside us caused so much smoke but the fan didn't collect it. So the room was really warm and smokey"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 2.5/5
Second visit to Miga. The first time was almost two years ago, where I tried their Korean BBQ and left dissatisfied. A friend recommended I go back and try their menu items from the kitchen. I ordered the Deluxe Set Lunch Box, served with rice, salad, miso soup, beef short ribs, stir fried bulgogi udon, shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura for $15 before tax. Overall an average experience.

Food: 3/5
I wouldn't recommend the Korean BBQ there. All of the meats were marinated in the same Gochujang sauce. The food is average, but the Lunch Deluxe Set are a good value for the amount of food you get. You get your typical Banchan (side dishes) of bean sprouts, spicy cucumbers, potatoes and kimchi, which is unlimited. I had the Deluxe Set Lunch Box which included salad, miso soup (which was a little over salty), 3 pieces of Galbi beef short ribs on a bed of rice, stir fried Bulgogi Udon, shrimp tempura, and vegetable tempura (which was a little under done).

Service: 2/5
Service isn't all that great. Restaurant wasn't very busy when I came late in the afternoon. My waitress hadn't come to take my order, so the owner came and did it herself. After my food arrived, I didn't see the waitress until I was ready for the bill. After finishing my meal, I sat waiting for about 10 minutes waiting for the waitress to come by so I could ask for my bill.

Atmosphere: 2/5
Not the most modern, updated restaurant. Restaurant is average in cleanliness, and somewhat dark inside. 

Tips & Recommendations
-Get the Lunch Deluxe Set = good value
-Check-in on Yelp! Free ice cream when you check in
-Plenty of parking
-Lunch Break Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"Been to Miga twice; for lunch and dinner. Celebrated my birthday here one year with a group of 12. Our tables were split up but we were close enough together to still chat. Three of us shared the BBQ style dinner combo #2 and thought that the portion was small. Of the choices offered, the bulgogi strips were the best. I ordered an additional Korean entree to share. For dessert, their black sesame ice cream was delicious!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before coming here and I thought I was going to be underwhelmed with average food at higher prices. 

Decore was nice, traditional, meaningful, and thoughtfully done. There are 3 sections of the restaurant, one for larger groups with regular tables and seats, another section for booth seating and table top grills with overhead ventilation system, and another section with seating for smaller private groups with psuedo-floor seating.

The food we ordered, Yook-Hwae and Kalbi-tang was delicious, and my wife even commented that the Kalbi-tang came in a golden bowl instead of the more traditional stone/clay pots. Apparently back in the day this was reserved for only royalty. Even the white rubber shoes (Gomushin) adds to the traditional touch. The Ban-chan was good as well, and when we left, we finished everything on the table.

This is even a baby friendly place with diaper changing station in the bathroom.

For a high-end Korean restaurant, I think this place does a very good job."}
{"text":"They have delicious Stone Bot Bibimbap but you probably want to try the BBQ combo there. Their 2 people BBQ combo is THE BEST and I just couldn't find one place that can beat Miga so far. 

Friendly and polite staff and private dinning (Family/ business or small group) available. 

If you are worried about the price, they now offer $10 lunch take out menu in-store. You will get a complimentary miso soup if you pay by cash."}
{"text":"Food here lived up to the positive reviews of Yelp.  Food here was fresh and filling.  Food prices were on par with similar surrounding restaurants. However, the 'famous stone pot' was a bit on the small side and the seafood udon was just very average. 

Will return to try their barbecue."}
{"text":"A friend came to visit from SK and his request was to try as much meat-centric eating as possible in Toronto.  Korean bbq was an obvious choice so my search led to Miga on Yelp in the GTA West.  It's safe to say that a carnivore will love this place ... with swift and pleasant service and coupled with meat quality that is quite good, it was easy to see the smile appear on my friends face.

The restaurant is easily found on Dundas and the interior is clean and spotless.  Considering the amount of grilling this place sees,  I'm impressed with the lack of residue on table tops and chairs. The overhead fans can be a bit of an annoying drone but it's not as bad as it could be.  As for the dreaded meat aroma that clings to your hair and skin for days... well, there's no escaping that.  At least your dog at home will follow your every movement... for the next week.

We had reservations and we were seated immediately.  Honestly, the service was really good ... if anything, almost exceptional compared to some of the more curt service at Cantonese restaurants.  The wait staff was always on hand to fill green tea cups and explain the finer differences between certain meat cuts of dishes.

We were wiling to try the premium bbq set but my friend saw the AYCE and zoned in for quantity.  I think it's safe to say he ate his share and more ... and every dish he tried, he was always happy with it.  Though AYCE is about quantity over quality, I will say they did have really good tasty sauces ... I don't think they skimped on quality of those.

So how did this place fare?  In his words, there's no where like this in his province and he'll dream of this place when he heads home.  The food was plentiful, flavourful, and given with a smile.  Sure, the ribs weren't 100% fall off the bone but a bit of chewing on a well seasoned and tasty piece of meat never hurt anyone.  Yes, the sirlon strips were probably not as marbled as they could be ... but considering my friend probably ate 10 oz of that alone showed that it really made him a really happy person.  All the sauces were a nice balance of savoury with heat... none of them were goopy, cloying, or too salty.  Our favourites dishes were kalbi ribs, bulgogi, the seafood pancake, grilled mackeral and bo saam.  Most of the appetizers were ok but nothing stood out.

For the AYCE price, it was a really great deal... fairly well executed food with great service.  Did I mention the service was really good? :)  Honestly, I think the service is 5 stars.  Most dishes are good (3 stars) to very good (bo saam and seafood pancake for 4 stars).  So I'll average it out to 4 stars overall.  

I think the wait staff took pity on my friend who attempted in earnest to pronounce the Korean dishes.  I'm just hoping he didn't inadvertently insult them cause I'd like to return and try the premium bbq :)"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed coming to Miga many times and always go for the BBQ at the table option.  The meats are always of excellent quality and flavour.  It would be nice if the portions were a little larger for the price, but at least they do keep bringing side dishes, rice, and lettuce as much as you want without charging more. Spicy Pork Bulgogi is our favourite but we also order both marinated and un-marinated galbi and premium steak.

One complaint that comes up nearly every time we visit is how often they want to change the BBQ grill top.  It varies by visit but often they won't let you go more than 15 minutes using the same grill.  The last time we visited, we hadn't even finished cooking our first round of meat before there was a guy at our table insisting we change the grill (like 5 minutes of cooking... we refused to let him change it).  There are three problems with this.  1) changing the grill too often means you have to wait for the grill to reheat every time (food takes longer to cook)  2) you lose the extra \"BBQ flavour\" of the meat (the caramelized sugars of the marinades) and 3) there's always someone hovering around the table.  It's just annoying and we'd be alright with changing the grill between each type of meat but lately it's constant harassment, even when we send them away.

Even though we hold off on the grill changes, the food still tastes great.  I just wish when customers expressed disinterest in this process that they would back off more."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was decently packed.  My group ordered the Spicy Pork Bulgogi and Spicy Chicken Bibimbap to share.  We also ordered a Kids' Combo for a child in our group.  Overall, the food here is really good, as the meat is perfect marinated.  Since we only ordered one portion of KBBQ, they cooked it for us and brought it out.  Everything from the banchan to the main dishes were fresh and flavourful.  I deducted one star for what seemed to be often miscommunication with the servers.  For instance, when we were asked what we would like to drink, they were told that everyone wanted tea.  The server then proceeded to bring out water for some reason.  Also, the kid wanted orange juice (which came complimentary with the Kids' Combo) but the server brought out apple juice.  It was just a few inconsistencies that resulted in the 4/5 rating.  

In terms of ambiance, the restaurant is very sleek and modern.  They used traditional cues yet executed it in a modern way.  I really enjoyed the restaurant, as it felt very upscale and luxurious.  This should be expected however, since the price here seems a little higher than other places.  

P.S.: They give out free Haagen Daz ice cream with a Yelp check in.  The man said I had to post a review first but I clarified with him that the offer was with check in only, so he shouldn't make customers obligated to review."}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre. The AYCE is expensive for what you get. Service is slow & portions are small for AYCE, so you are ordering very often. Despite the grill in the middle of the table, AYCE is cooked by the chef in the back. For the price, go to Markham and have a better, cheaper meal. Even if you factor in fuel cost."}
{"text":"wear your worst clothes coming to this place. you will smell like a burnt skewer 
The line of soups including Galbi Tang were around $13-$15 a bowl which is way overpriced if you ask anyone. from what I hear the Korean bbq is good here but I would avoid their soups. The soon dabu was bland as can be and as mentioned overpriced."}
{"text":"Service and the food here is amazing. Restaurant is clean, side dishes are always fresh and delicious- kimchi is so so good. Soon dobu, galbi and galbi tang are my favorite dishes.  -1 star for higher prices :("}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Very beautiful and elegant decor, friendly waiter and good food. We have ordered the combo : )"}
{"text":"I liked the food and it was very crowded when I went in so I know I'm not biased, but the service could use more improvement...I forgot the lady's name but she kept pointing out my friend's braces and made my friend extremely unconfortable."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years to the point where they recognize us immediately. I have to say, it is the best Korean BBQ place in Mississauga which explains why we are regulars. When we come, we never order the all you can eat. We always go a la carte. Ever since we were introduced to the more \"authentic\" Korean BBQ (the milder seasoned style) that is pretty much all we get here now. We always order the Premium BBQ combo and another BBQ dish (often beef tongue with green onions). We have a hard time finding this style of BBQ anywhere else in Mississauga. You can opt for the marinated meats but the quality of the Premium BBQ meats is really good which is why they can get away with very light seasoning.

The food is always good, the service is always attentive, and the restaurant is always nice and clean. If you come here regularly enough they give you a VIP card that gives you 10% off your Miga meals which shows they really appreciate your business (the card doesn't work with all you can eat though but we never go that route anyways)."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

If I were to eat here again, I'd go for their barbecue option because the meats are generally really fresh! However this restaurant would be considered expensive in my books for the food we get. 

I had the kalbi stone pot for my main and I wasn't too pleased with it. Yes the galbi was great, but for the price I was paying $19, I thought I can get similar meal at a different korean restaurant for a cheaper price. Just the appetizer of the galbi alone without the rice was $10 sooo does that mean I paid $9 for the additional rice?

My friends had the barbecue combo meaning they ordered meats to grill themselves. The meat looks really fresh and it was nicely plated, I'm sure they served quality meats here but I can't come to justify the price when the competition is so high out there and the food we get is nothing over mediocre at most. 

What was also a surprise to me was the menu. No Korean words at all. Err...isn't this a korean restaurant? Has it changed to only cater Westerners? It would have been nice to see the menu with some korean words to show the authenticity of the restaurant. Because the English translation of the dish may not mean anything to a korean without seeing the relevant korean name for a dish. 

LAST TIP?!

If you are to order the galbi hot pot, I suggest to order the galbi appetizer and get an order of the rice. It's cheaper. Also, the stone pots are hot so it's meant to fry the rice on the bottom of the pot a little. So if you want some crisp to your rice, I suggest you let the rice sit in the pot for a while before digging in!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. It's definitely pricier than an all you can eat place but expect to get better quality food and better service. I had the takoyaki and the deluxe dinner for two and had a bulgogi dinner to go. The food was great but it is quite expensive."}
{"text":"Whenever I was craving for Korean soup back when I still live in Sauga, I thought of Miga! Even up till now, I still haven't found the same quality of rich, yummy, Braised Short Rib soup with rice anywhere!! I totally missed it so much that I might even plan a trip flying back to Canada (someday).

The Kalbi are great too, although I didn't have the chance to try it (as I ordered the braised short rib all the time).

I recommend this place if you're looking for quality. Don't go here if you're in a hurry though, it tends to take awhile for the food to come."}
{"text":"Superb food and service. Korean BBQ is excellent. They have several private Dining rooms for groups."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere, but a little on the pricey side! Would definitely recommend the Korean barbecue over anything else!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been here.

Although I loved this place, I don't come here too often because it is pricier than other (more casual) restaurants - which Mississauga now has many! But with quality and classy atmosphere, you really can't beat Miga.

Came here for dinner tonight and was blown away by their food quality, atmosphere, and friendly service (although they were so busy that we did have to ask twice for somethings - they still served with great courtesy and respect).

There were three of us today, and we ordered to share:
- Galbi Tang
- Premium BBQ for 2, which includes: 
   ~ soybean stew
   ~ salad or lettuce
   ~ 2 rice
   ~ Saeng Galbi (AAA short ribs with light seasoning)
   ~ Ju Mul Luk (beef short rib with light seasoning)
   ~ Samgyeopsal (sliced pork belly)

Everything was really good! We were especially surprised by the Galbi Tang, which had such a delicious broth!

They were also generous with their banchans this time: with 6 different sides and constant refills.

Also, while looking at the menu, we noticed their promos for lunch: which does offer AYCE. And they have take-out only specials: combos for only $10 including tax, and rolls up to 30% off!"}
{"text":"I go to this place with my husband so many times I just realized I never reviewed it. Our friends introduced us to this place and we have been going here for the last 4 years. On average, probably once a month. Would come more often but I'm afraid then I won't need to turn around to see my bum. 

Food: Delicious!!! We have brought friends and family here and they all love it. So flavorful. It's authentic good Korean BBQ. We love the family set. My husband loves eating the meat with salad and their tofu paste. I love their spicy beef noodle. The maki rolls are delicious as well. I like their tofu soup too. Our favorite is the premium bbq set. They have tapas now which is a nice update.

Atmosphere: lovely. lively but private as the tables are just far enough. The washroom is always clean unlike some asian places. Once we took my parents and siblings here and they gave us a private room in the back, really private and nice. For big groups, should book one of those rooms. 

Service: Friendly. Prompt. Lovely staff. The owner or manager, small pretty asian lady always come to greet us and say hi when we drop by. Very friendly. They change the grill often. Always prompt with the food and overall just friendly. 

Price: compared to ayce chinese run korean bbq it is more expensive but then again you get what you pay for. This place, the meat quality is really f'in fantastic. It is pretty cheap actually. 60 for the combo. Comes with refills of appetizers. Soup. Salad. Lots of meat. I am always too full so never claim the free ice cream with checkins. 

Highly recommend! Four years we have been going here and the quality has always been the same - excellent. Actually we are leaving now to go there - gobble gobble gobble."}
