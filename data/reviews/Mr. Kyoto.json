{"text":"Very bad experience. Super slow, and the waiter forgot to bring the plate for wasabi when our sushi roll are served. My friend ordered stir-fried udon, but after almost 1hr, the meal is still not done yet. When we brought this up, they didn't even try to make up for this, and not a single apology was given. No tip for this kind of service of course. Why I cannot give 0 or negative star?"}
{"text":"I ordered online via eatstreet and they didn't have the order ready (probably eatstreets fault). I told them my ramen order and what I received wasn't what I thought it would be. The ramen had chicken when the description had pork. They also forgot the extra egg I ordered. Maybe it was an off day or something but I'm pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been in this is the second time they've got my order wrong. The first time I waited quite a while while they redid it this time I just took it as is. Both times I asked for no peas. This time I took a picture of both the order I received and the receipt. Maybe I should have said no broccoli. The first time the broccoli was two pieces of miniscule broccoli. This time it was two large pieces of broccoli I wish there would have been as much broccoli as there were peas"}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this place because I got a restaurant.com certificate. The experience overall was okay. Sashimi was okay, but my Unagi don was not as expected (too mushy). I tried not to be picky about the service because I used to work in a restaurant, but my server was not attentive at all. We weren't asked even once if everything is good. The worst part is they refused my certificate claiming that they don't do business with restaurant.com and their information are being used...That was it. No more further explanation. I am very sure people came there to redeem the certificate before. If that site is a scam (for real), why don't they make sure it won't happen again to others because this will also leave bad reputation to their business. My date was ruined, I left feeling extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This restaurant replaces Spicy Tang which used to occupy the same space. Different name, different cuisine, same fake shill reviews on Yelp. Look at all the 5-star reviews, they're all generic statements consisting of 2-3 sentences that say nothing informative or specific about the restaurant. Also notice that all of the 5-star reviews are written by new users with very few total reviews. I dislike shilling, but I dislike laziness even more. Shame on the owners for not at least putting some effort into artificially propping up their business."}
{"text":"Great idea and great variety. I love the tuna and the salmon both are really good."}
{"text":"With the new owner, Mr. Kyoto has some amazing food. I've gotten the Kyoto Bowl with Ponzu Sauce and Spicy Mayo and it tastes amazing. Lots of fresh veggies so the quantity is good enough for more than 1 meal. All in all, one of the best places to eat at on Green St. for about $7.5 total."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Very friendly staff (helpful, good service, polite), and the food is great. I recommend getting a bowl, but ask for hell sauce (not on the menu but very flavorful and spicy). Often has promotions on hooked, so keep an eye out."}
{"text":"Got an eel don. The sauce was this weird sickeningly sweet soy sauce/sesame oil blend. The vegetables were freezer peas and corn. Overall probably never coming back again."}
{"text":"Very bad service/no service. Went there alone to get udon noodle, my server took my order and literally didn't serve. Someone else brought the noodle, and my server never stop by until the check. Wow.

The noodle soup is pretty much hot water + dashi + Shoyu; the noodle is the noodle you can buy at Asian market, not Nama Udon ????,  in short, just don't go to this place, you might lose your love in JP food."}
{"text":"Their service was horrendously slow and the food just wasn't good in comparison to other Japanese restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went to the original kyoto, and wasn't too impressed with their menu or the quality of their food. BUT, today I went to mr.kyoto, a little skeptical, but it may be one of my favorite restaurants here on campus! I got kyoto noodles and also a chicken bowl. The quality of their ingredients are amazing, and it's so nice that the menu is super simple. For the noodles, the carrot-lime sauce was absolutely amazing. The noodles could use a little bit of work, but when it's mixed with everything, it was so good. The bowl was just as good, if not better. You can't really go wrong with any combination, and that's also what makes it amazing! I just found out they do weekly sauces, so I will definitely be back to try them all! Definitely would and will be recommending to everyone i know!"}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty poke! The raw salmon was fresh and the service is very friendly. Definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"Just tried this for my first time today while visiting my girlfriend, we both really enjoyed the food and environment here. We have already made plans to come back and try other dishes they serve! We both got their bowls, one with beef and one with spicy crab meat and we simply devoured them. Cannot wait to come back and try more delicious food, thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times since they've opened. The first two times I came here was closer to when they first opened, and I was impressed. I got the salmon kyoto bowl both times and the bowls had a decent amount of fish, and everything was really flavorful. 

The third time I came here, I learned that they had a $5 deal on the hooked app that could be used for any bowl except fish. So, I ordered a beef bowl to-go with spicy mayo and ponzu on the side. The portion was really big, and the meat to rice ratio was 1:1. 

The last two times I've been here have been disappointing. I used the hooked app for a deal, but now the deal is $6 (instead of $5), and the portion has gotten much smaller. I've noticed recently that the food comes out cold because all the veggies they put on top are cold, while the rice and protein are warm, which results in cold food. They've also downsized a bit on the portion, so now the bowl is mostly rice and veggies and very little protein. For the extra $1 and smaller portion, you are much better off eating at other places on Green for the same price, since you'll probably get more food and your food will be served hot. I don't think I'll come back here again even with the Hooked deals.

Side note: You can no longer order sauces on the side."}
{"text":"Never been to the old Kyoto but apparently the new owner changed the concept and the restaurant is revamped now so if you had a bad experience with them I would recommend giving them another try now. Everyone that works there is nice. 
I like the tofu bowls which are already affordable at $6.50 but they also always have deals on hooked app. The bowls consist of rice, fresh veggies and a protein/sauce option making it an overall healthy but good tasting casual lunch or dinner spot . The speaker is really loud so if you sit by it, the volume is awkwardly loud and u have to yell to talk to ur friends lol. 
Also my friend and I tried the takoyaki and a few of the balls were fairly undercooked on the inside."}
{"text":"Went there because I had purchased a certificate on Restaurant.com. Upon entering, there is a handwritten sign stating that they are NOT a Restaurant.com contractor, implying that certificates will not be accepted. The waitress said that Restaurant.com included Kyoto in their  site without their permission, which I highly doubt. (Their certificates are STILL on the Restaurant.com site.) Though it did not look busy, I was told there was a 20-40 min wait and they would call me when a table opened up. A table did open up in about 20 min, and I met my friend there. We both ordered the 11 pc sushi special for $22.50, which was not bad, though the white tuna was pretty rubbery. The salmon was good though. To their credit, this is one of the few places where the actual sushi rice (yes, sushi refers to the rice, not the raw fish) was prepared like it should be, namely slightly still warm and seasoned with rice vinegar and sugar. The miso soup was obviously instant, and it was just warm, so we asked that it be heated up. It came back moderately warmer, I assume they reheated it in the microwave. They apparently do not have a liquor license since there is no alcohol on their menu, and the available drinks are mainly bottled drinks that you would find in a vending machine. The servers appeared inexperienced, not surprising for a college town and this being a new establishment.  The food was good, though a bit pricey, and the execution still needs work."}
{"text":"Really fresh ingredients and Richard behind the counter is a super nice guy and takes great care of his customers. I recommend getting the double fish option. Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality ingredients- so it just goes to show that you don't have to sacrifice quality for price. Overall a great value."}
{"text":"Really disappointed of the current quality. Last time I paid for a amount of rice and a taste of tuna. Too bad, I expected more from this place."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to go check this place out for their soft opening last week. The wait for 6 people was around 30 minutes, which is to be expected since at the time they didn't have their yelp up yet and we didn't know how to put in a reservation.

I'm definitely going to go back and try their ramen at some point but for the time being, I'm looking forward to what this new Sushi/Izakaya/Ramen place can do for the Green Street food scene. So I'm optimistic in my rating (I'd say I'm hovering at a 3.5 stars but since you can't do halves, they get a 4 for now.)

Atmosphere:
The inside looks basically exactly like Spicy Tang did but with a few additions (namely some cute Japanese banners near the sushi bar area.) It's pretty, clean, comfy, and a bit more trendy then some of the other places on Green St.
-Kinda small
-Trendy decor (it's mostly red on the inside)
-Cute little Japanese decorations
-Booths and tables are kinda small/cramped

Food:
-Miso soup is pretty watery
-Presentation is a bit sloppy
-The eel roll I had was pretty good
-Prices are pretty consistent with Green St food prices and what you get is very similar to what you get at Sushi Rock
-They don't have ramen yet, and that's what I'm most looking forward to since Koto Ramen closed
-The bento boxes had pretty good portions

Service:
Considering that this was their soft opening, I'm pretty impressed. There were a few hiccups in the service. The hostess was a big overwhelmed and the servers would both take orders from a table.
-Disorganized, but pretty good for a soft opening
-Service was prompt and the staff was pretty friendly

Tl;dr: This place definitely has promise and I'm looking forward to what they're like when soft opening ends and they get into the swing of things! :) I may have overrated them but I took into consideration that they were so new. I'll update my review after I try it again!"}
{"text":"When I hear \"japanese rice bowl\" I am thinking about stuff like Donkatsu, Unadon or Gyudon instead of some Chipotle style bowl with an asian touch. I have to admit that I am not japanese and I cannot call this cultural misappropriation for them but I seriously doubt if this kind of bowls is actually from(or found) the great city of Kyoto(enlighten me if you are japanese). I am very disappointed that they stopped serving sushi and other good japanese stuff but I guess that is what it takes for a business to stay alive in the center of campus town. What I could not understand is their definition of \"mild\" because I had to use all the napkins they gave me (and they were pretty generous on that) when I ate my noodles. At least the place was clean, the staff was friendly and their octopus balls wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Got the Ramen and it was delicious. However I picked the 2 level of spicy out of 5 and it was unbearable and I like spicy things. Will definitely get the 1 level of spicy next time."}
{"text":"Rolls way overpriced, ginger tastes like wet towels, salmon tastes like it's been in the freezer for weeks. In fact, it was a little frozen. I ended up paying $17 for this sad, sad meal that consisted of a tiny portion of stinky frozen fish and rice. HOW are you going to charge these prices for McDonald's fish fillet reject quality?

Update:
As the owner stated below, the lunch prices are much more reasonable. That said, the sushi was really, really bad considering what I paid that night. Like, the taste. Old. Stinky. Not just the fact that it was kind of frozen.

I'd expect that from a $9 roll, not a $17 one.

Also, it's only slander/libel if it isn't true."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend. Ordered a bunch of items to share. Food was alright but the service was weird. It was silent service. Sever took our order and brought the food to the table, all while never saying anything. Just a small bow. No follow up. He did bring us refills on our drinks but again, didn't say anything. One thing that bothered me was our server had hickeys all over his neck. That is so incredibly tacky and disgusting. My boss would never allow one of our employees to work with customers looking like that. Yuck. I may or may not come back again. It was a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"This is like an Asian-fusion chipotle. The ingredients are super fresh and you can tell it's great quality! Also, the service is wonderful. The owner checks in to make sure his customers are satisfied. 

I'm seriously surprised the reviews aren't better because I think this is an awesome place!!!"}
{"text":"The poke here is okay at best. There were not many additional toppings to choose from, and the quality does not seem fresh. I ordered the junior salmon poke bowl with corn, salad mix, and ponzu sauce. I give this place 3-stars mainly because of the portion size for the price. At $6 for the small size, it was actually enough for my lunch. However, the salmon had a gummy texture and the lettuce from the salad mix was almost completely withered. I'd rather spend an extra $2-$3 and go somewhere else with better quality, even if it was the same portion size."}
{"text":"Its a nice place to go grab a poke bowl that has a good selection of toppings and sauces. You can choose up to three proteins and the fish is of pretty good quality! It can be kinda pricey but when you can get such great quality fish it can be quite worth it! I plan to come here more often and hope that it continues to be great!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fresh sushis. The price is competitive than other sushi places. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Super awesome, environmentally conscious boss. Great food. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I think the food here is a little bit pricey for the fast Japanese food, overall it's okay, not bad after all. The food is pretty fast. 
If you get a rice bowl and takoyaki expect to pay 19-20$"}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5 but you can't give half stars. I've only been once and had a pretty good experience. The lunch special is a good deal - you get 2 sushi rolls for under $10. It's not amazing sushi, but pretty decent. The space is cramped and dark though, and the service could have been better. I thought it was pretty rude that they brought the check before I had asked for it or was even done eating. And it wasn't at a packed time either. All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"The octopus baked ball is great but not so much of the salmon bowl! Not the typical poke bowl you would experience in LA :( very little salmon with lots of wired stuff in it :("}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by how this place has turned around. I had tried this place when it first opened and was not a fan, but through the improvements that the owner has made, I have noticed a significant upgrade in quality. The ambiance is nice with good music and high quality customer service. The owner walks around and asked us about our experience at the restaurant while also making good recommendations on the food. The chicken bowl that I got was great, very filling and tasty. Would recommend a sauce combo of spicy mayo and bbq. 

Also check out the offer on the receipt for a free bowl along with a charity donation on behalf of Mr.Kyoto."}
{"text":"I picked Mr. Tokyo for two proteins, probably each of which will be more than if I choose three proteins? There are also eel don and beef don, ramen, many sidekicks to choose. The menu doesn't include many items but have my favorite fish! They are raw and fresh! Definitely come again"}
{"text":"I got a salmon poke bowl and the hell ramen. the hell ramen was too hot, so if you can't handle spicy, i'd recommend you go with the level 0 - no spicy. The poke bowl was pretty good. i enjoyed it! come back! The portion size is a little smaller for $10 but food was good."}
{"text":"UPDATE: So this place has a new owner and different concept, so I've updated my rating from a 1 to 3 star. It has potential and it's better than before but they still need to work a few things out. Luckily, it seems the new management is pretty adaptable and doing all they can to leave behind the bad rep of Kyoto. The owner is usually there trying to make sure everything is going smoothly and customers are happy. Regarding the food, the bowl has a lot of fresh veggies and offers something really different. That's great, however, the flavor is lacking and the fish can be pretty bad. I got the Mr. Kyoto bowl with spicy crab, salmon and tuna. The salmon and spicy crab were good but I barely had any salmon--that's probably just by chance. However, the tuna was freezer burnt, fishy and inedible. I'll upload a picture too. They need to be consistently good when serving raw fish. It's a health hazard. Which brings me to the lack of wasabi on the menu. I hope they introduce a wasabi based sauce to the menu. It's something you absolutely need with raw fish to counter the germs. Overall I think they have potential, they're a step above the previous concept/ownership but they have a long way to go.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Rainbow roll for $12 with barely any fish and that too with the salmon getting brown. I really liked this place at first but their quality seems to be dropping and they're cutting corners, skimping on portions and just overall providing subpar food for a price that it's not worth. I'm willing to pay more than I usually would on lunch for sushi--the ingredients are more expensive-- but given the minuscule amount of fish here and the fact that it seemed old means this meal wasn't worth half the price I paid. I've regrettably had better sushi from a grocery store."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The ramen is good, but the most awesome thing they have here is the kyoto bowl. The tofu is soft and delicious, and the ponzu sauce is delicious. It's also pretty healthy and low In calories and the vegetables are always really fresh. The best part is the ponzu sauce, which is super awesome. I have a super sensitive stomach so the greasy food in my dorm makes me sick a lot, so i like to eat here because there is practically NO grease or oil in anything (except maybe the mayo). (I've only ever had the vegetation Kyoto bowls though...). The new owner is already really friendly and cool. 
P.S. don't be fooled by the username, i am a real person. I just don't like having my name on the internet."}
{"text":"I think this place has changed it's name to Mr. Kyoto or Kyoto Express. Not sure. Their menu has changed from sit down to takeout Japanese. They're now using heavy plasticware instead of plates for dine in, which is a depressing waste since nothing appears to be getting recycled. 

They've reduced their sushi offerings and quality. The $4 California roll was 50% cucumber and warm. Quality has also declined on tempura entrees.

They have added poke bowls to the menu, which I was excited to try. I enjoyed the Mr. Kyoto (mixed salmon and tuna) bowl, but the avocado was unforgivably unripe and the salad included was sad iceberg lettuce. Adding GOOD poke bowls to their menu could be a great move, but as of right now, it's meh."}
{"text":"Food is great. Got the pokki salad and the sushi platter. Very good sushi. However the service is not good. Server isn't rude but they hardly check up on you, and don't move empty plates out of the way and are generally confused about your order (mostly seems like language barrier?)"}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Ordered from here three times, and while the second time the food was a little mediocre (I'll credit it to the fact that I ordered around closing time, and the rice and meat they used must have been what was left from the line), every other order was actually really delicious. New management has been trying to remake the Mr. Kyoto name from the last management (horrible reviews on yelp, never visited though), and the new owner is a very friendly guy who seems very adaptable and caring about his establishment. Definitely an attitude that will help a restaurant take off. Hoping to see this place get more popular in the future!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with good prices. I always get the chicken bowl. The ingredients seem very fresh, and the portions are generous. They provide eco-friendly decomposable spoons, forks and bowls with every order. They have bad reviews because they reused the yelp page created by the previous owners, but this place is lit. I always go there to get my lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I both agreed that the food here is something else and that we had to spread the word. There are a lot of options here though I always get the noodles, Kyoto sauce, and spicy mayo. All of the ingredients seem fresh. If you can somehow eat scorpion peppers, their level 6 ramen is amazing."}
{"text":"So happy about this addition to Green street! We have a lot of Asian choices around campus, but this is the first to offer affordable, fresh poké. For less than $10, you can easily get 2 meals out of a bowl! The ingredients are also super fresh--the vegetables are crispy and the salmon and tuna melt in your mouth. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good poke bowl for central illinois. They don't have as many add ons for the poke bowl plus they lack the classic masago, tempura crunch, and seaweed toppings you'd normally find but for the price it's pretty good. The fish is also nice and fresh. I haven't gotten any fish that tasted like it had freezer burns. Definitely get their bowls when they have hooked deals so you can save some money.

They staff was pretty friendly and the place was clean upon entering. I do just wish they had more of the classic poke add-ons and wasabi mayo sauce."}
{"text":"The food was fine but as someone else pointed out no better than sakanaya. What makes this place a bad experience is the horrible service. I watched the person who gave us the check stare at her phone for fifteen minutes while we were right next to her before she decided to pick up my card. That's pretty disrespectful. If you're serving me in a restaurant, you better not be looking at your phone while I'm supposed to be served."}
{"text":"This place is what's keeping me alive this semester. And by that I order about 6 bowls a week from here. 

I most commonly order chicken as my meat because it's the cheapest. But the crabmeat, beef, salmon and tuna are all great in my opinion. I always get all the veggies. You can order up to 3 sauces so I almost always put the kyoto ponzu and Japanese mayo on everything.

To change things up I usually throw in bbq, carrot lime or their sauce of the week.

Friendly staff and the food is prepared quickly too."}
{"text":"No frills, create your own Japanese place with fresh, very good food.   We stopped in for a quick dinner and enjoyed the rice bowl with veggies, tofu and a really tasty spicy sauce.  The ramen was served warm with chicken and veggies. The broth was savory with just the right texture noodles.  The atmosphere is modern and clean.  I wish the menu had more pics because I wasn't sure what the Roll version might be as far as size and build.  Offering more drinks than a soda fountain would be nice too."}
{"text":"I go here a lot due to their Hooked promotions.  All of their bowls are really good im an especially big fan of the Tuna.  All of their fish is sushi quality and served raw.  Japanese and Spicy Mayo are my favorite sauces.  Be careful with their ramen the spicy levels are not to be taken lightly.  Kyoto is like a Japanese chipotle, I love it!  The Octopus balls are almost a dessert, worth trying at least once!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood udon was delicious! Loved the rolls during lunch special as well. Definitely a must try in the champaign-urbana area."}
{"text":"Mr. Kyoto is a nice Asian-fusion place with good salad/rice bowls with chicken, beef, and/or fish. If you have the Hooked app, they usually publish deals such as free appetizers or buy one bowl get one free. The restaurant also serves ramen, although I've only had it once when they were open really late. Overall, it's pretty good, especially if you can catch one of the Hooked deals."}
{"text":"Really traditional and yammy?My favorite Japanese restaurant! Definitely recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Food was great, good portion size , price was exceptionally good. The only thing I had a problem with is the very loud music with wording very inappropriate for a public restaurant. Though it is on a college campus I was here on business and was rather offended. Felt like I was in a club and not a restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd say that I was super dissapointed with the old Mr. Kyoto. But since the new owner bought it, it had been reforming in a very great substantial way. Now Mr. Kyoto is my favorite lunch spot along with ita Hooked app deals. I can taste that their ingredients are fresh and so far delicious tasting. I don't regret the reason why I tried the new Mr. Kyoto."}
{"text":"We ordered the takoyaki, chicken teriyaki, and sushi deluxe. Proportions were perfect for two people, but the sushi and chicken were overpriced for their quality."}
{"text":"This is place is wonderful with excellent service and authentic Japanese food. I would definitely come again with my friends."}
{"text":"Why did they change the menu? Seriously you call this ramen? Ordered spicy level 1-mild, still so spicy! Used to be a japenese food restaurant, if you have already change the food to Kyoto bowl, then maybe the restaurant should just change its name to Mr. Champaign."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted on this place, because the food is good but the service is a bit lacking, especially for the price. I'd probably actually give it 3.5 stars, but I rounded up since they're kind of new and the food was fresh. 

Be warned that for the price, the Don bowls are not really worth it. Their sushi rolls and their lunch bento are great though, and I would go back for those. The servers took a while to get to us, but everything tasted fresh, and I was given good recommendations. The unagi is quite good even though it is pricey. They were not yet serving ramen when I was there, but I would go back to try it. They also only serve bento during lunch, so be warned about that."}
{"text":"This restaurant was honestly one of the best I've tried on Green street. It was fresh and packed with amazing flavor. This place should have higher reviews because the original kyoto was bought by a new owner and this new menu is something people should try. I would compare this to chipotle, but with an Asian flair. I loved how flavorful my rice bowl was. I would definitely come here again for the good food and music."}
{"text":"The servers here are fantastic, friendly faces that greet you when you enter, and they even remember you if you come back! They often have Hooked deals which is usually the best time to get them. The bowls themselves are generous with the servings and tastes really fresh, definitely a good asian-chipotle style fusion that you can't find elsewhere on campus. I've tried the Takoyaki twice now and wish that there were more octopus in them (or less batter), but still good. Definitely a place to try on campus!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place with healthy food and convenient location in Champaign. The meals are big for the price and quality is high. Lots of veggies and good protein. The people working there are nice and friendly. The owner himself spends most of his time in restaurant welcoming customers, making sure everything goes well. Highly recommended place!"}
{"text":"Ramen is flavorful and has a very generous amount of noodles, but the friendly staff is what really makes this place great. I'll be back to try the bowl next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place- been here more than 10times with Hooked deal. Customer service is amazing as always. One thing that bothers me is the music playing in the store; could turn down a little so my friends and I can talk lol."}
{"text":"They have BOGO from 2-4pm on hooked everyday so it's definitely worth it to go at those times to get your money's worth. I get the Mr. Kyoto Salad which allows you to pick 3 different proteins (I get tuna, salmon, and spicy crab). The portion is fair but the fish is a bit too fishy for me despite my love for raw fish. Overall, it's a good place to eat but the wait time may be a bit slow for those who are in a hurry. It took me about 15 minutes to get my food to go while there were about 3 customers in the restaurant. Will love to go back and try their ramen and takoyaki!"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi at reasonable prices! Good portions too. Think it's our new favorite place for sushi. I know it's new, but it's small and I can imagine a long wait for a table once word gets out."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced food. The rice was purple which was awesome! Surprisingly good seafood for being the Midwest. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably wont come again. Fish was half frozen, wet and very probably not that fresh. We were sick after eating the fish. No idea why the early reviewers liked this place. Do not try the tempura because they have no idea of what tempura is: they just give you heavy bread-coated shrimps with a pathetic portion of sauce on the side. The oil also made me feel sick. 

Serving size was good for the price. Probably it is a good idea to have bentos for lunch here. 

People were generally nice but the service was messy. The place is actually quite small but they are over stuffed. Some waiters/waitresses got nothing to do but just chatting. The guy served us told us that one of our dishes was served with rice while later another guy said no, there was not."}
{"text":"Edit: They fixed alot of what I complained of below. Good changes, give them a shot!


Original review:
I stopped in for the beef poke bowl and wasn't impressed by a couple of things. Unsticky Basmati rice in East Asian is ok, but I would use sticky rice, even sushi rice would be better. The mass of iceberg lettuce should be dressed with a simple sauce. Mixed greens would be better. The beef was awesome, but there needs to be a larger portion for $10."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Quick and great service. I suggest the house BBQ on your meal. Also Danielle helped me out today and she was the best. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"This was a great experience, we drove 45 minutes to try it and it was definitely worth it. The staff is friendly and the owner was engaging and gave us two drinks on him for driving all that way to come here. Tried the Hell Ramen was delicious with the octopus rolls that were very unique. My girlfriend got the create your own and was so good we shared half of everything. Would definitely recommend going here, food is great and staff was awesome."}
{"text":"This is an update of my first review.  I went back in a third time and placed my order and when the owner/manager(?) heard me state that I did NOT WANT PEAS, he asked if I had posted a review on Yelp.  when I said I did he comped my order.  It was perfect!   It is a good amount of food and a good value.  Also, as someone with Celiac who needs to eat gluten free, there are many safe choices. I really like spicy and when I asked for the hottest sauce they had the cashier suggested ordering it on the side.  Good call, their hot sauce is HOT! I also really like that their containers and utensils are compostable.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice presentation, looks promising, but does not taste good.

I ordered take out from here because I was craving sashimi but Sakanaya wasnt an option at the time (should have just waited for dinner)... it was not good!!! As I looked closer at the pieces of fish they looked less appealing. And it's nothing compared to Sakanayas fresh tasting sashimi. The ginger is also gross looking and I threw it out. Paid 20$ for garbage. I might try this place again but probably not."}
{"text":"Delicious fusion with ingredients more fresh than most local restaurants. Offers food in forms of bowls, rolls, and salads which gives a poke/sushi fusion."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Champaign! I'm so impressed by the welcoming service and tasty food there. The atmosphere was quiet cozy and the price is sooooo cheap. Even with this low prize the quality and quantity of the food was still amazing. Defiantly gonna go back there soon."}
