{"text":"So fresh! I've never felt so comfortable eating a slice of raw fish anywhere.  Everything was presented beautifully, and everything was so delicious. I would not hesitate to return, and i plan to do so as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Just visited Montreal this week. This restaurant is REALLY good! The quality and freshness was amazing. Everything that we ordered looked delicious! I like the bring your own wine as well.. Makes for a great night. The salmon tar tar was great and I enjoyed the Victoria roll very much"}
{"text":"I was won over by the non-sushi options. ie the real Japanese food.

The seafood was fresh and expertly marinated and cooked. The grilled calamari were heavenly!  

The sushi was great too, as was the price point and service! Plus it's a BYOB, gotta love that..."}
{"text":"Located in the Mile-End, this bring-your-own-wine intimate sushi restaurant is simply my favorite sushi place in Montreal! 

First, the staff. They are all SO nice, i've basically come to know them a bit (seeing as I'm a regular). Service is always with a smile, they are super attentive to their clients' needs. 

Second, the SUSHI. Always fresh, i've never been disappointed with their quality - really consistent! What's fun about this restaurant is that it also offers delicious dishes (the steak is great - i'm telling you!). So you can also bring along people that are \"not that into sushi\".  They have steak. No excuses.

Third, the bring your own wine. Hello?!  How rare to find a BYOW sushi place in MTL. I can count them on one hand. So yeah, that's pretty cool. Enough said! 

Lastly, the price. Very decent, you get so much more than what you pay for.

Go!"}
{"text":"My all time favourite sushi place.... BYOW gives it an A+!!! 
The sushi is awesome, you can even order for pick up. The ambiance is cute and intimate, to bring a date or even friends (there's a back room for group of 20) and the staff is super nice! I've been there over ten times and never ever had an issue."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in town! They never disappoint after all these years! Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/11/09/yuukai-the-all-time-favourite-for-sushi/"}
{"text":"I tried this place with a friend after hearing/reading rave reviews and fiercely missing good sushi after a trip to Japan. Maybe I'm spoiled now but I found the majority of the sushi we ate to be quite good (not mind blowing) with the standouts being the amazing unagi (eel) and excellent beef tartare. Freshness was bang-on (though I admit, I've had even fresher at some local all-you-can-eats). Stunning plating and attentive staff. 

I think the only major reason for the three stars is that I felt it was a bit overpriced. I'd rather pay a bit less on food and not bring my own wine."}
{"text":"Came here once with a girlfriend. Liked that the place is BYOW and we most definitely had a good time.

The service was a bit slow despite showing up for early dinner, the food is fresh with the right amount of sophistication (not overly complicated as some sushis can turn out to be nowadays but not plainly boring either). Portion size are decent bordering the smaller end. Price wise is a little high in my opinion. For two we ended up with a +60$ bill despite the BYOW factor and walking away with a mediumly full stomach.

Would revisit if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good sushi!  Whats even better is that they let you bring your own wine.
Its pretty busy so its best to call ahead (especially on the weekend)
Prices are descent and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Surprised by both the taste and the bill. Hmm, can't say the bill is stopping me from going back. YOU WIN THIS ONE YUUKAI.

Edit: Make sure to get anything with Eel, the beef sashimi, & bring some wine why don't you."}
{"text":"Such a cute place hiding in the middle of mile end. Cabbed to Yuukai on a chilly friday night, and it was worth every penny. 

  Great sashimi, sushi and maki selection. Everything from the presentation to the taste was done perfectly. The presentation may not be as creative as saint sushi but the quality of the fish is no less. The atmosphere was very class and cozy. It was also nice that there is alot of space in the restaurant so you dont have to expect to touch elbows with the stranger next to you. Perfect for a quiet date night in my opinion. 

 The service could've been a little bit faster but it could be because we were starving.
Price is pretty reasonable for a la carte sushi, around 40-60 for two. It's also BYOB so don't forget to drop by the SAQ before you head to the restaurant !"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi for a very decent price. Just reopen 3 months ago after a devastating fire. DIshes are beautiful and very tasty. You can find more delicate sushis, but rarely better at this price. BYOB is a great bonus. Cool ambiance and good service."}
{"text":"It was OK. Certainly not the best sushi I've had. I found the portions to be tiny! We left starving. And we are not gluttons! It was pricey for what you got. Service was very good though. I might give these guys another chance if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Yuukai twice and both times found the food to be a hit or miss and the bill to be somewhat painful for what you get.

Last year, I clearly remember having some amazing tuna tataki here that was probably the best I've ever had at any restaurant. The veggie tempura was ok with nothing to write home about and the gyozas were just meh. Having kept this in mind when I returned here last week, I made sure to only order a few sushi rolls and try something new off the appetizer list. 

The rib appetizer was absolutely delicious, but my sushi rolls were just meh. For over $40, you'd expect to get really great food but unfortunately Yuukai did not deliver once again.

I likely won't be back but wouldn't deter anyone from going. Service is good, and food is ok. The big plus is that it's a BYOW so that may be a deciding factor for you!"}
{"text":"Yuukai is a small, fancy lookin joint with OK lookin waitresses.

The sushi is fine. It's neither the best nor the worst in the city.

The non sushi items are very expensive. How they get away with charging 18$ for what amounts to a completely average plate of udon remains a mystery to me.

In terms of starters, 7$ wakame salad is at thing at this establishment. I wish I was kidding, I'm not. It's like buying something  pre-made for a buck and then charging you seven for putting it in a bowl. Actually that's exactly what it is.

The meal was acceptable. We ordered sushi and a vegetarian udon dish.

The place is very noisy. Had trouble hearing one another in conversation, not one of their strong points. Sound insulation is an issue.

I would recommend one of the all you can eat joins that are somehow less noisy and offer a much more vast menu and, in the case of crescent sushi, better quality, fresher fish.

I wasn't particularly impressed. If you truly enjoy sushi and you don't like noisy places, avoid it.

Otherwise, it's passable."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Montreal: service is outstanding, in an easy going atmosphere. Bring your own wine! What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We saw a mouse on the floor below the front window of the restaurant.

Yelp defines 1 star as \"Eek! Methinks not.\" I would have to say that's an understatement for this review. A couple of days later the experience still grosses me out a bit, so I'm just going to make this easy for me to write and put the review in bullet form.


-We were the last group in the restaurant shortly after closing and had just finished our meal (which was pretty decent honestly).

-My friends sitting in front of me and facing the front window saw the mouse.

-We freaked out a bit and let the waitress know. She seemed somewhat apologetic and said they would take care of it and went over to talk to the manager

-She came back to us with the check and no other comment about the mouse.

-I was too freaked out about seeing a mouse right after eating to think too much about what an appropriate reaction from the restaurant would be.

-The waitress came back with our check like normal.

-This pissed me off a bit. I understand that things happen. I don't live in a dream world and realize there's probably some pretty gross things I've eaten without realizing it.

-I let her know that it was pretty crazy to come back with a check and have us pay the full tab like normal like nothing happened after telling her we saw a mouse a few minutes ago.

-She went back to talk to her manager. The manager came back and said something to the effect of, \"This is what we can do...\" and handed us a check that I think was ~$130 of a $150 tab.

-This pissed me off more because instead of an apologetic, it's unacceptable to see a mouse in our restaurant attitude, she acted like she was doing us a favor giving us a bit of a discount.

-I don't have a good answer for what I wanted or expected them to do to make it right but that was not it.

-The next 5-10mins consisted of us seeing the mouse run by quickly for a split second, but the manager not seeing it, which just made it come off like we had made the thing up, and me arguing with her about how I thought it was bogus we were having to have a conversation about whether we should get a discounted meal or free or what we thought should happen.

-Ultimately she said she wouldn't feel comfortable with us paying and we left, but the point really wasn't to get a discounted or free meal (though no, I didn't want to or thing we should pay for it). We really just wanted them to recognize and feel a bit of what we were feeling about how gross it was and react accordingly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service were both really nice. For the price, the sushis were well executed as well as the appetizers ( we had the soft shell crab and the tofu). Not the best sushis in montreal, but a good option a casual night out."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in Montreal for the price and it might because not many people now about it. It actually has authentic Japanese texture, which means it's not like all the other places in this price range where they offer Wonton soup, Vietnamese Spring Rolls and anything else that Montrealers think is \"asian\" food. I had the Sushi plate which included 15 pieces of assorted Sashimi, Sushi and maki rolls. $15 + tip and you can bring your own, wine, beer, saki, whatever you have in your fridge."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of my preferred in Town.
Their seafood miso soup is to die for. They also have few specialities that are amazing and if you like sushi as desert, you gotta try their desert sushi. Service is great and very attentive, if you not sure what to order they will definitely help you. Have been there several time Stephane (one of their waitress) is great, always in a happy mood and will probably remember what you like to eat and if they have new specialities he may mention if you will or will not like it
Also they may ask what you like as sushi and suggest you some ideas. 
Always fresh, never pre-prepared food
I definitely suggest you to try this cute spot in town if you love sushi's specialities"}
{"text":"Came to Yuukai on a trip to Montreal and I can definitely say I'll be returning back whenever I go to Montreal. 

This restaurant is more on the pricier side but is also very fancy. 

All the dishes we ordered came out at a reasonable time, although we had to wait for our assorted sushi which actually took awhile but thankfully didn't notice that much because we had so many other dishes coming. 

I hands down recommend getting the black cod, it comes on a bed of noodles and it just melts in your mouth. I also recommend getting the salmon flambé, soooo yummy. I'd get multiple orders of it because of how good it is. 

Overall, would recommend this if you're trying to go out to a fancier dinner for a date. The bill can get quite high (mine was $400) but really is worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best bring your own wine sushi restaurant in Montreal.  I have been going here for years and i always enjoy my time here. The staff and service is friendly and professional, the sushi is fresh, the food is tasty all for a very reasonable price. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends."}
{"text":"Food was good very  small portion though but the ambience isn't really interesting! It was a reasonable experience but I don't go again"}
{"text":"Only the ones on the black board were good to try. Miso soup is better taste than other sushi restaurant. The price is a bit high for the service they provide. PLEASE replace the cheap chopsticks if possible."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant is so popular. Food is overpriced and the quality is meh. The fish soup was pretty good but the sashimi we ordered was really not impressive at all. The fish was just OK. And the 8 dollar sea urchin was bitter - it was overpriced for 2 tiny pieces and it was bad. We had to complain to the waiter about the bad sea urchin and he canceled that from the check for us. We were still very hungry after the expensive and just OK sushi dinner so went to McDonald's in the end. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"BRING YOUR OWN WINE! Went to yuukai for a small 3 person birthday dinner. Turned out great.

Food : very good! The sushi tasted great, the rolls were properly done. I always order sashimi (to really taste the fish) and it was up to par. Even for a BYOW, the prices were very reasonable. I asked for a birthday cake and it was DELICIOUS - we really didn't expect that.

Service : the wait staff was very nice and professional. They served us quickly, they checked on us - which is somewhat a stretch for most byow. Kudos

Decor : simple chic. Asian flare but nothing over the top - just enough. Great job on the lighting  (bad lighting is one of my pet peeves so I had to mention that)."}
{"text":"An okay option in the neighbourhood for reasonably priced Japanese food that is more of a sit-down-and-enjoy-your-meal rather than quick-and-easy option like many in the city (that I've noticed) but the food itself is not amazing in my opinion. The ingredients weren't NOT fresh but they weren't of decent quality. Having said that, it is not a bad restaurant. Just not GOOD. The server I had was very lovely though, and my experience dining there was that much better because of her."}
{"text":"Food was great, server was outstanding! He was a friend of the owner and made us laugh all night! We stayed until closing! Parking is tough on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The BYOB factor doesn't matter to me since I don't drink. So it was down to the food. We ordered six items of sashimi and nigiri. The sea urchin was undoubtedly the worst I had ever had (the waiter stated that the bitter taste was because of chemical treatment since it wasn't live). The rest of the items (white fish, salmon, octopus, sweet shrimp, surf clam) were okay/decent to just okay in descending order. The surf clam was on the dry side. The prices are not all that competitive as two pieces of bitter sea urchin was 7.95 and two pieces of dried out surf clam were 4.95. The seafood soup was good but I won't be returning just for that."}
{"text":"Best sushi!! Very fresh. 
The rolls are creative as well. 
Their seafood miso soup is awesome!!! Packed with flavours!
Also, their unagi (eel) sushi is the best eel sushi I ever had!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"This is a great little gem, nice ambiance, great service, and the sushi is quality! I would've just liked a little more for the prices, but maybe My expectations have been skewed by all-you-can-eat joints and sushi shops . I recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for the first time with a friend. The restaurant itself is very nice, and I love the decor. It's a nice place for a date as its kinda fancy and its BYOW. I like discovering new sushi places, but I wouldnt go back here. Here's why:

It's pretty expensive(whatever you get) and for what you get, cause the portions are pretty small. We weren't even full after we ate, so we had to get more food from somewhere else. But the food is good though, their sushi is pretty fresh. 

Also the service was really slow. There was maybe 5 tables, and 4-5 waiters, so it didnt make sense that it was so slow."}
{"text":"This place is great. Always fresh and reasonably priced. And byob means great wine at SAQ prices! The service is cheerful and quick."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because my tastes have changed or because the quality of the place has gone down, but my most recent visit to this BYOW sushi restaurant left me hungry for sushi. 

The night stated out alright with the appetizers of salmon tataki and the grilled calamari. Both wear seared right and the accompanying sauces were tasty. But the sushi platter that came afterwards was disappointing. Rolls were heavy on rice and poor on fish. The sashimi slices were thin and the speciality roll we ordered lacked flavour. 

I love the BYOW concept but found that the quality of the sushi served doesn't do justice to the great bottles of wine you can bring to pair along."}
{"text":"great food with good price !!! one of my favorite BYOW in town !"}
{"text":"Went here as part of their re-opening (after fire damage), and had a fantastic meal.

I didn't see the place before, but the new look is good. It's fancy enough you could bring someone here to impress them, while still being a good spot for a bunch of friends to come, talk, and have a good time. There's a separate area at the back which would be good for bigger groups.

We had a special set menu (for the re-opening), and all of it was very, very good. I don't know where these guys are getting their fish, but it's the best I've had in Montreal. We had a lot of small taster dishes, and it was tough to decide on which I liked best: the soba noodles, the seared salmon, the butterfish, etc. They were all good interpretation of traditional Japanese dishes - not too far out to be something else, but different enough to make them interesting.

I was going to give the place a solid 4 stars, but then the final sushi plate came out, and it went to 5! It was the best sushi I've had in Montreal - seriously, I would come here over Park any day. It was all spot-on. The eel they served was the best eel I've best eel I've ever had, and I've lived in Japan in the midsummer (when there is a special day just for eating eel!)."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Montreal. Yuukai on Park Avenue, has only specialty rolls made from the freshest of ingredients. Forget about California rolls or Boston rolls. This is the best sushi for the price in MTL."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It smelled very fishy when we walked in. The staff was friendly, but the service was very slow and considering it was not busy at all. The rolls themselves are too big the rice too sticky and just more filler then fish. Very dissatisfying."}
{"text":"Trouver du bon sushi à Montréal, ça n'est pas la chose la plus facile à faire. Soit que les prix sont corrects mais les sushis sont aussi juste correct, ou bien on doit se vider le porte-monnaie pour un morceau de poisson qui a de l'allure. Ici, c'est vraiment le meilleur des deux mondes. Les prix sont bien raisonnables pour ce qu'on a et la qualité des sushis est simplement divine. La majorité des bouchées que j'ai prises fondaient dans ma bouche avec peu d'efforts et des milliers de saveurs. J'ai pu goûter à certains aliments que je n'avais jamais mangés auparavant comme de l'oursin. En plus, j'ai profité de la salle privée vers l'arrière qui peux accommoder des groupes d'environ une vingtaine de personnes. Le service était super bien et toutes nos questions ont été bien répondues. Définitivement sur ma liste de places à réessayer!"}
{"text":"The best byob sushi restaurant!
The ambiance is good,the sushi is delicious,the prices are fair and the service is great.love their specialties.its also in my favorite neighborhood (mile end).whether its for a casual date night or a big night out with friends this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Meh.
Pas mauvais, mais les meilleurs de Montréal ? J'en doute fortement.
Ou alors vous n'êtes vraiment pas difficile à Montréal =)

Environ 75$ pour 2, quantités suffisantes.

Dommage que Park était fermé le dimanche..."}
{"text":"If you are not a sushi fan like me and you need to take baby steps towards this world. That's a place to go. If you are a sushi maniac like my girlfriend and want to try something very different. That's the place to go. If you are anything in between, I think that's the place to go too :D."}
