{"text":"Ned's is pretty much a legend in Mesa, I have been eating there since I was in high school. The sandwiches are fantastic, make sure to add the vinegar and oil it's so tasty! Lunch specials include chips and drink at a great price. Friendly, family run business."}
{"text":"Went into Ned's earlier to purchase a couple combos and one other sub.  For example, this 8\" sub has one layer or slice of each meat.  This sandwich was to not have lettuce or tomatoes on it.  They did not put any cheese on the sandwiches either.  I trimmed away so much bread that had meat nowhere by it.  The pickle was really soggy too.  Not a good value and portions have been reduced.  Will not come here again.  See photos."}
{"text":"Excellent sammiches. Plain n simple, delicious. As good as jimmy John's but this place has nothing on CHEBA HUT.   The sandwiches are tasty, price is ok. This place beats subway any day."}
{"text":"Best subs, great service, good value. We moved to WA and I want to go back to AZ just to have a 12\" hot turkey on white with everything. Love the pickles too. Ned knows his samich!"}
{"text":"So much better than subway, fire house, Quiznos etc! Bomb bomb delicious!! Good service and very accommodating. Our all time favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Super tasty and a much better deal than the chain sub joints.  If you haven't tried it, you need to!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service,excellent food , thanks Ned for making the best party sub for my occasion. Would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"The food was tasty. But my boyfriend asked for none of that mayo miracle whip mix on my sandwhich. Im allergic to eggs and have been throwing up all morning. I guess we will have to double check everything we order..."}
{"text":"We love Ned's Krazy Subs!!! Not only are the \"samiches\" super tasty, prepared of quality ingredients in many varieties or as you like it, but they are also a great value, prepared fresh, served quickly, and the staff is always friendly. We love eating in because of the neighborly atmosphere, but you can also order on line and pick up in shop.  The most fun part is that - depending on the time of day - we can usually see Ned, himself, behind the counter or holding court in one of the booths...what a nice guy and what a friendly place to eat. Go...go now!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot to grab lunch, and contrary to what I've heard, you don't have to be LDS to eat there. J/K.  Great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Great local favorite sub shop. Simple and fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with these Krazy Sub places.  The subs are great, the service is just horrible.  It's the same at all of them.  I guess the owners are just cheap and don't want to pay people to work.  We're here at high noon, which last time I checked is the peak of lunch hour, and they have 1 person working up front and one person in back making sandwiches.  It's like they're daring us to see how lousy they can make their service and still get our business.  They do have the best subs, but JUST NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is packed... this is an old childhood spot.. been going here for over 30 yrs.. poorboy is all I ever order.. always stop by when in area.. special treat."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered a tuna sub and one bite. YUCK. It was so dry. Hardly any mayo, and so much pepper that I took a bite and almost choked. Took a look inside the sub and the tuna was literally BLACK in color. The pickle was old looking, but I didn't try it.  Took it back up front and explained. I really didn't want anything else, nor did the guy at the counter ask me if I'd like something else or to re-make the sub.  I was REALLY hungry and if he offered to make another one, I would have said yes. Instead he was busy trying to open the cash register. So I said, I guess I'll just grab my refund and go. He just looked MIFFED at me and shoved my refund at me on the counter. I told him \"You forgot to say sorry about that.\" And left. NEVER going back.  $6.05 for a small dry black pepper choked tunafish. It was 2pm and all the tables needed wiping too. POOR all the way around."}
{"text":"My husband had heard about Neds from a friend at work that raved to him about it, so one late afternoon driving back from Vegas we stopped for some sandwiches.. First off, the young teenage boy at the register was less than helpful & had about as much personality as a door nail. He was very short with me & being that this was our first visit, I asked how the chicken salad was, his response was, \"I don't know, I don't eat it.! \" Wanting to turn around & walk out based on his response, but being exhausted from driving 5 hrs I didn't have the energy to go some place else. Second, there were a couple families dining inside with small children, almost the entire time they were running back & forth kicking the service counter where I was standing trying to place my order. And that not being enough, they were screaming & yelling & play shooting at each other, I couldn't hear myself think.. The parents never said a word, as they continued to be menaces. Next, which I thought was quite hilarious is that when our order was ready, the same kid calls out \"Order #25!\" I was still standing at the service counter, I looked around thinking \"are there others who are waiting?\" Yeah, no he was shouting out my order for pickup!!! Really?? I felt like that scene from Meet the Fockers where the ticket agent won't let him board the plane until his seat is called, even though he's the only customer.. I couldn't help but laugh. Finally, the icing on the cake from this visit was the 2 days of volatile vomiting as a direct result of eating at Neds!! I got food poisoning, awesome! I had the chicken ranch sub, the ranch dressing was sour tasting, but I overlooked it being hungry & exhausted.. Sadly, after that one & only experience I cannot share the same enthusiasm with the other reviewers.  We will not be back. Word of advice for future patrons: Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Love Ned's, I've been coming here since I was a kid growing up in Gilbert (in the 80's!). Now I bring my wife and kids or do take out for a quick great meal for a great price!  We love Ned and his whole family! Marc Lemaire -Gilbert AZ"}
{"text":"Consistent and inexpensive Neds is a great place to go for lunch. The lunch special runs from 10-4 so there is plenty of time to pick up a cheap sub."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Simple sandwiches, good price.   Notthing gourmet, but not franchised cardboard either.  Always get the turkey sub with everything on it, cold, with a drink and some chips."}
{"text":"One of my all time favs. You can never go wrong getting something from Ned's. And the workers are all super friendly!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Ned's. My sons loved to go there for lunch when they went to Mesa High School. Ned's is a huge supporter of the high school. They provided subs for the basketball and volleyball teams for half price. They also bought advertising in all of the schools' programs. Ned's also provided subs for my son's Eagle Scout project for half price. Great staff and great service."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst service you could possibly get!!!!  They hire young kids that don't get it. I ordered 3 subs and was the only one sitting there waiting for 30 min. They chit chatted in the back for a bit, then finally noticed me sitting there and said they must of lost my order.   Best line of the day, \"oh it didn't go through, I will have to put it in again, but don't worry you don't need to pay again.\" Oh thank you, that is so kind of you not to charge me again for the order you lost.  On top of that, they then ran out of white bread. You are a sandwich shop!!! Who runs out of white bread?? That's like Starbucks running out of coffee and only having decaf. So my order wasn't even right.  I don't expect a refund, but at the least offer a cookie or something, not you don't have to pay again."}
{"text":"Ive been a regular at neds since the old location on southern and gilbert. Never disappointed by the food. The staff is usually some mormon kid up front and a couple chicks or a chick and a guy making the food. Im never impressed by the staff, but I enjoy the food and the pricing is not bad. Better than subway for sure"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ned's for a very long time & it's always been great until recently, I have noticed that the last few times I have been here the sandwiches are getting smaller & smaller. I am so disappointed in quality lately that I don't think I will be going back :( my most recent sub had literally 1 piece of meat on it."}
{"text":"I got to meet Ned! He's 73 and still working behind the counter.  I also got to hear all about the history of his store.... and how they've been around in Mesa since the 70's (although not in the current location that whole time).    The sandwiches are sandwiches... about what you would expect from any sub place-- a nice selection of options, white or wheat bread, and quickly made.  But what sets this apart in my mind is the people (person) behind it and the history.  I always love supporting a truly local business."}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighborhood my entire life but tried Ned's for the first time about a couple of weeks ago. It's a favorite around the area so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm typically not a huge sandwich fan but I actually thought it was pretty good. The hubs and I shared the super samich and it wasn't bad. The guy working was really nice and helpful so this past week I decided to grab one on my way into work. I called the order in but when I went to pick it up realized I had called the order into the location on Southern, not the location on McKellips. OOPS! The guy working was super nice about it and made me a new one right there, in just a couple of minutes! It was very fast, friendly service and I was surprised at how understanding they were about the mix up. I will definitely be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed by Ned's choice of staff lately. The last few times I've come in the ladies at the register have been rude and totally uninterested in what they are doing. This is the reason I haven't been in as frequently as I used to."}
{"text":"This place is so much better than Subway. It has a nice college style atmosphere on the inside; with a pin ball machine and various arcade games. The subs are excellent and are relatively inexpensive. My favorite is the meatball and the super duper."}
{"text":"Honestly, was not impressed. Employee taking order was short and rude. Overpriced for what I ordered. Better than subway but not nearly meeting the level of what I expected. It's supposed to be a local icon and favorite. I dunno...was not feeling it at all."}
{"text":"Me and the family where super disappointed we normally love Ned's but I went in to get 4 subs and they were all super soggy and 3 were missing the meat!! 1 was supposed to be warmed up but was barley even warm.. customer service needs work too!! Will mostly not be returning or referring!!"}
{"text":"I've been hitting up Ned's for several years and they do not miss a beat in making some of the best samiches in town. Their bread makes their sandwich however their pickles will make your DAY!  Go here, try any sandwich and take a whole pickle home - you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ned's is a great local sandwich shop.  I eat here regularly.  Nothing fancy,  this isn't Ike's,  just delicious sandwiches,  big bag of chips and drink for a reasonable price.  Don't let the location or lack of decor dissuade you from stopping in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave 1 star reviews but with the outcome tonight I felt I had to.  We ordered 4 club subs to go and when my son got home he had 3 subs and the worse part is one of the subs had no meat.  I can understand a little about missing a sub, and my son not counting before he left but not adding meat to a sub, that is just ridiculous.  Challenge is that we live a ways away and would be extremely out of our way to come back."}
{"text":"The sub is always superb, always good meat and bread and everything just works together. The restaurant itself feels homey, and Ned himself is often out chatting with his customers. However, the tables are often dirty, even when completely empty like today, and the service can be super slow."}
{"text":"It was okay. I got the 8\" and wasn't very impressed. It was skinny and pretty small. I had the BBQ beef and cheese. I didn't even taste the cheese."}
{"text":"Sandwich was mediocre. The bread reminded me of elementary school lunch. It wasn't busy so I don't understand why every available table was dirty."}
{"text":"I was turned on to Neds when I was in High School and am a fan. Its a good value. I believe the last time I went, an 8: sub with side and drink was like 5.00. Wayyy better than subway. I like just the traditional turkey sammich with lettuce, tomato, onion and lots of mayo. The reason they are not rated \"as good as it gets\" is because every time I have gone there, there is not enough mayo on the sammich. Make sure you ask for extra unless you want a dry sub. Their potato salad is terrific and might be the best I have ever had. The service is quick and friendly and the facility is clean but a bit plain. Give it a try if your looking for a new sammich spot.   PS: Their catering is great too. They always include everything and instead of giving little packets of mayo, mustard, oil, vinigar, they give you actual bottles.   :O"}
{"text":"This place must be making a fortune off of their bread & brown lettuce sandwiches. We ordered three sandwiches which came with the stingiest ingredients we've ever seen. An 8 inch had only three paper-thin, tiny pieces of pepperoni. A 12 inch had only one tiny, paper-thin slice of cheese. The meat & cheese was skimpy on all three sandwiches and sliced so thin you could see through it. The bread had weird black spots on part of it. There was enough lettuce on each sandwich to make a large salad except that it was brown. The pickles were bad. Unfortunately we didn't discover this until we got the sandwiches home and unwrapped them. Had we dined in, we would have returned them for a refund and left. Be forewarned--unless bread & brown lettuce ripoff sandwiches are your thing."}
{"text":"Something about Neds is just BETTER than any other sub place. The bread, the meats and cheeses, the mayo... Oh man. I can't get enough of Neds. Recently catered a party with them and (unknown to me) they'd accidentally shorted the meat on the platter (we still had leftovers) and they called out of the blue 2 days later telling me they had messed up and asking me if they could give me a gift card to make up for it! Who does that?? Amazing."}
{"text":"I really wanted a good sub today so I drove from Tempe to Ned's on my lunch break and it was definitely worth it! Got a Pastrami Samich and it was exactly what I wanted! Great taste, great quality, and great price!"}
{"text":"We always stop in at Ned's to grab sandwiches on our way to the lake or off-roading..We always look forward to these subs as everyone is super friendly and the subs are always yummy!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE sandwich place since I was a kid!!! I still love going here and taking my kids! The prices are very reasonable and you get a big sandwich!! Hum......... I want one now!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Great value sub sandwiches!! Love going here with a sweet location."}
{"text":"If you like Steve's Krazy Sub you will like Ned's Krazy Sub. They are brothers and have the same set up. Though I would like to comment on this location's bathroom! It's the basic single bathroom you would expect, but man does it smell good!! I walked in and was pleasantly surprised, I definitely enjoyed my experience there!"}
{"text":"I typically do not favor subs at all or crave them to say the least. I do not know how jimmy johns stays in business for example. The only thing decent there in my opinion is their bread which is not even phenomenal. Ned's Subs are up there with subway in my book.  Their Chicken sandwich tasted exceptionally fresh(my best word to describe the taste). I like Fresh things so works out perfect for me! We had stopped here randomly because we had thought the name was funny as we were driving through the parking lot looking for harbor freight.  Next time i am around this area i will again make my stop to try a totally different sub and then onto some fro-yo!  :)"}
{"text":"First visit Jan.16 2018. Service was prompt and friendly. Good menu options, selected BBQ Beef. Bread (key to any good sub) was fresh and tasty. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Overpriced subs, bread and meat has changed to low-grade. Same quality as subway, just a higher price tag. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Hasn't changed since I was in high school! Friendly service, clean, and old school atmosphere.  I always add mustard to my samie, ordered hot, and I suggest purchasing a bag of chips- put the chips into the sub and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife who was a regular growing up as a child. She was excited to show me a great sandwich spot that gave her so much joy growing up. It was a different story when I went there with her. I ordered the Pizza Boat Samich. It was underwhelming to say the least. When the menu said it had pepperoni, I didn't realize they meant 1 thin sliced of pepperoni, about a half teaspoon of sauce, and a small slice of cheese. It was basically 95% microwaved bread, even so, the bread was extra thin, as if they provide complimentary sandwich smashing service. I don't know what they are doing with the money they charge for the food, but it's not going toward the product. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm a loyal patron of Steve's Krazy Subs, so i don't want to get involved in a family rivalry.  However, sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless.  At first approach, Neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop.  Nice large dining area, clean, fancy tables (*more on those in a minute) I was glad to see that Neds had the same lunch special...8 in poorboy, chips and drink.$1 more at Neds, but you get bigger chips.  Tasted exactly the same, so tough to compare.  My only complaint is the booths.  Probably great if you are 6'5, but for common folk, pretty uncomfy."}
{"text":"Hard to wrong with Neds. They've been here forever and they're super nice people. Their samiches are consistent and exactly as promised."}
{"text":"Food is always great! Been eating here since I was kid. My parents have been eating here even longer. But they gotta stop hiring untrained or unsupervised teenagers. Service is getting so slow and less friendly."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful locally owned and operated sandwhich shop. Great unique style. Been going since I was in High School!"}
{"text":"The last time I went there they completely screwed up my internet order and there was barely any meat on any of the subs (I had ordered several for my family). I could have done better at a Subway."}
{"text":"Mesa staple!!! My fav place to grab a sub!! The hot pastrami or pizza boat is the bomb!!! My kids LOVE the soft pretzels with melted cheese in top! They also make awesome party subs & can do figure 8 subs for 8th birthdays!! Love them & Ned is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Love Ned's!! Best subs. My kids love the soft pretzels with cheese & the pickles!! My pick is the hot pastrami & my hubby goes with the pizza sub! This location is great for big gatherings!"}
{"text":"Good subs at an expected price.  This place is classic.  I used to walk here from my house when I was a little kid and get their pizza boat and play dig dug or spy hunter.  Not much has changed since then.  Just their prices and the arcade games."}
{"text":"Ive been eating at Ned's for years and it is by far one of my favorite sandwich shops! The price is fair and reasonable. I get on kicks where this place is what I crave, they are worth stopping in and grabbing a sandwich."}
{"text":"We ordered party trays for an event and had a miscommunication in ordering. When I showed up to pick up our order, we realized the error.   Ned's staff was very apologetic and quick to go above and beyond to accommodate us and fix the situation.   We were beyond THRILLED with their service and quality and won't hesitate to use them again and recommend them to others."}
{"text":"This place is... Okay. I've been here a few times. None of the employees are over 17-18, expert for the owner. It's kinda just a bunch of immature boys running this place. That's right, there are no girls here! The food isn't terrible. But it also isn't as good as jimmy johns. The most recent time I went I order a sandwich and forgot to add extra meat like I always do. So I go back up to the counter to pay/add extra meat and they tell me \"well it's too late. We can give you a side of meat? But we already made the sandwich.\" They weren't willing to put it on there for me! So I said forget it. Then while I was eating my meal the cashier was moping and told both me and my boyfriend to lift up our feet? Not asked, told. This one guy behind the kitchen window NEVER smiles. No matter how many times you smile at him."}
{"text":"good little sandwich shop.  i know it is hard to compete against the large franchise guys so i wish them luck.  the kids that work there need to increase their intelligence level a few notches.  and try putting a little more meat on the sandwich and less lettuce."}
{"text":"Many problems with this place.   Bread is chewy and NOT fresh.  Want pickles on your sandwich? 35 cents more. Black olives? 25 cents more.  I was nickle and dimed to arrive home and dig in to a very lack luster sandwich.  Sorry Ned, I won't be back."}
{"text":"After a crazy day of scrapbook shopping, I was in need of something good to eat.  I wanted to get something before I got on the expressway, and I saw this place from the road.  I am a huge sub fan, and knew I had to come in here.  The place is simply decorated, with crab stuff on the wall (so cute) and shiny table tops with a \"Neds Subs\" design.  Has a sub theme throughout.    The menu here is pretty impressive.  LOTS of variety to choose from, and they are cool with making any order to your liking.  Thier standard sizes are 8 inches and 12 inches, and the prices are fair and reasonable to what I get.  You can also order your sub hot OR cold! Hooray for choices!    I ended up getting an eight inch hot pastrami 8 inch sub combo.  It came with a bag of chips and a drink for something like $7.  NICE!  Food service was quick, and service was great.  I will gladly return here, as I really had a good experience.   Amazing food, great  pricing, delicious and one of a kind.  Worth going here anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Ned's Krazy Sub's during a lunch break and enjoyed the place. It is a small shop in Mesa and a great place to grab a sub. We even got to see Ned still working behind the counter!  The menu has a long list of your standard sub types to choose from on white or wheat bread and either eight or 12 inches. They have their standard toppings but you can add or remove whatever you'd like. After ordering, it doesn't take too long to have your sub up and ready.   The subs are pretty good! They come wrapped with a large pickle slice so if you don't like pickles, be sure to let them know in advance! The sandwich was nothing special but was flavorful and packed with good ingredients. I'd choose Ned's over your typical subway or home made sandwich any day! Pricing here was decent as well!   Overall, Ned's appears to be quite the long lived tradition and staple in the Mesa area. Ned still works behind the counter serving up quality, great tasting subs. Pricing is good for what you are getting and it exceeds the standard by most other sub places. Would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Neds has always been one of my favorites. I went to high school nearby and we always stopped here for lunch. Now whenever I'm back in Mesa it's on my list of places to go. It's location is not the best but the tables are always full and there are always families. This sub place is much better than any of the chains nearby. If you haven't been you need to try it!"}
{"text":"Family stopped in for dinner about 8:30. Girl working was friendly, food was made quickly considering there were 7 of us. Prices were very reasonable, less than expected. Sandwiches were good, better than expected for the price. If you're looking for a good sub at reasonable price, and want something different than (better in my opinion) subway, stop in and try one, youll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"It's been along while since I've had a sub from here. Used to love them. Today not so much. The person working the counter seemed like he would be having a better time pulling his toenails out than working.  Service was quick, but I was the only person there. Only white bread was available and it was stale. Also my tomatoes were pretty much frozen. Sandwich wasn't bad, but definitely a let down when you're really looking forward to something."}
{"text":"I grew up in this neighborhood. Ned's was and still is a staple of the community here. The food is good. The staff changes over a lot but the friendly feeling never goes away. Sometimes you'll go in and the owner will be eating lunch and chatting with the customers. It's like seeing a local legend. If you're in Mesa it's a sub shop worth visiting."}
{"text":"sub sandwiches that bring back the memories of younger days. I have had these for years and love em. Centrally located"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, food was decent.  Was not blown away by the sub, by any means, but the price was extremely reasonable.  Not something I see myself craving, but if I you're looking for a cheap and filling sub on the go, I'd recommend Ned's.  Less than $5 for an 8'' sub, $2 for a souvenir cup.  Can't beat that"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite sandwich joints on the planet and holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Decent subs. Decent price. Decent wait time. Not a assembly line type sub shop.  Nice to support local business so gets a 4. Also, each sub comes with a pickle, bonus!"}
{"text":"Their bread is so fresh and delicious! Their meatballs and marinara are satisfying, but nothing to write home about. They have good sandwich meat, as well as a good choice of drinks and sides. Very good prices, also. Seriously, though... Their super fresh bread is worth a trip alone!"}
{"text":"Weather it's Ned's or Steve's you can't go wrong ordering a Krazy Sub.  I've been coming to Ned's at this location for nearly 15 years, usually a couple times a week when I was in High School.  It's nice to know years later when I'm back in the neighborhood I can still enjoy those same flavors, it still taste great.  I think it has to do with that homemade bread, it's the perfect consistency and really makes the sandwich complete.  Lunch special is $7.50 which includes a 12\" sub, chips and a drink."}
{"text":"Ned's is such a great little sub shop.  I have been going to Neds for years.  It is a drive for me but their subs are worth it.  It isn't expensive at all and the staff is so nice.  Ned's is GREAT"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  After visitng two other \"little guy\" sub shops in the last two weeks, I am eager to try more!  Ned's Krazy Sub was the first I visited, and it was dynamite!  The vegetarian sub lunch special is my new best friend!  Delicious, fresh bread with excellent blend for the dressing makes this sub one you won't soon forget!  Cool decor, quick service, and delicious subs!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Ned's Krazy Sub since I was knee high to a grass hopper. I even worked for Ned when I was in high school.   After all these years I know what I'm getting cause the food and quality is still the same, and at fantastic prices too!   I loved it as a kid, now my kids love it too."}
{"text":"Ned's is a Mesa classic.  The lunch special is a generous amount of food for a good.  The teenagers working there are not the highest quality of service, but is still a great place to get a sub."}
{"text":"Decent but not earth shattering.  I like to go to mom and pop businesses so I decided to try this place out.  I got the 'Super Sub Samich' to go. I walked in and was greeted with a 'what can I get you' when I was checking out the menu. I told the counter person I had never been there and was looking.  I asked about a certain sandwich but the person at the counter had never tried it. I was told a couple sandwiches were 'popular' and tried the Super Sub.  I got potato salad too (generic not made there).  No real complaints except for this observation: sandwich shops are a dime a dozen. Frankly there are chains that are better than this place. While the service was quick and efficient, it was fairly cordial but not friendly. I suppose for a mom and pop business in a super competitive industry, I think friendly assistance with a smile would go a long way in getting repeat customers. You don't have to throw a big party when I show up but a perfunctory hello with a smile would be nice.   Look, the sandwich was pretty good but when there are better options from chains out there, a local place like this needs to try a little harder when they don't have that long to make a good impression with a new customer just looking for something to go."}
{"text":"Crazy Sub has been in my sandwich rotation for about 30 years, BUT, (yes, there's always a big but) while it once was high on my list of good food/good value places, lately, it has sunk way down. On my most recent visit, my sandwich was so lacking in everything that I wondered what they did with the  $7 plus that I paid for it. It had hardly any meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes or anything else that would add flavor. It was like eating a dry hunk of bread. It was the kind of sandwich that made me long for Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Really good subs...the customer service was lacking.  My son and I went in and interrupted the cashier's long conversation about pool repair with another customer.  I would return, service needs some guidance."}
{"text":"this is my hubby's favorite sandwich place during his high school days...he introduced this place to me since we're married, and I love this place a lot! I met the original owner, Mr. Ned..he is a very nice and down to earth man. You can tell that this was created out of his love and passion. What's cool about this place is you can see people coming over here with their families or girlfriends/boyfriends..it's obvious, like my husband, it's their favorite too and have their families or loved ones come over and get to enjoy the taste they've grown to love since their teenage years.  As for their food service, it's great. We would always come over here every time we visit my inlaws in Mesa.  We highly recommend for you to give this place a try."}
