{"text":"Setting: It was really late (past midnight) on a Saturday evening. We left a pub nearby after having enjoyed some snacks and drinks. We stumbled upon Taco Monkland. My friend had heard about it - and says \"Want a taco?\"  Now, let's be honest - what kind of friend would I be if I had said no to a taco? Lol. So naturally, out of friendship, we tried Taco Monkland.  Perusing through their taco menu there were a few options. The classics. I opted to try the following tacos: Steak, Chorizo, and Al Pastor.   Verdict: They were really good! The meats and flavours were on-point. They were small, unpretentious and reminiscent of Mexico street food. You know, the simple delicious handheld goodies. My friend and I were impressed.  A tip (because we didn't know the first time around): Condiments for the tacos are inside - and are self-serve! Yup. They hand you the hot tacos with just the freshly made meat (or veggies - there was a cactus option). You then add the condiments (onions, cilantro, pineapple, and sauces) you want. Did I mention self-serve pineapple?! YUM!!  Oh - and a last tip: There are complimentary homemade tortilla chips inside as well! These were delicious! Fresh, crispy, homemade.  Overall, this place is a yummy solid choice. It's authentic and unpretentious. It's got soul. And it tastes delicious. Stop by for a taco (or a few) in your in the area. Support this local business!"}

{"text":"Place is small. Small terrace not very comfortable. Good taco though but the service is very long for 6 tacos.... be ready to wait if you want to eat taco."}
{"text":"This is more of a fast food place than a sit down restaurant. You can sit outside. They don't sell bottled water but can offer you cups of water.  I ordered 1 fish taco and 1 chicken taco. All dressed means with cilantro, onion and lime, so I got that. They have the option of spicy or not spicy sauce.  It's pretty authentic Mexican food. And they use corn tortillas that they import. The chef, Alex, is from Mexico.  It was really good. I would need more than 2 tacos to fill me up though.  It's a good place for a good quick taco.  Not expensive."}
