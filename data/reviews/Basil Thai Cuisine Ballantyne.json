{"text":"Excellent service and food. The best Pad Thai I have ever eaten. The basil rice rolls were excellent as well as the jasmine tea. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Thanks for having gluten free options for those of us with food allergies. We will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Terrific fresh tasting Thai food. Get the Basil Martini, Basil rolls, the Basil shrimp fried rice, the shrimp are so tender and perfectly cooked. The Crispy Curried Fried Duck is killer!"}
{"text":"Went to basil in Stonecrest for first time last night. They said wait would be 15 minutes but was more like 30-35. We finally got seated and waited 15 minutes for waiter to come to table. He apologized but was very short with us and was clearly overwhelmed. Food was average. As I was eating I overheard other patrons complaining how bad their service was. At one point I counted 7 dirty tables with no one cleaning up. Don't think I will be back anytime soon. So many better places in charlotte now."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because of the cleanliness of the restaurant. I could have given 5 stars based on the Pad Thai. It was our first visit here and the restaurant has lovely decor and beautiful rustic wooden tables. However most of the plates that were on the table were not clean and then once the waitress removed them to switch them out, I noticed at least 3 sticky/not clean areas on the table. NOT acceptable in any restaurant that has the kind of prices Basil Thai has. I chose not to say anything as we had company and I did not want to make a scene. The food was good and we will go back because of that but please, hire staff that has an eye for a clean table."}
{"text":"Amazing food, kudos to the Chef, just a shame the evening was spoiled by a waiter who was not interested in serving our table.   We loved the basil wraps, chicken pad Thai and curry dish.  The waiter didn't take our drink order, we had to track down another waiter after a long wait.  Then we had to ask if we could place a food order, getting the impression our waiter wasn't interested in serving us.   Please note, the place was half empty.   Hmmmmm......"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. Real went above and beyond to take care of you. Pad ka prow was excellent."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Charlotte! We always sit at the chef's counter to watch the food being prepared - it's really interesting to watch the time spent on hand rolling the fresh rolls and other items. The Pad Thai is the best I've had in Charlotte (I used to live in Seattle where Thai is everywhere so I like to think I know good Thai anyway...). The Basil chicken is also a favorite - very flavorful! The service is very pleasant and welcoming. Outside of the quality food and service, I really appreciate that you can customize the food how YOU want it. Don't want peanuts? Want to add onion? No problem!  What's the one thing you have to order? The fried wontons. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We have eaten both lunch and dinner here a total of at least 6 times.  The food is unique and above average.  Unfortunately , the service has consistently ranged from rude to indifferent. I promised myself that i would actually walk out the next time i experienced  such a lackluster attitude .  Others in Ballantyne have had similar experience .   They choose to return because of the food and the fact that it is the best Thai experience in the area .  Others with less patience and higher service standards may choose to dine elsewhere.    Tonight we waited more than 10 minutes at a table with no acknowledgement from wait staff that repeatedly walked by us without so much as making eye contact .  We returned the favor by walking out and enjoying a fine dinner elsewhere .  I advised the manager of our decision . He eventually apologized and I hope he takes the opportunity to educate his wait staff or take this act where it may be better appreciated."}
{"text":"Pricey but the absolute best Thai food in Charlotte.  The Masaman curry is the best dish on the menu. I try to eat here as often as I can."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Basil last night. The food quality was beyond what we expected. We will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"Ok so this was our second experience at basil in stonecrest. The service was not good at all. The servers are cold and not friendly at all. The portions are small and for the price they should be bigger. But I guess when your a chain restaurant this is expected. We will continue to eat Thai food at Thai first in Blakeney. Were the servers are nicer and the food is better."}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews here where people referenced bad service/food and honestly...I just don't get it. My wife and I are very picky and we absolutely loved this place. Everything was great. Service, food, hostess, everything! Meredith was an amazing waitress! Manager made sure to stop by to make sure we were happy. Will definitely be going back here :)"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best Thai food in Charlotte!  I have yet to try a dish that I did not like.  My favorites are the Nam Sod, Chicken Satay and Pad Thai (best I've ever had!!).  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice since it opened and both times I have been blown away.  Delicious!  Service was solid, ambiance was good.  I had the Pad Kee Mow with chicken and it was out of this world.  The wontons are great as well as the wonton soup.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Today, we decided to go to basil for my daughter's 16th. We've always gone to this location and have had okay food. The food was terribly bland and the manager talked back when we said our chicken was uncooked. Very disappointed and don't see myself coming again to this location*"}
{"text":"Really good Pad Thai, spring rolls, and hot tea. Prices are a bit high, but understandable given the high rent district they are in. Very attentive service. If you get it to go they do a nice job of packing it for you. Overall, really good option for Thai in the Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great quality Thai cuisine. Service is sometimes slow, which can be frustrating. You feel like you have to trip a waiter sometimes to get things. But the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"A few weeks have passed and thought I would give Basil another try. It seems as if they are getting back on their rails. In my previous review, I was very critical of the overall experience and lack of consistency compared to the flavors served at their other Charlotte location. This time around, the food/flavors were good. I order the same crispy red curry duck, the duck was cooked and more tender than the pervious. Also the spice was tack on! They could afford to put a little more sauce on the plate but it was fine nonetheless. Overall, glad that this particular Basil is not a bust; thankful it's closer to the homestead!"}
{"text":"For the price, I definitely expected better quality.  The basil rolls that we started with were 90% noodle, had one small shrimp, and a scant assortment of vegetable.  The curry that I had was watered down with coconut milk. Barely the texture of curry.  Overall, I think the service was mediocre, the food is definitely not worth the price, and the  visible fingerprints all over the silverware, cups, and plates was a bit unnerving.   PS: Why are we having 80s classic rock playing? Strange."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place (and I've tried them all in Charlotte)!  Both locations are delicious!  It's a little on the expensive side and they aren't very liberal with the spice so make sure you get Thai hot if you actually like it spicy but definitely worth the extra effort and dollars due to overall flavor!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant.  The chicken satay is perfect - we get it every time and always love it!  My go to dish is the pad see ew and its just perfect each time I order it.  Their signature cocktails are pretty delicious as well.  The decor is so cute and pretty - I love dining in here.   All of the waitresses we've had have been very friendly and attentive.   They don't take reservations except for large groups, so it can be quite a wait on weekends, but you can always get take-out as another option."}
{"text":"Location is in a great - perfect for a date night. There's a wine place, ice cream and movie theater nearby. The food at Basil is okay- not bad but not fantastic. Portion sizes are okay as well- not as big as other Thai places in the area. The atmosphere is nice and the staff is nice. May visit again if in the area but wouldn't make a special trip to eat here."}
{"text":"I LOVE thai food.  Being from Hawaii, I have had some good stuff.  And i love sticky rice.  We saw great things about this place and decided to stop in.    We had Larb with minced meat,  red Thai curry and pad Thai. I love that they use all white chicken. My husband likes things a bit more spicy so they offer a spice tray. I love my shoyu, so we got that as well.  I was a little disappointed that they did not serve sticky rice,  which is a staple in Hawaii. Does not cost more,  just a different way of cooking.  It's great for dipping,  especially into curries.   Otherwise,  fantastic place.  Renee was awesome.  Clean,  classy and tasty"}
{"text":"The food was good. That is what my wife and I told the man who asked us how our time at the restaurant was when we left.   To be honest the food was okay and that is why I give this review three stars but the service was terrible.  The service was rushed and rude.  The waitress seemed to think that reciting a draft beer list at warp speed was cute or helpful (Saints preserve us if she thought it she was being helpful).  Ordering was a very rushed and stressful experience that I would ordinarily associate with being at the Varsity in Atlanta GA.  I kept thinking we came here for a nice leisurely meal with our precious alone time and whoops there goes the waitress sprinting from the table before I could add an appetizer to the order.  (Seriously she did not even try to up-sale us from water when we sat down originally, let alone ask us if we wanted an appetizer)   It doesn't get any better from that point.  She forgets the beer order.  Splashes it over the table when she brings it over.  We decide at that point that we rather leave and inform another waiter of our intention but he asks us to stay and will talk to the waitress.  We had hoped that meant that we had seen the last of her at our table but no she comes back over to almost spill a drink on us. (Only soaked the the plate which was gratefully finished at that point).  (She never spilled drinks before she tells us).  Anyways I enjoy eating at places where our patronage is welcomed and wanted.  Obviously this is not that place and we do not intend to go back."}
{"text":"Traveling for business, I arrived here about 20 minutes 'till closing, and you could tell the staff was more interested in getting the place cleaned up to go home, than they were in being attentive to customers.  We were seated promptly, our drink and appetizer orders taken.  The server came back with our drinks and we ordered our dinners.    By the time the appetizers had come out, it was closing time.  The food was shortly thereafter and the server quickly went off to do his thing...  except he didn't bother to tell us it was already past last call.  Another 20 minutes went by and I had to flag our server down to get our drinks refilled which was when he told us that last call had been at 9PM but he would see what he could do.  My server apologetically returned with a half glass of wine for me, on the house.  I suppose if we had come earlier in the evening this would not have been an issue at all.  The food was very good, the service was \"meh\" and the \"last call\" fiasco was just strange.  If I am traveling in the area and stop by again I hope I get to arrive at a more reasonable hour so as to get better service."}
{"text":"My friend and I stepped out for a quick bite to eat. Neither of us were impressed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great service for 6 of us. We had a variety of appetizers and main entrees: chicken, beef, and shrimp. All were perfectly cooked and the vegetables were delicious. Great sauces- not americanized!! The manager was especially accommodating for several special requests."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have found a delicious Thai restaurant in Charlotte.  The dining area is very open, however, the noise level was low so we didn't have any problem carrying on a conversation while eating.  The décor is very nice, but the atmosphere is casual.  And the chairs are super comfortable.   There were three in our party.  We started with the fried wontons...talk about addictive.  The wontons were small in size, but a perfect portion to share between three people.    My husband started his meal with a bowl of the Tom Kha Gai.  Our waitress warned that the soups served at dinner are meant to be shared between two people, so he ordered the soup anticipating to take home leftovers, which we did.  The only flaw with the soup was that there was a lot of broth and not a lot of vegetables.  Other than that it had a very nice aroma and was very flavorful.    For our entrees we ordered the Pad Prik, the Basil Tilapia, and the Pad Thai.  We chose to share all three.  The sauce for the Pad Prik was dynamite.  It had enough spice that it didn't need anything added to it.  The Basil Tilapia was very mild but wonderful flavor.  The Pad Thai was also mild, we asked for a medium spice but it still needed a kick.  They offered three spices: Siracha; Chili Powder, and a Garlic Chili Paste.  The Garlic Chili paste was a wonderful addition to the Pad Thai.  Our waitress was very helpful and attentive.  All and all we had a wonderful experience and are happy to recommend Basil Thai to anyone.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that as a Thai restaurant they don't have Thai Iced coffee in the menu."}
{"text":"Basil Thai some of the best Thai food in the Queen City. I have never had a bad dish when I've eaten here and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good Thai food. I have just begun eating Thai, so I am still somewhat cautious in ordering. But I have enjoyed their Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles immensely. When I am uptown, Basil Thai is always in my top two considerations for where to eat. I'm happy to see there is another location, since there is often a long wait uptown. This location had the same quality as what I was used to at the original location, and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai spot in the QC. We are from BIG cities with BIG taste and flavor when it come to food. It has been a journey nailing down our favorite places to eat in the QC and when it came to Thai we were lost UNTIL we ran across Basil in UPTOWN. This new location is much closer to our home which is a plus and we made it a priority to check it out to see if it compared.  This place is pretty popular so it's best to call and make reservations in advance or be prepared to WAIT. I dislike the fact that they are NOT on OpenTable which is negative in my book as I like convenience and reservations at my fingertip. This goes for both locations.  The restaurant is pretty trendy and romantic at the same time. You can go with friends, colleagues, family or on a romantic date. This place allows for all of those scenarios and then some.  The food is very tasty from the apps to the main courses. We've had the fresh shrimp basil rolls and for our main course we had our usual \"BAsil Fish\". This dish is so flavorful and this location did not disappoint."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I've been many times and have had most items on the menu. Everything is soooooo good and it is not greasy. The Prik King, Basil, Yum Yai Salad, Veggie Delight and Pad Se-Eu noodles are just a few of my favorites. This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZINGGGG...we love the fried wontons and cashew chicken. Alejandro is one of their best! We only sit with him Bc we know we get 5* service every time! The manager Tan, is wonderful and so friendly - we love seeing him there and will continue to go back :)"}
{"text":"The table was shaky and I requested the waiter we be moved to a different table. The restaurant was practically empty and we could've been moved any where but he said he had something to fix it and there was still nothing that was done for the whole meal.   The chicken satay was raw in the center. We chewed and spat it out but on one bothered to ask us what's wrong they food was just left at the table each time and the waiter quickly waited away without giving us a chance to re-mention the table or tell him the started was undercooked.   My husband had the fried rice, we were told by the waiter initially that it's the best in Charlotte. I've had better a simple take out restaurants.  I had the green curry it was ok. Nothing exceptional.  I do not recommend nor will I visit ever again."}
{"text":"I'm finding many of the other reviews pretty disappointing.  If you go to ANY Thai Restaurant and order Pad Thai...then you probably shouldn't be eating Thai Food in the first place.  I've been to countless Thai restaurants all over the country (and outside the US as well) and this place ranks among the very top.  Great ambiance, terrific service, and our food (and cocktails) were a perfect blend of \"gourmet\" Thai.  Overall it was a tad spendy, but we are excited this restaurant is close by and will visit again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! We sat at the bar and ate.  It was fun to talk and watch all the activity  great service.   They have a few locations in Charlotte and South Carolina.  Friendly service and fast!! Order the Soup!! It is a must!! Serves 2.  Coconut chicken soup.    All fresh ingredients    Full bar    We will be back.   Friday and Saturday nights enjoy live music outside near restaurant"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Basil Thai uptown a couple of times and had great experiences there, so I was excited when I learned they were opening a location in StoneCrest.   I recently was at Polished getting a mani after work, and decided that instead of cooking dinner when I got home, I would just pick up some take-out instead.    I went over to Basil and placed an order to go and had a glass of wine at the bar while I waited. I forgot the name of the wine, but it was an Australian Sauvignon Blanc that was very quaffable.  It was either $8 or $9 for a glass, which is a typical price-point for that quality of wine in this area. The pour was somewhat generous, so that is a plus.   When it came time to order, I did not see Penang Curry, which is one of my favorite dishes at the Thai House.  I mentioned it to the bartender since I was placing my takeout order at the bar.  She commented that Penang Curry is \"not really Thai, it is more Indian\". Huh...really?  Not sure about that but I just let it drop, and ordered Red Curry with chicken instead.   My order was ready pretty quickly, so as soon as I finished my glass of wine, I went home to dig into dinner. Truthfully, I was a bit disappointed in it. They were not overly generous with the chicken and the red curry was ok, but a bit on the bland side. (I had ordered it as medium spicy, not mild.)  It contained bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and basil... but overall was not really that flavorful and did not satisfy my Thai craving.   I do think they are priced a little higher than some of the local competition - I think my total for 1 glass of wine and 1 entrée was between $26-28.  I don't mind paying a little more if their food blew the others out of the water... but based on this visit, that is just not the case.   Unless they give me  a really compelling reason to go back, next time I have a craving for Thai, I will more likely go back to Bahn Thai instead."}
{"text":"Such tasty food! Had a wonderful very attentive wait staff.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and super friendly.  The food came out in perfect time...hot and delish.  My son is home from college and had not had Thai food before. He was blown away at the main duck dish."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and maybe this was an off night, but my experience was meh.   Came here with a group of people for work dinner, as I had good memories of the food and ambiance. The setting is nice, special shout out to the plush chair seat that felt like sitting on cloud. The food left much to be desired.   I ordered shrimp and barrundi - and my shrimp was undercooked, and obviously undercooked just from the coloring of the shrimp. The other entrees we got: duck, fish, seafood stew were okay.  The desserts were disappointing to say the least. First of all they said the mango sticky rice was out of season. Seriously? I was just at Harris Teeter and there were mangos on sale. I don't think Basil Thai is a fancy place that calls only for specific mangoes imported from Thailand! I've had Bahn Thai mango sticky rice a month ago, and they didn't have any trouble making it \"off season\".   The fried ice cream was also disappointing. The dough was lukewarm; it tasted as if the balls were deep fried earlier and put in a fridge somewhere. We came here excited for the desserts and needless to say left quite disappointed."}
{"text":"They have went up on their price and did not bother to update any of the menus online. Spoke with the The manager and he stated he's only doing what he's been told. And he said can go ahead and cancel the order if I want, what are you gonna do Turn around and give it to the next customer?Not very good customer service. I guess I have to find a new Thai spot"}
{"text":"Good food - great atmosphere - we had a great server, however he spilled my beer all over my friends pants.  Pretty much ruined his night.  I would expect them to comp SOMETHING as a gesture of apology, but they didn't do anything except say they were sorry and bring out soda water to clean it up.  The whole front of his shorts were covered with my beer, come on - anything comped would have made a huge difference in the visit...  Won't be going back there....."}
{"text":"I went to Basil Thai last week and had been very excited about it. I ordered a cocktail that didn't have much liquor in it, which I guess I'm used to at this point..its so common. Pad Thai was pricey. The chicken tasted funny to me, and my friend agreed, and I gave up on relaying this to our waiter because he was MIA most of the time and I was so hungry...I ate the noodles only. I then told the waiter when he finally came back and he didn't appear to care about my complaint. So I just won't go back, thats all."}
{"text":"When I arrived in Fort Mill, this place was so hyped I literally thought it was God's gift of thai cuisine. Everyone I talked to raved about the food, the service, and the decor among other things. Having had some pretty legit thai food myself, I braced myself. Coming into the restaurant looks very impressive. A very modern decor with an incredible bamboo-wood-thing ceiling. The lighting is perfect and it's not too loud even when crowded. However, that didn't deter my disappointment in all other aspects of the restaurant.  - Service The service is on and off. They are great when taking your order, getting your drinks/food in a reasonable time, and answering questions, but fairly slow when you need something like another drink, ordering additional items, or basically getting their attention when they aren't intending to come. The owner is very nice though.  - Food Here's where the bulk of my smh experience comes in. I ordered the Pad Thai the first time I went and then the Pad See-eu the second time. Both were extremely dry, lacked flavor, and generally just tasted like it came out of the microwave. We had some shrimp and chicken appetizers, both not impressive, as well as some curries around the table which were decent but nothing spectacular. One cool thing is that they have a spice tray which is a nice presentation, but they are just basic spices that don't really add anything distinct (which is something you would expect from a place like this).  Overall.. The only reason I came back a 2nd time is because someone insisted we go, but otherwise I will never come back again."}
{"text":"In all this time here we finally got around to going Thai at Basil Thai.  The interior is huge.  I could envision parties or special occasion events being easily accommodated.  And it is more elegant atmosphere than most other of the Thai restaurants in the Charlotte area.  Menu does cover the waterfront so-to-speak, offering lots of variety.  Curries are only three, but we had the red which was just fine, loaded with beef (you can have other meats) and plenty of sauce to get soaked up by the rice.  The other two curries are green (with eggplant and green peas) and Masaman, which has potatoes.  Noodle dishes, stir fries, salads (that looked very large as they were carried by for other tables), soups (we had the yummy chicken coconut = excellent) and specials (which we highly recommend you try).  Spice is not a major part of their preparation, even if you ask for it to be spicy.  Instead, you get a selection of condiments, like the powder that is used, tiny REALLY HOT red peppers in liquid (?) and a smushed salsa of red peppers what goes really well with most all dishes and is tolerable heat-wise.  Nice wine list with plenty of by-the-glass selections.  Nice seafood items that are unique.  Service excellent.  A pleasure to come here."}
{"text":"Ate lunch with three Asian buddies and we all found it to be just fair at best. All of our portions were undersized and overpriced. The food itself was not spectacular. Two of us ordered the curry and I ordered the Pad Thai.   Service was unenthusiastic, classic rock blared over the speakers and throw rugs were worn and nasty.  Will not return. Too many better choices in town."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Basil Thai for years now. I don't live near either location in Charlotte but for my birthday lunch I opted for a trip to Ballantyne. Wonderful over the top service. Beautiful decor. I had the pad woon sen hot with chicken. It still wasn't hot enough for me so I had to add spice. Delicious either way. My lunch companion wants to come back for his birthday."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see we had a Basil Thai near us since I have gone to the one in uptown charlotte and I was impressed back then. Now just slightly bummed. The place is clean which is a plus. The waitress we had was very sweet too but we finally got a refill on water towards the end of our meal so that took off a star. Secondly the meals my mother and I had both the green and red curry dishes, well for the price you pay I felt like the portion was a joke. We had more sauce than meats and vegetables. Rice portion could have been a little more too. I did like the flavors overall but I wasn't impressed with the dish. Never had a problem in the Basil Thai in uptown charlotte with the portion. Not sure if I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"I have been here three times, and every time was good.  Great service, only downside is very pricey for Thai"}
{"text":"The interiors and decorations on the walls are so good that the moment you enter the door I bet you would be staring around like a lost dog! The lighting is cool and soothing and best ambiance for a date night. The furnishings and chairs are also really exquisite like a really expensive restaurant! The menu is mostly a basic Thai menu with some special dishes on the center page (which costs 25$+, not within my price range). We made some entree orders of Basil Chicken, Vegetable Delight and Cashew Nut which came in quite some time. We were given a common bowl of rice to share which you can ask for more if needed. My dish was particularly bland and without salt. I didn't want to humiliate the waitress so just asked for Salt but it was still not very nice and disappointing dish. I may come here again but will still hold back because of that one tasteless and saltless Basil Thai Chicken I still remember."}
{"text":"We spent $34 on dinner, and we are still hungry.  We did carry out.  The Pad Woon Sen filled half of the container and had very few vegetables in it.  The red curry with chicken was supposed to have extra bamboo shoots and no bell peppers, instead it just had no bell peppers.  Everything was very skimpy, but flavorful.  We enjoyed the taste until I noticed that my chop sticks had mold growing down the entire length of them.  Yikes!  We called the restaurant to tell them, and the hostess who answered was quite nice and yet seemingly ineffectual as she did not ask for us to bring the moldy chopsticks back or if we wanted a refund.  I say stick with Thai House on Hwy 51--always delicious, fresh and plenty of food in the dish!!!  I will try to post a picture of the chopsticks when I figure out how to do that..."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for dinner. Have been to the one in Charleston and Uptown Charlotte. Went for dinner on a Thursday evening. The place was deserted. Bar was empty as well. The bartender was actually the manager for the evening. There seemed to a very steady stream of people picking up takeout. Dinner was great. Basil roll appetizer was light and refreshing. I would recommend any of the three locations but this one is a nice option if you want to avoid the hassle of uptown parking and traffic. They also have an outdoor patio that I am sure is nice in the spring and summer."}
{"text":"We went here late at night about 30 minutes before closing but they accommodated us.  We ordered Pad Thai & it was DELICIOUS!!  It was so much food,  we shared the meal.  Service was great also.  I will return again!"}
{"text":"While exploring my new area I stopped into Basil and it was a great experience. The thai food was on point plus they had the sauces you can add to up the flavor.   Casual atmosphere Very nice decor but not over the top Bartenders were nice, great drink selection. Furthermore Sake variety was on point.  Fried wonton very different from what I've ever had Manager/owners are approachable and care about your experience   Definitely worth a visit, it'll be my neighborhood go to for certain"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and the food is hit or miss. The uptown location is my favorite. I have tried red curry, pad kee mow and a couple drinks. Everything tastes okay, nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to have a little girls' night of thai food & cocktails and she suggested we try this place out. Basil is located in the extremely suburban enclave of Stonecrest but don't hold that against them too much.  Reservations were made for a Friday evening (5-8-15) and we arrived with plenty of seating options to choose from since it wasn't busy. They have a nice outdoor patio that is flanked with lighting so that it a great option on a nice night. Even though it was beautiful night, we chose to sit inside.  Basil is decorated incredibly chic with an impressive entryway and I even found myself having floor-envy. I love a dark wood floor!  But I digress....As I waited for my friend to arrive, I heard a couple of other diners mention how good the food is there. Once my friend arrived, we asked our waiter to suggest a cocktail. I was having a difficult time deciding because they have a list of yummy-sounding cocktails. Since we were going the classic pad thai route, he suggested the pineapple mojito because it goes well with the combination of flavors. Once it came out, I had to pace myself to not suck it down so quickly because it was so good. I love a mixed-well cocktail and the folks at Basil Thai know a thing or two about doing that well.  I ordered my chicken pad thai on the mild heat spectrum and once it came out, I wish I had increased the heat a bit more. I love a little spice. The dish was very good, so good that I found myself craving more of it over the weekend. I had shoveled all it down so there was no chance of leftovers. With this pad thai, I found the ingredients were very fresh which brought out the traditional flavors of the meal more.  Overall, Basil is a good spot for celebrations, date nights, etc or to grab a drink if you find yourself tired of the soccer mom scene in Stonecrest."}
{"text":"So excited that Basil has finally opened in Stonecrest! A girlfriend and I visited around 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday night. I was worried about getting a table since they're not on Open Table and there was no mention of reservations on their website, but we got right in.   I don't remember much about the inside of Jojo, but my friend said the layout is basically the same. Much like the uptown location, it's a warm shade of light green inside with plush-looking chairs, dark brown tables, and flowers/bamboo sprinkled around. We were seated at a two-person booth, but most of the dining area was tables.  Our waitress was really helpful, steering us in a good direction to start with the Nam Sod ($6.95) instead of the Lard. We got the chicken version, and it was so refreshing! I didn't realize they were technically lettuce wraps, so I just ate the inside.  For dinner, I was boring and went with the pad thai ($15.95), which is a little sweeter than some, but I like that. My friend got the green curry ($14.95) and said it was really good.  We each got two glasses of wine, split the appetizer, and my bill was right around $38 with tip - not too shabby! Great addition to the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"I wonder if they are under new management. I have eaten here several times over the last couple of years and the experience had been good. Recently, we made a reservation for a bday dinner for a party of 6 on a weeknight. When 2 of us arrived on time, they still needed to clean our table. Within 5 min, our party had arrived except for one person (a new mother who had a newborn at home and was running a little late- but on her way). They refused to seat us. They were unapologetic. The manager kept saying it was his owners policy and he couldn't put his job on the line. I understand rules, but come on. 5/6 people were there and one person was on her way.  1.  You should state your policy over the phone when taking the reservation for a party of 6.  2.  What is the point of being a manager if you cant make a common sense decision that having one last person walk in 5-10 min after you seat everyone is better than losing a party of 6 on a weeknight?  Aside from their unwillingness to accommodate, their attitude was unfriendly.  Needless to say, I was disappointed in the manager and his hostess.  I met the owner a couple of times when they first opened and the only explanation i can think of is that this restaurant must be under a new owner."}
{"text":"Everything I have had has been delicious. The wonton soup is some of the best I have had, the shrimp summer rolls are just what you would expect. The beef salad is delicious etc very fresh tasting and the staff is really great"}
{"text":"I have been a long-term fan of the basil in uptown so I was excited to see there was one very close to our new house! This restaurant is amazing, always great service, awesome ambiance, and the PAD THAI. Every time we've come here the owner or manager has stopped by and we always feel very appreciated. My favorite dinner place in stonecrest, yum!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit to this restaurant!  The food was absolutely delicious with so many vibrant flavors!  The ambiance was really nice, and Howdy provided great service with some wonderful recommendations. The portions aren't huge and makes it a great place for sharing some different dishes. We particularly enjoyed the basil rolls, egg rolls and wontons for appetizers. We also really liked the volcano shrimp, green curry shrimp, pad Thai and pad see you noodles."}
{"text":"Great Thai place. Beautiful decor and great service.  Had the traditional Pad Thai here and definitely will come back again and again..  little on the pricey side though..."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the hostess to waiter. Alejandro was our waiter, very helpful and he recommended his favorites on the menu. We were satisfied with our food. I'd give Basil a 4-4.5 on their rating because it's not 100% authentic Thai food, so the flavors are not as infused as much. The Pad Thai was a bit bland. The Pad See Ew was a bit too greasy for me, but flavor was good. Our desert was great."}
{"text":"First time here with my dining mate and another couple. Nice atmosphere, very attentive friendly service. Our Thai waitress willing to suggest and explain the menu. Menu features traditional as well as Thai specialties. Everything from soups, appetizers, salads, meat, poultry and seafood choices as well as vegetarian cuisine plus specialty desserts. We ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce, chicken coconut soup, main courses: Basil Duck, Pad Thai with shrimp,  and chicken with ginger sauce. Food came out hot, good portions, plated nicely. Menu on the pricey side. Everything was very tasty and delicious. Duck and chicken tender. We ordered low spicey  flavor. Especially apealing was   the soup and how it was presented ( flamed serving vessel ) plus  great flavor. So a very enjoyable dinner. We would come back again."}
{"text":"First time I was here about a year ago, service was great, food was great. Now I come at a non-busy time, and the service was terrible. The waiter was at our table only twice for our drinks and order, did not even bother checking to see how our food was, gave a terrible attitude, and there was barely any customers. This place has gone completely downhill. If I am going to pay $15 a plate, I expect a more attentive and friendlier staff."}
{"text":"We've dined here and had take out. It's always fantastic when you can taste how fresh the food youre eating is. Spring rolls, fresh rolls, soups.... it's all delicious. Plus their pad thai comes standard with chicken and shrimp :) Entree portions are more than enough for one person so we always share and have leftovers anyway. When dining in they bring a spice mixture to the table with three levels of heat to customize your dish. Full bar and decent prices so I really can't find anything bad to mention. Hope you enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai restaurant in Ballantyne, Charlotte.  We stopped in after several friends suggested their Pad Thai.  Having moved here from Hawaii, getting good Pad Thai is a must.  And, Basil did not disappoint.   Fantastic and their jasmine rice was very well done.   We also order the Larb and it was fantastic.  Instead of Romaine, they served the minced beef with Cabbage.  That worked!  The cilantro and mint added to the beef was perfect.    We also had the red curry.  It was just barely spicy and was well balanced.  We had it with Chicken and it's the closest thing to our favorite place in Hawaii we have tasted since moving here. And, they use white chicken. Well done.    Love this place and Renee, our server was amazing. She knew the dishes well and told us all the Gluten free options.  Love that.   Kudos and look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Two words come to mind that best describe my experience: thoroughly disappointing. The ambience is great - the decor is good and the waitstaff were nice enough. If I could end the review there this would be a 5 star review... but oh, the food.   I ordered a staple, Pad Thai. I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth.   And the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it.   On our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something.   I really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back.   Oh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast."}
{"text":"This a fairly new place in the shopping center on Rea Rd so since I love Thai food thought id give it a try.   The place  I love the contemporary decor with really cool lighting and statues everywhere.  I am by no means an expert but I thought they did a great job on this place.  Also loved that it very clean.  The food  I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the shrimp and rice.  Both were well done and had a great flavor.  All the ingredients tasted fresh which to me always make the food so much better.  Also came out hot which is a big plus.    The staff  Our waitress was great she was very attentive not sure my water ever went below half full!!  She was very funny and talked to us a few minutes.  That alone would bring me back to this place  The verdict This place is a win on every front including price.  I cant wait to come back a try more items on the menu.  The place alone is worth going to just to see the cool decor kudos to the owner!"}
{"text":"This was my fifth  time at Basil Thai...I have been to the Uptown location three times  and the Stonecrest location, twice. I used to go to JoJo's Chinese which was housed in the same location. We had a party of 7 - and we ordered some appetizers to start...which was the Chicken and Beef Sate and the Egg rolls.  They were okay...just okay...Not anything to write home about...The condiment tray was nice...some great green Thai chili's in vinegar! We ordered Hot sake..but Alas..it was not hot..and it took forever to come to our table. ..It was weak and unremarkable. My entree was the Basil Barramundi, which was a great fish that was not the least bit fishy..tasted very fresh and filleted beautifully. The problem is they put the same scoop of Thai Vegetables on every Chef Specialty that comes out of the kitchen and it just wets down the entree. It did not need to have that ladled on . It was on my husbands Red Curry Duck and also my daughters Basil Thai Duck and my Barramundi . The atmosphere is nice...lots of tables but I truly think the food at the one Uptown is better and the Kitchen Manager needs to rethink a few things.....Thai - Out..."}
{"text":"Went there last night Service was great friendly attentive and a little fun. Made the food which was great even better. We (4 of us) got pad ti and the red curry duck. This really was the best duck I have eaten in a long time. There was    actually enough duck to eat for two. Taste fantastic. Highly recommend this."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the ambience was very calm, quiet and relaxing. The fried rice varieties were the best ever I had in charlotte."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the warm, modern decor welcomes you. The owner did an excellent job with creating an sleek, comfortable ambiance. I went on a Thursday evening & the food was the best Thai I've ever eaten.... especially the Pad Thai - the noodles weren't sticky! Everything was fresh, simple and not over seasoned. Service was spot-on. A definate go-to!"}
{"text":"If you are familiar with the original BASIL in charleston South Carolina you will absolutely love this Basil as they are one in the same! I get my usual pad Thai because its amazing and never fails. The drinks are good especially the pineapple Martini! Service was good and we'll definitely be returning soon, can't beat this location!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place but was pretty disappointed in the end. Food was pricey for what we actually got. With two little kids, there is nothing on the menu for them so this is NOT a good family place. We asked for a side of vegetables and were told we had to order an actual vegetable meal! Are you kidding me? My kids ate nothing but rice. We tried another time and my husband and I were again disappointed with how much we spent and how underwhelming the food was. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Deliberately OverBilled- Had to call Credit Card Company to void the transaction.   I had the Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai for Lunch. Small portions... and overpriced at $14.22. Now i know why that place is always empty on any given day....(Ballantyne Location). The servers are rude, and the manager Jennifer is extremely uneducated and unprofessional. Will Never Go there again including the uptown location."}
{"text":"Came the first month they opened. Service was horrible. Very nice atmosphere. Pad kee Mao was ok, not very spicy like I asked for. Husband got curry and his wasn't spicy either. Server never filled our drinks. Took forever to order. Took forever to bring check. Might try again but overpriced compared to other Thai restaurants around."}
{"text":"Over priced was going to order lad nah to go didn't even have that. I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here the other night.  I had the crispy red curry duck, supposed to be a specialty ($25).  What a disappointment!  It should be renamed, soggy skin overcooked duck with no flavor.  My wife had pad Thai.  Sorry to say it wasn't much better.  We have eaten at the Basil Thai uptown and it is very good.  This meal was not worth anywhere close to $60!  We won't be back to this location.  If you want great Thai food close by go to Bahn Thai instead.  Better food and less expensive!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here a few weeks ago. It has some of the tastiest pad Thai. I am from the west coast and have eaten really good pad Thai but until this restaurant I have not had yummy results locally. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 stars is because the portion size is small. It had great protein in it but overall was a very small dish. If they add some more noodles that would help portion size. Meat wise it was a nice portion."}
{"text":"I Really enjoy eating here the flavor is awesome I Haven't had anything that I didn't like so far.  The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable .  Great atmosphere for dates as well as family .  Very good wine selection as well as cocktails."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night, thinking it was going to busy but it wasn't we got in within 20 mins of arriving. The ambience of the restaurant was excellent and the decor was good, as well as the wait staff being very helpful and attentive. However though the food wasn't awful it wasn't authentic I thought. I eat Thai food all the time and I was expecting a more authentic taste. I got the basil chicken and it just didn't taste authentic, the food was still good however."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food is great. Service is excellent and the patio is very nice perfect for a summer evening dinner ."}
{"text":"We arrived in time for our reservation, but they did not have a table ready. Our very large bowl of soup to share (as indicated on the menu) was brought out at the same time as our entrées, which made for a very crowded table for two. These things being said, the food was incredible. We shared the Sour Seafood Soup, which was REALLY damn good. My wife had the Pad Thai and I had the Green Curry Beef and both were about as good as we have had. The minor service mishaps would not deter us from returning, but is the only reason they don't get 4.5/5 stars at the $$ price range."}
{"text":"Tom Yum Soup here-need I say more! Packed with lots of Seafood and generous portion, says two but we had multiple bowls. I went with the shrimp pad Thai-delicious. The decor is casual but with a modern simplicity.  Bar in front with lots of good looking young people and you can eat there too."}
{"text":"Did a pick up of Masaman curry and it was plate-licking good. I got their veggie fried rice with basil and that was tasty as well. Online menu is confusing - there is a difference of 3 to 5 bucks between lunch and dinner prices, which threw me off when I saw the bill. Overall, pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the uptown Basil location and was excited to see this location open up closer to home. Overall the meal was a huge disappointment and I don't plan on returning.   We ordered pad thai, tom yum soup, sweet and sour tofu, basil rolls, egg rolls and lettuce chicken wraps. The chicken in the lettuce wraps had actually gone bad - the smell was noticeably off and we had to send it back. Basil rolls were good but small for the price - just two pieces with hardly any shrimp. Same with the egg roll - we couldn't even taste egg. The sweet and sour tofu was the nights major miss - it had absolutely zero flavor. The sweet and sour sauce added nothing to the dish and we had to heap on our own spices from the spice tray. Pad thai also had almost no flavor as well.   Service was brusque and spotty. The prices do not match the food and service and ambiance was considerably less warm than the uptown location. Will get my thai fix at thai first instead."}
{"text":"Basil is a great spot for your go-to Thai that's yummy, warm, and has amazing ginger mints you should snag on your way out.  Seriously on the ginger mints - they're sort of life changing.  I've been to the Ballantyne and Uptown locations - both have a cozy atmosphere that's casual and conducive to sharing a meal with peeps you like.  I ordered the veggie delight with shrimp - it was mild and in a light brown sauce that was really flavorful.  Sometimes the veggie dishes at restaurants can be bland - this was not.  The veggies were fresh and there was a good variety of mushrooms, peas, broccoli and shrimp.  My mom ordered the papaya salad - which was spicy and delicious.  This is one of her favorite places to order the papaya salad (and she's tried a lot of them).  My dad ordered the red curry with chicken - and it had a nice, soothing heat that gets your blood pumping without sacrificing flavor.  Highly recommend Basil for a tasty time - but be sure to call and make a reservation if you can - they're busy during dinner time!"}
{"text":"So sad to have to say this, but Basil left my wife and I very disappointed.  The lunch service was terrible.  I arrived early and ordered for both of us.  It took forever for the waitress to even come to the table.  When my wife arrived, the waitress did not even acknowledge her.  At the very least, I would have thought she would offer to get her something other than water to drink.  We ordered a shrimp and a steak salad.  We watched 2 tables who were seated and ordered after us get their apps, and main course well before us.  We stopped a food runner to check on our order, which was brought out right after we asked about it.  After the food was brought, the waitress never checked on us.  We finished eating and had to flag her down to request the check.  They were not that busy.  The food was 50/50.  My wife's shrimp salad was again perfectly cooked.  My steak salad however was over cooked and had no flavor.  So so sad."}
{"text":"We were excited to see a new Thai restaurant come to the neighborhood especially since we were not a fan of JoJo. Well maybe it's the location but the food was plain vanilla yet the prices were gold plated!  We ordered takeout which included some basics to see if we should go further next time. Eggs rolls, pad Thai and steamed veggies dishes. Portions were small. Flavoring was minimal. Lack of much chicken or shrimp or peanuts in Pad Thai.    The bill though was way over the top. At least 2x what it should have been. It will be interesting to see if this place lasts long."}
{"text":"Amazing satay. Wonderful, attentive wait staff. Great with food allergies."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, but I thought the food was delicious.   I ordered the Peed-Seu, with chicken, eggs, and flat noodles. Of course, I had to order the local beer, Birdsong Pale Ale.  My friends order the Peed-Seu and Pad-Thai. They enjoyed their meals as well   Service was great!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are huge fans of the Basil Uptown so we just had to try the Btyne location.  It is located right in the Stonecrest Shopping Center and right next to Marble Slab and Smashburger (where the old China Bistro used to be).    I'm going to write this review a little differently than I usually do because of the circumstances.  This Basil had things that I LOVED and things that I hated.  And obviously the LOVED items were just that good that it drove my 4 star rating.  But here is the list of \"must get\" and the \"pass\":  Must get:   Fried Wontons:  Crispy, flavorful, with a creamy finish.  Sweet sauce was excellent! Pad Thai:  If you are a Thai place and screw this up.... Pack your things...  You're done.   This was delicious and just the right texture and flavor! Crispy Duck w/ Red Curry Sauce:   Chef Specialty and it was PHENOMINAL!!  Crispy succulent duck with a perfect curry sauce to give it a little heat.  I would absolutely recommend that you order this.   Hendricks Martini:  Mixed with some saki and cucumber.  Refreshing!  Pass: Basil Garlic (Beef):  Very boring and plain.  It just tasted like a ton of garlic with some bland beef sprinkled in Dark and Stormy:  Bland rum cocktail   Enjoy!    Ian M."}
{"text":"I came to Basil Thai with my cousin and sister and we left very happy! First, their contemporary interior decor was very elaborate with elephants and statues. The space was spacious, open, and refreshing. Our waiter was very prompt with our drinks (Thai tea, they were fantastic!!!), appetizer (fresh shrimp basil rolls, neatly wrapped and served with their delicious sauce), and food. We ordered Pad Thai, Basil Duck, and Basil. They were all SOOO good. We completely finished the Pad Thai (a bit smaller portion than others but DELICIOUS) and took the leftovers home. It wasn't too crowded and the noise-level was perfect. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Had to ask for a waiter after 15 minutes of waiting. Had to ask for utensils. Had to remind waiter of drink request. Had to go inside and ask another waiter to find our waiter and get the check. The place was desolate, FYI. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Average Thai food for above average prices. Granted, the ambience is better than your neighborhood Thai restaurant but I can't trade flavor for ambience. The service is earnest but save your pennies and head to Bahn Thai instead for the real deal."}
{"text":"I found myself at Basil after a haircut and decided to get some takeout and wait for it at the bar. The restaurant is really beautiful and has a classy atmosphere.   Our go-to thai dishes are larb, Pad Thai, and panang chicken. Panang curry was not on their menu so I ordered larb, Pad Thai and a shrimp and vegetable dish. I noticed it was pretty expensive, so was expecting it to be really good. I drank two drafts while I waited and the staff was really nice. The manager stopped by and spoke to me, he was very personable. The bill came to $64.   When I got home, my husband and I opened it up and found a very skimpy portion of larb. It was tasty, just not very much. The pad thai was fine, not great. Clumps of noodles not mixed in, chicken was dry. The shrimp dish was a container of steamed broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage with 5 grilled butterfly shrimp. The sauce was on the side. No rice. Overcooked shrimp, undercooked broccoli, wet cabbage, sauce was ok. This was a $25 dish and I was not impressed. We usually have at least enough leftovers for one person to have lunch the next day, but that was not the case this time because there just wasn't that much food.  Since I can get delicious succulent Thai food from other places for half the price, I won't be returning to Basil."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying the food here is fantastic. They have a very specific flavor profile and I have really enjoyed every meal I've gotten hear. Especially the Thai duck. Amazing.  The service is where things start to get iffy. I've been here 3 different times over a pretty spread out period and it's the same story everytime we go. They are SLOW. the last time I went we almost left because it took 30 minutes, 30 minutes for someone to come take our drink order. And if you need a refill your out of luck. Also when the meal is done be prepared to wait for anyone to bring a check. We also never have a specific waiter when we go here. Maybe that's the problem. I think the manager took our drink order, they have a water person. Different people at our table everytime.  The problem is not being understaffed either. They seem to have a lot of servers standing around but not really doing anything. 4 or 5 hotestess.   Hopefully they can get this fixed and the service lives up to the food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Basil Thai and it was great. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed it's not really a Thai feel more like a modern feel. We got one of their soups for an appetizer they said it would serve two and it did. I don't remember what it was called but it was very good. Then I got a Massaman curry and it wasn't very thick and it had very strong flavors (in a good way) then my sister got a Pud Woo Sen and it was also very good and had a lot of good flavors. The service is also pretty good, we weren't ever just waiting to get someone to help us. If you're in the area it's definitely worth a try, however I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, it is good but not good enough for me to pass three other Thai restaurants on the way there."}
{"text":"Best in Charlotte Pad Thai with a world-class tasting Green Curry for two. Our server was very professional and knowledgeable in answering the many questions we had."}
{"text":"Interior is good. Atmosphere inside feels great. We ordered chicken shrimp dumpling (wonton) soup.. at first I was little reluctant towards it. This soup looked like a dumping inside water, but it  tasted real good.  Been habitual of having food of various hues I found little hesitant to accept that this watery soup can test good.  We scape appetizer and ordered entrées. Basil with tofu and pad prik with chicken. My dish was basil, the little gravy it has was sweetened which I found hard to finish with uncooked brown rice. Second dish was too sweet-pad prik..the biggest setback was both the dishes were not warm at all..too cold that it was hard for us to finish with uncooked rice.  Somehow we finished tofu and chicken.. but overalls it was meh.. I wanted my first visit here to be special one but I think I need to wait until for some good stuff yet!!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, pleasant wait staff - even on a busy Valentine's Day evening when they were hopping.  My husband and I shared the tom kha gai soup and had plenty left over to bring home.  He had the pad woo sen, which he loved and has now enjoyed this entree at Basil three times now.  I had the masaman curry chicken, which had just the right amount of spice, though just a bit more cashews would have made it perfect!   A great variety of desserts to offer, but we went with the chocolate mousse cake (because it's Valentine's Day - and who doesn't need chocolate on this day?).  The cake was so decadent, we ate every crumb.   Have also been for lunch, which was much more low key and quiet.  Prices are lower at lunch, but good food and menu either time of day."}
{"text":"Overall disappointing. It was just okay and definitely have had better here in Charlotte and at more affordable pricing.       We ordered the Thai chicken wings which were my favorite thing we ordered. They were flavored well, crispy and had a good dipping sauce. I'm a sucker for anything with lime juice and fish sauce. Also ordered the sum tom. Just okay, really not that flavorful. Pad-see-u definitely should have had more broccoli in it. Just a few little nuggets among a valley of noodles for $15.95 made me regretful for even wanting to come. Truth be told, I only picked Thai because I really was hoping to get some Thai boat noodle soup and they didn't even have it.  Our server was nice and did a wonderful job with making sure that everything was good.  If you ask for a chili tray, don't expect what you would typically get from a Thai place but instead 3 little servings of Sriracha, sambal, and dried red pepper.  Our server didn't charge us for our drinks and maybe that is because she heard me complaining about the nasty ass orange juice she gave my son. Either way, that was kind of her."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star specifically for customer service. The manager Dan Cole was a complete jerk! My friend ordered the shrimp fried rice and simply did not like the way it tasted. She didn't eat it, he attempted to force it on her. Then left it on the bill and told us that \"this wasn't a buffet\"."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. The manager was helping the host sit tables when we first walked in and when a table opened up she almost skipped me and my girlfriend and was going to give our table to someone else when we had waited WAY longer than the other couple. And no, the other couple did not have a reservation either. They ask when you first walk in. Then she realizes that she is skipping us because my friend speaks up and proceeds to sit us down instead. The server was nice at first however after our food was delivered she only checked on us ONCE. We waited about 15 minutes after we finished our food until I had to get up TWICE to get my check. First I told the host that we needed our checks. We just wanted to pay for our food and leave. 5 minutes later, NOTHING. Then I see the manager walk by I tell her what is going on. Another 5 minutes later, she FINALLY brings us our checks not even offering a courtesy dessert or discount for our terrible experience. She just drops the check on the table and walks away. Is that appropriate manager behavior? At least an apology. The only reason I tried the one here in Charlotte is because I had Basil first in Charleston and fell in love. The one here in Charlotte though, SUCKS. The food is also not as tasty as the other location in SC. So disappointing."}
