{"text":"I would have to say this is one of my favorite hotel restaurants, located in the Sheraton Cavalier.  Our group enjoyed lunch as pictured and all appreciated their respective dishes: chicken tenders, fish tacos, Thai chicken noodle curry, steak sandwich & buffet. I had the curry & it was delicious! It was better than expected with tender chicken breast, rice noodles & red pepper. The lime was dry, but it wasn't needed.   They are also @MealshareTeam participants for some social good.   We were attending a conference in the hotel & so the location was ideal. It's actually pretty convenient if anyone in the area (NE Calgary) wants to swing by. There is plenty of parking, as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat while staying at the Sheraton Cavalier hotel.  The breakfast and lunch buffets are relatively cheap considering the quality of the food and service.  I wish we ate here more often, but we only tried the breakfast buffet on a Saturday morning, which included a free toy for kids if they came in their pajamas.  The toys were in bins near the front of the restaurant, and children can choose their own toy after they finish eating."}
{"text":"Hotels used to have lavish lunch buffets with some sort of meat.  Nowadays $12 will get you an all you can eat soup and salad bar.  Luckily Colors Bistro still offers one other hot item (usually a pasta).  I miss the old days when this bistro would make endless refills of custom pasta dishes PLUS the salad bar, which we all know is really a concession prize for the good stuff.  The food is good, quality is OK and service is excellent here.  I'd probably try the menu items which might be a better value than the salad bar."}
{"text":"Customer service, value, quality of food, convenience, d√©cor ... all in a lunch buffet.   I was greeted kindly by the hostess and a server, ate at a beautiful table and my experience from start to finish was five stars. I began by sampling the salad bar, which had sliced hard boiled eggs, three types of salad greens, pickled pearl onions, a wide variety of cheese, fresh vegetables and also a very tasty pasta salad and red potato salad that wasn't mushy mashed potatoes, but well made with a great taste.   For the main course, there were two offerings: roast chicken legs and meat lasagna. I sampled a bit of each. I don't like chicken legs but found a small piece of white meat and it was really good. What surprised me was that I polished off everything I took. Sometimes in a buffet, I can't finish something because I either didn't like it or it was too much.   Dessert was the best part. My favourite was a coconut mousse over a chocolate cake crust with coconut sprinkled into chocolate sauce and a perfect fresh raspberry. I've ordered desserts at high end restaurants that didn't come together as well as this did, and it was part of a dessert buffet bar.   The manager walked by and politely asked how my lunch was. And this is why I give five, not four stars. She, like the other staff, genuinely seemed to care about the job they were doing. It was like a well oiled machine. What a hidden gem. Fast, delicious, great customer service and quality food. When I got my bill I was happy to pay! $10.95 for a delicious lunch buffet ... totally awesome."}
