{"text":"Amazing!  Great food and prices!  The staff is friendly and the pho is so fresh.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My staff recommended this place ... and being so close to work I figured why not give a try. I ordered 4 Fresh Rolls and it came to $7.90. At first I thought they made a mistake and only prepared 2 rolls ... but no ... $7.90 for 4 Fresh Rolls is pretty reasonable. So the taste ... it was good ... I would improve on the sauce though (but i make a killer sauce so I should not compare). The place itself is a bit dated  ... but you are there for the food so it did bit bother me.  Over all great place ... Bucky recommended."}
{"text":"Got mi bo kho.  It was not good. Tasted very watered down and plain. And very little meat. Ordered off skip the dishes."}
