{"text":"A very good first time experience at The Cutting Board. Considered going before but seemed they were a little slow getting off the ground. I will definitely go back. Aurora really needs more good dining options, so I wish them well. 

Went at lunch time and was impressed with the right mix of creativity in the menu options without being too far out of the mainstream. Really enjoyed the food. Ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich with Bourbon Slaw and side salad with the Honey Scallion dressing (a no charge substitute for fries). I truly enjoyed the meal. They make things from scratch here, not reheating frozen like so many of the chains do today. For that reason, I don't agree with others that say they are overpriced. I found pricing to be spot on for the value delivered. 

The waitress was also very friendly, informative and attentive which topped off the experience. 

They have Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner menus so need to go back and try the others. I don't write many reviews and rarely give 5 stars to anything, but if they go 2 for 2 with me, they have a shot. Definitely a place worth trying in the Aurora area."}
{"text":"I hate to admit this but I've lived in Bainbridge for over 20 years and have never walked into the doors of The Aurora Inn.  Now that I've eaten there 3 times in the last 2 weeks, I can now say I'm a bit embarrassed. Our dinner engagements have allowed us to taste the strip steak, in-bone pork chops, burgers, salads and desserts. ALL of these offerings have been outstanding. I would even go as far as to say the burgers just may be the best in metro Cleveland --- yes, and that means the B-Spot, FlipSide and my bargain favorite Five Guys are also-rans.

The key is fresh ingredients, and excellent preparation. On top of all this, the prices are quite reasonable. A nice find, practically in my back yard."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Sunday, early afternoon and the place was almost empty. It took 5 minutes or longer for someone to greet us and get our drinks. It took even longer to get or food ordered and even longer to get or check! I have no idea why the service was so poor because there was hardly anyone there. The waitress wasn't very friendly either which only added to our frustration. We each had a salad and we both agreed it was good, but the time and frustration is not worth it. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family has driven past the Aurora Inn for years so when they opened a restaurant we were curious. Let's just say curiosity could kill the cat...that is, if the undercooked chicken my dad ate had salmonella...and if he was a cat. My mom had the perogies and she compared her love for them to her love for my dad- he's imperfect, but she loves him anyway. Meow! I had the burger and fries and they were fine. I wasn't in love, the burger was tasty (esp. the pickles!), but the fries tasted like they went from the freezer to the fryer. 

My dad did mention to the staff the undercooked chicken and the manager was gracious enough to give him half-off. That was redeeming. 

So we're giving it three stars because mine and my mom's food was good (albeit overpriced), but not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The food is not cooked properly and the staff is worried more about texting then their customers."}
{"text":"Love the new restaurant at the Aurora Inn, a very interesting mesh of the nostalgic values the Inn has always had with a modern twist. The food is comfort food at its best, and the atmosphere turns very cozy in the evening. Plus breakfast everyday? Yes please."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food with outstanding local ingredients!!!
Chef knows his stuff, we'll be back for date nite on Saturday!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Waitress was very sweet but kitchen was not prepared, long wait for food and they ran out of food. Waitress was unaware they ran out until all but one in our party was served. They  served food that should not have been served- over cooked, burnt on the bottom! And The place  wasn't even busy! We were their only party! My advice- GO ELSEWHERE!"}
{"text":"One of our all-time worst experiences. The food is absolutely horrible. I ordered chicken and waffles for $14 and it was a waffle with dried out flattened over cooked burnt chicken on top. The coffee was supposed to be French press, although it was served out of a lukewarm carafe. I don't understand the reviews that are good on this particular restaurant. I would give it zero stars if I could. My husband ordered eggs with ham and toast. How do you get that wrong? His ham was literally lunch meat. His toast was burnt. All in all this was just a very horrible experience. I could not believe what this awful restaurant charged us."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food was cold and two waitresses couldn't manage to split the bill correctly and it will take a week for it to come back on my card. Visited the cutting board when it first opened and would have thought they would have ironed these things out. Safe to say they haven't."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great hidden gem right here in Aurora.  We live right around the corner, but never had the chance to stop by.  Why?  I do not have an answer for that.  First things first, when you get there, ask for Janet.  What an amazing and accommodating waitress.  I ordered the strip steak, which came out a little over cooked.  Janet took it back several times until it came out just right.  The Chef was very apologetic and in the end, the steak was amazing.  My wife had the Salmon, which was off the hook.  We will definitely be going back fir multiple vista, as this is now on our regular list of \"must go there often\" restaurants.   

Came back for second visit and was not disappointed.  Enjoyed a nice bottle of red for only $5 on a special Wine night.  We had an amazing bone-in pork chop and Asiago chicken.  Both had flavor that were off the hook.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant, but we have now tried three times and each time more disappointing than the previous. Each time they only had one person serving both indoor and outdoor, which obviously meant very poor service. What was most alarming is the last attempt the server was incredibly rude.  We have been fairly pleased with the food but if you are looking for attentive or timely service I would highly advise against this place."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went here for Sunday brunch. We loved the ambiance and the food was amazing but the service was so slow. We are pretty reasonable people so if they had been busy we really wouldn't have minded too much. Considering that there were only 3 tables seated there was no excuse for this meal to last more than 90 minutes. It's also not like this was a new or apologetic server either. She honestly didn't seem to give a crap and I had to stand up and flag her down to get a check.

It's such a shame that the service is so frustrating because we would eat here all the time if the service was better. We ordered the Chicken & Waffles and the Crab Cake Benedict. Both were amazing. The only reason for the extra stars is because something great is happening in the kitchen. It's too bad that a crappy sever can ruin the whole experience."}
{"text":"WORST dining experience my friends (8) and I have ever had. Service rates a negative 5 stars; food was mediocre at best. We were in town for a wedding and had a confirmed 7:30 reservation for 8 on June 15; arrived on time, place was nearly empty and we were told by the less than cordial hostess to \"take that table.\" It took 20 minutes for a wait person to come and take a drink order (after three different members of our party asked if some one was going to come to our table) and another 20 for the drinks to arrive (but only some of them). We were also told that we could review a wine list but most of what was on it was not going to be available as they were redoing the list. Food, when it did arrive, was so-so and there were only five place settings at the table We had to ask for more. To top it off, there was a 20% gratuity added to the bill but not noted on the bill; we only discovered this after one member of the party asked why there was a discrepancy between the total bill and the four individual bills we ultimately requested. A disaster and joke from start to finish. If this was an example of \"Ohio Proud\" the bar has been set very low. I've had a better experience grabbing a hot dog at a convenience store."}
{"text":"NOTE! The menu listed here on Yelp is not their current menu. They let us know they frequently change it when we went there hoping to order a few things that they did not have listed. There were still plenty of good options! But don't show up with a plan like we do ;)

We went for lunch on a Friday. We started with French Onion soup (as none of the appetizers we wanted to try were listed), and it came out COLD! We hateee sending stuff back, but it was unbearable! It came back warm, and it was pretty good.

I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich. Good, but not at all what I pictured/craved. I was wanting a big CRISPY fried chicken breast with some hot sauce on top, but it was actually coated around the whole chicken which made it soggy. I'm also not sure what made the slaw \"bourbon\" slaw. I did really like the fries that came with it. My boyfriend got a Bison Burger (the special of the day) with a side of the garlic aioli and side salad. These were the best things we ordered! We loved the garlic aioli, and the honey scallion dressing. The burger was just pretty good.

We are moving, and wanted to try this place before we leave so we won't be back regardless. But we told our friends, \"eh\"."}
{"text":"Love his cute atmosphere for brunch on a Sunday. Not busy, very quiet and fresh food. Decor is adorable and staff is so friendly. Everything we have all had had been great! Great man have to try it outside of brunch, but the grilled cheese and burger on the brunch menu are good! Don't avoid this place because it's in the hotel, it feels very separate!"}
{"text":"Alright, there's a lot of mixed reviews. I noticed the really negative ones were mostly from lunch and dinner experiences, and also at a time when the restaurant was new.

So, this review is specifically for breakfast, time: 9:15am on a Saturday.

What to expect: conventional American breakfast fare, nothing eclectic or experimental, a quaint ambience, and a price of around $15 per person with tip.

The service was fast, attentive, courteous, with a total stay of 45 minutes. But, there were only 3 tables occupied.

Recommendation: The Belgian Waffle. It's a great place for weekend breakfast because this beats the crowd at First Watch or Pancake House, but for the same food at a similar price."}
{"text":"Our first trip to the new restaurant in Aurora was a good one.  The food was prepared well and tasted very good.  The wine selection was also good (at least the glasses we ordered).  We did have to wait 45 minutes for our food, but that appeared to be just us based on how quickly other tables got their food.

We will definitely come back again, hoping they work out their kinks by then.  Good to have another option in Aurora!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a nice Sunday breakfast.  Sat in the bar area and my wife and I enjoyed a nice breakfast with a cozy fire.  This place rocks for comfort and great quality food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for Sunday brunch today, and it was great! The service was very quick and attentive. The decor is very cute and inviting. I got the Belgium waffle. It was perfectly cooked. It had a great texture and was served with real whipped cream & Ohio maple syrup. We will definitely be back. 

The restaurant is actually located in the Aurora Inn. Go in the yellow door and take a left."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found out about this restaurant from a dining book that we received as a gift. Our dinner was well worth the 45 minute drive to the restaurant. The food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Our portions were rather large for the price. I would recommend the pork chops and swordfish to anyone . There is also a great selection of drinks and delicious desserts. The Cutting Board is a gem, and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my parents who were from out of town. Everyone enjoyed it. We sat on the back patio because it was a beautiful day. This place seems to be a restaurant and inn. Everything is being remodeled or is new and clean. The patio is covered so you could sit there rain or shine. The woman who was tending bar was also working the patio and the service was great! 
Menu was full of different things and had something for everyone. Menu had soup, wings, tacos, salads, burgers, flatbreads, etc. We all had salads which were good size and fresh. Had one with Amish chicken and it was great! Wonderful drink menu and nice little bar inside. 
Don't be afraid to go casual and it's priced right. Going to definitely be back for lunch and will eventually try it for dinner."}
{"text":"Family night out to try the all you can eat fish dinner and fish tacos. I am giving 2 stars for the food.  It was really good as were the cocktails, even though they were overpriced at $10.  The service needs some serious help.  We waited 25 minutes to be seated and the restaurant wasn't full.  They are understaffed and it is noticeable.  The second order of my fish took 20 minutes to arrive.  We won't be going back until they get more servers because fish tacos and fish dinner shouldn't take 2 hours."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more! 2 stars because the patio area is nice and pleasant to sit at. That's about all I can comment positively on. 

We were seated then presented with wrinkled and food-stained menus. Our waitress seemed to be having a rough day -- she wasn't very pleasant or friendly at first, but fortunately that improved a bit after our drinks arrived. 

We ordered the wings for an appetizer. When they came the consistency was off-- they had been pre-cooked and reheated. They lacked sauce and the two we tried were cold in the middle. The accompanying celery was curling and brown. We sent it back and since it had taken awhile to get to us, we asked not to have a replacement, assuming our main dishes would be out soon. 

It took quite awhile for us to finally receive our meals! In that time our wine and water glasses sat empty on the side of the table waiting to be refilled. Finally dinner arrived, over cooked (steak culottes) and cold (the ratatouille on top of the grilled swordfish.) The starch sides were both gluey (risotto and blue potato mash) and the vegetables were crunchy (grilled asparagus) and woody (broccolini.) We ate it anyway because it took so long to arrive at the table that we were now running late for our show. 

Once we were done with the meal, finally our refills on water and wine arrived! We had to finish those without a meal. Sadly this place was a disappointment. The atmosphere is great but there needs to be improvement on the meals and service!"}
{"text":"A group of us met for dinner here last night- let me preface by saying we were the only people in the restaurant. My mom ordered a medium well burger- it was rare- she didn't even eat it and showed the waitress- my aunt ordered a lobster Mac and cheese- it was cold. My daughter ordered a grilled cheese and fries that were also cold but she was so hungry she scarfed it down anyways- We told the waitress and she said oh I'm sorry that never happens. Kind of disappointed that nothing else was done about it. First time eating there and unfortunately probably won't go back! I can't even imagine the food on a busy night! Cute atmosphere though"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start ... Let me start by saying that we haven't gotten our gang together in awhile so there was a lot of catching up chit chatting and some drinks but from our reservation at 6:45 we there longer than we thought based on the rest. Our party was for 11, seated right away, but service was incredibly slow, food was served wrong, and over cooked (mine was not the only one). One might ask why didn't you send it back, the other thought that crossed our mind was how long will it take to get it corrected.

Then at the end of the night probably took a good 20 minutes to get the bill, one couple's was messed up three times and the waitress started to argumentative and finally told them not to worry about it. That was not the point they were trying to make, they both work for restaurant so they clearly know how the service industry works. 

In addition, the manager keeping eyeing the table and walking past our table but never once stopped! Spending as much as we did and walked away \"hungry\" is very disappointing! I am always looking forward to a new restaurant, well this was not one to be returned to."}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere is super cool. Something out of a episode of Fixer Upper on HGTV. And the food was really good!But, walked in and was never really greeted and had to ask around at where to sit. Waitress was really nice but didn't have the best memory. Ordered a mojito and a beer. Then found out they were out of mint leaves and the kegs weren't working. So ordered new drinks, but I never even got my beer. She forgot, and by the time she came around again I didn't want one. The extras on my burger I ordered weren't there either. And was charged $2-$3 more for each  item on my bill than was listed on the menu. The manager did take care of it. 

I'd definitely go back. It just opened, they need a little bit of time and it will be great."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on open table for 6pm on Friday night for my husband, 3 year old child, and I.  Unfortunately, when we arrived, the restaurant had posted a sign that they were closed for dinner due to a fundraiser event that evening.  They had neglected to make the appropriate adjustments on the open table system.  Therefore, the system accepted our reservation. 

It took us another 40 minutes to find a plan B, drive there, and get seated on a Friday night.  This would have been our families first visit to this restaurant, and we don't plan to give it a second try.  

If you do book on open table, I would recommend calling to confirm your reservation."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a weekday and I have no complaints. Beautiful deck, laid back environment, and everything I ordered was delicious with nice presentation. Server was prompt, friendly, and advised me well on choosing between menu items. I had the charcuterie board, the caprese salad, and a Moscow mule. All excellent! Would love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Didn't even get our food. We were seated promptly. They told us there was a wedding and they were busy, but we assumed they planned well. I assumed the wedding was in their planning for serving the rest of the restaurant. I was wrong. Menus were thrown at us, dishes served like playing cards... A lot of noise.. Then there was none...after 15 mins we bailed. I think if they are accepting large parties they need to be planned not to interfere with regular diners."}
{"text":"Just finished a fantastic Fathers Day dinner at The Cutting Board, the new restaurant at The Aurora Inn. Service was great and so was the food. I ordered the Lobster Tail special and it was not only cooked perfectly, it had wonderful flavor. The sautéed vegetables were perfectly cooked as well. I will definitely be back.  

By the way, the decor was a bit different and much more pleasant than the reviewer from Arizona experienced. The room had quilts on the walls that she described as bare and large baskets of green herbs throughout. It not only felt warm and inviting, but fit well with the restaurant's Fresh to your Table motto."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was all of average...I sat at the bar so that I could hear the live music. Ordered the strip steak and mashed potatoes. Looked great, but, lacked any seasoning. Very disappointing.  The potatoes were totally dull and the steak was tough...I can cook much better..."}
{"text":"Nobody's perfect.  We know this.  People aren't perfect.  Their creations are reflections of that.  A 5 star rating is as close to perfect as you can get on Yelp.  4 stars is still pretty dang good, since you can't please everybody all the time.  And 3 stars? Well 3 stars was made, it seems, for The Cutting Board.

We made a Friday reservation on OpenTable, but we knew it wasn't necessary.  There wasn't a hostess stand and we entered the restaurant.  We were sat immediately and our waitress wasn't far behind.  She was nice and attentive, for the most part.  No drink menus, but they did had Citramax IPA on tap in the bar next room over.  Wine and beer prices were good.  As mentioned in other posts, their menu changes often and they try to keep it updated online.   Even still, we tried to order scallops and they were unavailable.  Ok, next option.  Smoked chicken confit Mac and cheese.  It first came out and was lukewarm at best, so we flagged a server and got it replaced (or reheated).  It was delicious and almost seemed like pulled smoked pork.  My walleye dinner was good, like 3 stars good.  It was a good section of fish, apparently pan fried but still tasting of the breadcrumbs.  The vegetables were unevenly cooked, and the sweet potatoes were as well.

The bar next door was relatively lively, most likely because of the holidays and guests at the hotel.  They had a guitar player / singer who was his own one man band."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! We went to breakfast and waited 50 minutes to get an English muffin sandwich. Literally the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever had. 10 people walked out in front of us and I now I know why. It is a shame because we went here a few months ago and it was awesome."}
