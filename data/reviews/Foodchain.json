{"text":"Pour une \"salade\" sans laitue, seulement des légumes vrais. J'ai essayé la \"endive et poires vertes \", très rafraîchissante. J'aimerais avoir la possibilité d'ajouter une protéine en extra. Le pain magique est un délicieux amalgame de croissant, pain, tomates et fromage. Et que dire du pain bananes et chocolat!! Service extra rapide, tout est au quart de tour."}
{"text":"This place has some seriously awesome salads. Produce is super fresh. Some reviewers say they found the dressing salty, but the pickle salad I had tasted great. Dressings are all served on the side, so you can regulate.   I'll def go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place located downtown. I found that the salad portion was pretty big for the price (around 10$ each). I had the Cucumber Pickle salad which exceeded my expectations. The ingredients were fresh and the dressing was delicious.   Perfect for a quick lunch or takeout."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My salad was so fresh and ready before I even finished filling my water. I really enjoyed my meal, a fresh raw salad of thin sliced cauliflower, mushrooms, onion and parsley mixed with feta and topped with a seed blend and a citrus dressing. It was very filling and I can't emphasize how fast this food is prepared. Our group of nearly 40 people was served in less than 20 minutes! I will definitely be back next week."}
{"text":"Good value when you consider the other options available in the area. Definitely healthier and fresher than any other salad bars. Quick service, clean spot and good wifi -- what else?"}
{"text":"I'm usually not the vegan/vegetarian type but lately I've been trying a few spots out of curiosity, so when I heard about this new fast food concept I had to try it.  It opened just a few days ago so of course there are still a few adjustments that need to be made but in terms of design the place is gorgeous, the location is great next to the McGill metro station, PVM, Eaton Centre just to name a few.   The service was nice, our order arrived very fast and the staff took their time to explain the concept to us: they cut all the fresh vegetables and fruits on site, all menus are veggies or fruits only and they get protein from the variety of nuts they add to each menu.   I ordered the mushroom and cauliflower salad which was sooooo fresh, perfect for hot weathers like today, the crunch of the cauliflower and various little nuts matched very well with the softness of the mushrooms (I have to admit that I looooove fresh mushrooms) I also had their apple juice which actually tasted like apple (apple cider to be more precise).  Overall the meat lover that I am really enjoyed my experience,and I will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Since this year I am being a vegetarian; this restaurant has been on my radar for long time.   It's a cute, modern and adorable fast food but healthy spot.  The service is super quick since it's a fast food. I was honestly surprised how quick it was compared to McDonald's... . My server was an eye candy... but he was super nice and friendly, and he did a great job in serving.  I decided on Fennel Daikon, since it has two of my favorite ingredients Coriander and Cashew , with fennel, lime and wakame sauce. It was super delicious and filling.    If hungry for something light; this is the perfect spot in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"The food here is wayyyyyyy too advanced for my taste buds. Ordered the banana muffin, the magic bread, #5 endive green pear salad, and the two different kinds of juices (cranberry, apple).   First off, the juice is sparkling juice! Which I didn't realize until I had a sip. Not a fan of sparkling juices.  The salad is just on another level of taste levels. It's so nuanced and healthy tasting. I've never had anything like it yet I also have no desire to taste it again.   I can't say it was bad though! It's just too out there for me. I did really enjoy my banana muffin though (from hof kelsten).   The decor of the restaurant is really cool though. Very instagrammable."}
{"text":"One of the best salads I've ever had. Came here a couple times when I was in town for the weekend. Loved the juxtaposition of unedited rap music playing in the salad restaurant. Will definitely go back for a healthy quick bite."}
{"text":"Concept hyper intéressant. Un fast-food végétarien, quasiment végétalien au centre-ville. Très beau décor moderne- on ne se croirait pas dans un fast food. Menu court: 8 choix de salades fraîches, un pain magique (provenant de Hof Kelsten, alors vraiment fromagé et magique) et des sodas aux fruits maison. Les légumes sont coupés à la machine devant nous dès que la commande est passée. C'est simple et savoureux. Étant une fan finie de Mandy's c'est dur pour moi d'affirmer avec conviction que je reviendrai souvent ici... Mais je recommande quand même leurs salades!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try out Foodchain as it a new concept. I went on a Friday evening and only two customers were in the restaurant, ordering is super quick and they'll start making your order right away. I believe you can only pay by card, either debit or credit. You had the option of adding an Extra to your salad for 4$ either quinoa, tofu, legumes/beans or sunflower shoots. I skipped this option to try a salad as it is meant to be. The menu is only 8 salads and a few did not appeal to me right from the start. I went with cucumber and pickle, not your regular salad that's for sure.  This is a salad without lettuce, the veggies are cut on the bias which gives you different sizes of vegetables. It made it easy to pick out the red onion on my part. The mint in this salad really gave it a fresh taste, it was really tasty. The turnip adds a nice fresh crunch to this. I enjoyed the mustard dressing that had a real \"clear up your sinuses\" kick to it. The seeds packet included adds a nice crunch to your meal. At first I thought the salad was small, it filled only about half the bowl but once I finished it, I can say it was a good portion.   The only sad part was the pain magique, although it wasn't bad, it surely wasn't magic. I will try it again but mine seemed  undercooked, the texture felt too chewy. I am a true Mandy's fan and I feel like you can't compare these two restaurants because Foodchain has no lettuce in their salads. I truly enjoyed my meal and look forward to going back and try a new salad combination."}
{"text":"Des bonnes salades aux légumes bien frais! Tout est préparé sous tes yeux, très rapidement. Le vrai plus pour moi est l'utilisation de contenants écolo. À voir s'ils acceptent qu'on amène nos propres contenants, ce serait encore mieux! Est-ce que tous leurs produits sont bio et/ou locaux? J'espère qu'on en saura plus bientôt..."}
{"text":"Food of the future (hopefully). I really felt as if I was on Mars when eating here. The food was cut so strangely (yet amazingly fresh) by robots and the flavors were so unique!  I opted for the #1 (yellow beet and green apple). The apples and beets were sliced so thinly it had a refreshing crisp to it. It was covered in dill and accompanied by some ground nuts and a mustard sauce. As another reviewer said this dish (#1) was a little too tart (my word for it is zingy). I did finish half of it for lunch and my husband finished it when I got home and he loved it!   I saw them bring in their ingredients as I was eating, it's all fresh and seems to be from a farmers market.  I wish they had some gluten free bread to serve with it and some regular juice for my kid (fresh squeezed). It would also be great to add some actual lettuce to balance/soften out the textures.   I do appreciate that several of their dishes are gluten free dairy free. Glad to see they compost now. Also, cheaper than Mandy's which is a plus!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. My friend and I were lookibg for something healthy, affordable and refreshing. I absolutely love this place. I got the Endive salad which was super fresh. I would definitely comeback but try something new each time!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of of Charles-Antoine Crête and Cheryl Johnson who run Montreal Plaza, I was intrigued to experience their fast food philosophy and see what they can possible do with veggies that would make eating salad instead of a burger for lunch interesting. As I approached the store located on McGill street in the hub of downtown, the line around noon was outside the door and I gasped! But alas, I decided to do the queue anyways. I swear within 5 minutes, I was already in the door and placing my order. Simple concept: choose the veggie combo you prefer out of 8 possible combinations, add protein if you like, pay and wait for your order number to be called. I had my salad in hand in less than one minute! Now that's fast!! The space was very limited inside; as it was a nice day, I grabbed a seat on a bench outside to dig in.   I opted for combo 2 which included cabbage, radish, and parsley; plopped my little helping of seeds on top, added the generous amount of kimchi dressing, shook the container and voila! The salad was amazing! The vegetables were fresh and crispy, the seeds were hearty and crunchy, and the spicy dressing made for a perfect combo. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavours and textures, and was amazed that veggies could taste this good. The helping is generous but as I had skipped breakfast, I devoured it! The salad cost me 12$ but I was full and compared to what I'd spend at another fast food joint, the price is just right and well worth it. On a side note, every item used to package and transport the salad, including the bowl and takeout bag, is actually biodegradable! Go green!   We can agree that the made to order fast food concept at this place is done to perfection: quick service, super delicious and fresh food, and a limited carbon footprint. Crête and Johnson have done it again, and I will surely return to try another one of their salads soon!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ma première expérience ici. Un bon choix de salades santé fraîches, prêtes en 2 minutes!  Que des légumes, pas de feuilles de salade ni laitue.   Une vingtaine de places assises.  Ils font aussi pour emporter.   Service au comptoir courtois et rapide!  Bien aimé la salade chou-fleur et champignons."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a few times but never really thought much of it.  Somehow, it just reminds me how close we are getting to the age of Terminator when robots will take over all our jobs.  Not only in the name of the place, Foodchain (are we on the top or the bottom?), but also in how our salads are prepped.    With all the great reviews on Yelp, I had to investigate.  Here's how it works.  They pre-portion everything so you cannot substitute anything.  Once you place your order, it all gets tossed into one of their giant commercial grade food processor that divides the cashier area and their open kitchen like metal offensive linemen or bouncers which then slices all the ingredients to perfection.  It's actually a very clever concept.  I can see this helping people eat veggies they might normally shy away from because they are cut so small and mixed in well with other ingredients.  Thank you, Yelpers.  So far, this is the best tasting salad in Montreal.  That's saying alot because I'm from California, home of the \"salad as a meal\" concept.  I ordered the Cabbage Radish (#2) and a gluten free brownie.  The salad was very tasty. It came with a kimchi dressing which was nice and spicy.  I like that the dressing is always \"on the side\" so you could use as much or as little as you want; and they are generous with the dressing portion.  Lots of plastic.  Although it's all compostable material, it still didn't feel right because I don't know enough about it.  I would have preferred a paper bowl for dine-in guests.  Hell, even for take-out, now that I think about it.  That's what many health nut places in LA do it.  No lettuce as fillers so all you get is the good stuff:  veggies, fruits, seeds, and nuts.  The brownie is gluten-free and is really good for being gluten-free.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  Gave me some suggestions and extremely knowledgeable about their menu and products.  They have 8 salads to choose from.  I'm definitely going to try and cross them all off the list."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place for its freshness and speedy service, but the salad was to acidic to my liking. While I began to eat, half way through the taste was saturated and bitter. This is definitely not the best salad I have ever consumed. For the time being, I have no interest in returning to that place. I ordered what appeared to be the most popular choice, beet and apple with a side of cranberry. Beverages are either apple or cranberry carbonated juice."}
{"text":"The Good: Beautiful restaurant with beautiful people. Good service, good ambiance and very fast.  The Bad: Salad portion was very small contrary to what was written in the Gazette. Salad was abnormally cold to the palate. Not of variety in the salads. Also, the pain magic was also abnormally cold.   Overall, the place and location was nice but the food was disappointed."}
{"text":"Concept de salades de légumes frais, fait sur place avec des robots coupes professionnels / service rapide pour emporter. Menu simple de différentes sortes de salades santé (ex: carotte/endive ou chou/radis). Prix abordables, ma salade betterave/pomme 9$ + jus 3$ + pain magique 4$. Produits frais de qualité. Super concept, facilement exportable, je suis sûr qu'il y aura d'autres ''foodchain'' bientôt à Montréal et au reste du Québec. Localisé sur l'Avenue McGill en bas de Sainte-Catherine, petit local exigu / déco moderne rétro / céramique+luminaires. Endroit, parfait pour les gens d'affaires / touristes ou tout montréalais au centre-ville pour emporter une salade fraîche au bureau ou manger sur un des nouveaux bancs de l'Avenue. Ma copine et moi avons adorés. Je serai de retour.   5/5 visité en mai 2017"}
{"text":"Such an excellent spot for salads! They're fresh, crunchy, full of flavours and textures, just yummy. The sizes are quite large too and the prices are fair (9-11$). My ultimate favorite so far is the cucumber pickle, with cheese, mustard and mint. It's the perfect balance of salty and sour. The chou-radis one has some pretty spicy kimchy coming with it, be careful with your dosing ;) Definitely a runner-up for Mandy's."}
