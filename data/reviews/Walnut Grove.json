{"text":"Good food, average service. Prices are high for the quality."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently moved from a smaller, strip-mall location in Fox Chapel, to a newly refurbished building, complete with patio in the Waterworks. While the new decor looks great, the food has stayed the same.  I find the menu as a whole to be underwhelming and dull in the first place (it is nearly identical to the menu at the Walnut Grill in Shadyside). Furthermore, the preparation is often not great.  On my most recent visit, what would have been delicious french onion soup was cold, and the cheese on top was not melted.  The seared ahi tuna was overly spicy, to the point that we couldn't taste the actual flavor of the fish.  On a previous visit, I ordered the pad thai.  This was a mistake, as the dish tasted like pure ketchup, and nothing like pad thai.  That said, service at the Walnut Grove is always good, and the wine and cocktail selections are great. The new location seems like a good spot to have a quiet drink, but the overall dining experience is so-so."}
{"text":"Limited atmosphere..  Food just okay.  Not romantic."}
{"text":"I love Walnut Grove's Sunday brunch. A great price, nice decor, pleasant service, and a great variety of food which includes prime rib. I wish that I could make their squash soup! Maryann"}
{"text":"I find the food to be over priced for the quality you receive. It's nothing to write home about in service either. Overall very mediocre food, I've tried a few different menu items from salads to steaks without much satisfaction. One positive is there is an outdoor seating area which is nice when the weather is warm."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either.  The food is ok, but nothing too original. The drinks are a bit overpriced, and the happy hour is alright if you don't mind decent-at-best well drinks.  I wouldn't advise anyone against the place, but I wouldn't reccommend it either."}
{"text":"Walnut grill is absolutely amazing. Anytime I stop in whether it is for lunch, dinner or just a happy hour - I am always pleased . Staff is friendly (from my experience) and food is delicious !"}
{"text":"This review is ONLY for their late-night bar menu. I frequent this place a lot when my mother has had a particularly hard shift at the hospital next door. Their appetizers and some wines/drinks are usually half price after 10PM. I LOVE the Chicken Pesto Pizza and the Margherita Pizza. Tons of chicken and big chunks of fresh tomatoes, respectively. Even late at night, the pizzas and apps are fresh and delicious. They often have half off wine bottles and certain drinks as well. This place is also open later than most  establishments at Waterworks, which can seem like a ghost town at night!"}
{"text":"Note: Walnut Grove has moved down the street and is now located in the Waterworks Mall (very near original location).  Took my family there for dinner, and all enjoyed it.  The sausage stuffed banana peppers were a bit hot, and the Pad Tai was delicious.  The salmon dish looked great, as did the seafood pasta.  Will go there again!"}
{"text":"Walnut grove is a great place to come whether you're just getting some drinks at the bar or looking for a nice place to go to lunch or dinner Walnut Grove has it all.   Every night they have a new drink special, and are always open late with a happy hour late night menu. The staff is wonderful and friendly! I come here often after work with friends and the staff always give us great service and provide great food.  They recently opened up an outdoor patio and this past summer extended it and added an outdoor fire pit, even in the winter you can sit outside in the patio with their flat screen tvs and outdoor heaters, just as comfortable as sitting inside. Theyre food is delicious and they're menu is always changing with new items to try.   I reccomend trying theyre hummus and butter of the day and nothing beats their salads. Thursday's are a great day to come to try one of their $5 martinis. They're menu always surprises me and the staff never fails to be accomodating! One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Aspinwall area, definitely check out Burgatory. it's right next door!"}
{"text":"Great service and good company!  I went to this restaurant on a Wednesday night so we expected no crowd.    We arrived to be greated by a great hostess.  She gave us the option of where we wanted to sit.   We were immediately greated by our terrific waiter.  He gave us the specials and let us know what were his favorite items on the menu.  We ordered an appetizer, meal and dessert.  The waiter made sure that all of our items were spread out and not brought all at the same time.  That is my favorite way to eat.  I ordered the Cobb Salad which was terrific.  I didn't even need extra dressing which is something I always get.  The flavors of the ingredients were great.  You could tell they were fresh and they were presented in a professional manner.  We also ordered dessert which was delicious.  I ordered the applie pie and cinnamon ice cream.  I gave it 4 stars because my husband ordered a pasta dish that he didn't care for.   Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience!  They provided great service and good food."}
{"text":"I have been here frequently and I overall like the place, but I went last night with my boyfriend and I have to say I was very disappointed. We were seated quickly in a booth by the bar. The bar area was nice and busy. We started off with a half price bottle of wine and tuna tacos. We had to ask if there were any specials for the night. The tacos came out quickly and while the tuna was yummy it was overall a bland appetizer. So then we ordered dinner. My first choice was on the \"chefs special\" for the day. A pork dish. We ordered and the waitress came back and told me they were out of the special-not because they sold out but because they are in the process of switching out their menu and it was not available anymore. Ok. So I went for my second choice-a seafood broth bowl. Well after I ordered the waitress came back to tell me that was not available either! For the same reason! So I went with my third choice. It would have been appreciated it the waitress would have told up us front what was not available at the beginning so we could have avoided this. We were really hungry by then. So I ordered salmon with balsamic vinaigrette and goat cheese. It came with a vegetable and a baked potato. It was good however, I have made salmon at home that tasted better and the vegetable was just shredded carrot and something else-kind of a cope out to me. My boyfriend really enjoyed his dinner. It was the tilapia chef special. I'll give them another shot, hopefully they will be done with revising the menu by that time!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with office functions and then with friends.     Nothing really jumped out of the menu that said that 'I must have that!'  Perhaps a larger portion of food to match the pricing on the menu.    Staff is always friendly.  Would go here again as it does have a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place... I drive over 1 hour and 15 minutes for the Beet Salad.. It is a must everytime I am near that area.."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day.  This is the second location of Walnut Grove for the \"Walnut Tree\" restaurant group.  The other is in Wexford and I'd have to say I like the other better.  This one is very convenient being located close to my home in Fox Chapel.  It's a pretty non-descript location and you'd probably not notice it if you didn't know it was there its in a strip mall next to Waterworks plaza.  I got here on a Saturday around 2 PM to have a bite and watch some of the game. The place was pretty much populated with friendly locals and I was surprised to see relatively brisk business.  It has a pretty big wrap around bar with a few high tops and plasmas.  There also is a dining room in the back with tables and booths.  The server was pretty friendly if a little bit slow.  They have Guiness on tap as well as several other domestic and import selections. They also have a decent selection of bottles.  I started and finished with Guiness.  I ordered the chili (I think), it was pretty forgetabble in fact the only thing I really remember is that it was cold,,, I mean like guzpachio (sp?) cold.  I then ordered the flank steak lunch portion which the server made a point of saying the chef recommends it cooked medium or less, which is fine for me since I typically order medium rare, which I did.  It arrived pretty quickly and was very much overcooked,,, I mean burnt.  What happened to the chef only recommends medium,,, meh', oh well I can't say much to how it would have tasted since it was pretty much just burnt dark matter to me.  I think they had mashed potatoes also, which were okay I guess.  I mean they were real and warm, so how hard is it is it to mess up.  I didn't return the entree' because I didn't want to upset the server, since she was so nice, but next time I'll probably stick to beer and bar food."}
{"text":"This is a newish restuarant in Pittsburgh and apparently is the second restaurant from the owners. The decor is nice, not what you would expect. The bar area is large, and seems to be perfect for watching the games, however i noticed that they only had 2 games on so it might be better to watch the local games only. The restaurant is massive, with seperate dining areas that are spacious and private.   The menu looked good. It was one of those menus where it takes about 20 minutes to figure out what you want because there are just too many choices. I finally settled on the French Onion Soup with the Caprese Salad, my mother chose the Spinach and chicken Flatbread with cottage frieds, and my grandmother chose the tilapia with a baked potato.  The soup was good - nothing great but good. The caprese salad unfortunately was another story. It looked quite good but my taste buds thought otherwise. There was too much of the balsamic reducgtion and it overpowered the tomatos to the point I could not eat them. And the fresh mozarella, oh how i was disappointed. It honestly tasted more like cold tofu than moz - tough and chewy.  Onto my mom's flatbread - it looked good but I didnt try it. The cottage fries were good though.  My grandmother absolutely loved her tilapia.   I think if I lived in Pittsburgh I would give this place another chance based upon all of the items on the menu, but I would definitely stay away from the Caprese.  Prices were very reasonable."}
