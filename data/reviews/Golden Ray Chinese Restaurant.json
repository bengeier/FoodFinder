{"text":"We came on a friday night.
The restaurant was not too busy.
We ordered a 6 lbs live lobster and a 5 lbs live eel.
What a big disappointment to this restaurant. They added too much sugar for the lobster that made the dish taste bad.

The worst part was the eel.
We suspected that they changed the live eel to a dead one behind us. The meat of that steamed eel became very soggy and smelly.  The size of the fish became smaller. That should not be the result of any fresh seafood.
When we talked about this to the manager, he tried to convince us that the origin of this eel was that like.

Such a big liar!"}
{"text":"I come here with family probably once or twice a month at a minimum. This place is really economical and food is quite good. They have fresh seafood too. We order the swatou/chiu chow style hot pot fish, and lobster often. The service is inconsistent but I think its what you can expect from this style of restaurant.

When you go at peak dinner hours parking may be an issue the lot is very small."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called Joy Fortune, as Yelp has two restaurants under the same address, and now they are called Golden Ray. But on their name plaque, it states to be Golden Joy.... This name of this restaurant is confusing, blaaaah!
Either way, it's a Chinese restaurant in the exact same address! So punch the address in when you GPS your way here instead of typing in the restaurant name.

We ordered a couple of dishes here for dinner. Nothing off a set menu or something~

As we arrived around 6pm and there were some families seated in but overall it was relatively quiet and we found a spot quickly. I didn't do any of the ordering hahaha so I was just here to sit and eat!

To start off, vegetables! Bok choy is a good staple Chinese vegetable. It came with a mini soup which actually tasted really good. It was creamy, yet light.

Next off was ribs. My parents highly recommended it and we tried it... It was actually pretty bomb. Except with ribs, it's always a messy eat for me . It was hella good though!! Totally recommend it:)

Lobster was an impulse order... I also don't quite enjoy the crispy parts outside of the shell but I mostly ate the meat anyways:)

They gave us options for dessert! Either red bean or dou fu fa/dou hua which is a soft tofu with a slight amount of sugar for taste. I am a dou fu fa loverrrr so I got dou fu fa but I'm glad that the restaurant actually gives you options of choosing your dessert as most restaurants don't.

I actually came here on Chinese New Year and the service/food wasn't as good as this time. So I would recommend coming on a non-holiday/celebration/event... actually for any restaurant! Because the price goes up as well which is always a sad thing :("}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant used to be called Joy Fortune, but it changed names and now called Golden Ray.This place is a hidden gem. The food is good for a really good price.

Came here on the weekend with my family and ordered their Double lobster and Peking duck meal for $88! The set meal serves up to 6-8 people. Comes with double lobster, Peking duck served in 2 eatings (can get the cabbage wrap for extra $8), half a chicken, sweet and sour porkchop, a fresh steamed fish and a dish of veggies. 
The food was tasty, and portions were reasonable. I still can't get over the price! Generally for the amount of food we got, all other restaurants would charge at least $100 - $300 depending where you go."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food and service. When our soup got cold, they gave us a new hot bowl and red bean congee for the 3 of us after our meal."}
