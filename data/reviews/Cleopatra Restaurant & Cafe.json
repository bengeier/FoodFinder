{"text":"Not sure if this place changed ownership or not. It's now a fried chicken place which is a huge downgrade from what it used to be.  Came here 'cause of the great reviews and expectations.   The food, atmosphere, smell, service and everything else has just changed so dramatically that we left before ordering.   Unfortunate. Was hoping for better Arabic restaurant to save us from the terrible service at Paramount."}
{"text":"I went in around 5:30pm on a Wednesday and ordered a chicken and beef shawerma plate with fries and salad. This is my first time here and the food was good. The portion was huge for 1 person. The salad was very fresh as were the fries.   I didn't know it came preloaded with hot sauce so if you are not a fan, ask for it on the side ahead of time.  The food came fast but there wasn't anyone waiting for food nor was the place busy. It is spacious and inviting.  Menu is reasonable in size and the prices are very fair.  I'd come again for sure."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good and the owner really cares about his customers, i also found out the owner actually cooks the food so that's always a plus  they used to have shisha but now they removed it, i was told they wanted it  more family friendly place so that's great for families with kids  place is huge and has a nice decor, they have a variety of dishes and staff is friendly  would come back to have a bite when i'm in the area"}
{"text":"Best food ever  Nice stuff members( the lady always always nice) Nice food portion no one left with a empty stomach Price is totally fine  I just love it"}
{"text":"Visited this place with some Yelper buddies as this event was part of the exploration of international cuisines...  The place was not hard to find as its huge and there is plenty of parking. The restaurant is very big, beautifully decorated and gives a Egyptian feel.  There are plenty of seating and we were hogging a small corner.   The buzz was that their portions are Huuuugeeeee and they are! Before the meal a round of hummus and baba ganoush with pita and pickles for the table to share was ordered... courtesy of our awesome CM. These hummus was a little sour and that how it should be and you could taste the egg plant in baba ganoush, so both appetizers were great. Their Pita came fluffy and was very nice to eat.   For the main course, we ordered chicken shawarama plate and to be honest me an wifey couldn't finish it and had to take some home. The plate can feed 3 people! the chicken was slight saltier but over all the flavor for the food was great and fresh.   The server was very patient and very nice. She made sure we had everything and later on the owner came out check if everything was good.   For my Muslim folks - They server halal meat and as per zabihah.com, a halal certificate is clearly visible on the premises of this restaurant.  The entire experience was great and easy on the pocket!"}
{"text":"Paid a visit to this spot along Dixie Rd last night with a group yelpers with a desire to explore expert international cuisines. I hear this place is busy by day with all the businesses in the area looking for great lunch spots, but for dinner last night we literally had the place to ourselves - and Cleopatra's is massive inside.  Our group decided to share hummus and baba ganoush starters, which came armed with more baskets of freshly baked, hot out of the oven, pita than we could attempt to eat in a week.  For the hungry, you only need to know two words: Mixed Grill  It comes equipped with two shish tawook (chicken kebab) skewers, 2 kafta skewers, enough rice to feed a small rural village and a side salad. It might sound like a ton, but when it comes to portions, these guys are NOT messing around. The skewers were about 2 inches around each and about 10 inches long. Impressive by any standard.  Best of all they had a promotion on last night where you received 15% off your final bill (after tax) so their already extremely reasonable prices were now even lower.  Overall a great meal, and I'm excited to come back to try the fried chicken side of their business as well as their other amazing Middle Eastern eats!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother on a Saturday evening for a quick dinner.  I am all too familiar with this strip mall near the north west corner of Dixie and Eglinton.  This place used to be a Popeye's chicken and this place still strangely enough still sells something that looks like Popeye's but it's not Popeye's.  I'm assuming it is also Halal much like other options in this mall.  The last time I actually stepped foot in this structure it was still a Popeye's about 25 months ago I believe.  The decor has REALLY changed though.  The inside of this restaurant almost makes me feel like I'm at a would be Egyptian pavillion at Epcot Center or something along those lines.  There are hieroglyphics, Egyptian type works of art and even a small 3D model of the Pyramids of Giza along one of the walls.  They are working on making what looks like a stone oven near the east part of the building, left of the counter but there are stacked chairs there as well as stacked chairs at the west side exit/entrance.  They've been open since last August I was told and there were only maybe another 2 or 3 parties in the entire place that can seat maybe 20 to 30 tables if I recall.  The place seemed rather empty and to me it seemed to be a shame.  I mean the parking at this mall was packed.  We actually had to park behind the buildings where the additional parking was because of the snow banks occupying space as well as it's generally just a busy evening I guess.  Chang and Huang had a sign saying they were closed for a couple weeks, Bamiyan Kabob was packed as usual.  Masamune has turned into KK Sushi I think (when did that happen exactly?).  Regardless this mall was pretty hopping but not many people in Cleopatra's.    The menus are at the front counter and we glanced at it there before ordering where we had to pay upfront (Cash only sign at the register FYI).  Both myself and my brother each ordered a chicken shawarma plate which included salad, our choice of either rice or fries.  We both went with rice though I should have asked if we could have half and half.  We chose our table and sat for what seemed to be only about 5 minutes before the server brought us our food.  These plates with the food on it must have weighed at least 3 pounds each.  I was sort of shocked at the size of the portion with the plate order.  The salad which was a mix of lettuce, onions, tomatos, cucumber from what I can remember made up about a third of the plate.  Try to keep in mind that salad weighs almost nothing.  Still the plate weighed 3 pounds or more.  I actually lifted the plate to feel it... it was loaded.  Rice made up the other two thirds of the plate surface while all the chicken was placed on top of the rice.  So being that the meat is on top and not taking up it's on surface space on the plate this is literally a mound of food.  The restaurant could easily make this serving 1/3 to 2/5 smaller and size and it would still be a lot of food.  The quantity is almost ridiculous for the money.  I forgot to mention the food cost me 13.55 after tax.  The serving is literally enough for 2 adults .  Needless to say neither myself or my brother finished our meals there.  I had to ask for 2 containers so we could pack it up.  This is not really something either of us does when we order our own meals and it's not family style ordering.  This is how generous this restaurant is with their servings.  We (who can eat a lot, trust me) had to actually take the rest home.    Enough about the portion size... the food itself was above average but not the best I've had.  This is however a really good meal regardless of the portion size which is extremely excessive.  The chicken has a really nice flavor while the rice is not bland mind you we both added the hot sauce they provided which is a nice orange type out of a olive oil type tall bottle.  This house hot sauce was A1 and really complimented the flavor of the chicken.  The salad?  I'm not really a salad guy but this salad was crispy, chilled properly and fresh.  When it crunches and the colors are bright that is a good thing when it comes to fresh salads.    One thing we noticed there wasn't a beef option for the plate or combo for that matter but there were beef dishes in other forms.  It would have been nice to get a taste of both but I'm not going to complain about having that delicious chicken.  So with the food being good and there being a ridiculous amount of it well this place will receive a solid 4 stars from me.  It's a full blown Mediterranean type cuisine that also has fast food style fried chicken.  This place deserves way more business than what I saw on that evening.  We'll be back considering I can feed both myself and my wife on one dish for sure."}
{"text":"I had the falafel platter from this and I was pleasantly surprised. In a plaza full of Middle Eastern/Afghan/Mediterranean food, this place definitely stands out.  The falafel platter had 6 falafels, rice, salad, tahini and fresh baked pita bread.  All this for only $7.99 plus tax.  The salad was very fresh, tahini was tasty and rice well seasoned.  But the falafels, OMG! They were nice, crispy and well flavoured.    Verdict: Gonna be my next go to place for Mediterranean food when I'm in the area.  PS: hot sauce is good but more or less like a thicker Peri Peri sauce."}
{"text":"Came for a community event with a few other hungry yelpers. Before ordering commenced the buzz around the table was how big the portions here were. My best friend and I ordered a chicken dinner to share due to the warnings.   Our awesome CM ousted some hummus and baba ganoush with pita for the table to share. You know they were delicious because some of us were full by the time the mains came. Who could resist the hot and puffy pitas right out of the brick oven.   The meal was huge,  we both had our share and both took home or next day's lunch. All for their hot sauce to go with their flavor packed garlic sauce.   They also have fried chicken. ..Strange I know but at around $5 I won't argue.   The woman who served us was nice and patient.   I would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Huge Portions! And great prices. Can't say how awesome this place is enough. Also cool inside. Great for larger groups!   I tried the vegetarian plate as I don't eat meat and it was awesome!! Huge!! And everything was fresh."}
{"text":"My first-ever review and wont be my last. Ordered the Markie's fried chicken and it was delicious. Moist and juicy and the portion size was great. Over all very satisfied and will visit again end of week and try some main dishes"}
{"text":"3-3.5, food was tasty, but over-seasoned.  First of all, can I say how much competition is in this smallish, U-shaped plaza??  It's just crazy!  There's Bamiyan, Panorama (Paramount knock-off), King Kebab (formerly known as Turkish King Kebab), & a bunch of other places that I've never been to, but this gives you an idea of what's in the immediate vicinity.  The Good: -  15% off 'til end of May - SCORE! -  informal dining, re:  no tip type place  ;) -  large dining room -  food came quickly after ordering (less than 10mins) -  female staff was very nice -  meal came with 2 freshly made pitas -  portions are HUGE, platters are good for 2-3ppl! -  food was tasty, but please see following segment  The Not-So-Good -  even though food was tasty, I found everything over-seasoned from fattoush salad - side salad (too much Italian dressing) - chicken shawarma (too salty) - fries (waaay, waaay too salty)  That over dressing thing was my only complaint.  My mouth was so dry after eating all the components, especially the fries.  The fries did have a nice seasoning on it, but it was just too salty to enjoy.  Not an ideal place to take anyone with Hypertension.  Tip:  If you're ordering a salad - or even getting a salad on the side - I'd ask for it on the side &/or enjoy it with no seasoning.  And ask for NO SALT on the fries."}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel plate and was pleasantly surprised.  I chose to get the rice as a side which definitely made the meal heavy. Portions sizes are great. Not small and not too large. Food came a bit slow but I think they are working out the kinks from just opening (last month). Good news was it was fresh.  The falafels were crispy on the outside and soft inside. Ask for their hot sauce. Spicy and flavourful."}
