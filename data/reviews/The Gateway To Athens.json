{"text":"Not happy with my meal. I got the Mama Mia which is gyro meat on top of a small amount of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, and a dozen small pieces of pita bread. All I could taste was oregano! The meat and the bread were heavy on Oregano, the bread seriously covered. Another odd thing is that their Greek salad doesn't have greek olives. No olives. I also bought a cupcake, which was dry and crumbly as cornbread. It was obviously old."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you receive. Love greek food, but will no longer shop here.  A few years ago, the food was terrific, but now, it is mediocre.  Don't know why, but certainly evident in the quality and flavor  Mediocre greek food."}
{"text":"Best gyros we have ever had. Great homemade chips and friendly service. Everything is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"The Gateway to Athens is a very casual local Greek setting.   If you are looking for upscale, this is not the place.   The food is fabulous, always fresh at great prices!  The fare is entirely greek and is owned by a local greek family who make the best homemade potato chips.  My kids go often and love the Gyro and Tzviki.  There is a childrens menu for those small ones not interested in Greek food.  The service is sometime sketchy depending on how busy they are, but the outside seating makes it a great different summer time choice!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here in the evening.  Because the weather was pleasant, we sat at one of the four outside tables.  The two servers on duty, Michelle and Matt, were attentive to our needs.  My wife had the chicken plaka served over Greek style rice and pita bread with the house salad.  I had a large Mama Mia Bowl which consisted of falafel on lettuce, tomatoes, and onions topped by a scoop of mouthwatering tzatzika sauce and surrounded by tasty pita bread drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with oregano.  
Both meals were extremely generous and delicious.
Gateway to Athens serves authentic Greek food in a family-friendly atmosphere.  We plan to be regular customers."}
{"text":"Small quaint location. The food is consistently good. I could eat here multiple times per week."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to come for Greek food. The gyro will melt in your mouth and the owner is as nice as he can be. Very laid back place with a simple but flavorful menu selection. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I lived in Rafina Greece for two years.  Gateway to Athens is the best Greek restaurant I have found this side of the Aegean"}
{"text":"The food here was good. A bit on the over priced side for what it is. The homemade chips are a nice touch. i tried the Gyro. The place is nestled away  so it may be hard to find but once you have been there its pretty easy to find."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and cooked to order and the owners and servers treat you like family.  Reminds me of high school days when we stop by one of our friends house whose parents were from Greece and his mom and grandma would feed us like kings with authentic Greek food."}
{"text":"This place definitely surprised me. I don't live close to the area, but will make more trips to the furniture depot often and make this my lunch stop. The Gyro NY style, spicy was amazing. The falafels were so good! Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I live in Lexington, SC and will only eat Greek food here. The atmosphere is wonderful, the staff is very nice and the food is divine. Wish we had one close to home, would give this place 10 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 50 minutes for food and not 20 as was told, only to be told they were out of gyros meat for my order if i would like to order something else. The poor waitress was on her first day and got constantly yelled at. The owner was a straight up bitch."}
{"text":"Horrible service, late, slow. If u want to drink coffee they gonna give it to you like a kids cup. Be ready to have your food ready over hour. It was first time for me. Definitely last time too.
Ps: U guys aren't long horn. What the hell are those prices?"}
{"text":"Had high expectations.    Selected Moussaka (its my guide to a great Greek restaurant).

It was either old, frozen and reheated or just a bad chef day.    Very little meat.   Lots of potatoes (shame) and a few peeks of eggplant.    The bechamel was virtually non existent and it was \"covered\" in an abundant amount of yellow cheese.   Bland and disappointing.   Bypass this plate.    The worse part was it was priced at $12 with a garden salad.      I wanted a Greek salad to see how it measured up and with the additional 2.50 .   The salad was nothing special although the salad dressing was better than the competiition nearby that serves \"pink\" dressing. 

My lunch companion ordered a greek salad with gyro meat.    It came with no bread or sauces.. so she ordered Tzatziki to dunk and it had WAY to much dill.    Really?   Dill?   Ruined the meat taste and added $2 to her tab.     

Waitress is the fastest talking person I have ever heard.    Gets the job done if there aren't more than 2 tables occupied....    Then things get a bit slower both in service and kitchen.   

I would like to go back and try something else, but .....     I'll think about it."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and always had excellent food and service. Gyros, Souvlaki, moussaka all delicious with nice fresh salads and the best tzatziki. Good selection of greek beers and Retsina and always comforting to walk in to such a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat in Concord: always friendly, family service, great atmosphere and the best Gyros I've ever had! The only thing better than the gyros is the hummus and falafel!!
Great for dine-in or carry out"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try this place after passing by it so many times, so we went for lunch. We were able to be seated within five minutes and my daughter saw the mural painted on the back wall and thought it to be a perfect backdrop for a picture to remember our first time here.
She ordered a falafel gyro with regular fries, and I had the small Mama Mia bowl with falafel. Their tzatziki is fantastic!! The falafel was very good too, not greasy at all. We look forward to visiting again to try something else off of the menu--they have a lot of Greek dishes that sound delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here right after they first opened back in 2005 or 06 and I have to say that it is one of, if not the, best Greek Restaurants I know. The lady who owns and operates this place told me that it took her 3 days to make the tzatziki sauce which I have to say is da bomb. I love the Gyro's here and get them each and every time we go."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town. Moderate prices with healthy portions. Clean and friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, had the rice bowl with gyro meat. Already planning to bring family when they are in town!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in concord. Service can be spotty because it's a small business but the gyro meat is to die for. Also have 1/2 price bottles of wine in Wednesday's which is a great deal at this place."}
{"text":"The food was really good. My salad was really fresh and the chicken pie was sooo good! Spinach dip was delicious. Highly recommended. It's not a fast food place. You aren't rushed in and out."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, great value. We started with the hummus and the bread and hummus was incredible. My wife has the Green chicken and potatoes and the chicken was fall of the bone. I had the BLT Pita with fries and it was excellent with a perfect amount of bacon. 

The staff is friendly, tentative, and the menus give a good description of each item. 

I highly recommend this little hidden gem in Afton Village."}
{"text":"Aaaaaaaaaah Greece, The Gateway to Athen's was an excellent restaurant. The service was awesome and the food very good. We have passed the restaurant for about a year and my wife said lets try it out. We did and thought that the experience with the food and device was out of this world. We will be back and try new things to try to get the real taste of Greece..... Would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"The food was decent. The portions were small though. We paid $6.50 for a hummus appetizer and probably got 1/4 cup of hummus. We ordered a mamma Mia I just wanted a bite and we were charged a $3 plate share fee which was not listed anywhere on the menu. For an appetizer 2 waters and a salad our bill came out to $23. It was definitely not worth it and we will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, we really enjoyed the food here. The gyro quesadilla was very tasty and a convenient quick meal on the go. The hummus is good and so is the tzatziki. My only real complaint is the price for what you get. A small 2oz cup of hummus was $2 plus tax. For perspective, that's only 4 tablespoons.  The tzatziki is similarly over priced. They're both good, but not that good."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros and homemade chips! Wow! It taste like the real stuff I had in Mykonos and would go more often if it only cost as much as it did in Athens."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Gateway to Athens for 8 years and I have to say they have the best gyro I have EVER HAD anywhere and I'm a flight attendant so I try them all over the United States. 

This is a family owned (from Greece) and run business and both mom and daughter's talents are nothing short of amazing. People don't always understand that small business owners do everything themselves so yes, there may be times when you have to wait a little longer during peak business hours, but the food is well worth the wait. 

I have shared this restaurant with many friends and everyone has loved it and they have shared as well. Thank You to the Gould's for continuing to provide excellent quality Greek food and sharing your family traditions :) we love it!!"}
{"text":"I get cravings from this place after I don't go back in awhile. It is located right between Smoothie King and E Noodles. It's a rather small place and every time I come, there is never a wait. I personally think this local place is delicious, and I would think it would always be packed full of people. My absolute favorite thing to get is the Half Size Chicken Rice Bowl. Ohhhhhh my goodness, it's amazing. The rice is always cooked perfectly. The bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions adds the perfect flavors to the chicken and rice. And on top of that, you get feta cheese. The entire blend is perfect. Sometimes, it can get a little salty though. I get very picky with falafel. This place has some of the best falafel I have ever had. It's not dry and it tastes very good. 

There is cool music always playing in the restaurant and the backdrop makes me feel like I am eating in another part of the world. The servers are friendly and patient as well! I will be coming here for years to come as my go-to Greek spot."}
{"text":"This place was god awful! I stopped by here the other night with my bestie for  a quick bite after a day of shopping. Upon entering the restaurant we were promptly seated and then left for about 15 minutes without drinks or anything. Finally our waitress came and took our drink order. A few moments later we decided we would like to sit outside since it had cooled of significantly from the rain and setting sun. We got up and informed the waitress that we were moving outside. She had our drinks in her hand and simply said that was fine and for us to choose the table of our choice. The next thing I know my friend and I are outside for another 10 minutes before the waitress brought our drinks out. Finally our order was placed and the food came out rather quickly the only problem my Kefta was undercooked ..and I couldn't inform the waitress because she never came back..she was busy cleaning and the manager of the store never came out either. (note there was only one other table dining and they were also outside). To me that demonstrates there is no excuse for the service we received. We ended up boxing up the meat for the dogs and munching on the chips. When we got up to leave I mentioned to the waitress that the meat was undercooked...she got the manager who basically pounced on me and asked if it was so undercooked why I had ate a few pieces I explained they werent all undercooked and she kept telling me that is how the dish is supposed to be. I have been to greece..and I dine at many arab restraunts Kefta is not served at that texture nor is it served undercooked. Also I did not ask for a discount or anything of the sort yet the manager jumped all down my back. SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you want Greek go elsewhere! 

WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! Should have known with a Carolina waitress, a British manager, and non-Greek cooks that the food would be sub par!
Negatives-
-terrible service
-RUDE manager
-Overpriced (potato slices and 5 kefta pieces 10 dollars)
-UNDERCOOKED

Positive -
Sweet wait staff (just inexperienced and overworked due to lazy manager)"}
{"text":"Get the tziki!!! Chicken skewers were really good. Had them over a bed of grilled veggies which were also awesome. Wife had salad with the same grilled chicken and she said it was amazing."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming about Moussaka for a long time but unfortunately it's hard to find a Greek restaurant that serve this dish! 
I was browsing on Yelp for a Greek restaurant in Concord when I found this one.
By the reviews and the pictures I got really tempted on checking them out specially when I saw Moussaka on their menu, so I did! We got there a little bit early for dinner which was good so they were not that busy. Our waitress was really nice, when we got to our tables the menus were already there and she asked what we would like to drink. 
I knew since before I get there what I wanted for dinner but my husband needed some extra time. 
He decided for a Philly cheese steak pita and of course I had the Moussaka.
The food came out pretty fast and My Moussaka was delicious! The best I've ever had in CLT!
My husband said his food was good too.
Their prices are fair, the service is good and the food is really good!"}
{"text":"Short version: if you don't mind rich/buttery/greasy/cheesy food, this place is worth checking out. If you'd prefer the lighter side of greek fare, this may not be for you. They do have salads and wraps but I'm referring to hot dishes.

Long version: Small restaurant with a couple of outdoor tables and about 10 tables inside. Went for lunch on a Sunday and was the only person there and then is slowly started to get busy. 

I usually regard Greek cuisine as being quite healthy but this menu is actually full of their more rich foods. Tried to order the Greek Style Baked Chicken and Potatoes but they were out so I ordered the Moussaka and Spanakopita a gyro and a falafel appetizer. 

I asked for Moussaka without cheese but they put cheese on it anyway, tons of it. I was starving so I did my best to peel off the top layer and eat the rest. 

All the items were good, but nothing was really \"wow\". Except for the gyro and falafel, everything was really heavy-tons of butter/greasy/cheesy. I don't particularly like when the philo dough on the Spanakopita leaves my fingers greasy. If you don't mind that, then you'll find the food great. I would definitely return to try other items on their menu just to be fair.

The service was kind of slow also. They only had 1 young lady tending to take outs, outdoor seating and indoor. A bus boy came in about an hour after we arrived and we ended up having to flag him down for tea refills and the check because the young lady was just swamped. 

Bottom line: I would definitely return and try other items on the menu like their rice bowls or burgers."}
{"text":"Small family business that turns out fantastic Greek food! Love their tzatziki sauce!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, great Greek music, and wonderful waitresses. Had a great time passing through on the way to Atlanta!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bad service.  Food has been good at times and bad other times.  They have literally told me before that the service is bad because it's a family run business and they don't ever have enough people working.  It's ok to hire employees...if you don't want to go out of business."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here while returning home from our trip to Virginia to visit family.  We were actually looking for Shane's BBQ but had trouble locating it so we looked this up on Yelp and gave it a try.  I love Greek food, other than spicy Thai, Greek at the top of my list for foods I love.  

In an effort to compare this restaurants to the ones I like in Greenville, SC I ordered the Gyro Salad.  They had a 1/2 Salad with Meat for lunch so I gave it a try.  Now if I loved carrots, this would have been like the greatest meal ever, but since I generally order a Gyro salad for the Gyro meat and the lettuce, I'll admit I was a bit disappointed with my carrot salad.  My wife ordered the Greek Style Baked Chicken & Potatoes, the potatoes were decent, but the chicken was grey, dry and generally unappetizing.  I suspect, it had been prepared early and reheated and just didn't stand up well to the reheating.  

My sons ordered the Pepperoni Pizza on Pita bread and both of them loved theirs.  My daughter very much liked hers as well.  It's possible things were just off on a holiday weekend, but all in all this wasn't the best experience."}
{"text":"A wonderful authentic Greek restaurant with incredibly fresh and flavorful food. 
Will definitely return every time I travel through Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was from out of town, in Concord on business.  I was craving some Greek, so I decided to check out Gateway to Athens, as it was near my job site.

First, it's a restaurant in what is essentially a strip mall.  This limits the size of the place (both dining room and I'm guessing kitchen).  Still, they had some murals depicting Greece painted on the walls.  However, the music piped in over the dining room system was some local radio station.  Even I have the soundtrack to _Zorba_.

The staff was quite friendly and prompt.  For Saturday lunch, there weren't that many people there.  On to the food.

The menu was surprisingly sparse.  They had your typical gyros, kjebabs, and pizza, plus tzatziki, spanikopita, moussaka, and pastitio.  Meat options were beef, pork, or chicken.

No saganaki.  No dolmadikia.  No lamb.

I ordered the spanakopita and a salad.  The salad was just hearts of romaine, cucumber and tomato.  No red onion.  No feta.  No olives.  No pepperoncini.  The house greek dressing was pretty good, though.  

However, the spanakopita was _very good_.


The bottom line:  I think Gateway to Athens suffers from being \"too ethnic\" in a part of the world where Mexican and Chinese buffet are considered \"exotic.\"  For the area, it's good food, but in the world-at-large, I've had better."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered The Gateway to Athens a couple months ago and we've shared a meal there on an almost weekly basis since then. The food is absolutely incredible and truly authentic. This is a family owned and operated business that doesn't cut corners on service or quality. Oftentimes we are served by the owner's daughter while other family members are busy preparing food in the kitchen.

If you choose to give it a try (and I hope you will), I highly recommend the  Greek Style Rice Bowl with a side of tzatziki. 

Trust me, you won't be disappointed for making this stop. And , you might just come to the same conclusion I have: This restaurant is putting out some of the best food in the area."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon lunch on the patio was great! My first visit. I had the traditional gyro and side salad. Their gyro is the best I've had in Charlotte. Meat seasoning was great as was the tzatziki! The baklava was outstanding! Service was friendly and quick! Looking forward to going back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Very good greek food.  Probably the best I've had in Charlotte so far.  Unfortunately for me, it's a very far drive.  I had the Chicken Souvlaki and it was on point.  The fries were very good too.  The service was borderline overboard but it was probably bc we were close to closing time on a weekday and no one else was there.  I will make it back someday despite it being so far away."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here after church one Sunday afternoon. We knew it would be an adventure with our one and three-year olds but I really wanted a gyro! There were a handful of tables outside but since it was 8 billion degrees we opted for indoor seating. They have a small seating area with maybe 5/6 booths and 4 tables (I think). We were greeted by two friendly staff members.  We arrived at 12 and it filled up quickly. They had crayons and coloring sheets for the kids. The server who waited on us was polite and patient with our kids even when they got fussy (and messy). It did seem to take a while for our food to come out but not too long -  just longer than I expected. Like they had one person cooking all of it. It's definitely a family business. When the food did come out it was very tasty! I had a gyro and fries, kids had the \"pizza\" (pita with sauce and cheese) and fruit cup (Diced pears from the grocery store in a sealed plastic cup). My husband had the Mama Mia bowl and liked it. Grilled veggies and falafel. Overall good food, slowish service but very polite. I would eat here again but get the food to go."}
{"text":"Their gyro is out of this world. It's juicy and perfectly seasoned and the staff was incredibly polite and helpful.  If you're looking for a taste of Greece in Concord look no further.  Gateway to Athens is delicious.  I would recommend the Greek rice bowl!"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM. Every time I come here I'm a little surprise that it's not busy or filled considering how small the place is! Sure the place may be small, but the food & service is absolutely phenomenal. Also it has that \"your local small family own\" restaurant vibe too it. So I never had \"authentic Greek food\" before, I don't really know how it's suppose to taste, but I do really enjoy the food here! My favorite would have to be the Mama Mia bowl, or the rice bowl with the fafalel/ yum! I also love how light and \"healthy\" the Greek food is(: And oh gee the people here are sososososo friendly!! I just really appreciate truly nice & positive/happy servers(:"}
{"text":"This place sits in the thriving Afton Village area and has all the potential to be a great hole in the wall Greek restaurant. They have a nice variety of options on their menu from salads to gyros. My wife loves this place because of the Keftedes (Greek meatballs). They were a good starter dish for us to split.

I chose to go with a burger this time and it was a pretty good burger with lots of flavor. The beer battered fries were a nice addition to the entree as well. 

By now you're probably wondering what went wrong for the 3-star review. That would be the service. Service is one of those things that can make or break a restaurant. On this occasion is wasn't all too stellar. I don't fully blame the wait staff because I believe they could have used a few more servers to help with the crowd. 

I will go back because I do enjoy the food and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good basic Greek food.  Not fancy but the food was very good.  Staff seemed rushed but very attentive and polite. I like that they have vegetarian items or will modify the dish removing meats."}
{"text":"Love this place! I don't know what authentic Greek food tastes like but it's the best I've ever had in the states! I get the chicken or Gyro NY Combo and love it. It's hard to eat because it's a bit big but that's a problem that's worth having."}
{"text":"I have Visited here quite a few times and really enjoy the place. Today I dined in for the first time and had a great experience as usual. The dining area is very small, having only about 10 tables that hold 4-6 people. Little did I know how many hats the lady at the counter wears! She is the waitress, tends to carry-out orders and prepares the baked goods. I had been eyeballing the desserts every time I come in because they look very heavenly. So today I had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake and I wish I hadn't. I am vowing to not try another dessert from here ever again because I don't want to blow up! Yes try it ;-)



Even though the place is small, it has good atmosphere. There is also a patio. Prices are pretty steep for what they offer. I usually get falafels, pita and a salad. Initially I didn't like the falafels. The texture was too crunchy, but it seems they have improved. It is family-owned and the staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I were going to a movie at concord mills and wanted to eat somewhere away from the hectic restaurants near the mall. We both love Greek food so we decided to come here. There was no wait, the staff was very friendly and attentive. Our food came out fairly quick. 

I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Pita with French Fries. The Cheesesteak was really good, but had more tzatziki sauce than I would prefer. However, I normally don't like it at all and their sauce was good. The pita overall was something I would get again. The French Fries, were some of the best I've ever had. The flavor was great and they tasted amazing. The prices were less than I expected, which is a good thing. 

I would highly recommend you check this place out if you are in the area. The menu has a lot of options to choose from and I can't wait to try more food."}
{"text":"Being from Norfolk VA home of one the  biggest Greek festivals and Greek populations in America I may be spoiled and accustomed to what real Greek food taste like. I must say they TRIED but failed. the food was ok but I had a pound of rice and 2 ounces of meat. Where's the beef gateway?"}
{"text":"Had passed by Gateway many times but never stopped.  Finally was in the area and made it a point to stop by.  So glad that we did.   

Started off with the Humus appetizer and man was it good.  Flavor was really on point.   Then onto the mains.   My wife had the Gyro Greek Salad.   She really enjoyed the salad.  Portion was huge and the. Gyro meat was perfectly seasoned.  Her comment was, \"I didn't need any sauce the meat was so good.\"   I had the Greek Style Rice Bowl with house salad.  Again the portions were really good.  I didn't need the side salad.  The side salad was very tasty.  Good amount of vegetables and the feta was incredible.   The rice bowl was rich in flavor and again the meat was done to perfection.   

Service was good as they checked on us consistently.   Really enjoyed the atmosphere as it reminded us of a cafe in Greece.   

This is a great place and would recommend Gateway to Athens to everyone."}
{"text":"Service not good nor was the food the price is very high. I will not go back.  Two other people in small dining area said they had gone up on the prices.  I wish I had know the chips should have been hot I would have sent them back like the others in the dining room did.   When we walked in the restaurant the \" hostess / server\" asked us what we needed not how many in our party.  We should have left at that time."}
{"text":"I just popped by to grab a quick lunch and tried the falafel sandwich and beer battered fries. The tzatziki and hummus taste homemade and the falafel itself was moist!! I had to make myself stop eating the fries but they were absolutely addictive. Stop by here if you want the best falafel in Charlotte!! I didn't even mind that the falafel wasn't in \"ball\" form."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food. American choices too. Haven't had anything I truly haven't enjoyed. Not a large place, but the outdoor seating choices makes it feel much larger. At lunchtime the server knew the clientele by name and what they usually ordered."}
{"text":"I need to start this review by saying that I am from NY and thus can be very biased when it comes to Greek food since it's so readily available around my home. That being said - this meal just wasn't the best.

Service itself was great - my waitress was a sweetheart and helped me choose what to order off their large menu. I went with the bowl option instead of the Greek salad as she assured me that it came with more pita. That was correct!

The bowl itself was beautiful - but it was so bland!! Huge tomatoes, lettuce, 20 lbs of pita and the most dry falafel I've ever had. In addition, no dressing and just tzatziki sauce (which was actually very good).

Overall, mediocre experience."}
{"text":"The BEST Greek food you will find in this area. Gyro is always fresh and just amazing. Staff is always extremely nice, sometimes there is a small wait ( but it is a small location ). Great experience with the restaurant for the past few years."}
{"text":"Only had the falafel app with yummy tahini sauce it was some of the best I've had thus far!  I'll try dinner next"}
{"text":"I'm in Concord, NC and saw this place on Yelp as being near me. I'm always down for some Greek food, so I rolled over there to check it out. It could stand to use a little updating inside. The old style hard wooden booths aren't my fav.  Had a greek salad and a chicken skewer with rice dish. All were good and the chili sauce was a great topper to the chicken and rice.  I'd be back but would most likely do take-out."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!!!  Awesome gyros and homemade chips!  You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Gateway to Athens is a good place for a tasty, casual dinner. I don't have a whole lot of experience with Greek food, but this is how I wanted it to taste. As a lover of all layered foods containing meat amd cheese, I figured the moussaka would be a good choice. Thankfully, I was right! The flavor was great, the spices truly complimented the meat and eggplant. I also had the hummus as an appetizer. I love good hummus, and this was definitely good hummus!

The casual and friendly atmosphere was right up my alley. The service was very friendly, it was nice to feel so welcome when I was hungry after spening the previous several hours shopping. The food did come out after a slightly long wait, but they were very busy at the time (7:00 on a Saturday night), and it's a smaller restaurant. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the special of gyro with bacon and cheese. It was yummy and fresh and delicious. I ordered the homemade chips as my side. Jim ordered the gyro with beer batter fries. Very good and fresh ingredients. This place is not cheap, in fact our 2 entrees and 2 drinks totaled $30 which is overpriced for lunch considering the drink was not included in my lunch special. Good but very pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Friendly service and wonderful food. Great with the kids too."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised to find such good Greek food in Concord! I've visited Gateway to Athens twice - once for takeout and once for a sit-down meal, and both times it was excellent. 
My takeout order took very little time (I dropped by on a whim and didn't call it in), and the gyro combo was excellent. The meat was tasty, the pita was soft, and the fries were crispy and hot even after driving 10 minutes home. I came in more recently for a date and was equally impressed. We split hummus and fiery feta apps, and let me tell you, the fiery feta dip should definitely be ordered. Their grilled pita was well seasoned and honestly tasted great on its own, and the hummus was solid. We split a Greek calzone with gyro meat as an entree..and thank god we split it because it was huge! It was really tasty too. They added a good amount of cheese and peppers to boost the flavor but not too much too overpower the gyro meat and pita. Only one server was working, and she covered the entire 6-7 tables inside, but service didn't suffer and she was very nice.
I'd definitely recommend this place for quick, quality takeout or a casual sit-down meal if you're in the mood for some Greek food!"}
{"text":"3 stars because the food is AMAZING!!! I got the mamma Mia bowl (small) and added falafel and it was sooooo good! The tsataki sauce is to die for! The food and tea came to $15. The service, on the other hand, sucks. The restaurant was just moderately busy, and I wasn't checked on once. If there is a next time, I will just place an order to go."}
{"text":"If I had never been to Mykinos at Copperfield I would say this restaurant was excellent but I have and I can't. I did like the slouvaki and the tzatziki sauce was pretty good. I liked the rice. It was a little dry but flavorful. The service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"This place has decent greek food, but its a bit pricey for the amount of food they give you. If you order the gyro, ask for a little bit of lettuce (if you don't you will see why I say this). Spanakopita is pretty good, but they can go lighter on the butter. They have Mythos beer which is nice! I don't mean to be a harsh reviewer but I have been spoiled by greek food in New York and I am part greek myself! OPA!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and bland. Additionally my beer was warm. It took over a half an hour for the server to bring the order (two salads and a sandwich), all of which were meatless. Afterwards our server did not checked on our table until the very end to pick the plates and inform us to pay at the register. I'm not sure what's going on with this restaurant but they need to get it together. Not a good look, when the server is mopping floors and serving meals.

I do not recommend this restaurant, there are better establishments out there."}
{"text":"Great Gyros. Meat is fresh off of the spit and not pre-packaged slices. Tsatziki is a little different, heavier on the dill, but still really good."}
{"text":"I've been to Gateway to Athens several times.  It is a small restaurant with some patio seating outside.  It was a beautiful evening, so we chose to sit outside.  

We started with the Keftethes (Greek Style Meatballs) and just as always, they were delicious.   It was a group of three of us so we ordered the snack size that comes with 4 meatballs,  4 oz. Tzatziki sauce, chips, and bread. 

I ordered the traditional Greek salad and added grilled chicken.  This is my go-to item on the menu.  I get the smaller portion and still always end up taking some to go. There is never enough chicken for my liking, so I had steal some off my mom's plate :).

Service was a little slow. It was a week night, but I only saw two waitresses and they were very busy. My husband had to wait over ten minutes for his tea (I think they said something about having to make more). The waitress was kind but just couldn't do everything herself. My husband also had to get up and walk inside to get the check. If you can get past the somewhat slow service, it's definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My 13 year old son and I had a lunch date today at Gateway to Athens.  It was absolutely delicious!  We ordered two appetizers, falafel with hummus and tzatziki with grilled pita chips, and split an order of pastitsio.  The tzatziki and hummus were super fresh and flavorful.  The pastitsio was a very large portion that came with four little pieces of bread.  They were drizzled with oil and herbs.  It also came with a salad which we actually took home because we were too full to eat it.  We opted to skip it so we could eat our entree.  All in all, it was a great experience.  We will definitely be going back.  They have a card that you can get stamped to eventually save 8 bucks off your order.  Our lunch did take just over an hour from beginning to end because everything is made to order so make sure you give yourself enough time."}
{"text":"We stopped at this cute cafe for lunch. We were promptly sat and the atmosphere was nice. We ordered right away, fairly simple items. However, nearly 40 minutes later, nothing was served yet. We were told our appetizers would be served in \"a few minutes\" more than 5 more minutes passed when my husband finally started to complain. Finally our dolmades came out, and they were very good. Soups follows a few minutes later, a few minutes after that the pita and dip showed up. We had specifically asked nothing to be courses because we were trying to be quick. Daughters chicken nuggets never showed, waitress forgot to even put our order in for the gyros. We really needed to leave so we paid up and realized that item missing. Tried to add it in quickly, then she starts saying she forgot to charge for other things as well. At this point, husband is angry. Overhears kitchen staff laughing and deciding what to put in our food. At this point he's livid. Staff is being rude. We left having paid $60 in food, half of which we never received. Very unfortunate as the soup was great, the grape leaves delicious, but rude customer service response to the terribly slow service and numerous order mistakes made and kitchen threat of sabotaging our food ensure that we will never return."}
{"text":"Cute little greek spot. First timer at this restaurant and I was not disappointed. The restaurant had a \"family\" feel to it and you could tell it was family owned due to the family photos on the wall. The hostess/server/cashier was very friendly. The menu was rather large so it was hard to choose however I stuck with the classic gyro sandwich and it was the BEST i've ever had. The portion was great and the sauce paired perfect with the lamb. I will definitely be coming back to try more items."}
{"text":"Lean cuisine makes a better Greek meal than this place. Service was just about as good. Kept rushing us to finish so they could close exactly at 9. No wonder this place was empty."}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek food I have ever had! If you haven't tried it, you're missing out. The souvlaki is great, the gyros are delicious. And the baklava is to die for. I have taken several friends there who are jealous that they don't have a Greek restaurant this delicious near them. The restaurant is small inside and the decor/atmosphere isn't anything to write home about. But it doesn't matter one bit because the food is why you go here. Yum!"}
{"text":"If you love Greek food and on a tight budget then check this place. I always love coming here and I love their Gyros the best. I love the Greek music they have playing also. The staff are always ready to serve and friendly."}
{"text":"Try the firey feta OH MY GOSH. This was hands down one of the best dips I've ever had!!!! I also had the spanakopita, it was okay, probably wouldn't get it again. But the firey feta deserves 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice before, so this makes number three.  I have always ordered take out, so I have no idea how their table service is, but take out is about a 15 minute wait.  

I am a big fan of Spinach pie, and they make a darn fine one. The truth is Greek food is one of my favorite foods. They have a full Greek menu.  Every time I have gone here, I have enjoyed what I have ordered.  Their hummus and tzatziki sauce [in my opinion] is perfection!  

This is my issue with this place.  Their portions are not as generous as I have come to expect with Greek eateries.  For example you pay two bucks for a side of hummus, and it's literally a thimble full.  There are no pita chips or anything with it.  It is a 2 oz. clear condiment cup.  I was irritated when I saw the size of it, and could not believe they had the audacity to charge $2.00 for that.  Seriously.  

The people are personable, and their food really is delightful, but I am really bothered by their parsimonious attitude towards their patrons.  It is that simple fact that has stopped this customer from becoming a client."}
{"text":"I would more honestly give this place 3.5 stars, but there's no option for that. 

The ambiance is lacking. All of the art on the walls is hung crooked and the whole place is very dark. As we ate, the specials sign fell off the wall. It was pretty weird. 

Our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink while we were halfway to the table. She seemed impatient and the rest of the wait staff seemed very on-edge. 

The food was delicious, although my pita with falafel had an absurd amount of lettuce on it, which I felt bad about picking off, but it was just too much. There was also a ridiculous mound of fries on my plate, and the falafel pita could have had more falafel. 

The restaurant advertises themselves as authentic Greek food, but they have all sorts of weird, made-up dishes on the menu, such as \"Greek nachos.\" This seems very unnecessary to me. I think if they focused on making their actual authentic food really really good, they could do away with those items on the menu that are only there to satiate our American tastebuds."}
{"text":"I found this little gem while driving around. I'm a sucker for Greek food so I gave it a shot. This is a mom and pop family owned Greek restaurant that serves REAL authentic Greek food. The location is very easy to get in and out of. The restaurant was very clean in the inside. They have plenty of outdoor seating in front of restaurant. The prices are very reasonable considering the portion sizes you get. I ordered the Spinach Dip and Gyros and they were both out of this world. It's the best Greek food I've tried in Concord and also in a long time. You definitely need to try this place!"}
