{"text":"If you are looking for a intimate restaurant,romantic styled resto.Well,this is the place! although the appetizers menu is not much of a choice.The entree is definitely well worth,and good portion.The taste of the osso bucco, or pescatore dish was well worth it! I definitely would suggest"}
{"text":"That was a great business dinner. Impeccable!!! Starters were yummy and well presented. Had a 10oz fillet, perfect cooking , perfect flavour, tender and very well presented. Had a great selection of wine. A little bit too much , ha ha  . Our server was very pleasant, very professional, whenever we ask fir something , she will get it in a breeze.  I definitely recommend that place."}

{"text":"This restaurant has a plush and romantic feel to it.  It is fairly quiet without the louder music that some restaurants in the area have.   So, if your looking for a romantic evening out or a business dinner it's great.  For a wild night out, not so much.    The food was good but not the best.  The steaks were a bit \"fatty\"'and the veal was just decent but not great.  The wines were a bit off too for my taste.  This is a nice place but my experience this time was average.  I will end up here again I'm sure and update the review.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Belle place dans le coin du Centropolis. Repas délicieux et excellent service pour l'heure du diner. Le poisson était trop bon."}
