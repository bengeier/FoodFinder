{"text":"Working with Jeremy was a pleasure . The price for the food was very fair. The food was very good. Best BBQ chicken I've had in Pittsburgh!! Fruit was fresh with a tasty dip. Sandwiches were good quality as well as the appetizer. Very good. Very pleased with the presentation of the food as well. Will be going back!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the food and have never tried anything that wasn't just utterly delicious. I've tried everything from the soups and sandwiches to appetizers and sides- Great! Everything is fresh and made with care. Anyone interested in experiencing the pinnacle of bar food needs to try the gyro bacon cheeseburger. We have used the catering as well for family events and had compliments on everything we ordered! Eat here!"}
{"text":"The Best Hoagies in the valley !!!!!  The Spit fired meats are Bomb.  Friendly staff an Reasonable prices.  I would walk 10.000 miles, to get me a Big Hog"}
{"text":"I ordered take out food several times for my family from Spitfirez.  I read the reviews and expected to find great food in the bags when I got home. Sadly, that was not the case. The chicken fingers/strips were under and over cooked.  The outside breading was burnt/overcooked/too crunchy to bite but when we cut them open the chicken was pink/not cooked in the middle. I ordered a sandwich for my husband and he said that it was ok. I had good soup last winter. It was hot sausage soup. That is a good and bad thing. I called several times after that to ask about it and it was never on the menu again. Inconsistent."}
{"text":"A strange and welcome find - we went in for dinner and didn't know what to expect. Spitfirez shares a building with a bar, and we almost went into the wrong place, but a small sign led us in the right direction. 

We were the only patrons sitting in the restaurant, but it seemed like they do a lot of takeout orders. The guy who took our order was friendly and patiently waited while we looked over the menu. When we got our meals (2 sandwiches & some cheese fries), we were impressed. The sandwiches were incredible and even the fries appeared to be fresh-cut. The meat on my sandwich was so juicy and flavorful, I wished I would have ordered a larger option instead of the smallest. 

We will definitely be back, and next time I'll know to go big or go home!"}
{"text":"Spitfirez is the exact type of place I prefer to patronize. The smaller businesses with quality owners and workers that put out a top notch product. I think this is my 4th turkey I've gotten here. The best. Period. Gravy and stuffing are amongst the best I've ever had. First time on the spinach balls (yum!!!) and the ham. Yeah the ham. Wow!!! You simply can't go wrong here! Add in the regular menu and catering and you got one top class establishment! Keep up the excellent work Jeremy!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place with great hoagies. All the meat is slow roasted on site. Love my cheese steak hoagie. The 6 inch size was just the right amount of food. My husband had the sausage sandwich which was also very good. We lived the PITT potatoes and the side of pineapple. The prices were excellent and the portions were huge! Sad this is on the other side of town:( 

In summary we were very happy that yelp lead us here."}
{"text":"I have no idea where all the other good reviews are coming from, they couldn't have possibly eaten at the same place we did. It is very small, and very dirty. You would think they would be able to keep it clean and I am not talking about messy I am talking about caked on gross, I would never put my child in any of the boosters or high chairs. Staff seemed more concerned with having \"fun\" at work than taking care of customers. We tried to order wings but for some  reason that wasn't possible and wasn't really explained. So we both ordered burgers that were just frozen patties, the garlic parmesan fries were good if most hadn't been swimming in greese. After reading the reviews we were excited to try it, I am really at a loss as to what happened and why so many good reviews, when it was so very bad. I also am not sure if the bar attached is part of them or a different establishment.  We didn't venture into the bar since the 2 men standing in the doorway were haveing an argument."}
{"text":"Great food cooked on a spit!  Try the lamb it is great! Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when I was in a nearby location for a work class. About 10 guys from class went and it was great. Try sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"Spitfirez catered our sons first birthday party and everything turned out great! We ordered a medium sized pig with Mac and cheese and baked bean sides. The pig turned out awesome and the baked beans were incredible. Everyone enjoyed the Mac and cheese as well. I recommend Spitfirez to anyone looking for a catered bbq."}
