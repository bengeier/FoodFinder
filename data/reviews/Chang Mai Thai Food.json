{"text":"Very bland. Had Tom Ka soup, green curry, and pad thai. The soup and green curry had very little flavour. Pad thai was ok."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight, was a big let down. We ordered the pineapple curry with beef, coconut rice, spicy fried noodles with chicken, and the spring rolls. Nothing was good. The noodles and the curry dish both just tasted spicy/hot, not flavourful. The spring rolls tasted like any frozen grocery store product. Very disappointed, will not go back, and don't recommend. Also, the website states that any order over $30 if paid with cash or debit, will receive 10% off. My order came to $38 and I paid with debit, but did not receive the discount."}
{"text":"I ordered here as I was in the area and wanted to try some Thai take-out.  I found the menu quite expensive, especially $6.50 for spring rolls which I felt tasted like something from the frozen section of the local grocery store.  I ordered the Green Curry for $11.95 over coconut rice, and the taste was nothing special, had better at the shopping mall food court.  The staff that served me, most likely the owners, were very nice.  However, a take-out restaurant needs to stand on one of the following three; an inexpensive menu, large portions, or quality of the dish, and Chang Mai doesn't have any of what I mentioned."}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai places I've ever been to. I ordered the tom yum soup, pad thai and the papaya salad. For starters the tom yum soup came in a container I can't even fit my hand in, and I have pretty small hands. The pad thai was just a clump of noodles with some sauce poured over, and all the other ingredients were in a separate clump under all the noodles. Also the pad thai came with no limes like wtf I can go to thai express and get 20 limes with my pad thai but this \"Thai\" restaurant didn't even give me 1. Lastly the papaya salad tasted like it was just defrosted out of the freezer after like a year it tasted so moldy and soggy. I called in to complain because I felt that this could possibly be the biggest let down ever, like $50 for 3 dishes that tasted like garbage. Anyways the lady said I was the first one to ever complain so I went on yelp (I know I should've done this before ordering but I was so hungry and was feeling Thai food) I think I found at least 3 negative reviews quite ironic if you ask me."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice and honestly they are way over priced. They skimp out on the shrimp/meat and portions are small. They are at least charging twice as much as your average restaurant for the quantity they provide. Plus, they don't have the quality to back up the price. My advice to them is to not be so cheap and charge accordingly for the price and quantity that they provide. I didn't find their food to be tasteless but it was not amazing either."}
