{"text":"Augie's is by far the best pizza in the Chagrin area, and the best I have had anywhere in Cleveland.    Winner of the best sauce award, from 19-93 til infinity."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here for inside dining. Once again, the blackened salmon was superb. An avocado-relish thingie on top (I'm not a chef), perfectly done asparagus under, along with fingerling potatoes of just the right tenderness. Much less expensive than salmon dishes at some other restaurants--by $10--while the taste, explosion of flavors and satisfaction can't be beat. My wife had an excellent half-slab of ribs and they were really good."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Augie's...Everything from the menu to the staff to the cozy dining room!  We brought our out of town family to Augie's, for dinner.  We tried a variety of items including the Eggplant Parmigiana special to the \"everyday favorite's\" of ribs and Debbie's lasagne!  Augie's is the perfect place for a date night or a family night!  Be sure to say high to Chef Danny...he really makes you feel like family!"}
{"text":"We went to Augies with a party of 22 at 6pm on Jan. 10.  Food and service was good.  Unfortunately our evening ended with an immature emoyee  (we were informed it was owners son) turning off the TV and cable as we were all watching and waiting for the Viking Saints game to end at 8:03pm (yes they close at 8pm) as the game had 10 seconds left.  We were completely shocked and dismayed as not a word was spoken as the Cable and TV were turned off.  We clearly voiced our displeasure to which we all told by the employee \"we don't care..leave\" to each one the 22 people in our party.  Really?! Business must be great as they don't care about the people that actually fund thier payback. Absolutely  Shocking! Hopefully management can find a better way of treating the people. WE WILL NEVER BE BACK...AS WE DO CARE ABOUT BEING TREATED WITH RESPECT.  Horrible situation which was completely mismanaged."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in chagrin Falls area. We've lived here eight years and although we don't eat pizza very often we've tried them all. For a party last week, we ordered three large pizzas of different varieties and all three were excellent with lots of cheese and toppings and the crust was just perfect. We ordered one all cheese, one supreme and a third one with two toppings on one side and two toppings on the other. My buddy raved about the Italian sausage and the flavor of the cheese and I particularly liked the Banana peppers and pepperoni. My only complaint was the mushrooms they used were canned and not fresh which was the only disappointing part so if you like real mushrooms I suggest you skip them if you're ordering from here.  The delivery time was about an hour which is understandable during the Christmas holiday time so I went and picked them up in 30 minutes and they were ready right on time.  Highly recommended! We will be ordering from here monthly moving forward."}
{"text":"Good pizza but serving of lasagna and chicken parm is small for the price."}
{"text":"Augies, how I love you and miss you. My family has consistently been getting pizza from here for over 20 years. I remember driving up to the restaurant to get our takeout from here and loving the smell of the pizza filling up the car as the box sat warmly on my legs. Their pizza is nothing but great memories for me and is still to this day one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.  It isn't greasy, it isn't lazily thin, and it isn't trying to hard to be fancy or different; it just is good friggin pizza. I frequently have found that places don't know how to balance the sauce to cheese ratio well enough, but here, their double cheese pizza always has plenty of sauce to balance out the flavor and not just leave you feeling as though you just ate cheese bread.  As a kid, we rarely ate out but on occasion we'd do that up at Augies (usually it was just take out) so it was a real treat for us to go to the restaurant and sit down for food. The place isn't fancy or anything, but it is a classic place to get a pizza with the family. The juke box was always a favorite of mine too.   I recommend Augies if you aren't wanting cheapo generic food tonight, besides I think you sleep better when you support local joints anyways.  I'll be seeing you when I visit my family again, Augies. It's a date."}
{"text":"After playing miniature golf in Golf Dome, we decided to go to Augie's Pizza yesterday. And I'm so glad we did because they have great food and customer service. We ordered Aunt Tillie's salad, Eaty, Meaty pizza and spaghetti with meatballs and sausage. From the taste of the food, you can easily tell that they're using fresh ingredients. That's why the food is awesome. I can say that they have the best tasting pizza in the area. This is a neat and cute restaurant with a nice ambiance. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Augie's was a staple in my family growing up.  Occasionally we would try other pizza joints to mix it up, but we invariably ended right back with Augie's. Their pizza is amazing and it starts with the crust.  Their crust tastes like an amazing breadstick."}
{"text":"Unbelievable how they transformed an old pizza joint into an excellent restaurant.  Amazingly prices only went up a smidge.  Iwner on site, super wait staff oh and EXCELLENT PIZZA.  Take the family, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have recently updated this place and brought new life to an old pizza place. You can take the kids and get them pizza while you and your spouse get delicious salmon or veil. Go check it out, you will like it. They have a good beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"My parents live near Augie's and it is nearly tradition that on the way in from Hopkins one of us gets on the phone and orders a double cheese pizza to pick up. DELICIOUS! I HIGHLY recommend their pizza, the sauce is out of this world good. The crust is yummy and good enough to eat alone. When you order double cheese...you GET double cheese...all of the essentials if you ask me.  The dinner salad is basic but also equally yums with the house dressing all over. The reheat factor of the pie is perfecto. Seriously, this place is a gem.  The one thing I do want you to know is most people seem to order take out or delivery so the dining room is usually empty, but hey, that means more attention right? Many locals enjoy this pizza and if you ever find yourself out in the area take the time to try it out. You won't be let down!"}
{"text":"In addition to having our family's favorite local pizza, the new chef has added some really great items to the menu. I had the crab cakes with fingerling potatoes and grilled asparagus. It was wonderful! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact my family has been eating & loving augie's pizza for 40 years (use to go to the one in warrensville on emery), this location has the best employees.  We ate in for dinner on a Friday evening, 5 days later I realized I must have left my $250 pair of ray ban sunglasses there. I called and sure enough they had them!  It would have been so easy for someone to just swipe them, but the honest employees had them there waiting.   So very much appreciated!   Kudos to you all.  Looking forward to many more years of augie's pizza!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of 1 is because the cashier was friendly and the restarts appeared to be organized.  The pizza, on the other hand, was no better than any cafeteria or buffet line pizza.  I have no idea how the sauce won an award because it was pretty basic."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Augies pizza!  But,  since Danny has taken over it is by far the best pizza I have ever had!  Delicious!  Cheesy!  The crust is perfect, and that sauce...forget about it! Delivery is always on time, and the delivery person is always cordial and smiling! And, the pizza is hot when delivered!  Thank you!  I truly enjoy every single moment with my pizza!"}
{"text":"I won a gift certificate for augies in a raffle. So I thought what the heck I'll give it a try. Wow fantastic. Their pizza is so good, not greasy, sauce is so good. They don't scrimp on the toppings.   The person that took my order was so helpful and friendly. I have been back often.  Now I'm thinking about that pizza and I want some now, but its to late. Tomorrow night though guess what's for dinner. Can't wait"}
{"text":"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but my last experience with Augie's was less than stellar. we always do pizza delivery or take out. I just feel like their dough went a little downhill. Not much flavor, and there was a soggy bottom when I went to pick it up. So in the realm of a local pizza joints, I don't want to order from here."}
{"text":"Total disappointment.    We are new to the area, and this was our first pizza place we tried.  How this pizza is known as some of the best in the area is beyond me.  It was doughy, extremely greasy, and lacked any real flavor.  To quote my boyfriend, \"I've had better pizza in a school cafeteria.\"    More so than the quality, the service was awful. I ordered carry out last night and was told it would be 25-30 minutes when I called.  Almost an hour later, I finally had my pizzas.  The entire place seemingly lacked adult supervision.  The cashier mentioned they were down a server.  A party of three came in to dine-in and the cashier told them they'd have to wait until one of the parties already there was finished...there were only two parties in the entire place and all the other tables were empty.  Needless to say, the puzzled patrons just walked out.  Management should probably provide better oversight of the young staff.  They were unprofessional in speaking with one another in front of patrons and unprofessional in dealing with customers.  Unfortunately, we will not be back."}
{"text":"I am giving Augie's a solid 4 star review.  Ordered pizza and breadsticks before a Browns game to enjoy eating during the game.  5 minutes from my house so location couldn't be better.  My husband picked up the pizza and was impressed with the rotisserie style pizza oven."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've ever eaten. We now live in the Philadelphia area and cannot find a match."}
{"text":"Baby Back Ribs are one of Cleveland's best kept secrets!  Meat lovers pizza is the best pizza on the east side and don't miss the house salad with house dressing!"}
{"text":"Perfectly crisped crust, just the right amount of bite. Sauce is tangy. Went for a sausage, mushroom and artichoke heart -- hearty helpings of each ingredient.  Service for dine-in was slow, but the folks behind the counter were friendly. And they offer a pre-baked -- needs 10-15 minutes at 375 to finish, and it ends up just as good as fresh at the dine-in."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had the Walleye special tonight.  It was excellent with a light but crispy coating.  I was able to substitute crisp and tender asparagus for the French Fries. The peach crisp was a great ending for the meal. We will be back next weekend for the special again!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating here and it is amazing! Best family special for takeout, great salads and house dressing, amazing dough and sauce. I even love the square cut. I live in the south now but have to eat this several times when I come home to visit."}
{"text":"This pizza is always a solid bet! Good sauce and nice crust.  Hey, be sure to try their house vinaigrette salad  dressing! It is the bomb and is also great to dip your pie into!!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience last time and were not going to come back, but today we were hungry and nearby and their Pizza is really, really good so we went back. Our food came out on time this time and was excellent. As we were waiting for the bill our server told us Danny had covered it make up for our experience last time. I thanked him on our way out and he was very gracious. That's good customer service right there, and with how great the food is, we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great service and a great meatball sandwich today with a takeout. First time here. I'll be back!"}
