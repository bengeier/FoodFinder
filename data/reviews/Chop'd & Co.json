{"text":"This place offers really fresh and tasty salads. If you're looking for a healthy option, this should be on your radar. The only thing is the price. One salad is usually around $20...those add ons!! It's definitely worth it though and you probably could save 1/2 for later considering they give you a little piece of bread to go with."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for myself (and my bank account) this place is my new obsession. As someone who thoroughly enjoys salads, it's pretty bomb. Though it is quite pricey, especially if you build your own and start piling on the add-ons (which really do add up quickly), but I do believe you get what you pay for, because the ingredients taste really fresh and high quality. Also, I find that they don't cheap you out of ingredients, because these salads are quite big and they are surprisingly generous with the ingredients (at least in my experience). A really nice spot if you're downtown/on McGill campus and want something fresh for lunch!

I knock off one star for the slightly steep pricing, and also for the fact that the register staff are not very friendly (oops)."}
{"text":"I have been passing near this new restaurant for a while and wanted to try it as I was wondering what would be so different from this place compared to the other ones in the area i.e. Mandy's or Laitue&Go. Hum... The place is very well kept, it is clean and has a nice modern design. I ordered through their machine in the entrance which is very user-friendly but you can also order from the counter. I had a salmon salad as well as a mango smoothie ($17.75). You can feel that the ingredients are fresh (which is a plus) but it just doesn't taste as good as what you would expect when you pay that price for a salad.... I definitely had better salmon salad ....And unfortunately, it's the same for the smoothie... 

Conclusion: I haven't been able to figure out what differentiates them from their competitors apart from the fact that the restaurant is very well decorated. so If you like eating in nice spots and don't mind paying extra bucks for not so original salads this place is definitely for you."}

{"text":"I give it a 2 cos my salad was pretty big and nice.... But the service is outrageous.
At your arrival, the cashier lady looks like that she is on some kind of death sentence. She won't look at you, smile or even talk in this matter (other than asking you for the price). 17$ for a salad. Ok I will let that pass as it is supposed to be local and fresh.
All the staff look angry, pissed and feel like that they are going to murder you when they chop your salad. Then your number is called and they missed my tuna and the aromatic herbs..... 17$ guys... Come on!!
Then I try to enjoy my salad when some staff start swearing out loud the F*** word and trash some stuff on the floor.
Then an other guy yells the number of other customers salad and begins being pissed if the customer don't show up fast enough.
Oh well..... My first and last time. I'm a pretty easy going person but I was shocked today at this place."}
{"text":"A friend had a few $5.00 vouchers to Chop'd & Co, so we decided to give it a go for lunch one day. In all honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. 

The place itself was very nice and clean, so I'll give them that. It's also in an ideal location - right by the McGill campus - which is convenient if you want to grab a quick lunch. It's similar to Mandy's in the sense that there are a few salads on the menu, or you can create your own. The ordering process is a bit disorganized and essentially results in a bunch of people waiting at the end of the counter for their order number to be called. I also want to mention that it's extremely overpriced. My salad cost over $18.00 before the $5.00 discount, and it was just lettuce and veggies. I'd also like to add that a few things I ordered weren't even put in my salad, even though I was charged for them. 

The salad itself was good, but nothing extraordinary. I would recommend trying this place out if you have a coupon of some sort, but it's not exactly worth the price if you don't."}
