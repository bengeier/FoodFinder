{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place to go to. The chicken pho and steak pho is the best i have ever had ever, and they also have a coconut jello for dessert, made with coconut water it is the best jello i have ever had."}
{"text":"Really nice experience here. We were on our way to Phoenix pho but they happened to be closed. I yelped for other pho places near my area, and came across this place. Which I was really surprised by the good reviews. We happened to be the only one there that time but the owner greeted us and was really nice and attentive to our dinning there. Overall really good pho and we also had stir fry rice noodles with shrimp freshly made and delicious!! Was super hungry forgot to take pics"}
{"text":"Delicious pho and friendly nice people. This will be my new go to for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"First visit. We had the Pho beef and #23, good quality, fresh, and delicious. Fair very reasonable prices. Nice place, clean. Owners U & K, very nice people. Making this our first goto place for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming back. Great food!! The owners are a cute older couple !! Super sweet !!! I will definitely continue to come back to support them!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to stop by because she wanted some Pho at around 8:45pm. We stopped by and were greeted with open arms even thought it was getting close to closing time. The owner was very genuine and personalized our experience. We would honestly come back just because of the service. The food was really good as well. My gf had pho and I had orange chicken. We were both completely satisfied and had great conversation with the owner. 5 stars. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I found this place through my sister and must I say i was a little skeptical because I'm very picky especially when it comes to the broth for my pho . Might I say i was highly impressed! The service is always amazing! They make you feel comfortable and makes you want to revisit them time and time again . I've tried the chicken pho and the noodles were cooked perfectly and very flavorful ! I also ordered the orange chicken the last two times I came and I always need a to-go plate because they give you such a good amount that I can't finish . Haha . It's a good thing though, you get your money's worth . The spring rolls always taste freshly made which is a definite plus . Tables are always clean and the restrooms as well . It's an A + all the way around , I don't understand how they're not packed!? (hence why I'm writing so more people can know about this wonderful place) one more thing , every time my sister goes , they know her order . I loved that . And the last time I came he knew what we like to order as well :) That right there made me want to write this review! Keep up the awesome job"}
{"text":"We have found a new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix. It's on 43 Ave north of Bethany Home. I had the rib eye steak with lemongrass vermicelli bon bowl. To die for! Excellent spring rolls AND fried egg rolls (had to try both!) And yes, the wonder is friendly and genuine and really, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, owners are charming, kind and very helpful.  We had pho and spring rolls, both of which were superb!"}
{"text":"Best Bahn Mi of my entire life. Really! Pork sweet and savory and perfect. The bread - wow- soft and crunchy in the right places. Dressing, cilantro, carrots, and fresh/crispy cucumbers were a great flavor addition.  I also ordered the shrimp spring rolls, but let's be honest, $4.50 for the best sandwich ever is the thing to order. On a cooler day,  based on reviews, I would have tried the pho. Just coming through town but if I ever come back this way, I'll be back to this unassuming restaurant. Yum!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a mom and pop joint in a strip mall, but the food speaks highly for itself. The Bahn Mi (with two pork options,  shredded or grilled) is a terrific deal at $3.50. The Pho is rich, deep, and home-made with love. Finally, for those who like their panda express, one of the co-owners helped pioneer orange chicken long ago, and used to sell over a hundred orders a day at an old restaurant he worked at (or so I overheard). In any event, this place is worth your time."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall is easily ignored (in a little strip mall tucked in between a Mexican restaurant and a pawn shop), but it should definitely not be!  It's only been open for 4 months and it's a great find!  The owner recommended spring rolls, Pho, and Orange Chicken, so we went with it.  Everything was delicious and very inexpensive!  The service was great and very friendly.  You could tell that the owner takes huge pride in providing an authentic, delicious meal experience, one which we enjoyed immensely."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I have ever had. The broth was very flavorful, all of the vegetables were very fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The potstickers and Spring roll were spectacular as appetizers. The owner personally waited on us and was incredibly friendly. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"My new favorite pho restaurant I swear , the owners are so nice! And the beef pho was so delicious! I also got a mango boba tht was to die for  and the prices were so good! Haven't had a positive experience like this in a while , definitely be coming back again very soon."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. This is a great place to get some good pho. They have big servings at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks back and everything was delish. My 6 year old had their orange chicken with rice and he loved it. We had Pho and Spring egg rolls and you cant go wrong with the food here, everything tasted very good and authentic."}
{"text":"Great service - very attentive and anticipate your needs even before you ask. Food was good as well. Don't be scared of the neighborhood it's located in, the owners are really nice and the food is authentic. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Very kind and helpful owners! The menu was simple and easy to work with. I enjoyed the owner's company and I'm happy to support a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"First time try. Happy to say it is right here in the neighborhood. The food is excellent and the we like the prices. Owners and others are very friendly. We order #3, #12 (Beef Pho), and the grilled pork Bon Mi. All very good, very tasty, the flavors I like and condiments, veggies very fresh. Casual place, long in the tooth but very acceptable. I'd turn off the kid TV programming  and play some music or nothing at all but I'm a newcomer and not the only one to make happy. :-) 

Sorry no food pic, just a full Bill. Enough said."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I have tried other Pho in California and this one is comparably good. The service is friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Amazing pho place!!! The area is a little disheartening at first but the food is absolutely amazing, and some of the better priced pho I've had! Easily a PHX favorite and so cute inside. The spring rolls were also delicious!"}
{"text":"Another trip to Phoenix, another Pho restaurant.   I was having a craving for Pho and I found this establishment on Yelp.  It's not in the greatest of neighborhoods, but they had some excellent ratings, so I drove over to this establishment that evening.

I got there around 7p and there was one other customer in the place and the restaurant looked old.  I was greeted and served by the owner and he was very cheerful and talkative. The menu was easy to navigate with English translations (but I still couldn't find and missed my standard Chicken Pho).  I ordered the Pho Xe L'ua, which is a mixture of textures of beef and it was delicious!  I haven't eaten beef in a couple of years, but this was worth it.  The prices are SO REASONABLE and the service was top notch.  I will be returning to this establishment the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm no Pho expert, actually first time having it and it really was delicious.....owner very friendly, he seems to push his orange chicken so my wife ordered it and LOVED it......I tried a few pieces and it is very good, has a crunch texture and the sauce was nice and came with sticky rice.   As for my Pho, all the herbs were very fresh and the broth was very flavorful.   Owner mentioned he worked at a restaurant for years at or near the Biltmore.   Also noticed they are very flexible with the menu as far as adding or removing hot spices.   I'm going back again for sure, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The owners are very nice. We walked in, told them we wanted takeout. We walked up to the counter when the owner said to have a seat and take our time until we were ready. As we looked at the menu, he brought us water. Very sweet. We placed our order and then my niece wanted their shakes and asked if we could pick two flavors and mix. They never have done that but said they could. It was delicious, made fresh. The Pho we ordered was delicious and recommend this place."}
{"text":"This pho was pho kinh amazing! Also the owner made sure to let me know that 'there is no word kinh' since that was written on my shirt. Extremely friendly owners, husband and wife, very delicious food, inexpensive, and I'll be back pho sure! Should have ordered more than one order of eggrolls. I know for next time! Also they are now open on Mondays! At least that's when I went to eat here, so please support this little local restaurant! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place out on our way to Sands Chevrolet because of all the positive Yelp reviews and man were we glad we did. This is the perfect Vietnamese restaurant. Totally unassuming on the outside and very modest on the inside but I'm not here for the decor or ambiance. I'm here for the food! We had the traditional spring rolls, beef pho, and bo kho (Vietnamese beef stew). Everything, I mean everything, was super fresh and delicious. The pho broth was some of the best I've ever had. It wasn't too sweet or watered down. Amazing depth of flavor. I would eat here 4 or 5 times a week if it was closer. Please support this mom and pop shop. They are doing Vietnamese food justice."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stumbled into this hidden gem on New Year's Eve, we were driving around craving Phó and I'm so happy we stopped by. The owner is super nice and friendly, very humble kind man, I was extremely pleased with their service. I loved  this place, they're very welcoming and I feel right at home...they treat you like family. We normally go eat pho to one that's closer to home but since I came here the first time, I'd rather drive an extra few miles just because I love their food, customer service and it's authentic Vietnamese food. Btw...the U.K doesn't stand for United Kingdom, it's the husband and wife initials and the owner told me to let everyone know that.. he's such a sweet man, I really love this place! So if your ever in this area please don't hesitate to give it a try because it's delicious, we always get the pho and it's soooo  darn good. I also tried the egg rolls and they're one of the best I've ever tried...I'm in love with this place, I need to come more often, the owner even taught me how to pronounce what I was ordering!!! Thank you Mr Khai and Ungh"}
{"text":"One big advantage of using the yelp app is being able to find hidden gems like this, tucked in a small nondescript commercial strip that doesn't attract much attention. My friend and fellow yelper John  M. and I were warmly welcomed and immediately seated, and I ordered the dishes that I use as benchmark for assessing a Vietnamese eatery: pho dac biet and banh xeo. The pho broth was very flavorful but more importantly the meats were really fresh-tasting. For me, that is a big plus; meats (especially cooked meats or meat preparations like meatballs) that have a previously-frozen flavor are not uncommon in the pho that you find in many Vietnamese restaurants, but that is definitely not the case here. The banh xeo was excellent; the rice-turmeric crepe was crispy and the fillings were generous. Because we also ordered spring rolls (really good!), the meal turned out to be heavier than we had anticipated ... but we're definitely not sorry!"}
{"text":"Super friendly. I asked if their boba had any milk and they right away offered to substitute it with coconut milk. My Taro Boba tea came out awesome. The guy who served us remembered us from the first time we went there a few months ago. Our food was served promptly both times and was very tasty. We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"UK still gets 5 stars and my honest review stands. However they gone through some changes. They have removed some items and increased the prices on others by $1. Apps are now $5 instead of $4 for egg rolls and spring rolls. However they have a full vegetarian menu now.

**********
I have  to do an update.
UK has become my favorite restaurant. I go here 2-3 times per week. Be sit down or take out its always a pleasure to eat this food.

I have tried so many Pho places and sadly I always compare them to UK and their Pho is just not as good as UKs. 

All the dishes I've tried are amazing and never dissapoint. From their soups, rice, vermicelli, appetizers and even boba drinks. Its all good.

The owner Khai and Ungh make this place even more special. Since we frequent this place so much Khai always goes the extra distance to add additional things to our food, make any changes we need to accommodate our diet and he's always happy. Truly a place that i feel like im at home. 

Seriously try it you wont be dissapointed.

*************
Its true what other reviews say, the owner is a super nice older man. Right from the start as i entered restaurant for a to go order he couldn't be more attentive. I told him how i had gotten one of their menus in my driveway and he was so excited to tell me he was the one distributing them. Lol

Note - he urged me to try the orange chicken; \"trust me its do good.\" However i was set on Pho and egg rolls(staples of a Vietnamese restaurant). He said he worked at Bamboo Club and made it there. So im sure its delish and my #1 option for next time.

Food: 
egg rolls - fresh, crispy and full of flavor. Props for actually giving one lettuce leaf for each piece. Dipping sauce was actually well balanced and not too overly fishy like other places.
Pho - #7, regular size everything beef pho. So comforting and delicious. I like that the broth is not too sweet. Many other pho places tend to make their Pho too sweet. All the meat was tasty and an added bonus is that they put meatballs, other places its extra. 

I will most definitely be back. I like that its a mom and pop shop, inviting and such sweet owner. 

Ps - the have bobba :-)"}
{"text":"Great Pho and boba smoothies. Owner was super friendly. Quick service. We ordered the beef Pho. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Delicious Pho & Spring Rolls!!! The veggies were extremely fresh & yummy! Family run & owned...great service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to. Reasonable price, AMAZINGLY FRESH FOOD, and fairly new restaurant. Spring rolls were fresh and good and the sauce wasn't cheap at all. Very nice and kind owner. I really can't find a reason not to come back. I never write reviews unless I wanna give 1 star but I really love this place!!"}
{"text":"Delish!  Great selection of vegetarian/vegan dishes!!! Everything we had was absolutely the best Vietnamese food anywhere! Our new favorite, we will be back often!"}
{"text":"This is a nice diamond in the rough the food is great with a great price this was my first time here it will definitely come back again I don't judge places by their surroundings I'm glad I went in side"}
{"text":"U.K Pho is absolutely amazing! It's smalll and tucked in a little shopping center. If you see it, STOP AND EAT THERE!. Definitely will be going back!. Even my kids loves it."}
{"text":"Great new pho place! Best pho I've had in Glendale. Will definitely be going back. Quick service, very friendly. I heard the orange chicken is really good too so I'll be trying that next time."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are from California where there is a huge Vietnamese population. We've been living in Arizona for two years now and this is definitely the best pho place in Arizona. Will be coming back soon. The place is very clean and the owners are very hardworking and kind people."}
{"text":"First off, I never leave reviews but this place is so special, I had to. My boyfriend and I picked UK pho simply because we were driving by. We're not adventurous people but we went for it. Absolutely no regrets! The food was exceptional, the service was even better. Yummy, authentic Vietnamese food. We ordered spring rolls and pho tai. We both agreed it was the best we have ever had. Also, they sell boba which was delicious as well. I asked for a Taro snow with boba which I loved and my boyfriend ordered the almond flavor. Too good! The owners are so sweet, attentive and friendly. They tend to you personally and go above and beyond. Without a doubt, we will continue coming here. If you're looking for great food, service, and prices, please go here! Tell your friends!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Had spring rolls, pho, and Saigon crepe. All excellent and fresh. Service was great. Definitely a great local hole in the wall gem. Don't let exterior and strip mall fool you."}
{"text":"This one of those places that is recognized as the true hole in a wall grub spot. The people that owns the places are such nice people. They will greet you with a smile and ask you how you are doing. Such a friendly environment. The food is phenomenal. Don't let the location fool you. The food here is great. Real authentic Vietnamese food and made fresh to order. Simple but definitely a restaurant you must try when in search for a place to each. Pho and rice plates are on point and the best part is that it is very easy on the wallet and filling. Also they close at 9. Try it and you'll come back."}
{"text":"The best pho and spring rolls ever. I tried different places and this far from the best"}
{"text":"Best place great service !!! Such nice employees as well. Highly recommended!  And also very affordable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with co-workers today- the little place was awesome! The lemongrass chicken was very fresh and delicious. The beef and chicken phos also got two thumbs up. But the best thing was the sweet older man who seated us and took our order. He was so helpful and friendly! He really wanted us to try the orange chicken (he said it's the best around!) but I had my heart set on lemongrass. But we will be sure to try it next time!"}
{"text":"Pretty odd location for Pho.
I was there and maybe that's the reason. 
Nobody goes to Glendale to eat Pho...they go to Glendale to you know... hehe
But good news is the Pho is good. Really good. 
I like the broth. the owner is nice. 
this looks like mother and father holes in the brick wall kinda place you know. I wish there were lots of people there when i eat Pho because it was creepy as fock. I like to be around people because most of the time i'm lonely. but the good news is the springrolls were very tightly wrapped. order some and you will know what i mean."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is rated so high.  The price is good is the only reason it's not getting 1 star.  The pho was below average for Phoenix standards, but what is disgusting is the cleanliness of the place.  The men's bathroom is beyond gross.  The light switch is black with dirt.  The spoon for the garlic pepper sauce and lid was also gross.  No thank you."}
{"text":"This place is way better than pho 43. Their are very friendly and will refill your cups. They make you feel welcome. Will not get my pho any where else, but here. Plus affordable"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Seriously the best pho in town!! I won't go anywhere else. The owner takes great care of us every time we go in. Our other favorites are the #30 a veggie, shrimp and pork stir fry with steamed rice and the orange chicken!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Trusted yelp and was not disappointed. Owners are attentive and \"have a dream\"."}
{"text":"Oh my word! BEST PHO EVER !  I walked in and it was empty so I was a bit hesitant at first so glad we went in. It's a nice family owned location the people are so nice. I had Boba smoothie, and had the beef Pho, I couldn't stop eating. We decided to order a few other things and honestly we couldn't stop ordering. We were stuffed yet could not stop eating. I will be coming back to this location soon! Some of the best !"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here and I will certainly return. Broth for the pho was very good, I don't use any additional sauces so I find the base flavor very important. My #1 spring rolls were just the right size and the peanut sauce was just as I like it, not that brown runny stuff but actually looked like it was made from peanuts."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I ordered their #9. The broth is full of flavor, it's a large portion size, and the customer service was great. I will be returning here frequently. I'm so happy I finally came across a place that makes tasty Pho."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall Pho restaurant was delightfully personal and full of vegetarian options! They have two full pages dedicated to vegetarian meals. When I ordered the vegetable Pho dish, the owner asked if I was a vegetarian and proceeded to tell me about his wife who was also a vegetarian. He was incredibly sweet and warm. He even gave us free yogurt after we paid the bill!"}
{"text":"Mom & Pop shop with delicious Pho. Great service. If you make it out make sure to try the orange chicken as well as the potstickers. I used to go to another pho place but since discovering this place it's my go to spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic find! Turned away from another establishment nearby that didn't have vegetarian options only to find the best summer rolls I've ever had! Peanut sauce is fantastic. Veggie pho was good, had a nice variety of vegetables and generous portions for the price. It is definitely a hole in the wall, but the husband and wife (who is vegetarian for more than 30 years) team were very friendly and kind. Looking forward to seeing their business succeed and to eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle which has a ton of pho restaurants so trust me when I say this place is Really good. The pho tasted clean and was full of flavor."}
{"text":"I wanted to be excited for this place, but the food was mediocre, the service worse, and ugh - Fox \"News\" was inflicted on us."}
{"text":"I Have never met such nice owners in my life . He asked us for opinions of how the food we ordered ? We told him his food was awesome n he even brought up us 4 free Vietnamese yogurt fir us to try . I was so happy , haven't had them since I left VN since I was 14 n OMG they were so yummy . Thank you for ur awesome service .  I even bought some to take home and he went out the way to put them on the ice for us . 
Too bad we had to leave AZ to go back to Oregon but this is the place I will come back to when I m in town again . You guys keep up the good work n excellent customer service your business will succeed .
The marshes"}
{"text":"Best pho we've had in a long time, plus be sure to order a little cup of vietnamese yogurt.. Yum!  I also recommend the veggie rolls with their housemade peanut sauce. We met the owners and they were very nice people, I recommend paying a visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First timer - ended up here by accident as the place we usually go to down the road was closed when we arrived.  GLAD IT WAS CLOSED! This place is delicious..we started with an order of potstickers which were exceptional. Main course was a bowl of Pho and the Grilled Pork Vermicelli - both DELICIOUS.  Thai Tea Boba was also excellent and the owner was especially friendly and accommodating. PHOnomenal!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They got amazing pho full of flavor the best I've had in Phoenix it's a good price for a good filling serving. Their spring rolls are the best I've had. Fresh and amazing peanut sauce all for a good price. I was recommended by a friend and have since then have been going there as my first choice, very friendly service(unlike other Vietnamese restaurants). It's a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"We'd heard about this place through Yelp, and decided to give it a try.  It's in a strip mall, and is a little hard to find.  But, once you do, it's really delicious!  The owner took our order, and is really nice.  

We started with spring rolls, which were so fresh and light.  They were served with a really good peanut sauce...yummy!!

Hubby got pho, and loved it.  It's served in a huge bowl, and he ended up finishing the whole thing.  The broth was so rich with flavor, and the herbs were fresh.  In other reviews, as well as when we were there, the owner commented on his orange chicken.  I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did.  It's served with a side bowl of sticky rice and broccoli.  The chicken was wonderful, it was crunchy, but still tender.  The sauce was amazing!  I ended up putting my extra rice in my extra sauce and finished it all up.  If I could have, I would've licked the bottom of the plate.

All in all, we will definitely be going there again.  Delicious and friendly are a great combination!"}
{"text":"They're the only pho place open past 8:30  very accommodating and polite workers ! Will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"We love Pho and like to try new places.  UK was recommended on Yelp and I'm so glad we went. They are located in a small red roof plaza on the west side of 43rd ave , just north of Bethany. We arrived just as it opened on a Sunday and were greeted by a very friendly and helpful gentleman.  Inside was clean, nice and cool. The menu selection is smaller than most pho restaurants we have been to, but so were the prices, so score. We were not disappointed at all.  Omg, when my pho arrived it smelled delicious. The broth was sooo good. I added the fixings and some spice and it was probably the best pho that I have had! Not greasy or bland. My parents called as we were finishing up, I told them how good it was and they were there in 10 min. They liked it just as much as we did. We will definitely be back for more soon, especially since I just realized they have salty fish rice. How did I miss that?"}
{"text":"Waking up & being able to get pho @9:30 in the morning is already a win because most places don't open till 11ish. I had a bowl of pho dac biet & it was yummy! Big loaded bowl full of flavor! I will most definitely be a regular"}
{"text":"Just like everyone says great food and great service. I've been to several Vietnamese restaurants and the number one thing they are terrible at is customer service but these owners are great"}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp, man the price is great and the amount of food you get is totally worth it. I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Owner and staff made me feel welcome as a new patron, and made excellent recommendations.  Will be back, soon!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Pho. Owner is very nice and makes sure your dining experience is pleasant. I recommend this establishment for Pho."}
{"text":"Best best best pho, their Pho reminded me so much of viet nam, from the taste of the broth to the scent. Their pot sticker was good as well, it was different than what I had expected, it was more on the crunchy side then the soft oily looking kind, which I love. And their banh xeo, my mom would never have to spend hours in the kitchen for me anymore, we can just come here from now on. Their taro boba is also a must try. 
Omg why have I waited so long to come here? 
Oh btw, there's a little free treats at the end of the meal, I won't say what it is, must find out yourself ."}
{"text":"The best little Pho place. The service is great, you don't feel rushed or ignored. My favorite has been the spring rolls with the peanut sauce they are delicious ! They have a beef stew with rice noodles that is amazing and even though it is not on the menu they are happy to make it upon request."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the reviews online. This place is outstanding! It's a little far from where I live but definitely worth the drive. For lunch I ordered the beef brisket Pho and a Banh Mi. I ate my whole meal. Everything is so fresh and tasty, from the peanut sauce to the Pho. This place has generous portions at an amazing price. The owner and his wife are super nice and welcoming. Needless to say I will definitely be returning soon and bringing all of my friends."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a GREAT value.  Had the beef pho, spring rolls, chicken and shrimp stir fry and house fried rice.  Everything was fresh and tasted great.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"First experience with pho, was very pleased. From the outside, it's definitely a little questionable and you are not sure what to expect, but the food was good and the staff was quick and friendly. I had the vegetarian pho and couldn't get anywhere near to finishing the bowl, there is plenty of food and it's fairly cheap. Everything on the menu is conveniently labeled with letters or numbers so you don't look like a fool when you have to try and pronounce the names of the dishes. Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"My new go to place for Pho. My family and I were really craving Pho and we went in 30 mins before closing time. We had potstickers, egg rolls, bahn mi, and Pho and they were all delicious along with great prices. The owners Uoc and Khai were soooooo lovely too. When it was closing time they didn't even rush us out but instead they gave us some of their yummy yogurt. They have amazing food along with amazing customer service."}
{"text":"So I woke up craving pho and the place by my house is closed on Tuesday of all days. So I hop on yelp to find another spot and U.K Egroll had the highest rating so I thought I'd see for myself if it was any good. Well I was blown  out of the water it was so much better than the place I go by my house. The food was nice and hot and it came quickly unlike some other places where you wait 30 minutes for some eggrolls and pho. It was clean which is a big part of the 5 star rating. Customer service is 100 times better and turns out the owner used to work at the same pho place by my house but he decided to open his own resturant after 20 years of working in other peoples kitchens, and I'd like to thank him for that. Its been open for less than a year but it will be a staple in the neighborhood for years to come, don't let the strip mall fool you,  this is some of the best Vietnamese food in town! Give it a try"}
{"text":"Orange chicken is good. The rice is pretty good. Pork egg roll with garlic dipping sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing prices. 

We had two bowls of Pho, a Banh Mi, and two orders of spring rolls for less than $25. 

Telling all my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in strip mall , food was very fresh and good.  Old guy who is the owner is super friendly, they have only been open 5 months , come out and try you won't be disappointed!  We will be back"}
{"text":"I tried this joint based on the reviews alone. If you check my history, you'll see I don't give out five stars often - but this place earned it. 

The couple that owns this restaurant, Mr. and Mrs. Lee, are very kind and appreciative of their customers' business. They greeted me as soon as I walked in and Mr. Lee was very helpful with his suggestions, even though I already knew what I wanted. The menu was easy to read and the prices were reasonable.

The Food: Terrific. The spring rolls had large, perfectly cooked shrimp and pork that was savory. Mint was very aromatic and the helping of peanut sauce was huge and delicious. The pho had flavorful broth (not a given at every pho place around town), fresh condiments for mixing in, and the sliced steak was actually served rare. The meatballs were tasty and contained no gristle. The soup was served warm, but not so scaldingly hot I couldn't eat it right away.

The service was great and I'm pleased to say that the Yelpers who've reviewed this place prior to me have been spot on. The only puzzling thing to me is why this place was relatively empty whereas other Vietnamese places in town with food not quite as good are packed. Bottom line, if you get a chance, GO. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok so many placing 5 stars! So I was there in an un assuming strip mall. I am there for the food. We are three hungry peoples and yes is Vietnamese food all right given 2 of us been to Vietnam. The place is run by a men and a women the food I have to say home cooking. As god as their are I had better in Westminster Los Angeles so with all fairness I would give 5 stars if I never been out of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is classic yelp.  Chances of finding this place on my own: 0%. Chances of it  becoming a regular Go To: 100%. We love the egg roll, potstickers, and fried rice. The vegetarian bowl was delicious. All of it approach \"best ever\" but the best part are the friendly proprietors, K and U."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho I've had in AZ. And I've been to a lot. We ordered spring rolls and their peanut sauce was incredible.  I had pho dac biet,  my hubby had pho tai. The broth was delicious and flavorful.  I didn't want to ruin it by adding lime juice,  hoisin sauce and sriracha (when at other places I tend to add a lot of it to give it some semblance of flavor). I was happy with how much meat they gave you and the bowls were big!! I recommend you at least try it, but maybe during the day bc the area is sketchy. Lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  We came here for my birthday.  Not for the ambiance but for the food.  We ordered things that were on the menu, and off the menu, like the crispy wings which were fantastic.  The Pho was terrific and very flavorful. The broth was really great.  We got the Vietnamese Crepe, it was outstanding.  My 7 yr old Grandson loved the orange chicken and he is very picky.  My son loved the pork chop with rice and the fried eggs.  My daughter liked the vermicelli, pork and Eggroll Bowl.  The food is fantastic and reasonably priced.  The ambiance needs some help.  We will definitely be back for the food.  If you like Pho, this is the best place in the valley we have found so far, and we have tried over 20 pho restaurants across Maricopa County."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place next time I'm in Glendale area , with a party of 4 & everyone loved their dish.

Prices are very reasonable, I was surprised how empty the place was when we arrived.  

For the asians, they use very high quality  viet/thai long grain Jasmine  rice here."}
{"text":"Great food.  Excellent service!  The owner is friendly and UK stands for his and his wife's initials.  He wanted me to share that!"}
{"text":"A trip to Glendale Glitters a while back led us to UK. Just a great meal and value. Long talk with the owner just added to the experience. Not in that part of town too often, but will go back any time."}
{"text":"I found this little gem right here on Yelp! It is close to home and I hoped that it would be decent. Man! I am not disappointed at all! 

I got an order of Chicken Pho. Broth tastes amazing. Noodles perfectly cooked. Chicken, no joke, the most tender pho chicken I have ever had! I also ordered an order of three egg rolls. They smelled so good that I ate one in the car. 

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, you can order \"to go\" since they don't have delivery. I asked a few questions about the location and it turns out not only are they super friendly, but it's owned by a family! 

So from my family to their's, thanks for filling my empty belly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff seated me promptly and gave me the biggest bowl of shrimp pho I ever had. Enough for two meals. I sat where I wanted and ate comfortably. I highly recommend this place for a quick large bowl of pho."}
{"text":"My dad and I get pho almost once a week, so it's safe to say we love pho! We had been going to a place off of 17th Ave and Camelback for a while until we found this place. It is hands down the best pho we have had!! We typically stick to chicken, but the food is so good here that we had to try the beef pho... did not disappoint!!! The owner and his wife run the restaurant and they are the kindest people I have ever known. I have never taken the time to write a review, but this place has my heart. I probably won't write a review for another restaurant either... but I will continue to write reviews for this place. The food is amazing and so are the people! Take the time to check this place out, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Good Pho, very reasonable prices, very nice owner. Had the Pho Tai. If I lived closer this would be a weekly stop."}
{"text":"The folks here are so nice. Wow! The food was very good. A very nice experience. Well priced too."}
{"text":"This place is really clean, the owner is super friendly, the special order of pho I ordered came quickly and was delicious. I also recommend their spring rolls too, it was a nice double of the portion I didn't expect so you actually get more.
The pho broth wasn't too greasy or salty so I was really enjoying the flavor and can tell they used bone marrow to cook for long hours to get that flavor. Overall this was a pleasant experience and i highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  My son said it was the best grilled pork chop he has ever had and the pho was great and the prices were reasonable."}
