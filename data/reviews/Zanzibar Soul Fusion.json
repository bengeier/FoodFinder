{"text":"Many good things to say about Zanzibar. My exposure to their entire menu is limited, but what I had was delicious. You have to get the walleye cakes! Their chicken and cornbread is also very good. The kool-aid is overpriced but it is delicious.  The waitstaff was professional and the atmosphere is very relaxed.  Price tag is pretty good considering the amount and quality of the food you get.  My only complaint is the speed of service, but I haven't been there enough times to really deduct points because of it (may have been isolated incidences).  edit: I've been a few more times, and the speed or service hasn't really changed. They dining room temperature is also a little too toasty for my liking. Food is still delicious, though."}
{"text":"I love the food! Especially the whole fried chicken wings! Our server, Cee Cee was amazing! I ordered late but she made sure that my food came out the same time as my friends'! She was also very bubbly and very patient while waiting for me to make an order cuz there was a lot to choose from!;-) Amazing place and service!;-)"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some chicken and waffles, so we found this place.  We were way under-dressed.  This is a pretty classy place - looks like a lot of special occasions were being celebrated, and we felt a little too casual in our flip flops and jeans - but they were still nice to us.    They do take reservations, I'd recommend it - not because they were especially full at 5:30PM on a Saturday - but because the hostess asked us if we had any (even at that time) and it looked like they might seat people without reservations in the bar area at high tops (we were seated in the dining area because someone was late for their reservation).   We had the catfish fries for an appetizer - well cooked, not greasy and surprising light for being deep fried.  Only complaint was that there were a few \"fishy\" pieces in the mix, but not sure if that's the nature of catfish (avoid the darker pieces if so).  The chicken and waffles were ok, the pieces of chicken were a little too well done and smallish, the waffles were mini waffles - nice presentation.  But after having this dish here - I'm inspired to just make belgian waffles on my waffle maker, add a little cinnamon to the mix and pair it with some Popeyes chicken and Tabasco sauce - and save my stomach for other dishes on their menu.  The real highlight of our dinner was the smothered steak ... OMG ... so good - we had the gravy on the side so it didn't mask the flavor of the steak.  The potatoes were really good (a rich au gratin style), we had the collared greens (ok - but on the bitter side, recommend trying something else), and buttered grits (yummy - great to balance out all the other salty food we had).  Everyone else's dishes in the restaurant looked really good too ... I'll probably check out the other Yelper's recommendations to see what to try next."}
{"text":"We stop for brunch. Had chicken and waffles, Quiche Louisiana. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Waffles were red velvet. Quiche had the perfect amount of spice. Tried the gator sausage. Yummy! Definitely will be back to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I had the Soul Rolls, which were amazing, but the problem was how long it took to just get that! It was the only thing I ordered, and it took over an hour to come out from the kitchen. My friends and I all had to sit at the bar, as the staff claimed there were no tables available (the bartender then told us there were plenty of tables available and were not reserved). Then the bartender kept messing up who ordered drinks. I only had one beer, and he tried to charge me for three. When I pointed this out, he began to argue with me! I'm pretty sure I know what I ordered! He was charging me for two additional that my friend had. Overall, the food was good, but I will never go back. I love soul food and am all for fusion foods, but the service is absolutely horrible! They were out of a lot of menu items for it only being 5pm on a Friday, and the food took way too long. And forget trying to get someone's attention once your food actually arrives."}
{"text":"This restaurant hasn't even been open three weeks and it's hitting on all cylinders. Super friendly wait staff and very reasonable prices. My wife and I ordered the red fish tacos to start and I found the tacos to be the right balance between fish and slaw/cilantro. I was craving some fried chicken and it did not disappoint. My wife ordered the blackened catfish and it was fabulous. A fantastic addition to downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place wanted to charge a $10 cake fee for an 86 year old's birthday and refused to waive the fee, they said that the manager should have told us this when the reservation was made.  The staff was totally inflexible and didn't seem to care that we walked out before eating.  They lost the business of 7 paying customers because of stupidity."}
{"text":"I rarely write negative reviews. But my last couple trips to Zanzibar has forced me too. I give a big BOOOOOO! to the service staff. I stopped in for a quick, \"to go\" dessert. The couple whom walked in just before me was told they had a 20 minute wait. I mentioned I would like a cobbler to go, then was told I had a 15 minute wait.   So a scoop of a pre-made dessert afforded me a 5 minute expedited window over dining patrons?"}
{"text":"I am here in Cleveland on business. I am staying a few doors down from Stone town. I just love the Catfish and grits. James has made me feel at home whenever I come in for a drink or for dinner. I would definitely return to Stone town and refer a friend. Ask for James!"}
{"text":"We were craving some good soul food and heard about this place from a friend. So we came with high hopes that it would be as good as Glady's in ATL. When we walked in we were impressed, the restaurant looks great But to our disappointment we were underwhelmed with the food n service. Under seasoned, over priced, & super slow service. Took about 20 mins to get our appetizers, my fianc√©'s turkey needed more gravy, when we asked for a little more, server said it would be an extra $1. Later she came back with a refill of his drink and it had white stuff on the top of His cup so we had to have her get him a new one and that took forever. So needless to say we won't be going back anytime soon. Hopefully they will improve."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The food was so good. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the red velvet waffles are like nothing I've had before. The best part of it all: the prices! I felt like I was ten years back in time. There wasn't one thing on the lunch menu over $9! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Terrible service the place was halfway empty and still the service was slow. We got seated and no one came to check on us for 45 minutes nor did we receive our food. Then the server comes and says\" you guys don't have any food\" after siting behind the bar talking with other servers. Worst experience will not come back."}
{"text":"This place has fallen off. From the rickety bar stools to the sticky bar. Crime is an issue in the area."}
{"text":"I ate at Stonetown on Friday night with some friends from out of town. Overall, we liked it and I would probably go back again to try some different items on the menu. Biggest downside for me was their cocktail prices are high.  I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Yard Bird and Red Velvet Waffles with Gritz. I've been wanting to go to Stonetown to try this specific menu item for a while. It was just okay - the waffles were not as sweet and cake-like as I was expecting. The chicken was delicious and the grits were also just okay. If you got a bite of everything - waffle, syrup, chicken, and gritz - all in one bite, then it was heavenly.  One of my friends ordered the Fried Catfish and Gritz. On their dinner menu online, they have this listed at $7.95, but it is actually $12.95 or $13.95. My friend really liked it and ate every bite.  My other friend ordered the Mini Fried Green Tomato BLT sliders and a side of Fried Okra. At first, the waiter said they were out of green tomatoes, but then apparently they weren't. My friend enjoyed them and she also really enjoyed the Fried Okra. She had high expectations because it is something her grandmother used to cook and the Stonetown okra lived up to those expectations.  Overall, I would give Stonetown a try if you are downtown and looking for something unique and different than other nearby restaurants. I would definitely like to go back and have brunch there someday."}
{"text":"Turkey chops and soul rolls were great. My server was very customer friendly ( Lonny) we really enjoyed ourselves. A return visit is a must."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great presentation. We had a Sunrise (lemonade + iced tea) and a Sunset (lemonade + red kool aid) to drink and the Stone Rolls to start, which were surprisingly delicious. For entrees we had the Catfish Po'Boy with sweet potato fries (I wasn't a huge fan of the coleslaw on the sandwich, but the remoulade served on the side more than made up for it) and the Fried Yardbird (which was on the dry side) with fried okra and grits (both good). Service was very good and we were quite pleased with the experience. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Just ok..... The service not so good. First we walk in there was no one was there to seat us, waited about 4-5 minutes, and finally a lady comes out and ask how can she help us, uhhh we want to sit down.   Next comes the ordering of food, I ask for a Blue Moon, the server says they have Blue Moon but no orange. I said how do you guys not have oranges, he says I don't know it's black owned. Like, wtf black people don't buy oranges, I mean it's not a big deal the orange, but the \"black owned\" comment was ridiculous..it didn't answer my question just say you ran out of oranges. I'm black and being black has nothing to do with not having oranges.  The food....I ordered the Cajun fried orange roughy which was tasty and so was the candied yams. However, the chicken and red velvet waffles was mediocre at best, the chicken was beyond over cooked and under seasoned, disgusting. The Mac n cheese tasted like shit!!!! It seemed old. It was dry as the desert! It was nothing but noodles and cheap cheese. I also asked for tarter sauce, by the time I received it I was half way through my meal. That's because two kids came in there trying to sell candy and the waitress went ape shit on them, yelling and telling them to get out. A whole big scene! So by the time she is done yelling at the kids to the point a patron at the bar stepped in and rescued those poor kids, I finally get my tarter sauce with no apology, just a here you go. Mind you the kids were actually nice kids, I can understand as a business not wanting them in there soliciting your customers, but there was no need for a scene. Those kids looked completely embarrassed and humiliated. I felt so bad I bought some candy from them.  Nonetheless I won't be returning. The service was horrible and the food subpar. Truthfully I could of just went to Angie's, the food would been good and cheaper!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is horrible!!! Our server Joy was the worst, she was slow with bringing our drinks, and food! We ordered appetizers that could of been great, but they were lukewarm. Our appetizer plates sat at our table well after we had finished, Joy didn't even bother coming to clear the table. About 20 minutes after finishing our appetizers, Joy decided to literally drop some muffins in the middle of our table. It toke forever to receive our entrees. It was just horrible. They need to hire better staff or train their current staff. I will not be back."}
{"text":"After waiting 22mins before being waited on. I enjoyed my meal. The waiter was named Q and he was wonderful. I give the service 3 stars. The waiter 4 stars and the food 5 stars. The only suggestion that I have is there should be less wait time when you are in a almost empty restaurant. We should have not had to get up and request a server/waiter."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Slow service.  No beer options.  Avg food. Although the gator sliders were pretty good, it's over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant. The food is mediocre at best. Fried chicken is dry and the fried crawfish was so breaded I could barely find the crawfish. But the worst part is the owner who has no idea about customer service. We had ordered the fried 1/2 chicken. Somehow they brought us a platter with two pieces of white meat and two wings and when the bill came they up charged for \"all white meat\" even though we did not ask for that. They said we should have realized that we were given the wrong pieces for a 1/2 chicken and said something. We argued that this was ridiculous since we don't know what they have in the kitchen and it was their choice to send out the platter. She insisted we pay the up charge or she \"would call the cops.\" I have never seen such disgusting behavior from management in any restaurant in any city."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had to change the rating of Stonetown based off of my return visit. We came for a Saturday brunch and left unhappy to say the least. The fried chicken was still great but nothing else was. There was only one other table filled and we literally were stuck in there for over two hours! It took 30 minutes just to get our drinks! They never apologized once for how ridiculous everything was. I will never go back."}
{"text":"On arrival there were only a few people there and it smelled of old mop water Tables were dirty and the hostess wasn't very welcoming. We stood and waited for the hostess to clean a table in basically a empty restaurant. I guess a employee noticed and offerd us a seat while we wait Once seated we learned there is no kids menu even though the website says there is. Once the waiter came he did confirm that the website is incorrect but had not been changed  So after calling a affiliate restaurant Chicago's Chicken and Waffles we left to go there and had a much better experience."}
{"text":"I always get the Fried Yardbird with red velvet waffles.  Amazing.  Includes a side of grits, which are delicious as well.  It's a great place to go before a sporting event, and the staff is always friendly and very welcoming.  Also, they have some of the best sweet tea ever...served in a mason jar and tastes like summer."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Banana blue pancakes, crispy bacon, and the best grits! Prefect stop before the Browns game."}
{"text":"The food is great,but the service is very slow. The only other knock on this place is. U can't order anything on the menu u want. U only can order certain stuff at certain times. Other than that it's a Gd restaurant."}
{"text":"The soul roll was probably the best aappetizer i have ever had. One of the best lunch experiences I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I went for the 1st time on my birthday.  Food and decor were excellent.  The soul rolls are a must try. Also our server Joe was the best."}
{"text":"Loved the d√©cor.  It's tastefully decorated with touches of Africa in the sculptures and art work.  We were graciously greeted and seated immediately.  Our server was probably new, as she didn't know the specials or the policy on side dishes.  A more experienced server sidled up to the table and gave us the 411 on the side dishes.  Our order was delivered quickly and the food was terrific.  I had the Honey drizzled fried chicken, which was perfectly seasoned and crisp.  My niece had the BBQ braised short ribs.  Again delicious and well seasoned.  I wasn't a fan of the black eyed peas, but the mac and cheese was just like mama used to make.  Although we were stuffed, we ordered dessert - the Better than Sex Cake and the Sweet potato pie.  The cake wasn't actually better than sex, but it was good and the sweet potato pie was overly sweet, however the crust was wonderful."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic experience. The food was great the service was casual and attentive. Don't even get me started about the red velvet waffles. Great great meal."}
{"text":"Me and four friends went for brunch.  Ordered straight forward off the menu.  The place looked lovely and we were one of only two tables that were seated. We first noticed poor service when it took 15 minutes for coffee and then another 20 for a coffee refill. An hour after seating the food began to arrive, one plate at a time.  Literally the server brought out one entree at a time before returning to the kitchen to get the next one. The process took over 5 minutes while we sat looking at our food waiting to eat.  A member of our party with a gluten intolerance was told that his meal was accidentally plated with bread and so they were recooking it in the kitchen.  It arrived 15 minutes later.    It was at this point that one of our party noticed there was chewed chewing gum stuck to the bottom of his plate.  His meal was then replaced which took forever again.    Almost none of the orders arrived as requested.  No ketchup here, turkey link instead of sausage there, fruit substituted for potatoes without asking for it, biscuits served without grits.    Worst of all was that almost none of these mistakes were acknowledged in a meaningful way by either the waiter or a manager (if there was even one on duty) and we were all charged full price and often even extra for the \"corrected\" substitutions.   It's too bad because the food was decent, but I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Although the food here is very good, the service is what's lacking. I have been here numerous times, and not once have I had a good dining experience. The first time went, I was told to sit at the bar, even though there were available tables, and once I sat at the bar I was told I had to leave and directed us to a different table due to being underage. After moving, 20 minutes passed before anyone came to take our order. After some time, the bar tender eventually had to take our order. We received the wrong appetizer, and was given the one we requested 10 minutes later. The second time I came here, I was sat down after a couple minutes of waiting, and once we were ready to order we were told we had to leave because the kitchen had shut down- mind you we came 3 hours before the closing time. During my last visit here, we encountered the same issue of timing, as a half hour passed and no order was taken. We had to flag down who seemed to be the manager, and he seemed flustered and annoyed. We were in the restaurant for two hours, and most of that time encompassed waiting for our food. The chicken and waffles, and macaroni is good. The soul rolls are very good, but inconsistent. Each order of soul rolls seems to be different from the other, some having more chicken, more corn, or more greens, not a balanced ratio of ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here last night before our comedy show, and had a light meal. The staff was courteous and friendly from the start. We originally made reservations for 6pm, but arrived at 5:30. We were able to be seated, as there was only one other table filled.   Our server, Julius was prompt and very friendly. Honest with his opinions on what we should try.   The food was great. I'd definitely recommend the catfish fingers. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars, is because I think the greens were a tad on the salty side."}
{"text":"Wow. I am so full right now I can barely type. I also have maple syrup, grease and hot sauce all over my fingers. So fat, so happy and so full of appreciation for this epic soul food brunch that I just took in. I've had Southern cooking in my travels to Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and even back home in Oakland and Stonetown ranks up there with the best. Buttermilk fried chicken and red velvet waffles? If only I had more space in my stomach. Possibly the best waffles I've ever had. Delicately fried catfish, slightly pickled green tomatoes, sweet potatoes on point. Friendly service, slow jams keeping the vibe on point and the Browns game on the multiple TV's made this the best possible brunch experience in a downtown largely devoid of Sunday brunch options."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and twenty minutes and had to leave hungry. We got there before a cavs game but well before the rush. It took the waitress twenty minutes to get our drinks and take our dinner order. Then we waited while others around us got their food. The waitress told us she saw our food coming up.  The next time we were able to get her attention, she told us she would have to ask the chef about the status of our food. When we finally decided we couldn't wait any longer, she offered to take the price of the entrees we never got off the bill. How generous.  When we asked to speak to the manager, we were told she was too busy. We might have been understanding had other patrons been waiting, but we saw several people who arrived after us eating their entrees."}
{"text":"Disappointed I have eaten here in the past while in town for the NBA finals, flew in town made plans to have dinner here walked in at 7:30pm and was told kitchen was closed with service like that will not come back.."}
{"text":"Their honey-glazed fried chicken is, in my opinion, the best fried chicken in Cleveland.  The other night I took a fellow fried chicken lover here after completion of his boards, and he was in full agreement that it was the best he'd had in town.  Not only is it perfectly fried (crispy on the outside, juicy and moist on the inside), but it comes on a bed of creamy potatoes and a side of your choice (my favorite is the corn and okra).    On a separate occasion I'd ordered their fried catfish po' boy sliders.  These were not the best- the fish was actually very fishy tasting and didn't give me the feeling I was eating anything remotely fresh.  My friend ordered the fried green tomato sliders which, while not out of this world, were still pretty tasty (much better than old fish at least!)  They also serve drinks outs out of mason jars (awesome), and give cornbread muffins as starters (both original and blueberry- yum!).  In short, come for their fried chicken, mason jar drinks, and cornbread muffins, but skip the fish!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and continue to love the food as well as the choices!  This time the pork chop smothered with gravy and onions on top of house potatoes was awesome, especially with the two great pieces of fried chicken on the side.  What a meal! My wife loved her short ribs with watermelon barbecue and side of macaroni too.......had to help finish it for her.  Oh we'll, my gain!"}
{"text":"The sauce on the Lobster Shrimp & Grit Cakes is to die for. Good wine selection and friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited Stonetown for the first time on Sunday June 9th following the graduation ceremony that was held for Euclid High School at the Wolstein Center.  The food was amazing and catered by Stonetown.  Our menu consisted of Fried and Grilled chicken, mac n cheese, grits, catfish, collard greens and I believe that was it needless to say I will be back we enjoyed ourselves immensely."}
{"text":"I visited Zanzibar on Friday June 22, 2012...I heard some great things about this place located on Shaker Square.....good ole soul food....right up my alley....the atmosphere was laid back, friendly, warm, and inviting....I started the evening with their happy hour, where I enjoyed the fried green tomatoes and they were deelish,,,along with the shrimp & grits, catfish fingers.....then on the dinner with a friend of mine who invited several others women to join us as she was leaving Cleveland and moving to Texas due to her job.  Dinner was awesome!!!! everyone tried something different and the side dishes were enough to share....I tried the honey glazed chicken, greens, sweet potatoes, cheese potatoes (tho they said they were not augratin they sure did taste like it but better) all of my meal was to die for.... others tried the jerk wings, red snapper, turkey & pork chops, mac & cheese...no complaints as those that could ate everything and those of us like me who couldn't well you know...to go box it was.....another cool thing is that they offer Kool Aid....Yes you heard me Kool Aid in a 32oz Mason Jar that you get to keep...tho I didn't get my mason jar...I will definitely be back....I also thought it would be a great place my parents would enjoy.....so I say check em out and give em a try....I don't think you'll be disappointed...I know I wasn't....and I shouldn't leave out that the service at the bar and our dinner table were excellent.....Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Chicken and red velvet waffles with grits were amazing!  Surprisingly good value for the quality of food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Brunch Review  A serious lack of identity. They say they are a southern/soul style restaurant but I am not feeling the authenticity.   Food: 2 stars. Their signature Louisiana Quiche was a little above average but their \"Cajun potatoes\" had no kick and no Cajun taste.   Service: 1 star. Lack of urgency and attentiveness. Lack of training and flexibility. No real support staff structure. It seemed like employees were just wondering around without a designated function and accountability.  Vibe: 1 star. Lack of identity and real, southern soul feel.   Price: Louisiana Quiche and coffee cost $18. Enough said.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Service was slow it's not worth the price. I've had better service at a McDonald's it didn't feel like a inviting environment. The place looks very nice just wish the service was better"}
{"text":"This place has a nice decor, the food was in small portions but still good, I can eat two ultimate dinners, that didn't come with a vegetable , they need to get that together, All in all good dinner, it's a diamond in the rough, that really needs more attention to patrons as well as portions, service was excellent . We will be going back , just to see if it improved ."}
{"text":"I got the ribeye steak and I was absolutely disappointed. The texture was grainy and not cooked close to medium rare. The steak itself had chunks of fat everywhere and wasn't seasoned. I had to request another steak but to my surprise they gave me the same type of unappetizing steak. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"i completely fell in love with this place! food is amazing! everyone is so nice! i love the fact that reservations can be made!"}
{"text":"The food was interesting - fusion of soul food and various international cuisines. Ambiance is nice - lively bar scene. In terms of food, I didn't think the blend of honey and spices on the fried chicken really worked. It made me think I would rather have had just exquisitely done fried chicken. My wife's \"turkey chop,\" however, two chops total and each done in a different style, were very good, and the various sides as well. We took advantage of the $6 Monday Martini specials and the drinks were also good. Service was hit or miss - we sat for a fairly long time with no one noticing us and then when we were finally noticed the service was very, very good. Definitely a nice addition to Shaker Square and will go back to try more things."}
{"text":"I went to Zanzibar with family on the weekend for lunch. Seating was quick, but took the waitress 15 minutes to come to the table for a drink order. She came across as annoyed that we had to take a few more minutes to look over the menu. We ordered the kool-aid and it was mostly sugar... I thought I might have to see a dentist after half a glass. It TOOK ALMOST AN HOUR TO GET OUR FOOD AND THE WAITRESS DIDN'T COME BACK ONCE TO EXPLAIN THE WAIT. I had to get up and speak with the manager just to get some answers. Once we got the food, which tasted like it was covered in 10 TBS of salt. AND ONCE WE FINISHED WE HAD TO WAIT 45 MINUTES TO GET A CHECK... 2 OTHER STAFF HAD TO HUNT THE WAITRESS DOWN!! Then they TRIED to charge the gratuity on the check. I think they were lucky to get paid at all. The meal and service was SO bad they should have paid us! ZERO STARS."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Went for a friend's birthday. Staff was very friendly. Food was served fast. Not that busy but it was a Wednesday at 6:00 pm. Pleasant experience."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! We were visiting Cleveland from Philly/NYC and were told where majority of the nightlife was in the city. We stumbled across this and being a self proclaimed Soul Food connoisseur I had to try it out.  We walked into the sounds of a smooth tune, and were greeted at the door like we were walking through our favorite aunties front door. This place was bright, Chic, elegant, modern with huge windows facing out to the street.  Then we sit down and weren't in our seats 1 mins before our waitress came over, and she gave us the run down of everything. We started with the house Arnold Palmer (lemonade + sweet tea) - and it was amazing.   So we wanted to order the whole left side of the menu, everything looked so good. We knew we wouldn't be able to get an app and main course down, so we just ordered a main course. We ordered the Shrimp & Cheese Grits and Fried Chicken, Grits and Red Velvet Waffles. We also ordered a few fireball shots while we waited on our food  We saw the man that brought everyone's food coming out with a tray and he looked as if it was a small glow behind him. It was in that moment I knew that food was prepared by god himself.  This food was AMAZING. My shrimp and grits were perfect, The best cheese Grits I've ever had. I'm also 100% certain some bodies grandma was in the back with house  slippers and a Bonnet on preparing this food. IT WAS THAT GOOD.  I did have a piece of the red Velvet waffle and yes it also had a pinch of Jesus in that as well. I didn't try the fried chicken but my friend cried while she was eating it, so I'm assuming it was good.   We ended up ordering the Lobster fritters and desert and took it to go, cause we were stuffed.   Long story short, we're going back for another blessing before we head home.."}
{"text":"Reserved the party room for parents' 65th Wedding Anniversary dinner. Managers and servers were great! The food was good as well. I was totally pleased with the experience. Norma W."}
{"text":"Went to here tonight excited about the food after going to its sister restaurant Zanzibar in shaker heights. I've never been so disappointed. It started off nice but then after receiving our waters our waitress disappeared. It took another 15 minutes to get my kool-aid. When we were finally able to order we were told they were out of the greens, cabbage, mashed potatoes, and the ribeye. We waited about 30-35 minutes for our food. When it finally came out the food was ok, nothing spectacular. The waitress came to let my friend know that the they were out of the fried green tomatoes they ordered with their meal. They did give her 2 free sides to make up for it. The waitress never cleared our dirty dishes and water glasses were never refilled, the waitress actually brought a pitcher and set it in the middle of our table. In the end I was extremely disappointed with my experience here and probably will never be back."}
{"text":"Took my lady there for dinner a few weeks ago. The customer service was exellent, the food was fantastic, however. We were seated near the bar, it felt like they tried to put too many tables into an area they could not fit. It did get a little uncomfortable at times.  As far as the food itself, not one thing we had to eat was bad.  The fried green tomatoes were perfect and the best I've had in a long while.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and good people! drinks and food were spot on! James was great at waiting on us, making drinks and the food is slammin'"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant almost a month ago.  I ordered the veggie tray/non-meat tray. I ordered grits, greens, mac & cheese and fried green tomatoes. I am a huge fan of southern cuisine/soul food. I really enjoyed the mac & cheese and fried green tomatoes. The grit and greens were okay. I have had better grits & greens at home than at this restaurant. My friend ordered the fried catfish, which I took a bite of and it was very good. We had to wait about 25 minutes, but it was a Friday night and we did not have a reservation so I won't take off points for our lack of preparation. The food arrived fairly quickly, which really impressed me. The following are things I did not enjoy about this restaurant: It was very loud (kids in a school cafeteria loud); the  hostess was missing from her podium at the entrance so we stood there for 6-8 minutes before anyone assisted us; we did have servers pass us on their way to their to the outdoor/patio/sidewalk area, but I guess they were anxious to receive a good tip instead of being aware of customers awaiting service; if you have on a non casual outfit, I would advise you not to have them  seat you in the cramped outdoor area; the hostess seated us at a sticky table, so he had to come over & wipe down the table, but it was still sticky after he wiped it down (tablecloths or those papers that go over tablecloths should be in this restaurant, but what do I know, I don't own a restaurant); & the server was a bit inexperienced, but you have to learn how to do your job, maybe a more experienced server could shadow the newbies. Overall, based on food I ordered & service I have to give three stars. I'm guessing this is a new restaurant? I would go back for another visit, hopefully by then Zanzibar will work out the quirks in their resturant."}
{"text":"This location is beautiful inside. Everything is modern and the restaurant is in a good location downtown. However..... the service wasn't that great. The guy was nice but he seemed like he was sidetracked or in a rush. Plus, he did not take the time to get us familiar with the food menu when we were asking questions. When my boyfriend and my kids received their food it looked really good and they really seem to enjoy it. I on the other hand ordered a salad. I had to wait 10 minutes after my family received their food in order to get my SALAD. I mean it's lettuce! So I'm not sure why it takes 30 minutes to receive a Ceasar salad. I started munching on their food because I was pretty hungry. It definitely put a damper on our time, but we made the best of it. My boyfriend was anxious to go out to eat here but we were just disappointed. Three stars because the food was good..."}
{"text":"I have been to Zanzibar twice now and on both occasions have found the wait staff to be very attentive and efficient. I would highly recommend the soul rolls, they are absolutely delicious. I also tried the collard green dip with pita toast - How divine. The food portions and quality exceed expectations and I look forward to my next visit. Sadly, each time I've gone I have not had room to experience the dessert and I hear it is heavenly. Plan on waiting because this experience is in high demand. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Experience: Well. The place looks nice inside. The waitress was even nicer. However, my Mother's Day went south when shortly after leaving(like 15 min), I had the most disturbing and awful experience from the food that I ate there (I will leave the details to your imagination). I called the Manager, Shawn to discuss the details among other things. Did I get a follow up call? No! Did I get an offer to discount my bill or etc.? No! Basically, I talked to deaf ears. So the end note is if their food has a negative effect on you due to their preparation, its on YOU!  Eat at your own risk!!"}
{"text":"Save your money and run far away. The food was horrible after we waited over 40 minutes after placing our order. Service does not exists here and our bill was $20 over with things we did not order. We saw our waiter twice , when ordering and when asking for the check. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before, and I live in the area. The first time, I took my mother here for mother's day and we were seated outside (the only available table) that was cramped in a tiny space with 5 other tables. Waiters had a hard time getting to us and there was nowhere I could sit without touching someone else's back. Ugh.  The second time, we went just as they had opened so it was just my bf and I and two other couples. I really LOVED the decorations and how it was set up. Our waiter was awesome. The food to me, isn't anything special. I feel like I could make everything I ate much better in my own kitchen, and I'm not even bragging, I'm no chef. I will give them props on their grits, though! Of course it's expensive, it's soul food.  The only thing worth coming back to this restaurant is the kool-aid/lemonade combinations they give you in a mason jar, and for an extra 2 bucks you can take it home with you, refilled."}
{"text":"I usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but Zanzibar gets two stars from me. Me and my girlfriend checked this place. Very nice on the inside. Great decor, but the customer service ruined it for us. Server had a bit of an attitude, they brought our food to the wrong table, and the server was annoyed because she felt like we hadn't ordered enough food. They should really work on customer service with their staff."}
{"text":"I showed up with a group of 6 people. We were seated at a table that was sticky. We realized that ALL the tables were designed that way. Our server came and let us know he was new. He seemed pleasant enough. He let us know if we wanted alcoholic drinks, we'd need to pay cash for them, as the swipe machine for cards wasn't working. A friend wanted a spiked Kool-Aid...which cost $12 ($9 for the one shot of vodka, which you couldn't even tell was in the drink). Our server took our drink orders and then disappeared for 20 minutes.   When he finally returned, we put in our orders. 40 minutes later, some random people brought out part of our food. One of the orders didn't include the side that had been ordered. Myself and my girlfriend never got our food. No one brought it out. We looked around for our server, who was too busy chatting up another table to even come check on us. A friend found a random employee who was eating at the bar (and possibly the manager) to check on our food. After an additional 15 minutes without my food, the \"manager\" brought out my chicken and waffles. He then told my girlfriend that her food takes 35 minutes to prepare. By my clock, 55 minutes had past. It should have been done. Not a single apology was provided. My waffles were cold and the chicken was grocery store quality.   Our server returned to apologize for the wait. But it wasn't his fault you see. He put our orders in right away. It was the kitchen's fault. In a restaurant that wasn't even half full. On a Saturday. So after an hour, we had all finally gotten our food (except my friend who had an extra side...that still never came out until well after her meal was finished).  All told, not one single person apologized or tried to rectify the situation. No one offered to comp anything. Isaiah apologized again for the kitchen's error in not making the food quickly...even though my food was partially cold, meaning it was ready, but no one bothered to get it. The \"manager\" was rude and dismissive of the fact that some of our party received their food while the other two were left sitting for 15 minutes waiting and watching everyone else eat. We left as quickly as we could after receiving our checks.   If you're thinking of going to Stonetown, don't bother. Its mediocre food and HORRENDOUS service."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time with a friend. I had the honey glazed chicken with scalloped potatoes and cajun corn. The chicken was crunchy the honey glaze was sparse. It was good but not stellar.  I read other reviews of the chicken and wondered what they were eating. The corn was ok as was the potatoes.  Overall this dinner wasn't any better than what I could make at home.  I also got a peach cobbler to go and I felt robbed. I would have expected more for the $5.95 that I paid.  It was maybe 2 tablespoons of pie and I think that's being generous.  The wait was long even though we had reservations and our waitress was not too friendly.  I've had better service at Bob Evans.  The atmosphere was nice and the place was crowded. By the way our menus were very dirty and there was food on the wall where I was sitting.  Overall not impressed and I won't run back anytime too soon."}
{"text":"I came for a happy hour appetizer and drink. I got the veggie tempura which was average. Rather than actual tempura it's more like breaded deep fried vegetables. Broccoli was good, the others not so much.   They have no beer on tap, but happy hour bottles are reasonably priced at $3. Their cocktail selection appears impressive, but my bartender's recommendation is really not very good, it tastes like alcoholic 'fruit punch' from concentrate.  The sticky bar doesn't help.  Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I went here for Fathers day and was totally upset. There were flies everywhere. The waiter was less than nice and was upset every time we spoke about the many flies that we dined with. We talked to the manager and her only solution was to move my family and I to another table. We waited an hour for a table after making reservations. They try to be upscale and try to compete with the likes of Fire but they will never be on there level until they can be a professional restaurant. I was very disappointed in their service and wish that they would listen to their customers. I will not be retuning and wish that I could give them a -5 stars. Zanzibar has to do better if they want to compete in the Shaker Square area. They will never be taken seriously."}
{"text":"We went here on Mother's day after the disastrous meal at their sister restaurant Jezebel's hoping for better. We were seated right away and we super hungry so we ordered right away. I ordered the candied yams which I knew I would take home, the fried wings, and red velvet waffles. My cousin had the chops with gravy, rice, and greens. Only issue was my pet peeve that when my plate was brought out my wings were about to fly off, because there were feathers on each one just sticking up. The server was kind and brought me out some different wings and I ate in peace.  The red velvet waffles weren't bad, but were just regular ole' waffles to me, nothing spectacular. I wasn't wowed but I also didn't leave hungry so yeah........"}
{"text":"Went here about 2 weeks ago with my cousin for a girls night out. When we walked in the door the service was great we were seated quickly and there wasn't a huge crowd YET! To order I started out with the fried green tomatoes which were fresh and very hot. The sauce they served with it was very good. It was different actually because I could taste the sauce in it and it would be perfect on the side with chicken wings. My cousin had the soul rolls which which are egg rolls that have greens and again it was very different but good and it was served with the same sauce on the side that was served with the fried green tomatoes. For my entree I had the turkey chops smothered in gravy with Mac and cheese and yams. I had to send my Mac and cheese back because it tasted awful. As a soul food restaurant there is no way your macaroni and cheese should not be on point. It tasted bland and it looked like they only put cheese on top of the Macaroni when it baked so it was just dry boiled noodles. The chops were excellent in flavor, although they weren't that hot when they brought it out. The plate was warm to touch. The server was very kind and brought out a different side and I chose the cajun corn which had okra and tomatoes, but it was just okay. Nothing to rave about. The yams were delicious!!! To drink I had a hurricane which was veryyyyyy strong. lol. no complaints about that. but since I was driving I had the server bring out some more oj to tame it down. I couldn't resist ordering a purple haze to go which is basically just lemonade and purple kool aid in a mason jar and its soooooo good!!! I definitely urge everyone to try it. Bad thing about the night was that it became super crowded for the Friday night rush and it took 45 minutes to get our check and a dessert my cousin ordered to go. We had to have another server find our server which didn't leave us very happy! Overall since I do believe in second chances I'll definitely be going back and trying the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"As I walked in I thought wow this place is classy casual. The astmosphere was very nice. When you walk in the bar is in front with ample seating. To the right were tables and a couch, chairs and a table near a fire place. It was only 2 people I'm sure because of the weather. It was snowing like crazy. I ordered fried green tomatoes and the chicken and red velvet waffles.  The tomatoes were ok. I tasted a lot of breading not so much tomatoes. The sauce that came with them was so delicious that I wanted to lick the container it came in!!!!   The chicken was one of the best fried chicken I've ever had!!!!! The waffles were great as well. The dish came with 2 wings and 2 small waffles and grits. I added cheese to my grits but it would've been nice if the waitress would've told me they charge 50 cent extra.   The prices are about $8 for and entree and I think it's a great value for the food. Can't wait to go back and try the catfish."}
{"text":"we stopped in here on St Patrick's Day  and the place was not very busy so we thought we would give it a go , first of all the server was good but the kitchen had a serious problem getting the food out  , took way too long for a simple order. I do have  to say that the food was just ok , I was disappointed in my meal as it should have been a knock out for a soul food restaurant. ,would I go back ? maybe , we will see."}
{"text":"Went to Zanzibar with a group of 7 for a birthday celebration.  I live 40 mins from this restaurant, so I won't be rushing back.    Appetizers: I was able to try the fried zucchini which was crispy on the outside and not mushy on the inside. The soul rolls with chicken were very good.  Entree: Smothered Pork Chops, with collard greens, rice and yams.  The chops were tender and the smothered part wasn't drowning in onions which I liked a lot.  There were a couple of issues regarding the side items.  The yams were unremarkable.  The collard greens were awful - way too much vinegar.  Apparently, this was just an off night for the greens.  Others at the table said that the greens are usually good.  The wild rice was the only side item that I liked.  Dessert: I tried both the peach and apple cobblers and both were disappointing. I really wanted the sweet potato pie, but I wasn't willing to pay $4.95 or $5.95 for a slice.  The night started off very good with great appetizers, main entree was very good, the sides weren't great and dessert was the blah ending.  Service: I thought Thomas the Ma√Ætre d' was very rude when he decided to announce to our table of 7 who had just spent $30 - $40 each, that he needed our table for another group.  We hadn't even been cashed out yet.  Bo our server who has only been working there 1 month did a nice job.  The appetizers took forever to come out, but I don't know if that was Bo's fault or the kitchen.  I would go back if I was in the neighborhood, but it won't be someplace I make a special trip to visit."}
{"text":"A tough review because as much as I love the food the service has been abysmal twice now and it can't make up for the great food.   Buttermilk chicken and red velvet waffles are amazing and the mixed cocktails are tasty and not diluted. Shrimp and lobster fritters have a great sauce. Sides are great although wee served cold the first time and subsequently redone.   The service lacks all round. From the lackadaisical greeting to the always constant need to ask for water, cutlery, the check, there is a basic lack of service. Such a shame because the food really is tasty!"}
{"text":"Great place.  I got the fried catfish and grits.  It tasted great.  The red velvet waffles were great too."}
{"text":"Great quesadilla and unique waffles!! Excellent late night menu. Bartenders are really nice and their drinks are very flavorful, al though a little pricy for my liking. Will definitely be back soon for the food!! I hope they continue to stay open late."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland with my girlfriend. We scanned Yelp for a few restaurants in the city and decided to try Stonetown. She never had \"soul\" food so I thought it would be fun to try something different. She ordered a lobster quesadilla and I ordered a blackened catfish with grits. I tasted the quesadilla which tasted good but the true highlight of the dinner adventure was the catfish. The waiter brought two filets on a bed of grits. The presentation was not particularly amazing because the filets where placed on top of each other like a cross (personally, I would have chosen to put them side by side - seriously, presentation is important). Aside from the presentation, however, the taste of the catfish was delicate. The fish was well cooked, pan seared and truly flavorful. I am not a huge fan of grits. Yet, the grits was amazing because it was soft, creamy and tasty. Along with the catfish I got ice tea which I found sweet and very good. At the end of the night I chose to try the apple cobbler. After a few bites, my girlfriend agreed, I realized that the dessert was not to my liking because it tastes either old and/or somewhat acidic (it's not clear to me if the apple cobbler should really taste like that and my feeling is that the answer is no). The ambient and the interior design of the restaurant are great. There is a bar area and nice country-style tables. There are also several televisions so you can watch the local Cleveland Indians if you can't go to the stadium. The restaurant stays open until late at night, something that other restaurants in the area do not do. All in all I give Stonetown 4 stars. I would have given 5 stars but I can only give 4 for two reasons. The first one is that I felt as if the server was a little reserved which can make customers uncomfortable (not me though). After telling him that I liked the catfish I was able to break the ice and he was suddenly more smiley. The second was due to the apple cobbler which really disappointed me. Hopefully, the manager and the cook will read my review and use my feedback for improvement."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch at 12:30, and were a bit disappointed to see we could only order from the brunch menu before 1:00.  We had two little ones with us, and there was no way we were going to sit and wait 30 minutes before ordering our food.  Fortunately the waitress informed us that we could still order appetizers and sides from the dinner menu, which is exactly what we wanted anyway.  We shared a variety of sides, and all were extremely delicious.  My favorite was probably the Cajun creamed corn, and my son really gobbled up the catfish fingers.    One great thing to keep in mind is the $1.50 parking in the garage next door - no matter what the posted rate is.  So if you're going to an even downtown, park here, grab some food or a drink, and you'll probably come out saving money!  Make sure you ask the attendant when you pull in for the correct ticket, and then you pay the $1.50 when you pay your tab at the restaurant.  The only negative for me was the lack of changing table in the restroom (also no handicapped stall).  There was plenty of space to add one though.  They also have a lot of high-top tables, which don't work with high chairs.  We were lucky to get the last regular height one.  Our service was great, and the place was clean and spacious.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was great. The portions were huge for the price. The drinks were not for the faint of heart. The watermelon bbq sauce on the grilled salmon was finger-licking good! I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Cajun red fish dish was excellent. It had great flavor it was not overcooked and had a couple of shrimp that were very tasty. Great job great service great dish. My friend had the fried chicken she was trying to eat the bones it was that good."}
{"text":"After coming here for dinner once, I'm not sure I can confidently say I'll be coming back. There are plenty of similar restaurants that I'm more likely to visit for a few reasons.   To begin with, our server was in outer space. He was slow at drink orders and seemed really confused about even just listing the available drafts. As we sat and waited for our beers and companions, we realized that the table was sticky. Like the-tree-that-died-for-it-is-still-oozing-sap-sticky. OK, got past the server and the table, ordered food. I was torn between chicken and waffles and the lobster quesadilla. I went with the quesadilla to switch things up since I almost always get chicken and waffles if they're available. While the innards of the quesadilla were pretty OK, I could only get a couple of bites out of each wedge before setting aside the rest of the plain tortilla. So dry and plain and wasting space in my stomach. Bleh.   Suggestion: make the lobster and cheese mixture that's in the quesadilla into a dip and throw some crisped pita or tortilla on a plate to go with it. I guarantee that will sell and people won't waste a bunch of floppy dry tortillas."}
{"text":"After discovering Zanzibar, I can't quit coming back! The happy hour is one of my favorites and has proven to be a perfect girls' night out with delicious fruity drinks! I'm not normally a fruity cocktail girl, but this is the place to get them.  The food here is all good. I've never been disappointed with anything. (The fried green tomato experience in my last review is pretty on par every time. But I find that fried green tomatoes aren't generally the most flavorful of treats anyways.) Happy hour features $2 off drinks and appetizers, so I like to bring a friend and order a plethora of appetizers to enjoy, which just ends up gorging because I just can't get enough of it. The shrimp and grits and the soul rolls are two of my personal favorites. So delicious and full of flavor! The collard green and artichoke dip changed my life; I'll never look at spinach and artichoke dip the same (it pales in comparison to the collard green version).   Zanzibar is definitely a go-to if I'm craving a happy hour deal with great food!"}
{"text":"Now I have been coming to this place for years and it was great initially. The last few times I have encountered an issue each time. Father's Day I brought a friend here for dinner and both of our chicken dinners had feathers on it and the waitress didn't bring us our cornbread. We had to ask for featherless chicken and our cornbread for our $80 meal. The next time which was several months later I came and ordered the jerk wing meal with greens and there was a long strand of black hair sticking out of the dish. (I have red hair). I mentioned it to the waiter and she hurried up to grab it and brings me back another dish and told me it was a fresh pot. I couldn't tell if it was or not, but didn't really feel engaged to eat it after seeing hair the first time. She also did not offer a discount for my turnt stomach. The last time was two days ago and this bartender/ waiter gives me this watered down Hennessy side car drink. I order them almost every time I come and they are typically dark colored. This clown hands me a drink so clear I can see through the glass. I tell him I want him to get another one and he brings back one that is slightly darker but still way lighter than usual. This time my friend sends it back then here comes the manager saying I had to pay for the second drink even though I didn't have a sip. Now it's a $9 drink, I should have actual Hennessy in it. So I paid and dumped the drink where it belonged.  Hopefully they get back on track because they are definitely going downhill."}
{"text":"The service, the ambiance, the drinks and especially the food was so so damn good! Southern comfort food gone fusion! This place was one of a kind and we were so glad to have stumbled upon it. We came in for brunch, maybe six items on the menu and the choice was difficult! My only regret was that I didn't get the yardbird and red velvet waffle! I will go back to Cleveland, and I will stop here for a meal again!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and it was AWESOME! I got the quiche - my mom got the open face biscuits and gravy, with two eggs and taters - my husband got the yardbird and waffles. Def coming back for lunch or dinner next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday on Saturday night.  The food was awesome - chicken and red velvet waffles were dinner and dessert, blackened catfish was excellent.  The appetizers were good and the sauces for them were so good we got more to have with our entrees.  The service was great.  Our server knew the menu inside and out.  She was also serving a party of about 12 and still kept our small table happy.  The owner/manager stopped by to chat and make sure everything was good.  We will be back soon to try to the gator sliders!"}
{"text":"This southern-fusion spot is downtown just a few blocks from East 4th Street and The Q.  The concept is great, but both my wife and I were disappointed with the execution.  I had the fried turkey with gravy and onions, and although the flavor was good the turkey was cut so thin that it turned out to be very dry.  My wife had the lobster, shrimp and grit cakes served in a creole sauce...she said the dish was a bit monotonous and overly spicy.  Wish we could rate this higher, but next time we want soul food we will probably head to Angie's."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Bad news first... The yardbird was overcooked, which made it unbearably dry.  Now that I've gotten that out of the way. Everything else was great!! The fish nuggets were perfectly seasoned and fried. They weren't heavily breaded, so you are able to taste the fish. The red velvet waffles can either be breakfast or dessert. Delish!!  Tried the Grand Royal cocktail. It's not a bad drink, if you like sweet juice-like drinks. Which brings me to the Kool-aid... Yes!! Kool-aid is actually on the menu. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. It's a great place to visit any time of the day."}
{"text":"I wanted to dig this place.  I'm from Oklahoma originally, know a thing or two about soul food.  But......  The catfish was great.  Great spice in the batter.  Loved it.  Would order again. However--the entree was SUPPOSED to come with collard greens and grits.  Not a grits fan.  Told waiter would happily pay $1.50 extra to swap fried okra for the grits.  However, when plate came--no collard greens.  It was spring mix--and spring mix that wasn't even wilted.  I may be an Okie, but I know collard greens, and spring mix ain't collard greens.  No explanation.  And I didn't throw a fit about it.  That's not how I am.  Watched table behind me--they got spring mix too.  But they were newbies about soul food.  When you pull that kind of stuff, it ticks me off.  If you don't have any collard greens--say so; and give the customer a chance to pick something.    As for the okra--it was interesting.  Instead of being cut into slices, it was the whole okra pod fried in a light tempura batter.  I like that.  But I am bemused by the whole pod thing.  Can't decide if I liked it or not.  Now for the worse thing--we also ordered a side of hopping john (aka black eyed peas).   We make this EVERY January 1--old custom, for luck in the coming year.  Ours were much much much better than this.    They had no spice.  We make ours with red pepper flakes, salt pork, bay leaves.  It's nice and spicy.  I put some of the hot sauce the waiter provided into the hopping john and it didn't help.  This was very disappointing from a soul place.    The corn bread was very very good.  So...long story short.  Fried catfish and corn bread--YEAH!! Hopping john--BOO Okra--undecided No collard greens--ticked off."}
{"text":"Great spot and good food.  I stopped by with a coworker for dinner. Wasn't disappointed at all.  Appetizer was catfish tenders with and they were great! Entree was grilled pork chops with rice and collards. Outstanding and for dessert bread pudding. I was this down with a mason jar size of Kool-Aid and I also got a to go jar! The only thing I didn't like was the jalape√±o cornbread - just gotta leave it alone!  This place was great and I will be coming back..."}
{"text":"Loved it! Southern-style soul food in Ohio? We had banana/blueberry pancakes and red velvet pancakes w/fried chicken and grits. Yum! Nice sized portions, reasonable price. Just unique enough to be fun, but not so different that you wonder what you just ate! We want to go back for lunch or dinner! Host/server very friendly. New to southern and/or soul food? Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch. Banana blueberry pancakes were very good. Quick service and great prices."}
{"text":"Being new to Cleveland, we asked around about the best places to eat. So many people had told us Zanzibar's was amazing, so we decided to try it - despite these bad reviews here which I really do not believe accurately portray this restaurant.  Our server was amazing - Justin. He was new, but very friendly and knowledgeable. He told us his favorites on the menu - the turkey chops and honey fried chicken - so that's what we ordered. It was amazing, the best food we have had so far in Cleveland. The portions were huge, we really could have shared one dish. The drinks were great too. They were a large size and they did not skimp on the alcohol content either. We will DEF be going back. Don't let these reviews scare you. You must go try it!!"}
{"text":"good place for a nice soul food lunch or dinner.  great atmosphere.  great place to grab some wine, and relax.... even if you want to catch the cave game!"}
{"text":"I'm down in Cleveland on a nice short vacation (from NY) to see the Cavs play so I decided to make the weekend out of it.. stumbled upon Zanzibar and decided to go in. This place is FANTASTIC !!! Their soul food is soooo delicious. Everyone in the restaurant is super kind and helpful especially the hostess & the bartender. This is a must.!!"}
{"text":"This is a upscale soul food restaurant. I've been a couple times with friends while in town and have never been dissapointed with the food. I highly recommend the catfish fingers which is on the menu as a 'teazer'. They may have the best catfish recipe I have ever had. The meal accompanies a sauce which me and my friends refer to as 'Crack sauce' because it has to be laced with something. It is soo good. We have been trying to figure out the ingredients and even asked but of course they won't tell (side eye). Also the collard greens and artichoke dip is amazing.   The only con has nothing to food but wine selection and cost. It's a restaurant so I expect a glass would cost around $10 however the wine glass doesn't equate to a real glass of wine. Plus the wine selection is a selection of corner store cheap wine. For example the Aandre Moscato is $8 for a skinny glass of wine when a whole bottle is $5 at the store. But again you not at the store so... Anywhoo it's definitely a must go if in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Was very surprised that more people were not in here.  Accidentally ran across this place in downtown and definitely did not leave disappointed.  Very nice atmosphere, staff, and food.  I had the chicken, red velvet waffles, and Mac & Cheese.  If ever in Cleveland again, I will surely be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Must give it 5. Came on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. I was seated quickly. Waiter was very nice. I ordered the fried chicken and fried catfish combo. It came in 10-15 minutes, not to long and not too soon. Chicken and fish tasted fresh and were cooked thoroughly. My sides of yams and home potatoes with white sauce where great! Finished it all no need for a take home container."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for dinner after seeing Aladdin. Gotta say, we were a little hesitant because it seemed only 1/3 full and the reviews were so so. However, the restaurant quickly filled up after we got there, so don't be deceived, seats go quick!  We got the ultimate feast with fried catfish and a fried + smothered turkey chop - both were tasty. However, I think it's hard to screw those up.  The two sides with that were the house potatoes (AMAZING, absolutely best thing I had that night) and the collard greens which in my opinion tasted bitter like they hadn't been cooked down enough.  We also got the honey glazed fried chicken - delicious and would definitely get it again  2 sides with that were candied yams - delicious, not too sweet and not over cooked And the baked Mac n cheese - perfectly cooked, the noodles were perfect, and they didn't overdo the cheese.  We also got their sunrise drink - very generously sized, and sweet!  Definitely looking forward to coming back here again"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down over the years. Yesterday I entered during lunch, no one waiting, near empty restaurant  and the lady says \"sit over there I'll be with you shortly\". No, \"hello\", \"may I help you\", nothing. Our server seemed rushed and not very friendly.   I ordered the pork chops with macaroni and house potatoes. The chops were fine and as always, the potatoes were awesome. However, the macaroni was dry and I didn't even eat it.   What keeps me coming back? Soul Rolls"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of people before a cavs game to try out something different. Let me say that we wish we didn't. First off I made reservations, they called me a day after to confirm, and then we arrive with the place half empty they say that they don't have my reservation. Next they have a bit of a limited drink menu and the server was saying that he had to charge the drinks on a separate bill which really confused us. After getting drinks and ordering we were pretty much left for 40 min without nothing until we had to make a little bit of noise to get our food out. The food though did taste pretty good. I had the drunken yardbird while another person had the lobster quesadilla. We had to rush a bit to catch the game so due to the horrible service we could not enjoy the food much.  All in all I would not go back to this place. It has a lot of potential though to be a good restaurant but it is not ran good. There are plenty of other better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed after noticing stonetown a month ago and wanting to try their interesting menu, me and my girlfriend didn't get the chance. After arriving there this very cold evening we were snubbed by the hostess and told there would be an hour wait. We noticed 3 empty tables and no-one in front of us waiting. With so many other great restaurants to try in Cleveland I don't need this snobbery type behavior."}
{"text":"My favorite is their side sampler, I love the veggies here and they are sure, unlike some soul food restaurants, to make their veggies with no meat.  So every now and again I visit for a few tasty vegetables and a corn muffin."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Server was friendly and genuine.  Pleasantly surprised to have such good soul food in Cleveland.  We had fried catfish and the lobster fritters.   Ah-mazing! What a gem!!"}
{"text":"Must Try Soul Food!  My wife works with some people from Cleveland and asked for a good Soul Food restaurant and Zanzibar came highly recommended.   We had already looked at the menu online and pretty much knew what we wanted. As we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and quickly seated. The decor is very nice with a cozy waiting area with a fireplace and a few tables to play Chess will you wait for a table. The space is a lot of dark browns with hard wood floors and candles on the tables. This would be a great date night spot. Sandra, our waitress brought us water and menus. Our drinks and corn muffins came out quickly. I had the sweet tea, my wife had the \"Purple Rain\" (grape Kool-Aid and Lemon Aid) and our daughter had Red Kool-Aid.   My wife and I both ordered the Honey Glazed Fried Chicken, (1/2 of a chicken in dark meat which was two large thighs and two drumsticks for each of us.) with \"House Potatoes\" (similar to Au Gratin) and baked mac & cheese. Our daughter had the Chicken & Waffles with grits. The chicken was hot and juicy, perfectly seasoned with nice crunchy skin, some of the best fried chicken I have ever had! The potatoes were very good as well but, the mac & cheese was OUTSTANDING!!!!!! My daughter doesn't really like grits so I swiped them and they were delicious! Nice, thick and creamy, just a bit too salty for my taste.   During our meal we were greeted by the owner. He asked how our meals were and how we had heard about his restaurant. We told him we were visiting from Pittsburgh and he told us that he was originally from Aliquippa, a nearby town. We also started to talk about cars and how he was looking at a Porsche Cayenne from Porsche of Beachwood and I was telling him about the one I had just bought there and also about upcoming Lexus cars as we both drive Lexuses as well. We went on for at least ten minutes. He is such a nice guy and he was very down to earth.   My only two complaints are that there is no kids menu. (There were four other children there while we were there.) And that we were only given a tiny little basket of corn muffins (maybe 5) with no butter and the table next to us was given a huge basket of corn muffins (at least 15 ) and butter.  Zanzibar easily blows away any Soul Food restaurant I have ever tried in Pittsburgh. The decor is upscale, the food is amazing, the prices are dare I say cheap for the quality and amount of food your get, the owner is from the Pittsburgh area and the service was top notch. We will be back EVERY TIME we are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and it was crazy busy.  It took nearly 30-40 mins to get seated, but we didn't have reservations (next time I'm making a reservation).  Once getting seated we got some great cornbread and blueberry muffins.  They were offering a pre-fixe meal (Shake the Square) for $33 per person, which I ordered.  My girlfriend ordered an entree and just shared the appetizer and dessert of my meal.  This is a good idea for most couples to do because the entrees are big and can be a little tough to finish.  Our server was awesome and attentive when she wasn't busy with all her tables.  The appetizer was the soul roll (what I call the soul food garbage can in egg roll form), fried green tomatoes (done right), and perfectly cooked jerk chicken wings.  Entree the ultimate feast with 1/4 chicken and salmon croquette (this is a not order again...kinda tasted like tuna instead of salmon) and cajun corn side (decent).  My girlfriend got the honey glazed fried chicken with a collard greens (okay).  Our dessert was the peach cobbler, which was the perfect cap to the meal.  Overall if you want soul food, come here because they have everything you would want...fried chicken, mac n' cheese, collard greens, cobbler, chops, catfish, okra, etc.  Definitely at least a must try."}
{"text":"Even better than before!  My family had been to and loved the previous location's food so we couldn't wait to check out the new digs. I must say that the new space is even more beautiful and spacious compared to the previous one around the corner. I also love the huge new outdoor patio space. Perfect for people watching on a warm summer night. Zanzibar is defiantly the place where the well dressed soul food lovers go for date night. Most of the people there were casket sharp.  There was a 45 minute wait so we walked around Shaker Square to kill time. (You can now make reservations right from the Zanzibar website to avoid the wait.) http://zanzibarohio.com Once we returned, about 30 minutes later we were being seated. We even had our same favorite server Sandra. She was as good as usual.  The last time we were there my wife and I both ordered the Honey Glazed Fried Chicken, (1/2 of a chicken in dark meat which was two large thighs and two drumsticks for each of us.) with \"House Potatoes\" (similar to Au Gratin) and baked mac & cheese and our daughter had the Chicken & Waffles with grits. So this time we all went with the Chicken & Waffles with grits. The chicken was hot and juicy, perfectly seasoned with nice crunchy skin, some of the best fried chicken I have ever had! The red velvet waffles were nice and fluffy. Almost a pancake consistency. The grits were delicious! Nice, thick and creamy!  I had the sweet tea, my wife and daughter had the \"Purple Rain.\" (grape Kool-Aid and Lemon Aid)   My only two complaints is that the Chicken & Waffles dinner doesn't come with the delicious basket of different corn muffins and there is still no kids menu.   I've said it before and it's worth saying again, Zanzibar easily blows away any Soul Food restaurant I have ever tried in Pittsburgh. The decor is upscale, the food is amazing, the prices are dare I say cheap for the quality and amount of food your get, the owner is from the Pittsburgh area and the service was top notch. We will be back EVERY TIME we are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I'm never coming back after this experience. Their service is terrible! It took an hour to get my food, and the place wasn't packed. Upon receiving my food I realize that they messed up my order and forgot to bring the additional side ordered for the other meal (which they still charged us for). I felt like I had to hunt down my waitress every time I wanted more water, and whenever I asked it took her about 20 minutes to come back with it. It took a long time to receive my check and when I realized they had charged me for a side that was never given to us, I didn't even bother asking her to remove the charge only because I knew that meant I'd have to wait around for another 30 minutes at the very least in order to resolve the issue--and my waitress didn't seem approachable. I was greatly disappointed because their food was pretty decent but the service is so bad I'd never think twice about going to this place again."}
{"text":"Just came back from this restaurant. I went because of restaurant week, the food was HORRIBLE!! Fried green tomatoes were disgusting. The tomatoes were dry and the batter was disgusting. The chicken was dry, the red velvet pancakes were tasteless. I will never eat here again. Oh and yes we waited at least 30 minutes to get  our check AFTER we asked for it twice!   Should just went to whitmores, b and M, or something of the like for wings.  The food may have a soul food name but a blind cat could make better food. SMH.  I don't want to give them even one star..."}
{"text":"I love soul food. It's comforting and it's the food I grew up on. Everyone at Zanzibar makes you feel right at home from the moment you walk in, and the decor is modern and warm.   My boyfriend and I went for Sunday brunch. Our waitress Camille was very welcoming and we both started with omelettes and waffles (apple & sweet potato, if my memory serves me). To drink, he got the Sunset -- lemonade & iced tea -- and I got the Sunrise -- lemonade & red Kool-Aid. Like the other Yelpers have mentioned, these drinks come in big mason jars. I'm sure this touch gives some restaurant-goers a sense of nostalgia.  We both ate way too much - sausage, bacon, greens, fried & baked chicken, baked macaroni & cheese, etc. I also got red velvet cupcakes to go, but these were a little dry. I definitely look forward to going back when I'm in Ohio again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good if it's fresh. The drinks are awesome but the service is horrible! They hardly ever come back to check on you and the food takes forever! I even tried to call ahead and order take out and was left on hold repeatedly with my call never to be answered. What a shame for such a nice place!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and had a good time. Our server was prompt and polite as well as efficient. We ordered the fried green tomatoes entree and the chicken and waffles. Enjoyed both, especially the grits, but wasn't impressed by the biscuit. It was huge but not particularly flavorful. Would return, it's a nice space with tasty food and quality service."}
{"text":"Visited on a weeknight for dinner. Overall I will definitely be coming back here as the food was delicious and service was good. I would say in general the \"sweet\" foods/drinks are a little too sweet. But now that I know that, I would probably pass on the sweet tea if I was having the candied yams but if I was having fried chicken and grits I'd have the sweet tea.  Pros: -Not crowded, no wait for a table -hostess was polite -waitress was knowledgeable about the menu items, gave great recommendations -waitress checked on our table several times -good was delivered fairly quickly -reasonably priced -pleasant decor, clean -complementary basket of sweet potato and blueberry corn muffins  Cons: -limited parking  Food:  -Soul Rolls which were delicious 5/5 -Jerk Chicken wings- large and meaty, will seasoned 5/5 -5/5 chicken and waffles were amazing! Waffles were not too sweet, 4 mini waffles, 3 pieces of fried chicken, chicken was so good, perfectly cooked, crispy, not greasy at all, comes with a side of grits, which were also good, I like mine a little more salty -4/5 honey glazed fried chicken, perfect pairing is sweet and salty, comes with mac n cheese (very cheesey, not dry) and house potatoes (just ok). -4/5 zanzibar feast, we got it with fried chicken, catfish (light, crisp, seasoned nicely), house potatoes, and Mac n cheese.  -4/5 candied yams, very sweet, but still really good -3/5 sweet tea, way too sweet. I could make 3 glasses of tea with the syrup from my 1 glass. -3/5purple rain, lemonade with grape Kool aid, very sweet -5/5 sweet potato pie, just YUM, not too sweet -4/5 peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream, again a bit too sweet, but still very delicious"}
{"text":"I was going to start this review off by saying, \"If you ever have the chance to eat at Zanzibar in Shaker Square, DON'T!\" But then I realized, I can't tell you what to do; but I can give you insight into my experience and let you decide if you'd like to waste your hard-earned money and/or time dining at this establishment. The food was terrible and the management is a disrespectful joke!  If you're going for something light and or healthy, this is not the place for you. Granted, this is a \"soul food\" restaurant, so that comes with the territory. There are virtually no real options for the health-conscience. Even the \"Vegetable Platter\" - which can be assumed to be the only \"real\" vegetarian option, aside from a salad - is a bit laughable; the choices being an a la carte mash-up of their starchy sides - only one of them being of the green variety.  If you get an appetizer, I suggest you DO NOT get the Soul Rolls. (Again, just a suggestion.) They were sold to us as, \"It's like having all of Thanksgiving dinner in one roll.\" They are greasy, not appealing to the eye, and not appealing to the taste buds either. How something can be overly salty yet spicy at the same time is amazing, but it's pulled off in this dish.  The main dishes were the biggest disappointment of the night (other than the management; but I'll get to that in a second). First of all, each meal has this pre-planned side dish, that you cannot change unless you pay an extra charge; and an additional \"free\" side dish. Why you cannot sub out a side dish of equal price without paying extra is baffling, and the reason was never actually clarified. And the way it was explained, even if you opt to only have one side dish, you still can't have the side dish you want unless you pay an extra charge. (So say your entr√©e comes with the Cajun corn, but you want the yams instead without the additional free side. You'd still have to pay extra to make that happen.)  I had the \"Bar B Qued Braised Beef.\" The sauce was nice and tangy, but the main star - the beef - was dry as chalk. Somehow, it was fork-tender, yet lacking any juiciness or flavor. The Mac-n-Cheese, which had an additional charge tagged onto it, tasted like the equivalent of licking a salt block. Someone ordered the Half Baked Chicken and had the same complaint of saltiness.  On the menu, there is the Half Baked Chicken, mentioned above; and then directly below it is a sampler entr√©e called something along the lines of Feast of Zanzibar. It gives you the option to try two of the following in one dish: a Walleye cake, salmon croquette, something else, and ¬º chicken. It fails to mention what kind of chicken, so one would believe it would be the baked, if it's a sampler of something that's already listed on the menu. Someone ordered this dish with that assumption, and when it came out as fried chicken, the true disappointment came. It was addressed as soon as the food hit the table, and that's when we were finally informed that that's the only option because they don't bother to prepare the baked chicken as quarters as an option. When the person who ordered it didn't want anything else in its place because the only other options too were fried, but wanted keep the plate for the other protein and the side (she had to pay extra to sub out), the server offered to send the manager over.  This is when the whole experience became utterly disgusting. The manager on duty at the time, Christine, didn't so much as apologize for the confusion or inconvenience. She came up and half-heartedly asked about what was going on, tried to push some other dish on us, and disregarded the suggestion given that the servers should make the facts known about the dishes when they're ordered. She was supposed to be making it right with the person who was unhappy about their meal (not me). But when I had jumped because someone had laughed real loud (don't get me started on the acoustics of this place), she stopped midway through \"problem solving\" and tried to make a joke about how she had to look too because she didn't know what could be going on these days (in her own restaurant, mind you). When it was thrown out there that that particular meal should be discounted because it was now incomplete and missing one of the main components, this woman didn't say anything at all. NOTHING! She just rolled her eyes and walked away. She could have even said, \"I'm sorry; but I can't do that;\" and that would have been at least respectful. But, then again, she didn't even apologize for the menu being misleading, the fact that they couldn't make a simple thing like cutting a piece of chicken in half happen, or anything else; so what else could we have expected?  The only redeeming thing about this visit was the server, Joseph. He was fun, personable, charismatic, and he (at least seemed) to show genuine concern. If you still have to check this place, make sure he is your server."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here again. There was a dead fly in our macaroni and cheese. Absolutely disgusting!!!!! And the manager only took $10 off the bill. I've eaten here a number of times in the past but with this incident I will never step foot in their again."}
{"text":"My mom sister and aunt came to visit me from outta town so I decided to take them to Stonetown never again horrible service the waiter seemed like she was on another planet it took 45 minutes for our food to come out during lunch I ordered the catfish po boy and it was horrible truthfully it wasn't even made the way a po boy would be made but anyway I won't be coming back they overcharge you for small portions"}
{"text":"My boss and I went there for brunch. The fried green tomatoes tasted as if they were made yesterday. My eggs were literally cold- how could that possibly happen? My bosses chicken was so dry as were the french toast pieces that were pretty much inedible.  The only redeeming thing were the grits. They were good.  Also, the whole brunch was $50 (including tip)without drinks of any kind, only water."}
{"text":"Terrible place. We went in and waited at a table for 20+ minutes. No waiter came to our table, no one acknowledged our presence. It was terrible. Then an Italian woman with black hair and glasses (who works at the bar) yelled at us when we left and questioned if we lived in the building. We had to show her our apt card just to get out of the building. She was so loud, it interrupted all of the patrons who were eating. She was super rude and should be fired. I've never experience such bad service."}
{"text":"Although limited to a small \"late night menu the experience was decent. The actual menu you receive when you get there differs from the one posted online, which sucked.  The service was great. I wanted a combination of the \"kool aid\" & an alcoholic drink, which the waiter accommodated without hesitation. The \"fried green tomatoes\" and catfish fritters were good, nice light batter & fried to perfection. The \"buttermilk fried yardbird with red velvet waffles & grits was good as well, however the waffles were tasteless. The grits although being tasteful were a tad salty but nothing overbearing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly staff. Loved the feel of it. I got a pasta bowl with lobster and shrimp (can't remember the name but it was delicious) Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Zanzibar has two locations, one downtown and one in Shaker Square. I went to both.  I had brunch at the Shaker Square location and lunch at the one downtown.   I ordered the fried green tomatoes and the soul egg roll (I'm not sure that's what it's called). The sauce that came with both appetizers was served in a paper sauce cup, and I think they should do a little better than that. It was a little tacky in my opinion. The vegetarian egg rolls were my favorite. It was fresh, hot, and gave a mouthful of flavor with each bite! It was a little cheesier that I would have preferred, but I would still order it again. The fried green tomatoes were also hot and tasty.   I ordered the vegetarian omelette dish and was served toast with it because they ran out of biscuits at 1pm(when we arrived).  the omelette was pretty good, but the potatoes were my favorite. It was my first time having those type of potatoes and I honestly didn't add a thing to them! Just ate them while they were still hot!!  For lunch I had The blackened catfish with salsa over grits, YOU MUST TRY IT!!!! It was perfect! I've never had fish and grits so good before! I enjoyed every single bite and shed a tear when I shared one tiny bite with Lionel.   The serving size for both dishes were decent and not too large.   The waiter was very attentive and friendly! She also gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"This food was amazing!  Even down to the Kool-Aid.  If visiting Cleveland, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went in there because I heard that the blackened catfish was so good. So, that's what I ordered. Our waiter screwed up and had no idea what was going on (I think he was smoking crack). He brought out a completely different order and insisted that ordered it. I didn't. He gave me the fried catfish and i didn't want to wait for them to cook a new meal so i ate it. The food was decent but the server ruined the meal."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night before a Monsters hockey game. So it was around 6:00. It was not busy at all and getting a seat was quite easy.   I had been to the place when it was was Caddyshack bar. They redecorated quite nicely. Lowlight and the fireplace made for a delightful ambience.   The food was quite good. I had the chicken and waffles and the wife had the fried pork chops. Now they aren't called that on the menu. They have some other fancy restaurant names. I just call it what it is. The waffles were red velvet. They had the texture of cake instead of waffles. The fried chicken was on the bone. This is probably standard. I've been to places that debone the chicken before it is served. It was a little dry but not overly. Once covered in syrup it didn't matter. The wife said the pork chop was not tender. But the gravy and onions that smothered it was very good. Both entrees came with grits. They were very good. Not overly salted like I've had before.   All in all i was quite pleased and would definitely come back. They have no beers on draught but offer up a mixed drink menu."}
{"text":"We had reservations and were seated promptly, but after at least 10 minutes at our table no one came by. So we relocated to the bar hoping for service. Ten minutes passed and nothing. The food looked great but we left because of the complete lack of service."}
{"text":"Last night second time eating here and again service horrible. Meat is cold with hot gray. Cabbage waterey floating like egg drop soup green rolls best and kool good but cost too much for no free refill they must own Angie too they just horrible new store St.clair and Lee who takes food and warm it back up in microwave"}
{"text":"While in Cleveland visiting family I decided to try this place . I tried to get in at the downtown location but there was a 45 minute wait . So we decided to just call in a order to this location . First let me say it was very difficult ordering over the phone . There was so much noise in the background the lady kept having me repeat myself . Finally she put another person on the phone. Once the lady got our order she told us it would be atleast 30 minutes. First let me say the location is pretty but the lack of parking spots is a negative . We were able to get a spot right in the front luckily. We went inside and were greeted by 2 ladies . We told them our last name the lady said she would have to check and see if our food was ready . Well it had been over an hour already and she said our food was still being prepared . We waited around for a few minutes and another girl came up asking if we'd had been helped. She then says I think your food is sitting behind the cash register . She goes through the bags and it is our food . I think they are just a little disorganized. My jerk chicken and yams were good . My mom did not like their food unfortunately. My mom ordered the shrimp and grits and it was just about 5 little shrimps and a lot of grits . She was not happy . My sister got the chicken and waffles and she said it was good . The purple rain and sunrise drinks are great ! We decided to get them to go in mason jars for $5. Above all the place was really nice inside and the ladies at the register were nice . I just don't know if I would come here again the next time I am in Cleveland ."}
{"text":"3.00 stars after my second time there.   The decor is a little plain with plantation shutters and burlap sack covered booths to remind you of the south. The restaurant usually has old school music / movies playing in the background.  The fire and chess set near the entrance look promising though.    The first meal I had was during dinner when they first opened.  I ordered the catfish fingers, which were pretty plain/taste like any other fried white fish you can get at McDonald's and so was the creamy dipping sauce that went with the catfish; I won't get them again. It seems the chef wasn't sure what to pair the catfish so it automatically went with a spicy aioli? The catfish needs something slightly tart to break up the greasiness. I never had alligator before I came here and I can really say now that GATOR DOES TASTE LIKE CHICKEN. The meat is flaky and moist with a chicken-fish hybrid-like texture. The gator burger appetizers were delicious and I would get them again without the aioli (a bit lighter without it and it doesn't add too much to the burger).  I enjoyed the a nice brunch meal at Stonetown.  I ordered a Poinsettia to start, which was a little disappointing to the palette, especially for $7.00. It was similar to a mimosa with heavy grenadine, but less exciting (if you can call a mimosa exciting). I also tried a bourbon apple drink- a little too harsh on the bourbon, so much so I couldn't finish the drink.  I would say it would be a good drink, if you plan on just getting one and you have some water to wash the bourbon down.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The white meat chicken had a nice crunchy outer shell (MY FAVORITE!!), but sadly the chicken was a little dry.  However, I would rather have dry chicken and crispy outer shell, than moist chicken with a soggy coating.  The crunchy outer shell is comparable to fried chicken from Giant Eagle grocery store; lacks any uniqueness, but still embodies all the right spices. The red velvet waffles were somewhat plain and tasted like regular waffles with red food coloring. The grits were creamy and you can definitely taste all the butter that goes into them. The hot sauce as very similar to Frank's Red Hot, which seems to be a theme among brunch places. Frank's Red Hot sauce isn't bad, but I would love to taste a different take on brunch hot sauce. We also got their vegetable omelet, which was pretty delicious and loaded with vegetables (zucchini, carrots, onions, peppers, okra, etc). The eggs were fluffed nicely with just the right ratio of egg to stuffing.  The cajun potatoes were decent, not the best, but certainly, not the worst. We wanted to try their quiche, but sadly, the quiche ran out.  Service was a bit slow and we waited a bit to get through the entire brunch, especially since they were relatively slow- roughly 1.25 hours.  Brunch was pretty expensive too, we spent roughly 70.00 after everything.  At least the portions were pretty big. I would come here if you had limited options downtown (ie Sunday morning when every other restaurant is closed), but you can do much better at other restaurants nearby (cough cough East 4th)."}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner. Ordered the fried chicken and sides. Our food was brought so fast I was afraid that the server brought the food to the wrong table. The portions were large and the food was hot and tasty"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded me of Charleston South Carolina. The blackened cat fish was excellent. The greens were clean and nice. The grits were smooth and creamy. Porkchops were good down to the bone. Prompt service right before the Cavs game. Very hospitable people. Very personable chef.We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, if I'm ever in Cleveland I know I'll want to come back. It's hard to find fried crayfish that's not overdone or flavorless and I was pleased to find they did it amazingly well. High quality tails in a wonderfully seasoned batter that needed no sauce, but the remoulade that came with it was so tasty you'll want to use it anyway.  I just had to get chicken and waffles - red velvet waffles, whaaat? It was...interesting. The chicken was 4 full wing sets which were amazing. The buttermilk tenderized the meat perfectly and the breading was perfectly seasoned that it needed no sauce to be delicious on its own. Fried crisp to perfection, not soggy and not overdone.  The waffles were....interesting. Very savory, they used a dark cocoa powder and little to no sugar, so they were quite bitter with the buttermilk. Nicely cooked, crisp outside and chewy. Just not my thing I guess, next time I'd just get the chicken because it was the real star of the plate.  I asked to swap out the gritz for collards and I felt they were a bit sweet, I'm used to slightly bitter, smokey meaty collards with a slight spice kick. But they were well cooked, so I'll give them that.  My father ordered the Cajun pasta and was pleased to see two whole lobster tails, perfectly cooked shrimp, crayfish and mussels. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the spicy claim, but it still had an excellent flavor.  Nice ambiance. Loved the coffee bean sack upholstered booth backs and the rustic tables. Our iced teas were served in large mason jars. Service was great, friendly and not overly annoying given that there were only a few parties in the restaurant that night.   I'll be back for more fried chicken and crayfish!"}
{"text":"We must have been the only people not dressed up when we went because we had just come from the library. It was fine though because we just grabbed a seat at the bar.   We got the lobster quesadilla and the alligator burgers. The lobster was a little salty, but still quite delicious. The alligator, on the other hand, was just terrible. The meat was tough and smelled really strange. The taste left much to be desired. I've never had alligator before, so maybe I'm just not a fan of the meat, but my boyfriend said he's definitely had better. The drinks were also incredibly expensive given that we just ordered what was essentially kool-aid (too sweet and not very good).   The atmosphere was nice, but the bartender largely ignored us and our food was very slow to arrive. Perhaps if we were sitting at a regular table the service would have been better.   Overall, okay place to go, but definitely there are better soul food options in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love soul food so when I stumbled across this place I had to give it a shot.  I would give them five stars as I enjoyed it that much but my chicken was a little dry and lacked seasoning. My sides were very good. The grits were creamy and flavorful and the collard greens were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. They serve your drink in a 32oz mason jar. I got what they call a sunrise (Arnold Palmer)  I would totally eat here again. The service was very good  and my entire bill was $11.00."}
{"text":"Had an order of the fried green tomato BLT sliders, and a side of grits.  Overall it was good, but service was a tad slow for lunchtime.  I would definitely come back, but only when I have the time to sit around.  Not the best choice for when you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Our waitress was very pleasant and efficient. The food was served quickly and was very tasty. This is a great place with an excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to go check out this Southern food/upscale soul food restaurant on a Tuesday evening. We were struck by the really great atmosphere with good decor, classy lighting, and warm colors. 4 stars for ambiance! The service was very friendly and inviting too.  We got several things, including some items from the happy hour menu. They try to do a fusion menu, so things are a little bit different from the typical soul food menu. They also have fun, whimsical / nostalgic items, like kool-aid in mason jars.  We got the walleye cakes, shrimp and grits teaser, and I think the catfish. For sides, we got collard greens, baked mac and cheese, candied yams, and sweet potato corn muffins. I think we liked it overall, though my main issue (hence 3 stars) was that everything was super sweet, even all the items that were supposed to be savory! I had a hard time finishing everything because of how sweet it was. I think the corn muffins and grits were actually the least sweet.   We were really interested in some of the fusion items, like the watermelon BBQ sauce. The waitress was really nice and brought some over. It was gooood. I think we'd come back to try that out with some of the other dishes.   At the end of the day, it's a great restaurant for Shaker Square... just too sweet!!"}
{"text":"Well this is a very good SOUL FUSION place located in Shaker Square its a majority black working class to upper class crowd.I will say try the shrimp and grits or the catfish dinner.The place has a modern feel with a twist of the old south kool aid and mason jars which reminds me of the my grandma.The service is real slow and I wish it would get better because everytime I have been there it hasnt improved.If you like good soul food and want a decent progressive crowd then try Zanzibar I will be back in the near future"}
{"text":"Mannnnnnnnnnnn listen. Let me give this place a great review. Because this place is amazing. The \"Purple Rain\"(Lemonade & Grape. Yes, grape. For those that know what grape is this place is for us)drink was amazing. They serve kool aid here. REAL KOOL AID not the kind you measure the sugar for. I had the BBQ Salmon and it was bomb and their sides are off the chain too. I had MAC and cheese  yams  & greens  My boy had the fried catfish & grits  Im telling y'all. If you're in Cleveland this place is a must. And they have a full bar with Erk & Jerk as well. They have an amazing playlist playing and it's steps from the Q. I will be coming here every time I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stonetown is a more upscale take on southern-style soul food. Had lunch and tried several menu items. Nice ambiance and all of the food that I tried was delicious (highly recommend the soul rolls and gator sliders). Service was fast and friendly. Stonetown is a nice change of pace from the usual gastropub-type of food found all over downtown Cleveland these days. I recommend for group-gathering or a date as well."}
{"text":"I have a very huge family we have meet-ups and frequented Zanzibar 2 times in the last month, about 15 of us total showed. The second time on our family meet up we were late for our reservation, they were able to seat us all together but at separate tables which was perfectly fine.  Our waitress this time was not the best a complaint was made about her the manager removed her and replaced her with our previous waitress from the first time.  I wish I new her name I want to say Carla, she's very nice and took over with no bumps the food was great and we got it fast.  I apologize to others that say its loud, Zanzibar has an echo and my family can get loud at times... If it wasn't for that first waitress I would give 5 Stars great food drinks and fun!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with brunch. Read reviews on Yelp prior to coming and thought it was promising.  I am sure the dinner is what is worth coming for. I got the vegetable Omelet and it was ok but not worth the price I paid. My son got the yard bird and waffles. The wings were excellent but the waffles were ok. Not feeling anything else on the menu. Left full but disappointed. Probably won't revisit."}
{"text":"The restaurant always smells like dirty mop water when you first walk in. The food is low quality."}
{"text":"This place is on point. I had the Chicken and Waffles which great. The mac and cheese was flavorful and the blackened catfish had amazing sauce. There was soulful music, great lighting, and good vibes. Some of the menu items are more pricey than they should be but overall this is a place I'd revisit. Peaceful meal with a power packed taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service!! I ordered the red velvet waffles and blackened catfish. Both dishes were unbelievably yummy! The red velvet waffles were perfectly soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, and the sugar powder on top was just the perfect finish to a perfect dish! The blackened catfish was rich in flavor! I also got the sweet tea/lemonade! Price was very decent!"}
{"text":"Zanzibar is the perfect place to satisfy your Southern food cravings!! This new location is suuuper fancy! This place is ALWAYS super packed and so hard to get a reservation, but there's a huge lounge area next to the bar, which comes in handy when you're waiting for your table :) The menu pretty much covers any of your hardy Southern cravings. They have grits, fried chicken, various types of fish, just to name a few! I tried the Ultimate Feast, which is a great option for those who have trouble deciding between items! In this Feast, you get to pick 2 entrees. I got the salmon coquette and the porkchops. OH MY LORDY. The porkchop was super crispy, tender and savory! The sauce was the perfect level of saltiness. The salmon coquette was also very delicious! There's a ton of salmon in it, so you'll definitely get your money's worth :) I always get the Sunset (lemonade+ice tea). I love that it comes in a Mason jar! Also, I can't forget about their delicious complimentary corn bread! Blueberry AND sweet potato? YES PLEASE.   Overall, great service and food! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Zanzibar Soul Fusion has a very nice atmosphere and I really loved the wall decor over our table. The hostess and waitress were very nice to us and as well as the young man that brought the food to the table. I ordered the sunrise drink, it was delicious and a nice amount for someone who would normally order drink refills.  The chicken and waffles were also very tasty. I didn't care to much for the grits. After trying to doctor them up they were still somewhat bland. In all I would go back and try a few other meal options. There were so many tasty options to choose from."}

{"text":"The increased rating is because the food really is fantastic. Its everything else that I dont care for. My husband and I went for lunch. Since in the area and craving soul rolls.The place was empty. The server never told us her name but she was at out table every 5 minutes. First she came back to place the salt and pepper on the table. She came back to bring hot sauce that we did not ask for. Then she came back to bring my syrup for the chicken and waffles.Then she came back to bring the drinks. I swear im not making this up. My pop was flat, after seeing a full glass halfway through lunch, I would have expected the server to ask was my drink ok. Seeing how she was there so much.but she only asked my husband how his food was.  Last note- Zanzibar, please step your waiter/waitress training up. The food is too good for that to fail you."}
{"text":"Came in to town to meet some friends here. Again, I wasn't disappointed. Talk about good comfort food! This is the place! I had the blackened catfish. Wife had the fried chicken breast. We had the soul rolls for an app. All was delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was perfect!  The food was absolutely delicious.  My kids can be picky but, both really enjoyed their food.  Highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Food:  Excellent. (I had the blackened catfish with wild rice and black eyed peas.  Also, their corn muffins are legit.)  Location:  Excellent. (Shaker Square - love that I can take the rapid.)  Ambiance:  Excellent. (Never been to Zanzibar but this place has a cool, contemporary vibe that makes me think it's probably worth a trip.)  So why the four star rating, which should probably be three but the food was really good so I'll keep it at four stars?  Slowest.  Service.  Ever.    If you have time to spare, like our group of nine did, then perhaps this won't cramp your style but if you hate waiting or have somewhere to be, I'd avoid Zanzibar.  Our meal took a little over two hours even though we ordered right away and the restaurant wasn't that packed.  Granted, by the time the food came out it was worth the wait but still.  Step it up Zanzibar and you'll easily be a five star establishment in no time."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Ohio and I stumbled upon this restaurant on Yelp. I ordered the buttermilk yardbird chicken, mac & cheese, and greens for lunch My friend ordered chicken with velvet waffles. She ordered an appetizer as well, which unfortunately, came out the same time as our entrees. It kind of defeated the purpose of ordering it. The napkin on the table was dirty and the service was subpar. The food was at room temperature, but I wished it was warmer. I will come back and give it a second chance because the food was good. I just wished the experience was better. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Basically the whole experience sucked. The food was decent, but nothing to really write home about. The service was okay, had a few issues with the fact that our food took FOREVER  to come out. Basically I had to get up and find someone to go find my waitress to see how much longer it was going to take and get my meal. You can see the irritation on the staff's faces when I got up to ask about my meal. A waiter even ignored me standing there, while he was watching the game. The wait time on the food was based on the breakdown from brunch to dinner. Okay, that's fine. But a 45 min wait on food? Needless to say, I won't be returning. Beware to anyone that goes there. Slow service, for just decent food."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely setting and wonderful staff! Definitely worth a visit! When I made my reservation I didn't know the establishments name had been changed. It goes by Zanzibar Soul Fusion."}
{"text":"To our server Mary, thank You! You are the ONLY reason that I'm giving this establishment more than a one star review. You were attentive, thoughful, and just an amazing server. Zanzibar must know that you're irreplaceable.  HOWEVER, on Saturday, November 11th, I attended my best friend's birthday dinner at Zanzibar. This was my second time dining here. Since moving back to Cleveland in May (after being away for 7 years), I've been researching and looking for great dining options. In the past, ive heard conflicting reviews regarding Zanzibar but during my first visit I instantly fell in love.    However, that quickly changed during this second visit. Being that it was my best friend's  chosen locale for her birthday dinner, I didn't have the \"freedom\" to just leave if I was unhappy with the hostess/customer service. When I arrived,  we were seated in a small corner for a table of 7 (the reservation was for a table of 10). The hostess \"Michelle\"  then confronted our table about having too many people. My best friend then explained that no, our reservation was for 10 which was confirmed by a Zanzibar employee prior to our arrival. Instead of trying to remedy THEIR mistake, the hostess proceeded to blame us. Now, I don't understand whose to blame for the miscommunication but if the hostess would have showed an EFFORT to fix the situation, this review would be non-existent.  I can find good food anywhere. But I  only spend my hard earned pharmacist $$$$ on good customer service! I will never spend money here again, not even for a friend's birthday (sorry in advance friends)."}
{"text":"Stonetown is absolutely phenomenal. I brought my friend from Maryland here for a late lunch. It was my first time here too and I wasn't really sure what to expect. Their fried chicken was the best I've ever had and their drinks are wonderful! Tabatha took care of us at the bar and was the sweetest. We loved her! Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Cleveland ( shaker square) literally 2 buildings from this location . Initially i enjoyed the ambiance. The food is good and very nice portions. The staff is friendly and professional. The manager is very rude, not personable. On several occasions when my food has been incorrect the manager refused to fix it. I have ordered carry out on 3 occasions and items where either missing or cold and management refused to recook or prepare me another. Stating that the food was already prepared and he \"would not eat it\" ( the cost of fixing more). The  credit card machine is in operable at times. On another occasion i went and decided to walk in the snow to the bank  and when i returned they could not even take cash bc the system was down. which made me wait almost 40 mins to pay. i did not request a refund simply wanted fresh food. He refused. If you want the same food but not the terrible management go to one of their sister restaurants ( angies soulfood cafe). Angie's ambiance is not as nice but the same food and great staff.  i have given this place several opportunities especially since its in walking distance but the management have simply turned me off."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE !!  Another chain willing to take all your money and give you crappy untrained staff that are clueless at doing there jobs.  !!!!!!  Just because your there and putting food on my table does not mean you served me !!!!! Idiots with no brains. You do not deserve tipped. You should get another job.  Do not understand why other than location you get so busy.  Everyone says your management is terrible.  Have you seen your own reviews. Do you even care since you obviously have not addressed this problem."}
{"text":"I came across this fabulous place on a short stay in Cleveland. I was a bit skeptical as there was a minimal crowd. But much to my surprise The Stone Town restaurant did not disappoint!!!  Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place I have ever been to me and my friend ate here for lunch she is black and the waiter which is Hispanic was joking around with my friend because I didn't know it was something was on the menu and was like oh because you're white but your friend over here would understand because she's black and was like you know us black people which you are clearly Hispanic not black so I don't understand that just very rude and I will never go here or my friend the food was disgusting I can't believe we even stayed after going through all this being rudeness does never again"}
{"text":"Just enjoying a wonderful meal with good friends, for a Birthday celebration !!!!!! Our server Lonnie was excellent. He answered all our questions and was very patient with us. I'll will definitely be back.  Sandy"}
{"text":"Service = Outstanding! Food = Tasty!  We ordered the tempura lobster and fried chicken. Sides we got were grits and collard greens. All was tasty. We got the dark meet for the chicken order (2 drum sticks and 2 thighs). I liked it! I got my chicken fix for sure. The greens were gone in a flash. The grits were supper good too. Now to the tempura lobster... it was mushrooms, squash, onions, and what looked like a single crawdad. Not kidding! It was the size of a shrimp. I didn't even try the crawdad... I munched the other bits and it was very good. The plate though.. probably should not be called lobster tempura is my point. I felt a bit slighted by this... the reason for the 3 star.   Only things I think that would have been better. Draft beers and flat table tops. They have no drafts and the table tops are curved lumpy wood type so the plates flop around like they are on a little teeter totter. Also, the staff seemed a bit stiff or like they were not comfortable. They sort of acted like they were being watched or something. Our server did not act like this... she rocked.  Now the price. Its a bit high IMO but that's downtown for you. If you want this kind of comfort food and want it downtown I recommend it! But for me; I think Ill be going east about 3 miles to save some money on my future chicken fix's. I will be coming back to try the other entries here in the future though!"}
{"text":"The flavors are amazing... Came only to find out that I just missed brunch... sad cause the menu can be pricey for some... but I can tell you, you get what you pay for Not sure? Try the vege platter where you choose 3 sides ... we tried the yams, mac n cheese and greens.... all three were exactly what you would expect from someone's Grandma from the south ...   Also tried the Red fish with Spivey Creole sauce... warned about bones but worth the risk.. right amount of spicey and full of flavor   I will be sure to come back for brunch on time as I am going to get it is as good as everything else so far. Chicken and Waffles next time? Urgh now I have to wait"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I dropped by one of our favorite restaurants in Shaker Square and as always, we were seated very quickly and received excellent service and attention by our server! We highly recommend you stopping in for a great selection of soul food cooked just right!"}
{"text":"I attended a group brunch outing, in the priviate dining room.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the meal, especially after reading some of the reviews.  Even though there was a group of us, we ordered off of the menu and paid individually.  We were assigned 1 server for approx 20+ people.  Our server was very efficient.  I was sitting toward the back of the room, so after much deliberation, I settled on ordering the seafood quiche.  Well by the time the server approached me for my order, all of the allotted quiche for that morning had been ordered.  I was super bummed, but one of my fellow diners, decided to get the red velvet waffles with chicken, which released her quiche order, for me.  Our orders arrived a short time later, and for the most part  everyone enjoyed their good.  My quiche arrived with fresh fruit and grits, and topped with a creole sauce.  The grits were DIVINE, well seasoned and tasty.  The quiche was equally delicious and more than adequately portioned.  I had the opportunity to taste the red velvet waffles and as my fellow diners exclaimed, the batter was definitely homemade, because there was too much vinegar in the batter, not so much that the waffles were inedible, just to the point that we needed a little extra syrup to offset the vinegar taste.  The waffles were thick, fluffy and delicious.   I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"My first time trying anything soul food and it exceeded my expectations.  I ordered the lobster quesadilla, and it was YUMMY and flavorful.  The cornbread was sweet, soft and fluffy."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Zanzibar and I'm highly disappointed. The young lady who took my order was professional and polite and our food was still hot when we got home.. I ordered the bbq salmon and it was so DRY and over cooked it was like jerky. I've eaten here many times and I love the salmon, so I'm very disappointed. My corn muffins were crumbling and dry as well. The sides were good as usual but I'm so sad about my salmon! I could barely chew it"}
{"text":"Service was good,  food was good,  a little disappointed they didn't have the Mason jars but overall I was happy. I would return."}
{"text":"Had a very tasty, relaxed vegetarian meal today. Not always easy to find vegetarian Southern food. This place has it. I had fried green tomatoes and grit cakes. They also had other options including veg tempura, collards, slaw, salad, mac n cheese, et cetera. If you do fish, you are extra covered. Warm, jazz music filled atmosphere.  Complete with stone surrounded fireplace. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Definitely a have to do.... Very good.... our server, Harold, treated us right and had great suggestions. Purple Rain is a must have too. All 6 of us were digging into eat others plates to try everything and not a 1 was bad at all. Will be back."}
{"text":"A must try place for Brunch in downtown cleveland. Blueberry pancakes were the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great location, service and food. I had shrimp and grits with purple rain. Shocked I got in while the NBA finals were right across the street at Quicken Loans arena. Beautiful decor, nice environment and close to everything. This is a winner!"}
{"text":"Had the fish cakes and chicken sample entree.  The walleye fish cakes were great but the chicken was standard fare.  Service was nice and drinks were very good.  Went in at 5 on a Saturday and sat at the bar to avoid a 30 minutes wait."}
{"text":"I am truly amazed with how many people gave this place 5 stars!!! I've gone here twice. My first time was at the previous location and my second was at its new location. My first experience was ok. I had the turkey chops which I enjoyed and I also enjoyed the muffins and my appetizer (soul rolls). On the other hand my husbands meal was not good at all. He got the smothered fried chicken and it was so much grease on the chicken that it made me want to throw up just looking at it. He said it tasted awful as well. The yams had no flavor! Our waitress was very nice and did an awesome job of telling us what was the most popular things on the menu. I think what threw me off the most was the mason jars of Kool-aid! I can't remember how much they charged for this but if you are trying to portray yourself as an upscale restaurant I don't think selling me a jar of Kool-aid is NOT going to convince me! I can buy 2 packs of Kool-aid for $1...not a good look!  Now on to my second visit. I had high expectations for the new location. I was pleased while I was at the bar waiting for our table to get ready. We were seated and a nice lady came to our table and introduced herself as our waitress. Nice is about all this woman was because she was a terrible waitress. She took forever to come back to our table after the initial introduction. While waiting, I was looking at the menu and was shocked that they did not get rid of the Kool-aid, even after they upgraded their restaurant smh. They also had beef shank on the menu...really??? That's like the cheapest beef someone could eat and it's on their menu and costs the same thing as everything else (unbelievable).  When our waitress finally came back we ordered our appetizer and our meals. I also asked her could she bring us our corn muffins and she said yes. She disappeared again and finally came back with our appetizer and our food at the same time smh. Just because we ordered them at the same time it didn't mean we wanted them to come to the table together! She also forgot to bring the muffins. I had the fish and I can't remember my husbands entree. My fish was overcooked and our Mac and cheese tasted like someone pour a ton of salt in it! It was disgusting. We didn't come close to finishing our meals. When our disappearing waitress returned she just took our plates without asking why didn't we eat it, and she never came back while we were eating to check on us so we could tell her our meals were not good. I then asked her about the muffins and she apologized and came back with them not long after and we ordered dessert to go. She took forever to come back with the dessert as well. She brought us our check and we still gave her a good tip; I think because she was much older and nice. She took the tab back and immediately opened it up to see how much we tipped her (so unprofessional). When she came back with our dessert we couldn't wait to leave! Got home and ate the dessert later and it was disappointing as well. I ordered the sweet potato pie and I received 2 spoonfuls of what I guess came from a slice of pie! I should've looked at it before I left because if I'm not mistaken the \"slice\" of pie cost $5 which is already overpriced so to not even get that is absurd!!!   I will never go back to this place! I like real upscale restaurants and not pretend upscale restaurants!"}
{"text":"Why was i just on trial for having gross food?  Plus half the food came out 20 minutes later than the rest, they forgot a few side dishes, a dessert and even an entree but even still if the kitchen or waiter is having a bad night just be apologetic and polite about it. I've been in the industry before so i know how it can be but that was ridiculous...management was so incredibly rude even with all the mistakes.  The experience was just disappointing. Management just needs to be more customer service friendly. The concept was great and the hostess and busboys were helpful and friendly.... I won't be back but i wish them better luck in the future."}
{"text":"The food is good and portions are large, the service is so slow. It took so long to receive our entrees that the lady started to close down our section to get ready to close...we got there at 8pm. The pork chops are salty and the appetizers were kinda cold but still good except the fried green tomatoes- they were nasty cold. It was only one server and he was moving in slow motion so the food must have sat for a while.  Still good place to dine. Would go again."}
{"text":"If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, you may want to take your meds prior to dining here or go someplace else. Everything that I had was super salty. From appetizers  to entree, the primary \"flavor\" was salt. I ate pork chops, fish, greens, mac n cheese, sweet potatoes, red beans and rice, and house potatoes. Everything was hot and fresh and the portions were huge. I had several to go boxes for 2 more meals. The food overall was good and the Kool Aid combination drink was so sweet (and delicious) that even after adding a full cup of water, it was no noticeable difference in sweetness.  The soul rolls and greens and artichokes (tastes the same as spinach)were tasty and my server was nice and attentive. The hostess...they may want her to work in the back.  My overall experience was good. The ambiance was nice and inviting and the place was clean and neat  I didn't know I did a review on the one downtown 8 mos ago and said the same thing about the food being salty. The one above is for Shaker."}
{"text":"Went to the Sunday brunch and could barely walk home when we were done. At $20.95 per person (just brunch buffet, no drinks), it's not the cheapest place to eat on Shaker Square, but the food is so good you'll wish you had a bigger stomach. They bring you an omelette and waffle to start with, then you can go down the line and pick what you want from the buffet. I could only handle two plates of sausage and gravy, biscuits, collard greens, mac and cheese, and smothered chicken (there was also fried and baked) before I thought I would fall into a food coma. I can't speak for the other Yelpers and their sour collard greens, but mine were sweet and delicious, and I went back for seconds.  We had to try the mason jar drinks, so we got the Sunrise (lemonade & red Kool-Aid) and the lemonade & iced tea. The Sunrise was so good we took a mason jar home with us (it costs a little extra to take home).  TL;DR: Get the Sunrise. If you do the Sunday brunch (11am-4pm), it's $20.95, and you should clear your agenda afterward because you will probably go home and nap for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"I was here last night 9/13 for Birthday party. This was y first time here. It was THE WORST SERVICE I EVER HAD!!!! While waiting for our table which was suppose I be ready in 5-10 mins. We sat at the bar. The bartender did not greet us. She kept walking passed us closing out checks and serving other customers. After waiting 25-30 mins (not 5-10) we see two women walk in and get seated immediately!!!!!! So then we sat ourselves (now there were four of us including the birthday girl). The hostess said \"oh you wanted a table?\" Rudely!  Then we asked for a manager. The hostess brings THE BARTENDER (who didn't acknowledge us at all)  over, which was worse because she is horrible at her job as well.  We call the owner over and we explained how poor their customer service is! It's horrible! I would not recommend anyone to eat here. Unless you never worked customer service or have a book you can't put down because how shitty their service is!  Trying to  help a black owned restaurant but YOUR SERVICE SUCKS! Except for Courtney and CC  you guys rock!!!! They made up for our horrible experience."}
{"text":"went back for happy hour/dinner with a group of girls. i had the stone highball, which was spot on, and everyone else said their drinks were tasty too. had a bunch of sides including mac and cheese, veggie rolls, beans and rice, and corn bread. everything was yummy.  waitress was super nice, albeit a little awkward, and was really patient with us as we asked questions about the menu. i wish people would give this place a chance! i'd love to see them stick around for a while. every time i go it's super empty which makes me a little sad, but i think things will pick up for them over the summer. oh also they have discounted parking at the lot next door, for like a couple dollars or something. i've always found street parking on the block tho so no issues there."}
{"text":"I visited here for a graduation dinner. I have heard a lot about the place and was excited to try it. For the party they had light appetizers which were not that great. Small soul rolls, catfish fingers, and chicken wings the chicken wings were good, but nothing spectacular.  The dipping sauce they aljad for the wings seemed as if it was mayo with some ranch seasoning, it was thick and terrible. The dipping sauce for the soul rolls was delish spicy and good. I ordered soul  rolls off the menu as the small ones were not great but I like soul rolls. The were good, stuffed with chicken ,greens, corn and something that seemed like cheese. I enjoyed it. But what made me give them a 3 is the service. It was a large party maybe 30 or 40 people, it was only one server. He did ok until I asked for my bill. He told me \" it would be a while as the process was tedious\". I waited about 20 minutes and when he came back he still did not have my bill, when I asked again he stated he would go get it. I waited another 10 minutes, I decided to go to the restroom,  I find him at the bar making drinks. When I asked about my bill he stated that \"give me a minute it's a large party and everyone is asking for something \". He proceeded to say he would need to get his manager to get my check. After this process over 30 minutes I gave my cash to another member of the party and asked them to pay whenever he finally came with the bill, as I had another engagement to attend."}
{"text":"The soul rolls were delicious.   As for everything else was terrible. The chicken was over cooked and the Mac was dry and tasted days old. I could have lived my life without ever trying the food here."}
{"text":"Zanzibar Soul fusion just sounds good! Came for a visit and was told this was thee place to get great food and awesome Kool Aid. So I said why not? Got there about 12pm they open at 11am on Fridays and was seated and it was pretty bare. Veronica our awesome hostess with the mostess was great at recommending her favs and knew that menu like she wrote it herself. I ordered the honey chicken with potatoes and yams and hubby ordered orange roughy with greens and mac, For the place to be called soul fusion I was looking for the soul! Soul where are you? The food was so bland to me granted the jerk wing \"teazers\" were good but I just expected that \"this is better than my mommas cooking\" feel and it just didn't happen. Veronica was awesome the Kool aid had me dancing and doing the cabbage patch but the food was blah. The music in this place was awesome and smooth, Alicia keys and others anyway come here for the Kool aid and to say hey to Veronica but get ready to add the salt and hot sauce if you are down to try it.."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were in town for a concert at the Q, and we decided to get in a good brunch before we hit the road back to Pennsylvania.  I couldn't help but notice how quiet downtown Cleveland is on a Sunday morning, and yet several places were open for the few souls who were there looking for dining.  And souls is the best word I could use, because that's how dead it was.  We found Stonetown on my Yelp app and were seated in the near empty bar right away.    The hostess and server were friendly enough, but check times on the food ran a bit long for how slow it was.  I ordered eggs, grits, bacon, and a drop biscuit with a mimosa to wash it down.  My friend got the brioche stuffed French toast and a mimosa as well.  I must say, I was impressed by the grits.  You can't get them just anywhere, especially north of the Mason-Dixon line, but these were pretty near to the consistency I like and didn't taste like a packet of instant mixed with water.  The bacon and eggs were fine too, but the biscuit was a little on the tough side.  The mimosa was fine.  I had a bite of my friend's French toast and it was absolutely delicious; I would probably order that if I ever went there again.  But the going there again part is a BIG \"if\", because I'd rather find somewhere a little more lively."}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE. Our waiter was rude,clumsy and he was not attentive. The wait was 30 minutes which turned into an hour. The quality if the food was poor. I've had better soul food elsewhere. The greens tasted like soap and the chicken was over cooked. The pricing of the food did not match the quality or quantity. I was highly disappointed with the food and service."}
{"text":"Walking around on my layover today and found this spot .. Nothing like some home cook soul food with a twist . I ordered the chicken with the red velvet waffles delicious  Came with grits which I don't like but I tasted their grits and they were amazing ! Definitely will be back for lunch next week when I return ."}
{"text":"Worst place to go for large parties the manager was very rude and accommodating however the server that we had was very nice and try to help out I will never go back to the one out on Shaker Square again"}
{"text":"I've really been trying to like this place for years. I went there a few times in the past, one instance where I ordered a mimosa (which was on the front page of menu) and the waitress asked me what it was, then said they didn't have those until I pointed it out on the menu. Or another time when I went there for brunch and ordered eggs, asked for a side of toast and was told they didn't have toast... This is fine, but HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE TOAST?? How does a restaurant open for brunch not have bread? Like, what?..?  The latest trip here, I was informed that the restaurant/bar is under new management, and that these folks made it so there are no free refills on a $2 glass of fountain soda. Not even their employees can get a free drink or refill.(?) I know this is trivial, but who is making these decisions? It's kind of sad. This is a sit down restaurant. I actually think they are trying to run this place, maybe rebrand as something else.   Anyway, the food is alright, nothing spectacular - all if only you can handle the experience that is eating at this place. The bartender was also nice the other day so I guess that's good. Other than that, no thanks."}
{"text":"Stonetown is the only black-owned restaurant in downtown, a fact I can get behind. They serve the best soul food and southern cooking I've ever had in my life.   First are their special drinks with cute names- Purple Rain, Sunrise, Jolly Rancher- all some sort of Kool-Aid lemonade blend served in a giant mason jar. The drink blends are perfectly balanced and visually stunning.   The lunch portions were massive. I ordered three fried wings and they delivered three whole fried wings with a side of sweet potato fries.   The only bad news? Metered street parking that only accepts coins.   Besides that, everything is priced fair and cooked oh so well. Stonetown can expect another few visits from me."}
{"text":"My first time here. We had a very good waitress name Tanisha she explained everything on the menu. Our food was delicious. We loved the soul rolls. The Happy Hour on Friday very good value. Our drinks were amazing to. I will return."}
{"text":"Best food in Cleveland if you like home cooking seasoned to perfection.  Had blackend catfish on cheese grits with collard greens and cornbread... Excellent Wife had the fried chicken and fried green tomatoes were really good.   Highly recommend Stoneplace"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to get some southern cooked food!!!  The buttermilk fried chicken was some of the best I've had!!  My wife had the prime rib which looked delicious!!  Grits were amazing and the Mac & cheese was great too!!  A great find in Cleveland, and a must go for any foodie!!  Ask for Harold for amazing service as well!!"}
{"text":"Where our kin originated plays a lasting role in our lives. Our blood influences our faiths, our music, and our food. Our black residents still cling to their strong southern roots. Zanzibar is an  upscale restaurant serving southern style food to its target of African American Clevelanders. The facility is more like a supper club than a soul food joint. There is a busy bar, low lighting, a unique comfortable decor and very pleasant servers. Notable is that the African American women dress to the nines to come here and the white women dress more suitable for farm work. The whites also become irritated by southern time. This is what a waitress in South Carolina recently told me as I waited. \"Honey, your food will be along soonah  or lattah. You just sit back and doncha worry bout a thing.\" Hard for northern whites to appreciate southern time.  The food itself is similar to that made by your nicest aunt who was not the family's best cook. Any of the dishes could be better. I am not sure why since southern food requires few ingredients and simple techniques. I only know nothing I have had was remarkable or down home delicious. The fried cat fish has too much cornmeal for me making it hard rather than crunchy. I have had better sides from Glory's cans. But when I want southern food Zanzibar is the only choice. A few times a year I meet some friends here. We enjoy an unhurried dinner and usually find one dish to delight us."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the presentation is beautiful and they give you a great amount I'm full but I'm very happy that I get to take food home with me to eat throughout the day it's just that good I can't wait to come back to try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with good food. Parking is the only issue. We did ok considering the time of day it was. Stopping in for lunch and had a great meal. Everyone was friendly and well informed when we inquired about the other location. The decor is very classy. New Orleans themed paintings made me feel like I was in a jazz club in the French Quarter. The kool aid is outstanding I recommend Purple Rain (grape and lemonade) and the soul rolls as an appetizer. I had catfish and it was delicious. I look forward to coming back and trying other menu items. This would be a nice spot for girls night, date night or celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Zanzibar - everything from the food to the service was great. Out of all the food that anyone at my table ordered, the things that stand out to me as the greatest were the barbecued salmon, the beef shank, and the sweet potato pie.. mm! The corn muffins are delicious too. I didn't love the mac and cheese as much as I was hoping I would, and I didn't care for the apple cobbler so much either - maybe it just paled in comparison to the amazing sweet potato pie!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent!  If you  been there before and tasted soap in your food, just ask them not to put cilantro in your food, that's where the soap taste is coming from.  Great Service very attentive. Get the Purple Rail K"}
{"text":"One of the best soul food experiences I've ever had! Honey glazed fried chicken, sweet potato pie, and blueberry corn muffins were worth the trip only. AND service was among the best service I had at any restaurant. A must try!"}
{"text":"So this isn't my first time dinning at Zanzibar but it was my first time doing carry out which is why I'm giving only 3 star I ordered the catfish with the yams and max and cheese. Now my sides where delicious cooked to perfection but my catfish didn't seem done."}
{"text":"This is a nice establishment. I felt underdressed in my tshirt and shorts. The hostess and servers were very exceptionally pleasant. I ordered the soul rolls, grits and the banana blue pancakes. The rolls were perfectly fried and really tasty. The grits were delicious-I added nothing to them. The pancakes were large (which was great) but they were bland and the turkey sausage looked and tasted precooked. I sent them back and was brought out drier ones . The others at the table orderd quiche and chicken and waffle. They seemed to enjoy their food more than I was. Overall this was an ok place to eat. Im willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Great location close to progressive field. We didn't know what to expect. The word fusion scares me.   Loved the Hooch! We got the chicken and waffles. Maybe the BEST fried chicken I have ever had. Red velvet waffles? Delicious and different. Grits are worth the trip. Catfish was excellent too. Michael behind the bar was stellar too.  Great stop!"}
{"text":"Summary of star distribution: 1. Space/Staff, 2. Price, 3. Drinks, 4. Portion size, and 5. TASTE!!!  Took me awhile to visit Zanzibar, but lemme tell you - once I did, I was there twice more within 8 days.  First experience was a quiet Monday afternoon. I had some time to kill before watching Maleficient (Angie is the reason to watch btw), so stuck my head in and grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender was easy to chat with and quickly shared his favorites: catfish fingers, turkey chops, and the bbq salmon. These are three items I wouldn't necessarily gravitate to on a soul food menu, but I've learnt I don't always have to walk a straight line.   The catfish fingers were fresh, hot, and crisp that day. That Friday, a friend and I stop in for a late dinner (after 10pm) - the basketball game was on and there were a few passionate patrons in the bustling space. We ordered the pork chops and the turkey chops with sides of cajun corn and blackeye peas. We were served two massive plates of bliss!  The house potatoes, a rustic version of au gratin, were creamy and hearty. The cajun corn was juicy and bright. The blackeye peas were good, but nothing a little salt/pepper couldn't fix. The cornbread muffins were light and buttery. The chops were so good. You know the Pavlov's dog experiment with the bell ringing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning), well that's me - automatically salivating to the turkey chops (who knew!). Oh, we also started with friend green tomatoes, which were fresh, crisp, bright and simple (wish there was more though). The next meal was a few days later on the patio at dusk. It was another friend's suggestion, and I couldn't have agreed more. We both grabbed the salmon glazed with watermelon BBQ sauce and mojitos, and life was good.   No complaints. Sure we all need to add salt/pepper to suit our palates, but for the collective reasons enumerated, I will be back... but on occasion so that I don't take for granted the joy I experience when I have a meal there. Next time I'll kill a chicken and waffle..."}
{"text":"I only had drinks at Zanzibar.  I was so impressed.  The friendliness of the staff, cozy atmosphere and delicious drinks  were enough for a 5 star assessment.  i love Margaritas.  They can be hit or miss.  The Margaritas at Zanzibar were among the best I have ever had; maybe the very best.  I can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"MMMMmmm I'm totally digging this place! I got the fried green tomato sliders and the fried catfish for dinner.  Pros: *Amazing tender fried green tomatoes. The sauce is delightful, though it has a surprise kick, so beware if you're sensitive to spice *Catfish was perfect. Honestly, I couldn't have asked for anything different there. It was tender and flavorful *The grits are rich and buttery and have good texture  Cons: *The collard greens were underdone so they were a little bitter *The place was empty so it might seem a little sketch? The decor is adorable and comfortable, though  All in, I'd for sure come back"}
{"text":"What a lucky find!  In Cleveland from out of state and wanted something different.  This fit the bill.   We had gator burgers, fried crawfish, cornbread, salmon croquettes and peach cobbler. All of it was perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious!    After a day at the Cleveland Clinic with all the stress,  this was a perfect way to ease out of the day!   We used to live in the south and missed real soul food.  This was terrific!   Great people! Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"To be completely honest I saw this place had not so good reviews and had ruled it out, because let's face it... Who wants bad soul food? NO ONE. However I heard several of my coworkers suggesting it and a group of us decided to go.  Our server was excellent and the blue berry and sweet potato mini muffins they brought out before the meal were amazing!  I ordered Jerk wings and house salad with champagne vinaigrette but I had the honor of sampling some of my friends' entr√©es.  Everything was super tasty and seasoned really well. Two of the four people in my group licked their plates because they loved their food so much.  The only dish I didn't think was really good were the fried green tomatoes, they weren't bad but they aren't something I would order again... I've had much better.  Overall I would definitely say my experience didn't align with the bad reviews I've read. I recommend coming here and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"We took a group there for my birthday dinner and I could not have asked for a better experience. We all drove at least an hour to get there and it was worth every minute. Our server was phenomenal! She had a great personality and actually spent time joking with us and making it fun. We were so impressed that she took 7 orders without writing a thing and got every one right. The food is incredibly delicious and is true soul food! I had tried some of everyone's food and it was all delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food good service is HORRIFIC.  I had the chicken and grits which were very good but the service geez.  Never got water, never got silverware. The hostess had too take my order.  The food came out before the drinks and as of now I've been waiting 20 minutes for my bill.  I can't give this place more than 2 stars until the service gets better.  And the guy next to me has been waiting just to place his order totally ridiculous"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy the food in the service. If you're looking for at authentic soul food this is the place to go! The fried chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! My girlfriends and I came here for brunch and shared the quiche, blueberry banana pancakes and the fried green tomato breakfast. The service was great and all the food was delicious. The quiche was full of flavor! The ambience is so nice too. Very relaxing and they have a cozy fireplace with tables all around."}
{"text":"Two things to judge a southern style restaurant by:  biscuits and grits. I just had Saturday brunch consisting of eggs, pepper bacon, grits, fried green tomatoes and biscuit. Right on the money. The grits were authentic and I know, having grown up in SC and Mississippi. They were creamy, cooked right (not too much and not too little), and seasoned nicely. And the biscuit - light, fluffy and tasty, no butter or jelly or honey to mask a gummy biscuit or a stale puck.   Overall it's good. Just like the sister restaurants."}
{"text":"This Soul Fusion eatery and bar was a good idea. Our table started with the soul rolls, shrimp and grits, wings and sunrise Kool aid. For our entrees we ordered turkey chops which were Huge, catfish Mac and cheese, greens, large size pork chops with homemade gravy, sweet potato patty's and country corn. The food was so flavorful and our waitress/bartender Suzanna took great care of all 8 of us. This is most definitely a place I recommend downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm sooooo full (in a very good way) after dinner at Zanzibar. The fried green tomatoes were amazing, with more of a batter crust than the typical cornmeal. The fried chicken was AMAZING, as were the blueberry cornbread muffins.   Every single bite I took at Zanzibar was blissful."}
{"text":"Low stars, blah to that. This place rocks. They have a very lovely restaurant as far as decor goes, the atmosphere is very nice. Has an upscale feel to it. Can't go wrong for delicious soul food here.  Tried the fried green tomatoes to start off with, they are very good and on par with some of the best I've tried elsewhere. I got the sunrise to drink which is kool aid and lemonade mix. They have other fun options as well.  For entree had the chicken and waffles, a classic that I couldn't pass up. The delicious waffles are smaller size and have more substance to them vs a basic waffle. The chicken is very good and done the right way. Perfect crisp, not greasy, and has a great breading. The sides I tried were all excellent, had the Mac n cheese, grits, and collard greens.  Overall I was very happy with my experience. They have a large menu that I have to try more of!"}
{"text":"We come to Cleveland every two years for a family reunion. We have had lunch or dinner at Stonetown 3 times and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the fried chicken with red velvet waffles. My husband loves the fried catfish. The lunch portions were more than plenty. We will continue to stop here for a meal whenever we are in the great city of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was disappointing except the bathroom (which was very clean). My intuition told me to not eat here and I was right. The first thing I noticed was the soiled carpet in the waiting area. The second red flag was that Kool-Aid was a beverage on the menu. What quality establishment sells Kool-Aid? And then there was the food. The lobster flat bread, steak minis, chicken, biscuit and gravy, and corn all were quite unsavory and the temps were lukewarm. The collards were hot and seasoned well; except the serving contained mostly vine and veins and very few leafs. The meats were dry; like they had been prepared the day before and reheated. This place could use a visit from Chef Ramsey because it could use a serious makeover. It has potential, but at the moment, its falling short of worthiness."}
{"text":"James is the Best! He took time to say hello and make us feel at home. The food is divine and service is superb!  I will be back to eat and drink in the very near future."}
{"text":"Came to the soft opening before a Cavs game. The staff was friendly, it wasn't crowded so we got waited on immediately. I ordered the Zanzibar feast. It came with Cat fish, turkey chop, greens and house potatoes. I enjoyed each dish. The potatoes and grilled turkey chop are must trys."}
{"text":"Took about 21 minutes 2 have a waitress come 2 our table. But our waitress Justin Made up for it. He knew the menu, He had Excellent service he made our visit great. And food was on point. We will be back    Only part we didn't like they Gave us 6 wings for $8 lol good wings but only 6 they can give a few more for that price."}
{"text":"My daughter recommended Stonetown because she heard about it from friends. We went on a Thursday night and there was a light crowd. It struck us to comment about the unusual length of time we were made wait to be seated given the light crowd and surplus of openn tables. Once we were seated, however, the waitress was very attentive. Her service made up for the hostess; who obviously forgot about seating us.  Our cocktails were very good. But the food was somewhat disappointing.  I had the Drunken Yardbird; tasty but was swimming in drippy whiskey bbq sauce.  The mac-n-cheese was room temperature and dry. I didn't finish my meal. Rather than send it back to the kitchen, we became engrossed in our conversations.  Overall, I'd probably not list this restaurant on my favorites list. But it made for a nice place to just chill and visit with friends and family. And our waitress was a very cool, nice and attentive waitress.  First impression for me is mixed. I'm willing to try Stonetown again."}
{"text":"Soooooo amazing....at a loss for words! The catfish, greens, and Mac and cheese was delicious. The chef is a wonderful young man and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Although this was not my first time at Zanzibar's after last nights visit it will be my last! I took my daughter their to celebrate her 17th birthday and I regret doing so! Our waitress Tanisha  was extremely unprofessional calling people in our party \"Baby\" \"Boo\" \"Poo Poo\" etc. She got several of the orders wrong, took forever getting our drinks to us and tried to talk some of the party into getting more expensive items then they wanted. Then there were the flies that accompanied our food which our waitress Tanisha laughed off. This whole ghetto experience was not what either my daughter and myself were prepared for and her birthday was ruined!!!. Please do not waste your time here if you are expecting fine dinning from a professional staff,,,this is what I get for wanting to support Black businesses. Should have stuck with my first mind and went to Edwin's!!!"}
{"text":"My group was visiting from out of town and a friend suggested this place and it did not disappoint! The restaurant decor is very spacious and nice with a large bar. Our server promptly checked on us when we came in and was very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent! I had the soul rolls, collard greens and macaroni&cheese. The collard greens had a sweetness that was different but I liked. The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars is when it was time to pay the check the server took a little too long."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. We loved that they sell Kool-Aid in mason jars. I haven't had Kool-Aid in about 10 years. It was very delicious, and my son got to have it for the first time.  My husband had the catfish dinner with greens and also ordered the soul rolls. He liked them. They served them with a tangy sauce.  The problem was with my meal. I ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese. The top crust was burnt and it was very dry. It was completely disgusting. When I complained to the server, he simply replied, \"A lot of people like it.\" He also told us that it was frozen and had to be warmed up, which explained the extra crispy topping on it. The lobster was rubbery. I should have ordered the regular macaroni and cheese - perhaps it would have tasted much better. Perhaps we will try the restaurant again and just leave the lobster mac & cheese to Longhorn Steakhouse or some place like that."}
{"text":"Went there before a Cavs game on Saturday night.  Place was empty and it seems for a reason.  The hostess was very nice, said a server would be there to get us drinks while we waiting for 3 more to meet us.  Our friends showed shortly after and still no waiter.  We were there approximately 15 minutes before a waiter showed up and told us that a shipment of food hadn't come in and so not all food was available.  We asked him if we could order drinks - he said sure but he'd be back in a second.  He returned 5 minutes later with water for another table and then we watched him chit chat at the other table for another 5 minutes.  The table next to us got up as they hadn't been served yet either, and had been seated about 10 minutes after us.  We got up and left.  No interest in going back."}
{"text":"Very eclectic and creative soul food options matched with good service.  Trust the reviews.  My only complaint is that somehow it seems really easy to get bombarded with conversation from neighboring tables depending where you're seated and how busy it is."}
{"text":"Great dinning experience. The atmosphere is casual \"jazzy\"  but one would not be out of place in more dressed-up or business attire. We had the catfish & grits. The entree is served over a bed of collard greens. Contrary to my own cultural norms, Im not a big fan of collard greens and assumed id just end eating beyond and around the bed of greens. But those greens were so good, i did just the opposite!  I probably would have rated 5 stars but service was a little bit slow as is often the case with a new establishment.  Nevertheless, staff is customer-friendly and customer-service oriented.  I highly recommend Stonetown!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews that the atmosphere is nice and it has an upscale feel to it, this is why it got 2 stars not to mention the food is very very good. That is about as nice as it gets though. The service was absolutely terrible! I went with a group of 4 people and we had reservations. When I arrived and told the person in the front my name she said \"oh good your on time\" then walked away. We were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation when we went to the front to inquire about our seating after which we were immediately seated. Once seated a waiter came up to the table with no greeting but said we couldn't sit in the walkway, we explained that's where the hostess sat us and his response was \"she's new\". After moving tables the waitress that we got was none other than the person in the front who commended us on being on time and walked away. That's pretty much how her service was too absent, we never got refills, she brought out the appetizers after the main course and brought out the muffins after the appetizers. On the upside after complaining about her the manager did comp us 30% on the bill but honestly I would've rather had a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, service needs a little work    You want to eat here, the food will thrill you.  The service might make u upset enough to leave, but hold on.  They will fix it.  Came here on Saturday for brunch when they first opened.  They weren't ready for us, but my party was not in a rush so we eventually got settled.  This menu didn't have much of a healthy option so I did ala carte to avoid carbs.  I went with dark meat chicken and scrambled eggs.    My chicken was great, cooked a bit too long but it wasn't rubbery.  The flavor on the meat as well as the skin was phenomenal.   The eggs I did not ask for cheese on but they had cheese on them when they arrived.  I just scraped the cheese off though.  The eggs were fluffy and flavorful.  Probably the best eggs I have ever tasted and I don't even like eggs.  Again,  YOU WANT TO EAT HERE.     The service was suspect but they tried to make up for it.  2 others in my party did not want to eat their chicken because it was too overcooked but they brought out better chicken.  Everyone that ordered grits received the wrong thing, they fixed 2 the others didn't bother.  All the eggs orders were not made right either but they were so tasty no one sent them back.  If they correct their service issues this place would be a 5 star"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The servers were helpful & friendly. The food...it was disappointing. The food wasn't seasoned...I couldn't even finish my food & it was overpriced. Maybe I went on a off night? I may try going again soon because I really liked the service & the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Was at hotel and really tired raining outside and didnt feel like going outside my room.I wanted delivery I found and called Stonetown. OMG !!!! What amazing food I had, the fried catfish with collard greens and gritz and peach cobbler. Everything was seasoned well ...Soooo yummy I couldnt stop eating glad I didnt have to share...Being from Texas they definitely passed my southern taste test.The server Allen went above and beyond and my food soothed my soul.Thanks again and many more years of good food and success. Will recommend and be back when hungry in Cleveland."}
{"text":"mediocre to bad on all dishes paired with slow service. only got the second star for generous pours"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars bc i am extremely big on consistency in restaurants and i would prefer that you just give a quick disclaimer if the food will not be consistent for whatever reason instead of just giving the food to you in hopes that I won't notice as a customer. EXTREMELY annoying.   So the muffins are always good. Soul rolls are extremely good as well when they are done right. Sometimes they rush through your order and consistency/quality isn't the same due to their lack of ingredients.   Chicken isn't that great. The jerk chicken is way better (nice blend of seasonings when you eat it fresh). Mac and cheese is also good, although it's not as creamy as other MACS but you can still taste the quality of the cheese they use. The yams are deliciously sweet although depending o. When u go the could be mashed or sliced (again with the consistency thing). Either way they're good.   Kool-aid is crazy good! The best ever. Soulful pasta was also extremely delicious.   In conclusion this place is delicious and they have good food I just would want them to work on being consistent with the recipes and upfront if for whatever reason they can't create the same experience. Service is also good although food may be alil slow coming out due to high clientele at the moment but at least the food will be hot."}
{"text":"Will give this establishment another chance.  Upon my groups arrival we were ignored by what appears to be the hostes. Who has sat several others ahead of us that arrived later. I asked one of the groups if they had a reservation that group. They did not. The service at this place in my opinion is sub par. The appetizers arrived acceptably and tasted good. Our main course arrived very late. Again my group watch other tables food come out sooner even though we ordered prior.  We recieved our bill and in contained several errors which the bar tender quickly corrected.  My advice is the food is decent, service is VERY VERY SLOW  and the staff seems to be disorganized"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The service can be inconsistent, bad on 2 occasions, been there 6 times. The food makes up for it. The Drunken Yardbird is second to none, so tender. Mac'n Cheese is outstanding, Jalapeno corn muffins are also great, Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles as well. There is a parking garage right next to the place(to the east) and you can get a paid ticket for a buck or two from the waitress, even during Cavs games when the posted sign says \"special event $20\". Don't pay that, tell the guy your going to Stonetown."}
{"text":"Never ever eating here again. When this place first opened as StoneTown, my friend and I would eat here a lot before a Cavs game. We always thought the service and food were great. The last 2 times I've been in there, here's a menu but we're only offering this and this. Very last time the server asked how many checks for my friend and I, we said two separate. I ended up getting charged for both lunches, even after I told the sever he forgot to put my beer on the tap. Last time I'm honest. And last time I eat here. There were only like 10 other people in the joint. How hard is it to keep tabs straight?"}
{"text":"Went in after a painting class because I was starving.  Was told to sit at the bar. We sat there with dirty dishes in front of us for 10 minutes before we were helped.  Were waited on by bar staff. Placed our order. 5 minutes later, we were told they were out of grits. Okay, fine.  I still ordered the shrimp only with brown rice. I also ordered a side of Mac n cheese. When my meal arrived. I was then told they were out of Mac n cheese.  The shrimp and grits (brown rice) weren't good at all. I actually sent them back. Absolutely no flavor.  We sat there for about an hour and our waters were never refilled. Nothing to drink. When it came time to pay the bill, we handed over our card and were told we needed to come behind the counter to punch in our pin? Really? My husband had to go behind the bar to punch in his pin to be able to pay the bill. Who does that.  I highly recommend you upgrade your credit card system. Clean your restaurant and prepare enough food to accommodate until you close.  I don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"The soul roles are super good! Great place for fried entrees and a variety of fun drink options. Service is a bit slow, and the place is pretty busy, so expect a little wait."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly but that is pretty much where the good ends. Our food took very long to come out and when the manager came out to apologize and said it would be right out it still took another 10 minutes.   When the food did finally arrive, it was pretty much all luke warm and the French toast was not cooked at all inside. I gave it a 3 star because most everything tasted pretty good. Won't  be back though."}
{"text":"Was here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. She had a reservation but we were not allowed to be seated until at least half of the party was physically present....but they weren't even busy? 80% of the restaurant was empty. Mind you, this reservation was at 6pm, but we were not seated until about 7. The time in between was spent sitting at the bar, where were not ONCE offered a drink but were provided menus. Uh, gee thanks?   Finally seated..finally got drinks. The food was just ok. Nothing to rave about. The best thing to note was the gator burgers. Even that was just ok, but it was the best out of everything I had. I ordered the Louisiana Blackened Redfish- sounds awesome on the menu, but I found it to be subpar. Fish was overcooked (just a little) and the rice/sauce combo was much spicier than expected. Not sure if it had much flavor outside of spice and salt. The little cornbread muffin was actually pretty relish- very moist. I also had a side of coleslaw, which was drowned in dressing/mayo, and the cabbage seemed to be chopped, not shredded. Eh.   If you don't like fried food, don't go here because everything is fried (with the exception of the blackened fish I ordered). Fried catfish, tomatoes, pork chops, you name it- they fry it. And that's why it tastes good, people.   The only GOOD beer they had to offer was dortmunder. It was only saving grace in a slew of bad beer selections.   Service was SLOW AS MOLASSES. Don't get me wrong, they were nice, but seriously on their own time. It took us a total of 2+ hours to have appetizers and entrees served.   Bottom line: NOT recommended. I think mostly because of the way service is, they do not deserve business. Sorry for the tough lovin."}
{"text":"YOU HAD ME AT HELLO WITH THE KOOL AID ON THE MENU!!!.  We visited this restaurant 2 days in a row when we were in town for an international training event. One day was for pleasure as it was recommended to us. The next night for a team building event. Let me tell you when I looked at the menu and saw Cherry and Grape Kool Aid I got excited. I had a flashback to when I was young.  See you always have to make friends with Kool Aid (you have to be old enough to remember that commercial to get where I am coming from). The Sunrise and Sunset is a mixture of the cherry and lemonade or tge grapeThe chicken and red velvet waffles, the drunken chicken, soul rolls and other items made me levitate. The portions are healthy and the price was reasonable.  We had a group meeting here one of the days that was supposed to be for 30 that ended up being in excess of 70 people with another team joining us that I didn't know was coming. The staff stepped it up and accommodated us with a limited staff but a cheerful can do attitude.  The excellent customer service makes me want to add another 2 stars but YELP only allows a 5 star rating. In addition to our group the place had other customers as well who got taken care of."}
{"text":"I'm here now, waiting on someone, anyone to pass by to possibly refill my glass of water and correct my order. I'm in earshot of a conversation between a few servers about how there are too many of them working tonight. However, the extra hands aren't helping to expedite things. I stopped in for happy hour and just ordered apps. Food is decent, but service is slow."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place so many times that I need to. be an investor.   First, the food is beyond amazing. All of the items I've tried were flavored to perfection. Try the honey chicken, soul rolls and the shrimp and grits. These are my favorites. I'm so disappointed that they're not open during the week for lunch.   Overall, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While visiting CLE we tried the brunch. The owner )I think) was so welcoming to us and was very sweet. The service was prompt, the waitress was pleasant and the food was perfect. The Louisiana Quiche was delicious, and the Fried Green Tomato breakfast was a lot of food. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, but over priced. I think they care more about the presentation than giving you what you pay for. The portions are way too small for the price. The sweet tea is out of this world, very good."}
{"text":"The food is good! I get the fried catfish with collard greens and mac & cheese. The catfish is just perfectly fried every time. The sweet tea is very good and very sweet. The tea is never consistent when I go, but still good. The big problem I have is the parking at this place. It is so hard to find a spot in front of the restaurant. Also sometimes the hostesses can be rude and forget that you are waiting."}
{"text":"I went here in Cleveland when I was in town for a Colts game. My friends and I shared three brunch entrees. The Red Velvet waffles that came with the Chicken and Waffles were amazing and unlike anything I have ever had before. The biscuits and gravy were different but really good as well."}
{"text":"Dear reader,  Are you excited about experiencing some real soul food? Well don't be! This place is hor-ri-ble!!! A total disappointment to us black folks that love \"soul food\"! First of all I will talk about our server. Our waitress was Oceanna, she was great!!! She was the best waitress I had ever had, if you have her as your waitress she deserves a very nice tip! She is truly a lovely person.... We had a very large party so I can tell you a bit of what to expect off the menu.  I loved loved loved, the soul rolls they were the bomb and the side sauce that came with them was nice and spicy and added salt to them I was truly surprised. My mother on the other hand did not care for them. On a down side which is minor but I suggest that the restaurant invest in little dipping cups. It's so unrewarding to try to dip a giant soul roll in this tiny little paper cup that looks like something psych patients take their pills from. And that paper after taste is really gross, especially when you have to squeeze the paper cup to get the rest of the sauce out. I was afraid to ask for more sauce because they over charge for everything including $1.50 to substitute a side dish.  If you want to be on the safe side you might opt for the jerk chicken and Cajun corn for $10.95. I had this and it was not worth it. Go to the store buy some wings sprinkle jerk seasoning on them fry them then get some corn sprinkle pepper add red and green peppers and say you got it to go from Zanzibar that's how simple this dish was. There was nothing special about it, no personality,  finesse, nothing. They could have sprinkled parsley on it or something to liven it up. Just slop on a plate. The chicken was also dry, dry, dry, and came with no sauce and they needed it sooo bad! The teazer menu says that the jerk chicken wings came with a lemon aioli sauce but why in the world are these same dry ass wings missing the sauce on the entree menu? What? And I had to break down and add salt to my chicken smdh! Do you hear me? I had to add plain old white table salt to already fried chicken. So you say why didn't I take a pic? Because we made reservations at 7:30 for a large party we didn't get seated until almost 8:30. So by that time and me sending my plate back to get added corn and get drinks I was too hungry to think about it. I also ordered macaroni and cheese. ( let me say this, I am not a hater by far I have no reason to hate. The food does not live up to its hype! It is what it is) now, the macaroni and cheese...   Stick to your mother's Mac and cheese or you might do better just getting a box of shells and cheese lol. Maybe not but it's a tough choice. The mac and cheese was bland, no seasoning what-so-ever! They cut corners on the cheese so it wasn't that good old salty, funky, string, mac and cheese that I'm use to. They used too many eggs and the noodles were so over cooked. I mean seriously how, does a black owned restaurant F up mac and cheese someone's mama need to give or receive a serious beat down lol!   As far as drinks I opted for water and a drink called hooch fusion. The drink tasted really strong but I'm not sure if I got a buzz from it or not I sipped it throughout the night.   Briefly I'll talk about the other dishes that my family members and I tried;  Teazers:  The fried green tomatoes were on the small side and you only receive only five of them but they where so good. ( Dave's is right across the street if they need larger tomatoes)   Soul rolls were really good. I love them but I'll try to make them at home. Along with the hot sauce sauce.  Sides (supporting cast):  All of the food was room temperature and Luke warm.  The Cajun corn was ok just plain old tasting corn with peppers mines is better.  Mac and cheese was blah and pitiful.   Black eyes peas had no soul and they were blah and just boiled beans with a pinch of salt and pepper nothing else (no ham hocks people or smoked meat!) done oh so wrong. They were sent back.  Entrees: Smothered ribeye streak and house potato. The steak was nice and tender and covered in salty gravy and house potato should have been called white cheese au gratin potatoes. It was okay, the portion size is very nice but a bit too much salt for me.   Jerk wings so wack and gross. Dry and bland and unfulfilling. You  defiantly need an extra side and appetizer.    Center cut pork chops were also dry I'm unsure about the taste, I didn't ask.      Drinks:  The serving size of the tea and kook aid was a great size. Maybe worth the price you won't need a refill.  The woo woo nice smooth light colored drink   The hooch fusion strong drink with a snake bite   The maraschino cherries were gross!!!!  At the end of our meal the manager Shawn came to the table to greet up but he didn't stay long enough for us to be very honest with him.    Over all the atmosphere was nice the waitress was awesome and the hostess had red hair and look like she was ready to breast feed yuck! I won't be going back ever!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 20 stars if I could. I was in Cleveland on business when I came across this lovely place! Soul food galore! Blackened catfish with grits and okra, fried green tomatoes, fried crawfish, Mac and cheese, green, corn muffin...I could go on and on! Service is superb as well! I didn't even get a chance to check out the desserts but that will be on my next trip ;)"}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to give less than one star for a rating.  I hate long-winded reviews so here's my bullet points: -A lot of people working... Just not sure what anyone does.  -The tables are sticky and gross. There's no way these could pass the muster of any decent health inspector.   -After thirty minutes, we figured out that our server was no longer at work. Did she leave? Was she asked to go home? Who knows? We just know that she disappeared. My guess is that she stepped out back to smoke some crack.  -Staff was very sketchy and trashy. I think I may have seen many of them on the shows Cops, Jail, and Lockdown.  -Manager was apologetic and did offer us a gift card to pay for our drinks. We never did get our food.  -My wife's drink was so strong that she had to dump half a glass of ice water into it just to choke it down and she's a bit of a booze hound! -The food may be good but we never got to try it.  We will not be going back after this one very bad experience. The staff and the gross sticky tables are enough to make us never return."}
{"text":"My table ordered smothered pork chops, soul rolls, tempura lobster tail, chicken wings, and fried green tomato BLT sliders. Everything tasted great, our waitress was great, and the ambiance was great. I only have 2 bad things to say 1) nothing on the menu is healthy (almost everything is fried) 2) for the type of food they serve it is on the expensive side. So if your downtown and are craving soul food this is a good choice but you will pay for the downtown dinning experience"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Food was sic. That means #exquisite! I need a #sixthstar. The most filling, mouth-watering meal I have tasted in Cuyahoga County.  My main course was BBQ salmon with Cajun corn and mac & cheese. Appetizers included egg rolls, catfish tenders, and collard greens & artichoke dip.   Stop reading. Get in your car. And drive to Zanzibar  #rightnow"}
{"text":"Negative 1!!!!! Horrible & unprofessional! Would never return, nor would I ever consider trying any of their affiliate restaurant!"}
{"text":"Review from a local. I used to love this place, I'd come once a week for dinner and once a week for brunch. Then over time the food quality and service declined. When visitors used to ask me were to go, I previously point them to Stowntown, but no longer. The fried chicken is often dry and tastes likes it's been made in old cheap oil. The Stone Mary used to be the best mixed drink in Cleveland, but none of the current bartenders know how to make it and when they try it is void of alcohol. I know all servers have bad days, but the staff is consistently rude and short. Im friendly and  a good tipper, but they don't make any effort to be polite in return.  I would give it less stars, but part of me still likes to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Zanzibar was a wonderful experience. Errian was our waiter he provided great suggestions and was great. We had the Soul Rolls and Artichoke and Greens Dip for starters. I tried the Honey Glazed Chicken for my entree. My niece loved the Sunrise kool aid. I would definitely suggest a stop if you in Cleveland."}
{"text":"For awhile I was a Zanzibar regular, haven't been there in awhile and I definitely miss this spot!  I have had the opportunity to try several items off the menu... Start at the bar with the hypnotic punch or French kiss martini, both are tasty with a nice kick... For Appetizers, try the soul rolls, they are delicious and are a great way to start your meal. The greens and artichoke dip is a great bubbly, gooey, good starter as well and there is plenty to share. The jerk wings can be good, but I have found they are inconsistent in preparation...sometimes dry but they are delicious when prepared right... Moving on to the entrees, my favorite is the smothered pork chops, it's a large portion and the house potatoes complement it well, the other sides are hit or miss, the Mac n cheese isn't the greatest but will do. The collard greens are good and so is the candied yams. The other entrees to try are the chicken and waffles and the salmon w/ watermelon BBQ sauce which is tasty even though you don't taste the watermelon.  With the generous portions I haven't ever had room to try the desserts but overall Zanzibar has a nice atmosphere for a laid back soul food meal... And it's a great value!"}
{"text":"We really had a good dinner here.We came in right after the CAVS play off game and the waiter Steven provided excellent customer service when you go ask for him. The Manager was also on point and provided Good service."}
{"text":"My friend and I picked Stonetown as our indulgent brunch place, so we went all out in sampling. We started the meal with mimosas--very good! You could taste and feel the sparkle of the champagne. They didn't skimp on the champagne and try to water it down with orange juice; this was champagne with a hint of oj for color!   I decided to sample the quiche Louisiana, which was rich and the crust was flaky. Loved it! The seafood was the star of the show. It wasn't fishy and it wasn't overpowered by the the egg and the crust! My friend took half of my quiche as payment for eating half of her fried green tomato breakfast. We were brave and ordered the gator sausage-which I highly recommend! Get the gator sausage! Other stars of the breakfast were the biscuits and the fried green tomatoes.   Finally, we decided to get the red velvet waffles as a type of dessert. They were good-crisp on the outside, soft on the inside-but I was disappointed that they tasted just like normal waffles. I couldn't taste any red velvet!   Glad I came and I'd come back for biscuits and gator sausage and a mimosa, but there are other brunch places in Cleveland to try first!"}
{"text":"I was reluctant after seeing some negative reviews, but I was staying so close and I LOVE soul food.  Had to give it a try....  Juan was great behind the bar.  The service was spot on.  The manager checked in to see how everything was too.   I had the fried green tomatoes and the shrimp and lobster with grits cakes.  Tomatoes were great-- spicy sauce on the side and they came out hot and crispy.  The shrimp and lobster was really good too.  Smoky, flavorful sauce and delicious shellfish.  Usually in a dish like this its easy to get shellfish thats WAY overcooked.  Not the case here.  The shrimp and lobster were tender and cooked just right.  The sauce was a little heavy on the salt, but it didn't stop me from cleaning my plate.  I didn't mention it to the staff because I don't like doing that, especially if I'm still eating and enjoying the dish but I'm positive they would have bent over backwards to fix it had i asked.    Hot boozy cider for desert-- Yum!  For those of you who aren't the uber-finicky yelpers who complain that the bathroom was low on hand soap or that the lighting was too bright, or too dim (neither of which was the case here) give this place a shot.  I can tell they aim to please, and they succeeded!  I'm pleased!"}
{"text":"I was walking in from the cold , and saw the words bread pudding , fried catfish , I was hungry  , I came in from the cold , I was greeted by the server , very nice person ,very welcoming  .  I sat, looked over the menu , the server came over and brought me water and I asked for coffee , it came hot and very good .  I ordered the fried pork chop , I asked what sides where good , she said the mac and cheese ,  my meal came out and first thing was to dig into the mac and cheese , that whole meal was amazingly great just the right portion and so comforting , I felt like I was eating in someone's house , needless to say I didn't not order desserts , I am a pastry chef , I never order desserts.... Best casual meal in Cleveland ..."}
{"text":"Despite having a classier menu, it has a distinctly sports bar feel to it somehow, and I'm not even sure how.  I don't even know if they had sports on the TV.    We went during Sunday brunch, and the food was pretty decent, but nothing overly special.  My wife's seafood quiche was far more remarkable than my eggs and bacon breakfast.  For hers, the $11 or so seemed like a pretty good value, but mine was less amazing.    It was a decent meal before the ball game, but nothing I'm probably going to remember forever.  Service was pretty decent, but sporadic."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited for this place and I absolutely adored the decor/vibe when I first walked in. There was seating by the door while you wait for your table and a good sized bar right up front. To the left there were tables and booths placed strategically to give some privacy while still dining around other people. I liked this. We were placed toward the back at a table for two and waited about ten minutes or so for someone to come up to ask us about drinks. By that time we had looked over the menu and basically decided what we wanted. I liked the variety in their menu and the options for smaller bites if you didn't want a huge meal. Their dessert menu sounded aaaaamazing even though I didn't order any...this time. Sweet potato pie? Um, YES!  I got coffee for my drink and since they didn't have iced coffee I just asked for a glass with ice to pour my coffee over it. I thought it was good. For my main meal I got a salad with jerk seasoned chicken and a side of italian dressing. I thought it was okay..not really something that stands out. The chicken didn't have as much flavor as I had imagined it would with jerk seasoning. My plate had lettuce, tomato slices, cucumber slices, and chicken. It came with two slices of bread on the side, which I didn't eat. I thought I would have a few other things in my salad to make it more festive and diverse. It filled me up though so that was a plus. My friend got grits (must try next time) and chicken and waffles. I tried a piece of chicken and it tasted great! Definitely not dry.  Our waitress was friendly and appeared to have great knowledge of the menu, which I did appreciate. She brought us blueberry and cornbread muffins. I didn't try them, but they smelled great and looked delicious. Overall, I'd like to come back and try some other things on the menu. They're not known for salad so I should obviously try something they're more known for. My friend mentioned their grits were really, really good so I have to try that for sure. I'm not discounting this place and I would happily come again."}
{"text":"My lovely and I went here on a date last saturday to try something new. Boy was this new and nothing like anything downtown. The Bayou pasta was exactly like I would have made it at home only way better. We lived on the edge and tried the alligator burgers. WOW what were we missing. Alligator, man it does not taste like chicken at all. It has its own taste and it was something wonderful. The music was not too loud and not lame. It would be a perfect place to take a date or your family."}
{"text":"We were the only non black family in the restaurant as far as we could see. It made not difference. Everyone was kind and charming and the food was excellent. Will come again!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant with some out of town family that wanted soul food.  There was no hostess so we sat ourselves and it took a good ten minutes to be noticed at the table.  We placed our food and drink order about 7:00pm, there were eight of us at the table and only one person ordered an alcoholic beverage, a beer.  It took the waiter 20 minutes to deliver our drinks.  We finally got served our food at 8:30pm.  If we were not with family that was out of town, we would have walked out long before our food came.  There was about four other tables in the restaurant with us so it wasn't like the kitchen or the wait staff were overwhelmed with people.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  Not everyone at our table enjoyed the food and the table behind us was complaining to the manager about the food.  We will NEVER return here."}
{"text":"I stopped into Stonetown today for brunch before leaving Cleveland.  The food was so filling and delicious. And the service was great. My friends and I were greeted very warmly upon entering. Even after we had finished eating and paying for our meals, the staff did not rush us to leave at all. I enjoyed the delicious Louisiana quiche with gator sausage and low country grits. And the Sunrise drink was amazingggg lol I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have yet to be disappointed! The food is great and the atmosphere is nice. Highly recommend. I've had the the orange roughy both the po boys and filets. And the red velvet chicken and waffles both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Yum! I ended up here after a random fashion show event I attended at the Arcade. Stonetown was right now the street, open, and had alcohol. So obvvvviouslyyyyyyy away we went. Items ordered were Fried Green Tomatoes BLT, Orange Roughy Po'Boy, and one dish that I cannot remember for the life of me................. PLUS ALCOHOL! See the photos I uploaded :)  Definitely tasted mostly southern to me, not so much fusion. But I have no problem with that! I loved my Po'Boy, and the BLT was delicious. Sides were also a great addition to the meals, namely the mac and cheese. All three of us really enjoyed our food. We also loved the service. We seriously had four different servers and the manager interacting with us, which was hilarious."}
{"text":"Slow service and server had a bad attitude. Then, food was served cold and manager charged my guest 1.00 for eating the chicken wing. If I could rate this place a 0 I would."}
{"text":"This is a fun, place with a nice selection of craft beers of draught/draft.  This locally owned establishment has a creative menu that offers something for all in the group."}
{"text":"CC Our server was very Attentive and Well Mannered.The Food was Ok I enjoyed The Crawfish Fritters and the Tartar Sauce was Delicious.Menu needs Revamping Too Limited Needs More Entre? Choices!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was amazing!! We loved the food and excellent service!! We will definitely be back!! Great location"}
{"text":"The decor is upscale with a neutral pallet of browns, tans, and whites.  The staff is friendly and if something isn't right the manager is very accommodating.  I had the fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles, and a side of the baked mac and cheese.  Everything was well seasoned.  I didn't have to add any seasonings to the grits that came with the chicken and waffles!  Truthfully I was full when I decided to try the mac and cheese and despite my fullness I ate all the mac and cheese because it was that good!  Why four stars instead or five? I sat at the bar and had the wonderful  pleasure of hearing ALL the details of the bartender's weekend.  It was not a story appropriate for work.  It also took 5 minutes to get syrup for my waffles.  Not exactly a big deal until you realize your food unnecessarily cooled down because you had to wait for the syrup to eat it."}
{"text":"AMAZING......Totally impressed!  The food was awesome. We were drawn in by the Green Tomatoes. We ended up trying just about every appetizer on the menu. HOWEVER...NOTE TO THE OWNERS...as great as the food was we gave 4 STARS to CAMILLE & HAROLD for making our visit from Chicago feel like home."}
{"text":"Unfortunately,  I have to agree with the other negative reviews. Service was slow, even though the restaurant was empty and our food and drinks were...lets just say we would have been better off eating and drinking at the arena since we were headed to a Cavs game. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered the buttermilk fried yard bird. it was okay not the best. it was seasoned very well but very dry. I don't  if it was fried before and sat under a heating lamp but it was dry none the less also got grits which were pretty good, mac and Cheese which was just okay( but i must admit i have never had good mac and cheese anywhere) and a side salad.  I had The sunrise ( Kool-aid  and Lemonade) it was wonderful. The decor was very nice and the waitress was nice too. I don't know if i will be back but since I am the unofficial food critic for my downtown office I may give it another try soon"}
{"text":"I love the beauty of the people and atmosphere when you walk in Zanzibar. When I came to Zanzibar about 3 years ago they had a gnat problem--- I mean, gnats visible flying and sitting on walls. Unfortunately, when I visited today, there was a gnat in my water (now how is that possible?) So disappointed. I won't be coming here anymore. The food is good but I don't want to have to investigate if my food has a gnat Cooked in it Or my drink has gnats in it"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the place was great.  The waitress was great.  The food was bad.  Everything was real dry especially the mac and cheese. The catfish had bones.  My daughters plate came when everyone was half way dine with their meals."}
{"text":"So where do I begin! I was so excited to finally go, but to my surprise it was a huge disappointment. We sat down and waited 15 mins to finally meet our horrendous waitress. We ordered 2 appetizers to begin with and waited about 2 hours to finally get them. And once we finally received the appetizers our entrees came out at the same time. Needless to say the service was absolutely horrible! This was my FIRST and LAST time I'll be attending this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place by chance and we have mixed thoughts about it. The service was great- the staff was friendly and seemed to know about the food which is always a plus by my book.   My friend had the fried chicken with red velvet waffles and that was delicious. I tried the shrimp and lobster with fried grits and it wad a total rip off. For a $18 entr√©e, I was expecting more than one piece of lobster and two shrimps with two giant pieces of grits. Flavor was mediocre so the dish really had nothing going for it. Definitely a turn off and will not likely go back for that reason."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The food was not worth the price. We got fried crawfish and it was not hot, very small portion. The drink was ok."}
{"text":"This really hit the spot. I'm not sure my arteries feel the same way, but I enjoyed my meal here. I was Cleveland for training and luckily my classmates were foodies. We stopped here after class one night and loosened our belts for what was to come.  I went with the classic chicken and waffles with a side of grits. \"would you like cheese on your grits?\" Hell, yes!  My chicken was a bit on the dry side but the breading was an amazing crunchy blend of spices and crunchy corn meal. Yum! The waffle was delicious with  a touch of vanilla. The grits were some of the best I've had. Service was slow. Very slow at times. But when our waitress did show up she was so sweet and personable that it was difficult to let the delay discourage me. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing find! We had a party of 6 and came here on a rainy Sunday a few days ago. Found it on Yelp and decided to give it a try! It did not disappoint! Quick service and the food was spectacular! Best grits I have ever had! I'm not a huge pancake fan, but these pancakes were crispy on the edge and very satisfying! Will definitely come here again!!!"}
{"text":"The owner is one of the coolest women I have ever met. The food was delicious. The drinks were refreshing and tasty. I love soul food, and I also love alligator. This place has both! The ambiance is pretty amazing. I came here for Brunch and I am so glad I did. I plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"No refills on soft drinks. Huh? Waited 30 minutes for a reservations. I thought reservations were made so you didn't have to wait. No room for ppl to sit down as they waited. Meet a couple who waited an hour for a Togo order,please step it up. Waited 15 minutes for water once I was seated. This once was a place I loved to dine at and it has competently turned and not for the better."}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations based on a recommendation from a co-worker. We showed up about 30 minutes early, 5:30 on a Saturday, and were seated right away. The service was great and the food was AMAZING. We started with the Soul Rolls, which were recommended and so delicious. I had the fried yard bird with grits. Best fried okra I have ever had - seriously. My husband has the fried pork chops and also enjoyed his meal. We couldn't finish everything on the plate. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Glad I stopped in! Camille was the best her energy was 100! A must place in downtown Cleveland"}
{"text":"Ate here last week Friday after visiting the Cleveland Art museum. The place was decorated nicely, my first encounter was with the lady at the door, wasn't too pleasant....but anyways meet a few friends here for a late dinner  The food was great, expected for my Salmon croquettes, outside texture was a lil too toasty for me & wasn't feeling the gravy sauce, but the Honey Glazed Fried Chicken was awesome!! And so was the Mac & Cheese. Our waiter was nice, so the service was good...only bad thing was the table behind us was very loud & annoying...they were out celebrating a birthday, so it was very hard for my party to enjoy dinner & talk!!  Overall, I do plan on coming back cuz I cannot stoping thinking about the Honey Glazed Chicken!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here during our vacation.  The staff was excellent and very friendly.  The food quality was outstanding.  I felt it was too pricey, but delicious.  The blackened catfish was second to none.  The ambiance was superb.  This establishment was the perfect combination of upscale meets Sunday dinner at Grandma's.  I loved this place."}
{"text":"The staff was amazingly friendly. And the KFC honey glazed chicken was bomb. I recommend getting the dark meat"}
{"text":"Full disclosure. Its African American owned which along with its reputation was what initially drew me to it. I try encourage membera of my culture especially to frequent these establishments, espcially of the food is awesome because its great for the community to always have flavor. Its one less Bistro or Gastropub ya know? Anywho. Its essentially as Soul Food/ Comfort Food locale so your going to taste the time honored tradition in every bite. I dig it deeply. My date and I spent about $40, but the service was so outstanding it  commanded us to spend liberally. I purchased the Blackened Catfish and the Purple Rain with a shot of Vodka. It was perfect. The meal itself was a great size and appropriate portion, and the Catfish was perfect. Well cooked and the grits. Please. Please. Please get the Grits with it. Thank me later. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food. TERRIBLE service. 2/3 visits. I always get salmon croquettes that are yummy and shrimp and grits!!! Food taste so great... Alcoholic drinks are on the weak side. Last two times I've been the waiter always forgets to take our order and our comes out late. Food is too good to stop going."}
{"text":"Excellent place with very nice staff working. The place looks beautiful and they have amazing food. Got this grape kool aid with lemonade which was divine. The food was amazing the workers were extremely cool and friendly. I highly recommend this place to try new and interesting things! :)"}
{"text":"I originally ordered the BLT sliders w/ a side of mac & cheese but they brought me the gator sliders. I didn't notice it until after I took my first bite. It was delicious! Was my first time having gator. Luckily it was delicious so I didn't have them make my original order.   My boyfriend ordered the fried wings with cornbread. It was fried very well and the corn bread was good too.  What was the happiest surprise was a drink called Purple Rain. Grape Kool-aid with Lemonade. DELICIOUS! I would go back there just for that!  The atmosphere was laid back and they played a lot of classic 90s r&b hits. Was a fun time! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great soul food ! What restaurant sells kool aid ? Lol  The atmosphere is very calm  I love it !"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the food was BANGING. So if your only real concern when choosing a place to eat is the food, than come through!   My reasons for 3 stars are more based on service and atmosphere. I entered the restaurant and was immediately greeted with the smell of dirty mop water. I am sure a simple changing of mop heads and a thorough cleaning of the restaurant would solve this problem. Nonetheless the smell was prevalent throughout the entire experience.   We were a little early for our reservation so we had a drink at the bar. Only one other couple was sitting at the bar at the time and ordered simple drinks. So we ordered a cosmo martini and vodka soda. It took 10 minutes for us to get our drinks because my guy was making them one at a time. I was confused for real but I still tipped him well and went about my business.  I literally just sat down from waiting for our drinks, and the server instantly shows up to ask if we are ready to order. My jacket is still on! But it was cool I told her we'd be ready in a few. Aside from that she was super on point and really kind.   The smell and atmosphere was still a problem for me because we were sat at a booth that was dirty and torn up. The smell was still wafting throughout the entire establishment, and there just seemed to be a general lack of care amongst the staff.  As a ten year veteran of the serving and bartending business... a simple training of staff and cleaning of the restaurant would do wonders for this place. It truly takes away from the quality food when you're smelling dirty water the whole time. I want to say I'd return but I would be hard pressed at this point as I can get similar quality soul food at some other establishments in the area."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a 5 star rating, the food was great I had the turkey chops smothered in gravy and greens with a sunset(tea and lemonade). Visiting Cleveland from NJ I wasn't sure if I would find soul food restaurant that I would love, but from the moment we were seated we were pleased, our server James was excellent, our food arrived in great time......I will most definitely be making a visit or 2 back to this restaurant before I go back home to New Jersey!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, nice patio, loaded menu great appetizers, okay entree.  Had the fried green tomatoes, and artichoke dip and collard greens as appetizers and they were absolutely delicious. I probably could've eaten then all evening! Ordered the chicken and waffles with Mac and cheese side, and I was disappointed. Not enough flavour to the blend, in my opinion. Dark meat on my chicken was good, though. I did fill up pretty fast, very rich and filling. Worth your evening for dinner though"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I was very impressed by Zanzibar. The servers were all very friendly and accommodating, all of the food was delicious (their fried chicken is so tender!), and the low lighting and dark brown interior gave the room a cozy-yet-hip atmosphere.  The only reason I'm giving them 4 out of 5 stars is that it was quite crowded and loud when I was there, but that can't really be helped. Great for a weekday date!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. Zanzibar is an okay place for Southern food. After traveling to New Orleans this year and eating the food there... it's kind of hard to come back and compare the food.  My friend invited me to go to happy hour with her at Zanzibar so I agreed. Shaker Square is so quaint, I do enjoy frequenting the area from time to time.  She tried her first hurricane-NOLA style...eh, not that good, made way too strong.  We decided to try a whole bunch of dishes: the catfish po' boys (they were probably the best dish- I really like po 'boys..), the jerk wings (okay), the collard greens (not so much), and the grits. Meh.   I thought the atmosphere of the place was super nice though- kind of classy, dark lighting, chill place to go. But Southern food? Meh... it was okay. Just okay."}
{"text":"I hate to do this to a black business, but seriously.. I wish stonetown would do better. I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles with grits and I swear it seemed as if every single item was a reheat. The waffles were gross, but the chicken was good. Even though the chicken didn't taste bad.. it was quite obvious that it was \"old\" and reheated. If I'm paying \"sit down\" prices then I expect for my chicken to be dropped fresh.. and I'm pretty sure it doesn't take more than 2 minutes to make a miniature waffle. Ugh... maybe I'm missing something and they're now advertising as being \"fast food\" with a bar.. but I just wish the freshness could match the flavor."}
{"text":"This place is PRETTY good! I don't know about the new restaurant but the old one that I've been to 2-3 times has always pleased me. The food is very soul food. Yes that's what i'm looking for. The fried catfish was just perfect - not too cooked but properly deep fried enough to be called fried. The shrimp and grits was awesome as well - very big portion and filling. You get your corn bread and a side dish if you order a full meal, which is a good deal cuz it's a lot of food and their corn bread is just really soft and right on your g spot.  In the summer, you can also sit outside in the patio - although cleveland doesnt have a lot of nice cars driving by but it's pretty relaxing.  One thing that i didnt like that much about this place is their service speed. They are pretty slow so be prepared to spend a decent amount of time there for a meal. When you are in a rush, probably not a good idea to go there."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a group of 5 and some of us ordered different lemonade-kool aid drinks (sunrise/sunset) - SO GOOD! They even came in a mason jar that you could take to go. That was probably the highlight of the experience. My friend from Georgia was amazed by her soul-food dish (mac and cheese and sweet potato). Otherwise, service was very slow and the food was just alright with me. Don't go if you're in a hurry - we were there for nearly an hour and 30 minutes when our checks arrived."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try because it belongs to a family friend. Restaurant is nice, could use something on that big ass white wall. (A personal touch)   A little dead and you can definitely tell they are new to the game. Hours of operations are all over the place. I called ahead to ask about hours once we got there it was a different story. Had to look at a lot of dirty tables. Literally took about 30min to get our waters refilled (Restaurant was not busy at all). Servers would disappear, nowhere to be found.  Food was just ok. A little on the high side for the quality. I had fried chicken,  yams and Mac and cheese which came with cornbread muffin all for about $18.95 was not told about up charge because meal originally comes with grits, which a little different.   Wasn't a fan of the chicken. There was nothing special about it, it tasted old and reheated. They didn't have a few things we was asking for from the menu. The soul rolls were Delicious! I had 2 orders. Yams were on point.   Would definitely like to see this place grow."}
{"text":"Although the food was good the manager chris or christina really needs to find another line of work. The way she talks to other employees sickens me. She is rude, arrogant and ignorant. I actually heard her yell out another employees social security number. Who does that. Dont think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice scenery.. Had catfish it was not bad.. Mac and cheese will sit on ya for a while (what's in it lol) pork chop nahhh.. Cool Aid drink a must try.. Not bad will try again for brunch instead of dinner.. Nice environment.."}
{"text":"I'll preface my long review by saying there's a decent chance you will get good food here, but you should only go if you have 2 hours of time set aside to visit.   I tried to love this place but to be honest the people who gave it good reviews must be very patient. I've been here about 4 times and this last time was the nail in the coffin for me. Cleveland is known for its food scene but lacks in the area of soul food... Which is why I tried so hard to like this place (and its sister restaurants). I just can't tolerate the horrid service and lack of decent management. The first few times I went the food was amazing!! The service has never been good though. Not once for me. The wait staff is slow and inattentive even when the place isn't busy. I've never had the same waiter more than once so it's clear that the laziness is just part of the culture. This last time I went for brunch and only picked it because they had signs posted about the new management. I thought maybe just maybe they had fixed their issues with service. I could not be more wrong. The service was worse!! It took forever for the waiter to come to our table and over 45 minutes just for us to get our food. Which is insane in any regard but made worse by the fact that the most complicated thing my group ordered was French toast. The place wasn't packed so there was literally no reason for the slow service. To make matters worse the food was absolutely disgusting!!! We would have literally sent everything back if we weren't starving by that point and had committed so much time waiting. The French toast orders were burnt, the bacon was stale and gamey (no clue how they found gamey bacon), the sausage was obviously reheated as it was dry and leathery, \"home fries\" we're mostly undercooked sweet potatoes and all of the other food was over salted.   A place with less than satisfactory can usually redeem itself with good food. Once I saw the food quality slip I can't support this place any more. I used to recommend it to people if they understood they'd have to wait but never again. Nothing here is worth the bad and frankly rude service."}
{"text":"We came in here for lunch one Saturday.  It is a nice, large area with modern decor and a lot of natural light from the windows facing the street.  It provides many tables for people watching and has  large bar that would be good for mingling, but we went at a not-so-happenin' time.  They serve brunch until 2, and only brunch.  I was really not in brunch mood, but the food was pretty good.  They add a little bit of cajun flare to each of their dishes, but I didn't sample too much.  I like the atmosphere, and would love to go back for some real dishes.  It was somewhat torturous sitting there with a limited brunch menu and seeing all of their main dishes in fun typography all over the front windows.    I will try again for another meal, hopefully there will be a few more people there, too.  Sometimes it's creepy when it's you and three other tables in the whole place."}
{"text":"It sounds like this place is inconsistent, and I caught it on a bad day.  Was in Cleveland for work and went here with a co-worker who had been before and loved it.  Service was really slow, for drinks and food.  After I ordered it took them about 15 minutes to come back and say that they were out of the fish.  The waiter was really nice, but he was not on the ball, and he didn't know the menu very well.  The food itself was off too.  The chicken and waffles have a ridiculous amount of waffles, and the chicken is all wings if you order white meat?  Beer selection is boring and pricey.  Grits were solidifying when I got them.  Not the best soul food out there for my tastes."}
{"text":"I've visited the Zanzibar quite a few times and at times I sit at the bar I enjoy the wide selection of cocktails  this time was alil different the Server/Bartender was a bit side tracked he was friendly and prompt for the most part I would recommend this restaurant the food is consistently good the layout is my favorite it accommodate everyone"}
{"text":"What a difference a day or two can make...  Went back with two friends to enjoy the Restaurant Week special and ended up leaving flabbergasted that this was the same place I had enjoyed just a couple days ago.   I had such a pleasant experience the first time. Today's experience was decidedly unpleasant. I asked my friends a couple times if they thought we were on Candid Camera.   Af first, I thought it was our waiter's first day. He was hopelessly uninformed about the restaurant's menu and policies and generally slow. BUT he was adorable, so it was almost endearing how terrible he was. The manager did come over and answered our questions when we were left feeling like we were in the Twilight Zone after talking to our waiter.   After overcharging all of us on our checks (he blamed Restaurant Week), he had the manager bring our corrected checks to us. The manager (very pleasant, by the way) said he couldn't take them, that only the servers could cash out their customers. Huh????   When our waiter FINALLY came to collect them (after we had to send the bartender looking for him after 25+ minutes of waiting), my friend gently asked \"Hey, did you forget about us?\" and he immediately became defensive and said \"No, I had to take care of my other customers, and then I came over here as quick as I could.\"  We were LITERALLY the only customers, for over an hour other than one couple right next to us. LOL.    Overall, I left feeling very uneasy and negative about it... I definitely will be VERY torn in the future when I contemplate returning.... Will the delicious Kool Aid be worth being an hour late going back to work? Are those grits really SO good that the service won't seem AS ridiculous?   Time will tell..."}
{"text":"Holy cholesterol, this food is delicious.  Mini shrimp po boys? Yes please. They were definitely my favorite part of dinner.  We also ordered \"Soul rolls\" - an egg roll with chicken, black beans, corn and greens inside that was also very, very tasty!  For entrees, it was impossible to decide! Chicken and biscuits, chicken and waffles, pork chops, steaks, walleye, shrimp! Come on, Zanzibar, why are you doing this to me!? I decided on shrimp and grits. It was very good, but I think I would go with something else next time.  It was a little heavy on the peppers, onions and corn and less on the shrimp.  The jerk seasoned chicken that came from the kitchen for another table looked amazing.  Our service was very good, speedy and attentive - maybe they've worked on that issue.  Also on Mondays, they have a $6 martini special.  Basically every martini that would normally be $9 or under is priced to $6.  It's a pretty good deal, but all of their drinks are very sweet and fruity!  They are enormous, though, and a steal for $6."}
{"text":"First time visitor during brunch.  The servers were ok could be better.  Food was excellent however they ran out of French toast, how are you going to offer brunch & not have enough French toast? It's not like it was busy. Also when we asked for ketchup the server notified us that they were out of ketchup...seriously...you are out of a condiment? Lets get it together."}
{"text":"OMG...the best gritz and collard greens. We  had fried catfish and fried chicken. Both were generous portions. Service was great. Friendly staff and a great chef. Sunrise and sweet tea added to the dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome service!! Our waiter was super attentive and helpful. He went over all the specials and signature items. We decided on two appetizers and two lunch items. The appetizers came out hot and fresh. The signature soul eggroks were amazing!! Creamy, crunchy, crispy, and fresh! Can't wait to work through the rest of the menu on our next visit. The wings were large and crispy. I was so happy they weren't greasy! They had the  perfect amount of seasoning. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night, at around 8 pm. The service was excellent. We tried the grilled pork chop, chicken and waffles, greens, mac and cheese and wild rice. The entrees were very good. The chop had a nice dry rub and the chicken and waffles were delicious. I think the chicken and waffles was a great deal for $8. They were way better than the chicken and waffles people talk about from Southside. I recommended the place to some people I know that live around Shaker Square. I will definitely return. They also serve kool aid in mason jars. They have a mix of red kool aid and lemonade called the sunrise, or sunset. Should have tried it. Had a beer instead. First time in a long time where I honestly regret drinking a beer."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant about giving 5 stars, but I couldn't stop myself. The service was good. The atmosphere was was very comfortable and inviting. Ok, so the red velvet waffles (which is why I went) were just ok. I'm a fan of red velvet and a fan of waffles, so I was excited. I took a bite of the waffle and I was immediately disappointed. I had to drown them in butter and syrup. My advice is to change the waffle recipe. The cocoa in the waffles was not good. You don't need a gimmick  (red velvet waffles) to be successful. The other food will be a hit.   I tasted the grits next (the chicken was steaming hot and I had to let it cool). They were oh-so-yummy good. I've never been out for grits where I didn't have to doctor them up with butter and salt. They were a PERFECT consistency as well.   Lastly, I was able to eat the chicken. It was OMG delicious. It was crunchy, perfectly seasoned, moist and just plain ole good.   FIVE STARS!!!"}
{"text":"We made reservations, got to the restaurant tonight, and upon entering there were only two people in the entire place, there was a stench of raw sewage and they informed us that the grill was broke and they were limited to three items on the menu. The two ladies at the hostess stand were not professional and were surprised when we left. Doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Omg everything was absolutely amazing!!! Here is what we ordered: -Shrimp and lobster fritters x2 (yasssss) -Soul rolls (surprisingly delicious) -Catfish fingers x2 -Candid yams (to die for) -mac & cheese  -Bayou pasta -Fried catfish and grits (amazing) -Chicken and red velvet waffles -Peach cobbler -Bread pudding x2  EVERYTHING was soooooooo good; I was stuffed but couldn't put my fork down. The only negative I have to say about the meal was the chicken was dry. The waiter was nice enough to bring us a new order of chicken. Outside of that, the entire meal was great"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service sucked. Don't go is you are on a time restriction or if you are not patient. Our waitress was never around. The older woman in the woman in the front was more of a waitress to us. She was very friendly to us and all of the other customers. She had to get our waitress everytime in order for us to get our drinks, our food, our missing food missing from our order, and our check. Luckily the old woman continued to check on us or else we never would have ordered or gotten anything. She should have been our waitress instead of our actual waitress. She bought us hot bread before our waitress bought us cold bread after we already asked out waitress twice. Like I said, good food but the waiter need a lot for improvement. Even though we were warned by many people about the service before we even went to the restaurant, it still shocked me."}
{"text":"I was in town for the NBA Finals great food great atmosphere great staff really love the Chicken and Waffle keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Wonderful soul food, great drinks, beautiful patio! The artichoke and kale dip was amazing!"}
{"text":"Very unique food that has a different twist to it. Definitely something to try at least once though! Gator burgers are definitely worth trying at least for the experience."}
{"text":"While checking out the menu for Zanzibar online I was very impressed...lobster croquette, fried chicken and my fav Fried Green Tomatoes!  The drinks were great; who can resist Kool-Aid mixed with lemonade served in a mason jar YUM!  Nice wine & specialty drink selection.  The ambiance was casual and fun and our server was very friendly.  The area where Zanzumar is sitting is cute and seemed great for a date night.  The serving sizes were generous but, unfortunately, the flavors were a little bland.  The artichoke & collard greens dip was a shining star but I've had much better catfish & FG Tomatoes down south.  I'd give Zanzibar another try but I wasn't blown away by my first experience."}
{"text":"Not the best Soul food that I've had. The appetizer that is their take on a sushi roll was pretty good. For dinner I tried the chicken and waffles. Ehhhhh. Just wasn't good.  They tried to be different with the red velvet waffles, but they were just bland.  The chicken was okay, but I had asked it it was a boneless chicken breast and was told that it was.  Well, it wasn't and I'm not a fan of eating chicken with a bone. Atmosphere just wasn't there.  If your foods not great, then the atmosphere at least needs to be awesome."}
{"text":"I don't often pass out 1 star reviews and I also don't dine out in Cleveland often but I was in the area after returning a rental car back to the airport. My friend suggested the place and I heard lots about them so why not see what the hype is all about?? WHY?  At first sight I thought that that there was a time when the  place was really nice but it appears that they have started to let things go. Starting with the waiting area, The leather couch was cracking and busted. The bathroom had broken doors, smelled of urine and my friend said that her toilet didn't even flush. We sat at the bar and the seat cushions were coming off of the chairs (They needed to be tacked back down). So aesthetically speaking they need much, much improvement.   Now on to the food. I ordered the soul rolls which were good but small and had more collard greens in them than any other ingredient. at 8 bucks I definitely expected more.  Next, I have never heard of shrimp and grits in a gravy. I always see it prepared in a creole creme sauce or something similar. SMH what I received was a plate of grits with some shrimp swimming in brown gravy. If that was in the description I would have  never ordered it.  The lackluster food combined with the run down furnishings along with the bartender that not only cursed like a sailor but also kept throwing fruit into the trashcan from where he was standing, (Just rude) my overall experience is not a good one at all.   If I am ever in the Cleveland area I would not even look twice in the direction of the zanzibar. I am totally unimpressed with the overrated, overpriced, under maintenance of the place. They need a revamp for sure!   Not to mention there was no shortage of people in the place so its clear people are showing this place love...You simply have to put money back into your investment period!  Sorry Zanzibar you missed the mark on this one. I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Mediocre stonetown rolls, not impressed. Peach cobbler crust had no crunch, too doughy. I was ignored the first two times I came on Thursday afternoon so I tried again this evening. I sat myself and the bartender showed herself.  On the plus side, the drink special was good, and our waiter Quinton was attentive."}
{"text":"Dined for my anniversary. I ordered the soul rolls, they seemed small to me, my wife loved them. Also ordered the jerk wings that really didn't seemed jerked to me; seemed to be fried and dusted with spice, with a side of black eye peas which were cooked great. Wife ordered a pasta dish and she liked it. The lemonade and tea was great. Just seemed to be something missing, I really wanted to like this place. I'm a cook and worked at a lot of eateries, I just don't know...?Maybe my hopes were up so high. But I will try this place again soon."}
{"text":"When I come to visit the bf and he's coming off of work, we often end up looking for food at like 9-10pm.  Not all the great options are open on a weekday at 10pm, and we often end up with second rate food options because that's all that's left.  This time, I happened to find Zanzibar on Yelp, and noticed they're open until 1am on Friday and had pretty good reviews.  Lucky me!  I got the honey fried chicken, which came with delicious corn bread muffins, and 2 sides.  I got the potatoes (which were a little too cheesy for my taste), and the corn (delish! but it got too salty after a few bites). The chicken was lightly battered and covered in a honey sauce.  Yummy.  The bf got the bbq beef shank.  I was expecting some large bone of meat, but it looked more like pot roast or something when it came out.  It tasted yummy, came with 2 sides and the corn bread.  He got cole slaw and wild rice.  The cole slaw paired better with my friend chicken, so of course, I ate it for him.  The service was great.  Every time I thought I wanted something, the server appeared.  The iced tea drinks are sweet tea... be ware if you aren't a fan of super super sweet beverages.  I watered mine down with 2 glasses of water, so I guess I won't get sweet tea next time.  Good price -- it was a relatively bargain priced meal for the size of the portions.  We'll probably end up going back on some late night search for food.   Go check it out.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Hmm. An overall pretty unremarkable meal, but I'll stick to more traditional items next item.  Location: solid. The Shaker Square area is cool, and accessible.  Service: while well meaning, pretty intensely slow.  The recommendations were also less than stellar.  Food: this was the biggest disappointment.  I judge soul food restaurants based on their chicken (very good), their cornbread (nothing special), and their collard greens (absolutely horrible).  The last of those three, the greens, were, as one other reviewer described, drowned in vinegar.  I mean, I like bitter, but these were inedible.  Also tried the signature walleye cakes, and, though I'm not a huge crabcake fan (so this was a bit more out there than I usually go), they were just ok.  The cake wasn't entirely crispy on the outside, and the inside was a muddle of flavors, though the fish seemed relatively fresh(ish).  Still, the chicken was solid, the biscuits/waffles were whatever, and the mac & cheese, which I didn't try but others did, is supposedly \"excellent.\"  OH, and the cajun corn was very good (ESPECIALLY when compared to the collard greens).  One of the best things about this place, however, and the main reason I'll be back, is how affordable it was: just under $70 for four people with tip (though no booze)!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good, and my table was ready on time for the reservation I set. My only complaint would be how dry my pork chop was, and that they ran out of house potatoes."}
{"text":"Everytime I think about going somewhere special, Zanzibar creeps into my mind. I love the atmosphere in this restaurant. We always feel welcomed and taken care of. The full bar offers great martinis - the bartender Aaron always mixes up something delicious.   I almost always order fried catfish because its delicious and I tend to be a creature of habit once I find something I love. The shrimp and grits are also delicious, along with the greens, chix & waffles, and cornbread. I don't care for their mac & cheese but its not horrible.   Definitely a gem in shaker square. Reasonable prices, great food."}
{"text":"I went there a couple weeks ago and it's very obvious that the restaurant is still in its infancy.  The staff are nice enough, though maybe a tad inexperienced.  We waited for 15 minutes before our waitress even came to our table to acknowledge we were there and take our drink order.  She was new and still learning the menu so we had to do a lot of pointing so that she knew exactly what we were ordering.  My friend and I both ordered the chicken and waffles.  I also ordered the fried green tomatoes and a side of mac and cheese.  The chicken was fried very crispy, luckily the meat wasn't dry.  Waffles were too chewy for whatever reason.  Fried green tomatoes were nothing spectacular, but I have nothing to compare them too as that was my first time ever having them. The spicy remoulade served with the tomatoes tasted like nothing more than hot sauce.  The mac and cheese was pretty good.  They had a smokey flavor that my friend said tasted something like smoked gouda.  The drinks were a little weak.  I had my back to the bar but my friend said that the bartender was just pouring the ingredients of each drink directly into the martini glass as opposed to into a shaker which may explain why.  We ordered baked bread pudding for dessert, I am pretty sure I walked out with 2 new cavities.  It was unenjoyably sweet and the sauce they put on made it pretty soggy.  The ambiance is nice and it has potential but I think I will wait for them to work a few kinks out before I go back again."}
{"text":"YUM!!  I decided to check out stonetown (I've been wanting to since I saw it openend!) Was greeted with such FRIENDLY staff! Sat at the bar and the girl behind the bar was SO nice and helpful! Had a Christmas Ale (I LOVE that people still serve this- this is my first post-holidays in Cleveland and don't know if this is always how it is, but I'm a happy camper!)   I ordered the stone rolls (vegetarian) and sweet potato fries. The stone rolls were good! I would have probably preferred a little less rice, but it was still DELISH! (these are sushi like tempura fried rolls with veggies and rice- you can get them with chicken, too). It was served with a chili sweet sauce that was delicious and a wasabi sauce that was too spicy and wasabi-like for me.  I usually don't like sweet potatoes, but decided to order the sweet potato fries (makes a lot of sense, I know), but I'm glad I did! They were thin and on the crispy side, which is how I like my fries and were served with a sauce that clearly had hot sauce in it. YUM!   They're a bit expensive, but that's what you're going to get downtown.   PS I just had to walk over, but I heard them telling a customer that they validate parking in the garage next door if you spend at least 20 dollars (not sure the details, but be sure to park in that garage and ask!)  It was a bit empty in the restaurant, but for being open only 2 weeks without a grand opening, the girl behind the bar said they're doing pretty well- which i'm happy about! I'd love to see them last and stay in this location :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The blackened catfish was well seasoned and blackened--good but not amazing. The grits were great. Absorbed all the butter and seasoning, with a pleasing consistency balanced between creamy and grainy. Better than the typical bar and grills in the area.  Service was low key, cordial but not overly friendly or formal, like the decor. Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I don't usually go out of my way to write negative reviews, but I was extremely disappointed with this place. It looks really cool, but the service was crazy slow. When we got there as a party of 2, there was one other group finishing up and one person at the bar. Despite this, after they gave us the menu we waited about 20 minutes to order and had to flag down some other random waiter to help. Our initial waiter never even came back to the table and was unapologetic about it.  The food was super average, dry and kind of burnt, except for the mac and cheese, which was great. The door jammed as we walked out and one of the customers at the bar made a rude and disparaging comment. Overall, no one there seems to really care about their customers. Not a mystery now why there wasn't a crowd."}
{"text":"The food here is good, the atmosphere is ok. The customer service can be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"I am willing to give this place another chance but come back for their lunch/dinner menu.  Wanted to try something different so I ordered the Louisiana Quiche...didn't really like it.  I was there as soon as it opened (10:00 a.m.) and maybe 10-15 minutes later, things started to pick up...they were coming in groups lol. My server was okay...at times she was friendly but not rude."}
