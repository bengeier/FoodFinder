{"text":"HORRIBLE...they gave me 3 pieces of bone and a plate full of fat and oil. Very disgusting."}
{"text":"Ok their $5 mini rôti special is good. Def get the boneless goat, avoid the chicken which is just meh.   Had their jerk chicken with rice and peas and curry goat gravy. It was SPICY!!! However the jerk chicken wasn't - it was more sweet, like BBQ or stew. Weird. Still tasty just not true jerk.   Also had a bake and salt fish - nice.   Will def eat here again and again and keep trying diff things off the menu. Next up - shrimp rôti, doubles and stew chicken!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best doubles in the GTA. The pholorie is great, and the same for their other dishes (stewed chicken and Curry chicken). I visit here on a regular and the service and food is always great."}
{"text":"Discovered this place with a friend! I love their poulari and doubles!!! Place is clean and the staff are friendly. Prices are reasonable. They serve their food hot and fresh :)   I love it - would go back here. I live five minutes away from this restaurant which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Came here twice in one day... literally hours apart!  first time we came just got pick up some doubles because we had a craving and we were really happy with their service! Not the mention the doubles tasted amazing.  While we were there we looked at the menu and decided what we did want to come back for. We usually go to the location down in scarborough so it was nice to know one closer to me was now open.  So we came back to this plaza to get dinner only to be disappointed by the location we visited so we decided to go back to where we were happy.  This time around we dined in, i got the goat boneless small roti and my fiancé got the regular chicken roti - mild of course.  We were both happy with the portion size and flavour it, totally gave me my fix for west indian food!  we definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"I was just in for lunch today and had the boneless curry chicken roti. The lunch special is a small and only $6. It's easy to look at it an then wish you had a large, but if you consider the amount of food you're getting, it's easily sufficient for a meal.   With the pop, it was just $7 which makes it about as cheap a lunch as you can get. Good quality food and no complaints, but perhaps I should've spent the extra $1 to get the goat/shrimp mix. I found it somewhat mild for having ordered it spicy. I don't know if that's their regular spicy, or they just didn't make it as per normal.  Service could've improved, and I wasn't asked if it was to stay or go, so I had to get a plate myself and take the food out of the bag."}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken. Rôtis were pretty stuffed. Curry chicken was great as well. Been back twice and will return again."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh how I love roti.  This is by far one of my new favorite spots for roti.  Its very busy services is quick and food comes quick.  T None the less its well worth the wait.  I ordered the regular size boneless goat roti.  Now for those of you that have had roti you will know that sometimes depending where you get the roti 1 may not be enough.  Being my first time i ordered a small rice and peas to go with the roti that I ordered.  Big mistake the roti was huge and probably weighed about 5 lbs lol.  A meal on its own.  The roti was bursting with flavor leaving me wanting to lick the plate lol.  Rice and peas were fresh and tasty as well.  Drupatis you will be seeing a lot of me."}
{"text":"What's really funny about this place is it makes me feel really good walking inside, but maybe its because every time I walk into a west indian restaurant I feel good because of the smells coming from the kitchen... Doubles are a must when you come. I usually get 3 or 4 and curry goat dhalpuri if I'm in the mood. Everything was cooked to perfection and I really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered the curry goat roti for us. It looks like a burrito. The curry goat was savory, spicy and very flavorful. We would come back again to try the other items on the menu. A medium is a little too spicy for him so be careful."}
{"text":"Found this little gem through Yelp (thanks fellow Yelpers!).  Opted for the veggie plate with roti - it was so good. Tried the pumpkin, eggplant, chickpea, and potato curries, all were delicious. Roti skins were thin and tender, so so satisfying. We chose to eat in the restaurant which was cozy and clean. Bae had the boneless chicken roti and said he enjoyed it very much.   They also have plenty of meat options for all of you carnivores out there. Try the \"Ting\" soda if you haven't before, it is a great accompaniment to the spicy roti.  Will be back again to try their other vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Always go here for their doubles and chicken roti... consistent and never fails. Their food is delicious, their pepper level variates die to the peppers itself, one week they may be hotter then other weeks- it's all about the peppers. They offer variety of Caribbean eats, sweet and some home cooking to hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their doubles as I haven't tried anything else on their menu.  My coworker has gotten me many doubles from the Etobicoke location, so I was psyched when I saw they were opening a location right by my house!  I don't like getting my food too spicy to the point where I can't enjoy it, so I always get my doubles with slight spice. Trust me, they can make them really spicy for you if that's what you like!   I just love Drupati's doubles so much! Their flavours and chick pea filling is so delicious. I've tried Vishnu's and they're just not as good to me. I kind of feel like theirs is a little too greasy. Yes, Drupati's doubles can get greasy but not as. Also a double is pretty much a meal for me and at 1.99, you really can't lose lol.  They just opened this year, so if you're looking to try some good doubles, come here! My coworker also loves their chicken roti. I have yet to try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this location since it has opened. We love it! It's personally my favorite place for doubles. The bake and shark is very good aswell. Overall a great spot. On one occasion the wait time was extremely long (45min) but mostly it's average wait time."}
{"text":"When I heard this restaurant had opened and in my neighbourhood, I was stoked. I love me some doubles and pholourie. It was recommended to try the bake and salt fish. Omg! The flavours in this dish is super delicious. They stuff the bake with ample salt fish, not too salty, balanced with the famous trini green seasoning and cabbage. My absolute favourite to order thus far, with a side of pholourie. The pholourie are deep fried dough balls served with a tamarind chutney sauce. Can be easily shared as an appetizer. Super yummy. A must try. I haven't tried their doubles yet, but it's next on my list. The staff are sweethearts, great customer service and always welcoming. They also have daily specials, which makes it affordable if you want something cheap."}
{"text":"Loved their roti and chicken wrap.   Was not a fan of their doubles."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a while now. I personally feel that their food isn't as original as some of the other shops, but rather comes out much more refined and arguably better. They got the balance between all the flavours down nicely. The quality of their chicken is great too, just falls right off the bone as you touch it with the fork.   Their spice levels vary greatly, they've still got ways to go to find the right amount of spice for each setting (mild,medium,hot). I first time I came I got medium and I was full from a couple of bites simply due to the amount of water I had to drink.  The real hidden gem here is the coleslaw. It's simply amazing. However, if you want extra slaw it's a complete ripoff. $1.50 for a tiny container. Their doubles are pretty nice too.   4 stars for the work in progress spice levels and the ridiculously priced extra slaw."}
{"text":"Stopped in over the weekend while I was in the area and grabbed takeout. We got 2 chicken and two goat rotis to take home for dinner and doubles for the road. Not easy to eat in the car but so so delicious.  Had the rotis an hour later and they were incredibly delicious too. Only complaint was there could have been more meat and gravy, it was a bit dry. The pepper sauce is amazing, hot but very flavourful  (I get it on the side). Service was fast and friendly.  Will visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First attempt at Trinidad cuisine and luckily a good introduction to it.  I was told by a friend to try Doubles in general and due to proximity & timings we ended up here. Service was super friendly and place is tidy.  Doubles were great, not too greasy and chickpeas were melting in my mouth. For a party of six, I believe we ordered a lot!  2 doubles, 1 plulourie, 1 sahiena, 1 jerk chicken plate, 1 veg platter, 2 boneless chicken and 1 bone-in chicken plate. Too much!  My major take away from today's adventure was Sahiena and Mango Curry. Without giving away any spoilers, these are a must try! Chicken in all dishes was tender and juicy. But next time around we're gonna ask for spicy level. Medium didn't leave any after taste.  Guess we're gonna hunt down all other Trinidadian joints now!"}
{"text":"Great place for doubles and roti. I had the regular curry chicken roti. The potion was very generous. I underestimated how big the regular sized roti would be. Chicken was tender and the sauce was flavourful. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Drupatis in Toronto has been a staple for our family so I expected the same from this location.   Friendly staff 10/10 Food flavour 10/10 Value 5/10  I ordered the goat roti and you can only imagine the smile on my face when I walked out of the restaurant with my order that weighed a good 3lbs. When I got home and opened the massive roti I was surprised to see it was almost ALL ROTI. Goat roti $10.75, roti skin $2.75.....smh!!"}
{"text":"I am in search for good jerk chicken. I tried their jerk chicken style and it was pretty good. The flavour didn't seep into the meat though. It was dominantly the skin that had the flavour. Spice level was decent. The rice and peas was pretty good. Not as dry and flavourless as others. Is it normal to have slaw with your jerk chicken because I didn't get any? Other places I've tried always gave me coleslaw. I tried the chicken boneless roti and it was pretty good on the spice level. Portion wise, decent size for the price."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last week for breakfast. We were pleased to find out about their breakfast buffet for $10.99 per person. It had all the good old home cooked foods like bake and saltfish, baigan choka (eggplant), fried potatoes and more. The only one thing that I'd say would have been nice is the buffet included only tea or coffee for a drink and if you don't drink one of those they wouldn't substitute it for juice or water so you had to pay extra for that. We will certainly be going here again :)"}
