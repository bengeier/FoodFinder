{"text":"For someone from Utah this is not the typical pizza joint.  In fact I did not get pizza at all- I ordered the butter chicken and rice.  It was delicious.  The server gave me extra which made me happy.  As for the pizza I cannot vouch for yet.  Next time I come to Calgary I will though.  Two thumbs up for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Cheap, fresh and yummy! Staff is always friendly. Unfortunately, the location can draw some sketchy characters so I avoid going too late into the night."}
{"text":"Shwarma, donair, butter chicken, fried chicken, potato wedges, and oh, yes - pizza.

I went with a couple of friends, we tried out all the different types of food on the menu.  
Shwarma - money!!!!  Wow, very well done.  Polished this one off quickly between the three of us.
Fried chicken and potato wedges, 3 pieces w/ can of pop = $6!! Not only unbelievable deal, but the chicken was tasty, not too greasy.  Same with the potato wedges, little bit of corn starch and seasoning.  Very good and tasty.
Butter chicken - very good as well, we also tried the spicy chick pea item (sorry, forgot the name).  Very good and basmati rice well cooked.
Pizza - just couldn't do it.  It looked good and it flew off the pizza-holder, but we were beyond full.

Service - you line up, get the food and pay.  Then you sit down in the well-lit clean and cafeteria style room.  The guys and one woman were all very friendly and efficient.

Excellent overall experience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I recommend this place. I was visiting Calgary and stayed across the street from this place for three days. I had shawarma, salad, pizza, and curries and it was all good. The highest price was 6 bucks. This place is a bargain.Why cook if you lived near by. I think it is open late too so after the club this is a good place to scoff down some food. My only complaint was they never had tabbouleh."}
{"text":"This place went from being a total hole in the wall, to being bright, spacious and welcoming. 

Recently renovated, this location of Great Canadian Pizza is now bumpin' and bustlin'.

The service is great, the atmosphere is now welcoming, and the food is CHEAP!

While this place used to be dead and disgusting, it is now always packed over lunch hour. 

A little bit of renovating can go a long way!"}
{"text":"Talk about hole in the wall!

I have been to this location twice and both times, I have darted in and out, trying to reduce my time spent inside this establishment to a minimum! The location and customers are a bit unnerving to me.

So why do I go there? Holy cow, have you HAD their biryani?!? For just 6 bucks, you get a nice little box of amazing chicken biryani. Ridiculously good deal!! Not gourmet by any means.. its greasy, but HECK is it tasty! I usually try not to finish the entire box by myself, but who are we kidding? I've done it. 

It's a good thing this place is not too close to my house because I'd be buying from there everyday!


Review #13 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Lunch means an angry stomach that needs to be tamed like a beast born from hunger... or something. So my co-worker and I quickly darted across the street to Great Canadian Pizza & Fried Chicken to give their Beef Donair a shot.

Staff is friendly here, ordered and served almost immediately. I got a medium sized Beef Donair cause my co-worker got the large and he usually eats more than me. Thankfully I made the right choice cause when all the preparation was complete and he gave me my medium size I was already afraid of contracting the \"itis\".

The medium Beef Donair was $6.99 perfect size for me, just grab a bottle of water from where ever and you're pretty much good to go. 

I was really looking they had some Beef Samosa's but they didn't oh well hopefully I'll have a chance to have it another time.

Another good quick lunch spot to hit up when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting the city as part of a family trip. It was dinner time and we all wanted to find a pizza joint. A quick search brought this place up. The previous reviews encouraged me to try it and so we walked down the street to this place. Look and cleanliness could have been way better, but the pizza we ordered was awesome. Not overly greasy, excellent cheese, and just enough toppings. Dont let the look fool you. The pizza is world-class."}
{"text":"Don't bother getting the goat curry. For $9.40, you'll get about a pound of rice and two tiny pieces of goat (maybe 3oz). My goat was about 50% pure fat and 25% bone. Ultimately I ended up with less than 1oz of meat and just ate rice for dinner. I will absolutely never return here."}
{"text":"The name isn't exactly inspiring, and the place may not look like much, but once you've actually eaten there, that kind of becomes part of the appeal. It gives a more down to earth, local, almost diner-esque feel to the experience.

I haven't tried the chicken or shwarmas but the pizza is absolutely awesome, especially for the price. Great quality ingredients, made fast, and for an awesome price. I live just around the corner, so I generally call in my orders for pickup and they're almost always ready to go within 10 minutes, and you can pick up a 16 inch, which is bigger than most pizza places even make, for about 13 bucks. Furthermore, they don't charge by the topping like a lot of places, so you can really pile them on. As for the other items, while I haven't tried them myself, I've never heard a negative word out of those who have, so they must be pretty good as well.

The staff are also very friendly and provide great service (I've been greeted by a big smile every time).

The only reason this place loses a star is the look, which lends to serious misleadings about the establishment. I avoided this location for several months based on the visuals which, while not dirty or unsanitary in any way, aren't exactly eye catching or welcoming either. This is the main reason that, despite having tables for in-house dining, I've never cared to try.

All I can say is, don't judge this book by it's cover. The friendly people and the great food (at great prices) will not disappoint.

{"text":"This was another great canadian pizza that i tried in downtown. 
The service was pretty good and friendly guy outta there. It is open till late nights. 
The pizza slice that we get here are very tasty. I especially liked the veg-pizza slice here. And ofcourse the chicken leg pieces. They were not great but not bad at the same time. 
The sitting place was pretty better than the one on 4th avenue . 
Chicken biryani was not bad too but never to try it with a chicken curry on.
They also serve rice with different choices of curries. The price is pretty reasonable and worth it. 
And samosas here were like ok ok. 

Overall not a bad place to try if you are hungry :) . 
The best i liked here : Veg-pizza slice.

Yelp's 30 day challenge - 4/30."}
{"text":"Its my favorite pizza and its cheap and close by. I've seen mice running in and out and its routinely dirty and full of unsavory characters. 

Cheap, delicious, dirty pizza with lots of toppings."}
{"text":"Good place for some cheap pizza. I wouldn't recommend going there at night though as it tends to get a bit \"rowdy\" in that area. The restaurant is also pretty grimy."}
{"text":"This place is trying to be too many things to too many people. (Is it a pizza place? Is it an indian place, is it a kabab house, is it a shawarma shop? or a donair place???? I have NO IDEA)
They have updated the decor inside, which helps a LOT. (Before it looked like a cafeteria at a druggie drop-in/hostel), but at the end of the day it's still basically a small mom&pop type business doing the best they can with what they've got. I'm sure renting space from the Boardwalk people doesn't help either. 
Their pizza is always doughy. (We've ordered at least 3 times, and been disappointed as many) The sauce lacks flavour. I'm pretty sure the only reason it is pizza sauce is because it's \"red\".
Their chicken is delicious, if not SUPER greasy. Their potato wedges are also SUPER greasy but tasty.
I have yet to try the indian dishes here. (biryani, butter chicken and others) I just have issues with ordering curries that sit in chaffing dishes that aren't steaming hot! (Can you say food poisoning?) 

I regularly stop in for a chicken or beef shawarma. Easily the BEST shawarma I have tried in Calgary. They will try to put hot spicy Chinese sauce on it, but I guess someone must like it? I always pass.

HOWEVER- consistency is a MAJOR issue with this place. Because I live close by and have eaten here enough times, if I'm in the mood for donair or shawarma and the right person isn't working behind the counter, I keep walking.

Dinginess and lack of consistency make my review go way down, BUT the fact that usually the shawarma is phenomenal brings it back up. Honestly it's more like a 2.5-2.8 type restaurant...but since I can't give it that, It'll have to be just 2 stars."}
{"text":"What an awful experience. I ordered a medium pizza with tandoori chicken, green olives and Jalapeños. They delivered a shawarma chicken with onions and jalapeños buried in cheese. Pizza 101 is that cheese goes under the toppings. Upon delivery, I could only see cheese on top and slight jalapeños. Awful service. I tried calling back a few times to let them know, he kept cancelling my call. Pizza has an awful after taste otherwise I would've eaten it. There goes my $30 bucks."}
