{"text":"This is our absolute favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary! The service is always super nice and the newly renovated layout looks so great! The food was delicious and they even modified a dish to accommodate my food allergies... we go so often that each time we order they already know our usual by heart! Can't say enough good things about this place :)"}
{"text":"Best Bun you'll find in Calgary. Springs rolls are good, but just average. Friendly and quick service. Defiantly recommend for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I'd give them zero stars if I could. Ordered a large order from here. Food was cold and tasted stale. Tried to get a refund but the place refused. $74 in the garbage. Never getting food from here again"}
{"text":"The food here is above average. The spring rolls and salad rolls are yummy and so is their BBQ selection. However I think the service can be a little more kind and polite. My crispy noodles with seafood lacked...seafood..so that's kind of a problem."}
{"text":"I have been to this Vietnamese restaurant a few times and i must say, the ONLY reason i go is for the bbq pork salad rolls.
This place has the absolute worst spicy seafood noodle soup I've ever had. It's like they attempted to make it a cream based soup. It's sad when a restaurant fails horribly at such a great dish. 
That being said, their service sucks rocks.
 I was going to have a order of bbq pork salad rolls for dinner tonight. Emphasis on 'was'....I'm sitting in Humpty's next door writing this review. 
The restaurant was close to empty when i arrived, i stood waiting to be seated or even acknowledged for over 5 minutes before anyone came out of the back. When someone did come out the employee then ignored me refusing to make eye contact while i tried to signal her and proceeded to walk away before turning around and saying: 'oh, you want a table?' In a snarky tone...the restaurant was open for another 2 hours. It's not like i came right before closing. 
I turned and walked out the door, shaking my head.  Guess it was too much of a bother to serve me. 
Your pork salad rolls aren't worth my business.
I won't be back."}
{"text":"Thought I should update after another couple more tries... first off, these folks deserve another star to separate them from the miserable incompetent folks a block away at Lemongrass. Really, the food isn't a whole lot better, but the staff is pleasant here and they at least get your order right.

Secondly, they do make a passable bahn mi sandwich."}
