{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. I often get the grilled pork vermicelli.

The guy that used to work there was great! Super friendly and quick. The man that works the cash now isn't as nice. After a rude encounter with him, I'm sad to say I've boycotted the place (for a while at least).
It was a usually busy lunch time period and I ordered my usual. The guy told me that the pork would take 15-20 minutes but if I switched to beef, it would be much faster. I didn't necessarily want that, but I was short on time so I reluctantly agreed.
As they served 10+ people who were before AND after my order, I got a little annoyed. 20 minutes later I'm still waiting for my order and upon asking him if it was coming up, he held up his hand to shush me and kept saying \"we're busy today.\"
Be that as it may, you made me change my order because it would be faster. If I was going to wait 20+ minutes ANYWAY, I may as well have kept my original selection. I told him such and he just got angry and defensive saying that they're busy. Once I finally got my order, it was #1 incorrect (I asked for no bean sprouts), and #2 such small servings all plopped into the take out box.

Food - delicious, Service - RUDE."}
{"text":"A very nice and cozy Vietnamese place to eat a reasonably priced lunch for under $10 from this beautiful country. The Curry Chicken Vermicelli with no broth and more of a curry based liquid sauce was very well balanced and tasted even better with the added chilli sauce and other sauces available on the table. Service is fast and staff are nice and friendly ."}
{"text":"The chicken pho was super hot and wonderfully comforting on this rainy day. I got take out so can't comment on in house experience, but my pho was ready within 1-2 mins of ordering. Broth was flavourful, bean sprouts had been added to the broth already but were still nice and crunchy by the time I got back to my desk.

Looking forward to going back for more pho soon!"}
{"text":"I live in, but work outside this area, so I was really curious to try this restaurant on my day off since they open only during office hours (11am to 6pm weekdays only). (Un)fortunately, I realized I haven't been missing much.

The menu is very limited (none of the good offal goodness available at your typical pho restaurant), the portions are small, overpriced, and they take cash-only. It is like the worst of the two worlds of fusion restaurants and authentic ethnic restaurants. That being said, the food isn't terrible. Just nothing special

The only positive point is that the soup-base they use in the noodles are actually not fatty, but still contains a lot of flavour. I suppose if you're short on time, stuck in the area, and craving for pho, it'd be an option. Otherwise, either go west to Arlington for Pho St Clair, or head Chinatown for some authentic pho."}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the OMG soup with shrimp with extra hot sauce! Great service, super busy during lunch hours but they are quick to keep the line moving. Spring rolls, Chilli pork, Wonton soup are all good but the OMG is the real deal - spicy and sour."}
{"text":"Yonge and St. Clair only exists for lunch. There's lots of places here for work lunch, but I still get somewhat bored of the options. That's why Sprout is good. It's a bit different. I can only review one product here, which is the rare beef pho, which I've probably had around 20 times, but when I want Vietnamese, that's what I get. 
When there's no one in the place the service is really, really fast. However, if there's a bit of a line, it can take 15 or 20 minutes to get the Pho. I like the way they serve it for take-out also. 2 containers, rare beef in one, and the broth in the other. Take 'em back, mix 'em up, and they're good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I first discovered it with coworkers when looking for a lunch place last summer, and have been hooked ever since. 

I always get the tofu pho with chicken broth, and it's sooo good. The portions are pretty big, too, so I always feel like I'm getting my money's worth. 

The noodles used in the pho are rice based, which is (partially) what drew me in to begin with, and even better some of their spring rolls are made with rice paper so I can eat those, too. You wouldn't believe how many \"traditional\" Vietnamese or Thai food places in the city don't use rice noodles, so I love that a place near me does.

My only complaint is the hours: they strictly cater to the business crowd, so operate 11-5 M-Th and close at 4 (or earlier!) on Fridays. Not open on weekends - a total bummer when I have a hankering for pho on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Good spot that presents a unique option for the neighborhood.  Let's get it straight, the pho is pretty westernized so I would never rank this place among the best or most authentic Vietnamese cuisine out there.  But that being said, the food tastes fresh, clean, consistent but portion sizes are a bit on the smaller side.  The OMG soup is quite tasty and it's pretty much the only thing I order at this point after trying a few menu items."}
{"text":"I love everything about Sprout.

I love how it's near my office.

I love the pleasing design. The original names for dishes that are tasty twists on the usual Vietnamese fare, like \"OMG Soup\". The fact that everything's a notch better than it needs to be.

I like how quiet it is, despite regular clientele. How interesting the clientele are, despite it being a \"work\" area. And most of all the friendly, personal service.

Did I mention I love Sprout?

P.S. - Cash only."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch since I work basically next door - it's a cozy little place, but if you have more than two people with you, then be prepared to wait because most tables are just for two. 

Whenever I visit a Viet restaurant, I stick to my standard beef brisket pho order - it was a hearty portion, but I feel like the flavor was a bit lacking? I couldn't put my finger on it, but I know for sure I've had better broth. So, definitely not the best pho I've had, but I can see myself visiting again if I'm ever craving it and need something close and quick.

The service was really good, though. My friends and I couldn't find seats at first and so we kept switching between \"take out\" and \"nevermind, dining in\" several times and the owner didn't mind at all. There was also an incorrect order they brought out for one of us that they corrected immediately. Our server was really sweet and friendly and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"A solid pho spot midtown. I had pho and shrimp fresh rolls with peanut sauce. Service was excellent (friendly, quick), the place was clean, and the food was good. It's not anything to write home about (I'm a picky pho eater), but it was a great fix for a big pho craving. I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Review on the Run:

I'd give my left arm for an authentic Pho place to be around here.  Unfortunately Sprout is a very dumbed down version of the real stuff.  The food isn't aweful, but the Pho consists of a few pieces of sliced beef flank or a choice of a few sliced pieces of chicken breast.  *ugh*

Conclusion: Eat here?  No."}
{"text":"The Sprout is cheap and cheerful - the owner always has a funny joke or something nice to say to each of the customers as he's taking their order. Service is quick, too. The menu is on a giant chalkboard on your left when you walk in, and you place your order at the front. There's plenty of seating in the back - even though the restaurant looks small at first glance. My go-to is always the wonton soup."}
{"text":"Julie

Dropped by for lunch and thought the BBQ chicken over rice noodles was quite tasty.  most of the menu items looked great and pics offer the newbie to Viet food a visual of what to order.  I really wanted the pork chops but apparently they run out of entrees towards the later part of the lunch time rush.

Only problem is that they take cash only...  Other than that.. Great or really it was just super quick service...."}
{"text":"Portion size is phenomenal, especially for a place so close to Yonge Street. Staff are friendly and there's very little wait time. 

Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Tasty food with fast and friendly service! What more could you ask for? The owner and staff are some of the nicest people ever, making The Sprout my go-to lunch spot in the neighbourhood. Everything I've ordered has been awesome but the grilled chicken with vermicelli really stands out. A must try!"}
{"text":"Best service ever! I think it was the owner that takes your order at cash, but I had come in a few times already and he noticed and formally introduced himself and shook my hand. Such a sweet man.

Come before 12 or you'll be waiting in a line that goes past their door! They are best known for their pho but I got the chicken vermicelli. Great place to grab a bite to eat for lunch since it is pretty filling. I wouldn't say it's the best Vietnamese food in the GTA, but decent for price and convenience. Not too many tables to eat inside, but your food will be ready within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed by today's lunch from Sprout! I used to come here often when I lived in the neighborhood, and now that I work up here, i was happy to visit Sprout. My all time fave was the rare beef pho, which I ordered today for take-out. Upon my return to my desk I was very disappointed.
Why? Well, they used to give you separate containers for the broth, and for the rare beef, and basil leaves separate again. Today? Nope. Just one big giant container. Hmm.. I think. The rare beef won't be so rare but that's ok. Little did I realize... Wha??? Where's the rare beef? why is there... TURKEY?? in my rare beef pho??? It might be chicken, but it looks and tastes a LOT more like turkey.
One of the worst things about take-out is when you get back to your desk, all unpacked, and you realize what you got is something other than what you ordered. I don't even think turkey is on their menu? It's Pho, for Christsakes, have you heard of turkey pho??
to give them credit, there is some (a small amount) of non-rare beef, but they completely F-ed up my order and I am irritated. Turkey pho?
The broth is still good, but this is the weirdest lunch I've had in a while.
Not cheap either. Almost $9 when near my house I share phos with 2-3 people for less. 
Oh well. Chalk one up to high expectations, low delivery. Here I sit at my desk eating turkey mixed with small amounts of well-done beef pho. I guess Thanksgiving was pretty recent."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch work crowd but has difficult hours outside of that scope. 

The food while delicious doesn't taste authentic or anything like pho. If you want a real pho experience, I wouldn't try for it here. Of you want great tasting soup, by all means, this place is alright. 

Food portions are small so be cautious if you're thinking of indulging yourself in authentic pho as you will receive neither an authentic taste, nor much in quantity.

3/5 stars"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! The owner is super friendly and great with the guests! Good beef brisket pho I always come back for this! Decent pricing too! Only downside is that they close at 5 which means no dinner hours but great food!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place since working in the neighborhood. My go to order is the grilled chicken on vermicelli/rice and the spring rolls. The food is always tasty and pretty quick to order.  I've not yet tried the pho, but I cannot help but order the same thing every time. In the past, you could only pay with cash. it seems that they've now offer choice to pay by interac. Out of habit, I still pay in cash. 

Love the owners because they are overly friendly and warm. I guess it also helps that they recognize me as I've visited their restaurant many times. :) Definitely a go to for lunch."}
{"text":"In one of my stints at pretending I was friendly enough and skinny enough to be a receptionist, I found there were no healthy and good places to eat around me unless I wanted to step down to the main floor cafeteria to grab a bowl of curried hair and brown lice.

On one miraculous afternoon I stumbled upon Sprout, a Vietnamese restaurant barely big enough to squeeze in twenty Suits.  Despite the crowdedness of the joint I used my feminine prowess to slip through the line-up and ordered myself a big bowl of Hot and Sour soup.  The soup, in my opinion, is their specialty, packed with mushrooms, protein of your choice, and of course, sprouts.  There are also a variety of Vietnamese specialties -- salted shrimp, salad rolls etc -- all good quality, and all cheap."}
{"text":"Go for the Pho and OMG soups. Amazing portion sizes filled with noodles, veg.  and protein of your choice.  Super fast service too"}
{"text":"Came here on a cold day for lunch and it was quite satisfying! A bit on the pricier side but understandable due to the location. You order at the front and then sit down to wait for your meal (~5 min wait). I got the Pho with rare beef,brisket and chicken. So filling, the portion was decent but there was a lot of rice noodles so I couldn't finish. Would come back since it's so close to work!"}
{"text":"This isn't the place for authentic vietnamese food.  It's a quick fix solution to a craving  when you don't have time to go to one of your favourite authentic places.  

However, the take-out portions were a good size, and they don't skimp on the meat, meals are around $8 and sides (rolls) are about $4-5.  If you work/live walking distance and need to urgently satisfy your craving for vietnamese food, this place can do the trick."}
{"text":"Great place on St Clair. Staff is super friendly. Their Vietnamese coffee is great!! Their pho is the perfect size especially if you need to get back to work ASAP. Grilled meat is so good. I've been getting it so often!"}
{"text":"The \"Oh My Goodness Soup\" definitely lacked the \"Goodness.\" When the bowl of noodle first arrived, it smelled and looked so good. My stomach was growling like I had not eaten for days. However, after my first bite, I was quite disappointed to say the least. The soup lacked flavour, the noodles used were vermicelli (not the typical rice noodles) and the meat portions were small. I am guessing the high reviews is due to the limited choices in the area. Unfortunately, this was not the place to satisfy my craving for authentic vietnamese pho."}
{"text":"Great for lunch! Their grilled meat is amazing and wonton soup was good too! 
They take cash/debit/credit now"}
{"text":"The pho is pretty bland but the won ton soup and spring rolls are excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for pho, but nothing special. Ordered the pho with rare beef, beef brisket and chicken, which was $7.52 plus tax. The size of the pho was pretty good for the price (probably considered a large at most other places), and there was quite a lot of meat in it. However, I had a hard time distinguishing between the beef and the beef brisket. Soup was pretty light, not bad. I do wish they had provided bean sprouts on the side rather than already in the soup."}
