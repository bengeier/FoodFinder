{"text":"New definition of bland! In a blind taste test, one would not be able to distinguish between the chow mein, chop suey, or beef teriyaki.  All the food we ordered was lacking flavour. The ribs were surprisingly monstrous, but not in a good way. They looked like they came from a brontosaurus.  Service was great, as we were the only ones in the restaurant. Close attention but not smothering.  Although the 20% off was helpful, we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Ordered from here randomly months ago and love it! Very professional and courteous! Food is also really good! I love the Singapore noodles ! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Usually very good. Tonight the worst. Warm tasteless long ribs. Warm tough chicken balls. Cold sweet and sour sauce. When I called in they \"generously\" offered me $5 off my next order which has resulted in me taking them off my restaurant  list. My order was $45 for two people. When I asked for a decent portion of sauce when I placed the the order it was an additional $1.50. Cluelessness marketing. The sauce is normally in a Swiss chalet sauce sized container. I am now putting 90% of my meal in the green bin."}
{"text":"It's been cold these past few days and I've been craving Chinese food. I ordered from them over the phone. The person who took my order was very helpful with my questions. The delivery person was on time and polite. Food was pretty good too! I'm definitely going to try them again."}
{"text":"I went to this newly opened spring china house. Food was what I expected and the service was well mannered and timely. My girlfriend and I will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"We order pickup from this place periodically. It's average at best but there really aren't any great Chinese food places nearby. I like the egg rolls and soup. Tonight we ordered soup, egg rolls, black bean chicken, shanghai noodles, and crispy ginger beef. Noodles were bland, chicken was slimy, and there was a STAPLE IN MY BEEF (see picture). It was not sitting on top but embedded inside the beef. How does that even happen?? I could have been feeding this to my child - or I could have swallowed it and have it perforated my organs! The owner apologized and offered us a free crispy beef next time. Not that I plan on ordering from there again but that's the kind of offer you make if someone finds hair in their food...not when they find something that could have seriously injured them!  Will never order from there again. I can see from the reviews on here that they seem to have an issue with metal items and bugs being found in their food."}
{"text":"I ordered from here recently and was not impressed. First of all, I was told that delivery would take 45-55 mins or sooner, my order did not arrive until 1.5 hours later. My food was cold, slimy, and bad quality. And to top it off, I found a bug in my food. Will not be ordering from here again. Overpriced."}
{"text":"Was desparate on snowy day to order from a place close by. Big mistake. Terrible portion sizes. First time ordering here. Paying more for less food!!!  No thanks.  Will continue to go to our usual Chinese food take out place next time even in desparation."}
{"text":"Got takeout tonight and the food was really good! Not greasy and the flavour was spot on.  Will definitely order from there again!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, and discovered this place.  Ordered the dinner for two, beef option.  Was simply Devine!!  Food was delivered steaming hot and fresh!  The beef was so tender and delicious.  Wings were awesome!!  Will try an order of them next time.  This was our second time ordering, and I am happy to say, we will order again!!  Great local Chinese food!! Fast delivery!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered online from this restaurant and my boyfriend and i had the chicken chop suey. He took a bite of it and he found a long metal string mixed into it. Disgusting."}
{"text":"It's a great takeout place or someplace to grab a quick lunch. Everything I've tried so far is pretty good, (eg. beef with broccoli, cashew chicken). Definitely not the cheapest takeout, but the restaurant is very clean. The downside is the parking, the plaza they are in is tiny and sometimes there isn't any spaces left. Wish they would have more options for the lunch menu or allow substitutions. Otherwise, there isn't anything to complain about."}
{"text":"Zero stars should be available. The driver withheld my food because I did not put a tip on the receipt. I had to demand my food from him twice. I showed him it was paid for. He told me yes, but no tip! I showed him the 2 twoonies in my hand I had to give him. He reached for the $4. I held it back and took my food and did not give him the $4. He then called me a \"f--king b--ch\". I called and complained. The manager was also rude but eventually apologized, when I said I would call Just-Eat and complain. He also said he would give me a $5 credit for next time. Next time? NEVER me again! I don't know if there food is good because after the bad taste in my mouth from the abuse I received at the door, I couldn't eat. BTW, their Cantonese Chow Mein is made with 2 bricks of Ramen dropped in the bottom of a container with the veg and meat on top. You have to break up the Ramen and remove the hard lumps that didn't soften. Horrible!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on a Wednesday afternoon. I had repeated my same order as last time. The first time it was good. This time, it took over an hour to be delivered which is understandable if it is busy. When the food arrived, it was not fresh. We ordered vegetables and tofu, vegetable fried rice, samosas and spring rolls. The spring rolls and samosas were good. The sauce on the vegetables and tofu was different than before, and not good. The rice was supposed to be vegetarian but it had chicken. When I called back to let them know, the manager, bill, argued with me saying that the \"chicken\" I found was actually mushrooms.. I understand that mistakes happen but the customer service to rectify the situation was subpar."}
{"text":"I was delighted with my first experience with this restaurant.  The online ordering is very user friendly. I didn't realize that I was entitled to complementary cans of soda, and was pleased that an employee took the time to call me, to ask what kind I would like. The delivery driver was extremely polite. Most impressive of all was the freshness of the food when it arrived! The plates I ordered I could tell was prepared FRESH!  I will be ordering from here again. Not greasy!"}
{"text":"Have to say that when they opened and I was told they were the staff from China House, I walked a wide path around them.  I hated China House and next to Sea Hi was one of two places that made me ill just thinking about them.  It was a  place you dragged people to do Jewish Christmas or New Years or Easter or Thanksgiving or or or...  But I had a discount with TasteAway and decided to try them out.  I LOVE the Tom Yam Goong soup and the hot and sour and have found little to complain about.  Perhaps the earlier review of this place where during growing pain phase.  I have ordered from them several times and have found nothing to be disappointing."}
{"text":"Great greasy Chinese food. Good amount for the price. Have ordered delivery from here 4 times now and its always been super fast and they haven't got and order wrong yet!"}
{"text":"Over cooked flavourless mush.   Found a bug in the sweet and sour sauce. When driver came back for food after we called and complained. He kept asking if we are sure it's a bug. Not sure if a bug or a horse has wings and six legs now. Driver finally took the food and gave us our money back after telling him about 10 or more times we don't want a credit if we will never eat there again we just want our money back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch.  Cantonese fried noodle.  It was very good.   I ate it all.  I am tired of delivered pizza.  I hope the home delivery is as good as what I just ate at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Dynamite food, quick delivery, quality ingredients, and all-around pretty great 'Canadianized' Chinese food.  Minus 1 star for the prices, which are about 20% higher than many places, but that is largely made up for by really good quality, and some pretty solid daily specials, like the Wednesday beef and broccoli pictured below.  I admit I love their \"spicy szechuan beef rolls\", which aren't all that spicy, nor szechuan, nor a healthy choice, but are really delicious spring rolls filled with what tastes like a real deal Philly cheese steak filling, which tastes very beefy and cheesy, with just a hint of spice.  (Note: NOT like a Canadian style Philly, which is typically just boring roast beef loaded with green peppers, LOL).  Also addictive, & absurdly overpriced are the appetizers they call \"deep fried Cream Cheese & Crab wontons\", which is their take on traditional American crab rangoons. Interestingly sweet, with nearly undetectable artificial crab meat inside, and folded to yield the least possible filling, yet absolutely delicious and addictive and another decadent must-have on all my delivery orders.  Other recommended items from recent orders include tasty Singapore noodles, shown here with the shrimp and char siu pork hiding under the noodles, lunch special General Tao chicken served on steamed rice, and of course their delicious specials of the day, Wednesday's Beef with Broccoli, and the Saturday special Crispy Ginger Beef, which was devoured before that picture could be taken.  All in all, a really solid local takeout and delivery joint that only suffers from prices that are a higher than they should be, but delivers solid, tasty, Canadian style Chinese food."}
{"text":"I ordered food through the Just Eat app, where this restaurant overwhelmingly scored 5/6 stars. I wish I had read more reviews before I ordered. This was the worst Chinese food we have ever had. Every dish was bland and soggy. We moved to Toronto from Halifax- the whitest place in Canada- and had better Chinese food there. Completely disappointing."}
{"text":"I got the chicken fried rice to go, which was daily special (changes everyday), for $5.09 after tax. Took around 15 minutes to prepare it. There was free Wi-Fi available. The fried rice was not as greasy as other Chinese restaurant, which was to my liking. Portion size was slightly bigger than normal for the price.  However it lack much taste. Would still come back in the future to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant twice so far using JustEat.ca, and can say that I was very happy with how both orders turned out. I had the Cantonese style Lo Mein noodles , as well as the sweet and sour pork dish with my first order. I then tried the general Tao chicken the second time around . Each dish was very tasty and the ingredients were fresh. The delivery service was excellent as well. I would definitely order from here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Good. Very saucy. Reasonable food. Delivery was on time and easy.  I wouldn't order from here again... Mostly just because there are other really good spots but I wouldn't be upset if I was made to eat the food again.  We got general tao chicken and Cantonese chow mein and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Delivery was prompt and the food came hot and fresh. The Cantonese Chow Mein was decent, however the Chow Mein noodles weren't crispy like I had hoped for. Still a great value, with lots of shrimps and meat. Combo for  1 with chicken balls is pretty standard. Good  value, and will order again."}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner for 2 #A, came to $32 with tax.   Each item was enough for 2 meals over (about 6 plates total) and I was happy with the taste and quality. Noting was greasy and tasted fresh. (Ordered at 9pm)   It was above average Chinese food and I would go back there again   ...***parking is not easy at this place****"}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from here previously, and as usual, it was delicious.  No complaints at all.  The Family Dinner for Two (B) was excellent.  Again enough for another meal.  Personally for myself, I'd be even happier if they cut down on the portions slightly and increased the amount of chicken wings.  Four chicken wings doesn't cut it in this household."}
{"text":"Good taste most of the time. This is our go to place in our neighbourhood. I find it to be a bit pricey. So far good quality and quick service. We like the bonus of free wings or drinks. My usual order includes shrimp fried rice slways."}
{"text":"This small eatery is located near Willowdale and Sheppard, and today was the second time I got take out from there. There are two tables inside so take-out, pick-up and delivery is mainly what you can order. No complaints with that. I think the last time I got a Mushroom Fried Rice and one of the fried noodle dishes and maybe the spring roll. Today I got the Spicy Szechuan Beef Roll appetizer, Cantonese Lo Mein, Ma Po Tofu. Had the Lo Mein and Ma Po Tofu earlier. Both taste good together. Will try the beef rolls later. The flavor is agreeable and the yeah the ingredients taste fresh. Service is also friendly so will become a regular customer for as long as I still live in this area."}
{"text":"Spring China House has recently opened in the location that used to be Hong Yu, which if you had the pleasure of trying or want to read the reviews you will disocver it was pretty awful!  I was excited to see a another Chinese restaurant open up and take it's place. From searching on Yelp I noticed that Spring China House already has a location on Eglington with only two stars... I was still willing to give it a try!  First off, the prices are a little higher then your average Canadian Chinese food but I needed to know if it was better then Hong Yu. I would have to say Yes!  The dinner for two was great, there are two options one with beef and one with chicken. We picked the chicken option which comes with chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, chicken chow mein, chicken fried rice and two egg rolls. The only thing I would change is the sweet and sour sauce. They do not give you alot, only half a container full.   Overall the food was good, I am happy to have a simple Chinese restaurant open up close by."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese takeout/delivery places in my area. Food a little bit greasier than desired but overall a solid three. Really enjoyed the crab and cheese wontons"}
{"text":"'Lets have Chinese' is what I said tonight so I reached over to my delivery flyer stash. Thank god they flyered at my condo! Ordered general Tao chicken, chicken fried rice and egg rolls. This was able to feed two people. The food was exactly what I was craving for - greasy (in a good way), filling and addictive flavouring. Comfort food at its best. They even came back and gave me free pop after forgetting during delivery. Delivery was also free! Very good prices all around. Good customer service over the phone. If you're in the area and feeling for Chinese. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"On a positive note I didn't find any non-food object in my food but that's where the positivity basically stops.  I wish I had gone somewhere else, somewhere that can get the basics (like steamed rice) right. I'll start with what was decent. The chicken fried rice was actually palatable, it had a smoky taste to it but that brought it a unique flavour that made you want more.  In the indifferent category was the chicken chow mein. Well cooked, granted I'm not sure what one is aiming for when making chow mein, and obviously fresh chicken.  Then. Where it all went wrong. Steamed rice. How do you get this wrong? Not only wrong but awful. It was dry and hard and resembled the rice I used to eat in university when I left cooked rice out for two days. Add to that a soggy egg roll or two and you have our experience."}
{"text":"My family loves ordering from here. The service is great, delivery is quick and food is always piping hot and delicious. It's one of the better options for Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Bland, slick, goey and wrong.   Ordered $27 of food and threw out most of it.  The mixed vegetables with cashews were crisp but came in what can only be described as \"grease-water.\" Very bland and very slick to the touch. Had to rinse them off to make them edible.  The Chicken and Mushroom (Moo Koo Gai Pan) was also very bland and the chicken had lots of gooey bits hanging off it. It left me feel a bit quesy from the texture and the grease.   The Tom Yam Gai soup was a total fail. Tasted like fishy hot sauce and salt in water - and this is a dish I frequently order. The one at Spring Rolls is so much better - they cannot even compare.    VERY disappointed. Delivery took 1 hour, as well - way too long!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this location but the female who answers the phone to take orders is rude (the one that speaks English really well).  Every time I have called when she has answered she has not been polite and she rushes you to take the order.  Slow down a little...we don't know the menu as well as you do, so take it easy.  Also, the reason that you are working is because WE are ordering, so a little kindness would be nice...maybe a thank you instead of just hanging up the phone on the caller.  The food is good but she has to GO!"}
{"text":"It was a cold night and we felt like eating some Chinese (and I wanted to try something new so I could review it), which led us to Spring China House.  We ordered:  Kung Pao Chicken: This is a pretty average variation of the venerable Chinese dish. There was plenty of chicken here and no bad pieces, and the dish was rounded out with a good amount of nuts and veggies. But the sauce was somewhat underwhelming. It was a little tasteless and the spice level was disappointingly muted. This concoction was almost offensively mild.  We also ordered a couple of spring rolls and they were fine. Definitely a cut above store bought but still far from stellar.  My dining companion went with an extremely affordable combo plate that came with an egg roll, Beef with Mixed Vegetables, Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls, and Chicken Fried Rice. I tried a little bit and it tasted exactly like something you'd get from a food-court eatery or buffet, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but this was as far from authentic Chinese as you can get."}
{"text":"Ordered their lunch/daily specials:  Pork fried rice; Gen. Tao chicken; Sweet-sour pork; Fried chicken wing (10 pcs). Their spring roll sucks!  Taste-wise, they were ok. Price-wise, very expensive for its quality and quantity.  Not worth it unless you like eating expensive, low-quality food."}
{"text":"This is a take out or delivery style restaurant serving Western style Chinese food. Western style as in not authentic Chinese flavours. I got a family dinner here for 3 people here and it was enough to fill 4 of us and still have some left over. The taste was okay but I am Chinese and I guess I like real Chinese food better. This place is not for me."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but all 3 times we've ordered from there the food has taken easily an an hour and thirty minutes. Considering they are roughly 300 meters from our apt, there are better, more quicker alternatives around."}
{"text":"Good food, but prices for the popular dishes are higher than other places, and portions are fairly small."}
{"text":"Left restaurant in disappointment after only the appetizers.   The Sichuan Beef Rolls(2pc) were pretty much skimpy \"Hamburger Helper\" with no asian flavor.  $5 for two super-tiny spring rolls :(    The \"Crab and Cheese Wonton(6pc) \" , also skimpy, would have been nice except the sugar masked the flavor.  Too afraid to order an entree.   I don't mind paying more, but give us at least quality!"}
{"text":"Hubby & I ordered take out from here not long ago. It's decent food, meaning nothing was awful or tasted bad. But it's pretty standard Chinese food. Nothing really stood out to me as being amazing. Not sure if I would order here again. They don't even have rice noodle rolls which is one of my favourite dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered my meal via just-eat.ca at 6.00 pm with a  delivery time of 6.55 pm.  I called the restaurant several times and was told that they would call me back to update me - however this did not happen. I had to call the restaurant to get \"feedback\"...there was none.  On my 2nd call back to the restaurant, the female attendant again could not update me on where my order or driver was.  My order was scheduled for 6.55 pm, however it arrived extremely late (7.30 pm) and it was stone cold & bland!  I tried to call the restaurant to inform them that my arrived cold but again I was told that I would get a call back...again I did not hear from them! Not sure if I would order from them again."}
{"text":"About a year and a half ago, I wrote an update lamenting the death of China House, one of my favourite old-school Chinese haunts. It was a grand room, populated by wizened servers and a menu as secret as the ending to \"Titanic\". (Spoiler Alert: The ship sinks, and Leonardo DiCaprio goes on to play Jay Gatsby in a similar sinking ship).   I received a mysterious tip that much of the China House crew had gone on to open SCH a few doors down. At the time, I was newly-married and living in the suburbs, so quality Chinese food was the last thing on my mind.   Fast forward, I'm back in the big city, and craving some serious Sinophile satisfaction.   I visit SCH on a weekday for their buffet (I know, I know, but some times a guy's gotta do it). It's a little after one pm. The place is deserted, and the steam tables are either empty or congealed. The staff offers to make more of whatever's on the steam trays but I politely decline. Once they're actually cooking, why wouldn't I just want to hit the menu?  I return a few days later, earlier in the day. A few tables are taken, and these turn over during the duration of my visit.   Sadly, the food isn't much better.   Hot and sour soup is thick and crammed with veggies and tofu; a promising start even if the heat is a little too in my face. It's even better when I sneak a few won tons from their nearby bath into the mix.   Egg rolls are pleasantly filled with bean sprouts and assorted veggies as well. Interior and exterior are both sufficiently crispy.   Samosas are fine, but dude; this is a Chinese place (and not a Hakka one at that). I'd pass on these, along with the anemic scraps of fried fish (I fondly remember  the days before tilapia and bass invaded our menus), and vile-looking sweet and sour pork; a dinner companion chews a few rubbery morsels and gives up to get himself more noodles-they're a neither crispy nor warm, and stingy on the veg. Better to go with veggie fried rice, if you can time your visit to catch it while it's hot.  Temperature is a recurring theme here. For all of the steam trays, methinks the unit is not turned on. Items get plunked in their pans, then turn cold almost instantly.   There's also chicken in what I think is black bean sauce, beef in what I think is black bean sauce, and stir-fried veggies in...black bean sauce?   I'm sure the full menu is better, but the experience isn't worth chancing another meal here, especially when I pass the \"Conditional Pass\" public health sign on the way out."}
{"text":"So disappointed the first and last time i Ever order from this place. I ordered lobster and and lemon chicken . The money lynching driver  came to my door with two plastic trays one with lobster and one with lemon. The f×÷=%÷g lobster package contained only the balls of the lobster .... I asked for a lobster and only got the balls no head not even the legs were up to par I didn't even get a whole lobster I got a Frankenstein  and I this ish cost 51+ Congee queen give you two trays with a rubber band on each cause there's so much I'll take my loss but fu÷know this place never again   From your truly Scarborough  finest"}
{"text":"You know, it's greasy mainstream Chinese delivery food. It was exactly what I wanted and the portions were massive. Everyone knows what they're getting into with it; lo mein, spicy pork, etc. All good, and no delivery issues."}
{"text":"Oh, dear. Pretty awful.The ribs were passable, but under done - not at all interesting. The special chow mein was very boring with a few pieces of chicken, maybe two shrimp and two pieces of pork and no flavour at all. The worst was the ginger beef which consisted of soggy breaded very tough beef. First - and last - time I tried this place."}
{"text":"This is for the Shepard location  I ordered with delivery.  I don't recommend the egg rolls unless you like a filling that is only al dente bean sprouts with little flavour that get stuck in your teeth. I ended up throwing the other 2 out after giving it my first one a 3 bite attempt.  Also the Chicken fried rice tastes like smoke not savory chicken. I was disappointed in it but nothing was technically wrong with it.  General Tao Chicken was pretty good, I preferred spicing it up with the included chili sauce, and leftovers were enjoyable.  The experience overall was not what I expected and probably will remain a one time thing for me."}
{"text":"For take-out/delivery, this is exactly the type of Chinese that I am looking for: nothing fancy and a little on the greasy side!"}
