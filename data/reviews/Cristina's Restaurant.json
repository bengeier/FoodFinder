{"text":"Best food ever! Sometimes in life you have to try something outside the box.well this is that thing.you will not be sorry.try the papusa's and enchaladas they are to die for!"}
{"text":"This will be my third time in the last 6 weeks eating here!!! Love it. Food is hot, fresh and served with a smile. We last ate there Saturday after a Westview Football scrimmage and we arrived with 9 people. Promptly served, orders correct and food amazing. I wish this restaurant nothing but the best and you'll always have my patronage"}
{"text":"You MUST try this place! If you're having a hard time finding good authentic Salvadoran food, look no further. This quaint little eatery serves delicious, made-to-order South American cuisine. It gets my vote for the best papusas in the West Valley.

The staff is wonderful. Their service is excellent. The food is always fresh. This isn't fast food so call ahead or be prepared to wait. I prefer to eat in. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is okay, beans tasted like Rosarita's canned beans.  Customer service is so bad I probably came on a bad day or all reviews were written by relatives or friends.

{"text":"Stopped hear again today.  This is one of my favorite places to get one of my favorite foods, Papusa's.  Like usual the food was great and the service was fast and friendly.  If you have not tried Central American food this is a great casual place to give it a try and if you have tried  it I am sure you will not be disappointed.  the prices are competitive with your typical fast food meal but the made fresh flavor leaves even the best fast food in the dust.  They also take to go orders and always have them ready when they say they wil."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem in Avondale I went with a couple of people and we shared our meals so I got to try all of it. We had the mini pupusas (in my opinion a little dry but good in flavor) and they had the tuesday special 10 for $10, we also had a pan con pollo and it was tasty! The bread was warm and toasty and the flavors where awesome! And last we had the sopa de pata or caldo de pata..... i wish I didn't had to share this one lol it was good! The last time I had it was 12 years ago and it didn't dissapoint! Staff was friendly and we didn't have to wait long, restaurant was clean and service was great! I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"My family and I tried this restaurant and the food is amazing! We just moved from California and we had been looking for the best Salvadoran food in the Phoenix area and we finally found it! I recommend the horchata, pupusas and empanadas.  Soups are really good too it comes with hand made tortillas! 

We shall be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was very authentic and delicious. Service was good and the restaurant was clean. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very glad they opened always looking for a different kind of place to eat. 

The bean, cheese and pork Pupusas are really good! Also ordered the bananna empanadas very different from your typical 
empanadas but really good. Not good if your on a diet. 

Very friendly staff and my phone pick up orders are always ready when I get there."}
{"text":"Good spot! So far best spot for pupusas in Phoenix west valley area. Definitely returning here."}
{"text":"Family owned.  Pupusas are rich and hearty. The cabbage slaw is tangy and you get good portion sizes.  Get it to go,  inside dining is clean,  but plain."}
{"text":"Primera vez que compramos aquí y ya no regreso, no se los recomiendo. Es pura masa, las de \"rajas con queso\" eran pedacitos de chile, y aparte el curtido que si está bueno parece que te lo quieren vender por qué para 10 pupusas nomas una bolsita pequeña me querían dar. No se los recomiendo!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome- serve fast- temperature in the dining room could of been cooler so that's why only 4stars."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Never had Salvadorean Food before and was very pleasantly surprised.

Got two pork, bean and cheese Pupusa's and a side of rice and beans. These things were great and became outstanding when combined with the red and green sauce they give you. I liked the green sauce on the pupusa's and the red sauce on the rice and beans. My wife and I both loved it.

Finished with some banana empanadas and they were good as well. 

Will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Food is good,  need better costumer service,  only one waitress and kind of rude ,  other than that still pretty good."}
{"text":"We have been coming here ever since they opened, probably a total of 25 times. The food has been great every time with just two exceptions. We get the same thing every time we eat here, the #48 and #50 combo platters. Two times I have found a  6 inch long hair inside the tamale (I cannot remember what the menu calls it). One time I forgave, but twice? We will not eat here again. It is a shame because the people are so friendly and the food is usually great."}
{"text":"Seriously good food. I had no complaints.  My fiancée is from Nicaragua and we have been searching high and low for a food stop close to what she remembers. Just to see her eyes light up at the choices, and I knew we had hit the mark.

It was not crowded.....which works for me, and the prices were great. Very friendly customer service.  Spanish TV show was playing but it didn't bother me. I was hoping for a great experience for my fiancée. 

2 drinks, 5 plates of food and $30 later, we knew that we would return here again. I would have to say the fried plantains with crema and beans was a great dish and the cheese/pork pupusas were amazing."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide where to eat.  So we gave Cristina's a try.  I'm glad we did because the food was obviously made with love.  It wasn't whipped up and slopped down onto your plate, or dumped out of a bag into a microwave.  This food was homemade from real Salvadorian women.  No impersonations here.  You will find real authentic food.  I ordered the beef stew meat with rice and potatoes and my mom had the same. My sister got the shredded beef chimichanga with sauce on top.  I also ordered some pupusas.  It was all so yummy."}
{"text":"Great food. Only bad thing no beer or wine. Portions very large. Friendly service. We all were stuffed. Awesome beans!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the mixed papusas but the tamales' texture was a bit strange for me.  I'll probably go back and try breakfast as some of those dishes looked very good."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my mom and had some popusas revueltas (pork, beans and cheese filled). They wdre delicious! We also got a side of fried bananas, and banana empanadas they were both really good.

The place is nice, roomy and very clean. You order at the counter and the food is brought out to you, but the server checks on you throughout your meal. Overall a very good meal and great service. Can't wait to return and try another entree."}
{"text":"Had a craving for pupusas and this place definitely hit the spot. Delicious food and the service was great, friendly and prompt. I will be coming back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Our first time with salvadorean food and it was great! Had the mixed pupusas and chicken tamales and they were both excellent. Plenty of food for the price, a great value."}
{"text":"By far the best pupusas on the west side. Each one ranges from 1.80 to 2 buck's. The staff is super friendly also. The only thing I don't like is they charge a dollar to run debit."}
{"text":"I went to Cristina's the other day for the first time to give it a try, I ordered pupusas for me and \"caldo de res\" for my wife to go, it was a short and sweet wait of about ten minutes and while I waited a man whom I assumed was the owner kept me entertained with a pleasant conversation.

So last week all excited I took my wife there raving about how great the food is, we got there and the place was empty except for a party of four at a table. We were greeted by this young girl, she gave us a menu and since I already knew what I wanted I though it would be fast and easy. My wife ordered a fried fish and I ordered the pupusas special which came with my choice of 2 tamales or fired banana. I asked if in the interest of tasting the food I could only have 1 tamal and some fried banana but I was told that is not allowed. No problem I'll take the tamales then, can I have a chicharron pupusa instead of a revuelta? \"Of course\" she said. 

So we paid $26.80 for a $9.99 pupusa special plate and a fried fish. I thought it was pretty steep but said nothing. The girl said it would take about 20 minutes for the fish to be cooked, we said no problem we'll wait. In the meantime phone orders came in and more patrons showed up to eat there. 

Thirty minutes later someone comes in to pick up a take out order, and the patrons who were eating there not only had been enjoying the complimentary chips and salsa but actually were brought their food, while we were still waiting. 

I asked the girl why this was happening and she said fish takes that long to cook, now my wife is a good cook and we all know that fish cooks in less than ten minutes so I told this to the girl, she replied that there it takes that long and that's all she knows.

Finally 50 minutes after we stepped into the restaurant we finally got our food and we went home to eat.

When I got home I started to go through my receipt and saw that because I changed a revuelta pupusa for a chicharron pupusa they charged me for everything as it was ala carte thus the almost $27.00 bill. I am Mexican and I love pupusas but their tamales as far as I'm concerned were raw so I had to throw them away.

When I have a pupusa fix, I always go to \"El Salvadoreno\" on 75th and Thomas, I thought this new place would save me time as it is a lot closer to home, but I guess I found out now were my next pupusas will be coming from. 

Cristina's you are so hidden, if you get new customers, take care of them so they can come back to you.

As for me, as far as I'm concerned it will be worth the longer trip to 75th and Thomas."}
{"text":"I was in the area so I stopped here. The place was very clean. I asked for their specials and they had mini pupusas for $1 each with a minimum order of 10.  I believe their only choice is revueltas but that didn't matter to me as they are my preference. I ordered them to go. I really liked them but the only thing that I would change is the cheese, it was very chewy.  That didn't stop me from tearing these up. The sauce that came with this complimented the taste. I would come back here again and try other plates."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, homemade food. We tried the pupusas, the pastelitos de carne and the tamales. Everything was wonderful. So fresh you could tell they had made all of it from scratch. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Very good food at very reasonable prices. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little find.

This was my first visit to Christina's. I have spent some time in central America and each country his it's own unique food styles and flavors.

Christina's is of Salvadorian origin, and they serve  Pupusa (corn tortillas filled with either cheese, beans, chicharon, loroco or mixed) and the pupusa at Christina's are delicious and at a mere $2 each, it doesn't get much better.  You have to top your pupusa with repollo (cabbage salad) and tomota sauce; its a meal in themselves. My lunch companion had the beef flatas, Rice, and beans.  The flatas were good but the rice and beans were somewhat bland. However, in all fairness rice and beans are not one of my favorites choices.

The atmosphere at Christina's is realxing, the waitstaff is very friendly and acomdating, and the food was good. Christina's is a definite must if you appreciate good Latin food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My first stop for some good Latin food and I was not disappointed.  The restaurant was clean and having a couple of televisions on was a nice touch. They also had some Christian music going in the background, which I enjoyed on my Sunday visit.  The only downer was after seating ourselves we waited some time for anyone to acknowledge our existence. After our server did take our order though, the customer service was great. Staff answered a bunch of questions for me given I knew nothing of the menu. As for food, the little things they called papusas were awesome. You can get them filled with many things and I knocked out the pork. Loved them! Oh and did I mention,  $2 each. What a deal! 2 or 3 would fill an average person with no issue. I also tried other items as u see in my pics and they were good. I enjoyed their chicken tamales and this guy usually does not like tamales. Wife was not such a fan of the tamales. I also tried yuccas (spelling?) and they were tasty. Only item I really did not like was the fried pork. It seemed tough to me. In closing, enjoyed my first experience with Latin food and would stop by again."}
{"text":"Delicious food,popussas,enchiladas,empanadas,chichanero's all great.Tortilla chips made on site,great sauces.I tryed the yuca root which I loved so will have again...Highly recommended over the bland chain restaurants..friendly service and I love the Drinks,Horchata etc.."}
{"text":"Happy to have Salvadorian food closer to me. Had pupusas, yucca frita, empanadas and ensalada to drink. Everything was delicious and my order was ready when I picked it up. The restaurant is clean and very nice. Best of all the employees  we're sweethearts and helpful. Looking forward to dining in and happy to support a small business."}
{"text":"Prices are hella steep go to 75th ave. idk bro I was annoyed. The popusas aren't even crispy... The cheese at the one on 75th is has this crisp on the outside. Green sauce? The sauce should be red. We need more Avondale latin food, thats y i went cuz I was hungry didn't wanna drive. Dnt think ill be coming back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place!  

Positives:
  Hands down, order the Papusas.  These little pockets of goodness were yummy!  We stuffed ourselves silly with these!  Each one is only $2, which is a steal.  I also liked the Empenadas.  I would order both of these again.  My daughter ordered fries, which we all enjoyed.  The yucca was something new to try that was similar to a potato and great.  Staff was extremely friendly, we enjoyed our visit .  It was very clean inside  and we did not have to wait for a table.  Food was hot and fresh.

Negatives:
Slow initial service but food was fresh and hot so I'm not really complaining here.  I would not go here if you are in a hurry.  I did not care for the fried pork  or the tamales.   The fried pork was on the tough side.  I like traditional tamales and these were different. I realize this is because it is Salvadorian, which I am not used to.  However, my husband liked them. Why the 2 stars? I guess I just didn't care for the majority of my meal. 

Tips:
I don't have a much of a basis to be critiquing Salvadorian food on as it was my first time. Some of the flavors were strange and new to me.  This very well may be a 5 star place for Salvadorian food?! I just have no basis of comparison.  I will be ordering a la cart next time."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Makes me feel like my mom's in the kitchen again bringing all the flavors of her country to my plate. Definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to try something different and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place! In phoenix is surprisingly difficult to find pupusas, so I was so excited when Cristina's opened up in the SW valley! My husband and son have tried several different things, but I always get the pupusas - chicharron y queso, to be precise. They're amazing! The restaurant is always clean, and the service is always friendly!

My husband has been a little bit disappointed by the portion size of the ribs - his favorite item so far. I have to say that I'm also surprised, based on the price. However, he's only gotten it twice, and it's possible they've just been \"off\" days. The platanos (maduros) are also amazing - always the right amount of ripeness.

One improvement would be the ability to add tip on your credit card. I never carry cash, and it's a total drag to need to get cash specifically for tip .... and I usually forget and feel terrible!

Overall, I'm just thrilled with Cristina's!"}
{"text":"Their pupusas are decent but i felt like the ones i got were a little undercooked. Service is average at best. 

I clearly ordered 4 pupusas to go for 2 people yet they put all of them in a single to go box and didnt add in napkins or forks until i specifically asked after checking my order and seeing none existed.

The food here is good and the service acceptable but nothing about this place was above average on my visit."}
{"text":"Great food.
Great service.
Place is always velan.
Crean restrooms.
Good for kids.
I really recommend it."}
{"text":"When we got there the place was empty which concerned me a bit but I was hopeful. The food is good,  the prices are decent. Hubby ordered a platter which came with abit of everything.   The fried yucca was good,  the pork didn't seem fresh,  the tamale was ok, I'd say the best were the pupusas. My kids loved them!"}
{"text":"Good food. They don't always have menu options available and some of them are for certain days but the menu doesn't say that so it can be kind of confusing. Sometimes the cash register doesn't work and they have to go cash only. They're still getting their footing I think, so when they're fully established I think they'll be great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for purposes! Always fresh and delicious. Service has always been good to us here. We come here about once a week! My favorite dish here is cheese purposes with loroco"}
{"text":"Another great visit here. Love the food and the service is great. Had the banana empanadas and the huevos rancheros. So good and I love their horchata."}
{"text":"Pupusas were tasty but service was terrible. The server forgot about 4 things and since everyone is constantly in the back I couldn't even get their attention. I ended up canceling the parts of my order they forgot because by the time I got their attention I was almost done with my meal. They should really fix this because the food taste good."}
{"text":"A small family owned business with delicious homemade food, you might wait a little bit but totally worth it, we got a birria and a chilaquiles plate, authentic flavor and fresh made tortillas... and the kiddos got pancakes with eggs very reasonable prices.  So go in and enjoy a meal"}
{"text":"The food was super delicious, I ordered a breakfast plate with pupusas. The masa was fresh and tasty. They offer various fillings my favorite is queso con jalapeño. The service was also phenomenal."}
{"text":"Riddle me this: one pupusa costs $2 and an order of platanos is $2.99 but a plate of 3 pupusas with platanos costs $9.99.  If you do the math, it's cheaper to buy 3 separate pupusas and a side of platanos. I'm just confused why the plate is more expensive when it's exactly the same thing broken down.  I was craving pupusas and checked out this place because it's the closest to my house.  I love how they play Christian music in the restaurant.  It's about lunch time and no customers so hmmm.  Also, my food is taking a while, considering I'm the only one here.  I hope the food is worth the wait and price.

Update: the food is really good. I love how the pupusas come with both the red and green sauce. I also asked for extra red sauce and they gave me a big one so I'm happy. I will come back to this place but I will order the pupusas and platanos separately. Other than that, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Most disgusting food ever!!!!will never come back here again had the Agua the Jamaica more like sugar with a bit of tap water ,also tried the popusas revueltas as chicken tamal the tamal was not cooked right and the popusas were super greasy so disappointing ..would have gven zero stars if I could"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try Christina's and it is amazing!! I had no idea what to order, so the cashier helped me select a few dishes plus a Salvadoran beverage. They all are delicious and the price was great!! I will definitely be back, really soon!"}
{"text":"Pupusas! They are delicious! Staff is friendly. It's our fave go to lunch spot. Tuesday and Wednesday's mini pupusas are just $1 if you order at least 10. GREAT DEAL!! Love!"}
{"text":"We came down to Arizona for a business trip. We were looking for some authentic Salvadorian food and stumbled upon this restaurant! The food was delicious, authentic and overall one of the best salvadoreña restaurants I have been too. You're in for a treat! Highly recommend it if you're around the area! It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I'm bummed I hadn't tried this place before. The pupusas were delicious, they're a good size not overly greasy and the fillings were very tasty. My wife went crazy over the platano empanadas, they're a must try if you enjoy platano macho. The service was quick and courteous and the restaurant itself is very clean."}
{"text":"I must confess that this was my first time eating Salvadoran food.  I don't know much about Salvadoran cuisine except that pupusas are a staple and after my first bite, I'm kicking myself for not trying pupusas earlier.  I wish I ordered two!  

While nachos are pretty standard everywhere, I will say their beans are quite flavorful and doesn't seem to be the generic straight-out-of-the-can kind.  It's really nothing to write home about but it was still tasty and I'm glad I shared because it was a pretty big portion .  Their pupusas though...  Oh my.  Thick cornmeal tortillas filled with cheese and pork for around $2 a pop.  It came with a cabbage slaw and this watery tomato salsa.  I don't know if I was eating it correctly but I piled my pupusas with some slaw, sprinkled on the salsa, and tore into it with my hands.  Hey, it strikes me as street food and ain't nobody got time for a fork and knife.  It was bliss!  The pupusas was delicious without the slaw and salsa but with everything on it, it was refreshing and even more flavorful.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about today's lunch.

Cristina's is a nice clean restaurant with a slow but steady crowd.  The cashier was friendly, answered all our noob questions, and was patient.  Their staff size seems to consist of two people so it's a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth it.  I'll definitely be sneaking over this gem of a place while I work.  :)"}
