{"text":"The smells of BBQ travel down the street. Yesterdays visit consisted of the beef brisket dinner, greens, mac and cheese and banana pudding for dessert. Along with a cup of homemade sweet tea to wash it all down. The meat was perfectly smoked and tender. Sauce is amazing. I got the coleslaw which was a fresh, crisp and creamy delight. The baked beans popped with flavors of peppers and onions. The cornbread tasted  like poundcake, no butter or honey needed. The greens were flavorful and the mac was baked cheesy goodness. The banana pudding was like a party in my mouth and the sweet tea was perfectly....sweetened lol. Everything tasted like it was straight out of the south. The decor was awesome to look at while waiting for your quickly prepaired meal. The sounds of rock and roll bounced off the walls. The staff was up beat, friendly, provided excellent customer service and made you feel like family. You can tell everyone there enjoys what they do. The owner was very personable and was walking around greeting every table, wanting to get genuine feedback.  I know this is a newer joint in the area but I definitely predict great things on the horizon. Other BBQ spots in Cleveland, WATCH OUT!! You've got some major competition. 

Thanks for bringing a touch of the south to the Cleveland area! Your food and hospitality cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"We did take out and really enjoyed it!  The owner was personable, the place is well decorated and the food was affordable and tasty.  We look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"The perfect new lunch spot when you're craving comfort food! Ohio City BBQ offers a variety of bbq sandwiches, platters, ribs and delicious sides. The brisket was by far the best, and the sauce was great! I would say the brisket is equally as good as Mabel's but at a lower cost.

You can order for pickup online, eat at one of about twelve small tables there, or get it to-go. Our food didn't take long at all when ordering for lunch on a weekday. The atmosphere is very rock 'n' roll oldies-style, very laid back and chill. Service was friendly and helpful.

Here's where I'm docking a star: I think the sides here are perhaps not in-house recipes. My suspicion may be due to the fact that I saw a man carrying a dozen huge cans of Heinz baked beans into the back room, and the mac and cheese wasn't anything special. Ohio City BBQ, remember that sides are also a great way to shine! I'd love to try some authentic baked beans or a twist on your mac and cheese, even though I know they aren't your staple products.

The store is still getting inventory in, so drink choices were minimal. I think this place would probably be best having a soda fountain, and maybe even some house sweet tea. And beer. I know, I'm greedy."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The sauce was amazing, meat fell off the bone, and the sides were delectable. Shared the ultimate platter between three people and we all left full! Really nice staff and cool environment as well. Should be added to the list of Ohio City staples."}
{"text":"I loved me some BBQ, so when I saw some scrumptious posts on Instagram, I added Ohio City BBQ to my foodie to do list. 
The restaurant is the traditional BBQ joint set-up: order at the counter to eat in or take out. The menu options are somewhat limited, but it's to be expected. It would be nice to have slightly more flexibility, such as making your own combo of meats, etc. But since it was my first time, I wanted to try almost everything, so I did by ordering the Ohio City Platter. In retrospect, I should have gone whole hog and gotten the Ultimate because then I could have also tried the sausage. Next time.
The Ohio City Platter comes with pulled pork, beef brisket, and ribs, baked beans, cornbread, and your choice of macaroni salad or cole slaw - I went slaw. The meats are extremely tender and good quality. I chose sauce on and it was sweet and tasty. The ribs were great, but the bark is real - word to the wise with any dental work/concerns, as I chose to pick and tear versus sinking my teeth in.  The portion are huge - I had a ton of leftovers - enough for 2-3 additional meals.
I'd have to agree with other reviewers who said that what is keeping this place from being spectacular is the sides. I appreciated the sweeter take on cornbread, but it was most likely a box mix. The slaw was basic, also not homemade (I fancy myself a slaw connoisseur). The baked beans were okay - my companion immediately identified them as Bush's, and I don't doubt that they are also not house-made.  The sides are the reason for the 3-star rating. Beverages are all prepackaged from what I recall. House lemonade or iced tea would be a nice option.
BUT, I truly cannot say how attentive and friendly the staff is! Seriously awesome and lovely. The decor is also great - kinda dark, but in a good way. 
Tons of photos and info, which I liked - nothing wrong with getting your BBQ on and gathering some knowledge at the same time.
They are located right next to The Grocery and we didn't have any trouble finding parking on one of the side streets."}
{"text":"I order the ultimate platter which is good for the rest of my day. Brisket is good but I prefer more tender. Sausage is excellent, juicy! Pull pork and ribs are good. Chicken tho is a little over cooked.
One big drawback, no beer! BBQ has to have beer and they didn't have the license for that tho."}
{"text":"The Ohio City BBQ is terrific.  It's apparent the owner is passionate and pays attention to details. The ambiance says, 'BBQ joint' with the walls covered with interesting 50's and 60's memorabilia. Menu is complete and reasonably priced, but the real reason I gave it 5 stars is the food. I had the half pulled pork with half brisket on a bun, excellent, great smoke flavor and smoked to the right finish. Beans and corn bread on the side, both very tasty.  I would recommend giving this place a shot, I think you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the black guy running the counter super friendly and makes you welcome. This place is clean and lots of seating. Great additions Ohio city. The bbq is moist and tender with generous servings. The corn bead is omg love it just like grandma made this place is a must go"}
{"text":"Great bbq here! Had the Ohio City platter and it tasted great. The beef brisket and pulled pork were tender and has a wonderful smoky flavor. The ribs are pretty good too. I loved the beans and cornbread but didn't care for the coleslaw. Huge servings, definitely worth your money. We got there 20 minutes before closing and the owner was kind enough to keep the store open for us to finish eating. (Yeah the only downside/strange thing is this place closes at 7 pm). Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was great. I was waiting 7 months for this spot to open and it did not disappoint. The owner took time from his busy day to come over and speak with us for a while. The prices are reasonable. I will defenitly be back and will tell everyone they must go. The mac and cheese was great, the baked beans were awesome and all the bbq meat was amazing."}
{"text":"I think I found my Saturday Night Special!

I had a Polish Boy which requires a fork and knife since they don't skimp on the fries and coleslaw. I'll come back for the ribs since there was a wait...and if something's await and/or sold out...either the food is good...or they should restock more often!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Friendly guys and delicious Memphis Style BBQ
Brisket tender and moist, ribs were outstanding, fall off bone with just enough bite. 
Glad this place finally is open!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this was going to be a new favorite but unfortunately I must keep looking. The meats are priced adequately but I must say the pork was mushy and the brisket was very fatty. The sides were ok but were not amazing. There is no alcohol. if you are very hungry in Ohio city and have no their options go to Ohio City Bbq."}
{"text":"Maybe the best bbq in Cleveland!  Ordered a bunch when we had family over and everyone loved it.  Best corn bread we've ever had as well.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"We ate here a week or two ago and were not disappointed at all. Great barbecue, ok sides, incredible people, and overall a great vibe. 

Before I get into it though, let me preface this with Barbecue is a passion of mine and I eat at some of the top barbecue spots in the country while traveling for work. 

I ordered all their meats. The biggest stand out that was hands down the best, was their ribs. Probably the best ribs I've had in Cleveland. Falls off the bone, great smoke flavor. Just wow. Spot on. Up there with one of my favorite spots in St. Louis called Bogarts. 

Their brisket was good too, but a little on the dryer side with not as much of the fatty part as I'd enjoy. Next time I'll request a fattier cut. Still good though. More my bad for not asking. 

The sausage was another favorite part of my meal. Smoked just right. Spot on. My fiance couldn't get enough of it. 

The sides were good. The potato side is more on the mustard side, so if that's your thing you'll be happy with it. I know I was. The barbecue beans were good too. Not the best I've had though. Good flavor, not too sweet. Just lacking the wow factor. 

The sauces were good too. A spicier one and a smokey one were available for the slathering. I always recommend trying the meat first without it so you can see how well it's smoked before dousing it. And don't overdo it or you lose out on all the amazing time and energy that went into the meat in the first place. It should compliment the meat, not overpower it. (sorry, I'm done preaching.) 

Price was about what you'd expect from a good barbecue joint. 

Last but certainly not least, the owners and staff were all amazing people. Super friendly, made you smile just talking to them. You just felt welcomed here. There wasn't a hint of barbecue snobbery to be found in the place. They made a mistake on something and were very accommodating to make it right. It is them and the ribs that have solidified this as my goto rib spot in Cleveland at the moment. 

I'll certainly be back. You should too."}
{"text":"I love BBQ.  Smoked meats are hands down one of my most favorite things on earth. So I finally got to try this new addition to the Ohio City neighborhood . It should have been a lot sooner!  

I got in around lunchtime, past peak rush time. I was greeted immediately upon entering. Placed my take out order.  The food was ready within a couple of minutes.

I ordered the ultimate platter, a bit of everything (ribs, brisket, sausage, pulled pork, slaw, beans, and cornbread). Everything was spot on. Damn near perfect. The ribs and brisket were on point. Fabulous smoking favor. 

Friendly people.  Easygoing vibe to the place. Excellent food.  Plus I was actually able to park on the street nearby!   I'll be back. Glad Ohio City BBQ is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great new barbecue place that is very much needed in Ohio City .  Portions were large and sampler of beef brisket, ribs and pulled pork were tender and very flavorful.  Excellent decor with a great Memphis barbecue vibe.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My friend loves BBQ and she really wanted to check this place out. I love pulled pork, but it takes a lot to wow me in the BBQ space. The restaurant is easy to find. The inside is small, but can accommodate a large group if reserved in advance. The menu is easy to navigate. This is definitely a family owned business, as the cook's daughter and everyone in between was helping out. With the exception of the blonde lady that took my order, everyone was friendly and nice. The cook, who might be the owner, is cheerful and you can tell he loves what he does. It was a bad sign that the person taking my order did not know how certain things were prepared. To get the answers, she shouted at the cook, unprofessionally, like she was at her house. Again, everyone else were all-stars. 

The food :-) I ordered a 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich consisting of pulled pork and brisket. I did not get a side due to the answers to my questions. However, I tried the baked beans. They are not homemade. In fact, they tasted like Bush's baked beans. Yummy, but I can just eat that at home. I was asked if I wanted sauce on my food. I said yes. I am a sauce girl. The pulled pork was very tender, but it lacked soul for its natural flavor. The sauce saved it. The sauce was a bit mild and sweet. I cannot tell if the sauce is purchased or homemade, as it is a very basic sauce. I believe it is purchased. Thankfully, it is served warm over the food. The brisket lacked flavor, and I was disappointed that what I was served was cold and hard. Luckily, I ended up with a sliver of tender meat. I needed more sauce to finish my meal and grabbed what was on the table. Caution!! Every table has a different sauce on it. I ended up covering my food in what was labeled as their hot BBQ sauce. I wish I would had known that tip. I would have asked the neighboring table for their smokey sauce. It gets better...no, really. Each meal comes with pickles and a pepper. The pickles were the best thing on the plate. :-) I ate mine and my friend's and would go there again for a plate of pickles. This is not a gluten free friendly restaurant. I played Russian roulette with the sauce and did not touch the bread. 

The food is priced right for the neighborhood and market. Perhaps in time this place will grow and I will leave satisfied. You have to try it out at least once to support a local business. I will probably go back for a pickle run. {I wonder how much they would charge me.} The best thing about this place is the website. I love it. Whoever running it has done a fabulous job. It looks good on a variety of browsers. 

Extra tip: Drinks are limited and bottled (e.g. Aquafina water). 

Final tip: Count your change. I was short-changed 10 cent, but did not want to make stink about it."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! 
Delicious bbq. Had the brisket and it was so tender and flavorful. For St. Pactricks Day they had the best corner beef I've ever had. Fell off the fork because it was so tender.
All the employees are super friendly and welcoming. The owner Nav came over and made sure everything was ok and talked with us about the place. It's got great 60's pictures all over the walls and trivia facts. Great music too.
Definitely worth going to and we will come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Very cute place. Stopped in for a taste. We split a bbq brisket sandwich I got collards hubby got slaw. Good food. Liked it all. Next trip will have to include Ribs, that will be the make or break."}
{"text":"As an Ohio City resident and bbq lover I have been waiting to try this place for so long. Finally got my chance today and it did not disappoint. I ordered the half rack of ribs and the flavor and tenderness of the ribs was spot on. My only minor issue was that the ribs weren't very hot, more like a luke-warm, and I didn't really like the pickle that came with the ribs but that's a personal preference. Overall, I will definitely be back to try the other menu items and the sides."}
{"text":"Well let's start by saying I was optimistic about this restaurant because most of the Bbq  places in Cleveland area have been terrible and have closed . This place inside is great the decor its see for your self type of atmosphere inside greeeeeattt atmosphere! I ordered my food to go I ordered the platter for 25 dollars loaded down It will take me the rest of the day to eat this . Very tender ribs , beef brisket was killer ! The sauce excellent, and baked beans were a hit ! Had pieces of bacon in them .The only thing I didn't like and it's not a big deal for me was the cole slaw it seemed to be cut with too much vinegar! Corn bread super moist not a dried up piece of Jiffy lol ! The tabled has the paper towel set ups for all the messy goodness ! Love the place definitely gonna dine in next time Kudos Ohio City  Bbq!"}
{"text":"We tried Ohio City BBQ for the first time tonight and the food was great, freshly cooked very tasty and well presented. The service was impeccable and exceeded expectations. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back. Grabbed another rack of ribs for the trek back to Toronto."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had outside of Texas. Everything was delightful, but the ribs were the standout! We got the sampler pack between two and were tempted to eat another one after, just because it was so good."}
