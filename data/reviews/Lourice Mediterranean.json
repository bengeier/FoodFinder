{"text":"Went with the family and had there hummus. In like the hummus but the waitress was kinda rude so I took a star off. Overall a great family run store."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Shawarma on my way home tonight so I decided to stop at Lourice.  I hadn't been in a few years and I had also thought about stopping by again.. Unfortunately, now I remember why I haven't been in years. The shawarma was not very good, bland... Definitely not worth $7.90 (I think the server overcharged me too).  Chefs Door on Cross Ave is my new favorite for Oakville shawarma."}
{"text":"What happened here? 
It's definitely not the same place it was in the first few years since it opened. 
Dry dark chicken bits with some herbs on them is not a shawarma plate. Oily potatoes, soggy salad. Bland tzatziki. 
It's Friday night, it should be hopping and fresh food. New owners?
Wont be going back :("}
{"text":"This place has the best fries ever, hands down. Super crispy and well seasoned. We always get the chicken shawarma plate and the portions are always huge. Always enough leftover for another meal so it's really great value! Staff are quite friendly too. You can tell they put a lot of care into the foods they serve, down to the effort they put into the pretty presentation of the side salad. I always love to come here whenever I'm working in the area!"}
{"text":"See my picture of falafel's and Greek Salad! Delicious. Not had a bad meal in past 2 months with new chef Carlos."}
{"text":"I really only go here for a late night drink from time to time or when I want to look at the cute server. 

Located in the same strip mall as Monaghan's, I've twice ended up at this place after 1am simply because Monaghan's wasn't open or was over capacity. There's a small bar and they don't seem opposed to letting you hang around and just drink, though why would they when there seems to be no shortage of empty tables. 

The menu looks a bit like Montfort's (just down the street), featuring your standard mediterranean fare including falafel, schwarma, souvlaki, etc.  though it doesn't seem to have picked up the Montfort crowd yet. I had a souvlaki here once and I seem to recall it being good, but not great. For Oakville though, I have lowered expectations. 

I just realised this isn't the most informative review. But hopefully me writing about it makes you at least aware of it so you can try it out and write a proper review. Maybe I'll go tomorrow...I wonder if she's working."}
{"text":"This place had an upgrade to the menu...got rid of their regular shawarma plates..it was my go to spot for late night..quite disappointed now. Last dish I got was the large chicken shawarma plate..the presentation was good but I was really disappointed with the rice..was too mushy. Gave it a second chance since the menu was upgraded but still wasn't satisfied. Will probably wait it out until I come back again (however the owner is a really chill nice dude)."}
{"text":"So i wrote a review before on this place identifying the decline of this place and that had gotten one of thier old chefs back and after months i was in the need of a late night bite. So i went back and it was utterly shameful i witnessed multiple cross contamination events of utensils, at one point a peice was dropped on the ground and was put back on the dressing board where they make the pitas. they replaced their former cheese with what can only be described as the quarters of cheese u get on your subway sandwich. This place is utterly disguting as someone who has been a faithful customer for 7 years this is the final straw. you dont put cheese squares on a poutine. This retaurant deserves to fail at this point."}
{"text":"Carlos is back! This is great for everyone involved. He used to be the head chef, and after a brief shuffle of management, he is now back running the restaurant.

My boyfriend, my parents and I loved coming here before, and we will be back again now, the food is delicious and the servings are awesomely big!

And the he menu has been improved too. I always get the chicken shwarma, and now you get two sides included instead of one! This place has gotten revamped, and is going through renovations to make it snazzier, and it's clean now that Carlos has returned (the old management made food without gloves on, ew).

As a family we like ordering the chicken shwarma, which is juicy and flavourful. Now they have roasted vegetables as a side and they're really good! We have also had the beef shwarma on the ace baguette, and it was rad. 

My bf and I came often last year as we are students at Sheridan College across the street, and we'll keep coming back after we graduate (and move away) this year. 

Protip: Get to know Carlos! He takes time to get to know his customers and cares a lot about making the experience awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad. I have eaten the chicken shwarama sandwiches here a couple times and tried the potatoes side too.  I did not enjoy the potatoes at all..  They were too oily and hard. The shwarama however was better, probably the best shwarama I have eaten in Oakville (out of the 3 places I've tried).  Make sure to ask for turnips and hot sauce in your sandwich to give it a little more taste! 

Overall I would recommend this location to a friend who wants a decent shwarama in the area."}
{"text":"right across from the collage!!! it's the best Mediterranean food around!!! definitely will bring friend there!"}
{"text":"I hear this place has gone downhill from the people that have been here. I used to go here a year ago and when I went it was awesome. This was when the owners son worked there. They had this montfort style onion dip, the couple of times i got it was going bad. I had to spit it out. When back another 3 times again the dip was bad. Still think they made a good shawarma."}
{"text":"Second time here in a year.   Last time it wasn't a hookah lounge and there wasn't loud music playing.  I think they're trying to cater to the Sheridan College crowd based on the partitioning of the room  into a lounge and restaurant combo. Don't care for the bar right by the entrance. You walk in and people stare?!?!?  Move the bar further back and that takes care of it.

Ordered hummus, lentil soup, falafel pocket and chicken souvlaki. Hummus is ok.  Generous portion but  not as lemony as I like.  Lentil soup was good.  

Service was friendly and attentive.  Would come again but earlier in the evening to avoid the club feel..."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're in the mood for some quick and dirty mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mediterranean restaurant I have ever been. I ordered Kafta Dinner and the meat taste so sour and old, like old meat. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and my go to is always the chicken shawarma wrap with fries. It's a very good portion and very delicious. I also love their fries- very crispy. I often will order take out and the service is always quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"no free refils on fountain pop. lol seriously? cool. won't be back.


Not sure what else to say. Side of garlic sauce not included with a chicken schwarma. They don't tell you no free refills in advance.. So we could have bought bottled coke at the very least... Instead got stuck paying for flat fountain soda. Restaurant is so hot. Probably because they refuse to pay for air conditioning to. The place is empty... Now I understand why."}
{"text":"This place is great for a late nigt swarma. Great price that meets the quantity and value of the meal. It is open late which make it pretty good as well for a late night meal option. For similar or better swarma
try monforts or agabis"}
{"text":"I have been to Lourice over 20 times. When it first opened the swarmas were delicious, and the ingredients were perfectly balanced.
For the past 3 months the quality and consistency of the food has deteriorated. Their swarmas are 'sloppy', and only seem to taste good at 2 am after a pub-crawl. I suspect the problem is the constant turnover of the cook staff. 

If your looking for a great tasting swarma I would recommend Monfort down the street."}
{"text":"Pretty bad now a days. I wont go into specifics because they USED to be good, but if you want Mediterranean, you will have a MUCH better experience down the hill at Monforts. I wont be coming here any more."}
