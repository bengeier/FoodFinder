{"text":"The owner waited on us and made sure that everything was up to our expectations. We had the falafel for an appetizer and then main dishes of okra stew and the fountain sauté with lamb. Everything had wonderful flavor especially the lamb which was cooked to perfection.  I would easily return for another meal."}
{"text":"Really fine food. Went with a large family group that included vegetarians, after consulting Yelp. These reviews are spot on! We had babaganoush (very tasty!) hummus, and Barak rolls, which were all very pleasing. Strongly suggest the Babaganoush. Then,  chicken shawarma, chicken shish, and lamb sauté and vegetable sauté. All was nicely spiced, and the sauté very tomatoey. (Fresh tomatoes tasted home grown) and the baklava is among the best I've ever had! Friendly service too and tasteful decor. I will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food, and I was raised on Middle Eastern food. Very reasonable prices. Homey and comfortable atmosphere. Service was very attentive, efficient and friendly! Baba and baked ride pudding were delicious. Can't wait to go again, take my parents and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Hi I'm from Kuwait ..the restaurant is very very clean  and Cousy its remind me about Paris..  the food is perfect and the mazza especially the hot one you should to try it Waw  ..you should to try the mixed grill Waw ..the owner is very very welcoming person ..and the shisha is very good to not strong but light ..and the good thing is the price .."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. The chicken shawarma was well marinated and grilled. Ordering tea after the meal was refreshing and relaxing. Environment was good, and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"Our first time here and had a great dinner. Our server explained all of the dishes and made reccommendations that hit the spot. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and the service is always on point. Also while you're there the hookah is great and they have a wide variety of flavors. I highly recommend the lamb kabob it's the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad last weekend. The food was awesome. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and it came with French Fries. Both were very very delicious. I didnt eat all my food so I finished it later las night and my meal tasted great after being reheated (I am not sure if this means anything but I wanted to note it). Futhermore, the Hummus was some of th ebest Hummus I have had in quite some time. I look forward to coming again in the immediate future."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I went with a friend tonight who knows the owners.  The food was great.  I am Italian; though, I am a huge fan of Lebanese food!!!  I have been going to Alladdins for many years and love that this new Lebanese restaurant has opened in Westlake.  We shared Fatayer cheese and spinach pies, stuffed grape leaves, Tabbouleh, Falafel sandwich, and Hreesh for dessert!  I am stuffed!  The food was GREAT!!!!  I will defintely be back as this is my new favorite restaurant!  Keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit and will definitely return. The food is authentic and very good. The service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Soon became one of our favorite places. Decor is warm and inviting, but the food is outstanding. We are on a mission to try everything. The staff is so nice, willing to make your time there relaxing and explaining new dishes for us so we don't feel dumb! MUST TRY!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ordered take out. We enjoyed the food very much. It was ready when we got there and we received friendly service."}
{"text":"The food is above average, great tabbouleh and AMAZING DESSERTS. The reason I can't give it a perfect score is that the waitress, while very knowledgeable and a really cool person, was often absent from the dining room for an extended period of time, making it difficult to get her attention at times. But she has great recommendations and is really helpful and easy to talk to. 

Definitely try the desserts--they're what makes this place stand out from other places in the area."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, restaurant is beautiful, and the service was great! This is my fifth time returning and I recommended it to all my friends."}
{"text":"I ate at the Fountain Cafe in Westlake Fountain a few weeks ago. It is Middle Eastern food. I enjoyed the food tremendously. It's a small family style restaurant. If you don't know what you want I suggest to try the Fountain Mixed Grille because it comes with a little bit of everything beef kabobs, shish tawook, chicken shawarma which is all served with rice pilaf and vegetables. Also try their humus & pita bread. The food was delicious and superbly cooked. They give you a lot of food, so if you get the Fountain Mixed Grille it is enough for two people."}
{"text":"I am SO happy this place is on Uber eats now. The portions are generous and everything is decently priced. Everything I've eaten here has been fresh and delightful! 

Today I ordered the barak rolls. They are to die for. Give them a try! They have a crispy, buttery, flakey crust and a deliciously salty melted cheese inside. They kind of remind me of cheese empanadas! Yummy.

I also love their fattouch salad. I get it every time. It has an amazing herb dressing and all the vegetables are fresh. I'm not even a vegetarian but I usually tend to eat meat free here because all of their vegetables are SO good! I highly recommend this place for a vegetarian dinner.


Their meat is also amazing and tender. Shawarma is always on point and never disappoints. I have never had room for dessert because of the filling portions, but their desserts always look fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to get 2 sandwiches; a shawarma and falafel along with baba ghannouj. The sandwiches were made with tortilla! Are you kidding me?? And the eggplant lacked tahini sauce. For a middle eastern, this place is barely eatable!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! This is my second time eating Mediterranean food. The first place, blahhhhhhh. This place is DELSIH!!!! I got the beef shish-kabob. The meat was so tender and delicious, my husband got the beef shawarma platter. He was very pleased. And of course I can not forget dessert!!!! The baklava, wowzas. Out of this world!!! Totally recommend this place!! If you drive by and have a empty tummy, definitely stop and get some yummy food!!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night at 6:15 and were able to be immediately seated. The waiter was very good and helped us decide on our choices. The food was excellent, large portions and reasonably priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here a few times and are always impressed. Delicious food and a family restaurant feel. It's not cookie cutter food and it's not prepare frozen chain restaurant food. Portions are nice and the food seems like it is very fresh/quality. If you like Mediterranean food that seems very authentic you should definitely give this place a try, you won't be mad you did! My recommendation: fattoush salad and the Shawarma chicken."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was fantastic. Our server was super friendly, knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. My group shared appetizers and really liked the mahamarra and kibbeh. I had a delicious frozen mint lemonade that was like a nonalcoholic mojito. For dessert I got the rice pudding which was good but the knafeh I tried was amazing. Probably the best dessert I've tasted in a while."}
{"text":"The food is great.  I could go on and on about all of the dishes, but I suggest you experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"Had a great carry out meal tonight.  First visit and Mo was very accommodating and the food was delicious.  Everyone in our party appreciated the fresh quality foods.  Yum would use them again."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Westlake with outstanding food and personal service.  Started with tabooli that was fresh and nicely seasoned.  Ordered chicken shawarma with rice and vegetables and lamb shank.  All food was very authentic, made from scratch, and delicious!  Baklava-to die for!  Enjoyed talking with the owner and son. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not familiar with this kind of food so it was kinda risky for me to try this place.  Been to Aladdin's a few times and never really cared for anything there.  I decided to live on the edge.  Dragged my poor husband along for the taste sampling.

Looked at the menu and scratched my head.  Pointed to a few things to order 'cause I can't pronounce the entrees.

Fabulous and fresh tasting food.  Quality ingredients presented very well.  I was expecting to leave most of this unfamiliar food behind on my plate.  Instead, I ate everything.  Rice was perfectly cooked, too.

If I had a Mediterranean grandma, this is how her food would taste.  Gotta find myself some of that tea I ordered with my meal.  It comes in a cute little cup.

Most importantly, the new owner cleaned up the building.  I like that.  Nice and bright looking.

Go there now before this place becomes popular and you'll have to wait a long time for a table."}
{"text":"5stars for the quality of food. So yummy!  The service is very efficient. Ambience is simple and elegant. The menu is Mediterranean. The quantity is quiet abundant for the price. The location is convenient but not in the fancy part of town. Parking is available easily. Weekdays around 5pm was not busy at all. 
Coming to the food. The falafel was so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken Shawarma plate with bulgur and salad was tasty and the chicken was so tender and flavorful. The shish tawook had two skewers of chicken kabob well done. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We tried this new restaurant out and ordered a cold appetizer platter with four different items for $15.  Each of the choices were excellent and they even threw in an extra bag of pita bread for no additional cost.  Would highly recommend for anyone looking for good Middle Eastern food!  We also ordered three different desserts that were delicious and worth the $3-5 dollar price for each, baklava came with three pieces for $3 and was very flavorful."}
{"text":"I took my wife for dinner at the fountain cafe after a friend recommended it. i wasnt expecting much from this place, but, we were really impressed. we tried the hummus which was perfectly done and reminded me of the one i used to eat back home. falafel and kibbe were both phenomenal. we shared the mixed grill and it was delicious. the meat was tender, chicken was juicy and the portion size was perfect for 2. coming from the middle east, and having tried all middle eastern restaurants in cleveland metro area, the fountain cafe is by far the best. food is authentic, cooked to perfection. the restaurant is clean, decor is very nice, and patio is great for sunny days. waitress is very friendly. overall amazing experience. would definitely go back every week to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Food took an extremely long time to come out. The first time they brought my salmon out, it was extremely burned white fish of some sort. After I returned it, they brought me another very burned white fish that reaked of charcoal and lighter fluid. My mom ordered the lamb but it was clearly beef even though they insisted it was lamb. Very disappointing. Appetizer sampler was very good though."}
{"text":"Being Syrian myself, I've always been disappointed with the options for Middle Eastern cuisine on the west side of Cleveland. Thank goodness for this place. Never go to Aladdin's ever again my friends. The only negative is that you can't have a beer with lunch here but that's ok.

Excellent food, very authentic and the service is efficient. 5 stars mainly for the food though. The dinner platters are executed to perfection."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I went a couple times when they first opened, even had a supper club here, but the owner seems to just have become cantankerous and money hungry over time. Menu has also changed with increased prices and less options. In speaking with the owner tonight he has a \"too bad, don't care\" mentality towards his customers. I was about to spend $60 on a large order and all I wanted was to swap the rice/bulgar ($4 al a carte) that came in one meal for a scoop of hummus ($6 al a carte) instead. I would have paid the $2 difference but he would have none of it. Just wanted to talk over me and yell that the \"rice is complimentary and not included in the meal price and no substitutions! Take it or leave it!\". 

Well I left it. Cancelled that order fast. Previously everyone was so friendly and they didn't mind such a small swap. Now, whoa! What a terrible impression he just left. Lost a customer for life. 

The food was good, but with the high prices and such a negative change in customer service I will never order from here again. I highly recommend you check out any other Middle Eastern/Mediterranean place on the west side. Al Pita in Rocky River just opened up, give them a try. Or Aladdin's, Istanbul Grill, Taki's Greek... heck you could go cheap and tasty with Oasis, Dolce Wraps, Sittoo's, Ferris Deli, Boaz Cafe, Naf Naf Grill, Falafel Xpress,Ya Hala, Mezza, etc.



**Update:
Darla K. who works at The Fountain posted a 5 star review complaining about my review. You're not allowed to write a review for a business you work at and your review has to be about your experience at that business, not a complaint about a customers review. So it's been reported for breaking the rules. I'd just like to point out this pettiness helps to prove my point that the customer service is bad. Also, I think Darla needs to look up what slandering means as nothing in my review is false - she confirms I spoke with the owner and asked to substitute the side of rice for the side of hummus. Telling me no isn't the problem, being unreasonable and rude about the request is."}
{"text":"If the decor had a better feel, and they had a liquor license, this would be a 5-star for me (which I don't give out often). This is by far the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern Cuisine I have had in Cleveland. I was the only patron in the place, so I was a bit unsettled going in, but I like to check out new places, and I had been meaning to stop in. 

The tabbouleh salad was superb. I also ordered the grape leaves; phenomenal, the kibbeh; maybe just a tad over (and I mean just the slightest), and the mixed grill; lamb, beef, chicken, with bulgur. All terrific. 

Service was excellent (of course then again I was the ONLY customer). 

As I mentioned they don't have a liquor license (for religious reasons) and the place is a bit \"divey;\" it's the old Frankie's which was tired to begin with, but if you can get past the Elks Club chairs, the vinyl table cloths, and not having a drink with dinner, Fountain Grill and Café is a must-try for you. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Beautiful evening on the patio.  My favorite entree is the Shish Tawook with bulgar.  The tabbouli and labna appetizers were delish, too!"}
{"text":"We were out for a drive, and ran across this place as an option for dinner. What a wonderful surprise. The food and service are excellent, and the owners and staff are both friendly and warm. I highly recommend checking this great little cafe out."}
{"text":"Tasty dishes, lots of options and authentic middle eastern flavor.  We had the warm sampler and mixed grill, all the options were very good"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time--really impressed. The atmosphere and service were outstanding but the food was even better. If you are not accustomed to Middle Eastern favors it will be a pleasing change for you. If you are used to them then you will be thrilled. We had the beef shawarma and lamb shish kebob--both were great. The mixed vegetables were slightly pickled which was a surprise but very pleasing. Bulgar is definitely better than rice. We'll be going back as there were several things that looked very tempting. Moe (hope I spelled it right) you were awsome!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean in Cleveland! Stopped in for lunch with my dad and daughter; we ended up trying almost all of the mezzes. The service was impeccable, even once they got busy. 

 The hummus is garlicky and delicious,  the labne dip is creamy and tart,  the tabbouleh has the perfect amount of lemon juice, the vegetarian grape leaves remind me of my Sitto's, and the kibbeh and spinach fatayer were amazing! We can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of most Mediterranean dishes, and The Fountain's was no exception. I ordered the chicken shawarma platter. The chicken was excellent and deliciously seasoned. It was accompanied with a cucumber salad (which was equally excellent, and refreshing), and some rice pilaf. All around everything was really tasty, and I appreciate having a healthy lunch option.

The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star in my book is the pricing. Everything on the lunch menu (takeout, anyways) aside from the sandwiches were $15-20 and up (mine was $15) which is a bit pricey for what this place is. I'm honestly shocked that so many other people noted price vs. portion sizes as a selling point in their reviews."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, ambiance, and service! We just happened in, as we were passing by. We are from Cleveland but not living here full-time, so it was a nice surprise to find a new restaurant! Wonderful Mediterranean food! Try it---you'll love it. Nice folks!"}
{"text":"This place has great Middle Eastern food with some excellent Syrian surprises dotting the menu as well. Those Syrian dishes are really hard to find on menus anywhere else in town, and they are a good reason to check this place out. If you're feeling less adventurous, they offer all the usual suspects on the menu as well."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We had the Fountain Mixed Grille, so we could try everything. All the meat were fresh and tasted perfect. The mint lemonade was unique. So happy to have found this place, just wish it was closer to our home. Can't wait to try more items from the menu next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food, totally unexpected in Westlake!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!  We ordered the Baba Ghanoush to start.  It was my first time trying it and I absolutely loved it.  I can't wait to go back and get more.  My main course was the Lamb Shish Kabob with bulgar - also delish!  Our waiter was super nice and helpful with dish selections.  I like the location, easy to access and lots of parking.  And the restaurant itself has big windows receiving great light.  Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Not inexpensive, but SO satisfying! Friendly, informative service, pleasant, clean atmosphere, and delicious food. The beef and chicken on the Mixed Grill were amazing - so tender and flavorful. Do choose the bulgur as a side - it was feather light and simply perfect. And try the Knafeh for dessert. Our  server recommended it, and he was right - it was quite special. Cheesy, crunchy, sweet bliss."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been to this restaurant. The cold appetizer plate is EXCELLENT,  though they changed up the items at dinner .

We had a regrettable experience this time. They are obviously having chef issues. I ordered lamb kabobs. I received beef. The waitress returned it to the kitchen and came back two minutes later insisting that the meat on my plate was lamb. I know lamb...it was beef!  My husband ordered the beef kabobs and received the exact same meat that I got! Though I was looking forward to lamb, the beef was excellent.

My poor son ordered salmon and both times that the plate was brought out, the unidentified white fish was charred beyond edibility. 

They did not charge us for the fish and gave us 5% off the bill.

If you take children, DO NOT ORDER THE SPAGHETTI! Their version of spaghetti and meatballs is wide egg noodles with chopped up tomatoes and spicy beef meat balls...no sauce! It was terrible! 

We may give this place one more shot because the appetizers and salad are very good."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant!  The chicken soup, the shish kabobs were and the shish tawook platters were amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic food! Coming from someone who eats Mediterranean in a daily basis. Meat was tender. Dipping sauces were flavorful. I recommend! And the fried cheese things forgot what they were called! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - every choice was exceptional.  Quaint, warm setting.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"So I've been here quite a few times. I usually take out meals for my whole family when I don't want to cook. I order mixed grill, okra stew, grape leaves, spinach pies and kunafeh for dessert. I have also tried their rice pudding. The meats are usually cooked very nicely. They come with grilled peppers and onions and a very small amount of rice or bulgur(which is very tasty and I always wish I had more). I am accustomed to Mediterranian food that has an abundance of rice. I forget that not all Mediterranian cultures eat rice and these are definitely the pita bread type. Extra rice is expensive for what you get and the stew I feel requires it. The stew we like. It is okra and peppers in a red sauce. I have to provide more rice for my family. The grape leaves are fine, I just prefer the lemony types and these are not that type. These are more like the beef broth type. I do enjoy the spinach pies or fatayer, I have the same preference though as with the grape leaves. These are not the lemony fatayer but they are good. The kunafeh is crunchy buttery cheesy loveliness. One will serve 2 if you are not greedy for it. The rice pudding was really lovely, as well as the Turkish coffee that I have brought home a time or two. The call in pick up service is 25 min. and runs smoothly every time. The staff is amiable and one day I may come to dine-in on the outside terrace because it looks pleasant from driving by. I will add one caution to the owners. Consistency in portion sizes is very important. Please look into that, concerning stews especially."}
{"text":"This location has been a few different restaurants over the years. It's been updated a little and now it's The Fountain. Serves Mediterranean type-food. Yum. 

We started with the hummus & kibbe as appetizers. The kibbe was really good, some of the best I've had. 

For dinner I ordered the large size tabooli plate. Man do I love tabooli - I could eat pounds of it. This was nice and fresh tasting. 
The hubs had the chicken shawerma platter. The spices on there were quite nice. 
I also tasted the shih tawook- very good. All of the meat was very tender and cooked perfectly. 
Also had a taste of some desserts. Delicious and sweet. 
Although this place is kind of off the beaten path, it's definitely worth a try! The food is good!"}
{"text":"I met up with 8 lady Yelpers (:D) for a supper club gathering on a Wednesday night.  The Fountain is a small, cozy restaurant in Westlake that occupies the building formerly held by Frankie's Italian Cuisine.  I wasn't aware that Frankie's had closed until I pulled into the lot.

Our server, Mohammad, was very welcoming and he did a great job of explaining the menu items for those that haven't had Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food before.  I had been to Aladdin's and Mezza (just a few miles west of The Fountain) before, so I was quite familiar with most of the food. We were the only table there that night for dinner, so service was spot on.  Unfortunately, they don't have a liquor license...boooo.  I ordered a Turkish coffee.  It was pretty strong...similar to espresso.  

We started off by ordering a bunch of appetizers for everyone to share.  They have a combo deal where you can choose 4 cold appetizers or 3 hot appetizers for $15.  We had hummus, baba ghanoush, Mahamarra, and tabbouleh, all of which came with pita triangles for dipping, falafel, kibbeh, Fatayer pies, and Barak (Obama) Rolls.  I honestly really liked them all!  The Mahamarra had a nice bit of spice to it, but nothing overwhelming.  

For my entree, I ordered the Fountain Mixed Grille - a nice combo plate of Shish Tawook, Chicken Shawarma, beef kabob, and veggies with a side of rice pilaf or bulgur.  It took a little while for the food to come out because they make everything fresh to order, but it was so worth the wait!  This was one big plate of meat!  Everything was juicy, nicely seasoned and cooked just right. (see uploaded photo)  I can't believe I managed to eat it all!  It was so good and I was pretty full so, I didn't have room for dessert.  The owner came out to describe the dessert options available. A number of the girls ordered dessert and they all seemed to like it!  (Check the photos) Maybe next time, I'll order a smaller entree, so I'll have room for dessert. 

After we were finished, the owner came to thank us for coming in for dinner and the Turkish chef even came out to say hi.  Everyone was very friendly and appreciative of our business.

It was a great evening of great food and friendly people.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great family run spot for authentic middle eastern cuisine.  We sat on the patio and brought the kiddos.  Service was very personal and helpful offering great suggestions.  Lots of menu options.  We will be back!"}
