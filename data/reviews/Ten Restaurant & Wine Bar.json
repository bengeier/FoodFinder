{"text":"Absolutely flawless and seamless organization!!!!! Booked a surprise party in the loft area in November and was so impressed! From booking the reservation to paying the bill in the end - the experience all in all was just fantastic. We were easily accommodated and reassured about our booking, and once we arrived the staff was absolutely fantastic and the service was thorough. This was my first time here and I cannot wait to go back and try it it again! 
Good job to all the staff, our entire group was blown away and will definitely be back for future party bookings as well!"}
{"text":"attentative staff and exceptional food. I like the outdoor seating area and that some nights they have live music. great location, as after dinner you can take a walk along the harbourfront. Really enjoyed the lobster rolls, lobster poutine, and calamari! The calamari had a unique flavour that sets it aside from what you usually expect when you order it, but in a good way. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here last night it took 4 hours from start to finish 

The table plates of meat was great 

Caesar salAd pass the other salads look way better opt for those ...

The burger was awesome ! The perch was absolutely terrible !!! I love fish and could t even take more then a bite .. Half the fish was raw had to be taken back .. 

The staff was great drinks pretty pricy but the restaurant Is nice atmosphere 

All in all I would never eat here again ... And I'm not a picky person at all ... Sorry for the bad news on this restaurant ..."}
{"text":"I have dined here multiple times. Each time the food is consistency good and the service is good. The food is served reasonably quickly. I like that the have booths and tables/chairs..."}
{"text":"This place isn't sure what it is really; is it a bar - a nightclub or a restaurant? When you don't know what you are, it isn't a big surprise when it disappoints. Shame really, the location is excellent and Port Credit is quickly becoming a go-to location. Only been twice but on both occasions this restaurant was full of really obnoxious twenty something year-olds, staffed by inexperienced kids who don't have a clue on how to be & act like professional wait-staff. Food was nothing to brag about and the interior ambiance is poor (& loud). Haven't been back in ages; always surprised to see they're still open for business."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiance to celebrate our anniversary. The atmosphere was really nice and the staff are super friendly. We had the lobster roll and that was good (a little too greasy for my liking but overall the flavor was good). We had the new york steak and we ordered one as medium rare and the other medium. Both steaks came out medium. My fiancé didn't want to say anything to the waiter and decided to just eat it. I felt bad Cuz I could tell he wasn't enjoying it. As for my steak it was cooked to my liking but.... the steak was quite chewy and tough. The flavor was nice though.  Since we spent majority of the time eating our main, Unfortunately this left a rather not so pleasant impression on us. As much as the service was awesome, they lose quite a lot of points for their food."}
{"text":"Ten, the place itself is nice. 

The food was terrible. Parmesan dusted fries ?? Really ?? 

Just go to Gino's pizza down the street. 

That's all I've gotta say."}
{"text":"Brad is an amazing server. He is attentive and very knowledgeable at his job. He provides amazing customer service. Ten restaurant is lucky to have him"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a colleague.  We went there on a Tuesday evening, four in our party.  We had reservations, and one of our party was running late, so spent some time at the bar waiting for the fourth.  Bar service was very good, televisions on sports, you know the drill.

Our table was held for the complete party.  We ordered appetizers - i recommend that you try the Devils candy, very good!

I had a fresh fish available that day as an entree.  The meal was served at the appropriate temperature, went well with the wine selection we made (great wine selection at this place).  The portion size met our level of satisfaction.

We finished our dining experience with coffees and desert, a good taste combination to cap off the evening.  My cappuccino was especially good.
 
Service was good, but as the evening went on, our server got a bit busy, and we were looking for her to bring the bill.  This was also the time at which the bar was getting busy, with people coming in to hear the live band.  Of course it got pretty loud with the music, and our ability to converse was diminished.

I was satisfied with this restaurant and would return, but keep an eye on the time spent there, try to finish up prior to the live music starting, especially if there with a group wanting to have conversation."}
{"text":"Waitress was great, remembered all our names in a group of 14 people! Food actually came out pretty fast (I was worried as last time it took forever) & the fish tacos were good. 

They advertise $5 martini'S but it is $6 & only 1 is that price. 

My friend got the pasta & meatballs. She cut into one & saw the ground beef was pink, mentioned to server who adamantly defended them & said it wasn't possible for them to be undercooked as they sat in sauce all day & that the lighting was slightly red. She was wrong. The insides of the meatballs were RAW. Full-on red/pink could-almost-see-blood RAW. Needless to say my friend didn't eat them.

Crowd that night (a Friday) was a strange mix of girls in their 20's & older 40/50's cougar looking women & a few older guys. Music was old school & brought back great high school memories.

I don't think our group will be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Since the management change is not the same place anymore. Bartenders and servers are not smiling at all and to get their attention u need to wave or you will wait forever. The new manager is as rude as f...ck. will never go there again"}
{"text":"Atomosphere is nice, but food is horrible, salad wasn't wasted, limp kale, main course (blacken salmon was ok) rice and veggies were soggy and over cooked... for what they charge $22 main, $15 apps, they should invest in a better cook.... cuz they certainly don't have a chef working that kitchen."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the restaurant side is busy- but the dance floor is quiet.  The food is delicious- but expensive.  Also, there is a mandatory Service Charge on your bill. My only complaint is that its extremely hard to flag down a server.  They don't visit your table enough.  However, classy ambience to host a dinner-and-dancing with friends.  The dance floor is small, but never crowded. There's usually only like 4-10 people on the dance floor at a time. Its really warm on the dance floor though, they should put a fan there! The best thing about this place is the patio outside. Fresh breeze, as you are close to the water. Nice place to have a few drinks with friends, on the patio."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I was excited to try this restaurant out, but of course it was Saturday night and all the tables were reserved. We were told we can sit at the bar where we were surrounded by empty tables marked reserved. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes before being offered water... We waited another ten minutes and still nothing but the water- not even a menu! We decided to get up and leave as the seating arrangement and lack of service would most likely prove to be an issue. 
Unless you've made a reservation and are willing to wait out the exceptionally slow service, I wouldn't recommend you go to TEN."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 8 people on Friday October 21, at 7:30pm to celebrate my birthday.  I have come to ten wine bar in the past (at least a couple of years now) and always remembered the good food and drinks and was very excited to celebrate with good friends, some who have come from out of town just to have dinner. 

Our waitress started off friendly enough and was attentive to all my guests who came in but seemed to loose interested quickly and we had to go personally ask for her when we were ready to place our orders.   From the beginning, our drinks were wrong.  I asked if the bartender could make a pomegranate martini, which was by far disgusting- I later learned it tasted exactly like the supposed feature cherry brandy martini of the evening. 

The appetizers were brassiness!  3 tiny tasteless crab cakes for how much money??? The vegetarian tasting looked like left over burritos toppings  and was inedible - we all tried our best to eat it, but it was bland, soggy and visually unappealing. We were so exited when the mushroom dish came out, it smelled and looked wonderful, however the bread that was served with it was stale, and the mushrooms had no flavour at all.  At this point we were so disappointed, but we were hungry and aside from the martini, we didn't think the drinks could get worse. 

When placing our orders, two friends ordered the burger, they were not told it was a $4 upgrade for some disgusting deep fried peameal bacon (if you are going to charge extra for a topping, make sure the customer is aware of this beforehand).   The burgers were horrible, and the french fries were under cooked.  My sister asked if she could get the grilled cheese that was on the kids menu, and was happy to pay full price for it.  The grilled cheese came was so unappetizing and sad.  I don't even think there was a full kraft single slice on the untasted bread that literally came with maybe 15 fries.  I ordered the spicy pasta dish and was told that there was A LITTLE bit of sausage in the dish. I told our server that I was new to eating meat and was hesitant with how much sausage was in the dish, our server assured me it was very little it was served on top of the pasta like a garnish.  My meal came with 6 long noodles and full of overcooked chewy sausage. My friends who ordered the squash pasta and salmon said the dish was fairly tasty but the portion sizes were way too small and they were left hungry.  FYI WE WENT ACROSS TO THE IRISH BAR AFTER AND ORDERED PROPER DRINKS AND FOOD. 

My sister called the manager over, who is all fairness, seemed genuinely sad that our meals were not up to par and did try to make it up to us.  I told him that I has been conversing via e-mail with some other staff about this birthday dinner and have lost all faith in the service with Ten Wine Bar.  He did try his best to persuade us into ordering additional meals that he would make sure came out properly, and quickly got the replacement fries for my friends with the burgers.  This manager did send over 6 shots, which he told us was their brandy cherry martini feature of the night that was divided into shots- I do wonder if anyone tasted the drink feature of the night, or perhaps the shots (including my martini in the beginning) were purposely watered down.  They tasted awful and reminded us of diluted children cough medicine. 

Our waitress appeared to disappear after our main dishes were served, we never saw her again until my friend has to leave the table and call her from the bar, telling her we wanted our bills.  She did not ask us if we would like tea/coffee/dessert, but miserably handed us our bills.   The manager did one thing right by taking the pasta and grilled cheese off our bills, but I felt awful that my friends has to pay for their crappy meals, included $4 for bacon and sweet potato fries, which was we were never told would be an extra charge!

All of the ladies in my group are young professionals, accustomed to dining out at expensive restaurants, ordering drinks and wine by the bottle , we have no problem paying for good quality food and service, and were anticipating a long night filled with excellent food and endless wine/drinks, however we were greatly disappointment.  I have never been so embarrassed in selecting a restaurant, and I kept apologizing profusely to my guests and ended up buying everyone drinks at the other bar we went to after, trying to make up for the dinner. 

What happened to the fantastic restaurant I used to eat at?  Where the staff went above and beyond, and the food was simply delightful?  Now, the menu obviously doesn't do justice, as the food descriptions are wrong and leave things out, and the prices do not reflect the portion sizes or quality.   What makes things worse is that the restaurant wasn't even that busy!  

Please do yourself a favour and look up your reviews at zoomato, TripAdvisor and yelp- you will find that it is not just me that was horrible disappointment."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for lunch with their $10 special mane, but recently they made all portions smaller, so its not as filling. Food is very good and well plated though"}
{"text":"The best place in Port Credit. Great wine selection - I always get a flight to taste different ones. Food is good, and service is very friendly. Patio is nice in the summer."}
{"text":"My steak was salty but quite good. 
One waitress very pleasant and attentive. The other quite snotty. 

The price for a 2 oz martini: $15.

Outrageous."}
{"text":"I have been to the place 3 times so far. The first visit was great and the food superb, although the service was a bit....eh. I told myself will give it a try. Disappointment. The third time was a complete disaster. Waited for 75 min for our appetizers. Bottom line this a place for people who go there for the drinks, it's not a place for gourmet folk who want to eat a good meal out. I have given this place 3 opportunities to impress me. They failed miserably with a lousy and inconsistent service, hence my review."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!
On November 1st myself and a group of 12 friends went to Ten restaurant for a surprise party. Our reservation was for 10:00 and we showed up around 9:30. We were told that our table was not ready yet and that it would be ready for 10:00, so we waited by the bar. When 10:00 came around I went back to the hostess and asked on the status of our table, she told me that the current party just received their dessert and shouldn't be to much longer. I told her that this reservation was for a surprise party and that the birthday girl is on her way. The manager came over and said the same thing, but she could move us upstair to a table for 6 until our table became available. We went upstairs and 12 people waited around a table of 6, we waited 20 minutes and no one came over to us once so we asked for the manger again. Another manager came over and was extremely rude, when we asked what was being done about this situation she said \"she is really busy right now.\" To which I thought but isn't this your job? And every time we looked over at her she was on her phone behind the bar. Management started telling us that our reservation was for 10:30 (which it was not) and that this is not their fault. Meanwhile our table sat for maybe 10-15 minutes dirty and empty until someone decided to clear it and seat us. Once the birthday girl arrived we decided to stay because a lot of planning went into this night. This was our mistake, we should have left after they way they treated us initially. No one ever apologized or came over to see how we were doing, the managers literally stood in the corner the whole night and stared us down. 
After we paid our bill which was easily $1500, security came over and told us to leave, because one of the members in our party bumped into the manger on the way up the stairs. Which was completely ridiculous, it's a small stairway of course people are going to bump into each other!! My boyfriend went to the head of security and explained the situation and he basically said that what the management was doing was ridiculous and that we could stay if we wanted to. 
At that point we decided that we had spent enough money at this place where we were treated with no respect and we decided to leave. As someone who frequents many restaurants I have NEVER been treated like I was at ten restaurant. The management was HORRIBLE and did not care about their customers at all. I hope you take this review into consideration before you go to this restaurant and if not my review, maybe the numerous other negative reviews you can find on this restaurant. Management may not care about the 12 customers they treated like garbage but we ALL are going to make sure everyone we know does not go to this establishment ever!"}
{"text":"No happy Hour in Canada, eh?  Living now in the US of A, when visiting North of the border, I make it my mission to try & find deals to eat out - i did well this week!  

These guys have 1/2 off all appies M-F 4-6:30 - Yum! Flatbreads were yummy, others like the hot shrimp, hot cheese dip was good.

Nice patio which faces to an inner courtyard.  GR8 service.

Inside is classy bar or sexy booths.  So glad i stumbled apon it!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I celebrated my 25th birthday here a couple years ago and had an amazing time.  Their food is ...ok.  I definitely go back for a night out."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere slightly overpriced but still worth the time and effort to go only wish it was open later at night"}
{"text":"What a great Monday Night.  Met up with a few friends at Ten Restaurant & Wine Bar in Port Credit last Monday and was blown away by the half price wine menu they have.   huge selection of wine by the bottle for half the price...no strings attached.  Also had a great Piano Bar feel going on with a live piano player as ambience.  Had some great appetizers.  Cheese stuffed figs, Charcuterie board & flat bread.  Great spot in mississauga."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. The food is very good, price is fair, wine list is extensive, staff are excellent and the ambiance is very nice. It's hard to go wrong. I had the seafood linguine which was delicious with lots of fresh, well cooked seafood (shrimp, good sized scallops and lobster).  If your looking for a nice place to take a date it's a great choice. Thursday-Saturday are quite busy, so if your looking for a quieter night choose other nights."}
{"text":"This place is great for an easy night out. Although it can be loud, there's little pressure to get ready for a night on the town. Great place to grab a few cocktails, share some appetizers with friends and have great conversation. Not intended for a first date. Parking is overall good but can be an issue at times."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and location, prices are on the higher side with small portions, promo code on Yelp expired 10 months back and not removed or replaced."}
{"text":"I meet up for friends for dinner in the Port Credit area and we decide to check out Ten.  They have online reservations, which is a nice feature.

There were four of us.  My friend and I ended up getting the chicken dish (forget the name) with potatoes and salad.  It was average, the salad was tad bit heavily dressed, the potatoes were limited, the chicken was moist but the hit was the gravy.  I wish there were more potatoes for the gravy.

My other two friends got pasta dishes.  One had the spaghetti which was a descent portion but my other friend got the lobster dish which was an appetizer size.  

Each entree was about $20.  About average for the nicer restaurant in the area.  

They also had a live band playing after 9pm.

The part that was annoying that they dimmed the light half way through dinner for the more romantic feel but you could not see the person right across for you.

I recommend this place if you are the Port Credit area and are looking for a nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. Service was great and the staff went above and beyond to give us that personal touch. Food was great and oysters were fresh. Great service, food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Crazy busy at night. People actually go there to just hang out in the front patio. 

The food is good but nothing special.  I ordered the famous Pulled Pork sandwich and I did enjoy it but the wait time was terrible.  It took almost 45 minutes. 

The service was not bad. I find that the employees are a bit rude in their approach but maybe that's just me. 

All in all,  decent restaurant. I would return but it wouldn't be my first pick in Port Credit."}
{"text":"Allow me to offer a eulogy for Ten Restaurant, which closed last weekend and is now under new ownership, via a pair of buyers who plan to renovate the space and open another restaurant in the future.

The opening of Ten Restaurant ten years ago was a BIG DEAL. Whatever you may think of Door Fifty-Five now and the new \"trendy\" part of Port Credit, Ten was the trailblazer that set the pace for everything that followed. It was the place to go if you were young and wanted to fit in somewhere. Great menu items, very classy atmosphere, beautiful patio overlooking the Village Square, the works.

I have many fond memories of this place. I used to come here every so often for business meetings or hangouts with friends, but there were other instances that stick in my memory. Inadvertently walking into a private dinner for the Miss Canada contestants participating in the Port Credit Canada Day festivities and seeing them all say hello to me in unison. Listening to an older friend of mine relate a story about how he was accosted by two prostitutes in the middle of the day, begging for him to give them money. Having a female comedian use me as the punchline for jokes in the middle of a crowd of women. Fun times.

Yet Ten slipped over the years and eventually became a shell of its former self. Menu items tasted bland and unappealing. Service was lacking - I remember an instance where my friends and I waited for two hours last year just to get our bills because the servers had mysteriously disappeared.

You were the chosen one! It was your ball to drop, and you dropped it hard. I can't quite place my finger on any root cause, but the experience fell across the board. Weirdly, I wasn't nearly as broken up over the restaurant's closing as some others who attended the closing party last week were. Maybe that has to do with the fact that standards slipped so far that the place eventually became a shell of itself, The place just seemed cold and empty every time I passed.

I'm waxing poetic, but I think it's a good thing overall that they closed before things got much worse. I had known for a while that the owners were looking to shutter it, and I realized that it was high time for it to be put down.

Maybe the new owners will come back with a bigger and better restaurant. It's a prime piece of real estate, and that plaza deserves a five-star dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was horrible .... waitress never asked about how the food was.. seemed careless.. restaurant looked pretty but both the steak and potatoe gnucci were horrible....very disappointed to have picked this place for our one year anniversary. . Def not going back...  #upsetcustomer"}
{"text":"Expensive, not worth the money. However calamari was decent and tasty. 
Employees were rude and lack common sense. 
We had to ask to place an order for drinks, we had to ask for plates,  cutlery and napkins. Only to which took about twenty minutes to receive.
It was not busy at all however staff appeared anxious and overwhelmed. 
I over heard a couple complain as they were forgotten about!!  They waited an hour and  a half for no food or drinks. 
It was my first time here and will be my last."}
{"text":"This place is both a dinner place, and somewhere to go for dancing and mingling on the weekend. My review is a dinner review.

I came here last night (Wednesday). We started with a few drinks at the bar for their Wednesday Night Happy Hour. ($5.00 glass of wine and half price appetizers until 6:30pm). 

The appetizer we ordered was delicious, brie dip served with an assortment of vegetables, fruit, bread and waffles (complete with syrup). I would highly recommend the dish. It was perfect for sharing and a very generous portion. 

After an hour of sipping wine and munching on our appetizer we moved to the dining room for dinner. The booth we were put in was right by the window and felt very private with backs that went all the way to the ceiling. 

Between the two of us we ordered the Schnitzel and the Chicken Supreme and a couple glasses of wine. 

The Chicken Supreme was alright. It was a big pile of mashed potatoes, a couple tiny little pieces of zucchini and a piece of chicken stuff with stuffing the same colour and consistency as the chicken itself (odd!). The menu claimed there were leeks, and maybe there were in the stuffing but I couldn't find them. Overall I was hoping for more from this dish and it ended up just tasting SALTY.

The schnitzel was very greasy, in fact it tasted like it had been thrown in a deep fryer to cook. It was served with a lettuce and a dressing that was only mediocre and new potatoes that were a bit too dry. I've eaten better schnitzel at pubs.

I WOULD go back for half price appetizers and a glass of wine after work on a Wednesday. 3 stars for their happy hour. Especially in the summer on the patio.

However, for dinner, considering you're paying $20-$30 for an entree this place gets 2 stars and I wouldn't go back given the option. The quality is more in line with restaurants that charge $12-$15 an entree."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's go-to place for special occasions. We love the food, the service and the patio. Their burgers are my husband's favourite and I tend to try something different on their ever-changung menu each time.

We haven't been there in a little while so this might have changed but the last couple time we were there they didn't accept debit. We debit everything so this was a little annoying."}
{"text":"A quick update since there have been some big changes at TEN recently, namely to the decor and the menu. 

The decor has been upgraded with a refreshed looking bar - there even removed the talk whiskey display cabinet in exchange for a more open looking aesthetic. There is new flooring, and even some of the tables have been replaced by extremely comfortable and elegant 4-6 person booths. 

Decor is great but the menu changes were what really knocked my socks off. Many of the popular menu items are still there, but I was advised to try three of their new appetizers as shareable options. 

1. Lettuce wraps with Seoul. Four to a serving, 2-3 bite but packed with flavor and of course... Beef! Loved it

2. Deep fried shrimp dumplings. Pretty good in terms of flavor and i loved the dip they were served in, and very crisp on the outside. I was looking for a little more shrimp inside but I couldn't argue with the overall flavor and presentation. 

3. Chicken and Waffles. An appetizer? I would have had 2 servings of this as a meal. This is the new best thing in their menu (maybe better than the lobster rolls? Maybe).  

Great innovations. They've maintained their spot as one of my top spots in Mississauga. 

Eatcrest out 

Ps - great new beers in draft here as well including Brewdog!"}
{"text":"We had actually planned to go somewhere else but ended up here. The food was very good and the service was prompt and friendly. If I lived closer I could see eating here more often"}
{"text":"Awhile back, say last year I went here for my bro in laws birthday event. He booked the whole top floor and we ended up clearing the bar upstairs, we are a bunch of alkys! At that time, the set menu had simple pastas and soups/salads nothing to creative. I only remembered how much we were drinking not what we ate, which isn't too good for a nice restaurant like this. Now recently I came back for dinner, as soon as I walked in, the girls at the front seemed very cold. One of them was really quiet and it looked like she was uninterested to be there. She just asked for cover - no \"Hi\", no nothing. Manners are out the window... wonder how hard a simple smile is to pull off these days lol. Ten is a classy, adult environment, with not too much seating at the bar but the dining areas holds a number of people but I recommend having reservations. While we were waiting for our table I grabbed a nice long island. After 5 minutes we were seated and had such a friendly server. I ended up getting the crispy calamari and jerk shrimp to start and they were both delicious. For my main I got the butternut squash ravioli, it was warm & creamy. I thoroughly enjoyed my food and I think chef Nic Prong has really improved the menu from the last time I came. The only thing that needs to change are the people at the front, even the security guys were nice!"}
{"text":"Liquid dessert? HELL YEA!
Especially when it's only $5 martinis. And these were the very smooth, deliciously tasting, \"I could drink these all night\" type of martinis.

(I'm actually in need of a liquid meal right now! Too bad it's not $5 martini Thursdays today.)

On top of the hpnotiq cosmo (hpnotiq & white cranberry juice) and drunken peach (peach schnapps & champagne) martinis, we did order a real dessert - warm flourless chocolate cake with drunken raspberries and vanilla ice cream. And this dessert combo... it only made us want to scream for more... oh yes! MORE!

Everything that touched our lips that night at Ten was exactly what we were yearning for. Even though we were unaware that we were actually yearning for... 
something. 

The alcohol... the dessert... was perfectly paired off  for a catch up and unwind night with a very close friend. Thursday Ten nights, oh yea, we'll be back for you. We WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"So went here on a Saturday night for a birthday and I wasn't as impressed with the menu as it was a year or two ago the last time I went.

I got the salmon tartare which wasn't the greatest for me.  It would have been a bit better if the bread was toasted or had something crunchy with it as the texture of the salmon doesn't go well with soft bread.  My halibut was really dry and no real wow factor about my dish.  The mushrooms were basic, cooked in balsamic vinegar...the bread that came with that dish was heavenly though.  My friend got the seafood linguine which tasted amazing...wish I had that instead.  Crab cakes were good as well.

A friend got steak which was not cooked to her liking, they re-made the steak again and still too over-cooked.  They kindly compensated her steak dinner for her which was nice.

Atmosphere at Ten is nice with the modern touches and there was a DJ as well which was nice to have if you plan on staying the night to lounge around.

Overall, an okay experience for me.  I probably would go eat somewhere else and maybe come hang out for drinks/music after dinner."}
{"text":"Only went here for a couple of drinks, so this is only a commentary on the overall ambience of the place and service. Quite a nice bar for Mississauga with decent music. Patrons range from middle-aged couples to bachelorette party-goers. The bartenders were good, especially Ryan, who immediately asked for our names and introduced himself despite it being busy.  I liked the vibe until around 11pm when it turned into a club with extremely loud music and a dance floor. But hey, diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks, right?"}
{"text":"I have to shout out the manager who was really helpful, more on this later.

I have been here many times but last night was most recent.

Just came here for drinks last night. The cocktail list is short and fun, though it is a wine bar, if you want alternatives there are.

The food is decent here. Lobster rolls are tasty and the BBQ flat bread was also decent.

There was a strawberry cognac drink and a grey good pear martini, both were good. my date liked it. 

The only sucky thing here is there is no debit machine and the atms don't work, I had to jog to the gas station across the street to BUY A PRE PAID VISA CARD FOR $150. (soooo stupid), and come back, and evn then they had issues.

but the manager was cool, she saw the activation receipt and said she will take my name and number and call if there are issues and she would put through the payment the next day(it was Sunday night and whenever she tried to call in to ask why it wasn't working, the call centre was offline)

So all in all a good set of drinks and appz, but moreover really well designed space. Way better in the summer, but only for dinner and drinks.

I hear its a club at times, no thanks.lol. but seriously, go here to hang in port credit."}
{"text":"Ten.  I can only assume the name comes from the fact that they are pretty much right at the base of Hurontario AKA Highway 10 where it meets Lakeshore in Port Credit.

I didn't come here for dinner but rather a birthday party that was being held upstairs in the lounge area.  The upstairs also shared a long table in which another party was having dinner but pretty much all the upstairs bar belonged to us.

My friend was having her 30th birthday and when I asked her if I could get her a drink she said she covered the bar.  She had quite a few guests, maybe 30+ and she had taken care of all the drinks and finger foods.  The staff there I found were very nice, friendly and professional.  It felt like there was nothing we really needed at any point and whether or not we went to the bar to order drinks or if they came up to us to ask us if we wanted anything there was really no time I felt wanting.  

The food kept coming out as well and quite a variety of it.  Trays of chicken satay (with peanut sauce), samosas, spring rolls, sliders, and more just kept coming out and honestly it was often and there was always food to be had.  Glasses and trays were being taken away so fast there was always room for more in this ongoing cycle of clearing empty plates and bringing out of more full trays of food.  

While I didn't have to pay for anything that night as my friend took care of everything, I still found the service friendly and efficient.  I didn't have to ask for refills really and whomever was serving already knew what I was drinking so I didn't even have to tell them what I was having.  

It was a busy place and it seemed pretty lively.  Being on the second floor we could see the main floor bar and the main dining areas and the place was quite busy but the upstairs being a completely separate from the restaurant was well kept and the staff kept everybody quite pleased.

There wasn't a coat check or a place to hang our coats so just like a house party we used one of the seats and everybody just put their jackets there.  It was an enjoyable evening and the venue made sure everybody was well taken care of."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Friday night with a group of 10 people.  We reserved a table upstairs and because of this we were told each person had to order a minimum of $20.00 per person.  Most of the entree's are priced from $14.00 and upwards.  I had the roast chicken but substituted the polenta for mashed potatoes.  The portion was reasonable and very filling.  The chicken had a BBQ sauce coating that tasted like Diana's BBQ sauce.  The cosmopolitan I ordered was uninspired and probably the worse one I've had--it was way too frothy and wasn't prepared properly. Other people in our party enjoyed their meals.  After 10 the DJ starts and the place gets extremely loud.  The dance floor is small but if you can snag one of the tables across from it--its a nice place to hang out and groove to the music."}
{"text":"I have driven and walked by this place multiple times and have always wanted to try it. Finally today, with all the Canada Day crowds out and about, we made an executive decision to sit down on the patio and watch the festivities and have a beverage. 

Unfortunately I cannot comment on the food but we ordered a couple of the wine cocktails - Pinot & Peach and Riesling & Strawberry. Reading the descriptions they sounded perfectly refreshing for the hot day but I underestimated how incredible these drinks would taste. I'd return here for these exact same beverages over and over -- and possibly try the food next time as well."}
{"text":"There are better restaurants in Port Credit.  I've dined here half a dozen times and it's ok at best.  It's tasty but nothing special.  I once found a piece of metal netting in my burger.  The waiter handled the situation appropriately.  Summer time mojito pitchers are pretty good.  Oh and when they advised that our pasta dish was served al dente (which is the way it should be) we didn't realize that meant uncooked and clumped together."}
{"text":"Ten is an interesting place. A bit of a cougar hang out but it's pretty fun for a small group outing. I've found the food there to be consistently decent the few times I've eaten there. Sweet potato fries is always the right answer.

The clubbing scene is alright for Mississauga. They have a small dance floor. Music is generally top 40 but every now and then the DJ will spin random Spanish/Cuban flavoured music, but not the good kind... He also has a tough time with certain song transitions...

All in all, a last minute, let's get dressed up to go out, Ten is a fun place to check out. They do charge cover after 10 except Fridays, ladies are free :)

And don't be shy if you come to Ten to dance. Lots of people will be checking you out. Fact of life."}
{"text":"Had a late night with the girls celebrating my bestie's birthday.

I was excited to try out Ten since it had such a high yelp rating and it always looked inviting every time I drove passed it.
When we got inside I decided to \"check in\" w/ Yelp and a coupon for 15% off popped up. I asked the hostess what it was about and she said I should ask my server.

After we were seated, I asked him and he said he'd let me know.
The menu wasn't very extensive but it did contain some staples. The drinks are on the pricier scale than many places I've been but we were there for a good time and it was a special occasion so i wasn't too bothered by it.
After we ordered our drinks....
the shots were great. ($6ea)
The martini's were VERY sweet. (At $13 ea.)

The Nachos were literally 75% jalapeños....and in a nacho bowl that got soggy very quickly. We regretted ordering them. Pricy and we left most of them.
The sweet potato fries were amazing, and the veggie spring rolls were very good too. Loved the peanut sauce!

The manager/owner (no clue who he was) came by our table and explained the coupon issue. Said they had that deal from way before and he forgot to take it down. But that he would honor it.
The final bill came to $100+ and the discount was 7% not 15% but It might have been one of those deals that doesn't include drinks... a small discount is still better than no discount.

I must say that the food presentation was amazing, and our server went above and beyond...he brought out a special birthday treat!! Raspberry sorbet/ chocolate tartufo (italian ice cream). It even had a sparkler! What more could a birthday girl ask for?
I couldn't pass up dessert and ordered myself a creme brûlée. (10/10)
And my sis had the churro....Not bad.

Overall, I had a great night but mainly because my girls are a blast to be around. I might contemplate going back because the service was really great and the atmosphere is upscale."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Came here for a Saturday lunch. The place was empty except for 2 people sitting at the bar and a table on the patio. After 10 minutes our server showed up with a glass of water. We ordered a glass of wine and lunch. Then we waited, and waited.....nothing. The place was empty so not sure why we were being ignored but now we know why the place was deserted. With all the great choices now in Port Credit there is no need for a foolish server who doesn't want to serve. We left.... Ridiculous."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night around 11 I came with a group of other women for the music and to dance. The DJ was good but played way too much 90s dance. The bartenders were quick and friendly and the drinks were good. The place is nice but the crowd is very young. I don't think I'd come for the food because there are so many bad food reviews but if you're 21-25 I'd say this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Cold food. We lost our waitress and no one cleaned our table after the means.  Would come back if drinking only. Maybe."}
{"text":"Soooo the first appetizer came out 45 minutes after we placed our order.  The second another 10 minutes later.  5 more minutes pass and the kitchen send out 3 orders of complimentary spring rolls as an apology for waiting so long and we are assured our entrées will be right out.  Although it was a Sunday and the place was nearly empty, the group of 20 that was there overwhelmed the kitchen.

One app didn't even make it to our table. 

My steak which was ordered medium rare came out medium well and was maybe 3oz on a good day.  Oh, it was cold as well.  No one else was over impressed with their meals and the overwhelming consensus was it was mediocre at best.  

Keep in mind our point of view might be skewed as we did take over 2.5 hours to get through our meals and another 30 minutes to get the bill.   We also didn't order any drinks or coffee, so we aren't sure what the hold up was.     We won't be back.

I also forgot to mention a note on the menu that allowed you to pay and extra $10 on your bill to send a round of drinks to the kitchen.  Tres tacky."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.

Too bad  I missed the elite event here in February, but the awesome chef pulled out the stops again for the Missisauga Dish Crawl which I awesomely got to be a part off.

This was the first stop in the night, and boy, what a location! Beautiful interior, with an AWESOME second floor that looks over the whole restaurant. So grande.

The chef was really nice, and really into his food. He did a small intro before releasing the kraken :)

We had:

1. Chicken N Waffles with a watermelon salsa - Save for the slightly syrupy salsa, which isn't my cup of tea, it was sooo good. Crispy, chickeny, yummy.

2. TRUFF THAT MAC N CHEESE BOY. Yea, truffled mac n cheese. SO. GOOD. OMG. I wanted to eat 4. I was advised to eat 4. Silly lactose intolerance. I hate you. I LOVE YOU MAC.

3. LOBSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH ROLLS. They were delicious. It was actually my first lobster roll. I'm just going to leave it there. It was delicious. My hands were covered in butter after. Delicious.

4. Vegan?!?!? Spring Rolls. Totally thought it was chicken until he announced they were vegan. I should remove a star for devil magic, but then I should also add two stars for amazing trickery.

5. The special cocktail they made for us. I didn't catch the name. It was light and delicious. A perfect way for me to end my month long sobriety. It was the first  drink I had after. 

Final notes:

This restuarant actually gives me a good reason to come to Port Credit. Maybe Kris is actually on to something here."}
{"text":"I seem to be the only person interested in the food here, and now I know why. Came here for a birthday party with a large group. The calimari was doughy, the salmon tartare was boring and the various burgers seems meh at best. I know there was a much more interesting menu last year.

The staff was kind and quickish, but I get the impression that they're overworked.

And then there's the night club aspect. It makes no sense at all. Either you're a resto or a club. Impossible to do both well in such an open space.

I don't think I'd come again. Much better food mere steps away."}
{"text":"Very nice spot.  Food was great, been there 3 times.  Atmosphere is just as good. It's in a new part of Port Credit so not a lot right around it, but hey, you're just in Port Credit....go downtown if you want to wander!"}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about Ten is the venue. It's a very spacious, classy atmosphere. I like that they have a DJ and dance floor because not many restaurants have that. However, the service is ridiculously slow. I had threw a party here recently, and it's understandable that it would take a little longer than usual because of the large amount of people, but knowing for months that a huge dinner party was going to be taken place here I expected them to be a little more prepared. I was truly embarrassed about how slow everything was. We had to use a set menu and we were all seated at around 8:45. We got our APPETIZERS an HOUR later, our main course about another 45 mins later and we didn't get our dessert until around 11:15. It was horrible and I felt terrible for my guests who had to pay 34 + tax for such horrible service. 

The food was good but in very small portions. Overall, It would have been nice if the food wasn't so slow, that was a total buzz kill. 

I would not recommend coming here if you have a large group, if you do, i suggest bringing suitcase full of board games and cards because it will be a hell of a long wait."}
{"text":"The TEN isn't even worth a FIVE.  Save your money people.  Bleech.  To me it is really a bar/nightclub definitely not what I'd call a great dining establishment.  The only upside to this place is obviously the outdoor patio but hey, they can really only utilize this one good thing a few months of the year.  I found the cavernous upper level to feel like an echo chamber.  I ordered a Cosmo and was disappointed to taste a cocktail that obviously came from that cosmo in a bottle mixture that Smirnoff has concocted.  I ordered a Pickeral main that sounded delish....a filet of whitefish atop an apple jicama slaw and topped with aioli.  What I got was a piece of overcooked, fish laying on a couple of slabs of sliced green apple with some really crappy coleslaw.  Someone needs to teach the guys in the kitchen the difference between aioli and sour cream because they plunked a blob of sour cream on top of the fish.  My partners meal didn't fair much better.  He ordered a Schnitzel and it was just a pounded out piece of a rubbery pork chop.  This, plus a couple of drinks cost us $100 bucks and a couple of hours that we'll never get back.  I know there is food life in suburbia but it sure is hell ain't at TEN."}
{"text":"We went to Ten on our first date and returned on Friday for our three year anniversary- it has changed and not for the better
I ordered a seductive chocolate martini (which according to the menu had red wine in it) it came as clear as water - not what I ordered
We ordered a salad and a charcuterie board and an 8oz glass of red wine

A 5oz glass of wine arrived and when he food arrived 45 minutes later, it arrives it had a multitude of meats and such, but three small pieces of crustini - am I supposed to spread hummus on my fingers?

When I asked for more bread they bring me 7 more small pieces and then charged me $3 for it

The first time we were there it was a wonderful experience, but I can tell you I will never go back"}
{"text":"Terrible... Service was poor. Water glass was never refilled.  Had to ask for drinks. Two of us ordered steaks. Both cooked wrong. I asked for medium rare and received medium well. Sent it back... Rest of table finished eating before my second steak showed up very rare, all most blue. Manager apologized and said he would look after us and never did anything. Full bill. Waitress hovered over me while I paid with credit card. Will never go again. There are much better restaurants in the Port Credit area for equal or lesser cost"}
{"text":"We went for a corporate event of 40 peope and it was a disgrace, worse Christmas party we have ever had, this place really deserves 0 stars 

0 stars because:

1. 40 people were not seated together but at separate tables and we were not allowed to order from the menu there were only 4 entree options on the selective menu we were given 

2. Drinks took 20 minutes, dinner took 1 hour and 15 minutes and for no reason dessert took 45 minutes and this after the place was empty only 2 other tables were seated

3.Ordered a drink the waitress recommend called a new york whisky sour, it was maybe .5 shot of whisky and a half a cup of red wine? Who the he'll puts red wine in a whisky sour? F'n disgusting 

4. I ordered my steak medium and it came out more than well done and after waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for it the steak was cold like it had been sitting out for at least half hour and was served on top of my mashed potatoes, why serve it like that? Besides stupidity

5. There was no choice for dessert we were given cold pudding in a espresso glass

Total entree and dessert was $44 spent on the coldest meal I ever had plus a mandatory $8 tip per person for each person (this is after our hr department was told there would be no mandatory tip and when they went to clarify this management brushed them off and said there is always a mandatory tip), and lastly $11 for my whisky sour covered in cheap red wine

In the end us 40 people that all work together and their families will never go back to this stupid restaurant again, along with the other 5000 people we work with and their families have all received the \"comments\" in a email blast"}
{"text":"They just did a renovation that made their already great venue even better! There is a small stage area for their events and a second level for private events. I love their food and their service was spectacular. Our waitress was able to remember all the items we asked for including one when I stopped her to get something for us. 

We will definitely come again. You would need to pay for parking on the street."}
{"text":"Ten always has great food and great wine..

Tried a few different tastes because we were on a DishCrawl.. 
spring rolls were good - just spring rolls though.. nothing special.. not sure what else you could do with spring rolls so that's not a bad thing..
chicken waffles were good but kinda fell apart, and the sauce they were in was too sweet for my taste.
lobster in a bun looked good but was actually kinda bland.. 
macaroni with seafood was sooo amazing and I had two servings.

Half-price wine on Monday.. I should add that in as a tip.. 

If you go on a Thursday you may have some cougar sightings.. I guess that could also be a Yelp tip for those who are into that kinda thing.."}
{"text":"Sometimes places try to be upscale by putting expensive things on the menu...
Ten kinda gave me that feeling; the food and drinks are on the higher end of the price scale and unfortunately I wasn't exactly impressed.  Three of us shared 3 appetizers, 1 pitcher of sangria and a dessert, and it came to $41 each including tax and tip. The pink sangria was very good, but had a bit too much ice. The calamari ($9.98) was ok, but the lobster poutine ($14.98) was pretty disappointing. It was overdone and one bite actually tasted moldy. It was just some not very good poutine with lobster bits on top. That is one dish you can skip. The Mushroom & Artichoke Flatbread ($11.98) was pretty good. The chocolate ganache dessert, I have to say though, was delicious. On the up side there is free street parking nearby and their website reads \"Our animals are treated well in life and prepared with passion on the plate. We only use seasonal produce and support local when available.\"  I sincerely hope that's true. The place is pretty big so you are likely to be seated, like we were, even if you walk in on a Saturday night at 8:30pm.  Later in the evening they start playing dance music, so it is convenient if you want to have an all-in-one outting at one place. The only thing is the dance floor is tiny and once the music starts you can no longer have a conversation. The music wasn't bad but could do with more current songs. They have a patio that faces a small grassy area between the buildings, but the only people that went out there were the smokers, and smoke wafted in every time the door opened. Overall it is a nice venue, I think I might go back and give it another chance since the service was professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Sexpensive! And I don't understand why people line up to hang at Ten on Saturday nights. I'd just go to Downtown. Regardless, I've had some of the best martinis at Ten. It used to be half-price on Fridays. Not sure if they still do that.

The food's good too. Don't expect generous portions though. I don't know if I would call this a fine dining but it's close. The ambience is dark, sexy and the seating is nice. And I'm not smoking anything, but I swear I feel this \"groove\" every time I am there. 

Tip: Dress in black... Don't know why, it just fits!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I went to Ten a few months ago after I bid on a tasting menu dinner that they donated for charity on a blog that I follow. I had heard nothing but good things from some of their regulars (who are also awesome food bloggers who's reviews I trust) so I was excited to check the place out.

The meal my girlfriend and I experienced was by far one of the best dining experiences I have ever had living in Toronto. Course after course, each dish was not only cooked perfectly, it also tasted amazing too!

The meal included an incredible charcuterie board, house made zucchini loaf which tasted like banana bread, gigantic arincini, arttic char, crab bisque, duck & noodles, pork tenderloin and an artisan chese board!

We left more than stuffed and the last item on the tasting menu was some house made chocolate truffles to take home.

I can't speak too much about their regular menu, but I believe you can order this menu if you plan it in advance with the chef.

The staff were all extremely kind as well and checked in with us constantly throughout the night.

We also tried a couple of their cocktails to start and both were gigantic and great value compared to what you get downtown Toronto.

I look forward to returning to Ten soon to try some other items from their regular menu to see if it is as good as the stuff on this special menu."}
{"text":"Still Underwhelming

I last visited Ten about 5 years ago (or longer) and at that time, you would have thought you were going to One in Yorkville, with a selective hostess, a fatal attempt at a tony club feel and food served by wait staff with an \"edge\". And at that time you wouldn't dare ask for a table other than what you were shown to...unless you were a regular. Having heard that the restaurant/bar underwent a renovation, I decided to try it out for drinks.

The bar area tries to take on a \"Cheers\" feel where everyone knows your name. The bartender reaches over uninvited with an out stretched hand to introduce himself. I think his name was \"G\", but who knows. His hand was large and rough skinned and I'm not sure, were it not implied to be impolite, my guest would have touched it. I think this was a lame attempt to instantly become your friend and get you to stay longer. The bartender at the King Edward Hotel or at the Four Seasons doesn't reach out to shake my hand and neither should \"G\". Let your guests warm up to you, if they choose to.

The interior seems to be the same 'dark' design so I am not sure what the renovation involved so there may have been nicer areas. At 5pm, various important looking staff are circling the premises and preparing for old time local friends to come in and give them a hug when they arrive. I think this is great for the regular clientele but it makes new patrons feel like they're outsiders, at least we did."}
{"text":"Rushed service. 
Food wasn't any different. Nothing special. 
Had sangria and appetizers and decided not to stick around for dinner."}
{"text":"this was definitely a great experience. I can't really talk about the wines, but i know my coworkers loved them. As for the food, i was really really happy. We shared an appetizer mix, which was pretty cool, mostly the melted cheese, i almost licked the plate. I had lamb, and that was great and for dessert, the creme brulee. They have 4 different perfumes in small little ramequins, that was amazing. Just do it. I gave the coffee flavored one away, as i am not a fan, but ate the 3 other ones, delicious. Almond, chocolate and vanilla. MIAM"}
{"text":"I took a look at the wine list and pricing provided on their website and I was absolutely shocked.

Being from California and spending the last 10 year in and around wine country I have become very familiar with many wineries and their labels.  

I am floored as to how much they are charging for some of the wines.  I know for a fact that many of the bottles listed are no more than $14....."}
{"text":"Certainly for my meal Ten was a One.

What are the chances that 3 years after my first visit we'd be seated in the same exact table (not a terribly good one by the kitchen door) and have it turn out to be, as the meal progressed, a sunset nightmare. The two seated opposite me could not even open their eyes wide enough to see me by the time our mains was finished.

The starter was an outwardly homemade soup that was completely devoid of taste?

A ravioli style dish with a slapped together Bolognese sauce that tasted \"different\"? I'm not sure if they forgot to cook the pasta itself or if this was the chef's choice (a very bad one).

The people who joined me enjoyed their meals marginally more and thus two starts but that does make me a little uncomfortable to bestow.

This is a physically tired spot that I understand the owners wanted to sell only a year or two after opening. Perhaps they should have."}
{"text":"I love Ten.  Not because of the food or the drinks, but because the staff is friendly and you become almost a \"local\" when you visit a few times, people know you by name ;).  they also have great specials like half price wine, and 4 dollar coronas.  It's also pretty.... so great for dates!

Go in the summer when the patio is open and you can sit and sip a dirty martini :p"}
{"text":"I went here last night for my birthday with a big group of friends - there were about 16 of us.  I'd made a reservation for 9:30, and then found out that they start charging cover at that time.  I told my friends to get there a bit earlier to avoid the charge.  Our table wasn't ready until almost 10, so the big group of us was awkwardly squeezed in by the bar waiting.
We waited a long time for everything.  Our drinks took a long time to get to us, and our food took a VERY long time; we waited 45 minutes to an hour for our food.  I ordered small plates of the pulled pork on butter rolls, and the fish tacos.  The pulled pork was delicious, even the bread was really good.  The fish tacos were good too, but seemed skimpy on the amount of fish.  My friend raved about the oysters.  I can only assume that the waitstaff just didn't really care about serving us because they had already tacked on an 18% gratuity charge to our bills.  They also had something on the bill about an option to add $10 to your bill to buy a round for the kitchen - are they for real??  The food is pricey enough as it is.
I wanted to dance, so we settled up our tabs and headed to the main bar by the \"dance floor\" (it's so small!).  A bunch of my friends left at that point either because they weren't into the dancing, or they just found it too crowded.  There weren't very many people dancing, and we soon found out why - they don't let you take your drink onto the dance floor!!  I've never seen this anywhere.  I guess they don't want people spilling their drinks on it, but the space is so small that it's not like it would even take long to clean up.  The DJ was ok, but he was on the upper level playing to the crowd downstairs.  We wanted to make requests, but nobody wanted to have to go all the way upstairs to ask for a song.  My one friend did request a song, and he never played it.
This bar didn't do anything to enhance my night, it was made fun only because I was with good company.  We would have been much better off at a pub; I'll remember this for next year."}
{"text":"I love this port credit stip that the restaurant is situated on.  In the summer, I would recommend eating here and walking around the area.  

The service was good, and the decor was elegant.  The food quality is also top notch.  My only reason for not giving a 5 star is that the pricing is a bit expensive.  

Also, I have heard some bad things about this place, such as doorman not allowing a large bachelorette party to sit inside due to lack of space (fair enough), and on the flipside my buddies were there last saturday and said the place was dead.  

But my review is based on the restaurant during dining hours.

{"text":"It's been two years since I last wrote a review for Ten. It's amazing how much can change in two years. This past summer, I got to met the awesome chef of the restaurant, Nic Prong. My friends and I were treated to a tasting menu to preview the new menu. 

I can tell you that the menu has changed drastically. It is no longer a menu like cookie cutter franchise restaurants. The new menu has items that change daily (the tacos sell out by 7 pm) and you can tell a lot of thought has been put into each dish. Some noteworthy items: Parmesan Dusted Fries with black garlic mayo (to die for), Bay of Fundy Lobster Roll, Little Brothers Beet Salad and Buccatini Simple. There is so much more on the menu I would like to try so I will be back again and again.

What I really like is the fact that the managers take the time to greet guests at each table and see how their meal is. If you are lucky, hopefully you'll get a chance to meet Chef Nic. I am telling you, he is the nicest chef ever with a big heart!

While the weather is still nice, go to Ten, sit on the patio and make sure to order a pitcher of their delicious sangria. The food is absolute fabulous and the staff is wonderful. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was there last night with a party of 11. The service staff was great. But the negatives are that the food service was very slow. Took a really long time to get appetizers and our entrées. There were no bread baskets. The entree portions are very small. About 5 of us ordered the Artic Char, it's $25.00 and the portion is appetizer size. The menu says it's served with fingerling potatoes but what you get are about 3 thin shaved potato chips. Honestly this dish was the joke and disappointment of the night. We were all starving when we left. And our entrees were cold too. We did complain and the staff offered to send some appetizers to our table. But we did not want to wait another 40 minutes for those. So they adjusted our bill slightly as restitution.
We won't be back. If you go make sure you eat before or you'll be going out for pizza afterwards."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE this Place... A favourite on my List!!! Very Classy, you won't find all 20 year Olds there. Great DJ, A bit on the Pricey side though!!!"}
{"text":"Years have gone by and I've driven past this restaurant without stepping foot inside. I finally did this week for lunch. The food is mediocre - I had the fish and chips and it was pretty pricey  for what I got ($16 for one piece of fish, a handful of fries and some weirdly thick slaw). It tasted fine, nothing too exciting. Service was great, though. Server was super friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is nice, bright, I can see it getting pretty lit in the evening. I won't be back any time soon but at least I got to experience the heated paper towels in the restroom (seriously they're warm)."}
{"text":"Since I live fairly close to this place- it partly influences why I enjoy dining / coming here.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is great for drinks and food with a small group and even a better location for a large group. The upstairs is usually reserved for group functions with a private bar, an intimate setting and comfortable seating (regular chairs, a padded booth and couches)

Service: I have never had an issue with service the times that I have gone. Some waiters are more knowledgeable than others but that goes with many restaurants. 

Food: I have had multiple items off the older menu but with their recent menu here is what I have to say.

St. Williams Cheeseburger - DELICIOUS!! It is a great burger with excellent toppings that work very well together. (not your typical burger- but extremely well executed and tasty) I also enjoyed the fries (now that they taste a lot better, before they seemed under cooked). Now they are lightly seasoned and more. The presentation was overall fantastic on the wooden chop board and tin for the fries. Loved it.

Mushroom + Artichoke Flatbread - also delicious, perfect portion size for an app and sharing

 Lobster Roll- a little too messy and overwhelming. This made the roll taste somewhat soggy but the filling was enjoyable. They should listen to the term \"less is more\" because it would really help avoid messy eating as people are looking to dance the night away not look like a hot mayo mess afterwards.

Music/Dance: the dance floor is seriously tiny- they should consider expanding it but I see why it is so small as they want to avoid a club like atmosphere and stick to an intimate lounge spot. The DJ sometimes is a hit or miss but is usually very fond of requests. He listens and delivers and once he notices what the crowd enjoys- he keeps going.

Overall, because it is local and I love the burger and the music can be great- I have no issues coming here at all. Great choice for  a girls night or a birthday outing."}
{"text":"Came here for appetizer on labour day....place was not very busy, only a few tables. Ordered nachos with beef which were just good. Needed more beef. 
Server no where to be found. 
My 1 stars tho is that when the nachos came out the server said to be careful as the plate was a little bit warm.  A little warm my ass! It was frickin scalding hot! I went to move the plate a bit towards the middle of the table and burned my thumb!!!  A little warm is a mug of tea! 
I let the manager???know after he came to see what we needed as our server was MIA.  He thanked me for letting him know. The servr should have better informed me. 
No one offered me anything. No tip for you."}
{"text":"Recently my girlfriend and I went to Ten Restaurant as we always have had great food here.  They have live music during the week, including a \"jazz\" band on Wednesdays.  The day that we most recently went we both tried the Winterlicious menu.  I had a Striploin, but did not enjoy how hard the outside layer of the steak was.  My girlfriend had a Chicken entre and it was a lot better and infused with many more flavours than the steak, which was placed on a bed of what appeared like a spicy chilli.  Overall I think I expected more out of the Winterlicious menu.

Any other day we have been here it has been awesome, with great menu choices including an Ostrich Steak...

For the ladies, this place has great martinis and for the wine enthusiast, there is a great selection of wines.  The wine cellar in the middle of the restaurant is a nice highlight to the place.  The dance floor is big enough to dance in, if you're into that.  I have never sat closer to the bar area, but it always seems to be quite busy. 

The sangria was good...good, but not quite as good as we have had in Spain or how we have learned to make it.  

Overall a great place to go for dinner and some live music down by the Port Credit area.  The walk around the Port Credit strip is also a great one to do after dinner on a nice summer day."}
{"text":"I've been here many a times for their night life, which is fun but nothing too exciting. Today we decided to come for a late afternoon/early evening glass of wine and some appies... And I must say I far prefer them in their wine bar identity. Their house red was the Santa Carolina Cab-Merlot blend and a totally steal at $1/1oz. We also got the lobster poutine and two pulled pork sliders. The lobster poutine was yummy and well priced at $15 but the flavour of lobster meat was a bit drowned out by the gravy (maybe could have used some more cheese curds too). The sliders were delicious, and we actually got a second helping of them! I love that you can order them individually at $4 each.

Service was friendly and pretty fast (though I think we may have been the only ones there); overall a good experience. I was a tad weary that a \"club\" wouldn't have the best food but I was pleasantly surprised and will be back again (maybe for jazz night!!)"}
