{"text":"This is an amazing atmosphere. Wonderful service and perfectly portioned food.  This place is a great stop for breakfast or brunch; come back for happy hour and enjoy their specials."}
{"text":"Picked this place as it was within walking distance to Drury Hotel.  Friendly staff excellent food.  Had grilled chicken, humus and broccoli and everything was absolute perfection.  Would definitely go back next time in town."}
{"text":"Great atmophere, food and staff. They have weekly entertainment and unique menu choices. The Manager Ryan always gives a welcome and warm greeting. The patio area is  great for comfortable lounging. It is my favorite place."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to start on this review. But here it goes! Let's start with the decor and vibe.  I would say that there  is nothing like this place in Chandler, but that would be a huge disservice. I don't know if I have been to a place like this anywhere.  Bright and airy during the day(morning is the only day time I have been there so far), and really cool lounge vibe at night.  The chandelier is breathtaking and mesmerizing at the same time.  I asked if they could just lock me in the all glass wine room and let me drink my way out. My wife and the guy seating us didn't allow that to happen.  We sat at the couches again one of the windows and then moved to the bar for dinner. When the weather gets better I will definitely go out to the lounges on the patio. I guess I can go on to the drinks, we had a couple before dinner. My wife had an orange martini off their drink list, but neither of us can remember the name. She was impressed and it was noticeable because she was ready for another before I finished my old fashioned. Our drinks came out quick and were made well. After a couple of drinks on the couches we moved on to the bar for some food and some wine.   A small annoyance that I don't like at restaurants is that they can't/won't allow you to physically move seats without closing out. Not a problem here, and no grumbles from our waitress. We were greeted quickly by a very small girl bartender. I don't know how she reached everything but she did!   So next shocker, they have their house wines on tap!  I think they were Arizona wines from Stronghold. The old fashioned may have mixed that up for me.  Anyway, we both got a white wine, which was very good. We didn't have to ask for a menu because we were offered one after our wine was set down. We started with a crab artichoke dip that was like tasting heaven.  Two of my favorite things that I didn't think that could ever meet!  The mini pita breads with I think olive oil drizzle made it even better.  Highly recommend this appetizer.  They need to give more pitas though, mostly because of the amount of dip they give you. That didn't stop my wife from going at it with a fork and finishing it off.   For our main entrees I ordered the chicken with hummus purée and my wife ordered the salmon with sautéed spinach.  The food came out in under 15 minutes, if it were a little faster, I may have not have had to buy a bottle of wine from the fancy glass case. But they did carry Rombauer, so I think the bottle was happening either way. Back to the food.  My chicken was excellent, cooked perfectly with a crisp outside and juicy inside. I would have never thought hummus but it paired perfectly.  The portion was great. That is going to be my go to, I can already tell. My wife is a salmon snob, you give her dry or bad salmon and she will never forgive you, uh, I mean them. She loved hers and it was cooked just the way she likes it. I don't know if she said she liked the spinach because she was too busy with the salmon comments but the plate was clear. I don't know how she did it but managed to order the bananas foster bread pudding.  I did sneak a bite and it was outstanding. That alone could make me a dessert person. I guess I am all over the place, but I will go back to the vibe.  The music is good, kind of a medium energy lounge music.  They turned up the music and it was a bit loud and then I saw another cool feature of this Chandler gem.  The glass walls all slide open.  Then I saw the really modern fire pits light up.  This place just turned into a luxury lounge out Los Angles or Vegas.  Mind Blown!  It wasn't until my wife came back from the restroom that she said these people thought of everything!! She said if they had couches and a bar in the women's room she would have stayed there. (Thanks babe, love you too). From her report, they had full length doors, purse hooks, back lit mirrors and fresh flower arrangements. I guess all things that impress women. The men's had a urinal and I was quite content without purse hooks in there. So we were winding up our night and because we had long since decided on uber, we decided to test the small bartenders espresso martini.  She delivered with a smile. Oh the crowd is a good mix of professionals in the 30-50 age range, not too rowdy but fun. So the next morning as we had our coffee by the pool, trying to shake the cobwebs out, we decided that breakfast is an order. Now due to lack of options we will either make breakfast or suffer through a BLD breakfast, but alas we have another option!!! We made our way to Meridiem around 10am, after having to search for an empty parking spot we walked in.  We were greeted by what we later found out was the owner Ryan. He asked how we were feeling with a wink and asked if we wanted something lively or a little quieter(I must have looked a little hungover). But my momma dint raise a quitter so we were seated at the last open table (this place is packed and I don't think it w"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Decided to sit outside. Got the menu and decided what I wanted to order.. waiting.. waiting .. and the waitress isn't even coming!! 20 minutes!! Rude! Had to call the restaurant and tell them to send a waitress outside, that they forget about one of their customers. After my meal was served NOBODY came to check on me to see if i was doing good.. literally it took my waitress 25 min to come back! The food is good and I've heard so much recommendations about this place but after being treated like my money isn't so worthy good service never coming back!! Felt like a piece of crap!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice but unfortunately that isn't enough. $11 for a caprese salad. Terrible tomatoes and paper thin. Maybe they were salvaging. Silly.  Skinny wrap... eh, husband has nothing to say about it. It did not look like the Yelp picture I saw. Looked more like chopped up  Matzo Brei.   Not much to choose from on brunch menu.   I think this is like The Living Room. A fancy bar for adults who want a snack and not fried bar food.   Maybe breakfast is good?  Pictures look nice. Guess I will only ever just see pictures. Better places to go.  Cool light over the bar....."}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim, yesterday (6/13/17) for lunch, and glad we did. We were greeted warmly at the door and it got better from there. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious, and the ambiance was very nice. The one complaint was the place was a bit noisy, because there was nothing to dampen the sound. The owner assured us that they were aware of the situation and were working on remedying it. We tried the steak hoagie, the portobello caprese, the chicken breast entree, and the Meridiem burger. Everything was scrumptious, especially the sauteed spinach (we had seconds). We had such a positive experience, we're going to make this one of our go-to places."}
{"text":"I stopped by for happy Friday night.  The place was very busy.  I enjoyed a nice happy hour wine and for $4.00 a glass, that was a nice surprise.  I had the salmon, grilled asparagus and sautéed spinach which was all excellent.  The decor is lovely, but unfortunately the concrete floors, wood, glass and other hard surfaces, although they look beautiful, lends itself to a very loud environment.  So loud, in fact, that my friend and I ate dinner and left rather than ordered another glass of wine. I look forward to going back and trying breakfast and happy hours again when the weather is nice enough to sit on the patio so I can enjoy a conversation with my meal.  I'd love to try other options on the menu as I really did enjoy my dinner and wine."}
{"text":"The music is too loud for a comfortable conversation but everything else was great. So tell the musician to turn the volume down by 2 numbers on her amps and it would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our food was brought out 15 minutes apart after waiting for 30 minutes. We asked what was going on and kept getting different excuses. To make it worse the manager didn't care at all. Won't be going back. Go to BLD instead. Better menu and way better service and food."}
{"text":"Met some friends at Meridiem last night. It was very packed when we arrived and we were told it could be a long wait. We didn't mind and made our way to the bar. However within 10 minutes our hostess, Ivy approached and said our table was ready. While Ivy's role was technically over after she seated us, Ivy went above and beyond to ensure our experience was everything. Unfortunately due to the chaos of a Friday night on a holiday weekend, after our server introduced herself - we almost never saw her after that. She seemed to have little control over her many tables. While we all attempted to get her attention and or flag her down, she kept rushing past us and was fairly rude about her level of busy. Thankfully, Ivy never took her eye off our table. She was the one who took our order, made sure everything came out as ordered, and never left us with empty drinks for long. And it wasn't just us - Ivy made it look flawless to continue seating people while always checking in on tables, refreshing drinks where necessary and making sure everyone in the restaurant was happy and content. I would typically be furious with a waitress who was so absent and careless but thanks to Ivy, we never wanted for anything.  I won't hesitate to return to Meridiem thanks to the treatment and service Ivy provided!"}
{"text":"A Five Star experience at 4 star prices.  This was a really cool place to meet and hang out. The food was more appropriately priced than the wine.  I expect a healthy mark up on drinks and I do understand the need, however 9 dollars for a glass of 6.99 / bottle of wine, come on."}
{"text":"Really like the place but it is very loud, even when not too busy.  Too many hard surfaces and no sound dampening."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Love the bright atmosphere, tall windows & high ceilings. Food is very good, quick service. Sunday morning a bit nicer with some good music in the background.  Plan to come back for dinner & happy hour."}
{"text":"Nice and clean, terrible service.  I don't know if our server was the only one working the restaurant.  It seemed like it.  It took a long time to get the order taken and then brought out.  The food was room temperature.  Drinks were never refilled or offered to be refilled.  Hard to finish a meal when you don't have a drink.  Had to ask to get silverware.  The crunchy french toast was so crunchy that it hurt to bite into it and there was no flavor.  The turkey sausage was cold and tough like it had been reheated over and over.   Apple pancakes were good and very generous serving size, but cold. Even the cinnamon butter didn't melt on them.  Biscuits with gravy and eggs were good, but again room temperature.  The tables next to us were also upset with the service and made several comments.  One customer had to wave both hands in the air to get the attention of the server.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is the hotspot in south chandler! Great food, excellent service and top notch drinks"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time for brunch and were blown away by how good the food was.  Bloody Mary's were extremely reasonable and the food was delicious.  We had the Meridiem Sunrise and the Chilaquiles and were highly impressed with both.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new Chandler restaurant. We wanted breakfast on a Sunday morning and we are always in the market for a breakfast place that serves alcohol. I loved the outside of the restaurant and the ambience was very classy. We sat at the bar , ordered a drink and sat and waited ..... and waited ..... and waited for someone to take our order. Finally our orders were taken ..... the American skillet with poached eggs and the grilled cheese/ tomato soup combo with waffle fries. The food took a while to come out and once it did the fries were cold and tough. The poached eggs in the cold skillet were hard boiled and the portions were very tiny for the price. Very disappointed and we won't be back ."}
{"text":"Meh.  It's ok.  We really liked the atmosphere , decorating etc.  We need more restaurants like this in Chandler.   Food was good if a bit over priced.  Good quality ingredients but not a huge wow factor.   The cocktails were extremely over priced.  I ordered a $12 old fashioned that was nowhere near a true old fashioned.  Drowned in ice with a slice of Orange and no sweet at all.  Wife's cocktails were fair at best and most are $11-12.   So great to have live music too, problem is the volume is at 11.  Can't hear the person next to you, we were screaming the whole night.   There is a separate room that is quieter so we may try that next time."}
{"text":"Hostess ignored us for a long while when we walked in. After some time passes, she finally looks up from the computer and acknowledges our presence. We are seated. Music is so loud it's hard to have a conversation. We wait for twenty minutes. The waitresses swan back and forth taking care of everyone else in the restaurant. It's like we're invisible. Finally a manager takes note and we place our order. Eggs Benedict arrives at room temperature..cold. Potatoes are good. Wife enjoyed her food. I don't recommend this place. Maybe after some time they'll get their act together."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for breakfast, the food was good, reminds me of BLD as far as pricing, just not as many options As BLD. We ordered the \"American\" and \"Chicken fried Chicken\" skillets and both were very good. The atmosphere was nice, not too crowded. The mimosa was great, didn't skimp on champagne in the mimosa, and the belini was good as well. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"What a friendly environment with excellent service. My grilled chicken sandwich was fresh and delicious along with side salad. I'll be coming back often to eat here."}
{"text":"Great new spot. Stopped I for brunch today. Great upbeat atmosphere. DJ playing a fun mix and a cool vibe. Upscale and casual at the same time. And the food was wonderful, with a great mix of options. Saw some familiar servers from other spots nearby, which is great news for them, they are some of the best around!  Great job, well done, can't wait to be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid for happy hour! The heirloom toast was delicious. I also got the one with ricotta and prosciutto quite good, but I ended up pulling the basil off. It was overpowering the meat! I think it's a little loud in there and maybe some of those acoustic boards on the celling could help. It wasn't horrible though. I could still hear my husband and another gentleman we were talking to at the bar. Drinks were pretty reasonably priced and the Tito's and soda with lime (The T Rex) was not over or under poured. It was well worth the $5 and came in a tall glass. Whether they poached the Living Room and La Sala servers or not really has nothing to do with anything. I work nearby in the same business park and I'm happy to have a new nice place in the Ocotillo area that isn't part of the \"room\" monopoly?!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get drinks. I got breakfast there for the first time a couple of days ago and their eggs were way over cooked but the flavor was great. Next time I would probably ask for new eggs but I was starving and everything else tasted great. So, I'll give it 5 stars for drinks and ambiance and 3 stars for food, but averaging 4."}
{"text":"First of all this place had the coolest chandelier over the bar. Super clean, beautiful decor and tonight they have live entertainment that is really good. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I might go back for happy hour but not impressed with the service. The food was above average but a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This place oozes cool. A fun and brunchy atmosphere with large windows and modern decor. Our server was fantastic and others checked on us often. The food is a bit pricey but they give you tons. We got a skillet and the BTA Benedict. Both were delicious. The skillet was served in an actual cast iron skillet which was pretty cool. Great place to bring a friend or have a girls day brunch."}
{"text":"This place has a very cool vibe. There are 2 sides, the post and the Meridiem (which is the M) from PM. Ask Ryan what it means. Great wine options and eats are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. 2 bars, very modern, friendly staff, good food. A must frequent in chandler."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time 8--13-17 not sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised! Had the Italian hoagie, it wasn't on the brunch menus but they said \"No Problem\". Sandwitch was spot on.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here after coming for a special event. Came today for my birthday with my husband and adult kids. The atmosphere is amazing , love the decor, food was great, service not so good. Started out with a gentleman taking our drink order made us feel like we were bothering him. My kids told him it was my birthday, he could have cared less. Took a while for our drinks mine didn't come, then a young lady came with 2 of the drinks that we already received and and mine but mine was wrong. Took close to an hour for our food to arrive, then waited quite a while for the bill. I'll give them another chance because the food was so good and the restaurant is so pretty. My only complaint was the service, that is such an important part of the dinning experience. Otherwise I would definitely give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the caprese salad and it was lack luster. There was no salt, pepper or even olive oil and the tomatoes were not ripe. The balsamic reduction was good however. I also had the hashtag fries which to me were overdone. Hopefully this is just new restaurant issues because I really want to like this place!"}
{"text":"The toppings on toast ( bruschetta) is delicious. The ambiance is great and I really enjoyed it. The live music is really too loud for a conversation but that's my only problem with this place and I will be going back many times."}
{"text":"The crab and artichoke dip was different, it was half and half at our table on liking it (the little pita breads it comes with were perfect).  The stuffed jalapeños were delicious, not real hot and not greasy.  The shrimp pasta and avocado chicken sandwich were both good and filling.  The bar was unfamiliar on making a traditional whiskey sour with egg white, but their unconventional attempt turned out good.  A good environment, only needed more comfortable seating for a longer stay to talk and enjoy the night out."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews on places. But this wasn't a good experience at all. We went in, it took a few moments before we were seated (which is fine), I ordered a mimosa (lots of champagne! It was solid), we put our order in....and we waited. And waited. And waited. After 30 minutes, my man suggested we go elsewhere, but I wanted to give them a chance and the food sounded great! But when I saw people coming in, ordering and getting their food while we were waiting, I lost my patience. I paid for the mimosa and left. Waiting for that long for food (40+ minutes) and having no one check up on us doesn't warrant more than one star in my book. Beautiful interior, but idk what was going on with our food. Two stars because the mimosa was awesome and the bartender was so nice."}
{"text":"A colleague and I were looking for new places for lunch time, and we decided to try Meridiem.   Very glad we did as the food was really good, the price was just right, and our server, Karissa, was absolutely awesome!!  My colleague and I will definitely be back, and we hope to have Karissa as our server once again."}
{"text":"We just hosted a happy hour there for about 15 clients and friends and the service was outstanding!  We had every appetizer on the menu and they were all excellent.  The ambiance was very cool.  I'm looking forward to going back again real soon."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on the weekend and sat outside. The building is situated so there are a lot of good seats in the shade. The food was flavorful and there was a good selection of items to choose from. We brought our kids and they enjoyed their kid's breakfast. Our server was top notch. The only reason I hesitate to give this restaurant 5 stars is because I would like to keep this place all to ourselves and not tell the rest of the world about it. The Meridiem will most definitely be on our frequently visited list."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful service.  I try to limit my sugar intake which is very difficult with adult beverages.  My server and bartender did an amazing job for me.  Thank you for making me feel valued and cared for."}
{"text":"loved this place.  What a great atmosphere. Like music and tables spaced nicely, lively, and bright. The food selection was a perfect amount not too overwhelming.  I had the sunrise biscuits and gravy item; it was delicious! So full of flavor, the seasoning spot on!!  My husband had the chicken fried chicken skillet. He liked it so much he ate every last bite. He never finishes off his plate specially breakfast! Service was ok nothing extraordinary, but also not at all bad. We can not wait to return and try something else."}
{"text":"I was here this week with my girlfriends for lunch and we were disappointed with several things.  We arrived and though our waiter checked on us immediately and took our orders and was very friendly, it took a DANG long time to get our food... like it makes no sense because there were not that many other people there :\  At one point I looked back towards the kitchen from the patio to see wtf was going on that it was taking so long and he came and said he saw it being plated... pfff.. seriously, it was too long of a wait for a weekday lunch.  Of course at this point we're all really damn hungry so when it finally came out, we kinda just felt disappointed at seeing the plates.  Ahi tuna salad portion is ridiculously meager. Like 4 tiny slivers of ahi tuna and there was nothing \"chopped\" about the salad, it was just lettuce and big chunks of cucumber. Definitely disappointing.  I had the Avocado chicken. THe breast was on the very dry side and it wasn't even warm or moist... the bacon on top of it was dry and room temp. Not sure what happened to my dish.. maybe it sat alllll that time forgotten.  Big flop.  My friend's BLT had soggy bread (yuk) and her \"hashtag\" fries were stale... again, flop.  This was our first time here and I was really looking forward to trying it out but it really missed the spot on food timing and food in general.. there are so many better options in Chandler than this and basically I have zero interest in returning.  Sorry, I tried."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Meridiem Kitchen and Lounge last night...!  Rewind to this morning... had a few colleagues/friends text me that they were in town and would we like to hang out - they were staying in Chandler and I live in Gilbert. Been hearing about this place and wanted to try it out and coincidentally they were staying close by...  4 of us ended up stopping by... bunch of appetizers, few bottles of wine, a number of Tito's and soda and we closed the place down.  Ambiance - we started at the bar and then Ryan, an owner, that I actually knew from another lounge came by and said hello... he set us up outside on a beautiful night with a firepit and great couches/seating.  Service - They do a thing where they are team serving... so you don't necessarily get to know one specific server... and sometimes the coordination gets mixed up so their attentiveness can be spotty but this is a minor issue overall.  Drink and food - Good value here.. we ended up hitting the end of Happy Hour and ordering a bunch of appetizers that we shared. With the food and the drink the value was definitely there...  If you're down by Chandler Fashion Square, and looking for a place to hang out and get a bite... you should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch today. We will definitely be back. The food was amazing - had the topped toasts (bruschetta) and power food salad. Atmosphere was great,  including DJ who played music.  Angie, our server, was very friendly and took great care of us."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Very open environment with outdoor seating, too. Came on a Saturday to watch football and grab a Bloody Mary. I had the toppings on toast: ribeye and heirloom. Very good! I got a spicy Bloody Mary and it was great. Not the typical Zing Zang mix and vodka. It was nicely dressed. They had live music going on, too."}
{"text":"Look, I'm going to level with you here about issues people have brought up.  Is it a tad on the loud side?  Sure.  The floors are polished concrete and the walls are glass and the roof is made from endangered snow leopard skulls (one of those things may be fake).  But it's not OVERWHELMINGLY loud.  It's just loud, with music and such, which is nice because there's nothing worse than going for happy hour somewhere and being able to hear yourself think.  If I wanted to listen to myself think, I wouldn't be out suffocating my brain with alcohol.  Is the food amazing?  Hell, I don't know.  What do you even like?  Do you like simple stuff?  They do pretty solid bruschetta, We had like 3 different types and they were only $3 a piece on happy hour and of good size (real talk, Meridiem:  I love basil, but it doesn't really belong on the one with prosciutto.  Let the meat and cheese shine on that one.  Keep it on the caprese one though).    There were some middle-aged dudes with rhinestone studded jeans there trying to impress the younger female bartender by ordering the most expensive thing on the menu, which was a steak and potatoes which I initially scoffed at like a wiener...but it actually looked really well cooked, I was impressed.  The guys took like 2 bites and then asked for a box because they had no intention of eating it, they just wanted an excuse to pull out their AMEX and hope someone was impressed (they weren't..it was a gold AMEX, come on dude.  No one gets excited for anything less than a black card, sheesh).  And that leads me to the next question:  Is the clientele just a repeat of the upper-middle class faux-posh pseudo-cast of the Real Housewives of Chandler that tends to haunt everything in the Ocotillo area?  Sure, a little bit (so far).  There was a small smattering of the chalky-skinned burlap sacks of overly tanned makeup that take residence at The Living Room down the road, and the guys that look like they're hunting for those women.  But there's also a happy hour crowd, and random people that wandered over from the hotels, and the DJ helps bring the mood down about 10 years, so it's really not bad at all.  It's actually a solid spot for people watching and there are a lot of normal jeans and t-shirts type people there, and polo wearing folks that just got off of work down the road.  You're not out of place there no matter what.  But overall, the big questions is:  is it a good place to go?  And so far the answer is a resounding YES.  The prices are great considering how nice this place is inside.  $5 glasses of wine (a lot of them, even some local!) during happy hour.  Food at various price points, and they're not stingy (hopefully that doesn't change).  Decent music, great ambiance, some good drinks for cheap ($5 old fashioned poured so you actually taste whiskey before the ice melts).    Check it out while you still can, because there isn't much else near there and this place is going to stay constantly filled up for a while.    BRB, gotta go order the steak with my Silver Wells Fargo card and see if anyone is impressed."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in the east valley. The food and service is phenomenal. The atmosphere of the place is absolutely incredible. This is my go to place when I have visitors from other states. I highly recommend this place and give it five stars..."}
{"text":"Came in for a \"quick\" lunch, our 3rd time to visit.  they were moderately busy.  We sat at the bar,  1 of 2 couples at the bar.  First drinks were served promptly, but everything else took a super long time.   After 3 visits, my overall impression: -service is slow, bartenders need to look up, make eye contact and take queues (menu folded means ready to order, empty drinks means we might want a refill)... -drinks and food are good (we've done breakfast and lunch), but be prepared to wait -service is friendly!  Ambiance is really nice!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great.  With the amount of glass in the place, it can get pretty loud but also gives an opportunity to eavesdrop in other tables' conversations because of the acoustics. I will definitely be back again for breakfast.  This adds on another late night dining option for those of us who work night shift."}
{"text":"This place is \" Off the hook \" it's a combination of tasty food,great atmosphere and reasonable pricing. The atmosphere is multi-cultural mixture of people with music, TVs and conversation.    Thank you Ryan and Jason   PS try the breakfast menu    Eric"}
{"text":"Just effin WOW!!!!Chandler is on the Map!!!everything you could want as a local or visitor. Hip, cool music, food is all day long top of its game whether it's a burger or Rib Eye. 2 separate bar areas, super experienced bar tenders , truly supports the local breweries. As weather permits the all glass walls open to giant patios with outdoor seating.  This is the big leagues, clearly the cars out front are an indication to dress your best ...Good job Ryan and thanks for introducing yourself"}
{"text":"What an amazing new place in Chandler.  The owners really thought this layout through. Great food, music and yes an air conditioned outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Three of us for lunch. Seemed like lots of open tables but we're seated just outside the kitchen door -NEVER SIT THERE AGAIN. Very close to traffic pattern.  Restaurant very noisy with little sound absorption. All three sandwiches very good and more than adequate in size. Nicole provided us with a good preview of breakfast menu as well as lunch. Service was good and check prepared early at my request. Definitely want to go try breakfast. Love the jelly beans at the hostess desk."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's brought me here in the am. Along with breakfast. Ordered up the eggs Benedict and they were really good. The eggs were not poached perfectly but were over cooked as Gordon would say. As a result I requested additional hollandaise sauce which made it better. Bloody Mary's were made to perfection with a good spice! Props!! Pricey treat well worth it. The glass feature over the bar was beautiful! The way the wine is housed and showcased is outstanding. They have a nice patio outside. All the deco elements come together in a modern, clean look that has good energy that flows well throughout the space that is utilized in the best form."}
{"text":"Had the salmon and asparagus and it was great. Mostly a gathering place for a good cocktail or wine with good food thrown in."}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Loud. Very loud. But good seating. There is an outside patio. Bartenders did well.  Loved the Power Salad with Steak. Cooked to my desire. Salad portion was light but steak plentiful. All good. Nice vinaigrette. I liked the wine I selected. They offered a taste. Washington State Disruption Cab. Good body.  Menus not huge but probably works for most. Would come back."}
{"text":"Coffee is terrible. Food was okay.   The waitress we had was vaping inside of the building at the bar.   Slow service for us being the only one in there. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 5 stars They have a great patio, cool bar, beautiful open space with huge sliding glass doors, modern, bright and relaxing vibe.   Food - 4 stars We had breakfast. Planning to come back for dinner one night. The breakfast nachos were a fun menu item and tasty! I had a skillet that came out wrong. They fixed it and got me the potatoes that were supposed to be in it. But it's always annoying to have an incomplete meal in front of you while everyone else is eating.   Service - 3 stars (and that's being nice) Customer service will make or break a place every time (in my opinion). Service is lacking here big-time! Some training would be useful. Even just a friendly welcome would go a long way. I am thinking the owner may have sat us, but even he wasn't that friendly. He seemed busy with other tasks he wanted to get back to. The bartender helped us since the server was wandering around with a solemn face - she was \"sort of working\", but most of the tables seemed to be lacking any real attention (and they were not busy). The bartender was friendly enough (but like I said, my order got messed up somewhere along the way). Just no real welcoming, friendly vibe here at all.  I'll be back for dinner and will write another review then...."}
{"text":"Ordered drinks which took them over 20-30 min to get. Even after checking multiple times and ensuring vegetarian food, they gave me beef! I am a person who never ate non-vegetarian food my entire life, you can imagine how it felt. It was ridiculous and could sense they did not even feel bad about it, manager was not even apologetic about it. Never returning here!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in a strange location--although the area is certainly growing. The atmosphere is so lovely and there was plenty of space for our large group. Service was super attentive. We had some appetizers and drinks. The patio area is large and they do accept dogs. We will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed with this very nice looking establishment. Short version: Food is 2-star, staff is 2-star and the decor is 4-star.   Went on Mother's Day and made a reservation via OpenTable. Showed up and they put us on the wait list along with everyone else. How can you take a reservation but not actually hold a table??  The hostess team at the front couldn't care less, very poor attitudes for front of house. Finally seated 45 minutes later. Our waitress was short with us and seemed swamped.  I get that it is Mother's Day, but staff up properly. There were a lot of people running around but it seemed disorganized. I've worked in restaurants, this place needs better management.   Food took one hour to show up. The table next to us had to get up and get their own silverware.  Crazy.   The chicken sandwich was basic and I'd put a dollar value of half of what they charged. Waffle fries were seasoned with some strange ingredient. How do you mess up waffle fries?!? My wife's breakfast nachos were subpar, too. Only my daughter's griddle cakes seemed on point.    Finally, the place is beautiful. Well decorated. But it is noisy. The acoustics are not good, there is nothing but glass and concrete, so the noise from other tables reverberates. Add to that some DJ guy that has no sense of volume control and you will have a hard time trying to carry on a conversation with the people at your table. When we asked if the music volume could be lowered, we got a quick, snotty \"No\" from our waitress. There are a lot of ways to say No, she needs to figure out how a good customer service person says No without coming off short and rude.   I had high hopes but this place is all flash and no substance. If I were a hipster looking to have a glass of wine with friends, this would be a good choice. As a sit down restaurant, it disappoints on so many levels."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic here, I had a grilled cheese sandwich and it was amazing. Kids menu is really good too. The only downside is that it's very loud inside, but other than that it's great for families and for a wine bar too."}
{"text":"Trendy modern atmosphere! Loved the open concept dining area and bar. Great food, wine, and service! Definitely making this one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"Ordered the antipasto skewers and ate one and a half of them before I looked down and realized they were moldy. All of them. I don't even want to know how long those had been sitting out already prepped for to grow mold. And it wasn't a tiny spot on just the cheese either. It was all over the salami too. So disgusting. Sent it back to the kitchen and Bill apologized profusely. He felt terrible about it. He comped us the appetizers, but we still paid for our drinks and left asap. Won't be back. I'm wondering what other bacteria was all over that and hoping I don't get food poisoning. UPDATE: sick as a dog. So upset :("}
{"text":"Very unexpectedly great food! I went to Meridiem for the first time expecting it to be more like bar food but it ended up being far from it. Wonderful chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy and the hidden gem we're the potatoes. They look normal but are definitely something to order, not to disappoint."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. They have some healthy options which is a plus. Great ambiance and right off the Freeway in the Price corridor. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Second time here. A nice addition to the Chandler area. Great atmosphere and service. Brunch menu was great.  Ate the scramble which was wonderful. They had a DJ too which played wonderful choices of music.  Would recommend this place !"}
{"text":"OK, I am going to keep this review simple and to the point. The setup is really nice, even though it is a blatant ripoff of Postino, and that is the only reason I can think of to be polite about this review. This place is grossly overpriced, the food we ordered was over cooked, small for the price ($15 for four over cooked and small shrimp). The Calamari was dried out and tasteless, and they served it with cocktail sauce...WTF? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My disappointment with this place compounds by the minute.  I was shocked to see reviews that people were able to have lunch in an hour here.  I really want to like this place.  I want to like this place so much that after it took a full hour for our food to arrive I asked to speak to the manager.  I let her know that an hour for lunch is going to be too long for people working in the area.  I understood since we had 9 people that it might be a little longer.  I know it's hard to get 9 people's food out at the same time.  So, I had ordered an appetizer.  Let's get some food in while we wait for our meals.  Except that the appetizer came out AFTER my meal.  So I mentioned that, too, and the manager was happy to box up my appetizer for me.  I didn't expect to get anything taken off my check (and I didn't), but for some reason, I DID expect for the service to speed up after my complaint.  Instead, it took 20 minutes for us to get our checks after we HAND-DELIVERED them to the staff since no one had come back to pick them up. I'm rolling my eyes at the fact that it took me an hour and 45 minutes to eat lunch today, and now I have to stay 45 minutes late at work to make up for their poor efficiency.  I fully expect this place to improve as they learn these things, I just personally won't be back for at least a few months."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night. Not very busy, but customers scattered throughout. Loved the atmosphere and decor, very tastefully done. Big space including huge outdoor patio space with tons of seating, from couches to big chairs and smaller chairs and various sized tables. Drinks were good, we didn't get any food. Bathrooms were nice and spacious. Bartender was super sweet. We hear happy hours are good here as well as lunch. Will make it back for both."}
{"text":"Check out this new restaurant today.  The place is large with many sizes of table for two up to a large group.  There are two patios, one on the east side to you can stay out of the sun and one on the south side if you want to be in the sun.  We had the bacon wrap shrimp, they were delish.  And we shared the BLT, a simple sandwich but surprising many places can not do a good one. This was large with lots of bacon, so big that as we shared, we were both full.  That came with french fries, crisp and tender, delish. Just one tip to the management, eco friendly take out containers."}
{"text":"Had lunch at meridien in chandler arizona on Tuesday with two friends. I had the powerhouse salad. There was no feta cheese so it was very bland. It looked like the romaine was wilted but it wasn't. It was a bland and flavor free salad. I asked for some bread hoping for a piece of French. I received a piece of white dry toast. My dining partner had the chicken sandwich. The chicken was overlooked and frightfully dry. We shared the bananas foster. It was a sloppy wet mess with chocolate sauce. It wasn't busy but it took a long time for our meal to arrive. There are so many delicious restaurants in the area that we will not return to meridien - ever."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprise by this place. I had a breakfast omelet and 2 of their Delicious morning drinks. Highly recommend  if you're looking for a nice please with excellent service."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying we had about 9 of us yesterday and they got us seated right away. The parking lot was pretty full. The food had great portions. The best part of last night was our server Sheree. She was very attentive and quick on her feet. Not once did any of us have to look for her. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! My friend and I went last night and had the most enjoyable time. The atmosphere was energetic and lively. The glass room that holds the wine bottles is eye catching. The chandelier over the bar is amazing to see. We enjoyed some Cabernet and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.   Went for breakfast. Service was great.   Food was pretty good.  Not so amazing that I want to come back.  Not a good value.  Overpriced."}
{"text":"Back for breakfast and was not as impressed the first time we ate here. Service was ridiculously slow with only 4 tables occupied. Food came in shifts and was not as requested. Server didn't write our order down, so you know how that goes...you end up asking for everything 2-3 times! Potatoes over cooked and chicken fried chicken was served with no gravy. Disappointed in today's visit so changed rating from 5 to 2."}
{"text":"Awesome wine bar. Great selection of wine and food. If you like a craft beer... Only a couple of options.  The patio and bars are a great gathering place.  Gotta love the look."}
{"text":"Made a reservation 3 weeks ago do Mother's Day. Showed up and they have a 2 - 3 hour wait for all reservations. That's right ALL of us who made reservations were told to wait an additional 2-3 hours. So 11am got sat at 1-2pm. We happened to have 3 children with us, one of them being special needs which was explained when making the reservation, and still no accommodation. Even the owner went out of his way to avoid the clients and let his wait staff stand around and do nothing but take the brunt of people yelling at them. Customers were literally fighting in the lobby over reservations.   I should add we just rented this place out for a business function Wednesday.   I will add that after we were seated the food was good and the owner did go out of his way to apologize. Will give this place another shot."}
{"text":"The place to be. Third time there. Great awesome all the way around. From top to bottom, In or outside. From beers to food, can't beat it. Don't be left out, go where the awesomeness is."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Delicious salad. Great atmosphere and layout. Turned out to be a perfect lunch spot for me while traveling. Wouldn't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"I've now experienced Meridiem for breakfast, lunch, and sort of dinner Happy Hour. All three times I've visited have been great. Breakfast was really delicious, we ordered the pancakes which are ginormous!! Our daughter ordered the kids French Toast sticks (they make from scratch which is flipping amazing!) the sticks were great! I had an egg white omelette with veggies and potatoes. My lunch there was good too, I ordered a Caprese salad and added a chicken breast. My only suggestion would be to have an even better priced Happy Hour. Their wines seem to be on the expensive side and Happy Hour doesn't make them that much more affordable. I'd like to see something close to Postinos pricing. I don't want to shell out $50.00 every time I meet my friends for a cocktail and snack during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"We had a lovely late lunch here yesterday. The chandelier over the bar is gorgeous. Excellent friendly service. Attractive surroundings. My chicken sandwich and side salad was very good. I really appreciated them accommodating my low carb food preferences."}
{"text":"The Acapulco for breakfast is a must! We have been here many times and the service is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday Funday $5 Bloody Mary or Mimosa. Exciting menu! Morning DJ and afternoon live music, this place is super chill !  Great service friendly staff !"}
{"text":"Very clean. Great atmosphere and the food was AMAZING! I had the artichoke dip with the cheeseburger and the burger was one of the best I've ever had. Seasoned to PERFECTION! This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  Food and service were both okay but not above average.  Too loud for a Sunday morning, probably a better place for dinner."}
{"text":"If you have children this is NOT your place to go. This establishment seats roughly 200 and they have 3 high chairs and 1 booster seat. While questioning the manager he was rude, nonchalant and gave the excuse that they've only been open for a few months and literally walked away while I was speaking to him. Just RUDE!! Why have a kids menu if you don't have accommodations for children? In June we came and they had very few things on the menu, which the same manager, made the same excuse of being newly opened. I imagine once they are ready for opening, this will be a great place."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a fabulous spot in Chandler, my new fav!  The chicken fried chicken was amazing, staff is very attentive and super friendly. I cannot wait to try dinner here. Happy belly!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Great ambiance, amazing wine...We ordered the crab spinach artichoke dip and pretzel sticks, both were fabulous!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch today and the food and atmosphere were great. We were greeted by a really friendly hostess that sat us promptly. Our waiter was extremely friendly and welcoming and asked if we had been there before, and we hadn't, and preceded to welcome us. I ordered the grilled cheese and WOW! It was so good, but I'm a stickler for chipotle mayo which this sandwich had. The bacon on it was just the right amount of crispiness and totally hit the spot. My husband ordered the steak sandwich with fries, and though the meat and cheese on the sandwich had amazing flavor, the hoagie roll it came on was extremely hard and inedible, we told the waiter and he apologized profusely and quickly fixed the sandwich and brought a new one out with bread that was perfect. I can totally see us coming here again! A must dine spot!"}
{"text":"Good food but way overpriced! Service was slow. Server never checked up on us or refilled drinks. They weren't busy so what was the problem?"}
{"text":"I found this listing on Yelp. After seeing the pics and reviews, I was pretty excited. We came here to meet up with a friend for lunch on Saturday. It's a beautiful environment, with well appointed decorations. The staff are amazingly attentive and friendly.   We sat down to the Brunch menu (it was 12:30 & brunch went until 2:00). My other half couldn't find anything she could order, and they quickly let us know we could order off the dinner menu too.   After reviewing the menu, we all decided  to go with the Power salad. My partner changed out the feta cheese and asked if she could have romaine instead of kale. They gladly complied. Very nice.   So why the three stars do you ask? That salad we all got was so dry, overloaded with nuts and cranberries, and just plain boring. In fact, we were all shocked. I am unsure what is \"power \"about a cup of cranberries and a cup of almonds in a pile of dried kale, topped with another cup of crumbled dry feta cheese. And my partner's salad was a bowl of romaine chopped lettuce topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan and the same nut and cranberry mixture. We all ate quietly, because I think we didn't want to embarrass one another that the salad was so odd.  Again, mind you,  the inside facility was simply stunning with the decorations. As one entered into the female bathroom, there was a separate front area for washing one's hands that was simply lovely.  There was a painted saying on the wall stated \"How lovely you are!\"   These are all great touches! However, I actually came to enjoy the food. I was rather sad that I invited my friend to come here. But I didn't know until I partook. I've heard the drinks are really great here from our hotel staff. So I guess if I ever come back, that's all I'm Coming in for."}
{"text":"Drive by this place all the time finally had to try it. Server was pleasant ordered the crab artichoke dip amazing!!! For entrées I ordered the ribeye with wasabi mash potatoes and spinach Unfortunately this were we start heading down hill. My steak was not SEASONED at all no salt and pepper on the tables to try to save the steak and one half of the steak was over done while the other half was way under done. The spinach came in cup there was literally a tablespoon of raw garlic that wasn't cook in the middle of the pile now that was a surprise when I bit into that. It seem like they threw the garlic in to late when cooking the spinach. The wasabi mash was great but not hot at all more like room temperature. My wife ordered the shrimp with the vodka sauce. Once again the sauce was very BLAND but the shrimp was cooked perfectly. I will return to try out the breakfast menu hopefully we get some bold flavors."}
{"text":"Great patio and atmosphere! Great lil find tucked away in south Chandler!! Wonderful service and food and drinks were just right."}
{"text":"Trying this brand new restaurant just opened in the last couple days. My wife and I stopped in mid-afternoon. There were several customers at the bar, but none at the tables.   My wife had the chicken breast over hummus with a salad and sautéed spinach. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. The hummus paired with it perfectly. The spinach was outstanding, garlicky, nutty and buttery. The only slight complaint she had was that the vinaigrette was a bit too tart to pair with the rest of the meal.   I had two starters, the bacon-wrapped shrimp and Pop's meatballs.  Both paired very well with the Joseph Carr Cabernet Sauvignon.   The shrimp was awesome, cooked to perfect tenderness and wrapped in smokey, crispy, bacony goodness!  It was served with a buttery sauce and a tangy plum(?) sauce. Yummy!  The meatballs I thought were just ok. They had a very herbaceous taste, with a lot of oregano. That was the dominant flavor of the dish. The meatballs are served with a chunky marinara sauce and under a coat of melted mozzarella.   The place is very modern, with a mix of normal tables/chairs, some low chairs, and small sofa/table combos. It is all hard surfaces, glass walls, corrugated steel ceiling, and concrete floors. It will be very noisy with a full house. You might want to bring your ear plugs."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and have had a good experience every time. Great food, friendly staff and the outside couch sitting areas make you feel like you are at a resort. They are also the best place for brunch on the weekends. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was great. Our server Abby went above and beyond our expectations. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place due to it's aesthetics and online menu, so I decided to try out. While it did have some strong points, I put a lot of emphasis on customer service. The customer serviced was a huge disappointment.   When I arrived at the location, I was immediately amazed by it. It is located on a remote plot of land. There are plenty of businesses, roads around there, but for some reason, this location didn't have very many large buildings around it, making it feel secluded and very open. The building itself is beautiful. It's trendy, modern, and open. It has varied seating including indoor/outdoor, high-top, low-top, bar, private area, lounge seating, etc. Whatever your mood, take your pick! They do have TVs placed tactfully throughout as well. There isn't a very clear pathway to the patio, so anyone wanting to go there will have to go through a bunch of tables. The bathrooms were set up in a neat layout.  I made reservations on Open Table for Sunday brunch, 11am. When we got there, the employee said they didn't have the reservation. It worked out for us since we got seated right away. It was busy, but it wasn't overly packed. I'm not sure if there was a system issue or whatnot.  It wasn't an issue at this point, but I can foresee this being an issue if a reservation is not found during a busy time.  Anyway, when we sat and looked at the menu, I noticed it was all lunch or dinner items. They call that menu the \"PM\" or \"Post\" menu. It took a while for our waitress to come around and when she finally did, we asked for the breakfast menu. They call it the \"Pre\" or \"AM\" menu. I noticed everyone seated after us had the same experience and felt it was weird the employees didn't check to see which menu we wanted or automatically give us the breakfast menu, since it was very much so in the morning.  The remainder of the service was slow and unimpressive. Everyone was very nice and helpful, but it was minimal, and it took a while for everything. When our food finally came out, the food was incorrect. My friend and I both ordered omelettes, and the food they delivered was a hybrid of our two orders. I received items I didn't ask for and hers was missing items. They took the appropriate steps to rectify the situation, but the overall experience remained lackluster.  The food options looked great, and I did enjoy my omelette, although slightly too greasy. The Peach Bellini is DELISH. Portion sizes are fair for the price. I did notice they have a happy hour, and I really liked the place. I hope to come back with a better experience."}
{"text":"Our group had the best night at the Meridiem on Saturday. The live music was fantastic and food was great. I ordered the buffalo chicken empanadas and the chicken sandwich. Both I will definitely be getting again! Our waiter was very attentive and on top of it. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very very good!  Loved the ambiance as well as the decor!  Ordered the ribeye and eggs along with the potatoes for breakfast and shared a biscuit and sausage gravy with a poached egg with a friend.  He had the pancakes with Nutella and bananas.   The steak and eggs were good, really good!  Ribeye cooked to perfection!  The sausage gravy and biscuits were other worldly though...seriously a must have if you eat here!    I tried my friends pancakes and we both agreed too much Nutella.  More likes crepes though if you ask me.  The Bloody Mary and mimosa was excellent!    A great find!"}
{"text":"The Meridiem is a much needed bar and lounge in the area. They're just getting started, but already the food, atmosphere, and service are incredible. The breakfast menu is amazing, check out the breakfast nachos! For dinner the topped toasts are phenomenal, especially the ribeye. Live DJs and a huge bar that top the environment make this a spot to keep an eye on!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have loved the food every time. It is very very good.  The ham and cheese sliders are awesome as are their scrambled eggs are bomb.  They have pretty good and varying drinks and a good brunch menu.  It's also got a really cool ambience.  Servers have always been great.  One thing for kids is they run out high chairs almost every time we come. They have booster seats which suffice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this restaurant. The atmosphere is great-very open, floor to ceiling windows, very laid back & airy. Our food on the other hand was very, very, heavy- flavors all very good, but too much for our taste.  I ordered  the soup of the day, tortilla soup. When it arrived I thought I'd been given a dish of sweet potatoes. No spoon was needed, nor was I given one.  It tasted good, it just wasn't soup.  The two other dish I ordered was the same way, 3 meatballs-had to find the meatballs because swimming in marina and cheese-thought I'd mistakingly ordred lasagna. My daughter's grill cheese sandwich was as described,  except there was a long black hair in her side-salad. Despite the atmosphere, it was a no-win at the Meridiem. It is a cool place. The style of food wasn't for us. I will probably go back for drinks & the atmosphete."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere especially when the weather isn't too hot. Every time we've been here the service is on point. Great for families too as there is a ton of open space for kids to run. Good food too!"}
{"text":"First, the service is a tad slow but friendly! Second, the meal I had had a lovely presentation, great portion but lacked a bit on seasoning. They should automatically bring out salt, pepper & hot sauce with the meals. Otherwise it was great! The ice cream sandwiches were served with fresh, warm cookies! Yum. That brings it up a star. So, don't be in a rush and don't be scared to ask for salt, pepper, etc. *Get the ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious little stop after checking into our hotel.  We were starving and they did not disappoint!  Yummy food, service is why no five stars...we got juggled around but we did get taken care of eventually. It was dead. Drinks should have been much quicker than the 5-10 minutes we waited. We both had time to use the restroom separately before the drinks arrived. Also, it was happy hour and we got charged full price. It also got taken care of but we should Not have had to deal w that. But the food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a 12:15 reservation. Was told it would be an additional 30-60 minutes. After being seated, it was total chaos. No silverware. Buffet was empty. Waited 20 minutes for the check. A total $&@ Show!! If you are going to be open Mother's Day, please be prepared!!!"}
{"text":"Meridiem Kitchen and Lounge was my first breakfast spot that I had eaten in the Arizona area when I went on vacation. I chose this spot because it was easy to make reservations and I didn't want to wait in any line.   When we got here we noticed that this place is still pretty new since they didn't even get their sign board ok top of the store done yet.   Walking inside it feels modern and cozy at the same time. We each ordered a breakfast and a cup of coffee to go with the meal. They refilled our cup about three times and the food was actually pretty good!!   I ordered their traditional breakfast and it came with so much food. Got the sausage and it came with two round sausage patties, eggs that you can choose and I had chosen scrambled, potatoes and also your choice of bread which I had gotten wheat. Overall the breakfast was super filling and I enjoyed it the most.   Got to spend time with friends during the holidays is always eventful!"}
{"text":"Other than needing a few more TV's on the patio area, the service and food was good! Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Tried this new place for the first time. It was good! It honestly did remind me of BLD which is another nearby restaurant. Menu was insane with options but it was enough!   I tried their Meridian burger off of their lunch menu. It as good. It wouldn't be the 1st place I'd go to for a burger though. It was satisfying enough to like it l. Add the fried egg if you do try it though.   The inside of the place was nice looking. Customer service was great as well. I was able to get in and out for my lunch hour with extra time. I went at 12:00PM too. Figured it was gonna be slammed.  Side note: they have a pretty cool bar side too with a decent selection of drinks and things on tap.   Food - 3/5 Customer service - 5/5 Restaurant cleanliness- 5/5 Restaurant vibe - 4/5   I'll most likely try this place once more for breakfast and update this"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we have been fans of Meridiem since it opened. This past weekend we were in around 830/9am for breakfast and the service was friendly but we had two issues.  1. When my baby started fussing I went to change him and to my surprise I looked in every stall and no changing table. I asked a server where theirs was and he didn't know so he asked a female server. She said they didn't have one. I knew it wasn't her fault but I reacted with surprise and was upset -where am I supposed to change my baby? Thank goodness she was kind enough and came up with an idea.. she took me to a private bathroom for private parties or the staff and asked if this would work. She pointed to a small end table or dresser and of course being a mom you just make it work. I appreciated her but couldn't believe a new restaurant in 2018 wouldn't have one, safe area to change a baby. I also want to be clear that there were at least 6 other families dining with young children - it's not like it's only a bar. I was very disappointed.  2. We ordered sliders and biscuits and gravy and it took over 50 min just to get our food. We saw other tables waiting just as long. Very slow for breakfast.  Again, we enjoy the food, the restaurant ambiance is nice, and the servers are friendly but the two issues above made it very hard to enjoy our dining experience last weekend."}
{"text":"Glad to have a restaurant in this location. The space was nice. Large and bright. Welcoming colors. The menu was \"okay\" but I got a salad and they had no choices for dressing for me. I was looking for a balsamic/vinegar mix or a clear( vegan) type and there just wasn't an option so I did not eat."}
{"text":"Terrible service and no one was even in this place! The young man who served us could not remember anything we said literally. Took ten minutes to get water and we had to get our food to go after an hour lunch. Beautiful place but terrible service!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly but quite slow. It wasn't busy but they didn't seem in a hurry.  the restaurant design was casual nice. The food was good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Our chicken and hummus was really good not a whole lot of selection on the menu. Busy fun location good music and indoor and outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Great environment morning or evening, and perfect food to compliment a relaxed brunch or comfortable night out with people whose company you enjoy. I've had great experiences with the servers who are attentive but by no means on your face."}
{"text":"Hot new spot in Chandler. Definitely check it out. The cocktails are on point (love the old fashioneds). The food is great. The decor is hip. And the service is off the charts. The bartenders and waitresses will never leave you hanging. Good vibe and good times."}
{"text":"Great spot to relax. Great atmosphere and layout. The bartender, Nicole, does an amazing job. Always knows my fav cocktail. Very friendly, professional and attentive. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate at this new restaurant near my home, Meridiem. The staff was very friendly, welcoming, attentive, and checked back to see how things were. I had Salmon and Penne with vodka sauce. My friend had their famous hamburger and it was huge. The presentation for both entrees were unique and well above average. Meridiem is a little pricey, but we felt we got a lot of food and it was delicious. Will definitely be back and highly recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"First time eating/drinking at Meridiem and we weren't impressed. Food and drinks were good but the service was poor at best. Came with a party of about twenty, had a reservation that was confirmed earlier in the day but when we showed up we weren't given the tables we required. Instead, they grabbed a couple of tables and put them together. Made it really hard to socialize and communicate with the rest of the party. We watched the same attendant/bus boy walk by with his hands in his pockets at least twenty times without even asking to take any glassware or plates from our table. Looked like a war zone at our table. Place is cool to have some drinks at if your at the bar inside, other than that this will be our last time coming to this establishment.   **Live music/DJ was trash!**"}
{"text":"New Chandler restaurant and lounge. This place is very nice and the food is great!  HOWEVER it is very noise to the point that if the place is busy and your at a table with 6 or more people you will definitely have a hard time hearing the people at the opposite end of the table. Not even my teenage kids could hear each other at Sunday brunch when it was at best 50% occupancy.   TOO SMALL Sunday brunch food tastes great, BUT their 6\" breakfast skillets at $14 are TOO SMALL!!! I am not a large person just 6'4\" 200 pounds and I could easily eat 2 of them for brunch but $28 is a LOT to pay for Sunday brunch. They did taste great.   PLEASE fix the noise and price/portions and make this a 5 STARS must visit in Chandler."}
{"text":"For others posting they waited for reservations at 11 and sat at 1-2  pm on Mother's Day... that's an exaggeration. I'm on the porch now and it's not even 1230 yet, so they sat much quicker than that. People rarely post about good interactions just the bad ones. Today has been pretty great! It's a beautiful  morning on the patio! I have been here since 1030.. the reservation was a little delayed with a large group but they made it work. There is No where you can visit will be perfect on busy days like this.   Thanks for a good Mother's Day Meridiem!  Ps the brunch was great!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday (5/27)... the soft opening was just this past Wednesday, not sure when the grand opening is yet. However, the food and menu looked delicious!  Tried the bruschetta and salad, along with several beers and wine... food was really good (of course so were the drinks)! They do have happy hour M-F, I believe it was from 3-6. When we were there they also had a guy singing and playing the guitar... so we really enjoyed that.  Excellent to see this new restaurant in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for brunch over Labor Day weekend. The atmosphere and overall feel of the restaurant is very cool.  Spacious patio, great decor and for our group of 10 people, we had comfortable seating inside. A few of my family members had been here for dinner and mentioned it was very loud and not good for large groups. They were sitting inside so when the weather is cooler, I would suggest sitting outside on the patio if you have a large party.   The 10 of us ordered brunch. It did take a good 45 minutes to get our food. The restaurant did not seem that busy either. The waiter brought out several of our plates but 3 members of our party did not get their plates at the same time. By the time they finally got their plates most of us were done eating.   I'd love to try this restaurant again but have a little concern on the overall service."}
{"text":"Great place. Hope to get back soon. Very open and spacious. Drinks were good. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great menu any time of the day/night. Happy Hour has a nice menu selection also. Bill, the bartender, makes the best sangrias. Ask for the Sangria Girls special - you can't have just one!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 2 times and the food is great...when you get it. Both times our food came out at different times (the last time my meal came out way after he had already finished his meal...and it wasn't even what I ordered). Our waitress had way too many tables, but she was pleasant and apologetic. I worked in the restaurant business for many years and they should really look at how they seat people. No waitress should be given more tables than they can handle and no kitchen should be given more tickets than they can cook. If that means that you go on a wait...so be it. Then at least patrons can decide if they want to stay that long, instead of being seated with the impression that they are going to enjoy a regularly timed meal. This restaurant seems really \"green\" to me, but it has potential. I've actually enjoyed everything I have eaten there...the kinks and logistics just need to be worked out.   I will say, the last time the manager did give us free breakfast vouchers so we will be back to try it a third time  and probably our last if they don't get it right this time (however, the fact that you have pre-made free breakfast vouchers is never a good sign)."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and a good selection of food and drinks. Outdoor patio is welcoming with plenty of space for large groups. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great location! Amazing atmosphere!The staff is wonderful! The menu is awesome! Thank you Ryan for bringing this new \"go to\" place to Chandler! Nothing like it in the area."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the past month for breakfast, lunch, and Happy hour. The place is awesome. Great food each time, excellent cocktails and wine selection as well. You can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Super sheik and well styled bar and restaurant with a beautiful patio. Service is quick, friendly, and personal. They have titos on top, which is awesome. Drinks are reasonably priced even off happy hour and the apps were great. Our table ordered calamari, pretzel bread with cheese and the crab dip and everyone really enjoyed their dishes. Take some time to discover this little gem in Chandler, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and they do a great brunch!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my visit. Having previously looked this place up I was excited to give it a try. When I walked in a very nice young woman greeted me and after I told her I'd never been there before she sat me at the bar. I asked her if it was full service at the bar and she said yes. That seemed normal. The extremely friendly bartender (female) greeted me right away and told me about the draught beers they had. I ordered a raspberry hefeweizen that sounded delicious. She delivered me beer fast and gave me a few minutes to look at the menu.   They got pretty busy and after a few minutes another bartender (male) came over to get my food order. I asked if the empenadas we're baked or fried and after telling me they were fried he admitted they we're not his favorite. I appreciated the honesty. I ordered chips and salsa to hold me over until I had more time to decide on dinner. He recommended the burger which did sound delicious.   This is where things fell apart. Typically chips and salsa come out in a couple minutes. I sat and waited more than ten minutes -could have been closer to twenty - without the chips ever coming out. He also never came back to get my dinner order (I was gonna get the burger). After a few more minutes with no food the female bartender, who was still super nice, asked me.about another beer but at that point I decided I would be setting myself up for failure so I just paid and left. I'm not sure if they were just overwhelmed, if he forgot to put my chip order in, or what but nevertheless I say there without chips that probably come out of a bag with no follow up on his part. Leaving was the best choice. Too bad, I was looking forward to the food."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Checked it out for the first time today. Food was amazing and the portion size was great to leave satisfied and not overly full. The service was great my water was never empty and we were checked in multiple times by different people. It is a place where you come to enjoy brunch and hang out. The atmosphere is amazing - we really enjoyed our meals and ambiance. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place with a nice patio.   Our service was okay.  Waiter didn't know the specials or soup of the day and asked one person in our small group twice what he wanted to drink even though he placed an order already.  I had the power salad and added ahi tuna.  The ahi looked strange (overcooked, small thin slices).  The fish was not edible.  The salad (~$10 + $4 or $5 for the fish) was small and mostly lettuce.    The waiter did comp my meal.  The other people in my group seemed to enjoy their meals (sandwiches, soups) so perhaps those are better options."}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food, Scottsdale nightclub atmosphere. We had a reservation, got here before our scheduled time and the hostess tells us that they only take requests, not reservations, so they seated us outside(103 degrees). Drinks took forever, food took forever, party of 8 behind us was falling down drunk and they kept serving them instead of cutting them off. Our check came 30 minutes after we finished. Do I need to go on???"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were perfect. No lines on a Tuesday morning. The waitress we had was very nice and we had great time talking to her. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice.  Nice vibe, good staff. There is a good variety of seating (bar, tall tables, separate rooms, sofa, outside) First visit was very late and less busy. We had the Calamari and stuffed Peppers.  yummy bites! The second visit was during 'happy hour' it was quite busy and noisey. We could tell the kitchen was rushed when the Calamari was now  gooey and undercooked. They either rushed the cooking or didn't let the oil get up to temperature.  Our waiter brought the wrong wine and billed accordingly.  Luckily we caught the error (before he opened the bottle and before we signed the check) and they were very helpful in correcting the error.  I'd give them a second chance but go for drinks and not food when it's crowded."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch.  Awesome.  Service was adequate.  Food was slow to arrive but it all tasted good.  Forgot a few things that were supposed to come out but they retrieved in a hurry.  I will be back and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried for breakfast, I enjoyed and will return. Interesting and varied menu, well priced, something for everyone. Good coffee, hard to find that. Attentive staff. The breakfast crowd is seated in the bar area which has a mix of high tops and tables in a modern slightly industrial design. It was comfortable. There are some tables that are too close to the kitchen door and bathroom, and if your at any table facing that way you see the doors.I was disappointed by that design considering this is a new build.I did not seem well thought out. Lunch and dinner may be served in the larger adjacent dining room. I already have an upcoming dinner there and I look forward to trying that menu. It's a little hard to spit from main road, no flashy signage. Turn off price toward Drury hotel and you enter restaurant from the rear."}
{"text":"So awesome, Great service and fabulous energy! Their menu may appear across the board but their spin on everything is awesome. Their starters are fabulous and I love the avocado chicken, did I mention the service rocks and the vibe is awesome?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come back on a weeknight to see if it's a little quieter and give it another chance- especially since we liked the food the first time we were here. Tonight was worse than the first time! I arrived earlier than my friend and when I entered the front two employees completely ignored me- I finally said, \" Do I just seat myself?\" They both quickly apologized and I got seated - ok- not a big deal- But then our waitress came so fast I hadn't had time to even think about what I wanted to drink so I just said water and that I'd wait to order when my friend arrived...After reading over the menu I realized happy hour only went for 25 more minutes and I spent time trying to remember what my waitress looked like so I could quickly get in something before happy hour ended even though my friend hadn't shown up yet...Numerous wait staff zoomed past my table but my server never did come back and no one even acknowledged that I was clearly looking for someone to stop at my table to give an order to...After 25 minutes, my friend hadn't arrived yet and we decided to take our business elsewhere...I really want to like this place- but just can't...And it's just as loud on a weeknight as a Friday- Definitely a hot spot for business people going to happy hour- ...On our first night here, We came for happy hour with another couple- food was great and service was wonderful given it was a Friday night and they were crowded- The down side would be that it has more of a club atmosphere with people standing around the bar and so loud you can't have a conversation at your table...If you're into a super loud atmosphere and not into conversation you can hear- then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my GFs. I love this place, had chicken with waffles and it was sooo good. Waffle was crispy and I appreciated the fried chicken was a breast pounded to an even thickness and not overly breaded.  Tucked away in an industrial park, this could easily become a locals favorite. Nicely decorated with industrial modern decor, we sat out on the huge patio.  The only reason I subtracted 1 star, our waitress was not very attentive and a little on the rude side."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and friendly staff!!! The chicken fried chicken is a must!! Soooooo good! We are visiting from San Diego but would definitely come back if we lived here. They have a full bar so would love a Bloody Mary next time if it's not a work day. Fun and innovative menu options and very fun vibe!"}
{"text":"Where do I start.. first we waited for at least 15 minutes before we had to track someone down to even order any drinks. Then when we started to order our food.. three people in our party ordered the same thing which consisted of biscuit fried chicken with gravy and egg.. they ran out of biscuits and they ran out of gravy but didn't advise anyone they ran out of gravy.. then they added cheese on one when he said he didn't want cheese and added an egg on another.. then they forgot my breakfast sliders along with the side of bacon my fiancé ordered.. And after they said they will Comp four of the meals they ended up adding it on the bill.. and also adding the two meals that were suppose to be replace the two original meals that were taken back and we were told was going to be comped as well was added to The check.. the waitress that helped our waitress was the only good one everyone else was bad.. we will never come back even with the 2 \"$25 gift cards\" they gave us to use for next time..if I could only give them negative 10 stars I will.. I know it's Mother's Day but all the screw ups they had with our table alone one after the other..I also believe the manager could have done more For us but for reason chose not too.. all of us were not satisfied at all with the service and the food..also waiting 1.5 almost 2 hours getting our food didn't help either"}
{"text":"Don't even bother. Let me just start by saying the atmosphere is nice inside. Unfortunately, that is the only positive thing about this place. My husband and I came in with our 1 year old daughter for breakfast on Saturday morning. Our waitress was beyond awful. She spent most of her time chatting it up with one table in particular that looked like it must have been a couple of her friends. Took her 15 minutes to come back to take our order after giving us menus. When she did, she made some comment about being the only waitress which would be an okay excuse if there were more than just three other tables with people. The place was almost empty. At one point she walked over and refilled coffee for the table next to us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted any. She then offered to bring some bananas for my daughter which she never brought. My food came out before my husband's plate by at least 10 minutes. Our waitress came over and mentioned something about our food being on separate tickets which made zero sense. Seemed more likely that she completely forgot to put half of our order in which is insane because there were only two of us ordering. When his food did finally arrive with a measly \"sorry it took so long\", his waffle was all soggy. I ordered the acupulco skillet which said it came with \"cheesy potatoes\". In most places this means cheese on potatoes. Apparently at this place it means drowning in cheese sauce. Disgusting. Food is gross and overpriced and takes forever and service is awful. I regret my one visit and will never go back. Save your money and your time and go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My family ate brunch here on Sunday and it was an incredible experience. Normally I'm not a fan of the \"warehouse\" style buildings but I had no trouble hearing my table conversation and didn't feel like we were shouting. The food - the food was delicious and just the right size portions. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and awesome friendly informative service!  Will definitely be back.  The Bisquits and Gravy, opened faced fried chicken on biscuit sandwich and Belgian waffle were all delicious.  Very hip, modern space yet comfortable and relaxing."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Portions are perfect!  The food is outstanding quality.  I tried brunch yesterday for first time and went back again this morning.  We had the banana Nutella pancake -excellent; the Belgium waffle - perfect; Acapulco scramble - delicious.  High recommendation!"}
{"text":"As trendy and cute as Chandler gets. My mimosa had a refreshing, light orange hue to it on account of them giving me a generous champagne pour-- very impressive. The food was great. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is cool, it's decorated nicely and the outdoor patio is also dog friendly. It's located in between a few hotels and conveniently off the freeway.The food was okay, it wasn't great. What makes my experience so-so was the service. The hostess was super friendly, but as my boyfriend and I waited on the patio we were waiting at least 15 minutes before I had to get up and flag someone down. It was a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. After we had our order taken down I had to flag down another person for the toast that came with my meal. For the third time, I flagged yet another person over to get our bill. We interacted with at least 4 different staff members which was pretty annoying considering half the time we asked for things we had already ordered and nobody checked in to see how our food was/if we needed anything else. We had a gift card and that's why we decided to give this place a try, otherwise we wouldn't have stopped to see what it was about. I wouldn't go back based on how bad the service was especially when the food was far from impressive."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this place is very cool. The location is great, and they have a pretty solid wine list. The reason I'm not writing a 5 star review is because the food I have tried is just ok. We came in for brunch, and I had the French toast. It was a huge portion of deep fried French toast shoved on a little tiny rectangle plate. Don't get me wrong... I'm all for creative plating, but it was a little impractical."}
{"text":"I've had many friends talk about Meridiem opening and how cool it was. My mom and I were looking for a breakfast spot and stopped in yesterday.  The ambiance was so great! There were comfy couches, quaint tables, a beautiful wine cellar and the most incredible chandelier I've seen outside of Vegas over their bar. The food was not only delicious, but well priced! Service was amazing and we can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I just found this gem of a restaurant and I have to say I am so impressed.  The food is amazing and the service is excellent.  My friends and I had HH a few days ago and Lucas took great care of us!  We never had an empty beverage and the food was delicious.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch break with my team and everyone loved it. I ordered the portobello caprese with a house salad and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Pros:    Beautiful Place. They did a great job.  Awesome drinks so far. Killer cherry ice ball manhattan I think it was. Maybe it was an old fashioned.  Some fantastic beers on tap.  Nice bar area.  That's about where it ends.    Cons:    The food.   Calamari - was super plain and tasteless. Having this on the happy hour will hurt them.   Chicken plate - was over cooked and uninspired.  Italian sub - was very plain. Similar to what you'd expect at a grocery store deli maybe.  The owner. Must have walked by a six or seven times it does not say a word. We were the only people in the restaurant. He sat at the bar with 2 laptops  I think when you're just starting a restaurant you should be engaging with customers and keeping a close eye on the kitchen.  The kitchen. Seems to be an afterthought in the design of the restaurant. They have a clear glass so you can see it and it seems like a small assembly line vs a kitchen. Kinda odd.  The staff selection: Now this is nitpicky but is it me or did they completely poach all of the staff from La Sala, Living Room and Rock Lobster to work at this place?"}
{"text":"PROS -Close to our house! -Very modern and spacious -Chill HH we ordered drinks and apps to share between the 3 of us. The Provisoner whites and reds were good -Pretzel fondue had 3 large pretzels and cheesy goodness. Did not really use the side of spicy mustard on the board -Meatballs were seasoned very well -Crab and artichoke was skimpy on the crab but still very tasty and liked the little soft pita bites they were served with  CONS -We couldn't keep up with the different servers we were getting, it was a little spotty throughout the night but just attributed that to the size of our group (7 people)  Will try again!"}
{"text":"Passing through the area and thought I'd give it a shot. Had the filet with garlic spinach and I have to say it was the best around. The staff was beyond nice and it really felt like I wasn't some newcomer but a regular. This is the type of service you are accustomed to in the south and I'm happy to have that same service and good quality so far from home. I plan stopping every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here three times to eat and once for happy hour. I do not care for the food, to me it tastes like pre-packaged garbage. Happy hour seems to draw in a lot of people from the local businesses and the ambiance is cool. Not a place I would visit on my own but it's good for groups."}
{"text":"Awesome environment and great food! Great vibe for a weeknight quick bite or a fun weekend out. The grilled chicken breast dish is great if trying to be healthy or the burger or BLT or bruschetta if you don't mind some calories! All the cocktails are so great, try one of each!"}
{"text":"I guess I have to say this is a new to go stop for me! I love love the ambiance and why I am always going back! JR sucks cause they have really raised there prices! But try the grilled cheese and the little appetizer plates! See Shal at the bar! They are working on the services but go sit at the bar or outside and enjoy the amazing arizona weather"}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch place in Chandler. Nice decor and a DJ in the morning. The concrete and glass make for a louder dining experience that adds to somewhat of a party atmosphere. The biscuits and gravy I ordered the first time I went were amazing but there was not enough of them compared to other dishes i saw coming out. There could have been 1 or 2 more biscuits on the plate."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Love the ambiance- wish the service was quicker.  Will continue to come here for the fun atmosphere, music is great!  Always a good time!"}
{"text":"Pancakes were FABULOUS! Service was good, and ambiance was trendy giving off a \"Scottsdale\" vibe. However, the echoes were loud which made hearing conversation at the table difficult.   Bazaar begging - arrived at restaurant and was told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After walking past the hostess table we discover about four to five open table were available during the time we were asked to wait. Our party of 3 was asked to sit at the end of a high top table that was actually for a party 8. We were confused on why we're asked to wait with so many open tables available and at such a large table?"}
{"text":"This place was okay nothing special for brunch. The menu was very sparse and didn't have allot to choose from. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with poached eggs. When I received my order I got two biscuits and not much gravy and no eggs I had to ask my waiter isn't this supposed to have eggs with it and my daughter ordered the same thing and no eggs. He said he would look into it and about 10 minutes later he brought out the eggs. I would think with a menu with not many choices you would know what the order should look like. I will say the food was good when I finally received what I ordered. Maybe dinner has more choices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Just what Chandler needed. Great food, drinks and Ryan the owner is awesome and made us feel very welcome. Highly Recommend. We had the bruschetta and it was perfect.."}
{"text":"Came here last night. We tried the toasts-peach, ribeye and heirloom. All were delicious. Our server Cade was great and attentive! I will agree with some of the other patrons, music was a bit loud, maybe dj should turn down highs just a bit. That was my only downside, still not enough to drop any stars. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"So I discovered this place one day after work when I needed a drank!  I support a site 5 mins away and was looking for a cool spot.  This place is also great for lunch as it's not crowded!  A bit surprising as there are several business close by.  It's easy to miss is you're not paying attention as the bank across the street has a similar color scheme.  Fries are tasty plus lots of lighter, healthier options."}
{"text":"My husband and I are foodies and love dining out several times per week. He works near Meridiem and told me about the opening. When we were looking for a nearby breakfast spot, Yelp here said it was #3 so we figured we'd give it a try. The decor, as many have mentioned, is nice. It's young & trendy and feels like a classy place. There was a dj playing music that, honestly, didn't bother me but really would be more fitting for the evening. We placed our order and got some coffee. Then we waited. And waited. A half hour later, the server finally said she was going back to check on the food after apologizing twice for the wait. I ordered a Benedict of sorts with bacon, avacado, and tomato. Potatoes had to be ordered separately. My husband ordered a skillet with eggs on top. I ate one side of the bene and noticed the eggs were very undercooked and underseasoned. I mentioned this to her and they did comp my order and the coffees since we waited and I could only eat half my meal. If it wasn't $16 for breakfast, I might not have been as disappointed, but I felt like I had higher expectations, considering the prices. Again, the service was good and we appreciate when something goes wrong and they take responsibility and try to make it right. Because of this, I'd consider going back for drinks and apps in the evening. The patio looks nice. I just wouldn't return for food again unless I heard the kitchen had gotten much better. I wish them luck but it's not looking promising at this point."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast one morning as they were getting ready for a private event few hours later. Since all the morning staffs were in a meeting, they were short staffs and it took us a while to receive any attention / services. After their meeting was over half an hour later, the general manager did stop by to check up on us which completely made up for the lack of services when we first walked in.   I ordered a traditional breakfast and it was delicious. Even though it was located right by a main road, you really could not hear much of the traffic while sitting outside. I enjoyed having breakfast here and will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I come to this place for happy hour all the time and the service at the Bar is always amazing but today, mother's day, my sister made a reservation for 12pm, we got there at 1150 and were told it was going to be 30 min to 1 hr wait. We went back up and was told that at 1215 that our table was just about ready. Went back up there at 1220 and was told that our table was given to someone else and that we would have to wait another 30 min to 1 hr for another table. That was absolutely unprofessional of them. You know it's sad when you are waiting outside and people that are leaving are saying good luck."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem... Excellent food and beverages, as well as rustic chic ambiance perfect for any gathering. Highly recommend!!!"}
