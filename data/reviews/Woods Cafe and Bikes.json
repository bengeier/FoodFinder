{"text":"A wonderfully sweet couple own this unique little shop. Their attention to detail was apparent in the decor, great customer service and delicious food. It's located in a great place too. After walking or biking you can stop in and get a smoothie made from real fruit. My daughter had the strawberry one and she said it was delicious.  I couldn't believe the prices too. My husband and I had freshly made sandwiches, my daughter had her smoothie,  and the dogs shared the vanilla ice cream from the Klondike bar, all for 17.00.  Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably friendly owners contribute to this new and welcoming bike/cafe in South Park. The service is quick and the deli style food is delicious.   You can sit at the counter or relax in some comfortable chairs.   They offer smoothies, coffee, sandwiches and frozen treats.   They have bike rentals by the hour or the day, and they offer inexpensive cruisers for the road, hybrids, as well as higher end mountain bikes with suspension."}
{"text":"The people there are super nice and go out of their way for you. My wife and I had smoothies and they were amazing! They cost 5-6 bucks a piece but they give you a lot and the fruit in them seems very fresh. The interior is very nice and the place appears to be super clean. It seems like the perfect place to grab some snacks before or after a walk/bike ride in the park."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to rent bikes. It's right along the trails so easy access. The owners are lovey and so so helpful. He went as far as to set up an obstacle course with some cones and wood for my son who was struggling to ride. So sweet. They have carriages to hook on the back for a toddler which is a plus for me. He is really thorough to make sure you have the right size bike, makes adjustments, and asks if it's ok before you go. Just super considerate and genuine.  The cafe is the perfect place to grab a snack after your tiring ride also. I love this place!"}
{"text":"My son has been craving smoothies for about a week and I thought we'd give it a try.  Great concept, nice people and fantastic smoothies.  I can't wait to come back again to make a day out of it with a bike rental and a panini!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to come here after it never being open on my morning rides. My friend wanted to ride Bikes and asked if I knew anywhere and this was the first place to come to mind. I mentioned to her there only $5 bucks down there I think so we all rolled over. On entering the lady was busy in the kitchen prepping food it seemed so there was no greeting on entering. But once she heard us talking she was super friendly and told us all about the bikes. We asked about the $5 Dollar bikes and she said there $8 for a basic pavement bike not that a few bucks matter but it's misleading. I thought it was cool that you could rent full suspension bikes for the whole day around $45 bucks and take them to other parks. I'm also a big fan of giant brand bikes so that was a plus for the shop. A few things to mention tho for the shop is where's the community tool area for someone to fix there own bike or make adjustments outside the shop? That's always nice to have when places to that being if your in a pinch or forget your tools. They did have a few tools and other bicycle products but not a wide selection at all just the bare basics. I haven't tried the food but the menu looked decent I just wish they had more hot food maybe burgers or something as I'm not a big fan of cold cuts. The inside it's self was nice and lots of room for seating and it was definitely kept clean. Overall the place is nice, convenient and friendly staff if your at the park later in the day but if you here early in the morning come prepared with snacks, drinks, or multi tool cause they don't open till 11."}
