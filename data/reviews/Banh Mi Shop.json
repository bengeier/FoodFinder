{"text":"It's a very very very small location. It used to be a photo store. It's a super quick window take out. Barely any room to dine in. You go to the window and pick it up. Very cheap! Really good! Also the filling is hot unlike most banh mi places in toronto where it's cold."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent place with extremely cheap prices. I got a roasted pork sandwich with a good Vietnamese iced coffee for $3.70! As someone else noted, the bread is extremely crumbly but overall quite tasty, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"So slowwwwwwwww... 
Food is good, but too often sold out of mango. 
The wait (no line) has grown old, painfully slow service."}
{"text":"No longer in business! :( Replaced by a Chinese food place that doesn't do lemongrass chicken nearly as well."}
{"text":"So the local Mom & Pop Grab n' Go shop (Juicy Fresh EMC) has now been retired and replaced by Banh Mi Shop. While I'll miss the old place, this metro corner is in desperate need of being infused with better affordable lunch food. This shop is the 3rd new food place to open up in this area (along with an oven baked pizza place and sushi shop), and is now officially the cheapest place to grab lunch in the area.

For $3.70 (including tax) I got the grilled pork sandwich with a can of coke. The sandwich was a decent size (though not as big as Banh Mi Boys) and was fairly decent. I will warn you, it is really crumbly so prepare yourself. I think it would be a bit better if they cut the sandwiches in half  before wrapping them.Crumbly + long sandwich = very unelegant eating experience. The sandwich itself is pretty tasty. It won't blow your mind as the flavors are fresh but not very intense. But when you consider the price, it comes out on top as being a great fresh alternative to most of the places in the area. 

Finally, the service is very friendly and they have a point card system. Buy 8 sandwiches and you get a free one. I love when places do that because it truly encourages me to come back. 

I will definitely come back here soon!
