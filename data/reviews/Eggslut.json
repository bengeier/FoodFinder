{"text":"Get here early and be prepared to wait . It's worth it , different in the sense that it's almost like a fast food spot but better. The line moves along fast with everyone anticipating a chance to eat . Your able to view everything being made which adds to the anticipation . Flavor and fulfilling to the last drop ! Tip bring your own beverages hahahaha . Good to the last drop. Must try"}
{"text":"We ordered the Fairfax which was amazing! Only complaint was that they ran out of Sluts....they should never run out of their signature dish! Definitely recommend standing in line!!! It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Looked on yelp for a good place to eat breakfast and eggslut came up as one of the best places!  And man was it right. I got the Fairfax and added bacon like everyone suggested. The sandwich was on point and tasted great!  The sriracha mayo was great and the bacon was cooked perfect. I will say its a little pricey as the sandwich was $12 bucks and an Orange juice was $5 bucks but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Hate waiting in the long line but I have to say it's well worth it. We have been to the one in LA and the food here at Cosmo it's the same. Tried the \"slut\" this time, if you love mashed potato and poached egg you will love this. It is served with a few slices of baguette bread."}
{"text":"Amazing food .... Tried sandwich on the menu and upgraded of course! The \"fairfax\" came with the softest eggs I've probably ever encountered ... It was paired with cheese ... I added bacon, avavado and arugula .... The only thing that was missing was maybe sum type on potato, to truly make it complete! Line was long maybe 30-45 mins but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Not worth the wait. Does not compare to the original location, and the service is horrible! There were lots of employees standing around doing nothing while twenty people wait in line in front of them patiently waiting ! Nothing irks me more than seeing employees standing around just twiddling their nails! The heck?!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok and interesting.... kinda pricey tho.... eggslut, cheeseburger and a small cold brew coffee was abt $30. I would recommend to get only the eggslut cuz it's different and pretty yummies..... :)"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the WORST eggs I've ever had. No idea how this place stays in business, though I suspect even a horrible restaurant can survive with a lot of Casino foot traffic. 

The eggs are so greasy from them cooking them in way to much oil, and they don't taste good at all. I'm from NY and l love a good fried egg sandwich. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, stay clear of hear. Gave two stars because I like the restaurant name...ya"}
{"text":"From LA to Vegas, it's about time! Most popular items are the Fairfax and The Slut. Fairfax is by far my favorite thing. Lives up to the name, the eggs are light and fluffy and a good amount is on the sandwich. The Slut, however, is pretty small but still really good. Definitely on the pricey side but good if you're a first timer. The place is pretty small so beware of lines and lack of seating but there are chairs and lounges right across. 

P.S. Don't get drinks, the size is too small for the price. I suggest you go to Starbucks if you want a decent sized coffee."}
{"text":"Indigestion on a bun. Service was lacking organization. Lot of work with little out put."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum! Although we waited in line for 40+ minutes, I soon forgot about that when I took the first bite of my egg sandwich. It was fantastic. The flavor combination was to die for. My husband also thoroughly enjoyed his meal as well. We are looking forward to going back to Vegas to have some more!"}
{"text":"Wirklich gute Würzung, ja. Und ordentlicher Kaffee, ja. Und lässiges Lokal, ja. Was aber soll der Hype? Die ewige Schlange? Die betont langsame Abfertigung? 

Solchen Geschmack gibt es in Europa an jeder Ecke. Ohne Anstehen. Aber unter Blinden ist der Einäugige König."}
{"text":"EGGSLUT, VEGAS, The Cosmo, 2nd floor - Here's the deal, Tennille. If you like eggs and there is a line, DO NOT get out of line. Call your Ma, post last night's shananigans on Instagram or check your bank account but do not get out of line. You'll thank me later. 

As a native NYer who has consumed more egg sandwiches than I can count (It's a NY state food group. LOL.), Eggslut's Bacon, Egg and Cheese on brioche is the BEST egg sandwich I've ever had! No joke. Lots of quality well-cooked bacon. No mushy, fatty bacon here! 

My hubs and I wish we ordered 2 egg sandwiches each. Hint. Hint. You'll thank me later. Remember, you don't want to get back in line. Quality coffee. Staff was in great spirits and is a well oiled machine. Good price point for high quality casual dining on the strip.  You're on vacation, right?  We've been to this  glorious city 20 times. Yes, 20 times. We know- we're nuts.  This is one of our new faves!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I love eggs and the sausage, egg and cheese was yummy. The egg perfectly cooked placed within a brioche bun, cheese perfectly melted over the sausage. Not to mention the coffee that came with it was good. At $8 a sandwich, it is a must get."}
{"text":"So worth the wait in line (which went relatively fast considering how long the line was). The GAUCHO and the SLUT were melt in your mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"Simple ingredients but nicely executed.  I had the slut, the egg was cooked perfectly, just right to be the runny goodness it should be.  Served with three slices of baguette with a bit of olive oil.  Was a bit expensive $10.50, but I can see why it's popular"}
{"text":"Ehh. Long line that has you wrapped around into the hallway that is also the restroom. That's kinda gross. 

The food was good but pricey in my opinion. 

If you want coffee or water you'll be out five bucks. Go down the hall to the juice bar and get their \"Living water\" for $1.50. 

The communal tables are kinda gross too because there is such a high turnover of customers that they never seem to get cleaned from customer to customer. You can see the greasy fingerprints all over!

Like I said, the food was good but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had an egglslut and a gaucho... pretty good for brunch but not enough to fill.  Also had to wait in line for 30 minutes-- should've gotten there earlier, oh well!  A good mid morning snack."}
{"text":"You must go.  Just go.  Inexpensive for Vegas egg sandwiches with freshly made everything even the brioche bun it sits on.  The two downsides to this place are the line which can be long yet moves fast and the new pants you will need to buy if you make this place a regular in your rotation."}
{"text":"We passed by this a ton of times and there was never a line.  Finally we decided to try it out on Sunday and it was a half hour long wait to order.  Totallh worth the wait and the price especially if you love eggs and breakfast.  I love biting into the sandwich and having the egg yolk break and soak into your bun.  The bun is key and what does it.  It's like a fresh baked buttery croissant except without the flakiness.  The ratio of all the components is just right.  You get all the goodness of a plate of breakfast in each bite.  Not too greasy, fresh ingredients.  Their menu is simple like in-n-out.  Its just different kinds egg based of sandwiches.

Seating sucked for us on a Sunday afternoon. You have to do that lingering stalking method where you wait around for someone to leave then dive for their table lol. This is not the place to meet a group of ppl for brunch.

Still a good unique eggbased sandwich.  Can't get anything like this anywhere else so I would suffer the long wait again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Tuesday morning around 11am.  The line took about 20 minutes to order.  This ain't in the same league as any McD's breakfast sandwich so put yourself in that mindset when you're shelling $8.50 per sandwich.  I ordered the Fairfax which is overflowing with the most luscious custardy scrambled eggs, probably fortified with cream and/or butter.  They're so unctuous they;ve just barely crossed the line from fully liquid to spoonable curds.   Eggs cooked like this have an intense eggi-ness that makes them a treat rather than mundane.  They also don't fluff up with air like traditional scrambled eggs so I suspect my sandwich actually had 3 or 4 eggs on it to give it volume.  The brioche bun could barely hold my last few bites together so I was shamelessly using my fingertips to scoop up the last curds of scrambled eggs and shoveling them into my mouth.  At these prices, Eggslut should be considered a splurge and a treat and not an everyday  breakfast joint.  With that mindset totally worthy it.  

Other people in my group ordered the sous vide eggs served with toast sticks and bacon egg sandwiches.  Everyne raved about their food.  Hubby sang praises for their thick sliced bacon which was more meaty than the grisly salty stuff at the grocery store.  

Limited seating - basically just one long counter with bar stools so you might want to plan on taking it to go."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast! Ordered the Egg Slut and the Fairfax (added bacon and avocado).  Ate their twice and would have gone back again if we did not have time constraint. While the bill can add up when adding OJ and Coffee's... but what do you expect and darn worth it ! The quality of ingredients shine through."}
{"text":"Not a good place to eat at. Overpriced processed menu items. Eat at your leisure if you dare!"}
{"text":"I would basically give this place a 3.5 it's great but there is a lot of hype behind this place and I did wait for a long time for a sandwich. I had the fairfax sand which was awesome but these breakfast sandwich scan add up real fast because it's $4 bucks just for bacon but it's the Vegas strip so what do you expect. 

The menu at eggslut is relatively small but sometime simple is good. The add on item for this place are basically bacon and avocado not sure how much added avocado is. I did get the salted Carmel chocolate cookie which was awesome I'm just not sure why they heated it up 5mins and let it sit on the counter way before my sandwich was done. 

The only thing I hope to see in the future is maybe the pace picks up around here because it does take forever to get your sandwich and I think it could be faster! Overall good experience but I'm going to wait awhile before I come back."}
{"text":"It was OK, but I don't see the big attraction. It's an egg sandwich. I make one every morning at home and don't have to wait in a long line for it. IF I came upon it with no line I might order again. I would definitely have them hold off on their ketchup based sauce, I can still taste that and didn't like."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but fast food breakfast is not worth a 45 to 60 minute wait in line

Stood in line for about 25 minutes and never got within sight of the cashier before walking away.  I thought no I moved six spots during this time 

Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I'm a regular in Vegas so when I'm in town, the Eggslut has been my must stop for breakfast location!  If there's a line, wait in line! It's worth the wait!!  My favorite is the fairfax (add avocado) but my last time there I was with a friend and we split that and the Slut.  Holy egg-asm it was yummy!  The cookie is so so...tasted like a warm chocolate cookie.  But the soft scrambled egg in the fairfax is divine!! I'm dreaming of another bite now!"}
{"text":"Soooooo I'm giving this place three stars because of the name.... The food was okay but for 20 dollars it all fell apart and  I could only eat half of what I bought. My husband gives it 2 stars."}
{"text":"Go go go and get yourself a tasty snack after a night of drinking!  I am in LA and had it before, but this was even better!! 

I got the fairfax and added pickles :)"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Cosmo and needed a place to have a quick bite to eat.  My wife really enjoyed it, she ate there twice. She had the Fairfax and the egg salad sandwich. I had the Gaucho.  The sandwiches are very good and the brioche bun it comes with is excellent.  The line can be VERY long during peak hours so keep that in mind when you decide to go. Seating can be difficult but you can get it to go and find a place nearby to sit and eat."}
{"text":"This has good food but I think it's a bit overrated. If you are going to stand in line for 20 to 30 minutes I suggest ordering the slut. It is their specialty. The biscuit is mediocre. I am sure there are better places to eat in Las Vegas. This is not a bad place I just think it's overrated and overpriced  for the long line and minimal seating."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the wait was ridiculous. It was about 25 minutes in line and then 2 to get my order. The cashier was the obvious bottleneck since the grill seemed to waiting on orders. I suspect they designed the line to look busy. I would give it another chance based on the food."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best bacon, egg, and cheeses I have ever. The brioche was the perfect choice to contain this awesome sandwhich. Line was long the two times I went but moved quickly."}
{"text":"Really great place to get breakfast egg sandwiches.  They do scrambled eggs right.  We got two fairfax sandwiches.  One with turkey sausage and other with avocado.  Everything from the eggs to spicy mayo to the fresh burger buns is executed to perfection and brought together in perfect harmony.  Definitely recommend this place.  Only downside is the line can be long, but I assure you it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I got the Fairfax with turkey sausage at an extra cost of $3. Typically their eggs are scrambled soft but I asked for mine to be scrambled hard. My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday morning around 8:30am. The lines were long but as someone mentioned, they move rather quickly. The staff was extremely pleasant and the Fairfax was soo tasty *cue drooling*"}
{"text":"This place is total hype.  I was severely disappointed!  Walked by about a year ago as they were getting ready to open for business, and finally got to go in last week on a return trip.  

Visited Monday, 12/18/17 at 11:30.  The line was wrapped around the corner down to the restrooms, it was crazy.  We jumped in line anyways, and considered abandoning ship - it definitely was a SLOW moving line.  We waited almost 30 minutes.  Eventually got to order; there was one person taking orders (this was on a Monday), and it was quite chaotic. The three of us ordered and paid separately.  I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich.  

The service was SUPER SLOW.  I could see they had pans full of precooked eggs, sausage, bacon and the lot...  All they had to do was slap it together!  But they just weren't cranking it out very quickly.  The guy that ordered right before me got his out in about 5 minutes.  The other two were bloody slow... Nearly 15 minutes after ordering; or 10 minutes after the guy right in front of us got his.  Not sure what the issue was, but everything was out of sorts.  Now almost **45 minutes** in, I was just happy to have a sandwich!!  Oh and the girl barking names out...  Pretty sure...  No, certain, that she hated her job.  She dgaf about anything, period.  

My sandwich (again, sausage/egg/cheese) was insanely disappointing.  The brioche bun lacked any character other than \"bland.\"  The turkey sausage had potential, but likewise was bland.  The egg was super runny, which I am NOT okay with.  The cheese...  Not even melted, like it was just slapped on top of cooled ingredients.  Overall, a super disappointing experience. 45 minutes for a sandwich that was just short of \"gross\" (I'll take bland over gross) was in no way worth it.  

Last comment...  the \"fresh\" OJ that was $5 for about a 12-14 oz portion was definitely not fresh tasting.  Perhaps it was fresh squeezed, but if so, the oranges that were used were anything but fresh.  

Blech.  Not even sure why I'm giving two stars...  I guess because I waited so long, I didn't want it to be a total loss.  Enjoy the hype, but this place is definitely not for me."}
{"text":"I had the sausage egg and cheese sandwich. The bun was the best part of the sandwich. The egg was an egg and the turkey sausage was extremely bland in my opinion. Definitely not worth all the hype and long lines. Once I finished it my stomach hurt and felt terrible the rest of the day. It did not agree with me and the thought of it still makes me sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"EggSlut is totally delicious and worth the  wait. I'm encouraging you to self indulge in the well known \"Slut\" (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette). Try me you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Shorter line than the one in LA, service is great and the food came out perfect! It's definitely a different feel eating in Las Vegas. I got the \"slut.\" Ask for extra slices of bread, and they will happily give them to you."}
{"text":"We had the Gaucho steak and egg sandwich and the bacon, egg, and cheese. Delicious. There was a large amount of thick-sliced, very tender steak, plus nice cilantro flavor in the chimichurri sauce. The BEC had a huge amount of bacon. Buns were buttery. Eggs perfectly runny. Only waited 10-15 mins at 8:30 on a Thursday. Great brekkie but wouldn't want to wait much more than that. Found two seats."}
{"text":"No service, long wait, no seating... First of all the line was wrapped around the building of probably tourists that liked the cheeky name.  It's not worth the wait.  Drinks/food are overpriced and no seating at all at the venue, like 10 bar chairs and a strip of bar.  We ordered and asked for a OJ.  The guys said they were out... Ok, so we get a can soda instead.  He sets it on the counter and there's black stuff all in the rim of it.  We give it back to him, by this time he's on the phone and gestures for us to give it back and hands us a new one.  Next minute someone brings a tray of OJ.  We asked if we could change the soda for OJ.  We never opened the can.  He says \"nah, that'll mess up the numbers so. We count for everything.\"  Ok.  Have you heard of returning?  For your mistake?  They also have the audacity to have a TIP jar at the register.  For what service?!   The food was mediocre.   And if you don't want your eggs or burger medium, too bad.  It's undercooked.  They don't even ask.  The service was terrible.  And the tables were dirty and under serviced (no napkins, no salt, nothing...). Our bill was about $30.  I would say spend your $30 elsewhere.  They have some work to do here."}
{"text":"Probably the two best breakfast egg sandwiches I ever had! I had the pleasure of eating the Bacon, egg & cheese and the Fairfax with turkey sausage sandwich. 

I really enjoyed Eggslut. It was my first time trying this place out. There are no Eggslut's out in the East Coast, so I definitely had to give it a try while I was in Vegas. But beware, the line is extremely long especially in the morning."}
{"text":"good stuff for less than typical vegas prices.  im not a huge fan of vegas so this place was a breath of fresh air. i had the fairfax.  i would plan to grab one and go eat it somewhere outside though. its sorta dark in the cosmo."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the most unbelievable breakfast restaurants. We got there and were very reluctant because we saw a bunch of breakfast sandwiches but we were blown away by how fast, how tasty, and how it truly felt like a home cooked meal .  Would absolutely definitely recommend this place. This is a must try"}
{"text":"If you love eggs and burgers this is the place to go. Totally worth every cent. I love how there is a salad substitute for the buns. I got the fairfax sandwich with avocado and bacon and I ate every inch of it. This is probably my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Delicious, interesting egg concoctions in a high energy open kitchen. Only knock on this place is that the food is sorta messy (drippy / crumbly goodness) but seating is limited. Oh and don't get a salad version of anything, the brioche is TO. DIE. FOR."}
{"text":"I would stick to the sandwiches 

The line not worth it

The price somewhat reasonable 

The \"Slut\" was different I would say try it for yourself but The \"Slut\" was a Slut it's a trap! She just gonna take you're money! Like a real Slut!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and wait in line here for breakfast no matter how hungover you are.  You need The Slut in your life. It's basically a poached egg on a pile of creamy mashed potatoes but more amazing than anyone can describe. Do it!"}
{"text":"Holy mackerel, this is a good place. Maybe one of the smallest menus and one of the smallest seating areas in Vegas, but the food is fantastic. Get there early, before the crowds arrive after 8:00am. We had the Fairfax Sandwich w/spicy turkey sausage and it was incredible. Perfectly soft scrambled eggs, cheese a fresh bun. No lunch needed that day."}
{"text":"This place had a long line but it moved like clockwork. It did cost us as much as dinner the night before $40 BUT it was worth it. It was so good and filling. The eggs fluffy and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gaucho Sandwich(amazing) and Slut* Specialty(average) with fresh squeezed OJ(). The Sandwich was the best seller. This place is on the pricey side but it is well worth it. Line was long when I went in the afternoon but it went by very quickly. I heard mornings have ridiculous lines so don't go if you're starving unless you're willing to wait for a bit."}
{"text":"I went at 7 am on a Sun (east coast jet lag) and there was no line. (Club goers had already cut out I guess?) got the slut and a cold brew. Counter staff were friendly & efficient.

The slut is fine but I wouldn't get it again. It was well executed - runny egg, smooth potato purée - but the flavors are overall very mild. I'd hoped for a more flavorful yolk-y taste, as one gets from farm fresh eggs. So, it's fine, glad I tried it but not again. And very glad I didn't wait in a long line to try it."}
{"text":"Worth checking out if staying in the City Center area. We came at about 8:15 on a Sunday morning and waited about 15 minutes. We tried the Gaucho and the SEC. SEC was good, solid fare with honey mustard aioli. Gaucho had a nice chimichurri sauce and quality tri-tip wagyu. Advice: remove from the paper even if you feel inclined not to. It's pretty slippery and I had finished the top bun by accident about halfway through. Their brioche buns are delicious. No real sides available, but nice, strong coffee. Overall, recommend, but wouldn't wait in a crazy line for it."}
{"text":"Great name for a breakfast spot, but their food was mediocre. I had the bacon egg and cheese and it was just alright. The brioche bun was too thick and hard. I wanted to get the Slut, but I saw they serve it in a glass baby food jar. That's not gonna help cure hanger! The prices just didn't match their quality. I had higher hopes for Eggslut."}
{"text":"Ordered two egg, cheese and bacon breakfast sandwiches because they looked real good. Boy, were we disappointed. They put lots of bacon on it, but you can't taste anything beyond the gallon of ketchup they pile on. Both my wife and I agreed it was a 2 or 3 out of 10. The $8 price each was reasonable for the Strip, but a waste of $ in this case. Maybe the other menu items were better. Let's hope."}
{"text":"Food 3/5
Atmosphere 4/5
Service 3/4

The food was good enough. Id suggest the 'Slut' it's pretty tasty, and kinda unique. The street food vibe was really working in that place, it was modern yet quaint. 

One thing that annoyed me though was how slow the food was prepared. I waited 20 minutes for my food in an 'Order then sit' kind of place. Maybe I was in a hurry but shouldn't it be an in and out type of deal?"}
{"text":"Shockingly delicious. We read reviews and heard it was good but were unsure what to really expect. Walked up and it's more like a stand with a small menu and pricey items. It turned out to be the best meal we had the entire trip! He got the cheese burger with bacon and avocado which left him in awe. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese which was also delicious. To top them off we got the biscuits which were surprisingly just as yummy. This place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday morning you have to wait in a 15-20 minute line just to order. I'm not complaining about that because typically that means the food is good. I ordered the Fairfax with bacon and avocado. It was good, I especially enjoyed the spice from the chipotle aioli sauce. My only gripe would be paying $15 for the breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Eggslut but I think it is over priced and over hyped for what they serve, and each time I ordered something it was very salty. The concept, presentation of the food is simple. If you tend on eating there you might as well take it to go. There is very limited seating."}
{"text":"What can I say. Eggs were fantastic! My husband needed 2 sandwiches. I do not recall which I ordered, but we had a total of 3 flavors between the two of us. In a setting where you dine next to the largest, most expensive chandelier in the World. Top notch."}
{"text":"I had the sausage, egg, and cheese with salad instead of a bun. The sausage was not cooked long enough. The egg was cooked sunny side up, and ran into my salad. The salad was OK, but the dressing was overwhelmingly tart. Worst of all, the prices were to steep, even for Las Vegas. I will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. Employees were super friendly, had menus on the wall while you were in line to decide, line took about 10 minutes but worth the wait. I got a gauncho I think it's spelt & my wife the simple Bacon Egg bagel. It was super good. I love breakfast sandwiches and wanted to go out of the normal bagel sandwich. I'm not a fan of spicy food...this one had a small kick to it but it was definitely doable and delicious. My wife's bagel had ketchup on it which was weird but worked perfectly with the sandwich. Food was prepared rather quickly and neatly. I think price wise everything was reasonable except for the OJ. Don't get me wrong, the OJ was delicious, tasted like I sincerely bit into a orange but $5 dollars for a dinky cup. Probably smaller or close to a 16oz cup. But hey whatever food was delicious!"}
{"text":"i had breakfast here because i love the cosmopolitan and after my experience at rose rabbit lie i was down to tray some other restaurants  form the hotel!

it is pretty good i would say, the only reason is that im not sure if they are understaffed or not but the line for breakfast is huge!!
i mean is worth the wait but that kind of sucks lol!
try it awesome for a breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich, but worth a 30-40 minutes wait? Not in my opinion. I went early one morning and snagged one in 5. Brioche was great, egg cooked perfectly (just runny enough), ample applewood smoked bacon."}
{"text":"Woke up this am at the Cosmo and had passed by ES a few times during my stay and thought why not. Rolled in about 7:30 am to the music pounding. Ordered an egg salad sammitch. It was good as hell. Freshly made and tasted homemade. Had some aioli and arugula on it which was perfect. The bad- my can o Sprite cost 5.00. Vegas, baby! Would try this place again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, but the parking and lines are horrible..I don't think I would go thru that again just for a breakfast sandwich.  I wish they were not located in a hotel."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Definitely not worth the wait. Really enjoyed the biscuits though. Biscuit Bitch in Seattle is definitely better. I also think that that the sandwiches should be on the biscuits versus a bun. One thing I did enjoy was the fresh orange juice."}
{"text":"The Slut is by far the most unassuming and amazing tasting item I've had so far in Vegas! Wow! Please bring this establishment to Boston sooner than later"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Vegas we decided to check this place out after we saw all of the good reviews. When we got there the line was pretty long but I didn't want to start over and pick somewhere else to eat so we just decided to stick it out. Good thing we did. The line moved very fast. I want to say we were in line 10-15 minutes tops. My husband and I ordered the bacon , egg and cheese sandwich and an orange juice. As simple as that sounds it was delicious. I was so happy we got to try this place. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If I could evaluate service and flavor separate service would have received 5 stars and food only 3.  Everyone at egg slut was extremely helpful and very accommodating for all my needs going as far to make a special dish for me! But the flavor was lacking for me but that is personal preference."}
{"text":"5 days in vegas ate at the eggslut 3 times - kept going back - simple and good!  loved it!"}
{"text":"Fairfax add avo is amazing .. The salted chocolate  was delicious too ! Will be venturing to the strip again for eggslut !"}
{"text":"We didn't get to try Eggslut in LA so we were happy there was this recently opened location in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  The line was long around breakfast time and took about 30 minutes but it was definitely worth it.  We ordered their signature dish the Slut and one of their breakfast sandwiches the Fairfax.  The Slut came in a little glass cup and about 4-5 pieces of bread and was very tasty and unique.  The portion for the Slut was on the smaller side and it might not be enough food for some folks as a standalone dish.  The Fairfax was filling and came with scrambled eggs, cheese and sriracha mayo on a soft brioche bun.  Both awesome choices and we could definitely see ourselves coming her regularly if we lived near one of their locations.  It's also conveniently located across from Cosmo's Marquee night club and open late for those club go-ers.  We were so inspired by their Slut dish that we even tried to make it once we got back home with mixed results."}
{"text":"Solid egg sandwiches.  Looking for breakfast or lunch or both, Eggslut is worth your consideration"}
{"text":"So good ! there was a line when i got there and i was a little sketch like there is no way the food is that good that there would club line outside. The food was fresh and cooked in a timely manner.Although its just a sandwhich it was super filling, fresh squeezed orange juice too perfect place to kick off your morning"}
{"text":"To. Die. For. Loved this place! Wish I was eating one right now! Egg sandwich was fabulous as was the fresh squeezed juice."}
{"text":"Fantastic Egg, Bacon and Cheese Sandwich.  Had one for dinner and it hit the spot. But they close at 7pm so be sure to get there in plenty of time."}
{"text":"First time I tried Eggslut was at the Los Angeles location. Their sandwiches just melt in your mouth. Everything is cooked just right. I like how the brioche bread is soft and buttered. I got really excited when I yelped restaurants in Las Vegas and saw Eggslut at the Cosmo. 
I took my husband and kids there on a Tuesday close to noontime. The line was not as long as people say it is. We waited for at least 20 mins. Line was slow because there was only 1 girl working the register. 
I don't know what was going on. I don't know how the orders go to the cooks. She was writing stuff a paper bag. I don't know how hard it is to take an order there. Their menu is so limited. I don't know if she was new. She just seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. 
We got to the register and the girl switched places with another worker which was male. My husband clearly ordered 2 Fairfax sandwiches both with bacon and other stuff. 
When they called our order, one of the sandwiches didn't have bacon.  My husband went back and told them there wasn't any bacon in it. The man behind the counter said that we ordered a double order of bacon on one of the Fairfax. Anyway they were nice enough to just put bacon in it. 
For sure they messed up the order because they blast the music so loud there you need to yell out your order to the worker. Another complaint is that there are not too many tables or seats. Just one long table with 7-8 seats on both sides. Just be ready to stand neat. We got lucky and I had my kids sit to save us seats. 
Other than that, I love that place and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Place is right of the elevator from parking spot and it is what it's called Eggslut. Delicious but yet messy be ready to get messy don't get so confident with the sandwich. My wife child and myself got all egged up messy. But definitely a good breakfast sandwich it could be amazing or fabulous except for the messy part."}
{"text":"I got the Fairfax with turkey sausage.  It was pretty good, and I love that they use a brioche bun instead of a regular biscuit that would just fall apart.  Service was excellent as well.  This gets a 4 Star only because it was quite as AMAZING as people make it out to be, the food was good but average good."}
{"text":"The wait-line looked daunting but it moved fast.  I ordered The Slut, which was tasty and satisfying, although a little on the light side; order a side if you're famished.  My companion ordered The Gaucho, \"best breakfast sandwich (he) ever (had)\" he said.  Maybe more drink selection and seating, but overall a great place, great food.  Be an Eggslut!"}
{"text":"Whether in Los Angeles or Las Vegas, Eggslut is one of those places that you HAVE to stop at! 

This was actually the first time I had stopped by the Vegas location, but just like LA the line was no joke!  Fortunately it moves rather quickly and they get your food to you pretty fast once you order.  I have tried most of their menu(not too many options) and have never been disappointed. My favorite by far is the \"Bacon, Egg & Cheese,\" with or without avocado it is amazing, and they are super generous with the bacon! 

The one item on the menu that I have yet to try is the \"Slut,\" I have no idea why but based on all these reviews I will have to try it next time around."}
{"text":"Not worth it!!!! After getting there at 11am there was  40 min wait!! So I figured this has to be a delicious sandwich, however I was wrong!! After I ordered a bacon sandwich and turkey sausage sandwich, it totalled up to almost $19, once I went to the pick up counter I waited 10 min while people received thier order before me that were behind me in line. The lady said I dont know what happened, I received no apology!!!! I finally get the sandwiches, and it tastes like a upgraded McDonald's sandwich, I definitely can make a better one. Was it edible? Yes, its only worth $5, with a ten min wait. Do yourself a favor somewhere else like the pizza place on 3rd floor."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to get a tasty breakfast sammie in the morning. It's always nice to eat SLUTS for breakfast. I had a bacon, egg and cheese and it was yummy."}
{"text":"Definitely a great egg sandwich, but THAT's ALL - just an overpriced egg sandwich.  Not really enough for a full meal. You need about 1 1/2 or 2.  Very small simple menu. Could use some sort of potato side dish to accompany the sandwich. The cheese/butter sauce is a bit weird and greasy. The meat on the tri tip sandwich was marinated which was also weird on an egg sandwich.  If you're in a rush and want to pay too much then go ahead."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place. I'm from Jersey and LOVE me some breakfast sandwiches. Man, was I disappointed. I ordered the turkey sausage egg n cheese. I certainly wasn't anticipating such an incredibly dry bun. Nasty. And I came abt 10 minutes after they opened.  Clearly they were day old. And if not - they need to get a new bakery now. The sausage was perhaps the thinnest sausage patty I've ever seen. For $9.....come on."}
{"text":"Consistency is key, and they are on point for service and taste every time we come here- i love the slut but have had the fair fax sandwich and the short ribs too and those are just as delish!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Staff was friendly and fast. The eggslut is amazing!! We also got the fairfax sandwich and it wasn't too spicy, just enough."}
{"text":"The bad: long lines for a breakfast sandwich, the price for a simple breakfast sandwich, and lack of seating.
The good: the egg, sausage, and cheese breakfast sandwich in a nicely toasted bun.  I'd have to admit it was one of the tastier breakfast sandwiches I've had."}
{"text":"Downstairs from the Boulevard Tower is \"Eggslut\" which is a little shop with a long line and serves breakfast sandwiches that will make other breakfast sandwiches look really bad. Price is decent for Something on the strip at about $10 each. Would definitely go back however go after 3 pm when there's no line."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Omlets are huge and gravy is fantastic. Definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"We liked Eggslut so much we got it twice for breakfast on our 3 day Vegas vacation. We were staying at the Cosmo and the line was so long every time we walked by, that we ended up getting up early both days so we could be in line around 7am. It's a pretty inexpensive breakfast for eating on the strip and we were able to try both the sausage breakfast sandwich and the Fairfax + sausage. We also got a biscuit one day to share and we both really enjoyed that with the maple syrup.

My only complaint is that they use turkey sausage, great health wise but it always seemed to be a little dry. Also my husband wasn't a huge fan of the coffee, he said the roast was darker than he liked. We both loved the orange juice, and while $5 for 12 ounces of orange juice seems a little on the high side, I only wished they sold it in a larger cup!!"}
{"text":"I never was a fan of breakfast sandwiches until I ate at Eggslut!

FOOD: The Slut is a egg and potato puree dip with slices of bread. I honestly love it more than I thought I would. Their egg sandwiches are to die for because the egg literally melts in your mouth. I like to get my sandwiches with cheese and bacon! 

DRINK: They don't give out water cups, but you can buy their amazing fresh orange juice!

ATMOSPHERE: I absolutely love anything that The Cosmopolitan has to offer. It is great that they decided to have Eggslut in their casino. It is open at midnight on weekends and makes a perfect quick meal when you're out late. There is only high-top bar seating here and they run out of seats quickly so you can expect to stand and eat sometimes. The staff is always upbeat and kind. The chefs are extremely great at their jobs and I never see them make a sandwich without a smile on their face :)"}
{"text":"EGG SLUT! You're my SLUT! Located in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Came here after a night of partying and definitely didn't disappoint! There was a bit of a wait around 7am on a Sunday morning. Opted for the cheeseburger this time around with that delicious, runny egg dripping all over the place! Took it upstairs to my room and enjoyed it on the balcony overlooking the view of the strip! Definitely will be back to try more options when I'm in the hood!"}
{"text":"Got the bacon, the sausage, and a slut. This places pretty cool, and the slut is a must try. But given the name of this place, I was expecting bigger, thicker eggs. The slut was cool, but there needs to be more eggs and less potato purée.

Nonetheless, the general experience was nice. Although I do diss the fact that they sell 5 bucks for a small soda, which costs a dollar something in general. So I'm gonna stick with water, which is free from the bar two steps from Eggslut."}
{"text":"The wait was only about 15min at noon on a Friday. I would probably go back. Friendly service, too. I ordered two egg sandwiches and thought they were very good (I had the scrambled egg one and my husband had the over easy egg one with bacon). Kind of wish I'd tried the egg slut in the jar. Next time!?"}
{"text":"Oh man oh man.. who came up with the name eggslut.. cause it's just the place to be when getting your egg cravings satisfied! First impression.. what a long line to see just to grab something hearty to eat such as the Fairfax and the slut (cool name btw)

I have to say there is limited seating unless you want to eat at the bar kinda if it's closed cause  many people were sitting there or the couches as well!

I will come back and to me I believe waiting in this line is worth it to me cause you will satisfy your craving for them eggs"}
{"text":"Great late night spot in the cosmo.  Can't go wrong with an egg slut or sandwich. If you are staying in a the hotel then I recommend getting to go and eating on your bed."}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwich but in my opinion, not worth the price. If you ever had a New York City deli breakfast sandwiches, eggslut is like that but a more fancier gourmet version with brioche buns. This is good to try since there's such a hype for them but I don't think I would get it again because it's too expensive for eggs. Yes they are cage free but they shouldn't cost that much."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Eggslut even though they have an location in Los Angeles. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan so it was the perfect place to go after a long night. The wait took forever for a burger. The burgers were good but not amazing like I expected because of long line. I just got a classic burger with a egg on it. I do not think I will Go to their location in my home town. I have had juicier burgers at a lesser price."}
{"text":"Long line - food was better than regular breakfast sandwiches.  I would go back but it may be quicker to order room service."}
{"text":"Service was nice enough. Everything felt very shopping mall like but the \"Gaucho\" (tri-tip sandwich) was pretty satisfying. It hit the spot. I also got \"The Slut\" which actually blew my mind, but I was surprised with how small it was. Be sure to not expect to get the Gaucho as a meaI. More like a great appetizer. I asked them what the most popular item was, and they highly recommended the  Bacon egg and cheese which turned out to be The most mediocre meal of the three I ordered. Overall, most of the meal was delicious, but I thought the portions were small.  Spent about $36 not including tip."}
{"text":"Worth the hype and worth a wait. Line wasn't too bad at 1pm, but they were cooking more sluts. Told it was about a 30 minute wait. So figured it was a good time to head to the chandelier bar for a drink. About 15 minutes later, Marlon came over to the bar to tell us our food was ready. It's great customer service that warms my heart. The egg slut was tasty, but the biscuit with honey butter was out of this world. Thanks eggslut, and thank you Marlon."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since they first opened their spot at Grand Central Market in DTLA. It helps that I love breakfast foods! Plenty filling and the quality has always been consistently amazing. 

I've been here 3 times while visiting Las Vegas for a convention. Tuesday and Wednesday @ 11am theres was no wait but on Sunday there was a line wrapped down the hallway to the restrooms and a wait time of about 40 minutes.

After a late Las Vegas night, an egg, cheese & bacon sandwich and a coffee and I'm brought back to life. And as I've said the quality is always consistent. I've even seen the cook throw away an egg that was overcooked and not runny in the middle as it should be.

Best breakfast spot in Vegas, worth the trek from other hotels and worth the wait."}
{"text":"There is a line, but it moves fast, and it's deserved... they do a few things very well. It's expensive ( they seem to offer reasonable prices till you add coffee and juice). We had the cheeseburger with egg, and the bacon egg and cheese.  I wanted to try more but their sandwiches are filling. This was a welcome breakfast stop after wasting time with Earl of Sandwiches manufactured egg sandwich. (They were cheaper but the eggs were factory formed scrambled patties...) The brioche bun was perfect and on the lighter side. The spreads like the Dijonaise or chipotle ketchup could have been a little stronger, but they weren't disappointing. Coffee was excellent. I'm going back."}
{"text":"Waited in the long line that took about 15 minutes.  Ordered the Slut, Gaucho Sandwich and the House -made buttermilk biscuit.  The food was ok.  Nothing to write home about. The biscuit, you wouldn't give it a second thought anywhere else.  

The slut was interesting but not amazing, not bad but not... omg we need to stand in line for this. 

The gaucho sandwich was good and could have been great if they would have seasoned the meat even a little.  The other ingredients were perfect but very bland meat.  WARNING: the over easy egg will explode all over you.  Tons of napkins.  

Tried it. Once and done. 


My wife is laughing as I'm typing this. I said \"what?\"  She said 3 women walked up to the counter and said \"3 sluts\".  The cashier laughed and one of the women raised her arm as in... yeah well... either way."}
{"text":"The first time i stubbled across this place was when i was vacationing in Vegas and decided to roam around the Cosmopolitan hotel and there it was on the second floor. Had a few friends that told me about this place so it was a no brainer to try it out considering the line wasn't to long. Took about a 20 minute wait in total (making the line to being served and getting a seat). I had the sausage egg and cheese and my lady had the Fairfax. Both breakfast sandwiches blew us away. Both cooked to perfection. The buns were soft and fresh and the eggs had just enough season to give it nice little pop. I will continue to go back any location i come across."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long lines even early in the morning, but worth the wait. His favorite spot out of Los Angeles has an equally large cult following in Vegas. It's a fairly limited menu but as long as you're there for eggs you'll find something you enjoy. We did have one small issue with a special request to leave sauce off of a sandwich being messed up. But the kitchen was quick to resolve the issue and give us a new sandwich as ordered. My favorite item is a soft scrambled sandwich with the addition of bacon. Note it was about an hour overall on a weekday around 9 AM to get food."}
{"text":"The mediocre egg dishes could be easily prepared by the average cook at home. Not worth the 35-40 minute wait from line to eventually getting our food on a fall Monday morning. WORST part is the $5 coffee. I don't usually complain about prices if the quality is there. I'm sure they have some artisanal blah blah story about their coffee, but it tastes like something you pick up at a gas station. Gas station equivalent coffee served for $5 a pop with some mediocre eggs. I think the popularity extends from the name, which provides undue flare to an average dining experience. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest I didn't really know what to expect from this place. However the fact that about 30 people were waiting in line made me think it must be good. So I gave it a shot.  It didn't quite take as long as I thought, I probably only waited about 20 minutes in line and then when I placed my order it was super quick to receive.  I ordered a sausage egg and cheese with bacon and really enjoyed it. I'm not sure where this place gets their meat but the sausage was super juicy and the bacon was perfectly salty, crunchy and smoky. I love that this place took me by surprise,  will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food, any time of day, which is helpful in Vegas, after a long night.  The bacon and egg sandwich was tasty, and a bit nessy.  I had mine with mayo, instead of the standard ketchup, and it was awesome!  Definitely worth checking out, if you want to avoid long lines for a table, and just want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite breakfast spot we ate at in Vegas. Be prepared for a line anywhere from 8am-noon. After that, you may walk by and think that they're on their way out of business it's so deserted- don't let that fool you! It's a bit pricey, but everything in Vegas is. Service was quick considering the length of the line (we waited maybe 20 min, and the line was backed up to the bathrooms in the hallway) and they were friendly. Egg was cooked perfect. The sausage was probably not my favorite, but it was still good."}
{"text":"We had the slut, fairfax, biscuit and lastly the bacon, egg and cheese. It was good, but the slut was salty. The eggslut is in the cosmopolitan and if you park more than 1 hour then you have to pay for parking. All of the casinos are making you pay for parking now!!  Agh!  Also, it was $35.  Kind of expensive for egg sandwiches. Otherwise, staff was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I came by at about 6 pm on a weeknight just to pick up a biscuit and a cookie to try. I wasn't asked if I wanted it for there or to go, so they immediately started heating it. When I corrected them, they didn't hesitate to replace the biscuit and cookie. 

Once I tried them, I must say that I was not a fan of the biscuit. It's too buttery and a little too chewy. As for the cookie, it was not bad. I can tell they use high quality chocolate and a lot of it. The cookie was a little harder than a prefer but not terrible. I especially liked the amount of salt they used, but I really love salt. 

The prices are high. At $10 for these two items, I can't say I will be buying them again."}
{"text":"4 stars for the burger... 1 star for the service. When paying $16.00 for a burger and a bottle of Coke, I think the staff should freaking smile...at the least.
But, the burger was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"The fair fax sandwich is nothing short of outstanding when loaded with avocado and bacon. Been in Vegas 5 days an lined up every morning since discovering this joint. By far the most rewarding lineup in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Wait in a long line. Food came out fast. For a breakfast place in Vegas it's good but anywhere else ehhhh."}
{"text":"absolutely love grabbing their \"Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich\"before heading to Marquee Dayclub!  It's so tasty! the perfect savory & fatty snack/meal in my opinion.  The eggs are perfectly cooked (over medium eggs)!  The chipotle ketchup and brioche bun make the sandwich unique and extra good. Compared to other burger/sandwich joints, I think the sandwich was really reasonably priced (about $8.90), especially being at a nice hotel."}
{"text":"I went on Tuesday morning and it seemed pretty busy. The cashier did not take down my name correctly so I waited a long time for my food. He gave my sandwich to another customer by accident who ended up bringing it back and then did not offer to make a new sandwich. They also did not apologize for the extended wait. I felt it was overpriced."}
{"text":"It's 5pm on a Wednesday and they are out of Egg Sluts...yes AND sausages. WHO'S RUNNING THIS PLACE!?!?!?"}
{"text":"So Good! 

I don't even like egg sandwiches but my husband really wanted to eat here and let me say I ate almost every bite of mine."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were good but not sure worth the wait of the long line. Service was fast and they allowed me to change my order after I had already paid for it and was waiting in line for it to be made. Little on the pricey side for what u get but it is Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich but they messed it up and I got two eggs and no sausage.  Got here at 8 am on a Friday and it took about 20 minutes to get through the line but they have the dance club music pumping so it was cool. Just don't be in a hurry.  If I were staying here I would come back as it is pretty reasonable for being in the hotel. Cool place."}
{"text":"Ehhhh...Not really sure what the hype is all about. It's an expensive breakfast sandwich. It was tasty, but not worth standing in line over. Prices are typical of most food items on The Strip (expensive). Orange juice was really good, but again, the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I thought the food itself was outstanding, but the cashier added a few items to my bill that I didn't order.  Unfortunately I didn't notice until after I paid, and when I questioned him, he said only a mgr could give a refund.  Coincidentally, the mgr wasn't there, and wouldn't be there for another hour.  So I was told that I was welcome to wait.  Really??!?  WTF?!?!"}
{"text":"Sad to say I found this to be incredibly overrated. The line for breakfast on Sunday morning was around the corner and down an entire hallway. It almost took 45 minutes to get to the cashier and another 10 to get my order. There's no real sitting area except a few high tops that feel like they're in the walkway and a few tables. Staff is friendly but nothing to rave about. Slut puns are everywhere which was funny and unique. 
Food was disappointing though. I don't eat meat and they made a fuss about taking the bacon off the egg and cheese sandwich. My egg was so runny I couldn't bite into it without it oozing everywhere (sorry for the visual there). I wouldn't go out of my way to ever come back here. 
Location: 2nd floor of the Cosmo"}
{"text":"Just one more example of how the Cosmopolitan is a cut above, eggslut provides a fast(ish) food experience, great for hungover mornings. My one complaint is the line. I sat there for probably 20 minutes eagerly awaiting my order. Once I took that first bite though, it was all worth it. Bacon, egg, and cheesy goodness that was made better by my balcony views of the Strip. The fresh buttermilk biscuits are made all the more delicious when spreading copious amounts of honey butter all over them. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"All the hype! Not worth the wait or the chance to get food poisoning.  I do not like to give bad reviews, but this needs to be called out. 45 minutes for a breakfast sandwich, seriously?? In addition, watch the person making the bacon, he was dripping raw bacon juice on the cooked eggs while putting the bacon on the grill.  Yes, it is fresh and quality ingredients, but not worth the wait or risk of getting sick. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the hype but in the end was disappointed. Waiting in line for 15min, then waiting for your food for another 20min after being told 7-10min was a little irritating. I understand due to the long line and amount of staff there was going to be a wait, but I recommend always telling the customers an accurate time or always estimating over so expectations are met. After finally receiving my sausage, egg and cheese sandwich I was the most disappointed when my bread wasn't warm and the ingredients inside were a luke warm. It was just made in front of me but it was almost like it was sitting out for a while. I give Egg Slut a 3 star because the price is not bad but I will only go back if there is no line. I honestly don't understand what the hype is."}
{"text":"At 3 AM.... what's better than a perfectly cooked cheeseburger with an egg on it?  Come on!  Eggslut is amazing!  The best food ever.  It's right outside of Marque in the Cosmopolitan so when you come out of the club.... your egg awaits you."}
{"text":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! 

Tiny portions!!! Expensive prices! 

Visiting Vegas for the first time and relying on yelp brought me to this place. 

I love a good breakfast/brunch place, being from the UK and visiting the US regularly, I always expect good food to be in large portions.. this place was not that! 

We arrived at Egg slut around 11:30am, the line was huge, as expected.. 

I had already decided I was going to get 'the slut' as it was famous on the menu.. however during our wait in the line I noticed how small the portion size was as I looked at others eating.. I was shocked that this was nearly $15 and could be consumed by the average person in less than a minute... you get a little jar of eggs and a slice of bread on the side in a cardboard container... I was shocked and disappointed, and then decided to change my choice on the menu.. 

I ordered the sausage egg and cheese sandwich.. this was $12 I expected it to be a decent size.. however I was left disappointed when the food arrived.. it tasted good, but the size wasn't great.. I could have eaten at least 2 of these before being content.. 

Our total bill was $25 for two sandwiches.. stupidly expensive for a simple sandwich/batch/roll..

I seriously don't see this big hype.."}
{"text":"This eyecatching, naughtily named restaurant is a famous, trendy chain located in the restaurant area at the heart of Cosmo. Seeing as I was staying in Cosmo, I had to try it. I went early in the morning at 8am and...stood in line. It was a short line that took forever. Not the restaurants fault really more the slow people (and line cutters) to blame, but if you're in a rush, pass on this.

Their offerings are basic: medium easy egg with bread, devilled egg with bread, or their Mason jar (steamed egg?) with 'tates. Their menu is simple, which I normally love, but I expected more egg-sanity (#trademark)  than what was offered. 

I ordered the breakfast sammie: turkey patty, medium easy egg, cheddar cheese on a toasted brioche bun with their eggslut sauce. At $8.50, it was quite affordable given, what I hope/expect are, quality ingredients. Anyone wanting a breakfast sandwich should definitely go here over McDonald's, but I really didn't see what the hype was about. 

The turkey patty was overpowering and larger than I would've preferred. The egg, while deliciously runny and a bright hue of orange, was awkward and not centered. When I make myself eggs, you bet I shape them so that the yolk falls in the middle of the white. So, cmon ES. The brioche bread, though, was perfectly buttered and grilled... brioche pairs extremely well with egg, as it's an eggy bread itself. But beware, this sandwich packs a heavy caloric punch! I'm guessing 1000cal for this guy. 

Anyway, I didn't try anything else. I hear the Mason jar egg (the namesake item) is special and amazing; but I'm not interested in trying it. I would pass on eggslut. It's just a shrug."}
{"text":"Worth the crazy long line. Waited about 25 minutes but man was it good! The sandwiches are all great but the biscuits are just amazing! Service is fantastic and once you get up to the counter they are very quick. Don't get scared by the line because  it moves relatively quickly and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and quality was all excellent.  They need to recycle their disposables.  Price is also high, but it's Vegas casino."}
{"text":"Three stars might even be generous...totally underwhelming. I do not understand the hype over this place. The buttermilk biscuit was bland. I will say, the maple butter that came with it was very tasty. I wouldn't have eaten as much of the biscuit as I had without it. I also got the Fairfax as did my husband as well as the Slut. The Slut was the best item but even that was underwhelming and pretty bland, not to mention small. The siracha mayo on the Fairfax was tasty but I could've made this sandwich at home. In my opinion, this place is not worth the hype or the price."}
{"text":"We found out about Eggslut when we were at Grand Central Market when we first tried it. Ever since the Las Vegas location opened, it has become our tradition to eat Eggslut as a breakfast/brunch item of our weekend. Our favorite menu item has got to be the pictured Gaucho sandwich ($15). Although it's one of the most expensive items on the menu, it is worth it! The seared wagyu steak along with the over-medium egg and chimichurri sauce makes for a great sandwich combination in the morning. The brioche bun is definitely a nice touch, which makes this an even more awesome sandwich choice! 

Recommendation: It's definitely worth it to at least try the \"Slut,\" which is one of their house specialties: cage-free coddled egg over potato puree inside a glass jar, which comes along with baguette bread on the side ($10.50). Although the name of the establishment and the menu items may be risqué, that's the beauty of what makes you remember their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Eggslut is a must-go-to breakfast joint when in Vegas. Yes, the lines are long during peak hours, so try to go during \"slow times\". Best to avoid weekends if you can! I've been a few times between the hours of 1-7pm during the weekday and have had to wait in line no longer than a few minutes. My favorites are the \"Fairfax\" and the \"slut\". The scrambled eggs on the \"Fairfax\" are so creamy and the onions, sriracha mayo, cheese on a brioche bun is just an overall great combo. The portion size of the \"slut\" compared to the cost, may seem pricey, but this potato puree magicalness is worth it! The prices are a bit more expensive than the LA location, but the taste is just the same. A restaurant that can keep original quality in a 2nd location gets 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is by far one of my favorite breakfast places. First of all, the name is amazing. As someone who loves eggs, I can relate. The menu is very simple with limited choices, so it makes it easy to decide. All of the meals are delicious so you really sang go wrong. The sandwiches can be gooey and messy, so be warned. But it's worth it. 

Yeah, there's long lines. Yeah, there might not be a lot of seats available. But again, worth it."}
{"text":"The slut was amazing. Make sure after a couple bites you dig deep with your spoon to get the potatoes. Quick and wholesome bite of food for sure. Had heir coffee which was not good but didn't really come here for the coffee hence the 5/5 stars still. Def coming back here if I come through his way again! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place in LA and was happy to see they just happened to open the day I came to town. There was a bit of a line, which we expected since they are new. It moved quick enough and we were able to order our items. I added grilled onions and chives to my bacon slut, which was incredible. My husband ordered the gaucho, but unfortunately did not get to try it. They had run out, so they substituted his item with a burger and refunded our entire order. We were impressed by the customer service and both thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches."}
{"text":"Egglslut offers the perfect hangover/comfort food.  There was a line that moved really quickly.  The casual ordering and sitting situation was perfect for the morning after a late night.  The service and food were great.  This place is an awesome addition to the Cosmo!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the Gaucho, with bacon added and he also added turkey sausage to his. The sandwich was delicious. The wagyu was super tender, the egg was perfectly done, and the chimichurri complimented it all. I'm hooked. But only giving 4 stars because they were out of the coddled egg over potato purée in a jar- and that's why we stood in line for 20 minutes to begin with."}
{"text":"Eggs out was exactly what I expected it to be. I had heard that it was really good food and made from the highest quality ingredients. As I bit into my sausage egg and cheese sandwich I could tell this was true. The sandwich was juicy and not too salty. The egg wasn't over cooked which is normally my biggest gripe with breakfast sandwiches. The food left me very thirsty so I would recommend a drink with your sandwich. I think the food is overpriced for the amount of food they give you. I could've eaten two sandwiches, but I can't afford to buy two sandwiches."}
{"text":"Line can get stupid long because its next to marquee. About 9-15$ for an item. Guys would need 2 to feel full but its so good"}
{"text":"I randomly stumbled upon this when I was actually on my way to a burger restaurant right next to it. I've seen the restaurant on social media like snapchat countless times so I was way more thrilled to have seen this place than going to the burger joint. While waiting in line (a short line), guy behinds me said that lines are usually way longer and that they run out of food quick cuz it's that good. I originally wanted the gaucho, but it was all sold out (this was like 5pm), so I settled for the slut, which consists of a coddled egg over potato purée and three pieces of baguette. I also ordered the fairfax, homemade biscuit, and OJ. The fairfax was such a great sandwich. I usually don't like scrambled eggs but this one was really soft and flavorful. We added turkey sausage to it for a heartier meal. Don't underestimate the biscuit - the color isnt the normal golden brown, but it tastes SO GOOD. $5 for a huge biscuit - not bad. However, $5 for a small cup of OJ was a bit overboard, but can't expect much at a place like Vegas. I wish they had one back in East Coast because I would love to try the Gaucho sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Yum. We came here are last day in Vegas and it was so delicious. I regret nothing about coming here. 

The line looked long but in reality it was super short. 

Did I mention they literally use real eggs. Like crack them right in front of you and everything. Omg so good. So glad we found them. Also, their OJ is so good too!"}
{"text":"If you were wandering hungrily around the Cosmopolitan Casino and saw a winding line leading to a place called \"Eggslut,\" you would hop on it, right? Right. And you wouldn't regret waiting in said line for half an hour and then for your food another 15 minutes because it will transport you to breakfast heaven. This place still feels like a food truck operation but the food is honest and the combo of flavors delicious. And reasonable! Where else are you going to get a very decent breakfast for $8 on the strip? We both got the Fairfax, which is \"cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun\" plus fairy dust I guess because it's amazing. The fresh squeezed orange juice is great as well. And they open AT midnight on Saturday and Sunday just in case you were doing something late in a casino on the weekends."}
{"text":"Yes, it is overpriced and there is always a bit of a line, but I'd rather come here than attempt to go to the one in DTLA. 

Their menu is not very extensive so I actually had a hard time deciding if there was anything I really wanted. I ended up getting the SLUT for $10 (you'd think it's cheap, but it's not). It is a \"cage-free coddled egg on top of house-made potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette.\" It's kind of small but honesty enough to hold me over for a meal. It is definitely something I want to attempt to make at home, as it just tastes like mashed potatoes with poached egg and sea salt. 

Overall verdict is it's good but pricey. Definitely worth a try if you've never had it and especially if you're in Vegas because it's a lot more convenient at Caesar than elsewhere. Otherwise, not something I'd seek out every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I tried Eggslut for the first time on Tuesday and it was amazing. I ordered the Fairfax and the gentleman at the register suggested ordering it with the Wagyu and WOW!! As soon as I took my first bite my taste buds were going crazy. The flavors on the sandwich were so delicious. My friend who I was with got the Slut and a regular breakfast sandwich, but nothing compared after I tasted my Fairfax with Wagyu. It was a little pricey, but it is the strip and I had Wagyu so $18 for a sandwich not the worst I have ever seen. Service was quick, but if it is busy like it was seating can be a problem. Definitely will be back and a must try for anyone near the Cosmo!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations was too high. When I went by this place during brunch time, I saw the long line and it looked so crowded. But today I finally try \"slut\" on menu , unm.... the egg in the cup was too salty! Taste was not healthy."}
{"text":"Don't let the line scare you it goes by fast we were at the end and it wrapped around the corner. We were only in it for 20 minutes and once we ordered it come out within 15 minutes! The food here was incredible my girlfriend and I ordered the Bacon, egg and cheddar cheese sandwich. I don't like egg yolk and this changed my mind! Every single bite had bacon in it and the bread is so soft. I ordered mine with the chipotle ketchup which I thought had a bit too much but other than that it was delicious! We also had the butter milk biscuit which we thought was so good!"}
{"text":"Fairfax.  Just order it.  Don't forget to add bacon to it.  Sooooooooooo good.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and a killer, killer cold brew coffee.  Yeah, I will take a continuous IV of that coffee all day long, baby.  The wait was a bit long so that is the only ding I give this place but jeeeezzzzus that breakfast sammy was on point."}
{"text":"Great Burger.    Very tasty and very very good quality meat.   My only problem and I get it, but with out fries you can't get a 5 Star review.   Sorry.  But awesome cheese burger."}
{"text":"Had the bacon, egg and cheese and it was pretty good! We got here around 7am so we didn't have to wait too long in line. 20 mins later, we had our meal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The wait time is so long here, not sure it is worth it. On a Sunday morning at 9:30am, the line was around the corner and halfway down the hallway. It took about 25 minutes to get through the line and order and we got excited for the food. But then we waited another 20-25 minutes to receive our order. It takes way too long to make such a simple sandwich! 

People rave about Eggslut, but I think it's overrated. I guess it's kind of cool to watch them cook, but I just got more hungry. 

I ordered a sausage and egg sandwich but it was alright, nothing super spectacular in my opinion. My sister ordered the eggslut (coddled egg in a jar), that was more interesting and unique. It was tasty too. Her order came out faster than mine although I ordered first. I waited ten more minutes for my food, that's ridiculous. 

I'll most likely opt to try other places for breakfast the next time I'm in town. Good to try one time, not worth the long wait. If it were faster, that'd be better."}
{"text":"If you wait until around 1:30-2 pm on a Saturday the lines are very short! Amazing food! Best egg sandwich I've ever had by far. The fairfax is excellent and definitely try a slut. Will definitely be back here and will go to the LA locations too!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Ok. That is too short for my review but it's true.  Bread was perfect. Eggs and preparation was perfect. The only huge issue is how busy they are. That line gets LONG!  Fairfax and add Avocado. Yup. Or just go with the Slut and enjoy that little.jar of creamy goodness."}
{"text":"Food was good but overrated. Spent 20 min in line for good eggs cooked in a buttery brioche bun. Maybe it's just me but I wouldn't come back here if I had to wait."}
{"text":"I came and conquered the eggslut and it was egg-cellent. The wait wasn't terrible - maybe 20 minutes. But you order/pay and walk through the line while you watch the cooks make all the beautiful little slut sandwiches so you don't realize time is flying. Be careful when you take your first bite though because it can get messy (see picture). I can make some rated R comments here but I will refrain. 

The only downside is that there are no potato options on the menu (i.e. hashbrowns, potatoes, fries, etc) and I really miss it. Breakfast just doesn't seem complete without it. But other than that it was delicious and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"After salivating about this place for at least 2 months we finally made it to Vegas to try it out. We walked right into the Cosmopolitan Resort and made our way up the escalator to Eggslut. Worried about a long line, we arrived early, like 8 am. It can be deceiving because you think the line is short at first then you walk around the corner and the line could be all the way back the hallway. Lucky for us it was relatively short. We waited maybe 10 minutes to order a Slut and a Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich. The Slut is what I've been waiting for and it didn't disappoint with its creamy perfectly seasoned potato purée and just gooey enough coddled egg topped with gray salt and chives. I thought I was in Heaven. The toasted baguettes added enough crunch to make this a perfect combination. The hubs got the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich and I had a couple of bites. The Chipotle Ketchup added a little kick to the just crispy enough bacon and egg and made this sandwich a winner, winner. I've read reviews where it's not worth the wait but for us we would've waited at the end of the long line at the end of the hall for this breakfast duo that made our trip!! Thanks Eggslut, we'll be back someday!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  From the time I started in line until when my eggburger was delivered was 40min.  The line and wait only grew longer as time progressed.  

One would think that a 40min wait and $16 for a eggburger and a water would be rewarded by decent food.  Not the case.  The eggburger was on a cheap high startch bun, sausage was nothing special and the egg was just and egg.  The Aioli mayo was in my opinion 90% cheap mayo and maybe 10% good Aioli.  (Really
..I've heard of watering down drinks but this goes to far).  

Topping off my experience was the eggburger bursting in my hand and jetting out yoke all over my arm.  

Burger King or McDonald's is better tasting and cheaper..plus you won't waste an hour of your time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Late night munchies? Eggslut's got you covered.

My first experience at Eggslut was at the Grand Central Market in LA. I remember not being completely blown away, mainly because of the huge line and the high price for what it is.

Vegas is pretty much no different EXCEPT that it's Vegas and everything is pretty overpriced, so that makes the higher prices of Eggslut kiiiind of okay. We were looking for a quick late night bite, and lucky for us, Eggslut is open at all hours of the night. We arrived around 2AM and were surprised to only find a short line of about 3 people. (We thought the post-club crazies would be everywhere.)

We ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and the Fairfax. If I were you, I would go straight for the Fairfax and add some bacon to go along with it. The eggs are super fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The bacon, egg, and cheese is exactly what it sounds like, but I wasn't a huge fan. (Major props to this sandwich for the runny egg porn, though.)

Quick and easy bites, even better if you're craving something late at night or post-clubbing."}
{"text":"be prepared to wait in a very very long line.
However, its worth it. The bread is delicious and the sandwiches are unique and so flavorful. If you're a breakfast sandwich fan this place is worth a visit"}
{"text":"This place is good, i think the bread makes the sandwich for me. First off, first time.we came here this line was loooooooong. Like wrapped around the corner-long. So we abandoned plans and went to marquee. 

Second time the line was reasonable (also, it was way early) and we got some sammies. I had the fairfax. It was delish! Worth the hype? Yes. But i still wouldnt wait in a line for an hour for it. 

Solid breakfast sport and with the care and attention they provide you know its made with fresh ingredients and handled with care."}
{"text":"Had the fairfax, gaucho and the chocolate salted caramel cookie and they were all really good. There was a line which actually went pretty quickly and the food was out in a few. It was a bit pricey as we spent $45 for this and two waters but you are in Vegas. The gaucho was $15 +$2 for avocado but there was a lot of steak which made up for the cost. Definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I had the fair fax and it was delicious. Wait was about 20 minutes. Not too bad. Egg was so fluffy. I asked for it to go when I got my order and the lady was not so nice about it. Have a smile lady, it cost you a star."}
{"text":"Stopped by Egg Slut on a Saturday morning. There was no wait to order or to receive my order. Very impressed with there service and food!"}
{"text":"I got the Fairfax. It was a good sandwich, but I didn't understand all of the hype about the place after trying it. My husband got the popular gaucho sandwich and LOVED it. I guess I ordered the wrong thing. Not that mine was bad... just not worth that long wait."}
{"text":"Came at noon and the wait to order was 20 min... Then the wait to get food was another 15 min or so. But... It was worth it! I got the Fairfax sandwich and added avo and turkey sausage. Delish!"}
{"text":"I was staying on a line like 30minutes. But it's nothing about that. Me and my wife ordered same stuff - two egg sluts. So some one cooked both of them and put on server table. Guy who works there gave one to me and one to some friend on the middle of a line(8ppl behind me). I asked why. He said u will wait another. Wtf?!
Food 4/5
Atmosphere 4/5
Stuf shit."}
{"text":"Lazy quick review:

My favorite breakfast sandwich ever!

I always order \"the slut\" and 1 sandwich.  I recommend doing that for fullness factor.

The slut = loose morals and high (on flavor!). Definitely try this and ask for extra bread (it's free).

Sandwiches in order of my favorite to least (although all are really good):
1. Fairfax (add bacon). The best!
2. Bacon egg and cheese 
3.  Sausage egg and cheese (the honeymustard aioli though!)
4. Gaucho 
5. Cheeseburger"}
{"text":"The rave is TRUE!! The SLUT WAS AH-MAZING!! It's creamy texture paired with the baguette were perfect partners. Some say there could have been an extra slice of baguette, but for me.... I almost ate it all without the baguette. Damn it. It was so delicious with simple yet complex flavor profiles."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant..... Limited seating, limited menu ~ we had to wait in line about 10 pp ahead of us, it moved pretty fast ~ this is a \"Hot Ticket\" in town so expect a line ~
   That being said everything we had was quite good. Fresh  juice was DEELISH, and a generous portion for $5. Ordered the Fairfax, also a generous portion on a Gr8 Brioche Bun, could have shared with my daughter ~ I did ask for the eggs to be cooked more than the menu stated, the Mayo & hot sauce combo very good not over powering, melted gooey cheese~ making my mouth water again. 
   Our daughter had the \"Slut\" which is potatoes, egg yoke then egg white gently cottled served with French bread slices ~ she said it was VERY GOOD! and would reorder.
   The one misstep is the biscuit ~ nice flavour, real good butter & syrup.... However it's served @ room temp. This would be \"OUTTA SITE!\" If it was HOT! or atlas the warm ~"}
{"text":"The line is long but worth the wait. I originally ordered without the sauce but they accidentally left it on and I'm glad they did. Would go back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place in socal but haven't quite made it out there.... so I was totally eggcited (see what i did there) to see it at the cosmo on my most recent trip to Vegas.

Maybe I was hungry or in need of food after laying out at the pool all day we got the gaucho and the slut.

If you've never had eggslut, the slut is interesting and should be tried, but I don't think I would get it again, it sits very heavy in your stomach probably from all the potato puree.  the mixture of the seasonings and egg really go well together though especially on the baguette toasts.

I would however come back for the gaucho.  It's made of wagyu tri tip, the flavors witht he arugula and seasoning and then the fried egg.... it was sooo goood. the only complaint from my boyfriend was it wasn't big enough and he was still hungry.  I would probably eat that and be full for reference though.  Not sure if it's the same prices as socal or since it's vegas but the sandwich was  $14 and the slut was $10.  There's not a ton of seating like one bar that allows you to sit facing strangers (which you often do).

Try the slut if you're curious but if you only get to order one thing.... I would get the gaucho. mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Bacon Egg & Cheese was good.  Worth the 30
Min wait from the time getting into line and getting the food.  I wish I had tried the other menu items, but I alone and didn't think I'd be able to finish more than one item (don't think the food would taste that great later, sandwich got cold fast while I was taking pictures of it )"}
{"text":"We had the 

Gaucho Sandwich and the Fairfax Sandwich with bacon.

Absolutely amazing, the flavors were really good. My favorite thing to eat in Vegas now at 9 in the morning."}
{"text":"I've never been to the LA location, so while I was in Vegas I took the chance to come here. 

There was a line formed when I got there but it moved fairly quick. Decided to order The Fairfax which is soft scrambled eggs with cheese and Sriracha mayo between brioche buns. Added turkey sausage for an extra $3. So good! I enjoyed every bite. It was a little bit messy to eat but worth it. 

The only negative is the cost of items. My sandwich was $11, and a cup of fresh OJ was $5 which came out to be under $20. Also, very limited seating."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are messy. Not sure how to eat the egg sandwiches to avoid the egg exploding on your face and clothes."}
{"text":"One of my favorites for sure... great service and friendly chat!! 
Definetely will return!!'"}
{"text":"Ordered the cheeseburger. They forgot my caramelized onions which made me sad, seeing as how I love me some caramelized onions, but it wasn't a deal breaker. The burger itself was well cooked and all the ingredients complimented each other well. The lightly salted patty/bun worked well with the bread and butter pickles.

We came here around 9:00 AM on a Wednesday and there still was a line which speaks of the quality of food here.

Order up."}
{"text":"Having never been able to weather the line for Eggslut in Grand Central Market every time we're in LA, we were happy to know there was an Eggslut in Vegas and made it a point to stop by. The line went pretty quickly, and it's inside the Cosmo which is one of the higher end hotels on the strip. We ordered the Fairfax with bacon and the sandwich was good, even if it didn't quite live up to our expectations. The eggs are cooked really well and the bun is pillowy soft. Adding bacon was a good idea as it added a bit of needed saltiness with the creaminess of the eggs. I couldn't really taste the cheese, and we forgot all about the sriracha mayo and caramelized onions until the last few bites, where it all seemed to have gotten concentrated. All the prices are slightly higher than the LA locations, which isn't a dealbreaker but makes it difficult to justify a Fairfax with bacon and avocado for around $15."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Bread was soft, egg was a perfect over medium, and bacon is always a happy ending.  I thought it was a sit down restaurant. It's not. It's like an \"in n out\" with great quality food. Line was long when we got there on a Friday afternoon, but it went quick. They take your order, you take a seat, then they call your name and you get your food. I had the fairfax. I changed he scrambled egg to over medium. It melts in your mouth delicious. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Ive been reading about Eggslut for awhile now, who wouldnt wanna try this joint out by the name alone? The Slut is a must get, i thought it was a bit steep in price and would be over rated, but i devoured that thing. its so innovative and absolutely delicious. the fairfax is messy, but a must get too. the eggs were fluffy, and the bun was soft and held most of it in together. i wish it were spicy or came with more cheese, but over all the sandwhich was so good. would i wait in line for another 30 mins for another slut? hell yeah."}
{"text":"Overhyped and overpriced - a real letdown. The biscuits are extremely salty and heavy, and the description is honestly misleading. Ordered 5 of these only to realize a party of 6 can't even get through 2 of them. Ugh. And no maple syrup... just that the butter has maple syrup whipped into it? Maybe to offset the extreme saltiness? The Fairfax was decent...the cheddar is not great combo- would have been amazing with American cheese tbh. The cheeseburger is actually quite good, the relish pickles made this probably the best thing in the menu! The biggest letdown?? The slut. Seriously, what a waste of money. Def not worth the wait, energy and money."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas for our anniversary my husband and I decided to try Eggslut.  Place offered walk up counter service that calls your name when your order is ready. We went on a Thursday around one pm and walked right up and ordered with no line.  My husband ordered the egg salad sandwich, which was just an ordinary sandwich with no accompaniment and left him still hungry.  I ordered the cheeseburger which came with a medium fried egg and carmelized onions on very fresh bun and far exceeded my expectations.  Truly delicious.  I encouraged my husband to taste mine and he ordered one as well. Food was delicious!  Simple menu and for the remainder of our trip this place continually had a huge line.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a snack in the Cosmo. Egg sandwiches never go out of style and easy to take with you. If you are feeling ravenous not sure this is the place for a speedy fix- there is always a line. 

Most everything in the menu is good so you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"This spot tastes just as good as the LA grand central market location without the long wait!! There was a line, but it only lasted 5 minutes. Everything was just as I remembered from my first time trying eggslut in LA. Buttery warm buns, egg cooked to perfection and not too runny, and the bacon was so crispy delicious! This time I also got the gaucho. That wagyu tri tip was tender, had a bit of a spice, juicy, and was overall splendid. Though being a local, I'm rarely on the strip but i'll definitely be taking friends out here for breakfast/ brunch"}
{"text":"My husband and I had egg slut and biscuits every morning. When we went down from the room to get this at 10am, the line was very long. And the second time we went around 2pm, the line was moderate. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"A friend told me not to come here, but it's at the Cosmo... How could it not be good? Turns out that my friend just doesn't like eggs much. Well, eggslut hit the spot for the morning sandwich!!

Line was a little lengthy, but it wasn't too bad. The cooks are quick and we got our order pretty quick in my opinion. They know what they're doing! Don't worry!!

I got the Fairfax and my buddy got the original. We both added bacon. Do not skip out on the bacon, you need the protein!! If you're vegan, you're probably not here to eat.  But the Fairfax was great, eggs scrambled, lightly runny. It was just the way I like it. Superb!! Glad I came."}
{"text":"eggslut was awesome - easily exceeding our expectations! My wife and I went for breakfast while we were in town last week attending her work conference. The line (wait) was about 15mins. but nothing crazy. The (counter) service was prompt and friendly. The cold brew coffee was BOMB, and the breakfast sandwiches were even better. I had the Fairfax add bacon, and I would return just for this item. Love the name, love the concept!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside of the Cosmopolitan. I got the Fairfax sandwich, which was a sandwich stuffed with scrambled eggs. At first the first couple of bites were delicious, but after I kept eating it I started to get really sick of it. It was too greasy and cheesy. Also I felt like there was too much bread for the amount of eggs inside my sandwich. I also got the slut, which came in a cute glass container with potato puree and eggs on tops. There were also slices of bread for you to dip the eggs and potatoes. This was okay, but I don't know if it's worth it. Also, it kind of sucked that the seating was limited. There were no seats, so we had to find a table in Cosmo hotel. However the workers here were very polite and diligent, which I appreciated. 
All in all, this place was somewhere I always wanted to try for a long time, but it did not live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast sandwiches! Wait out the line, it moves quickly! The food is amazing but the drinks are very expensive, bring your own! In a beautiful casino! Cannot recommend it enough, went every morning I was visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"LUNCH

Came here just before noon and there was already a queue from the cashier to half way down the washrooms corridor. 

This place is located right across from the Marquee nightclub and just before the escalators down to the casino area. 

The line was moving at a reasonable pace and before I noticed I was already about to order. 

Come give it a try if your in the area. Don't let the line up deter you from getting that slutty sandwich in ur tummy! It was delicious AF :)

Kudos eggslut, I salute you!"}
{"text":"Pros

SLUT: Sooo good, I came back for seconds the day after. The eggs are steamed in a jar so your eggs turn out more soft and creamy compared to other cooking methods. I'm a huge yolk fan so I really enjoyed the soft yolk with the thin and crispy baguette. On the bottom of the jar, you'll get a creamy mash potato purée. 

Location: I'm a morning person and I usually have a meal early in the day so having an Eggslut at the hotel you're staying at was convenient but Eggslut was also a cheap and good enough start meal for mornings and the portions aren't too enormous like the other breakfast joints. It's also in the same floor as the Standard Juice bar if you want a healthier beverage with your egg dish. 

Cons

Bacon, Egg, n Cheese Sandwich: The toppings were fine but the brioche bun they used was extremely dry and brittle. I went during the early morning and late night and there was no difference, it was a dry and tasteless bun regardless of the time of day you go."}
{"text":"Heaven knows everybody in Las Vegas needs the greasy cheesy eggy carb breakfast to help settle the stomach of its \"night before\" contents. Eggslut fits the bill, with super soft brioche buns, cheesy eggs, and fatty meats. Before 8am is super fast service. Even long lines move quickly, but for coffee, visit the smoothie shop down the way. $4.00 for an 8 oz coffee is more than I wanted to pay, and the coffee wasn't exceptional OR strong. 
My friend had the eggslut cup, which is basically mashed potatoes with a coddled (soft-cooked, almost raw) egg on top. She enjoyed it, but the look of the running yolk didn't do me any 8am favors. 

The line got long on Saturday morning about 8:15 and it took about 15 minutes to order after being wrapped down the hallway, but only 5 minutes for my food. Don't order this via room service, or it will take an hour! 

Try the Fairfax with bacon and avocado.  Next time: the burger."}
{"text":"The eggs on both the sandwich and the scrambled eggs (without the bread) were perfectly cooked. The prices are reasonable for the food, especially in Vegas."}
{"text":"Super Lucky no line for us. I had the Gaucho. Tri-tip was median well which was plus for me. I hate getting it well done. The egg in it was also super runny which made it so good. I love runny yolk. I wish they had more drink options but at the same time its Vegas you could easily get a drink from somewhere else and bring it there."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. Head pounding and trying to recall the events of the previous night, I was amazed at the relatively simple decor of the restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan hotel area. I came to the counter and nervously blurted that I would like to order the slut. The cashier smiled and took my order and gave me a number. After what seemed like an eternity they finally called out my order. Although I think it only seemed that long because it was my first meal of the day. I took a first bite and enjoyed the texture and home feeling of the meal at once. It felt like a comfort food. Paired with the toast it was an excellent addition. I would have preferred more toast to scoop up the coddled egg and mashed potatoes but I'm sure you can ask. Next time I'm in sin city I'm definitely checking out this place again!"}
{"text":"The line is nowhere near as hideous as the DTLA location. Food is solid, but there did seem to be either some confusion or lack of organization with the orders being filled. ( Newer staff maybe?) Just no real sense of urgency on getting the food out more quickly.
This is reason for the 3 stars ( the food is 4 stars)
Still will be back as the wait was 15 min vs the DTLA location"}
{"text":"I stayed very near to the Cosmo.  Good ol' Cosmo.  I waited in line.  I ordered.  I stumbled with my order.  I forgot how to say egg and cheese together.  That was fun.  And I wanted to impress the cashieress so.  Oh well.


I ordered two sandwiches.  I waited to eat them to some time later.  They were still quite good.  They filled me up.  I was surprised.  I would go here again."}
{"text":"Decided to finally give this place a try and it was just OK. It was good, just nothing to write home about, and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"So good, kind of wish I had two sandwiches ahha! Wait was about 15 min so not too bad, they make everything pretty fast. Seating is a bit tough to get but people are pretty respective of each other about seating."}
{"text":"The best drunchies I've ever had at 4 a.m. we got two breakfast sandwiches and the biscuit with syrup but the real star was The Slut. Poached egg on top of mashed potatoes might only sound bomb when drunk but it was one of the most delicious things I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of eggs and breakfast so this is my kind of place.

I got there around 7:30am and it was quite busy already. They have a super limited but well detailed menu, which I always appreciate. Ended up getting a bacon sandwich, sausage sandwich and the famous speciality \"the slut\". The thing about breakfast sandwiches, usually either the meat or the bun isn't warm but everything was all warm and super tasty and juicy! You could really tell they use good quality homemade ingredients. The \"slut\", oh my goodness. The combination of the smooth potato purée and the perfectly coddled egg smeared over slices of baguette.. It was heavenly! Eggslut is easily one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Can't wait to stop by again! 


: 1. SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE: house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun

2. BACON, EGG & CHEESE: hardwood smoked bacon, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and chipotle ketchup in a warm brioche bun

3. SLUT: cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette"}
{"text":"If you just happen to walk into the second level of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and saw the name of the place, you would probably think, \"oh, a place with a vulgar name, that probably just serves breakfast.\"  No one would blame you if you did, except there would be some telltale signs it's just not \"someplace.\"

What you have here is a transplant from a food truck, into a brick-and-mortar restaurant, that features all the staples of egg laden breakfast, and a random cheeseburger added to the menu. Don't be surprised, if you and your kids, neighbors, friends, family, family-one-removed, and others you need wanted with you, jump into the silly 20-45 minute line for food.  It's a place that is a \"slut\" to the mighty liquid chicken.  

Yes, you will think, is it worth it, when there are so many other place to eat food, that is probably awful and full of fail; oh wait, this isn't a place of fail, rather a place for win... if by WIN, you mean You want an egg sandwich.  

Waiting in line, the worst part, is only complemented by the other people who are also wanting one of these lovelies.  Good sir, this place knows it has lines, and does what it can to pump out them goodness.  Get the Fairfax, their signature \"piece-de-resistance\"... add avocado and bacon, because you want the ABCs.. \"A=Avocado, B=Bacon, and C=Cheese\" pressed between your teeth.  Scrambled egg sandwich,.. is actually want you are ordering.  

They make the buns on the property, so they taste fresh.. and buttered.  so really don't deny yourself something full of noms, nommy in your tummy... there is a long line, which is why I can't give you 5 stars, but it's worth going. 

Lines are short late afternoon-before dinner, but after lunch... morning at open, there is already a line of 20-30 customers, so unless you come way before 7am, expect to wait also.  It's okay they are a slut for eggs, because what comes from it, is a well mannered result."}
{"text":"Although it has a limited menu, Eggslut packs a punch. Whether you're trying to shove something down while you're hungover, or just totally innocently looking for a good breakfast sandwich that is portable and reasonably priced, Eggslut doesn't disappoint. You get exactly what is advertised.
My boyfriend and I ordered the original sandwiches with bacon, egg, and cheese. The bun is chewy (in a good way), the bacon is crispy, the cheese gooey, and the egg fluffy. I'm honestly starting to salivate a little just thinking about it (I love breakfast food)...
Their orange juice hits the spot if you're thirsty for some vitamin c, but it's nothing special.
This is another place my boyfriend wanted to visit multiple times during our visit, though we couldn't. However, it's the thought that counts!"}
{"text":"Long line, but worth the wait! Doesnt take long to get your food once you order. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and it was delicious! Every bite tasted so good! Wish my egg was a little more runny, but it was less messy compared to my friends who had more runny eggs. They don't have free tap water, so bring your own water so you don't have to buy it."}
{"text":"We came here since I've heard so much about the LA location. I wanted to experience the hype. 

We ordered the cheeseburger and Slut. Slut is a coddled egg on top of potato puré, garnished with chives and sea salt. The cheeseburger was grass fed beef topped with a fried egg on a brioche. Both items were divine. The Slut comes in this tiny mason jar and I was instructed to mix it immediately so the egg can cook a bit more. Top the mixture on toasted slices of baguette and it's heaven! The cheeseburger was fantastic except it had slices of sweet pickles which we're not fans of, but still dee-lish! 

We'll gladly return either here or LA location!"}
{"text":"Food looked good, but I didn't get to taste it because they forgot my order. So I was reduced to watching my friends eat theirs since there's NO WAY I was going to stand in the 1/2hr long line again!! Lesson to be learned here, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR ORDER! Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan and we would always notice long lines whenever we passed by Eggslut on our way out to the strip.  Finally one morning as we were looking for places to get breakfast we decided to try Eggslut.  I wish we tried Eggslut sooner.  We were in Vegas for 4 days and we tried Eggslut on day 3.

I had the gaucho sandwich and he had the sausage, egg & cheese sandwich.  I love me some runny egg.  This gaucho was perfection.  It was so delicious - I would eat this everyday if I could.

I could not stop thinking about Eggslut.  My husband ended up going back that evening to get me the slut and bringing it back to our room.  I am drooling thinking about the slut.  Buttery goodness with the runny egg on top.  I enjoyed every single bite of the slut as we were watching the Bellagio fountains from our terrace.  It was perfect in every way.  I cannot wait to go back to Vegas to have me some more Eggslut!"}
{"text":"Place was great for a fast breakfast sandwich! Yum! And seriously? It's inside the Cosmopolitan in their food court type area (2nd floor) which is right next door to City Center and Aria(someone made it sound like it was under a mile away) you also have Planet Hollywood across the street. It's no more of a walk then to anything else. We are going back to try other menu items while here. *eggs are runny so beware with your first bites*"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning around 10am. We waited about 30 minutes in line. But definitely worth it!

After we ordered our food, the food was quick to come out. I got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich with their biscuit. And my fiancé had their Goucho sandwich.

Everything was so yummy and tasted fresh. I think it's definitely worth the hype! If you're in the area or staying at the Cosmo I say try them out!!"}
{"text":"YAS, EGGSLUT!! Except, why is there at line at 8:30am on a Wednesday?! Either way, I was in no rush so I waited in that dang line. 

The vibes were just like home - the bone thugz blasting and workers just enjoying the grind really reminded me of Los Angeles & made me miss home. 

If you've read my LA Grand Central Market review, I always get the same thing at Eggslut:
*FAIRFAX (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) - The scrambled eggs are always luscious and beautiful.   SUBBING THE BRIOCHE FOR THE BISCUIT IS CRITICAL. It adds a delicious butteriness and touch of savoriness. Also, this location didn't charge me extra for the substitution! Do note that you won't be hungry at a normal lunch hour after having this baby.

We also ordered their signature slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette)..because you have to at Eggslut. It's like mashed potatoes with extra protein from the egg. Love it. I like that this location has a clear area (to the right of the food pick up) to recycle your jars! 

84/365"}
{"text":"One of the newer places I've eaten in Vegas and it didn't not disappoint the line was a bit long (probably because it was EDC week) but well worth the wait from the music playing over the speakers to the helpful and friendly staff! Will recommend to everyone who comes"}
{"text":"Been there twice, once in Las Vegas, and the second time in Los Angeles, loved it a lot! Everything was very tasty, the combination of every item on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the same thing as the original in LA, which until this point was the only location I had tried. If you like a modern and updated spin on breakfast staples, this is the place for you. Unlike multiple visits to the DTLA locale, I did not have to wait for an hour for food and the line moves very quickly between the hours of 7-9 am (stood there 15 mins maybe? food came out in 5). Much easier to try this popular chain at the Cosmo compared to LA. 

The slut is arguably the most popular dish, and while I do like it, my favorite is the fairfax sandwich (add avocado and bacon of course). The light whipped texure of the egg is divine, I have not been able to replicate this at home. The brioche is nice and soft, and fresh squeezed orange juice is a nice addition to the meal. 

Come at the right time to avoid a wait and you'll be happy with your meal. It's not the holy grail of breakfast but it's very good for what it is. Worth trying for sure, worth the hype up to a certain extent."}
{"text":"It is a simple breakfast but good. Glad it wasn't too much to eat, just enough."}
{"text":"saw a long line while staying at Cosmopolitan. After searching, we decided to give it a try. Yes, we ordered its signature slut, bacon, egg& cheese sandwich, and fairfax sandwich. I have to say I like fairfax more than slut or bacon,egg& cheese one.  bacon,egg& cheese sandwich is too heavy for me but fairfax is well balanced.

Today, I went back to get Gaucho but they still run out. I start to wonder if they did serve this sandwich. However, I ordered Egg Salad, Sausage Egg and Cheese sandwiches and both turned out not that good. Special Sausage Egg and Cheese tastes like the one you can get from McDonald's,besides bread has better quality. However, I will stick to Fairfax."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Eggslut. Came in on a Friday morning at 10am, line already around the corner. Waited about 20 minutes to get to the register. From then they were quick at getting orders out. I waited about 20 more minutes for my Fairfax and Slut. I think someone may have took my sandwich but the runner didn't say anything or compensate me for my extra long wait while other people that ordered behind me got their orders already. She did not apologize. Food was okay, but would've tasted better if the service was not horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing every time.  From LA to Vegas this place is consistently great! Love the Fairfax with bacon and the Slut is a must have"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it was nothing special! The line was long, but we didn't mind waiting. We knew of the LA location and were very excited to try the brand new Vegas location. We come to Vegas often and were happy to have a grab and go place.  All 3 of us ordered the same thing, the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. All our eggs were terribly overcooked and not runny at all. The only thing runny on our sandwiches was the ridiculous amount of ketchup. There was so much ketchup that it overtook the taste of the whole sandwich. I blotted it with a napkin, trying to salvage my breakfast. We were very disappointed and will probably not return."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Holy crap. I came home craving these burgers. The line is crazy long when we got there a little past noon, but definitely worth it, despite the fact it took about 20-25 minutes to finally reach the front in order to place my order. A bit pricey as well, but I don't regret how much I spent considering the amazing flavor in the burger. The space is small as well, so good luck finding a place to sit during their lunch/brunch rush"}
{"text":"Had a egg sandwich this morning and overall it was good but it had extremely strong Flavors. So if you're in to pesto, onions and arugula salad I defiantly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Be prepared to wait in a line in the morning, but if you know anything about delicious food, you go where the line is! Bacon, Egg & Cheese sandwich was to die for! Just the perfect amount of bacon and cheese. Crispy, but not overbearing."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant with amazing reviews! We don't have these in Florida and I was eggcited to try then out! (Get it)  

The ONLY reason it gets a 4 star over 5 is because we had to wait 30mins in line 

Ok the food..... amazing! Eggs done right! Perfect eggs! Yum yum! 

And the orange juice! Sooooo fresh and refreshing  $5 though 

I got a hamburger egg breakfast sand which. So good. Everything was cooked to perfection! Came in a little brown bag. 

Grab tons of napkins before you sit down!"}
{"text":"Yummy and worth a try! I had seen the rave reviews of Eggslut in CA, and was excited to see a location on the Las Vegas strip. We waited in line for about 30 or so minutes, and ordered one Fairfax Sandwich with bacon and an Egg, Sausage, & Cheese sandwich.

I liked my Farifax Sandwich more as it had flavorful eggs, cheese, caramelized onions, chives, & crispy bacon nestled in a soft & fluffy brioche bun, and a slight kick from the siracha mayo. My fiancé however, preferred the Egg, Sausage, & Cheese because of the honey mustard aioli and turkey sausage, which he thought were more tasty components than the ones on my sandwich.

After eating, we were satisfied but not overly full. One sandwich each was the perfect portion to hold us over until we went to a buffet later in the afternoon. I would definitely stop by again to try another sandwich .. Or actually just get the Fairfax again."}
{"text":"I went on a weekday before 10am. There was a huge line, but it went pretty quickly. The service staff is really nice, so that compensated a bit for the wait. I ordered the bacon, cheese and egg sandwich and it was great. But honestly, it's a bacon, cheese and egg sandwich so it's hard to make it spectacular and it's also hard to mess up. So, pretty solid food but honestly not worth the wait for me (but maybe the other dishes are amazing? Who knows)"}
{"text":"I took my sister here when we went to Vegas because she had been eyeing it on Instagram for a long time. We arrived about 15 minutes before their closing time, there was no line at all and the place was pretty much empty. Just 2 other tables.

We just had a late lunch so I didn't order anything because I was still full, but my sister ordered the Bacon Egg & Cheese. She took a few bites and looked mesmerized.. then she told me that I seriously MUST take a bite. I'm not a big burger eater and not a big fan of bacon as I always find them to be too greasy. So I wasn't feeling too excited when she offered me a bite, but when I did take a bite.. man, I almost died. TOO GOOD, TOO GOOD. Still can't believe how good it was and this comes from someone who doesn't normally like burgers or bacon. Still haunted by the perfect marriage of the juicy bacon and the melting egg yolk and melting cheese, oh my God.

Our Vegas trip was short but I'll come back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Got the gluten free bun... for all the hype around this place, I expected something worth the insanely long line, the oily dirty seats and the table I had to \"clean\" with a napkin... but the bun was dry yet greasy, the eggs were watery and the flavors were basic, kind of like a freshly microwaved egg sandwich from your local shitbag grocer. Meh."}
{"text":"Eggslut is a funky spot located inside the Cosmo - right next to some pretty awesome juice and milk bar! Eggslut offers organic, local egg sandwiches. We tried the turkey sausage sandwiches. I had mine on a biscuit which had a much different texture than I was expecting - more grainy than a normal fluffy biscuit. The sandwiches are a little messy when you bite into the egg which is expected. 

Be prepared to wait in line atleast 20 minutes, but once you order the food comes out fast.

Good spot if your looking for a new-age twist on McDonald's egg sammys!"}
{"text":"\"The EGGSLUT experience\", orgasmic and EZ.  One of the best things I ever ate.  Did not think I could have a new culinary experience eating something as simple and EZ as an egg. A delightfully new egg preparation. And i thought i new my way arround an egg.  You got to try THE EGGSLUT."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on Instagram and made it a \"must try\" stop. I ordered the Slut and buttermilk biscuit and was very pleased. My mom ordered the Gaucho and tried a bite and thought it was also delicious. Went around 10 am and waited about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"It just was not worth eating. Both the husband and I ordered breakfast sandwiches and we were both still starving after eating it. For a place that serves eggs I felt like the eggs were not done very well-- wasn't yolky enough. Bacon seemed over cooked. Holsteins did a better job with their egg on my burger! 

I wouldn't recommend it for people who are actually hungry. $8.00 for a sandwich seems like you're getting a deal in Vegas but you're not. You will be in search of more food after. Also buy a drink elsewhere. No need to spend $5 for one drink."}
{"text":"The wait for it was long but once your ordered it was all very quick. I ordered the sausage, egg, & cheese sandwich and my husband ordered the fairfax sandwich with sausage. It was so worth the wait. Pricey for sandwiches and drinks but it was so flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Another overhyped place you can ignore. Too many cons (i.e. long line, very limited seating area, overpriced menu, and dirty eating area.) Food doesn't compensate the cons at all.
I've had some of the more popular items on the  menu and nothing stood out. I've tried the cheeseburger, fairfax, slut, biscuit, salted chip, and (not)fresh orange juice, seriously tasted like cheap bottled OJ."}
{"text":"I'm coming back to eggslut oh my gosh. I had a turkey, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich and completely devoured it. Someone else with me had the same, except added bacon and it looked so good. One person got the Slut, and he was a little disappointed, but he's also an extremely picky eater. Coming back here."}
{"text":"Wow best breakfast for the price I'm Vegas 
They serve eggs and they serve it well
It was so good I went there every morning 
Nothing on the menu disappointed

Must try in Vegas for sure"}
{"text":"We walked over a mile to get here and waited in line for 30 minutes but it was all worth it!

The egg sandwich was delicious-gooey without being gross and the coffee was hot and strong. It's an egg sandwich-granted very delicious but def something which could be replicated. I think the name makes it a novelty and if you're in Vegas def add it to the list!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth waiting in the line! Good size sandwich and it tastes awesome!  Drinks are expensive but it's Vegas baby."}
{"text":"Egg slut! Yes please! I come to Vegas twice a year I always stay at the cosmopolitan.  The one thing that was lacking was a amazing breakfast spot.  I was soooo excited when my promoter told me they put egg slut in. 

Just so everyone knows these egg sandwiches are a step above traditional. I'm from NY I eat a bacon egg and cheese 2 times a week. The egg sandwiches at egg slut are like a gourmet version. Not sacrificing the speedy service. 

Anytime between 8am and 11am there will be a line around the corner. One morning I waited over 30 mins for a sandwich (not joking). There was that many people in line. You can not make reservations or call ahead. I did find out. If you are VIP at the cosmo. They will get your sandwiches for you. Of coarse on the last day. 

The menu is not huge. Egg slut only offers a few sandwiches. The eggs are cage free organic from a local farm. So is the bacon. The bacon egg and cheese is $8 this comes on brioche bun and with chipotle ketchup. The fairfax. Is amazing. It's scrambled eggs with chives cheddar cheese caramalizes onions and siracha mayo.  Sooo fricken good. But the simplicity of the menu is what makes them so good. Along with the organically. I'm a huge fan of only a few items because if you do one thing they will come out consistent every time. This place does some business. Turn over is quick. 

The only complaints I have. There are only a few seats and there bar style. I wouldn't want to eat in here it's too loud. I would bring it to my room 95% of the people were grabbing here food and leavening. The second issue is after you place your order. You have to walk all the way to the other end to pick the order up. You walk through the restaurant to get to the pick up area. Then you have like no place to stand. There's a bunch of people standing waiting for there food. Blocking other people. It was interesting. The one day it was so crowded in the pick up area. I waited outside the restaurant. Behind the bar seating. I couldent hear the girl calling my name. Some guy asked me if I was josh cause my order was ready. It was kinda funny. 

Overall. Egg slut is a much needed addition to the cosmo. I love this place. Great breakfast spot I highly recommend coming here. I will continue coming here every morning I'm at the cosmo. There solid and consistent."}
{"text":"Having followed their Instagram for a while and always drooling over the food poem I was excited to find out they had a location in Vegas during a recent visit there. 

We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes in the hallway that wrapped around the corner from the restaurant. It moved at a decent clip. 

I shimmied up to the counter and my boyfriend and I ordered the fairfax, the gaucho and one slut because of course we had to try the name sake. 

Food came out very quickly and we dug right in. Beware the gaucho is MESSY. You are best off eating this one with a fork and knife unless you are ok with runny egg covering your hands. During the first bite when my boyfriend was still using his hands it burst and went everywhere. After he got the mess under control he said he really enjoyed the sandwich. As for me, I loved the fairfax with the addition of the avocado and bacon. I think it would have been a little plain with out. But I swallowed that thing in three minutes flat. As for the slut, I enjoyed it. Was happy to try it but if ordered alone for a breakfast I don't think you'll be satisfied. It makes a great snack or side to share!

Minus one star for counter cleanliness. These guys are doing a ton of business so it's understandable things are hectic but the high top table where we were eating was out of napkins almost as soon as we sat down and there were crumbs everywhere. A quick a rundown on a regular basis would be helpful. Attention to detail would make this place the standout it should be!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to get to LA to try any of the locations there.  It was almost noon, and we hadn't eaten and the line was short, so we finally tried Eggslut.  We got a \"Fairfax\" and an \"Eggslut\".  The Fairfax was fine.  The eggs are soft, rich, and creamy.  However, the onions and the sriracha mayo seemed lost.  The seasoning is very light.  The eggslut was interesting.  Very rich and unctuous, but I prefer spiciness.  The food was good.  it's expensive.  I'm in no rush to return, but I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"When I come to Vegas, I don't think gambling or clubbing, I think, wow I can't wait to get my sandwich at Eggslut. Their Fairfax sandwich is so perfectly done, with lightly toasted bun and buttery fluffy eggs mixed with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Their biscuits are also worth it, and they come with a delicious honey butter. Lines are long, but they move fast. This is definitely the place for breakfast after a night out!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches out here in Vegas!!! A must when you come to Vegas. Don't be scared of the long line if there is one, for they get through it quick! The FairFax is my favorite sandwich there with there bomb OJ"}
{"text":"Food:
We ordered 2 Fairfax with Bacon, and the Slut and 2 bottles of coke. ($47.00) 

Bread was soggy from egg, but the flavor was good as well as the sauce.

The Slut is really just mushy potatoes with an egg, Interesting but not sure I'd get that again.

Restaurant:
This is where I'd give them more stars. They moved so fast and ran a very smooth operation. The line was about 60 deep but only took about 20 minutes to get through. 

Verdict: I'd come back if There weren't so many other options. It's good but not great, but at the end of the day, eggs are eggs."}
{"text":"Would definitely NOT recommend. Extremely overpriced, I have no clue why the line was so long. My egg salad sandwich cost about 3x more than what I felt I got. 

Presentation was sub-par, flavor was bland (tasted the same as a gas station egg salad), and I definitely ate a couple egg shells that were hidden in my egg salad. And there's nothing special about the buns it came with, tasted the same as grocery store buns.

Would not come back again, nor would I go to the LA location near where I live. At that price and experience, I'd rather make my own egg salad at a fraction of the cost, better taste, and better value."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Vegas!  \"The Slut\" is a must try and I also usually get \"The Gaucho.\"  The long line is definitely worth the wait. It moves pretty fast and you get your food pretty quickly."}
{"text":"After getting pizza from Secret Pizza, my friend and I spotted the golden goose egg that was eggslut. No, our glutton-ness shame of just eating pizza did not deter us from getting in line. We've never tried Eggslut before and we're curious on how good the egg sandwich could be.

We ordered the classic, The Fairfax, and the Gaucho sandwich.

I'll start with the Gaucho. I thought this sandwich was alright. My friend and I thought there was too much arugula, very \"aruguly\" and the beef was nothing I'd write home about.

The Fairfax though, that was delicious. The eggs were creamy, the aioli was savory, the cheese was that dirty American cheese that you always want. The chives added a brightness and the caramelized onions were so dank. No other way to describe it than dank. Then the brioche bun holds all of it together in its warm embrace.

We also traded a slice of pizza for a bottle of water, I'd say they won that trade off but still gave off some good vibes.

I'd recommend the Fairfax to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ventured here for breakfast on back to back mornings. The breakfast sandwiches are the best and reasonably priced. We had the bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, as well as the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Loved them both!"}
{"text":"i think this place is overhyped. The slut tasted great but nothing i would be dying to eat each time I see Eggslut. It was more of a try it once to know thing. I also had the gaucho that was delicious but again, nothing i would be dying to eat again."}
{"text":"Opening day! As I'm waiting in line to order, this place seems to look as cool as its name, which is donned on a Nirvana inspired T-Shirt. I was greeted by a delightfully happy cashier who took my order. I had intentions to order their signature \"slut\" dish consisting of cage-free coddled egg and potato purée, poached in this adorable glass jar served with a side of baguette slices. However I was pulled into the sight of a fresh brioche buns being toasted. So I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich with a cold brew coffee. The wait was rather short for an opening of a restaurant. And the quality and presentation did not suffer. Once I bit into the yummy looking sandwich, both my sense of vision and taste came to agreement. This sandwich was satisfying without leaving you with that heavy carb/breakfast sandwich feeling. I could eat 3 more of these! The sandwich itself is wrapped in what appears to be recycled parchment paper? And then cradled in a paper pocket. You may find yourself licking the paper once your done. I may or may not have, ha ha. The only underwhelming component was the 5 dollar cold brew coffee size. I'm not generally a coffee person but if you are, you may feel discouraged at the site of the cup size. But you're not going to go here for the coffee. You're going to go for the yummy delicious food. Next time I may try their signature slut dish or if later in the day I may feel inspired to try ground angus beef cheeseburger with cage-free over medium egg. That brioche bun is addicting! Definitely a place everyone needs to stop by and order from! Your stomach and taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"Normally when I see a place with either a long line and a seat-yourself policy I pass. So glad I didn't. The line was maybe 10 minutes (and it was super long- these guys just move fast) I dint even have time to finish my Starbucks. And there was no problem getting a table since the turnover was so quick

And the food-so good you guys. The bacon/egg/cheese was super yummy. Eat it over your plate though cause the yolk will spill. If you have the room get a biscuit."}
{"text":"Pretty good. First time here 2 yr ago was awesome. Went down in quality but still good."}
{"text":"The Gaucho Burger was good, but you just ruined my entire day since I got food poisoning from your place. My flight back home after your stupid sandwich was a living hell."}
{"text":"If the name doesn't spark your interest, the food should!

I'm down to have breakfast anytime of day and the sandwiches here are filling and delicious. The Fairfax is my favorite and the warm brioche bun is filled with soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. I've also tried the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich which comes with chipotle ketchup. My man loved his sausage, egg & cheese sandwich and let's not forget about the most interesting item on the menu, the slut. A coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with baguette slices. Talk about making breakfast extra sexy!

If you love eggs this place is for you as the star ingredient is the egg. This place isn't cheap but once you taste it you'll understand why. 

Things to consider ~

This place is popular so sometimes the wait can be long. Not a lot of seating so don't be surprised if you can't find a spot by the time your meal is made (easy solution - keep walking & you'll find plenty of open seating all around the Cosmo where you can sit down and enjoy your food)."}
{"text":"So good. So good. So good!

I am so glad this opened up in the cosmopolitan. I was super bummed for missing out on this in LA on my last trip. Thank the lord I did not have to wait on a huge line. We hit up the joint around noon and was able to get a seat at the table while waiting for our food. The food came out pretty quick.

One strange/awkward thing I wanted to mention. After placing my order and paying the receipt gives an option for tip. Now this place is not a sit down and get served restaurant. It's a self service place... you pay then pick-up your food when they call your name. I always feel so awkward then these type of places ask for  tip because you're put in the spot. To be honest you don't need to give any kind of extra tip here.

The menu is semi-limited in options but still have great choices. I tried the sausage, egg & cheese sandwich (substituted the mustard aioli for the chipotle ketchup). The sandwich was huge and delicious. It kind of reminded me of a McDonald breakfast sausage sandwich but way bigger and a bit healthier. Haha no shade.

The sandwiches here are comparable to the egg shop in NYC. We did not get a drink because the juice and coffee were $5. So cray.

I highly recommend the sandwiches for breakfast or lunch. So delicious and will fill you up."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to get some breakfast! Love the location, it is right next to a bunch of fun spots. Definitely recommend the egg salad sandwich. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The fairfax was delicious! I had it on salad thinking that might be kind of lame, but yay for less carbs, and then was pleasantly surprised by how great it all was together!  If you're a gf human or someone who wants to cut the carbs, the salad option is legit."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait in line, come here in the afternoon. We came here in the late morning, and there was a long line. The sandwich was tasty - light fluffy bread, thick slice of cheese, flavorful sausage. The egg yolk does run, so watch out. It was pretty delicious but I probably wouldn't come here again since it was kind of a standard breakfast sandwich. Definitely worth trying once, though!"}
{"text":"Another great thing about the Cosmopolitan.  Egg Slut is one of the best ever. It's magic"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick breakfast sandwich. Inside the Cosmopolitan.  Clean and line goes quick."}
{"text":"Just arrived at Vegas and heard this place has really good food. We walked about 20 mins and arrived at eggslut which is located in the Cosmopolitan.This place is really easy to find once you walk in.

We lined up for about 10 to 15 mins, as there is only 1 cashier and not alot of seats- so you pretty much have to eat quickly and leave.

This place offers you to substitute bread with salad with no extra charge and the salad is very good.
We ordered the gaucho sandwich - tri-tip wagyu steak - and changed it to the salad.
And of course - had to order their specialty \"the slut\".

Overall i would say this place is worth the wait. 
The steak was soft and juicy and the slut is really unique and tastey."}
{"text":"Good food but damn it's expensive. I get it's Vegas but I come her 4x a year imma go broke. Lmao I'll keep coming back though cause it's the bomb.com food wise and got good lookin servers"}
{"text":"Space:
There is always a line at eggslut, which builds to more of a reason to try It. If there's a line, it's usually pretty good. We came by at around 2 pm and there was still a line so we walked around The Strip and by 3:30 pm there were only a few people in line so we got our food. 

Service:
There isn't really a \"service\" here, you order and pay, they make It and call your name out and you sit wherever you want. 

Price:
It is VERY pricy for the small portions.
\"The Slut\" and Sausage, Egg, Bacon bun costed a little less than $20 

Food: 
Overall the food was really good but very pricy. 

Notes: 
There is a bar type seating that fits about 20 people at max."}
{"text":"It's a bit over priced ($18 for a sandwich and coffee) but hey, it's Vegas. Overall it was delicious."}
{"text":"I came here after going to the day club and the line was not that bad! The guy at the register was VERY friendly!!! Overall really good customer service. I ordered the Bacon Egg & Cheese Sandwich and it was soooo good :')"}
{"text":"I had the Fairfax which was about $8. The eggs in the sandwich are so creamy and goes great with the sriracha mayo and soft brioche bun! The size was ok, I felt like I could eat more after. It'd go great with some sort of potato side like tater tots, but they don't serve sides like that. Overall, It's a good place, just quite expensive for a small sandwich.good to try once if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yes, the line is long - we waited about 30 mins on a Friday morning, but they have a menu posted on the wall, and once you order it only takes about 8 mins to get your food. 

PLEASE people - don't be like the couple in front of us who waited in line for 30 mins - only to get to the counter to be indecisive. They were asking all kinds of questions and humming and hawing, then they shuffle through their purse to find their money to pay. Idiots!

We ordered a bacon sandwich and a original eggslut to split. The sandwich was the winner, they do NOT skimp on bacon and the roll is nice and fluffy. I'm glad we tried the eggslut, it really should come with 2 eggs since the ratio of potatoes and eggs is way off. Also the toast that came with it wasn't properly toasted and a bit flabby. (easy fix, they should be more on their game for that.)

Glad I tried it, would happily go to the NYC location."}
{"text":"Tasty egg sandwich, but not impressed. Overpriced for what it is. I'd rather go see the Earl."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning & was a bit reluctant to wait in the line, but I'm glad I did!
I ordered the Fairfax sandwich, which was super delicious  with the chives in the scrambled egg. It was worth the price and was also fairly light, so afterwords I was content but not overfull. 
Next day I came back for the egg, bacon, & cheese sandwich and it definitely wasn't as good as the Fairfax to me, but still nice. For a first time visit, I'd highly recommend getting the Fairfax sandwich and if you want to get meat on it, to just splurge the extra few dollars for it. 
Overall, a great and reasonably priced breakfast on the strip!"}
{"text":"Slut is very soft and delicious.
You should  try.
It is good even if children eat it.
The meat and vegetables in the sandwich are very fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I do not love eggs, but OMG these are so good. I was in Vegas for a week and went here my last day and I was sad because I wanted to go back. Hands down the best egg sandwich I've ever had. The biscuit was okay, kind of dry, but the bacon slut was absolutely delicious.

The line is super long, but after eating your sandwich you'll know why. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Eggslut very much exceeded any expectations that I had. 
I only got the Sausage, Egg, & Cheese. But wow it was amazing! I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn on what kind of rating to give this place because the sandwich was amazing. I'm from NJ, home of taylor ham egg and cheese (or pork roll, whatever) so I'm very thick-skulled when it comes to breakfast sandwiches and I was convinced no one outside of the state knew how to make a good one. Until now. It was bomb. 

The line didn't look that long initially but ended up taking ~25 mins. There is also very limited seating and every single napkin dispenser in the restaurant was empty. The sandwiches are messy so this was extremely inconvenient. People were running wild with hands covered in egg yolk. Not cute or sanitary."}
{"text":"MMMM thinking back to this makes my mouth water. Maybe it as the vegas alcohol or just a hungry me but i can eat eggs any time of day. This is not a gourmet place but just a drop by get some delicious egg sandwiches and be on your way type (Just made that up). 

This place has few entrees but all of them are on point. Your order takes about 5 minutes and you get to experience a runny egg with bacon. Best thing about this is the price. In comparison to other places in Vegas, this is very affordable. Granted they don't serve as much food as a buffet but that's also a positive in my mind because you won't overeat. I woudl recommend this place for a drop in breakfast/lunch snack or mini meal"}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars, but if I were to factor in the disappointment, it would get 1.  The slut was tasty, but horrifically overpriced.  The bacon cheese egg sandwich had plenty of bacon, not enough cheese, but too much bun, and the brioche was dried out.  To top it all off, we waited 15m in a line for the privilege...

Sad."}
{"text":"We tasted the food here and it was horrible.something about rawslimu eggs on our plate really grossed us out"}
{"text":"Trying to ensure balanced reviews here.

As per a previous review I've had better BEC from corner stores in the Northeast. Also Bojangles has simple and just as tasty BEC on biscuits for half the price. Compared to a similar concept Biscuit Bitch in Seattle, Eggslut was just poor. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't even what I'd call great. It just wasn't worth the social media craziness or the 40 minute wait to register or the 20 minute wait after for the order to be ready. 

Three suggestions:

1. Get another grill or larger location .. I've seen faster delivery in a similar space. (see examples above)
2. Give the customer a chance to wait on the orange juice until after the order is ready ... after 20 minute waiting for food, mine was starting to get warm.
3. Maybe post wait from here is x minutes along the wall. My wife heard 30 minutes was likely. We doubled that (we were almost all the way down the hallway) and she wouldn't have stood there if we knew ahead of time.

I really wanted to like this place, but it is overhyped."}
{"text":"All I can say is... YUMMMMM! Definitely as good as it gets! Normally I am not a breakfast person. I do not like breakfast foods but this place is amazing! My husband and I stopped by on Saturday morning around 8AM and there was already a huge line. We waited about 45 minutes before we finally got to the counter to order. We ordered the slut, bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and the buttermilk biscuit. The food came out pretty quickly and seating was not an issue for us. The slut was the best part of my meal. They serve it in a little mason jar. The server told us to break the runny yolk and mix it with the pureed mashed potatoes and dip the baguette into the mixture. A 'one of a kind' type of food. The breakfast sandwich was also very tasty. What made the sandwich even better was the chipotle ketchup that they put on it. I could have done without the buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was super dense, hard, cold and fell apart just after one bite. Will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas or SoCal."}
{"text":"Come here for egg sandwiches. It is decent. It is not mind blowing good, but good enough for its price. The major drawback is it is slow to get your food. You would think with a small menu of 8 items they can churn it out faster. I was in line with about 15 people in front of me and it took 45 minutes to get one sandwich. If you see a long line, I would skip it unless you really got nothing else to do and want to burn time standing in line."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and tried their famous \"Slut\" - a coddled (i.e. barely cooked, similar to poached) egg served over mashed potatoes, chives, and sea salt.  I expected the yolk to be a bit runnier, but it looks like they maybe overdid it.  The potatoes were not at creamy as I'd like - a little on the granular side.  Its a decent lighter snack, but overall didn't wow me too much.  Maybe its better to stick with their breakfast sandwiches.

Their cold brew coffee was okay, though on the pricier side at $5."}
{"text":"Loved it!  

We stayed in Vegas for 3 nights, and we came to Eggslut 3 times, that is how much my picky husband loved Eggslut.  It helped that we were staying in the East tower of Cosmo, because it was literally just down the elevator ride, but I'm sure we would've made the effort to come here anyways.

Wait:  if you come around 9 or before, the wait is pretty short.  We waited maybe 15 min?  Once it was past 9am, I noticed it got really busy and it died down again later in the day.
 
Service:  the gentleman at the counter was the same man all 3 days, and he was nice and helpful.  There was a lady calling out people once the food was made, and she was very sweet too.  She tried to find us extra chairs so we could enjoy the food at the communal table.

Food:  Delicious!  The brioche bun was so soft and thick.  We had everything from the Slut, to egg/bacon/cheese sandwich, to Gaucho to Fairfax.  We loved Fairfax, but it can get messy.  Be sure to add avocado for this.  We also loved Slut, which is a little salty, but it's perfect when you eat it with bread.  The potato+poached egg pairing is so creamy and delicious.  I even love their simple arugula salad.  The only one we didn't like so much was their turkey sausage.  I wasn't a fan of that.

Price:  A little pricier than Shake Shack, but so much better in my opinion.  I'd rather come here and spend a few extra dollars... it's Vegas, you can't enjoy Vegas if you're worried about a few extra bucks.  

I'd definitely come back again.  In fact, we are thinking we will always stay at Cosmo because it was so convenient.  Nothing like strolling out of bed, picking up some good food, and lounging around back in your room without having to set your foot outside in the Vegas heat.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this spot a 3.5 stars because the food wasn't all that. There was a long line like this place was the place to be for breakfast. The menu is on the smaller side, there's not much options for drinks and who the hell wants cookies in the morning??? There's almost no seating so be ready to take your food to go. I got a bacon, egg and cheese which was just alright but the ketchup had a nice amount of heat. The bun was pretty good too. I would most likely come back but I wouldn't wait in line for 20 minutes again."}
{"text":"Jesus lord thank you for this godsend. You can't imagine how desperate and drunk I was that night in vegas... stumbling around in 6 inch heels looking for tacos but nooo. You didn't give me tacos, you blessed me with eggslut. A fat, juicy cheeseburger with an egg. Drools."}
{"text":"Pretty good Sandwich, I went with the Fairfax sandwich. I waited in line for nearly a half hour so it better be good lol. The brioche bun/bread is what makes the sandwich in my opinion.The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5 star review was they forgot to put bacon on my sandwich(see photo below, one on right has no bacon). They made good by offering to make me a new sandwich but why waste perfectly good food so I just had them put some bacon on a plate and I put it on the sandwich myself, they also threw in a chocolate and salted caramel cookie for my troubles which was nice and delish."}
{"text":"If your an egg lover, this is the place to eat! 

While in line, there is a menu placed on the wall to select what you want in the mean time. 

I got the Fairfax! Suppppppper good, spicy mayo/scrabbled eggs/a cheese slice inside of a brioche bun! 

( Location ) 

Near the chandelier lounge and inside the Cosmopolitan

The line moves by fast and multiple cooks"}
{"text":"Six stars. Read all the Yelp reviews and everyone was spot on. Got the fairfax with avocado and bacon and just, yes. It's literally fantastic and made me wish I had two stomachs just so I could eat another one. We also got a slut which was unique and delicious. Loved the gray sea salt on top. Service was quick, but we came early (thank you yelpers for the tip!)"}
{"text":"Ah, Eggslut, bara jag tänker tillbaka på mitt besök får jag ett leende. Namnet är roligt, och deras meny är unik och spännande. Givetvis är den kombinerad med högkvalitativa råvaror som levereras direkt till restaurangen från lokala källor.

Självfallet var jag tvungen att prova signaturen \"The Slut\" som var oerhört god. Kokt ägg tillsammans med potatispuré och lite till som man rör om till en god och äggpotatispuré. Till det provade jag deras äggburgare med kalkon och dressing som också var oerhört god men lite för stark för mig och jag ångrar att jag inte provade ett annat alternativ som hade mildare sås och kött istället för kyckling.

Sedan tog jag även deras färskpressade apelsinjuice och deras hemgjorda varma chokladkaka som var mjuk med rinnande choklad i när man tog en tugga, gudomligt gott, precis som det ska vara!

Eggslut rekommenderas helhjärtat! En av de bästa ställen jag varit på för frukost faktiskt. Dock så är kön oerhört lång, varje dag, så var redo på det. Men den som väntar på något...."}
{"text":"Delicious egg sandwiches. The  Fairfax with bacon and avocoado is well worth waiting for in the the long line that moves fairly quickly."}
{"text":"If I could give this review a 2.5 I would. I rounded to a 3 because the staff was really nice. This review will be short. So let me get straight to it. I was extremely underwhelmed by Eggslut. The food isn't horrible, but it's not worth a 25-30 minute wait in line. 

I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. The presentation was lovely but for whatever reason, it was messing AF. The sauce kept oozing out and eventually messed up my clothes. The taste was rather bland and left a lot to be desired. Like how does Applewood bacon not taste good? Maybe my expectations were too high. I really don't know. 

Honestly, if you're dead ass hungry and need some food asap. You will be fine. You know what? The meal reminds me of those Jimmy Dean frozen sandwiches. It gets the job done, but you wished you had something else.

Anyway, be persuaded by your own mind and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went there a couple of times for breakfast. You can't go wrong! I'm not a huge breakfast eater, and their breakfast sandwiches were perfect! My go to is the bacon egg and cheese, my husband tried their sausage bacon & cheese and the tri tip. Said they were both good! 
Don't let the line turn you away, it moves fast, and the wait for your food doesn't take long."}
{"text":"Best tasting fast food breakfast in Vegas!  The fried eggs were gooey and delicious.  The orange juice was satisfying. They did not have milk on the menu, but they were able to scrounge some up for my father."}
{"text":"Great concept. Just some small issues with execution.

The idea behind this place is amazing, and I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner on the strip. Tons of drunk, high, hungover people wandering around. FINALLY a place to satisfy their cravings, give them what they need, what they desire. Eggy, cheesy, gluttonous magic on a buttery hunk of bread. MMMMMMM.

The food itself is amazing and the menu very customizable. There is something for everyone, well, everyone who loved eggs, OBV. My one issue is that, in an effort to make this place a little more to-go, there is a lack of seating. Therefore, the problem arises where people who haven't gotten their food yet, scoop up seats and those who have just gotten their food are left holding their plate and deciding, okay I guess I HAVE to take this to-go. Another thing I noticed is that they can get pretty backed up with orders and you can wait a WHILE for your egg sandwich. 

Honestly, it's so good it's worth the wait and battle for a seat, in my opinion. However, I think the the less chill tourist might be deterred just looking at the place. Just saying. Obviously I give them 4 stars, because it's just that good."}
{"text":"I live in Austin, TX and I miss this place like I miss my mothers cooking! This type of restaurant would do so well in Austin! Ever thought about opening up here??? In Vegas, you will DEFINITELY experience a long line, but you'll be to the front before you know it. Don't shy away from the line. I mean, that obviously means it's doing good business! Plus it's totally worth the wait! It may look like a simple egg sandwich, but once you bite into it, you'll feel naughtier than the dirty little Eggslut in your hands."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy! But worth the wait. Honestly, if the place was a little bigger than what it is, the line wouldn't look so discouraging, being that it wraps around the corner. But really it's because they have one register, and more people than they have tables & chairs so it looks highly crowded at all times. BUT I bet that's what intrigues you to eat there, must be good right? Well it is! Just a regular $8 breakfast sandwich but packed with so much taste!"}
{"text":"For an egg sandwich place you get what you wait for.  The sausage egg cheese sandwich is pretty filling and juicy but if I had to wait 2 hours to get one (like at the DTLA location) I would definitely pass.  Fortunately the vegas location the wait isnt that long.  I arrived at 11am on Friday and was out of there by 1130am."}
{"text":"It was delish! I customized my own sandwich and they made it better than I would have. I wish they had more varieties on the menu. But I would definitely stop by again when I'm in vegas!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty overhyped.

Don't come for breakfast. Instead, come after 1pm where lines are shorter.

And it's open past late in the AM. So if you're drunk and  burned enough calories at Marquee, this place is just a short walk away."}
{"text":"This place has amazing egg sandwiches! But only come here if you fill up easily and have $10 to blow. The food is great, but not worth the price in my opinion. Basically a gourmet egg mcmuffin from mcdonalds. This place is the place you come to once to try, and then move on. And it's fun for pictures with the name!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Got the Fairfax with Turkey Sausage and lived every bite. Long wait all day but there was no line at 8:30am!"}
{"text":"Very good quick and easy breakfast! The line always seems to be pretty long though, so if your pressed for time then this isn't the place for you. I got the Fairfax breakfast sandwich with bacon and my husband got the gaucho breakfast sandwich. My sandwich was very flavorful and yummy. My husband said his was great too. This place is moderately priced for Vegas..but the sandwiches are a little small for how much they cost. It's worth checking out though!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is really good for a reasonable breakfast.  The Eggs are made well and they've put some sincere thought on how to cook eggs properly.  However, it's just eggs.  Yummy eggs for sure, but I don't get the cult following here.  I do like that you can make any sandwich into a salad for the carb conscious."}
{"text":"This place is all about eggs. If you love everything eggs then this place is a must try! Take the wait as given..I thought it was well worth it. Came in pretty early this day, but I guess everyone else had the same idea..very bearable if your hangover isn't particularly bad this morning. You'll make it to the front in no time. You'll have plenty of time to decide what to get, considering the menu is fairly selective and several menus are posted alongside the line. Make sure to make this place part of your itinerary when you come to Vegas. I sure will"}
{"text":"If you love eggs and you're looking for breakfast/brunch on the strip, then Egglsut is the place for you. 

Weekend morning lines can be long (down the hallway and practically funneling into the nearby bathrooms). To avoid the weekend line & still enjoy your morning Eggslut...set an alarm and head here early (came by on a Sunday morning and ordered without a wait).

The Slut :A coddled egg on top of smooth potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette.
It's a glorified mashed potato dish.  Playful presentation in a glass jar, but I probably wouldn't order again.

The Fairfax: scrambled eggs, carmelized onions, cheddar, chives and sriracha mayo sandwiched in a soft brioche bun.
I believe this is the best egg sandwich Egglsut offers. Can be a bit messy to eat, but they serve it with a fork for a reason.
.
Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich: Hardwood smoked bacon, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and chipotle ketchup in a warm brioche bun.
Just a basic breakfast sandwich, nothing extraordinary about it. 

Salted chocolate chip cookie: Dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt.
Nice combination of crunchy, sweet, and salty. Not worth $4.50, but a decent choice if you need a sweet bite after your meal.

*Buy your drinks elsewhere. Their cups are TINY."}
{"text":"This place had a bit of a line, but it was amazing. I had the Gaucho sandwich and it was spectacular. The flavor and textures were so good. Boyfriend had the Slut and he raved about it. Perfect spot when you have a some time and want some good breakfast/brunch food."}
{"text":"The greatest. Period. We love this place! Fairfax with avocado & bacon is the way to go. Extra sauce also makes life decadent. So delicious & staying at the cosmopolitan we ate here almost daily! Fresh brioche & line keeps moving all freaking day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I waited for about 15-20 mins until it was our turn to order. We read all the reviews, so it got us questioning \"what the hype was about?\" Thankfully, the wait was well-worth it because it was delicious! I had the Fairfax w/ bacon and he had the Gaucho. We both enjoyed every bite of it :) Thanks, Eggslut!!"}
{"text":"I love their Fairfax sandwich. It's filled with so much goodness: eggs, sriracha mayo, chives, and caramelized onions. So delicious!! I wish Eggslut were open later so I could go there for a late night snack or dinner. I guess the only bad part is that the food falls out of the sandwich. But, it falls out because there are so many good ingredients in the sandwich - so the con definitely outweighs the pro for me!

Affordable prices. Sometimes, there's a long line. I only waited 5 minutes to get served. The service has always been very friendly.  There are tables to sit at or you can take it to go. I wish I could make an egg sandwich like this! I can't wait to go back and eat another Fairfax."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a breakfast place, the slut* was a masterpiece and the sandwich was delicious  I will definitely come back for this food"}
{"text":"Normally don't write too many reviews, but saw too many hater posts not to review!!

I had the Fairfax with Bacon, a Salted Dark Chocolate Chip Cookie AND a Biscuit!! I was all great!!!!!

The only reason not 5 is because I'm a bread head and while the biscuit was good, it needed to be heated just a tad more so the butter could easily be spread! But other than that KUDOS!!! :))

Had about a 30 min wait around 12:15PM. Will def go back!!!"}
{"text":"Waited about 40 minutes at 9:30 on a Saturday morning. I would go again but wouldn't wait that long ever again, as the food wasn't that special.

The slut reminded me off baby food and was massively underwhelming for their \"speciality\". However the fairfax w/ avacado was redeeming although it was a bit cold."}
{"text":"Pretty good egg sandwiches. Be prepared to wait in line.. wouldn't say the best sandwiches in the world but they are good if you're hungry..."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE THING TO EAT IN VEGAS!

When we stay at the Cosmo, we eat eggslut at least twice in the span of a few days (usually drunk too so during ungodly hours of the AM). Being an egg fanatic plays a role but something about that sausage, egg and cheese combination with a warm toasted bun - sigh. It just warms my heart thinking about it. Delicious. I've tried the Fairfax, egg salad sandwich, etc. The slut may be an acquired taste at first but just make sure it's mixed completely! Definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed. 

So conveniently located as well since we always stay at the Cosmo.

Forget the LA location (which sucks), forget the Vegas buffets, I'm staying loyal to this Eggslut right here."}
{"text":"Went here expecting just a so-so egg sandwich but boy was I proven wrong. Got the Fairfax with added bacon and it was AMAZING. The bread, the sauce, the eggs, all of it was a wonderful combination. Highly recommend!!! Only downside is you have to wait in line which can get lengthy, but it moves decently. Definitely try this place out if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out and I can see why there's so much hype around it but it doesn't do much for me. Avoid the lines by going mid afternoon after 2pm. It's Vegas so you should be just getting up around that time anyway. It'll hit the spot if you're looking for a greasy breakfast sandwich and fresh oj but I'd rather go to a mom and pop breakfast place any day."}
{"text":"Delicious. You should expect a line when you get here, but it moves quickly and is worth the wait. Try the orange juice and the biscuits!"}
{"text":"To compare this food to a theme park food is realistic. It's over priced and salty. $4 for a 20oz bottle of smart water and $4.50 for a 10oz cup of simple coffee? Not even Starbucks charges that much. They make the food prior to you ordering it and just assemble it up request so you get a rather cold breakfast sandwich. Totally not worth it. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. Seriously, I could have paid a fraction of the price for something similar at a donut shop. The only difference is the ciabatta bun and sauce they put on it, which wasn't anything special. I think the worst part of my experience was my husbands sandwich. He ordered the Fairfax sandwich. First thing he noticed was a big fat hair sticking out of his sandwich. I went to the cashier and requested a fresh sandwich. She literally turned around another premade sandwich. So, no I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I loved The Slut! Who would've thought that an over medium egg and puréed potatoes (AKA mashed potatoes) would pair so well together?!  The 20 min line was well worth it. The (turkey) sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich was amazing too. The chipotle mayo was perfect along with the brioche bun. I would definitely recommend this place, but order 1-2 items as 1 probably won't be enough."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place,
but the one in Los Angeles, specifically, since I'm from San Diego,
but since this was convenient when visiting Las Vegas, we gave it a try.


Fairfax Sandwich
(scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo, brioche bun)
Added avocado for an extra $2
The bread was good, not too soft or hard,
the scrambled eggs were fluffy,
good amount of avocados,
very subtle flavor.

Overall, it was good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"This place was definitely hype.  My sandwich was decent but I have had better.  There are too few seats and the coffee was really less than average.  I wish I had picked a real restaurant to have breakfast in instead of spending a fortune on a fancy McDonalds."}
{"text":"Pretty bland. Not amazing. Not terrible. Long wait for a small expensive meal that wasn't mind blowing. Not really worth the wait but it's an experience I guess."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Eggslut in LA, but have been super turned off by the lines. So, while in Vegas, decided to give it a try. It was everything I was hoping it would be- a messy, flavorful, taste of heaven. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich (without the chipotle ketchup). It was filling and absolutely worth trying."}
{"text":"As the name suggests this place has a menu dedicated to eggs. My first two visits were after drunken nights downtown. Both times I came around 3am. At 3am there's a line. Eggslut Las Vegas is located in the Cosmo on the second floor across from Marquee, hence the line at 3am on Sunday morning. Third visit was on Christmas day. It was pretty busy and food quality definitely decreased. 

You have to order The Slut if you come to Eggslut! Its my favorite item on the menu. Prior to going I had no idea it has mashed potatoes in it. They give you a good amount of bread with it but feel free to ask for more. I usually order the Fairfax sandwich and add bacon. Ive also tried their biscuit. 

Overall if you'd rather have a super early breakfast after a night out in Vegas over Secret Pizza then why not give Eggslut a try. Better as drunchie food versus hangover food lol"}
{"text":"I wanted to see for myself what the hype was about and with a name like \"EggSlut\" how can one not be intrigued. Who am I kidding I've been dying literally dying to try EggSlut since before I even knew we were getting one here in Vegas and somehow my dreams came true. 

Conveniently located inside of the Cosmopolitan, EggSlut has found it's home and in opinion there is no other better place for it to be then there. Ok with much anticipations I came before a concert with a hunger and a mission. With the Slut in mind I didn't realized that they run out in the mornings with those. So we ordered the sausage, egg and cheese and the burger sandwiches. To soon I got the cold brew which was amazing I added cream and sugar. 

The prices were a bit step but to my surprise the sandwiches were actually quit big. They both came on their signature Brioche buns that was warm and toasty, slightly buttery and very good. The chicken Sausage was juicy and yummy. Topped with cheddar cheese and the runniest egg and a little bit if aoli or some sort of mayo it was the perfect sandwich. The burger was delish with a super juicy patty and sweet pickles to break up all the savory. It was a tasty surprise. 

All in all it was good, filling and you gotta love the branding. I will probably come back for the \"Slut\" which I didn't get to try but I don't know if I can pay the price on a daily. $30 something for 2 breakfast sandwiches and a ice coffee is pretty hefty for my budget. Regardless I'm a fan and I would definitely tell people that's it's worth it."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in their customer service. Contacted them a month ago and i was ignored.its been almost two months and no one has contacted me"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place and people said it was a \"must try\" sorta spot so decided to check it out w the bf since it was conveniently located inside the hotel we were staying at. We got there around 10am and there was a long line. It moved kinda fast though. We got to the front maybe 35 mins later. We got the..

Sausage, egg & cheese sandwich - $8.50
Cheeseburger (added bacon) - $13.50
Gaucho sandwich - $15
Slut - $10.50

When we picked up our food, the lady asked if it was our first time. For the \"slut,\" she told us to break the yolk and mix it around. This particular item was pretty good & unique (coddled egg, potato puree, chives & gray salt) but I felt like the other items were just average tasting. There was nothing special about the sandwiches & burger. Service and everything was fine but pretty pricey and a bit overrated in my opinion."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich was good but had to wait far too long to get it. When I asked for a cup of WATER the person at the sandwich delivery counter said \"WE ONLY HAVE BOTTLED WATER HERE\"!! REALLY? What kind of food service facility would ask you to choke your food down or pay outrageous prices for bottled water? Only the SLUTTY KIND!"}
{"text":"Couldn't take better advantage of staying at the cosmo then going to eggslut for brunch! Originally discovered in San Francisco as a food truck, this place went big for its Breakfast sandwiches. Located on the 3rd floor of the cosmo, there was a huge line up- 15 min wait, but the line moved quickly. I ordered the fairfax sandwich (5/5 Chipotle mayo, carmelized onions, cheddar cheese and fluffy scrambled eggs served in between brioche buns) I ordered extra avocado to come with- really adds a nice buttery context without the fat. The sandwich was not too heavy- it was perfect actually, eggs were light and the Chipotle mayo was a fine touch. They serve freshly squeezed organ juice as well. My order came out to around 17$. 
Worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new breakfast digs here at Cosmo. The line backed around the corner but only took about 10 minutes, not bad for fresh made orders. I ordered the Eggslut*, which is the house special. Came across salty like a slut... was that the intent? ;-0 I couldn't eat it and changed it out for the egg sandwich!!  This place has all the hype and a bit much for the bang. To be honest, check out the Va Bene (in Cosmo) pesto egg sandwich! It's the bomb!!"}
{"text":"If you from east coast you need to try this. This is truly west coast eats. The sandwich i ordered was the fairfax and i added turkey sausage and avocado to my sandwich for an additional $5. The sandwiches are little in size however the taste is out of this world. The sandwich is made right in front of you and done in 5 mins.  No long lines. Great flavor. Organized clean location. Id order two to really be filled if you are very hungry. They dont have any fries or side orders at this place. Overall spent $14.61 for this."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the Cosmopolitan. Came here for breakfast and wasn't that hungry but I wanted to try it after friends telling me how great it was. Ordered the Gaucho and was so glad i did. Probably the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. The place is small so it builds a line quickly, so don't be shocked when you see the line wrapped around the corner."}
{"text":"Scrumptious!!! I had the fairfax breakfast sandwich with avocado and it was delicious! Husby had the gaucho which was also really yummy but was much heavier. Minus 1 star for the not so fluffy/mediocre biscuit."}
{"text":"I crave this now!!! The scrambled eggs are like anything I've ever tasted. The eggs are so creamy and not eggy. Well worth the wait in line"}
{"text":"After over 1,000 miles of driving, over 55 miles of hiking with over 30lb of weight over my back it feel so good to be able to some food other than Freeze dry food from Mountain House.  Eggslut is the place to go if you are near Cosmo!"}
{"text":"Not bad per se, but underwhelming after hearing all the hype. Line up was about 20 mins around lunch time on a weekday. My bacon egg cheese sandwich tasted predominantly of ketchup. The egg yolk was pretty much entirely absorbed into the wrapper instead of into my mouth."}
{"text":"YUM. Get the Fairfax and the Slut for SURE. We tried the burger this time and that was good also.

There will definitely be a line so if you're not in the mood to wait 30-45 minutes around brunch/lunch time try 3:00 pm...or 3:00 am =P"}
{"text":"The line was incredibly long but the food was honestly amazing. I got the normal egg sandwich and I can probably never have a normal egg sandwich again haha! Unfortunately my boyfriend didn't have that experience he got the gancho (?) sandwich and after about half there was no more yolk and it was bland but then the orange was amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try the food but the location in downtown Los Angeles always has a long line. It was my lucky day because this location didn't have anyone in line. I ordered the cheeseburger sandwich, it took about 5 minutes to get my food. Once I took a look at my sandwich I knew I would enjoy it, the first bite had me in heaven, really good food. Now I want to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Great breakfast - quick and good. Line was long but worth the wait. Reasonably priced for a breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"The fair fax sandwhich was amazing. The eggs just melts in your mouth. The chives were a nice touch to the eggs. It was the sluttest eggs around . The cheese, caramelized onions with Sriracha mayo on that brioche bun were delicious additions. The line moves rather quickly. The wait time for the food isn't long about 3-5 minutes. Definitely a spot to go back for more"}
{"text":"Super delish! Wish it had bigger portions but it's just enough to get you through the day. Def will be recommending this place to anyone that comes to Vegas. The eggslut was really good but the gaucho with that wagyu tri-tip steak, that's where it's at!"}
{"text":"If you like fast food without the fast food taste this is the spot!  Delicious breakfast sandwiches.  Prompt and courteous service.  I would give it 5 stars if they had more items on the menu but then again that's probably what makes it great!"}
{"text":"The best egg sandwich I've ever had. Get the turkey sausage in there as well, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I found out there was an Egg Slut in cosmo! We went there before heading to a day party at Marquee. The wait was longer than I expected even though the line was not THAT long. They take a while to make your food. The food is above average but not as great as I was expecting based on all the good things I had heard about the place. I guess it's overhyped. 

\"The Slut\"- It has a cage free poached egg on potato puree. It's served in a glass jar, topped with chives, and comes with slices of baguette bread.  It was good, but I wish the potato puree had more flavor to it. Could've used a tad more salt. 

Sausage, Egg, Cheese sandwich - the sausage is a turkey sausage. Meh. Would be better if it was juicy pork. Haha. It includes an over medium egg on a warm brioche bun. Decent breakfast sandwich but nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"waited in line for 30 minutes to get my slut , biscuit with honey and fresh OJ.. WORTH IT!  every thing tasted great, eggs were cooked to perfection,  Mashed potatoes were creamy , the biscuits were fresh and warm and the honey butter was to die for.

 Please open one in  SEATTLE!"}
{"text":"Very good egg sandwich. Line was about 40 mins long  a bit much for me. Coffee was very good as well. Thank goodness everyone enjoyed breakfast otherwise I would've been in trouble...."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the sandwich was great! I'm not the biggest fan of orange juice but I went out on a limb and ordered it here. Definitely a must have if you like orange juice. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast here right before Christmas. The wait was like half an hour until we got the order. We had two sluts and one orange juice. The sluts tasted good, especially when paired with the bread. The orange juice was overrated. 4 stars for the taste and 1 star for creativity."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was extremely excited about coming to Eggslut to eat because I never got to go to their location in LA. I am glad I finally went to one, as I would assume that the LA is the same quality, if not better if possible.

I had a great breakfast sandwich. The bread was toasted well. The eggs were nice and fluffy. The cheese was ooey and gooey! They were generous with the bacon and seemed like it was cooked with expertise. I am a fan of black coffee, so I enjoyed their cold brew.

This place fits the aesthetic of Cosmopolitan. The whole place is visually appealing. 

I had a very good experience at Eggslut. I will be coming here for more breakfast food if I ever find myself on the strip in the morning!"}
{"text":"Yea.. I mean its a 30 min wait for an egg sandwich...

Nothing impressive. Heard people raving about this place so had to give it a try. Great hangover food, decently filling egg sandwich.. but at the end of the day it is nothing impressive. Be aware limited seating on busy mornings. Not great food to eat and walk around, kind of messy. Worth a try for a quick breakfast if you are staying at the cosmo, but if your gonna commute to this place, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"If you're not already familiar with the brand, you're in for a treat.. as long as you're also willing to brave the inevitable line that comes with it. The long wait to order combined with the pricey menu are the only thing holding me back from awarding that #5 star, but as far as their fare is concerned- 5 star all the way! They also do not have complimentary water; I offset the cost by bringing my own drink so I can't speak to their OJ, but it's very popular. 

My boo and I have tried their classic bacon sandwich and the Fairfax, which I now prefer to order with the mayo spread on the side as it can sometimes have too much, overpowering the delicate chives and tender eggs. Avocado is available for sandwiches, but with their perfectly soft scrambled, cheesy eggs I didn't really think it needed another creamy element. The indulgently buttery bread supports the sandwich perfectly and may be the best part in my opinion, but I think next time I am going to try their signature \"Slut\" to mix it up! 

This location is in the Cosmopolitan; walking through the main doors of the Strip, head towards the right staircase and find it on the second floor, near what I can only describe as the back side chandelier bar. If you're parked in their garage, no worries, it will be down a hallway after you exit the elevator on the second floor.. as a matter of fact, you'll know you're in the right place when you see their wraparound line first!"}
{"text":"Food was FRESH and delicious. Try the Slut with a side of bacon....it was so delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Just shut up and take my money! Eggslut was soo soo good. Luckily there was no line when we went but mind you we came around 4:30pm on Saturday. The fairfax was an awesome sandwich. Add a side of bacon to make it even better."}
{"text":"There was a very long line, but it's totally worth it. I got a chance to converse with some of the people. The staff is extremely friendly and down to earth. Management is definitely hiring the right people. 

The product is also solid. You can immediately tell by looking at the buns that the sandwich will not fail. The buns are the perfect brown and oh so soft. The eggs are fluffy, creamy, and tasty - the way they should be. 

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with sausage, a great decision. At first I was afraid that the sauce would throw me off. But I was surprised in a good way. The risk proved to deliver a high reward. 

This place is definitely doing everything right. I just wish there was one back at home :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Perfect. Now if only they can open one in NY. The glass jar that contains the egg and potatoes is adorable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Out of everything I had there, my favorite was the Slut. Everything I like in one jar. Seasoned perfectly smoothed and creamy with that toasted garlic bread it was amazing! My fiancé came to eat here twice because he liked it so much!"}
{"text":"Long line but worth it. Tried the Eggslut. Not a fan of the mashed potato while others raved about it, but the egg is cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Enjoyed learning about  the companies beginnings as food truck in LA, on Cosmopolitans room channel, so was our first choice for breakfast.  We got here around 1pm a bit of a line but it moved fast.   We noticed not much seating in the place itself, so I went and found a couch to sit on near the bar.  I got the Sausage, egg and cheese sandwich with a orange juice and my husband got the Bacon, egg and cheese, orange juice and a cookie. Juice was cool and fresh.  I enjoyed my husbands sandwich more than mine.  Chocolate cookie was divine."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much, but it was just okay.
It was good, but I don't know the unique taste, and a long line, and long wait for the food.

Food: Good
Price: Avg
Service: Good
Parking: N/A, parked at Planet Hollywood"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Cosmopolitan and ate here for breakfast two mornings. We split a sandwich between two people. It was a perfect size for a quick lite breakfast on the go. We tried the Fairfax with bacon (my favorite) and the bacon egg and cheese (a little spicy for me). Line was only a few people deep around 9 am. Cold brew coffee was decent. I give 4 stars because I expected it to be a little faster- ordering takes time because everyone pays with a card and the cashier makes your drink. Sandwiches take a minute even though the cooks are constantly on the grill. Overall, we were pleased to have this on the go option at our hotel."}
{"text":"What a simple but tasty menu! I strongly recommend this as a go to spot!! I was very surprised at how good t was, but if you are hungry one sandwich just might not be enough to satisfy you. The lines are nuts, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place, because it took us 40 minutes to get through the line and it's pricey for what it is...but those sandwiches are so damn GOOD!

My girlfriend and I both got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. We wanted to also get a \"slut\" and share it (or her or him?), but they were OUT! Bummer.

Either way, the sandwich was great! It's so simple, but the brioche bun is so tasty and warm, the bacon is so crispy the egg is just right and the ketchup ties it all together. Loved it! Just wish I had gotten two.

We also got the biscuit. It's $5 for an ordinary size biscuit...so I wasn't too excited at first. However, it's really buttery on the inside, and the sweet butter they serve with it is divine! Maybe it is worth the $5...

Overall, a great breakfast/brunch stop if you're not looking for anything too fancy. Just be prepared to wait! Would stop here again."}
{"text":"Incredibly good. The wait is pretty long though, but worth the wait. It's pretty pricey for the size though. he size isn't that big which is sad, so it wasn't filling with just one. Got the cheeseburger and it was incredibly juicy and the egg paired well with it. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"While the menu isn't huge, but the food was amazing and fresh. I wasn't craving an egg sandwich, but went ahead and tried it. It was cool!"}
{"text":"It was an okay egg sandwich. The line makes it appear fantastic.  Don't expect too much  just food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This place lived up to every hype, and I wish I could have an Eggslut breakfast sandwich every day of my life! The line looks daunting, but it was only about 30 minutes for us. The time in line gave us a chance to talk and catch up, as it was the first place we went after arriving in Vegas! I got the egg salad sandwich and added bacon to it! The extra surcharge was completely worth it. Plus, I was full for hours and didn't feel hungry again until dinner (which is always a 'plus' in Vegas with how expensive everything is). I have been telling everyone I know about this place, and I cannot wait to go back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for great breakfast, & it's rare I find a place that can make breaky better than me :) But man, eggslut does it UP! I highly recommend the classic \"slut\". I am definitely going to try to recreate this at home. A poached egg floating inside of the creamiest whipped potatoes I've ever laid tongue on. Served with baguette. The line moves fast, & this seems to be pretty unanimous opinion among other yelpers. The coffee is actually outstanding, and dont skip the cookie or the biscuit with honey butter either. The breakfast sandwich was also baller. I recommend to a friend. :)"}
{"text":"Great place, where there's almost always a line.  On a recent trip to Vegas, we decided to go to Eggslut in The Cosmopolitan at around 8 am (very early for Las Vegas, yes!)... and magically there was no line.  Stepped right up, ordered... it was quick and delicious.  I love that their eggs are cage-free.

I'm not even a huge egg sandwich type fan, but the one I got (bacon, egg & cheese) was literally the best breakfast sandwich I've ever eaten.  The brioche bun was super soft and flavorable, the hardwood smoked bacon was perfectly crispy, egg expertly done, and the chipotle ketchup (which didn't sound great to me at first) was amazingly tangy.  It all worked so well together.

I totally understand why there's usually a line out the store here.  It's well worth it... and downright cheap and inexpensive by Vegas standards.  I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"The turkey sausage, cheese, and egg was tasty.  Brioche bun was super soft!  Breakfast sandwich was good, but I'm from New Orleans and my taste buds need a kick...some spice of hot sauce or a sausage with a kick.  The fresh orange juice was delicious, but not worth $5.  Line moved quickly took about 15 minutes and they played some old school rap so the time flew by.  Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Not a sit down restaurant. Line is usually wrapped around the place but it goes quick. Prepare to wait a little bit. There is open seating all around. Not the friendliest cashier but who cares. I got the sausage, egg, & cheese sandwich. Turkey sausage with medium egg and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun with honey mustard aioli sauce. It was sooooo good."}
{"text":"No idea where all these terrible reviews keep coming from?! 
I almost didn't go because of how many people complained, but I'm really glad I did.

Disregard all previous reviews, I will give you reality. 

This place is fantastic! Perfect for weekend late night! 

The sandwich I had was the cheese, egg, bacon. 

It was delicious, and loaded with bacon. 
The egg was cooked perfectly, and the bun was soft and fluffy. 

The customer service was friendly, and I was greeted with a smile! 

The prices are a bit steep, but cmon man... you're in Las Vegas, on the strip, and in the Cosmo. 
Next door are $6 tacos, I think we can all afford to shell out $8 for a damn good egg sandwich! 

GET THAT EGG SANDWICH AND THANK ALVIN FOR BLESSING US WITH HIS CREATIONS IN VEGAS."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, always try new food! Kudos to my colleague who found this little gem in the Cosmopolitan. The bread is delivered fresh every morning and all of the ingredients are made fresh. Compared to other \"sausage, egg, cheese\" sandwiches? Doesn't come close. Every bite was succulent and rich, hell, the line wasn't too long either. The service was fast. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Good, but over hyped in my opinion. They didn't have the salad option due to being out of Arugula, which, I get it that happens. My sandwhich was meh, coffee sizes are small for what you pay. Husband's sandwhich was much better than mine. Customer service kind of had the attitude of we know we're hot right now and don't need to go above and beyond. Not rude, just nothing special. There is a line to order and a wait for food, but we weren't in a hurry so that wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Meh. While their goods are high quality. It remains a bit to be desired. 

We were able to try their famous eggslut, the cookie, and 2 of their sandwiches: sausage egg and cheese + egg salad sandwich. Flavors were good but nothing to be excited about. Nothing too extravagant and something you can make at home more less than a quarter of the price. 

I suppose the hype was how simple it was. However an $8 breakfast sandwich? No thanks. I will say the Eggslut was a nice take on the poached side of the egg. Cooked sous vide, it was delicate and fresh. But again, for $10? No thanks. 

The wait times for our food remained long. However, it is understandable since they cook every one to order. Still, nearly 20 minutes for a few orders is really pushing it. 

Overall just ok, but go elsewhere if you're looking for a cheap and quick breakfast."}
{"text":"The line is very long, and the egg slut is a good idea but I felt it tasted a bit too salty. The glorified egg mcmuffin is tasty due to their special sauce, but the sausage patty was very thin and disappointing. I didn't taste much egg given the status and hype of eggslut."}
{"text":"When your claim to fame is egg slut and your biscuit is on point there are issues.  The gaucho sandwich lacked flavor on the meat.  The egg slut was underwhelming.  You better off going to Mickey Ds down the road."}
{"text":"Completely amazing!!!! I had a slut and my husband had a Fairfax add avocado and bacon. We are back again to have a couple more sluts. This time there's a hella long line but still worth the wait. Only complaint is the drinks are small and $5 so BYOB

Back again for a 3rd visit and had a Slut and a Gaucho and an arugula salad. Gaucho is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Got here at 7:08 and waited about 25 mins. We got the bacon egg and cheese, the slut, a biscuit, oj and ice coffee. $40. Ugh Vegas prices. The slut was so good, but I could make it at home for like &2 versus $10. I appreciate the inspiration, it's going down next weekend. The bec was good not my fav but I don't like them that much anyway but my hubby does and he enjoyed it. The biscuit was decent better than most but not as good as homemade. Oj was great. I left happy with having eaten there but it would have gotten 5 stars if it were about half the price."}
{"text":"So excited that eggslut is finally in Vegas, no need for LA trips any longer. By far the best egg sandwich I've had, \"fairfax\" and the \"gaucho\" are my top favorites."}
{"text":"During EDC week, I came twice. Not sure what the wait is usually, but the two times, I waited about 20-30 minutes. 

THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT.

I had the Slut both times. Mashed potatoes and egg.... Then dipping it with bread. O M G. 

I'm stoked to come back when I'm here again!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of breakfast so I can't help but be biased. My friend recommended this place for us to eat breakfast at while on our vacation in Vegas. When we got here, oh man what time was it. I want to say it was around 11am, we waited in line about 30 minutes. The line wrapped around all the way down the hallway. Halfway through the line, someone came out saying that the slut would not be ready for another 45 minutes which was fine because we didn't want the slut. 

We ordered a bacon egg sandwich, 2 sausage egg sandwich, fairway sandwich, and the gaucho sandwich. The bacon sandwich was good, bacon was nice and crispy and full of flavor, however, the egg was overcooked so the yolk was not runny at all. The sausage sandwich was good as well. The sausage was a little bland and dry but the egg was nice and runny. The steak in the gaucho sandwich was delicious. It was a nice medium rare consistency and had great flavor. As a sandwich though, it didn't really tie well together but the steak by itself was delicious. The fairway sandwich was okay as well. It was scrambled eggs instead of a full egg. I felt that it was way too mushy and wet and didn't really have much flavor. 

Again, I'm not a breakfast person so I'm a little biased. This place is over hyped for me. Food is not that great and it was expensive for a breakfast sandwich the size of your palm. My other friends seemed to like it but again, the eggs on all of the sandwiches weren't very consistent. One was over cooked, another was too runny and another was fine. 

Food is okay, service is fine considering you order at a counter and then pick up the order at a counter. Seems to be really popular so beat the crowd at a less popuilar time or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Really great food but also long lines and on the pricier side. Being from manhattan, the price is comparable to what I'm used to, but I can see how other people could be deterred by it. $8 breakfast sandwiches and $5 regular coffee. However, the sandwiches are delicious and fresh and while you wait in line you get to listen to old school hip hop and rap and watch them make your food (which is impressive). Also really good fresh squeezed oj. Fun experience overall and great breakfast if you have a few extra minutes and are willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"The slut: creamy mashed potatoes and sous vide egg cooked in a mason jar topped with fresh chives and grey salt. Simple, but it was so delicious! The toasted baguette it came with for dipping through the egg was brushed with a very fragrant olive oil. The whole thing was simply perfection. Of course I wish the line was not so long and the self seating area is definitely lacking. But the wait is definitely worth it for that slut!"}
{"text":"Worst place in Vegas they ran out of the best sandwich on the menu. If you want to drink water, instead of coffee or juice, you have to buy it or go to the next store and buy it cheaper. Also, there is no place to sit. You have to go to the bar next to them to find a seat. Those guys are not prepared for Vegas. More like Ehhslut."}
{"text":"First off this place is extremely busy.... But oh so worth the wait! This is an amazing breakfast spot or could even be an afternoon snack! When visiting Las Vegas make sure you get in line and wait your turn, You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"By far the best egg sandwhiches ive ever had. For any foodie that loves trying new places I recommend this spot. I can't get over how delicious and satisfying the sandwhiches are. I feel like im floating on a cloud with each bite I take. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"The line was long. A 25 min wait just to order.  It's like a factory that churns out mediocre overpriced dishes. 

I ordered the slut. A poached egg in a cup over mashed potatoes. It was the consistency of a loogie. 

My friend got one of their sandwiches and a biscuit. The thing was dryer than than senior citizen cooch. I mean, you can always lube it up with their sample size honey butter they give you. 

I had ordered their \"fresh squeezed orange juice\" but when I was handed a cup that looked like it was from concentrate and asked about it being advertised as fresh squeezed, the response I got from the man behind the counter was....\"we don't squeeze it here, somebody else somewhere else squeezed it. You know, like it says on the bottle 'fresh squeezed'. Tacky ass false advertising. 

I'm giving it three stars for the flavor of the loogie and the originality of the idea. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:30 am on a  Sunday to find the line wrapped around the corner of the restaurant.  I was surprised to see so many people as 8:30 is early for Vegas...

We ordered bacon egg and cheese, the Slut and a biscuit with honey butter.   At $39 a little pricey for the portions, but it's OH SO WORTH IT! 

I dont know who decided to mix mashed potatoes with a runny egg, but they're GENIUS!"}
{"text":"This place has solid food.  I like the brioche buns, it always makes any sandwich or burger better.  I preferred the breakfast here versus the other options near the Cosmo.  It was tasty but I can see why some would not be impressed.  People line up and runaway with several sandwiches like it's gold.  I enjoyed my breakfast sandwiches, but if I didn't come right before opening, I doubt I would wait long for the sandwiches.  It's good, but not wait in line for 30 minutes good."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here while I was in town from jersey and it was sooo delicious I got my breakfast sandwich accompanied by a salad and everything was super fresh ... which they had more locations YUM"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try Eggslut. I live in Los Angeles and there is a location there as well that is close to my work. I have heard incredible things about it from people who I work with. Although, I never got a chance to try EggSlut in LA - I was definitely very excited to try it the next morning while me and my fiancé were staying at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. We were looking to grab something on the go. We stopped at Va Bene (review below) for coffee and then we headed to Eggslut to brave the line for some to-go sandwiches. Every time I ever passed EggSlut, no matter if it was morning noon or late night, there was always a line wrapped around the place. Probably the reason I have never tried it. My fiancé and I strategically woke up early one Monday morning knowing that the weekend rush may have subsided, and to our satisfaction - we did not have to wait in line at all. We went right up to the register and ordered a sausage egg and cheese sandwich for me and bacon egg and cheese sandwich for my fiancé. I was trying to make small talk with the girl at the register, but she wasn't really having it. In her defense she did say that she had worked the overnight shift and that they are busiest overnight from the people getting out of the club next-door. We put in our order and had probably less than a five minute wait. The place was busy, but not so busy that we weren't able to get quick service. We took our sandwiches to go and headed upstairs to our balcony suite to enjoy them. Or so we thought. The expectations were so high about this place because I've heard about it for years and never tried it, plus the fact that we were both starving - I had to remind myself to lower my expectations in order to enjoy it. They were served in a cute little to-go box, (photographed below.) we were very much looking forward to taking a bite. My first bite, egg yolk splashed everywhere. I found it to be quite ironic because of the name. Also photographed below. To both of our dissatisfaction, our sandwiches were terrible. I know, that is probably not the direction you saw the story going. My sausage, was so hard - I could barely get my teeth through it. I took one bite and then tossed it to the side. The bread was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly, but that sausage literally and figuratively put a bad taste in my mouth. Also, my fiancé does not like ketchup and there was ketchup all over his sandwich. In what world does a sandwich come with ketchup already on it? We were both disgusted and it killed our appetites for the entire day. That pissed me off because I really love Las Vegas dining and we were so excited to try this place. Pure dissatisfaction. If you have to satisfy the urge to try this place because of the hype, do go ahead but go on an off day so you don't have to wait in line. I think you would be more pissed off if you waited in a long line for that gross sandwich."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas outpost is equally as good as the LA one!! It also comes with the enormous line you find at the LA location! So know that going in, you will have to wait a bit. They do have the system down pretty good so it moves fairly quickly. I got the fair fax and my friends got some other breakfast sandwiches too. The fair fax is truly incredible. Seriously great flavor and so filling and delicious. I think the secret might be in that brioche bun. Man it is good. I highly recommend coming here when in Vegas for breakfast or an egg sandwich later in the day if that's your jam."}
{"text":"This restaurant stands to its name and ratings. We ordered egg bacon sandwich and slut. The sandwich was outstanding. The best egg sandwich I ever have had for breakfast. Slut is an unique concept with smashed potato mixed with egg but truly an amazing experience to eat. Enjoyed every bit of it. If u plan to go in morning hours then be ready to wait for may be 30 mins but worth it!!!

Highly recommended!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gonna keep this review short & straight to the point.
Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan Casino on the second floor. Take this review with a grain of salt as I don't eat eggs. I did however eat a really tasty biscuit & a burger sans the egg. 

Be prepared to wait upwards of 30-45 minutes standing in line. The good news is there is a bathroom right next to the hallway where the line forms. Seating will come at a premium also as there aren't many chairs. As you get to order, if you're with someone, have them go grab seats so you can grub when your food is ready. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in LA and now here as well and both locations are just as great. Although it can be a little expensive but when you're on vacation it's okay to splurge a little. I may have paid for overpriced foods but their sandwiches are very good! I like the fairfax one but this time I tried their bacon, egg & cheese sandwich and it was just as good! Now I would say the orange juice is just average. They really do overpriced their beverages though. Seriously I pad 5 dollars for my orange juice so I expect it to be a decent size... a little disappointed when he gave me a small. I guess there was just one size?? Anyways if I am ever in Vegas again definitely would stop by again for the foods. 

Ps. Bring your own drinks. Seriously, they really do jack you off for a small drink..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty standard for a breakfast/brunch joint. With the menu being so small everything is made to order expect for the sluts (eggs and mashed potatoes in a jar) because they take longer to prep. If you're an egg lover, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"**EGGSLUT** is a trendy eatery that is finally in Vegas after its original LA location.~ 

-have patience: long line with 40 minute wait [keep in mind this just opened over a week ago]
-fun and fresh appeal.. neat concept located inside *The Cosmopolitan*
-simple and enticing menu with reasonable pricing
-friendly cashier Mason!
-view of kitchen and Eggslut process with Chefs hustling those grills 
-perfect for Egg lovers, neat themed decor all around
-smaller restaurant, similar to a fast food place, but food made fresh 
-limited seating 
-great Fairfax Sandwich: savory & messy.. comes with a helpful fork (soft scrambled eggs, chives, cheddar, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in warm brioche bun)

Overall, this place hits the spot. =]]"}
{"text":"Eggslut is located on the 2nd Floor at the Cosmopolitan. One of the few breakfast choices in the hotel. If you are a Eggslut fan then you're happy that they arrived in Vegas. The quality of the sandwiches are as good as in L.A. The popularity of Eggslut does create long lines so prepare yourself for the wait."}
{"text":"We tried the two breakfast sandwiches and the \"slut\", which took the cake for me. The egg was cooked to perfect and mixed together with the mashed potatoes to make an exquisite topping for the baguettes. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the turkey sausage was! The line was horrendous but for good reason and moved decently fast! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow the wait for this place is crazy!  I've tried the one in LA and most recently this location, and wow.. it's like an hour wait for a breakfast sandwich!

Anyways, the first time I ate it was in LA and I tried the Fairfax sandwich, which was a soft scrambled egg, chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun.  This was very delicious and the texture of the egg was just so velvety.  I would pay $8.50 for this.

I also tried the infamous \"Slut\" which was a coddled egg over a buttery potato puree, served with bread.  Yes, this was good... BUT, how can you go wrong with buttery mashed potatoes and en egg on top though?  I wouldn't pay for this ($10.50?!)

In Vegas, I tried the Gaucho, and OMG, my opinion about this place completely changed.  It was basically seared wagyu tri-tip steak, over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun.  This is definitely a must try!!!  It was just so damn good.  It is expensive though at $15... but so worth it.

I don't know if I would wait in a hour+ line for breakfast sandwiches... but maybe next time I'll just ask some randoms at the front of the line to buy the sandwich for me and tip them... haha"}
{"text":"Eggslut is just as good as it looks! I've seen a ton of people tag this spot in their Instagram stories over the past few months and knew I had to try it for myself. You may have had a breakfast sandwich before, but not like this. After one bite, you'll understand why the line goes around the corner of the store.

When I finished my breakfast Bacon, Egg, & Cheese I really wanted another one and regretted not ordering two from the start. The \"warm brioche bun\" was actually the star of the sandwich! I don't think I've ever noticed the bun on a breakfast sandwich before, but I definitely noticed this one. It was so soft and flavorful! Can I go back to Vegas just for this sandwich?

As a midwesterner, I wish they served milk with their meals. But I guess you can't have everything. 5-Stars for the sandwich, seriously, it's that good!"}
{"text":"Can I just start by how fast the food came out!? I was impressed with the special- the slut. It was a pretty cool idea how the plate was made. There was egg and hollandaise sauce and other ingredients I'm unsure of in a little jar and there was baguette on the side. It was hands down the best egg sandwich combination I've ever had. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really good too. The sausage, egg and cheese was really good but it was a sloppy sandwich. Overall, it was an awesome experience. Hands down the best brunch place in Vegas that I've tried."}
{"text":"I was glad I had read the reviews and knew what to expect for a wait. I got in line at 11 on a Tuesday morning and it took a half hour to order. Was it worth it?  For the first time yes, but not sure I'd do it again. I loved the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit. Lots of bacon!  Also tried the biscuit and that was also good."}
{"text":"The Goods
1. It is good, egg slut is a mashed potato and poached egg dip for the pieces of toast, it is pretty yummy 
2. I love the bacon and egg sandwich !  The bread is so soft and chewy, the egg and cheese and bacon is juicy and delicious! 
3. Coffees and juices are standard...

The ambiance 
1. Limited seating
2. Mainly you will be sitting with others on a long bench table unless you take it to go.  Recommend trying to snag a seat/cushy couch associated with Cosmo somewhere nearby for more privacy
3. Cosmopolitan hotel is just one of the most dazzling and Gorgeous hotels/casino.  You'll get plenty of that 

Service 
1. Sadly never been good.  I wish it could so I could give 4/5 stars.  Lady at the counter looks upset and never smiles or even greets 
2. Guys prepping food are not that helpful either , they just gesture to other people down the line if you need something, I guess they are too busy to help. 
3. Napkins are sometimes out and the tables unclean.  

MoJo
1. If you're just prepared for \"Serve yourself\" vibe, you'll be rewarded with delicious bacon and egg sandwiches! Most people get addicted to the \"egg slut\" dish it is named after I believe.
Worth trying"}
{"text":"This place became our morning/afternoon ritual while I stayed at the Cosmopolitan one weekend. 

I've been to the one in Los Angeles so I knew the food was going to be amazing, and it is definitely less crowded. Don't get me wrong, the line still wraps around the corner (especially during peak breakfast and lunch hours) but it's much calmer and organized than LA.

They have a fairly simple menu which makes it easier to decide what you want, and honestly I think all of it is perfect hangover food in Vegas. Or the perfect meal before going out to a dayclub.

I tried both the gaucho and the cheeseburger while I was there and it was a close tie between which one I liked more. But I'd had to say try the gaucho if you get the chance. The flavor is amazing and you can't find it everywhere."}
{"text":"i definitely said to my friend \"do you want to share a slut\" whilst in line...  *awkward*

i never did drive out to la to try eggslut so i figured i'd fly to vegas instead (lol, makes a lot of sense, right?).

there was definitely a line at 12p on a saturday, but it went by fast and we were able to put our order in within 15 min.

plenty of seating, and most people really get their food to go anyways (i assume a lot of hotel guests).  now onto the food.

i got the fairfax and it was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary, and definitely not worth $8.50.  $2 to add avo was worth it because the sandwich prob would've been lackluster without it.

the slut was really good as expected, but it's just sous vide egg over reg mash potato.  the side salad was a generous pile of arugula.

overall the operation of eggslut was impressive, line moves fast, line cooks deliver fast, so definitely felt like our time was respected in that manner.  would definitely consider driving out to la now that i know what to expect."}
{"text":"We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! We ate here every single day we were in town!!! :) I am so pleased that we found a place with local farm fresh food!! The sluts were great!!! We also ordered the bacon and egg sandwich, turkey sausage sandwich, and beef sandwich with added bacon and avocado.  I chose to have salad with mine each day instead of the bread and loved it every time!!! We shared with family and they all enjoyed it also!! We brought friends along and, they too, fell in love with this place!! We always took the food to our room except for once when we ate by the chandelier.  The line can get long but it's totally worth it to try it at LEAST once!!  Our average wait time was about 20-30 mins to order but you receive your order fairly quickly so it was well worth the wait.  We will def be back next time we are in town!! :)"}
{"text":"My first tip of advice - order something in addition to the Slut and OJ. You will still be hungry (ps. I eat like the average person). The Slut was amazing! You can spread it over the baguette (you can order more baguette) and it was gooey yumminess. Be prepared to wait in line as it is a popular place. OJ is a little on the pricey side for $5, but hey, it's Vegas. After you get your Slut, you can fight for a place to sit."}
{"text":"We waited in line to order for about 30 minutes! It was well worth the wait. We got the sausage, egg and cheddar sandwich and the \"fairfax\" with bacon and avocado. 

Note: The juice in the picture is not from Eggslut"}
{"text":"Mmmm this place is a must for breakfast!!! The line can get long but it moves pretty quickly! And the food doesn't take very long either. The only issue you'll encounter here is finding a place to sit! So, you can't be a shy person, you'll probably end up right next to somebody, and yes they will be hearing your conversation. 

I had the sausage egg and cheese slut! I didn't realize the egg was going to pop as I took a bite so the yolk oozed onto my hands and legs! Lol be warned people! Sounds gross but it was amazing! The sandwich looks so simple and pretty but the flavor will literally burst in your mouth! I guess that's why this place is called eggslut... I wonder how many people's mouth they burst into everyday!! Hahahha let me stop! Just go try it already!"}
{"text":"Wishing a there was an Eggslut on the east coast! I got the Fairfax Sandwich! Probably the tastiest breakfast sandwich I've ever had. The line wrapped around the hallway and the waited for about 15-20 minutes, which just shows how how popular they are! The food is cooked to order, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Came to Eggslut on a Saturday morning ready for a hangover cure, and was not disappointed!

There was a small line, probably 20 people in front of us, but it was less than a 10 minute wait to get to the counter. There are multiple menus on the walls though, so you can decide what you want before you get there. Yay efficiency!

I ordered the bacon egg & cheese sandwich, while my friends ordered the signature Slut. We also had coffee and orange juice. Everything was just great, and price is on-point for a quick bite in Vegas (about $10 - $15 per person, depending on whether or not you get drinks). One reason I didn't get the Slut was because I was afraid the baguette would be too hard. Surprise, it isn't! I'll definitely be getting that next time.

Service was welcoming, friendly, and prompt. One of my favorite features is the open kitchen, allowing you to see everything being made fresh in front of you. 

Downside is that there isn't a lot of seating. You can find somewhere in the lobby to sit, but designated tables would be a bit better.

Eggslut is definitely someplace I'd come back to for a solid hangover breakfast!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! Best day ever - I made it to Eggslut. I was so excited when I saw that it was located INSIDE of our hotel {The Cosmopolitan} in Vegas! I've heard so much about this place and am beyond stoked to have been able to try it. Every time we walked by, regardless of the time of day, there was a HUGE line! 

When we went for breakfast/brunch around 11a, the line was SO long. We almost walked away but kept hearing that it was worth the wait and that the line went surprisingly fast. An hour later, we had an ooey, gooey, perfectly cooked egg sandwich in our hands! 

Most of us actually went with their burger because it just sounded incredible and after waiting an hour and smelling the deliciousness, we were STARVING! It had a runny egg, caramelized onions, bread and butter pickles, cheddar, dijonnaise, and a fluffy brioche bun. YES, PLEASE! The burger was legit and definitely worth the wait! If you're nearby and are contemplating the wait, JUST DO IT. You won't be disappointed and your hangover will thank you."}
{"text":"Got in like at around 9:30ish and the line went super quickly despite some of the reviews saying the lines were long, perhaps because it was thanksgiving morning, YMMV. I got the fairfax and it was amazing, the brioche bun was super good and the egg, chives and onions really meshed together well. Not a big fan of breakfast but id definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't pleased when I was starving after a grooming workout and saw that long line, but it was so worth the wait. Fresh squeezed orange juice, the creamiest eggs ever with sriracha and a perfect piece of bread...I ATE the bread and I never eat the bread! So good"}
{"text":"As good as the last time I went (LA location at the Grand Central Market). This time I heeded my own advice and ordered the same sandwich (Fairfax) but added bacon and avocado because the brioche bun literally melts in your mouth (as well as the perfectly scrambled eggs!). So glad I did and it is possibly the most delicious breakfast sandwich in the world.

I came here on a weekday (Tues) around 10am and waited about 15 minutes. The cashier is the bottleneck (they only have one) as the kitchen turned around my order very quickly. I didn't have to wait more than two minutes for them to call my name.

I'm definitely coming back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"For a place whose namesake is in eggs, eggs didn't really feel like the centerpiece of each dish.  Even in the \"slut\" dish, their specialty, the potato puree and egg in a jar didn't really emphasize the egg.  Also, it was much too salty.  It just tasted like salty potato mash, and the occasional bit of chives offset the boring flavors.  Similarly, the egg in the sandwich was super thin (which can be a good thing) but again really struck me as contradictory to the store's name.  Overall, it was definitely not worth the money I paid, considering how small the portions were and how mediocre the food was.  I was puzzled at why there was such a long wait, but I guess many people were new to it like me and were wanting to try it.  

Also, perhaps I should mention that the glass jars are the only dishes to be returned, the rest disposed.  Above the wastebasket was a platform for diners to return their glass jars.  The sign for this platform read \"We recycle our sluts. Return your glass jars here.\" (Not word for word)  I suppose this is appropriate for Las Vegas, but I'll leave it up to everyone to decide if this is funny, offensive, inappropriate for children, etc.  But I just thought I'd mention it."}
{"text":"This is such a good late night foodie spot at the Cosmo. Thank God this place opened. Eggslut isn't open late in LA but after having it in LV at 3 AM, it really should be! Their breakfast sandwiches are elite drunk post-nightclub food.

We had the chimichurri steak sandwich and the cheddar egg and bacon sandwich. The steak sandwich was good, but the egg sandwich was killer. I loved it, it was great. It makes me want to brave the long ass lines in DTLA, which luckily you won't experience here at the LV location. The lines are short and quick here! Prices are reasonable here too. Definitely check this place out for some late night or early/late morning breakfast sandwiches; they are legit."}
{"text":"It really could be better. I mean why put ketchup in an egg sandwich. Give people the option, don't just put it in there by default. I'm being very generous with 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good stuff tho it could use some flavors. Got fairfax n ibthink it had sriracha but I can swear to you I didn't even taste it. I was looking for some ketchup but couldn't find it anywhere around the store"}
{"text":"Just simply delicious!!!! Fresh and siooo good tasting. Mornings line gets long but for a day snack it's perfect and pretty fast."}
{"text":"This place was overwhelmingly average. We came after clubbing in Marquee with the drunchies. We ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese. I found the brioche bun to be overpowering and too thick. The sausage tasted like cafeteria meat. The egg was cooked right and runny, rightfully so since it is called eggslut. Also, they don't have free water and charged 4.00 for a small water bottle. Thanks Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"The slut...

The Fairfax...

Easily the best two.

I've been to the dtla location. I'm thrilled they have an outpost now in Vegas. I can get my fix in Sin City. 

The eggy goodness is alway perfect in the morning. It fills you so you can skip lunch and go straight to dinner. No regrets. 

If you're doing the Fairfax be sure to get the avocado, you can send me dollar bills in the mail as a thank you. It adds an extra layer of creamy meaty goodness. Perfectly toasted brioche. Mmmm...

The slut has wonderfully coddled eggs with perfect amount of sea salt... I could eat this every day, and never get tired. Except for the wait. I admit it gets a bit wear and tear even on a week day when it's only 30 people deep. I can't imagine the weekend or conventions when it's 150+?! Wowza! 

Noms!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place being instagrammed so many times, it's been on my devour list.  The one I always hear about is the one in LA but I made enough time to go visit so when I heard about there being one in Las Vegas, I had to try it out!

The shop is on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, near where Milk is.  There isn't much seating, so you might have to stand and eat or sit somewhere nearby. 

The most popular items are the Fairfax and the Slut. I decided to get the sausage egg and cheese one with added avocado because I didn't feel like getting scrambled eggs. 
The brioche bun was arguably the best part of the sandwich. It was toasted or pan-fried and is slight crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The other best part was the sausage! It's a little different from the ones I have had at other breakfast places. It has plenty of flavor and grease (which is great for the morning after a night out!)
I can't wait to go again and try out other items!"}
{"text":"They will ways have a little bitnof a wait. BUT everything on the menu is worth the wait. My family who was complaining about eating here while we're waiting in line but one Taste of the food it was nothing about praises that I picked this place.. you will love this place"}
{"text":"The Fairfax: flavors were there! A good sandwich. The service is not so good. The call your name out wrong method does not work in favor of the customer. Because my name was mispronounced, I was given someone else's order. When I figured this out-after taking sandwich apart- I took it back to the counter & tried to explain this to the person there. Guess what she did with the sandwich I brought back? Fixed it up & placed it back in the come get it line."}
{"text":"Ordered one of their egg sandwiches and it was delicious BUT the lines were just too long.  After waiting on long lines, I would like to at least be able to order a side with my egg sandwich but sides are not an option.  So, although my egg sandwich was absolutely scrumptious, I can't see myself standing on a 45 minute line again to order a small egg sandwich with no sides."}
{"text":"Best place for a breakfast sandwich; you know what you are in for.  No surprises, straightforward breakfast with freshly prepared eggs on the go. Hopefully management will read this, so please try to clean the big table it is always sticky and dirty.  I still return but never stay there to eat because of the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Tried the bacon egg and cheese and fairfax sandwiches, both were great. The fairfax scrambled eggs were light and the chives provided a delicate herb essence to the sandwich. My daughter had the bacon sandwich which she declared was the best egg sandwich she has ever had! She liked that the yolk was still liquid."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I am all for trying anything with eggs, and I highly recommend this! A very small menu, but with quality! I got the basic sandwhich, and the buttermilk biscuit with syrup! Both were amazing, I did try a bit of my friends meal called the Slut! Just amazing food! Worth the money and standing in line!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I had the Fairfax + Bacon. It was a decent size sandwich, and very flavorful. Not too messy as others have described, but you will need more than one napkin. This is really a 3.5 starb place, but because of the ridiculously slow and long order line (20+ mins) this place gets 3. Save your cash and grab a real bkft at Hash House..."}
{"text":"Eggslut...May be a slut, but she's not quick and easy.  The reviews hyped this place up to be something so fantastic and worth the wait.  Not worth the wait in my opinion.  This place is on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan casino.  It's a walk-up, fast food style restaurant with no seating.  The eggslut is puréed potatoes with a poached in a glass jar egg. Concept and flavor is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not worthy of being considered breakfast.  It's more of a five or six bite appetizer.  We waited in line for 45 minutes at 9:30 a.m. and then about another 10 minutes to get our eggslut jars.  Each eggslut was $10.50!! Way over priced."}
{"text":"The gaucho and biscuit were worth the money, but the egg salad was a mess and the line was a bit lengthy for what you're getting.  Also $5 cans of soda are downright obnoxious."}
{"text":"Line was long but very quick.  Employees very accommodating and they all seemed to enjoy working there.  Food came quick and VERY tasty.  Reasonably priced considering you're in Vegas!  Should open more of these in Vegas and beyond!"}
{"text":"A memorable slut!  My burger included a medium egg over easy, medium angus, caramelised onion, bread and butter pickles, dijonnaise and avocado on warm brioche.  A super burger and sandwich spot for those who love their eggies.  

There was a queue on arrival, however it only took 10 minutes to reach the front of the line.  Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Monday morning about 9am and there was a very long line which from what I hear is normal. We heard the wait would be about 30 minutes but it would be well worth the wait. After waiting for that long I have to say that I don't feel it was really worth the wait. My husband and I got the bacon breakfast sandwich and the fairfax with bacon added. Though the fairfax was tasty it had absolutely no hint of sriracha mayo as described on the menu. The bacon sandwich was good but I can't say these are incredibly great and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Vegas!
This place located in Cosmo, right across the bridge from the Planet where we stayed past Thanksgiving.
There's a pretty long line, moves fast.
All about eggs, but super tasty!!
Recommend to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Yes, the line is long but it moves quickly. It wrapped around into the hallway, but we were in line for maybe 15 minutes. I had the sausage, egg, and cheese on brioche and I loved it. The sausage was a little spicy and the egg, perfectly runny (a thicker runny which I like). By the time we were able to order, there were seats that opened up, which was good because they're limited. 

For those who haven't been, just know this is more breakfast sandwich than a sit down place with lots of options. But if you want a filling bite to eat before starting the day, this is a good place to try. It's on a floor in the Cosmopolitan which actually is like a trendy food court/alcove with all the places to eat. Yeah, it's all the rage and sometimes that ruins expectations, but I was satisfied."}
{"text":"I tried two of their sandwiches actually and they were both amazing. the first one was the turkey sausage one which tasted really really good the second one was the cheese option both were made to perfection I will definitely come back. 
The The lineup is a little long but other than that it was worth it"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast sandy (got the fairfax with sausage). The scrambled eggs are very smooth and creamy along with the bun and cheese.. everything comes together in a perfect breakfast sandwich. It has left an impression on me.. The next time I crush my normal Starbucks sausage breakfast sandwich.. I'll be entered into a dream like state of how I long for a Eggslut sandy.."}
{"text":"Hmmm I have always wanted to go to the LA location because...it's the Eggslut. Why else? I just happened to be in the area so I dropped by this location after finding out this location existed. And of course, I ordered the signature Slut!
I have been known to go all sorts of places in LA to try different interesting restaurants. Eggslut was going to be no different. Yet, it was also sort of disappointing. The slut I ordered was exceptionally salty and despite mixing it fairly well, the egg flavor stuck to the top and the bottom tasted more like the potato puree. Not very well balanced. And the salt just dehydrates you especially if you come here after clubbing at Marquee. It's a bit annoying. My friends got the burgers and were less than impressed. Would I ever go out of my way to eat here? No way.  But it was well worth trying."}
{"text":"Just what the Dr. Ordered!   

Went with the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese with a coffee.   They nailed the over medium egg, the bread was fresh with a great crust that gave that perfect crackle when you bit into it.  Bacon was delicious, its bacon, of course it was.

Great atmosphere, friendly, happy staff.  Great music!

Coffee was very good.  My only knock was it was one size coffee only, and for 7am in Vegas, it was NOT big enough.

Can't beat this place for a cheap (from Vegas standards) and delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Hmm quality over quantity prevails at eggslut, where you eat brekkie for twenty dollars for two people. I can tell this is an LA based dream put together because there are a billion places to get these sandwiches on the other coast and you can get two for the cost of one here. With that knowledge and great appreciation of my delis, bodegas, and bagel stores I dunno if I'm an eggslut myself. 

Really the \"slut\" itself (a soft egg within cheesy grits) is delicious. But would I rave over this and crave it? Would I come and wait in a huge ass line for this? But I suppose I'd rather have biscuits and gravy at 3am and not some farm to table sourced eggs cuz I'm about comfort after drinking not class.

Eggs are so damn cheap and easy to make so I'm not super impressed overall. One of the few. Stay strong eggslut cuz your Vegas peeps love you! Also doesn't hurt to eat this around the beautiful chandelier at the cosmo..."}
{"text":"It was worth the 30-40 minute line up early at 9:30am on a saturday. they really do pile on the bacon and the whole thing just simply works. best breakfast sandwich eevvveeeeer"}
{"text":"There is so much that one can do with eggs. I didn't think eggs can be made to taste so great but this place proved me wrong. It's located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel and it's definitely a stop any tourist in Vegas should make before leaving. The bad thing is that it is very popular so the line is always long. My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try and while we had to wait like 20 minutes or so in like to order, it was definitely worth the wait. My girlfriend loves egg salad so she decided to order their egg salad bagel sandwich which she says is the best egg salad she has ever had. In fact, we decided to replicate it at home and while it wasn't exactly the same, it did taste like heaven. I ordered the egg slut which was basically a mashed potato purée with an runny egg on top, served up in a glass jar with some baguettes on the side. It didn't look a lot, but it was definitely filling and quite scrumptious. I will definitely be making a return to this place if I'm ever back in Vegas."}
{"text":"My two favourite places in Vegas sound like some weird stripclubs. Milk and Eggslut. But trust that the name shouldn't deter you from trying this place! 
I like eggslut, it's a reliable breakfast, affordable enough and fast service. 
There is *always* a ridiculous lineup, but trust that it's not as long as most, these guys are slinging eggs and bacon and that doesn't take much time at all. The sandwiches are a bit more expensive ($6-7 each) than going to McDonalds or something, but you're getting a much more quality meal out of it, and you've probably drank and eaten more than enough in Vegas so far :P. Not to mention this will absolutely be cheaper than room service.
Last visit I had a sausage egg and cheese, my husband had a buttermilk biscuit and we shared a coldbrew. 
The sausage was savoury, spiced but not overwhelming, often in my experience you get a breakfast sausage patty from most places that is overwhelmingly fennel seed. On a soft, fresh brioche bun with a beautifully cooked, runny yolked egg. Pretty much heaven for me, I'm not that fancy. 
Husband enjoyed his biscuit, it was flakey, tender and came with a lot more syrup and butter than you'd want.
The cold brew was SO good but OH so small, and very expensive for what it was. Smooth and zero bitterness, but I'd skip this next time and just grab something a little more substantial for my morning java.

The only thing I'd ever want is for them to start serving some form of triangle hashbrown deal, then it'd be perfect!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was fantastic.  Got a fairfax with avocado and it was delicious.  Honestly it didn't even need the avocado.  Boyfriend got a sausage egg and cheese and said it was just alright.  Overall good experience besides the fact that beverages were crazy expensive.  $5 bucks for a 12 oz OJ!"}
{"text":"The 24 hour breakfast at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. I had the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich and my partner had the egg salad sandwich. He said his was great but I didn't really like the spicy ketchup on my BE&C (maybe it was just too much). The service was really fast and the folks there were friendly and smiling. It is worth giving it a try and why not?  Where else can you find a breakfast joint called \"Egg Slut\"!

Update:  Not open 24 hours. Please check the hours before you go."}
{"text":"Gaucho sandwich is amazing. The meat was tender, buns were soft to the bite, and just the right amount of sauce and flavor to not go overboard. The order-line was a bit long but the wait time for the food was fast."}
{"text":"Omg SO GOOD! I went here like 3 times and all the times I tried to order one dish which was the \"slut\" they ran out of it :( however I had tried 2 of their sandwiches and it is off the chart! The yolk burst in your mouth and it's just so good. Wish they had one in texas!"}
{"text":"This is the breakfast spot all the cool kids are talking about so I had to check it out.

It's definitely popular. I stopped by just after 11:00 am on a Saturday morning and a line snaked around the corner and down a connecting a hallway. After about 45 minutes I found myself at the cash register placing my order.

I went with a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a Coke, which ended up being about $11. The sandwich was good, but I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off and I don't think it lived up to the hype. 

Just FYI, seating is quite limited. During peak times, which is when I visited, you might not be able to find a table or a place to sit. I ended up walking down the hall a bit until I found a lobby with a table and chairs so I could sit and eat my meal.

In closing, I did enjoy my breakfast, but I don't think I'll stand in line for 45 minutes to not be able to find a place to sit again.

Enjoy at your own risk."}
{"text":"Initial thought with this spot was that it was going to be all hype and wouldn't be very good. I was surprisingly mistaken! The concept behind it was fun. A place where you can go get a breakfast sandwich that doesn't come out of a drive through window. 

The line was wrapped around the counter but moved pretty quickly. The nice thing is while you wait in line there is a menu on the wall so you can decide what you want before you reach the register. 

It was a tough decision because everything sounded delicious but I settled on the Fairfax sandwich and added turkey sausage and avocado to it. This particular sandwich comes with scrambled eggs, cheddar, chives and a sirracha mayo. The eggs were perfectly cooked and not at all runny ( because eww ). The turkey sausage was tender and had really good flavor and the sirracha mayo wasn't very spicy but had just enough heat that you knew it was there. 

If you're ever near an eggslut I would highly recommend giving it a chance!"}
{"text":"Despite, not being really into eggs (I hate runny yolks), I've still always wanted to try Eggslut when I'd go down to SoCal but never got an opportunity. So, I was happy to find a location in Las Vegas.

Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan across from Marquee. Went here on a Tuesday morning at around 9am and waited in line for maybe 15-20 minutes or so. I was actually surprised to see the line so long for a weekday. 

Ordered the Fairfax with turkey sausage. It was really good. I love scrambled eggs and eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice and fluffy and not dry at all. I devoured it pretty fast and would definitely get it again.

Only complaint is the wait for our food took awhile and that there is no water available, to either self-serve or a cup of water. There was only bottled water available for purchase. I opted for OJ instead and that was $5 for a small cup. But it was freshly squeezed and it tasted good. So I guess. haha Otherwise I would've just lugged with me my hydroflask next time. 

I would definitely return. Its a nice filling breakfast that's quick and easy (aka slutty). haha"}
{"text":"A couple of friends suggested I stop here at some point during our Vegas weekend. Since egg is in the name we decided to come here for breakfast on Saturday.
Initially walking up to the restaurant the line is deceiving. It appears to be a small wait until you see the line turn the corner. We waited about 35 minutes to order at the counter and then another 10 minutes to receive our order. Then you just hope to get lucky finding a seat somewhere. 
The eggslut is a good interesting flavor, not too flavorful but still very comforting. Like the tips suggest I would ask for an extra piece of bread. 
The Fairfax sandwich is very filling with perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, melted cheese, and bacon (extra charge). 
The cheeseburger was in the top ten cheeseburgers I've ever had. Despite being known for the \"eggslut\" they do have a knack for cooking meat pretty well.
I do recommend Eggslut but I just wish it had a shorter line or faster service but you can't rush the quality."}
{"text":"I really wanted to fall in love with this place, I really did. With a cheeky name and menu that revolves around one of my favorite foods, how could I not?!

When my boyfriend and I were walking around the Cosmo and saw a sign for Eggslut, I got really excited. I've seen pictures of their iconic logo all over social media, and had no idea they even had a location in Vegas! We were looking at the sign, trying to figure out where exactly it was located when an average looking man was telling us where to go. However once we took a closer look, we realized he had an ear piece of some sorts - so he was an undercover cop LOL. A nice undercover at least!!

After waiting in line for quite some time, I finally decided to order the Fairfax Sandwich. When I finally got my hands on it, I immediately dug in. It felt really indulgent, but kind of in a negative way. The cheese and what I'm guessing is oil that the eggs are cooked in gave the sandwich a really buttery and silky feel. This paired up with the already really buttery-in-nature brioche bun made it seem as if there was too similar of a flavor profile. I wish it came on a ciabatta bun of something to give it some different kind of texture. 

Although the Fairfax wasn't as successful in my opinion, that doesn't mean I wouldn't want to come back and try something else such as their Slut speciality. Til next time Eggslut!!"}
{"text":"This place was a lot faster then I thought it was going to be the bacon egg and cheese was great!"}
{"text":"Yep, the hype is worth it. There was a line, but the employees were very efficient and moved it along quickly. I was iffy on having ketchup on a breakfast sandwich, but it definitely complemented the sandwich well and was very happy I ordered the bacon and egg sandwich without modifications. There was also a generous amount of bacon which made my morning. Definitely a must if staying at the Cosmo. Also, the newly added seating area outside the restaurant/Chandelier Bar came in handy."}
{"text":"Overpriced food with mediocre quality. The \"slut\" is cooked well but very very small portion. Its service is slappy at most. Almost every staff has negative attitude. A disappointment. Not returning."}
{"text":"Yassss this is surprisingly good. Love the fluffy bread and the flavored egg. Not bad for a brunch sandwich"}
{"text":"It's okay not worth the wait or cost for a mediocre sandwich. Took about 15 min to order and another 10 to get it... got the cheeseburger which was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Who knew potato purée and poached eggs were a match made in heaven? Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan hotel is a Las Vegas institution. You'll know you're in the right spot once you see the queue of eager and often hungover folks wrapping around the corner of the 2nd floor. Everything we tried here was outrageously delicious and well worth the wait! The only thing which I would dock a star for is the pricepoint. Starting with the beef sandwich or Gaucho, the Fairfax and finally, the Slut. I honestly do cringe a little every time I actually say the name of the diner but I suppose this is all part of the image. Fun fact: the term eggslut was apparently used initially to describe chefs who cooked eggs all the time (I wanted to understand better how they came up with the name). I'm pretty sure we visited this place 3 times in the 4/5 days we were in Vegas. Another thing I loved about this place was that you can watch your food being cooked up right in front of you. The size of the place is small with limited seating is but reminiscent of its original food truck beginnings. Thanks for satisfying our egg-related urges!"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about Eggslut that I knew I had to try it out on this visit to Las Vegas! 
A coworker and I showed up around 9:30am on Tuesday and there was a line (always a 
good sign).  The staff was super friendly, the service was efficient and the breakfast sandwiches were some of the best.  We enjoyed the Fairfax with avocado and the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on brioche...so tasty!"}
{"text":"So darn good. The cheeseburger was amazing. Perfect over easy egg. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Often the line is long, which when I want something fast can be frustrating. Also, sometimes they run out of some menu items, which can be a disappointment. The food is good, just as consistent as other locations I have been. Seating can be hit or miss. I would go back, but not a necessity for every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"We were staying next door at Aria and found Eggslut on Yelp. Was definitely worth the trek! Everyone's sandwich was delicious. I had the Fairfax with avocado and bacon and it was SO GOOD. Didn't wait in line too long and managed to scope out some seating for five. If anything could have been an issue, it would have been seating, but we lucked out. Next time I'll definitely try The Slut!"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but I think it was worth it. I got the Fairfax with avocado and that cost me $10 but it tastes pretty amazing!! I'm glad I checked it out and will be visiting the LA location when I return to California!!"}
{"text":"I hate the name of this place but the food is pretty tasty. The wait is pretty quick so don't be scared of the long lines. The fairfax sandwich with added bacon was good and had nice flavors and creamy and crunchy textures. The egg dippers (I refuse to call it the S word) were delicious and I cleaned out that whole jar of puréed potato and soft poached egg. We also tried the biscuit which was flaky and buttery but not too salty just the way I like it! Would come back again for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"THe Guacho and the Slut are our #1 favorites at Eggslut for sure.

There usually a wait here so be prepared to stand in line... like others have said, the line does have a tendancy to wrap all the way around the corner. I personally wake up pretty early so I usually beat the giant line which is the only reason we still continue to come! I would never wait over 20 minutes to get food here, some people wait an hour+ for an egg sandwich and that is just crazy to me.. it's good, but it's not THAT good. 

Here's what to get:

- GAUCHO (seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun)

- FAIRFAX (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun)

- SLUT (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette)

- BUTTERMILK BISCUIT (house-made buttermilk biscuit served with butter & maple syrup)"}
{"text":"Tourist Trap! I have been to Vegas numerous times and thought about grabbing a bite to eat at Eggslut. Today, I decided was the day. Bad choice....
The line was wrapped around the corner, but moved quickly. It took about 20 mins to get to the counter. 
My husband ordered the sandwich with turkey sausage. It was NASTY. The sausage tasted like particle board. It was thin and didn't taste  meat. 
I ordered the bacon breakfast sandwich. The bacon was crispy, but is was dripping grease. 

There are plenty of places in Vegas to eat...I would recommend anywhere but here."}
{"text":"The food was decent.. Perfect to curve a hangover.

You can't go wrong when you put runny eggs on anything. The eggs weren't very seasoned though. I had the turkey sausage sandwich and it didn't disappoint. The fresh OJ was pretty good too. 

The wait was only about 10 minutes. My only gripe is that it was $30 for two sandwiches and one OJ."}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwiches although a bit pricey. Lines are always looking, but the easier isn't horrible."}
{"text":"My first visit here was at 10 am, and the line was crazy long (an estimated 45 minute wait) so I vowed to myself to show up earlier the next time. Second time around, I got there at 7:15 am for my egg fix. I was 2nd in line and waited around 10-12 minutes total for 2 sandwiches and a side salad. 

Whatever you select, the bread is rich and fluffy (yum!). The egg was perfectly cooked - just a touch of runny, orange yolk to compliment my bacon. I actually really enjoyed the side salad - it was simple and refreshing, and helped balance out the richness of the sandwiches. 

This will definitely stay in my permanent rotation of places to eat when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I went to this place for breakfast and had the turkey sausage egg and cheese sandwich, and a fresh squeezed orange juice. They were both very good. I normally would not like a runny yolk egg on my sandwich but this worked! I also ordered the sandwich with bacon to see how the bacon was. It was crispy so that was great. I hate soggy bacon. The two things are you wait a long time in line to order like at a Starbucks. Then they do not have a lot of places to sit. I did get one by the time I got my food but I went through anxiety wondering if I'd get a seat. All in all I would recommend going here. Nice fresh food."}
{"text":"Such Yummy place! Must try the Fairfax as that thing was awesome! I purchased it with Avocado and it was AMAZING! The biscuits were also good and just a little on the saltier side so make sure to add honey or sweet butter."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food here is EXCELLENT! My girlfriend and I came here and we both got their most popular sandwich which is the Fairfax(eggs,chives, onions,cheddar cheese and Siracha Mayo) I added sausage to mine and my girlfriend added Avocado to hers. Both sandwiches were really good BUT our total for both sandwiches and two 8 ounce OJ came out to $34 and some change. That's really pricey for what you're getting. Overrated! Do your self a favor and go to \"The egg and I\" where you can sit down, have a great meal, take your time and your bill will be $10 less than here."}
{"text":"When I got here, the line wrapped back to the bathrooms. However it only took me about 30 minutes to wait in line and get my food.

In my opinion, this place is pretty overrated. The fresh squeezed OJ, wasn't that great and I don't know when they squeezed it but it didn't taste fresh. I also got the biscuit which was average at best. It was still cold when I got it, pretty dry, and not that great with syrup. The sausage sandwich was okay. The egg was phenomenal and the brioche bun was amazing but the sausage fell short for me.

The service is good and quick and the place is very clean. 

This has a really casual atmosphere which was great because I was traveling alone and still had my backpack but seating is very limited. I would take it to go if you're in a big group or with kids. If you're looking for a quick breakfast, this is not it."}
{"text":"Ive been to the LA location also, and both are fantastic! Great texture and flavor of eggs and the biscuits are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Came here after a night out per the suggestion of a friend. It was 11 am on a Friday and I was wondering how this line was even this long. It was well worth the wait though. 

I ordered the gaucho sandwich and a slut. Gaucho was on point with the tender steak and the freshness of the arugula, tied together by the yolk of the egg - mmmmmmmmm! 

Now for the slut , I was curious about the name. I'm sure there is a history on it, but I'm not sure why they would name it that. Regardless, it was surprisingly pretty good! Such a simple idea, mashed potatoes and an egg coddled.  Mix it together and you get this smooth flavorful spread for toast. 

I would say a definite must visit place when in vegas. Starts your morning off right!"}
{"text":"First stop when we got to Vegas and it did not disappoint! I got the steak salad and it was amazing! The signature slut is really good too! Quick service and good food."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast food, insane line. The line was at least 30-45min the first time I tired to go. Would recommend going early or late to get some delicious breakfast food without waiting a ton of time.

I got the bacon sandwich. Was phenomenal. Lots of meat, plenty of eggs, tons of flavor. These are snacks, not full meals (or maybe I just eat too much). I'd recommend getting a sandwich here and 1-2 sides to really fill up. You won't regret getting something here, though- great for a snack before going out!"}
{"text":"Gaucho Sandwich.  So delicious I couldn't even taste the arugula.  Seared Snake River Farms Wagyu Tri-Tip Steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, arugula, brioche bun.

And I'm done son! 
Everything that I have ordered here is D-licious!   Except the arugula salad, no one likes that, take it away.   I ordered it to be more healthy, but I believe that, that is the only salad option.
Somehow this eggslut is easier to access than the one in DTLA, and I live in LA.

I love coming here when in Vegas.   I still have yet to try that egg thingy in a jar.   Until next time, SYOY!

@roxthehungryfox"}
{"text":"Egg-celent! Was so delicious and would definitely recommend it. I gave only 4 stars because I wish they had more options on their menu. I didn't want bread and opted for the salad at no additional cost. Although the salad was good, I'm not too sure about arugula with scrambled eggs and a slice of cheddar cheese."}
{"text":"A gastronome's wet dream. There is something for everyone in Vegas. I've never had a better breakfasts sandwich. The line was long but well worth the wait, I promise. This restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Lower left photo, Fairfax Sandwich: scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo, in a warm brioche bun and Gaucho Sandwich: seared wagyu tri-tip steak, over medium egg, chimichurri sauce, red onions, dresses arugula in a warm brioche bun separated by the \"bomb ass biscuit\" per the cashier suggestion."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches in the world! Eggs are done perfectly with the gooey juicy inside, delicious brioche bun.

Not a huge fan of potatoes but the namesake slut is good. Served in a small glass container, it is a creamy eggy spread over some toasted bread

The biscuit is top notch too! At $5 it might seem expensive but it's worth it - served warm with a butter spread, so"}
{"text":"Eggs out - 3.5/5 
Fairfax sandwich w/ bacon - 4/5
Fresh OJ - 5/5

Long lines, but then you get your food fairly quickly. Overall positive experience."}
{"text":"Eggslut has to be the greatest breakfast QSR concept I've ever been to. I had a Fairfax with turkey sausage and it was so good I had to have another. My wife had the slut and she was also in heaven the entire time. Ordinarily, I actively avoid turkey sausage, but I took a chance here and was pleasantly surprised that their turkey sausage tastes just like a breakfast pork sausage patty."}
{"text":"Looked for a place for breakfast and it was about a 10 minute walk from our hotel.  I had the \"Slut\" and my wife had the bacon sandwich.  The Slut was incredible, and with the baguettes it came with, was actually a nice little breakfast.  The bacon sandwich was also great.  The wait was about 10 minutes at about 8 am and the line moved pretty fast.  Everyone there seemed to really enjoy their breakfast...we'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"In my opinion the signature slut is same like Asian rice porridge. They made it unique by adding slices of butter bread. 

The bacon sandwich was decent but the cheese or ketchup made it a little sour.  I would get it again though."}
{"text":"Not the egg-sperience I was hoping for. (See what I did there?)

This place has a cult like following but really, in my opinion, it's decidedly average. I can understand the appeal when you're drunk and a sloppy sandwich is just what the doctor ordered. 

I got a bacon egg and cheese sandwich ($8) and because we're food tourists we shared their namesake \"the slut\" ($10) and the salted chocolate chip cookie. ($4.50)

The brioche was stiff and cold and the ketchup on the egg sandwich gave it that oddly distinctive McDonald's flavor. 

\"the slut\" was a disappointment too as it was really just a lot of potatoes. The coddled egg itself was good as was the toast but it didn't save the meal. Great in theory but bad in execution. 

Honestly, the real highlight was the cookie. If you're still reading and you've decided that you're still going to eat at Eggslut, get the cookie. It's crunchy and delicious."}
{"text":"Very unique in the way they serve their signature dish \"the slut\". Quite tasty but lacking in substance for only 1 egg. I'll be hungry in an hour. I will go back though"}
{"text":"This place does eggs right - hence the name! I got the Fairfax Sandwich for breakfast here and it was a nice grab and go breakfast. The sandwich itself was a bit spicier then expected with the sriracha which was fine with me, the spicier the better. What I didn't love about it was that the eggs seemed quite greasy which was unexpected. The brioche roll really added to the sandwich as a whole and while you can opt to go sans roll the roll really is a perfect addition. Speaking of additions. You can add on bacon, turkey bacon or avocado to many of the sandwiches, for a cost of course. 
I also though that they were really thoughtful and made the atmosphere cohesive with the food served. Whisk light fixture, chicken footprints on the floor, cracked egg chairs and tile resembling chicken wire on the walls all awesome totally appropriate touches for their cuisine. A lot of people seemed to be deterred by the line, but in my experience the line moved quickly. There were roughly 10-15 people ahead of me in line when I arrived around 9am and I made it through the line, ordered and was eating my sandwich within 18 minutes. 
Four stars because of the price and getting people with the steep price of add ons as well as the slightly greasy nature of the eggs."}
{"text":"This is one of the best simple breakfast place I have ever been too. You will see that the line is huge, but it goes by really quickly! It's a must try place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really delicious sandwiches. If they could only
Get the line under control but I realize they are running a non-fast food \"chain\" and everything is made to order. I think my egg was a little cold but that's also because I had to take a picture with it."}
{"text":"Located inside Cosmo, next to Marquee. The line was very long, wrapping down the hallway to the bathroom. It took us about 40 minutes to order and another 15-20 to get our food. There isn't a huge seating area either but sandwiches can be easily eaten on the go. 

GAUCHO sandwich ($14) - my absolute favorite! The waygu tri-tip was so flavorful and seared to perfection with chimichurri sauce. The arugula, red onions, cage-free over medium egg and warm brioche bun complemented the entire sandwich. It's a tad bit small for the price, but I would definitely order it again! 

SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE sandwich ($8) - pass. Just an average sandwich. 

SLUT ($10) - pass. Served in a cute little glass bottle was potato puree with an egg on top and a few slices of baguette on the side. This was definitely NOT worth it and was my least favorite item. I felt like I could just make mashed potatoes and add an egg on top. I was told to mix the potato puree and egg together well before consuming. It did not taste unique, but was rather plain. 

I am however, a huge fan of the GAUCHO sandwich and will only order that next time I come back (if the line isn't so darn long)."}
{"text":"The slut is basically the most amazing thing on the face is the planet. Best thing to do after leaving marquee is definitely getting drinks and eating the best drunk food ever. I think I will eat it again today. And maybe tomorrow. And definitely next time I'm in Vegas. I might stay in the cosmopolitan next time, just to eat here more. Yessssaaaa"}
{"text":"Absolute perfect place to begin the morning after an evening of gambling and debauchery... Egg sandwich perfection within walking distance from more gambling and alcohol--the perfect fuel for the day. LOL.  *There almost always seems to be a line, but it moves fairly quickly and it is well worth it. That brioche bun, those chives, those damn eggs.... OMG. 

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Horrible! I can't have hard broil egg with my salad when you have eggs here !?? And just because I'm not a hotel guest I don't get first come first serve !? F you eggs slut! You damn slut!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast sandwiches of my life!

We ordered the fairfax and the egg bacon and cheese. everything was cooked perfectly and decadent. You could tell each ingredient in the sandwiches were of good quality and cooked well. The bacon was crispy but slightly chewy and thick, easy to bite. Egg was perfectly cooked, the cheese was amazing and it was all wrapped in a great brioche bun. The fairfax scrambled eggs were so fluffy and delicious, melding together in the buttery smooth brioche bun.

The slut was served in a cute jar. Stir it fast and spread it on your bread. So delicious, its like right between a custard and a cooked egg texture. You really taste the egg in its best form. The sea salt just adds that extra oomph factor. I ended up finishing the bread first and scooping up the \"slut\" and finishing it.

The line is long and moves fast. The service was decent though I hated that they couldn't give me tap water, such a Vegas move. I wish they offered more seats, my feet were killing me from the walk over and I was bummed about having to stand and eat at their counter. Otherwise it was a great experience, so much so my boyfriend went back in line to order another:"}
{"text":"I think this place is mainly all hype due to its name and it being all trendy. My fiance and I were referred to this place and didn't realize how long the lines were. Expecting it to be decent considering the \"rave\", all we got was just an average egg sandwich. 

My fiance got the Fairfax and I got the Slut since those two were suppose to be their popular offerings.  Both were just OK at best and really overpriced. I'm not sure waiting in line for 30 mins would be worth it especially the cost. The drawback isn't mainly due to cost, but the cost for what you're getting. I can't value an egg sandwich that is just average to cost this much -- just as you probably won't spend $20 on a McMuffin if it were to cost that much. 

If you haven't have to wait in a long line and it was cheaper, then I can recommend it if you're craving an egg breakfast sandwich, otherwise I wouldn't recommend.  

If you absolutely have to try it, then by all means do so. Just understand that it's just a hip and trendy establishment."}
{"text":"Located in the Cosmopolitan, it was easy to find with a 20 min line as expected. This was my second visit - I remembered loving my sandwich on my first visit months earlier so this time I brought friends. 

Sadly, the sandwich was mediocre, no delicious flavor like i had remembered and my friend's Egg Slut entree with an egg over puréed potatoes in a jar was bland (and a small portion for the price!) 

I asked for salt and pepper but to my surprise, they didn't have pepper. Surprising for a breakfast joint. 

I'll be exploring other breakfast venues next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm an Eggslut.
Loved it. Spent several days at the Cosmo and tried three different sandwiches each day.
Long lines but efficient service. Friendly ordering lady. Like a food truck parked and adhered to the space. Hip, quick and tasty. Thank you Eggslut."}
{"text":"The egg slut, just okay, not a big deal IMO. 

The egg is one of my favorite foods so it's pretty possible that I may be more critical about the definition of a perfectly poached egg than most. BUT the egg slut didn't really wow me.

Positives:
The idea is somewhat novel and exciting to receive a meal in a little jar and it IS fun to spread potato and egg gooeyness on toast! 

The flavor of the potato and egg spread across the top of a crostini was satisfying and not too heavy. I enjoyed the savory and light potato and the mustard aioli. 

Negatives:
The egg was slightly over done (I thought to myself, this egg slut is NOT slutty ENOUGH!) and this item is overpriced for what it is. I love a beautifully runny and creamy yolk and when you've got something simple like this you have to nail it, which they didn't. 

The yolk was just slightly over that threshold of creamy perfection. It was close but no cigar! Maybe if you are not into a runny egg this texture would be considered perfect for you? 

Still a fun first time novelty to experience drunkenly out of the club. Maybe next time I will opt for one of the many egg sandwiches before I say that I won't be back, keep an open mind!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas after which we were going to visit LA. We had heard about eggslut in LA and were planning to go there. I had also heard about how long the line can get, so when I saw that they had a branch in vegas too , we decided to come here instead. Though there was still a line, I am sure it was not as bad as LA's. We got \"the slut\" and fairfax sandwich. 
The slut was good something unique but I was not expecting much from the sandwich. I mean come on it looked just like a normal sandwich with egg but boy I was so wrong. It was one of the creamiest, cheesiest sandwich ever. The sweetness from the caramelized onions and the Brioche bread was amazing. It didn't have any textures and though I like textures in food but I liked this soft,gooey and mushy sandwich. 
I even tried making the sandwich at home and pleased that the result was very successful. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Worth the hype and the wait! The line moves fast. The Slut and Fairfax (add bacon) are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This place is good. I just wish the portions were bigger. It's definitely for when you want something light."}
{"text":"Right in the cosmopolitan, this eggslut is open morning to night.  Don't get me wrong, this place is busy morning to night. 

The menu is simple, basically an assortment of egg sandwiches with a brioche bun and some other options. 

The egg sandwiches are always great, this time I opted for the egg salad sandwich, which was very filling. The brioche bun and sauce they add is what makes these egg sandwiches bomb. 

Another must try dish is the slut. It is a mushed up potato and poached egg sauce in a bottle. You use toast to dip it in this awesome sauce! 

The lines are super long so either come early or come at an off time!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one morning on our recent trip to Vegas.  Wife and I got the \"slut\", the bacon egg and cheese and the sausage egg and cheese.  The SEC was the best of the two sandwiches, although a bit sloppy.  The \"slut\" came in a small mason jar with mashed potatoes on the bottom and a coddled egg on top.  Loading that onto baguette slices was DELICIOUS.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's fine. If you didn't have to wait 20 to 30 minutes it would be better. If I was staying at the Cosmo and there was no line and I was hungry it would be excellent. We had a sandwich and the little glass jar with the mashed potato and egg. The sandwich was better. The novelty of mashed potato and an egg wore off after you realized how much you just paid for 5 cents worth of food. If you're not looking for a buffet or sit down breakfast it's an excellent choice, just not jaw dropping like it's been made out to be."}
{"text":"When we got to Eggslut, the line was around the corner and into the hallway.  There was a menu in the hallway which was allowed us to decided ahead of time.  We were excited and ready to order the Cheeseburger and the Slut.  My husband was contemplating on adding bacon to the cheeseburger, but it was another whopping $4, so we decided to skip the bacon.  When we finally turned the corner into the restaurant, the other menu showed the extra bacon was $3.  

When we finally ordered, we were disappointed that they were out of the Slut.  At noon.  Already?  Are you serious?  They should have let us know while we were in the long line, because we could have been there just for that item.  My husband asked when they will have it again, and they told us in an hour.  We ended up ordering the Cheeseburger and the Fairfax.  The wait for our food was pretty long.  

Finally the food came.  The cheeseburger was good.  The bun was soft and buttery.  The pickles were more on the sweet side and delicious.  My husband's Fairfax was eggy, soft, and fluffy.  Despite our disappointment that they ran out of the Slut at lunchtime, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Been here twice in 2 separate trips to Vegas and I say it is good, not great.  The Slut is unique and a must try.  I had their egg sausage sandwich twice and thought it was okay..messy but good.  Maybe they need spinach or arugula or something to give it another texture or taste to it.  

There is always a line but goes fast.  Very limited seating.  They make it fresh which is a plus."}
{"text":"The \"slut\" was worth the 25 minute wait. The kids loved the biscuits and honey butter."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty , and the menu is somewhat limited. I would go back for breakfast but $5 for a can of soda is ridiculous."}
{"text":"#1 Thing you need to know, THE LINE IS WORTH IT! Some lines in Vegas are NOT worth it, this line is worth it. Rookie mistake though, don't get in line without a coffee from somewhere else to hold you over. 

#2 I live in NYC - where I like to think the bodega breakfast sandwich reigns supreme, but this spot blew us away! Absolutely divine bread, and the ingredients in between (we tried 3 different sandwiches) were all fresh and high quality! Praying for Eggslut NYC! PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Don't let the messiness of the pics below fool you. This was hands down the best breakfast sandwich I've ever gotten. I waited in line for about 30 minutes, in all seriousness, I would've waited hours. 

I ordered the Fairfax with avocado. It is loaded up with the creamiest soft scrambled eggs you've ever tasted. They come cloaked in melted cheddar cheese with perfectly caramelized onions giving a hint of sweetness. Surrounding these quality ingredients is a Sriracha mayo providing just enough heat to round out the whole thing. It's all served inside a warm pillowy brioche bun. I definitely recommend the addition of the avocado, it provided another layer of creaminess. I could argue that most of the textures were soft, but honestly it worked so well, I didn't miss any crunch factor.

I know Eggslut has a few locations, if you find yourself near any of them, GO. It will change your life."}
{"text":"First things first, there is always a long wait outside this place going down the corridor next to it. However, it is about the same as a regular restaurant wait. We arrived about 9am one morning, and still were very far-- but waited roughly 20 minutes to order, which wasn't so bad. 

The menu options are simple: bacon egg and cheese, homemade-sausage egg and cheese, a burger, a steak option, and regular egg and cheese. They have an egg over easy dish and biscuits, but neither looked appetizing to me. 

Our group ordered a couple bacon egg and cheeses and sausage and cheeses, and WOW. This was really the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a very long time, and possibly ever. The turkey sausage was homemade and very well done. Super flavorful. The bacon egg and cheese had a ketchup type sauce on it that had a good bite. Totally 5 star worthy. The service is pretty fast and kind too. 

The only draw back is don't arrive thirsty-- this is Vegas. A bottle of water will cost you $5, and fresh squeezed orange juice is like $5-8. Also, seating gets tight when it gets busy, so consider taking our sandwich on a still on the strip!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some local breakfast and Eggslut was on the top of many lists. We waited in the queue and were excited to try some of their creative options. All sandwiches are on a brioche bun which is one of my favorites. I got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and Gary got the sausage. Mine was decent, but nothing I couldn't make at home. Gary couldn't stand his. His egg was too soft for a medium fried and the sausage had a really weird flavor. 

I regret not trying their namesake menu item which is a coddled egg and potatoes purée poached in a jar with grey salt with baguette slices. It might have improved our experience. 

They used local farmers and despite the line they move quick. Hence the two stars."}
{"text":"2nd time trying out Eggslut, first time to review, definitely will be coming here each time I go to Vegas. If you're looking for a simple meal, yet decently priced (for Vegas standards), you can't go wrong at all. Located on the 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan, there is often a line to order food, could either be really long (late breakfast/lunch) or short (dinner, early morning).

The menu is pretty simple: all variations of egg plates, a few other sandwiches, and even a burger. Both times I got the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich....excellent! Decently sized, the bacon is crisp with every bite, egg is perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth after each bite with the cheese and ketchup....perfection!

My only big gripe, $5 each drinks?! A small cup of black coffee, small orange juice, small cold brew...all $5. Pretty steep. I would suggest to bring your own drink from the casinos or Starbucks. Other than that, this place is an A+...is it worth the wait? Depends on how far the line is. Past the bathroom doors around the corner...come back later."}
{"text":"I've been to the LA location, and now here. Breakfast sandwiches here are still the bomb. You can't go wrong with the fairfax (make sure to add bacon for extra epic). Prices here are a little more expensive, which is reasonable since it's on the strip in the Cosmopolitan. We waited around 30-45 minutes to get served our food on a Saturday morning around 9:30am. Really wish they could push down the wait so we can squeeze in more time at the tables!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Cosmo and was really excited to try Eggslut after hearing so much about it and following their Instagram page. Service was slow and unorganized. It was their grand opening so I understand there will be some wrinkles to iron out but the whole experience (from the time we got in line to the time we got our food) was one hour. It was not worth the wait. I got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and arugula salad. The sandwich was below average. Too much bread, too little egg. The arugula salad was actually good, but they did not include a fork. I had to eat with my hands. Very expensive also. $65 for our party of four. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"EGGSLUT IS THE BOMB. No joke dude. 

The line was super long but moved fast, it only took about 15 minutes to get to the front. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich which is scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo, chives, and caramelized onion on a brioche bun. HOLY MOLY this has to be the best thing I've ever eaten. I devoured this thing so fast, I realized after that I didn't even get a picture  

I've been craving it ever since. PLEASE COME TO SAN DIEGO"}
{"text":"My husband had the egg, bacon  and cheese sandwich & I had the slut!! Yummm! Everything I hoped it would be & more! We were both hungover from a long night of partying Vegas style & this meal really hit the spot! There was a long line, but so worth the wait. If you like eggs & breakfast  try this spot you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"The Four Stars = to  how expensive this place is.  I only saw two dollar signs for this place, but it should be four dollar signs.

I don't remember what I ordered but it all came to $75.00
( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches 
( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches
( 2 ) breakfast desserts
( 2 ) juices or water
I'm pretty sure this was all I ordered.

It tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.  I remember that I didn't have to wait very long after placing my order.  I remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute.  I vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after."}
{"text":"First off, don't be intimidated by the line: we went two mornings in a row and there was a big line, but we waited only about 25 minutes before taking a bite of their Eggslutty goodness.

My favourite by far is the Gaucho sandwich. I absolutely loved the slice of real, juicy steak bathed in heavenly chimchurri sauce, embraced by a golden brioche bun. The downside is that it costs twice as much as their basic sandwiches.

Number 2-4 would be Bacon, then Sausage, then Fairfax, in my opinion. To be honest, these guys tasted good, but kind of boring.

I almost wish Eggslut could open full service restaurants, and that their sandwiches would come with a side of home style fries...

Definitely worth a try at least!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! I would recommended to anyone that is coming to the las vegas strip. There is only two minor downfalls to this place. One would be the waiting time. I was waiting in line for about 25 minutes. Its not ridiculously bad but when your in vacation mode an all the time helps. Secondly, i think they should squeeze in a couple extra chairs as there is limited seating. But besides those two things this place is awesome!!! Definitely a must for a vegas newbie!"}
{"text":"This is a must when you are in Vegas! The slut is so delicious with potato purée mixed with a coddled egg and spread over toast spears.  But, that's the just the breakfast appetizer... you must also order the Fairfax sandwich. It's got just enough kick with the sriracha mayo and the scrambled eggs are so fluffy and mix so well with the cheese. YUMMY! 

And don't get discouraged by the long line, it moves quickly and is sooo worth the wait."}
{"text":"9/13/17 10:07 am. Wait 14 minutes. Wednesday. The slut was good but not phenomenal. There was problem with the cash register they had to Reboot it. No problem! I stood facing the manage and the cash register for 8 minutes, he never once raised his eyes to say: sorry, hello or good morning. I was invisible. Staff cashier was very nice but customer service ought to trickle down not up. Customer Service was promoted as a key value to their concept?
9/14/17 10:27 am. Wait 24 minutes Thursday A very friendly reception, I had the a Fairfax with bacon to go, bought a drink at Walgreens for $1.67. It was a five star experience and phenomenal. Review adjusted."}
{"text":"Low stars are for low value.
 
Basic egg sandwiches.  They come in a brioche bun but other than that not much to say.  5 dollars for a biscuit, 5 dollars for small oj, no tap water only 5 dollar water bottles.  The food is good, but 30 bucks for two people and all we are were egg freaking sandwiches.  I used to eat a lot of egg sandwiches in college, so I know they are usually right there with the grilled cheese at about 3-6 bucks. 10 bucks is just overpriced for basic.

I would only go again if forced.  If you love eggs go otherwise pick one of the million other options."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night around dinner time and there was barely a line. I was able to sit my group of 8ish at their bar seating. I ordered the Gaucho, which had wagyu beef in it!!!

The combination of the steak, egg, and arugula was truly drool-worthy. I literally inhaled the thing. A great way to soak up all that alcohol that I had been guzzling all day. Yum."}
{"text":"Fast customer service despite having a long line. Service was excellent. Food was on point. No complaints. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a quick bite and loves eggs. Mahalo nui loa for the service and the food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor in the Cosmopolitan next to Momofuku.
For the past year or so since they have opened, I've been coming here at least once every Vegas trip (about 4-5 times a year).
My friends have been raving about the ones in LA, but unfortunately I don't go to LA as often as I go to Vegas.
Eggslut has a line pretty early in the morning. Like most people, I consider anything before 9am in Vegas as early. 
So the amount of egg, or in this instance I'm just gonna call it \"slut\", the amount slut you get isn't that much for the price you pay, but it tastes so damn good. 
I probably couldn't eat 2 whole sluts for breakfast, but I'm not completely satisfied with one.
Not sure if the prices are cheaper in LA, but the reason I only give the 4 star is mostly for the pricing.
Apparently sluts are also recycled here! Not even sure what that really means....
I do plan to try and make it out here at least once every trip to Vegas!

P.S. I apologize for calling their sandwiches, \"sluts\"."}
{"text":"On the strip, there are very few choices for an inexpensive, light breakfast, so we tried the Eggslut. The day before we ate here, we walked by, because the line was extremely long and there is very limited seating. The morning we did eat there, my wife and I had an egg salad sandwich for $15.00, an Arugula side salad, and two bottles of water for a total of $34.00. Not saying it was not worth it, you be the judge, but definitely expensive."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever tried! My friend and I shared the fairfax with the slut and their fresh OJ. It was a really delicious combination of flavors. Visiting from NY, I had actually heard about eggslut in SoCal. It came as a very pleasant surprise to see them in the Cosmo! It's probably good that I have to travel so far for them, bc I can really imagine them becoming a regular craving. It'd be to hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 2 pm and the line was wrapped around the corner.  Line moved pretty quick!. The sausage sandwich was very flavorful and I enjoyed every bite of it! Also got \"the slut\" which was delicious but a bit pricey. Overall one of the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had by far, definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"We almost turned around when we saw the line on Friday morning around 9 am. Glad we decided to wait it out! The line move fairly quickly and the sandwich was definitely worth the wait. We had the Fairfax with added sausage and avocado. Great bread, tasty sausage, chipotle mayo, and ripe avocado made for a filling breakfast. The coffee was excellent as was the fresh-squeezed OJ. We will try very hard to go back while we are here."}
{"text":"The line was nonexistent and the wait time was fast for two sandwiches with nice employees. We ordered the Fairfax and an egg and sausage sandwich. Both came on a fluffy brioche bun which perfectly complements an egg sandwich because none of the insides come spilling out. The eggs were well cooked and the sauces made It a unique experience. The only recommendation I can make is getting an extra egg on your Sammie because I felt the ratio of bun to egg leaned a little to the buns. If I lived close enough, I'd be a regular Egg Slut."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving! I'm from New York so I been eating BACON, EGG AND CHEESE most of my life and there's nothing like a corner store bacon egg and cheese. They add ketchup to there B.E.C which I didn't like. I was expecting for it to blow my mind but it didn't. The food isn't bad but honestly my 3 dollar B.E.C from Any Brooklyn corner store is better then there B.E.C. The line was super long, we waited about 30 mins just to order. If your staying on the strip and your a fan of breakfast sandwiches then you should definitely try it and see for yourself but to me it wasn't to my liking.... 

3.5 Stars for the Music #SuperLitPlaylist 
1 star for my B.E.C (the buns/bread)"}
{"text":"After waiting 35 minutes in line they said they are out of the Slut! They have 8 items on the menu and their store is called the Slut. How can you run out of it. The sandwiches were average and nothing special. Totally over priced. The guy didn't even try to accommodate for the inconvenience ! Will never come back."}
{"text":"Yes, the line is long. But it's not terrible. The wait will probably be around the corner when you arrive but should only take about fifteen minutes to get to the counter. Please have your order ready when you get to the counter - the main reason the line seems to take so long is that people (despite having been in line so long with access to the menu), still don't know what they want when they get to the counter. 

We had a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich and a gaucho. Both very, very good. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients used. Also had a coffee and an orange juice. My husband says that the coffee was great and strong, while I did not care for the orange juice- had a weird taste to me. 

A little pricey, but understandable considering the ingredients and the location. Would come again."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and had never had Eggslut until here at the Cosmo hotel. I love breakfast food and breakfast sandwiches and it hit the spot after a long night. Came here around 6am on a Sunday AM with one of my buddies. Menu is pretty simple. 

Perfect type of food for a hangover or to satisfy those late night/early morning munchies that is a pretty much a staple when in Vegas. There was a bit of a line even at that hour of the day. Ordered the Sausage egg and cheese sandwich. Service is relatively quick. That breakfast sandwich totally hits the spot. Earl of Sandwich is usually my go to for early AM munchies. Now Eggslut can be added to the list of favorites to hit up when you've been up all night!"}
{"text":"I'm a slut for Eggslut. From the old hip hop tunes to the perfectly cooked sausage egg sandwich, I'm officially always available for a good time. BAM! Enjoyed the cold brew with the sandy.The brew had chocolate undertones with a smooth finish. Plenty of seating and delightful customer service. I feel as though I was transported back to the '90s and was currently a supporting character in a Will Smith music video. Enjoy the flavors, my friend."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast whenever i'm in Vegas! Located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, it's pretty easy to spot as it's the only place that ever has a longass line...! Line moves decently fast though, and food comes out at a steady pace. Compared to the line in LA (which can take up to an hour!!!), this is wayyyy easier.

I usually go for the sausage egg and cheese sandwich, which is always on point, but sometimes their soft scrambled eggs in the fairfax sandwich really hits the spot. Both are good, and if you have the appetite, try both!!! They're packed with flavor even though they're both pretty simple breakfast sandwiches.

I think the slut (basically potato puree and an egg) isn't worth it...super expensive and nothing special."}
{"text":"Went before 8am but still a lineup. Moves pretty well. Ordered the regular sandwich with a water. $14. The sandwich is great egg a little runny melted cheese and bacon on a soft bun. Only counter seats and I managed to get a seat. It's opposite chandelier bar so a few seats over there."}
{"text":"All hype. 

It had the potential to be good but missed the mark.
Ordered 2 sandwiches (added bacon to both, avo to one) and a biscuit and cost $36. A little pricey for simple sandwiches.

The line to pay was about a 10 min wait, to get the food it was another 30+. 

I ordered the fairfax which has sriracha mayo & grilled onions. Didn't taste either. So much bread & not enough spread inside. I love grilled onions which is why I chose that over the slut but, meh, there weren't enough to make a difference. My husband is easily pleased by simple food. He didn't complain about his burger but didn't rave about it either. The bacon was good. The biscuit was good. Nothing special. 

I think if this was less expensive and less of a hassle to order (they don't take call ahead orders either!) then maybe I would come again? I think a side of mayo & some salt packets could've maybe helped but i didn't want to go ask the poor girl at the counter. She was working so hard to get orders out while 30 people intensely stared at her. 

Cute concept. Great menu. Just missed the mark."}
{"text":"This place was overrated but good. I had the steak and egg sandwich which was ok. The fairfax with the onions and cheddar was better, but the best was the bacon egg and cheese. The crispy bacon truly took the combo to the next level. Would come back only if the line wasn't too long."}
{"text":"Great concept, simple yet focused on what they do best.  Had the bacon, egg and Cheese...it was the best breakfast sandwich I have had.  Also, be sure and get the cookie as they'll warm it up and it is heaven.  If you live good OJ, you'll love theirs."}
{"text":"With a name like Eggslut, I had to visit while I was staying at the Cosmo! Long lines and trendy prices shouldn't keep you away from this breakfast joint. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and enjoyed it very much, but $4.50 for a cup of coffee..."}
{"text":"Eggslut was exactly what I needed after a long, eventful weekend in Vegas. I'd heard lots of good things about the location in LA, but I never got around to trying it. I was pleased to learn that they had a location at the Cosmopolitan while my friends and I were searching for a place to eat before our long trip back to San Diego. 

We parked in the parking garage inside of the hotel, which costed $7. If you can brave the scorching Vegas heat, I'd recommend walking to avoid having to pay! 

The line was really long and stretched all the way towards the bathrooms in the hallway. My friends and I waited about half an hour. We were all pretty beat from staying up all night for two nights in a row, so we really couldn't wait to grub. Thankfully, I thought the food was worth the wait! The food seemed simple. I thought, \"they're just breakfast sandwiches, right?\", but the sandwich I got was  really good for what it was. Plus, I love eggs in all of the many ways it can be cooked, so I knew I was at the right place. I got the Fairfax sandwich. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and light, and the soft brioche bun it came in made it a match made in heaven!! The flavors shined by way of the chives and sriracha mayo. I would get this again for sure. My boyfriend got the sausage, egg, and cheese and he let me have a bite, but I think the Fairfax was more memorable.

It's a bit pricey and the sandwich isn't really that big, but it's worth trying and I would probably come back if I were in Vegas again."}
{"text":"What's better than listening to your favorite Biggie jams while chowing down on a fairfax? Not a whole lot. This breakfast sammy is one of life's perfect hangover food. 

Those eggs made oh so creamy with a melt slice of cheddar and caramelized onions. And what sandwich would be complete with our the srircha mayo? This one. 

The line seems long but moves fairly quick. It's not the healthiest breakfast sandwich on the market but damn, it sure is tasty."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The wait was well worth it. Eggslut has delicious food that tastes fresh and has good flavor. I got the fair fax and added turkey sausage. I loved that you could make it your own and choose what best fit your taste. 

I suggest going earlier or later in the day. We went around 10AM and it was peak hour. Still worth every minute that we waited. 

There isn't a lot of seating right outside of Eggslut but there are lots of spots to sit if you walk around a bit. The two tip sandwich was also killer! My partner let me have a bite and boy was I happy!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Only complaint was that I waited the last day to go here and didn't buy more than one Slut!

I had the Fairfax which was amazing. I almost got out of the line to go elsewhere but someone said it moves faster than it looks which was correct. Most people want to go to Vegas for shows and gambling, not me! Eggslut is why I want to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food - I had the slut and it was tasty but very small. And unfortunately, the drinks were so expensive. $5 for a mediocre small coffee and $5 for a small bottle of pepsi"}
{"text":"The line waiting to order just just an indication of how yummy this place is - had plenty of selections to make all 3 of us happy for a quick informal breakfast.  The only drawback is the price - very high but very yummy."}
{"text":"4/5, Location: Eggslut is located at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. It's not too hard to find but if you can't, just look for the place with a long line!

4/5, Service: What can I say? If it's good, it's busy. The staff here is really friendly!

5/5, Food: It's just a breakfast sandwich, right? Yep, but it certainly takes #1 for all breakfast sandwiches I've ever had so far.

If I ever stop by in Vegas again, Eggslut will definitely be on my list to visit again. Is it worth it to wait 20-30 minutes to eat something in less than 5 minutes? Yes."}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation from friends and it was good. The line was long but moved pretty fast and it only took us about 20 mins to get to the front. The food was good but a little overpriced for what it is. I ordered the Fairfax with avacado and while it was good they forgot to put the caramelized onion. Seating area is limited as well and tables are also very tiny. Its worth trying but I probably will not go again"}
{"text":"While being in Vegas they had recommended we must try eggsult. TBH I was expecting like mind blowing. For me personally it was not that. It was something new I have eaten but not mind blowing. One thing I did like was the biscuit with honey amazing."}
{"text":"Save a slut get the Fairfax ;) I came here at midnight craving something savory and spicy and the Fairfax egg sandwich was my fix. It has soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, spicy mayo and cheese but I also add bacon, avocado, and sriracha to make it the best egg sandwich of all time. This place is consistent and has a really fun vibe. The line can be super long but it's worth the wait for the Fairfax. I don't really recommend the slut bc it's so basic. It is like $15 for the Fairfax my way-- expensive but still worth it. The slut is not really worth the price because you can master it at home."}
{"text":"A visit to Eggslut while in Vegas (or at any of their locations, really) is a must! The Fairfax sandwich + bacon + avo - grilled onions is my go-to, with a Slut on the side. Yes, it might seem overwhelming at first, but just believe me that you cannot leave without trying the Slut. Stir everything up and eat it by itself, or with the baguette, or smother it all over your Fairfax. You simply can't go wrong -- unless you don't order it at all, and that's just plain preposterous!

Some tips:
- The line can get long, but that's with any place in Vegas. Go a little early, like around 8AM, to catch breakfast and the line won't be wrapped around the corner and back up again.
- Seating is limited. Go with a party of 4 or less, unless you don't mind not being seated together. There are also Cosmo couches, but I would recommend sitting at a table to scarf everything down.
- Skip on the OJ; it's not worth $5 imo.
- You also cannot get a cup of water here, so bring your own bottle. I carried around a bottle of ice water to stay hydrated in the 100+ degree weather anyway, so that didn't bother me.
- After enjoying your Slut, remember to return the glass jar on the wall by the pick-up area!"}
{"text":"Swung by here while waiting for my room to be ready. Even at 1:30 there were about a dozen people in line ahead of me. 

Ordered the cheeseburger with the egg over hard though the menu said over medium. Runny eggs - not my thing. Anyhow, good juicy burger. Messy so grab some napkins. It's a hangover cure for sure. I suspect it's been ordered before with that in mind. 

Took about 15 minutes to get my burger. Got my warm salted chocolate chip cookie first. Maybe the over hard make it take longer. Couple of people after me received their order first. No matter! We're in Vegas so we have until the wee hours to hit the town. 

Burger was $10 plus $2 for avocado - my choice for the avo. Burger came alone. No fries, chips, etc. Yet a decent deal especially for Vegas."}
{"text":"I believe in the hype. 

Stopped by here for a weekday brunch and ordered their slut. As many other reviewers have noted, it's creamy mashed potatoes topped with a perfectly coddled egg, some seasonin's (chive and grey sea salt) in a jar along with slices of toasted and buttered baguette. 

The line was wrapped around the corner and not quite to the restrooms, but the women ahead of me did take a long time in ordering which was a bit frustrating, however, the cashier was manning two registers and my order was taken efficiently. 

I don't typically order orange juice but I did here, and it was delicious! Was it fresh-squeezed? Possibly!

I was concerned about seating, but people tend to eat and go since it's not the type of place to lounge, so by the time my order came up (within several minutes), I had secured a spot along their high top. 

At first taste, it was salty, but that's because I didn't mix it up like I was supposed to. The egg yolk had the right amount of ooze and warmth. When I did stir up the whole thing, it was good on its own or spread onto the bread, which was a perfect amount of toasted/chewiness. 

I would say if you were starving, this would not have filled you up. I was feeling a might peckish and this was the perfect amount of food. 

I debated keeping the jar, but there was nothing discerning it from any other jar, so I left it in their designated recycling shelf. Otherwise their waste is compostable! 

Very happy to have made this one of my last meals in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fairfax sandwich, just like was promoted on the hotel in room channel on the tv. Got mine with turkey sausage and avocado. It was a PERFECT egg sandwich! The eggs were creamy, so tasty! Highly recommend! Got there at 6:50 am, they open at 7, and there was already a line 10 deep. Worth the wait, I will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Very disapointed. Dry, nothing special, not worth the wait. One single egg, bacon, cheese on a roll wuth chipotle ketchup.  When you walk by, look how most people don't finish the food. Sorry guys, not for me"}
{"text":"PRO: Delicious, fast line, reasonably priced food items except for their beverages. 

CON: limited menu in comparison to their LA restaurant, limited seating. 

What you see is what you'll get. Full of deliciousness. Add other items, especially avocado."}
{"text":"So good!  Very messy sandwiches.  Lines can be long.  Price was fair, staff was friendly.  If it's busy, expect to wait several minutes, but the food is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"We discovered Eggslut last year when we came to Vegas and now it is a must stop every time we go!

I tried the \"Slut\" under their specialties menu once and I haven't been able to convince myself to try anything else! The poached egg was perfectly cooked, which sat on top of potato puree in a glass jar. Topped that with salt and chives, and there's the perfect combo! It also came with a couple slices of baguette, which were just a little on the tough side. I love the poached egg with the potato puree so I will leave it alone but maybe I will try to put the potato puree on next time!

If you like poached egg, then the Slut is a must! Will definitely go back when I am close to one of their stores again in LA and Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Over priced for what u get, but it is good. The drinks are very overpriced. Great place to sit, eat, and hang out."}
{"text":"I was very eager to try this new dining option at the Cosmo.  We waited in line at least 20 minutes around 11 am on a Wednesday.  I ordered \"The Slut\" based on Yelp reviews, and although tasty,   I would not give it or the experience more than three stars.  I am glad I went but will not return if there is a line.  Certainly pricey for what you get too."}
{"text":"I got their burger with avocado and we got an egg slut to split. So the egg was spot on - nice runny yolk and the bun was fluffy and soft and flavorful. The burger patty was extremely dry and underwhelming. The egg slut was pretty tasty. I think my first bite had all of the salt and seasoning on it. So delicious though! 5/5 for their famous dish and 1/5 for their turd burger."}
{"text":"Planned on coming here during a trip to Vegas and was not disappointed. Located in the cosmopolitan it had a classy environment surrounding it. If you like eggs then you have to eat here. The egg sandwich was delicious and fresh but the real star was the \"slut\" a glass dish holding whipped potatoes and an egg. Would come here again for a light lunch."}
{"text":"I waited an hour even though the line wasn't that long. I had the sausage egg sandwich and it wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Amazing egg sandwiches! They are open late on the weekends as well. Expect long lines but friendly service."}
{"text":"I was SO looking forward to this breakfast, considering all the reviews and a recommendation from a friend. I was disappointed in the lack of variation in the menu and the slim choice of drinks. I ordered the Fairfax, \"cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun\". I also ordered \"fresh orange juice\" after asking specifically if it was \"fresh SQUEEZED\". The girl who took my order assured me it WAS fresh squeezed, but at another location. After my first drink, I wondered if the location was the Tropicana plant. DEFINITELY NOT fresh squeezed orange juice. YUCK. The eggs on the sandwich were not cooked thoroughly, so I threw most of it away with the orange juice. I am generous in giving them three stars and did so because I like the general concept of the restaurant and the seating (which looked like broken eggs on pedestals) was super cute.  I won't visit for breakfast again, though."}
{"text":"Panini buoni e originali, comodo e ottima location. Forse un po' expensive. Personale cordiale e simpatico."}
{"text":"My opinion is out of the norm here, but I was not impressed. Eggslut's Vegas location inside the Cosmopolitan is open 24 hours. You will almost always find a long line, but my friends and I came at 5am after leaving the club so we had almost no wait. The cashier was friendly but the chef seemed overwhelmed, so I can only image how it is when there is a long line.

As for the food, I just felt that it was average. The menu is rather small and simplified. I went with the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. It consists of exactly what it says, plus chipotle katchup. The bun was large and fluffy but seemed to almost dry out quickly as I ate it. The bacon was thick and great quality but overall the sandwich was just basic. I got bored halfway through and gave the rest away, and I never waste food. I also had a bite of the Fairfax which consists of scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and Sriracha mayo. This was more interesting to me, so I suggest maybe going with something other than the basic sandwich. I think I just expected a lot more since it is so hyped up but didn't feel that it was super innovative or tasty."}
{"text":"First of all, great name for an \"easy\" egg place. I was staying at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas and this was THE breakfast spot. There was a long line, but I have to say it was worth it. I know it's hard to mess up eggs, but the sandwich I got had that perfectly cooked over medium egg that you dream of. I had that sandwich with sausage, honey mustard, and an egg on bread. I was skeptical of the honey mustard, but boy oh boy was it savory and delicious! I've been thinking about that sandwich ever since I left Vegas, so much that I want to open up an Egg Slut in Baltimore myself! One can only dream. Until next time, Egg Slut."}
{"text":"SO GoOd! The only breakfast experience I've ever had where Sir Mix-A-Lot is playing in the background. I got the Gaucho sandwich and it was amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really great food, would be 5 stars if not for the line.

The Fairfax is lovely and exactly what you imagine it to be, and the Slut is really imaginative and surprisingly filling."}
{"text":"Amazing biscuits, real buttermilk, light and fluffy. The egg salad was fantastic as well. Reasonably priced. Do you self a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"After reading reviews online, I knew I had to try this place. That, coupled with the fact that I was staying in the Cosmopolitan and I was super hungry for breakfast, meant that it was a must-try. I arrived about 30 minutes after they opened on a Monday morning to find the line around the corner and past the bathrooms. Thankfully, I was fully prepared to wait in line. What I wasn't prepared for when I got to the counter was that they were out of the turkey sandwich. You would have thought that they would post that on the menu for people to see while they wait in line and try to figure out what they want. But no, I waited in line for 30 minutes just to find out that the one sandwich I really wanted wasn't available. 30 minutes after opening!!

With my options limited, I opted for the next best thing. The regular sandwich with bacon. After placing my oreder, i waited about 10 minutes before hearing my name called. 

40 minutes later and I'm ready to chow down. Armed with a fork and some hanger, I sat down at a lounge nearby to eat my food since all the tables and chairs were taken. After eating my sandwich, I didn't feel like it was worth the wait. Was the bread satisfying? Yes. Nice and soft with a little crunch. It stood up to the rest of the sandwich well. Was the egg cooked well? It was. Was the bacon tasty? Yup, not really enough of it.  All in all, I probably would have been disappointed if I traveled to the Cosmopolitan just for this. But since it was downstairs and around the corner, I'm ok with it. Will I be back? If I wanted a quick option for breakfast while staying in the Cosmo, yes. But for anything else? Probably not."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast, and decided to have had the bacon cheeseburger. The bun itself was delicious and the rest of the burger was pretty good. However I don't know if it was worth the hype or the 20 mins that we had to wait just to order. Would definitely try a more breakfasty item next time."}
{"text":"The Eggslut did NOT disappoint!  The food is amazing, and makes up for the long line.  Seriously , make sure to eat here!"}
{"text":"Being locals we don't make it to the strip very often but when we did for a staycation I definitely had this place on my list.  We arrived to a line but I wasn't surprised after reading the reviews.  The line went fairly fast maybe 20 minutes but I have to say it was worth it.  I ordered the slut and my husband ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. 5/5 for both! And fresh oj

Flavor: right on!  Sandwich had a honey mustard type sauce that complimented the perfectly cooked runny yolk egg.  The sluts purée potato tickled my tongue to perfect delight. 

Value: slut $10.50 sandwich $8.50 fresh oj $5  great value especially on the strip and at the cosmo 

Service: A : line moved fast.  Assembly line for the food appeared organized and overall staff keeping the place clean.  I was pleased especially for how busy they were. 

I would definitely return and recommend others to not be scared off by the line.  It moves fast and it's worth it."}
{"text":"Visited with a friend and environment was lovely.  The eggs looked tasty and were well prepared."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place out. The wait was an hour, which is fine, it's opening weekend but the staff didn't move at a pace that would suggest that they cared they were slammed. We ordered the Egg Salad Sandwich and the Bacon, Egg and Cheese (no sauce). I excepted the buns to be warm, although they were nice buns overall. There's no where to sit so we ate our food at the Chandelier Bar and went home. About three hours after eating his Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich my boyfriend began puking and has been ever since. I'm so glad we waited an hour in line only for him to contract food poisoning. Thanks Eggslut!"}
{"text":"Their eggslut is amazing. Delicious soft boiled egg with mash potatoes and chives. Amazingly wonderful! Wish we could make this at home, rather than standing in line for 45 minutes. But it was worth it though...yum..."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a few times during my visits to Vegas and every time there was a long enough to be wrapped around the corner but the food was definitely worth the wait. The breakfast sandwiches here were the most fresh tasting that I've had. It amazes me how they made something so simple taste so good! 

I've had both the Applewood Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwich and the Turkey Sausage sandwich with a side of freshly squeezed orange juice. Both sandwiches were very good but I prefer the Applewood bacon over the turkey sausage. (My girlfriend tried to steal my sandwich!) I've honestly thought all breakfast sandwiches with bacon tasted the same until I tried the one that Eggslut has to offer. Eggslut will definitely be a mandatory breakfast  stop for me everytime I go to Vegas now. I look forward to trying all of the other items this place has to offer!

Something worth mentioning is that there isn't a lot of seating at the establishment so you will have to find some place to settle down and eat at the casino if you are wanting to eat your food right away versus taking it back up to your room. (I recommend that you eat it right away while it's hot)"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and have tried a few different menu items. I got the slut this time and was underwhelmed. I personally did not like the combination of potatoes and egg. My friends always rave about this place so I'm sure I'll try it again in the future. As of now, this place is just OK to me."}
{"text":"Are you an eggslut? If not you'll be one by your first visit to this semi-fast counter service restaurant. Located by the chandelier on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel you'll find this small place with a yellow neon sign and a line around the corner and down the hall. Just get in line and do it. Trust me. 

There are two menus on the wall. One right next to the register and another in the hallway the line goes down during peak times. They try to move fast so it's good to know what you want when arriving to the register. 

I've been here a number of times. Try to time your visit to when masses of people aren't entering or leaving the Marquee nightclub / dayclub. I have found 7am (5am on Sat and Sun) and 4pm provide the shortest waits. The lines do tend to move faster than you originally think. 

What do you order? I like varying the different egg styles.  
The Fairfax: The main reason most people stop here. Light fluffy scrambled eggs that are slightly undercooked with some chive. It's my favorite. 
Slut: your traditional coddled egg in a jar with potato purée. Just remember to give it a light mixing before dunking your bread. 
Gaucho: Some Wagyu Steak with an over medium egg. Some days I just have a craving for steak. 

You can also get beer or freshly squeezed orange juice. Take your pick. I like the OJ but wish the cup was bigger for $5. 

Have a great time and make some friends in line."}
{"text":"Yes.  Yes.  Yes, please.  

We stood in line for 15 minutes and got one egg slut, two breakfast sammiches, and a coffee and a juice.  2 bites into the egg slut, Boyfriend gets up, and immediately stands in line for another eggslut.  

The sammiches were yummy, but could've used a bit more salt.  I like salty breakfasts.  But that eggslut.  Oh man, I have dreams about it.  The most perfectly coddled egg, silky potatoes, yummy salt.  Heck yes.  Do yourself a favor and order your two right off the bat. 

Only complaint for the place--little seating and uncomfortable seats to boot."}
{"text":"Soooooo freakin delicious!!!! I was too scared to try out the signature slut but the fairfax sandwich add bacon and avacado was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwich!!! I took the advice from the reviewers on Yelp and Wow. I ate the Fairfax with bacon and avocado. I will be back! Freshly squeezed orange juice was the perfect compliment."}
{"text":"I was so excited that there was an Eggslut at The Cosmopolitan. I was able to introduce Eggslut to my fellow traveling companions. We actually ate here 2 days back to back. 

You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. My favorite? The egg salad. Add avocado and bacon! Skip the arugula. Hahaa

The biscuit with the honey and maple syrup is also very tasty. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The hype is real! I'll take a Fairfax and add some bacon. Please. Because the lines in the LA area are ridiculous, I was hoping that the Vegas location would give me a chance to try one of these bad boys. Luckily, I found myself in Vegas on a Monday mid-morning with a reasonable line to deal with.  

After waiting a few minutes, I was greeted with an understated sandwich with a warm brioche bun and scrambled eggs (with bacon). I look at it and think, okay this may disappoint me as a sandwich that isn't much better than a McGriddle. It may be just hype. 

Wrong. The Fairfax is something I am craving now after a few days removed from the vegas atmosphere.  The combination of ingredients and the addition of bacon makes this sandwich that literally made me stop to think about all the times I missed out on this bad boy.

I'm sure the other menu items may be pretty good, but I'm enamored with this sandwich. I hope other people lower their ratings to weed the line out. I'd encourage you to try the restaurant, but I really don't want to battle you in line. 

But really, the hype is justified, and the growth of this restaurant is indicative of other people who feel the same way as me. If you aren't happy with your sandwich, I'll take it. Serious."}
{"text":"Eggslut is one of those places that's just ridiculously overpriced, but you HAVE to come and try it at least once. That's what I did!

Order the Eggslut. You won't regret it. It's $10 but you're in Vegas so yolo. It's on the cheaper end of what you can order in the Cosmo anyway ;)"}
{"text":"Eggslut is very hyped up and people have high, high expectation's. In return there's a lot of haters on Eggslut but I'm not one of them. I came here a few times for breakfast during my stay at the Cosmo and can happily say I was pleased every time. My favorites were the Fairfax Sandwich, with turkey sausage and the Slut. My food was warm, fresh and tasteful. I agree with some people when they say they don't see what the big deal is, when it comes to the sandwiches but mine was very good. I do think the \"Slut\" is super unique and delicious, I wish I had time to get it once more before leaving. 

Caveat: I got there super early every morning, as I was still on East Coast time...so I did not wait on any type of line. Would I wait on a huge line for this? No, I definitely wouldn't....don't think its worth it. But if there's barely a line, I would absolutely say give Eggslut a try. 

Until we meet again...."}
{"text":"Amazing food but the cashier was snobby and talked down to us. As we were paying, we asked for water cups and she rolled her eyes. Tip: you can only buy bottled water...

I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and I loved it. The bread was delicious and the egg was perfect."}
{"text":"Had the Turkey sausage egg and cheese biscuit. Was good. Nice blend of flavors. The biscuit is very good, nice and flakey."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb. While the line was long, we only waited about 15 minutes. Highly recommend the egg salad! The traditional sandwiches are great as well. Being GF, I loved the option to cut the bread on any sandwich and add a salad. The salad was arugula, a lemon pepper dressing with perfectly shaved Parmesan. They also have these darling jars with egg and potato that they steam fresh for you and serve with baguette."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try eggslut for the longest time now and when I found out they had one in Vegas, I jumped on the first opportunity I got. I came here on the second day since they opened so of course there would be a long line. Totally understandable. I would say it took us about a little over an hour from first arriving at the end of the line to finally getting our food. Was the line worth it? Was it worth the wait? Was it worth the hype? No. No. No. It wasn't worth anything. I honestly felt like it wasn't anything spectacular. It was pretty much basic. For two people, I paid 43 bux for 2 damn sandwiches, 2 drinks, and a biscuit. And to find out that it all wasn't even all that great. Like seriously? You're better off going somewhere else to be honest. And I think the most annoying part is that I was still hungry! I still can't believe I paid that much over nothing. I don't know if this is just Vegas but I hear the one in LA is different but I wouldn't even risk going back again. Overall everything is just one giant nope for me."}
{"text":"They're supposed to be known for their egg and I specifically asked to make sure my egg would be runny. It was overcooked and dry. No runny yolk. Not the same as back in LA."}
{"text":"Very good food and quality ingredients but it seems like the cooks are rushing orders and the execution is very poor. Bacon in the sandwich is too soft to bite through. Would be so much better if the bacon was crispy. 
The coddled egg is one of my fav breakfast items ever, but they undercooked it and the egg whites were still raw. 
The one in LA did a much better job. Vegas location could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Egg slut is a great new addition at the Cosmo casino on strip. It only offers a few breakfast sandwich options. The eggs are cage free organic from a local farm. I visited this place a few times while I was in Vegas. 

* The Fairfax is amazing. It's scrambled eggs with chives cheddar cheese caramelized onions and siracha mayo. 
* The Eggslut was very tasty.  Lightly salted bread dipped into a jar of egg and mashed potato.  Quite innovative and tasty.
* Biscuit was a bit dry but they provided side of butter and jelly. 
* Freshly squeezed orange juice was great.

The simplicity of the menu is what makes them so good. Along with the organically. I'm a huge fan of only a few items because if you do one thing they will come out consistent every time. This place does some business. Turnover is quick. I recommend getting here early. The line can be long. But overall a decent breakfast experience. Will return for sure when I'm in town again!!!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is one of those places where all your millennial fiends tell you \"you HAVE to try it\".

YES eggslut was good. They didn't have my dairy free buns for an egg sandwich, but they accommodated with a plate of bacon and eggs.

We waited about 40 minutes to get our food... a bit much for a bacon egg and cheese.

My recommendation-- if you come here and there's a long line, skip it and go somewhere else! It's just a (pricey)!bacon egg and cheese!"}
{"text":"Excellent food a bit pricey and long lines but it's diffently worth the wait. We went to franchise in Las Vegas casino the Cosmopolitan but I hear there's one in California also or maybe even 2 but the lines are the same no matter where you go"}
{"text":"I ordered the Fairfax sandwich.  When I started eating it - I discovered that two of the main ingredients were missing- the carmelized onions and the sriracha mayo.   It's good to deliver fast ; but an incomplete sandwich is unacceptable for Eggslut.   I was too hungry to go through the hassle of waiting for a \"fix\".  The line was long and we waited 20/30 min.  With all the choices in Vegas - better to try other options."}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed after waiting for 45 minutes to eat such a dry old tasting sandwich.  I generally don't mind waiting for food, but the turkey sausage egg sandwich was such a huge disappointment. 

The sandwich itself is placed on a huge brioche bun, that wasn't sweet or pleasantly soft AT ALL.  I mean when I bit into it it tasted slightly stale to me, the turkey sausage was disgusting it was so dry and tasteless and didn't have any sausage flavor whatsoever.  The rest of the sandwich was really disappointing.  I would take a McD sandwich over this any day.  

I had a bite of my friends fair fax sandwich and perhaps that would warrant 3 stars, but I think eggslut is way overhyped and not worth the price nor the wait.  I can't believe I paid almost $9 for a nasty dry sausage egg sandwich.  It made for a great photo op but I was not satisfied whatsoever, and I am not the pickiest person at all when it comes to food. 

Save your time and money and go somewhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I loooove anything breakfast so I had to try this place out when I was in Vegas. Overall, it was a solid delicious sandwich but it was over priced, the line was long, and there were only a few seats that my friends and I had to eye and grab before anyone else took them.

I tried:
The fairfax sandwich ($8) with added bacon ($4). So $12 for scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo.

I loved it, but I wouldn't wait that long for a pricey breakfast sandwich with no guaranteed seating. I tried my friends' bacon egg and cheese sandwich and sausage egg and cheese sandwich, and they all actually liked mine best. Their sandwiches were pretty messy to eat too."}
{"text":"When in Vegas many like to gamble, shop or see some of the many shows but this Yelp Elite goes straight for the foodie hot spots! This place happened to be on my list! I made the trek from The Palazzo where I was staying to the Cosmopolitan one early morning. I figured I would skip the dark dingy gym and do a speed walk to Eggslut! I think I burned all the calories I ate too!

Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor. It's very close to the escalators so you won't miss it! It's more of a fast food type service where you stand in line (usually a long one) order and pay, then wait for your order to be called. I wasn't sure what to order so I went for the basic egg and bacon sandwich! Can't go wrong with bacon! I also got a cup of their iced cold brew! My order came up quickly maybe 10 minutes. My mouth was watering at first sight and my very first bite I was smitten! It was yummy! Some things I would have changed to make it more yummier would be to make the bread a bit crispier, the egg a bit more runny and use less ketchup. Maybe I can customize my sandwich on my next visit.

All in all I very much enjoyed my walk and breakfast sammie. I heard they have a location in Los Angeles as well and hopefully they will be making their way to San Diego!"}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place 5 stars if my food had been hot, but it was cold and my cheese didn't melt.  I feel that for the food being cold I am being generous with 4 stars.  Especially if you look at the photos on the Egg Slut website where the ooey gooey cheese is all melty goodness.

We knew it was going to be good as soon as we saw the line!  We waited about 35 minutes in line and another 15 for our food.  I noticed they prepare the food in an assembly line fashion, so one guy is cooking all the eggs and putting them in a pan, where they sit until the next guy is ready, and so on.  Had our food been hot the cheese, the sriracha mayo, and the egg would have all melded together to form the perfect bite.  That being said, it was nearly perfect even cold. 

I had the bacon and egg and cheese sandwich and my husband had the Fairfax.  We shared a biscuit which comes with butter and maple syrup.  Yummy!

Also, I know it's Vegas - but $5 for a bottled Smart water was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"THE LINE IS WORTH IT! This was my first time at Eggslut and I admit I was discouraged when I saw the super long line out the door, but I'm glad we waited! I ordered the Slut which is a boiled egg on top of a puree of potatoes in a jar along with a side of baguettes. (I added a side bacon) The boiled egg is cooked to perfection as the yolk is warm and runny. Perfect food after a night of Vegas-ing/drinking! Thank you Eggslut!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and never seems to disappoint me. Pretty pricey for the portion size but it's well worth it. I got \"The Slut\" which is 3 slices of a baguette and some sort of mashed potato sauce with an egg in it."}
{"text":"Be prepared the line is definitely long but it is SO worth it! The food is delicious. The only other negative but the food makes it worth it...there is nowhere to sit and eat. You have to stalk/fight for a seat but once you find one the experience of the wonderful Eggslut sandwich is worth it!"}
{"text":"Got the Fairfax with added sausage and it was bomb  There was a little bit of a wait but well worth it."}
{"text":"I came to eggslut in a Wednesday morning thinking there wouldn't be much of a line. After all, it was a mid week day in the winter. Wrong! There was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad because the line moves quickly.

We tried the sausage egg and cheese and the fairfax! Both were good. We wanted to try the slut, but they ran out of bread for it. Given the wait and the volume of food they have to make, I was really impressed by how quickly the food came out!

Overall, eggslut is worth trying at least once. But if you're tired and hungover and want food ASAP - go somewhere else. I think a McDonalds breakfast sandwich would have tasted just as good in the moment. Eggslut's wait is not worth it!"}
{"text":"The line was very very very long, BUT so worth the wait! We ordered three different items off the menu, each one different but so good! And the cookie!!! My mouth is watering just writing this review!"}
{"text":"The wait for Eggslut was long but worth the wait. The menu was shorter but offered a variety of breakfast like sandwiches. 

We originally wanted the slut but they were out. We ended up ordering the bacon, cheese, and egg sandwich with an order of a biscuit on the side. The sandwich was very good but on the smaller side. 

Located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel. If you are not there when they open, expect a line. Seating is limited at the Eggslut but they're open spots to sit on the second floor of the cosmopolitan. 

I will definitely be back. And I look forward to trying the gaucho sandwich. It has the chimichurri sauce that I love so much. Can't wait."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! I had the burger with bacon and egg white, while my friend had the Guacho! Both were great! I was afraid the bread would be too thick for me, but it was soft and yum! Her steak was super tender with lots of flavor (I snuck a bit). Overall... amazing!"}
{"text":"My bf and I tried Eggslut in LA and loved it. We're from San Francisco, so we don't have access to it often. When we found out one opened in Las Vegas, we knew we had to fulfill our craving!

It's in the Cosmopolitan hotel, which is right on the Strip and super convenient. We ate there on a Friday (veteran's day), arrived around 11am and waited only 30 mins - not bad at all. When you first arrive at Eggslut, the line looks short, like 4 people. However, once you turn the corner, you see this extremely long line that extends to the restrooms! It's quite intimidating, but it moves quickly. I think there were at least 50 people in front of us, and we only waited 30 mins. Really, not bad compared to LA!

Food highlights:
-The Slut - their house specialty! This is a must. It's a coddled poached egg with smooth potato purée inside a glass jar, with salt and chives. They also have slices of baguette on the side to dip or spread. 
-Sausage, Egg, & Cheese Sandwich. YUM. This is a breakfast sandwich composed of a house-made turkey sausage, over-easy egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a brioche bun. I loved the simple combo of the sausage with overeasy egg and cheese...kind of reminded me of a sophisticated McDonald's breakfast sandwich. Just simple, just wonderful. Can't go wrong with this one. The brioche bread was a little thick, but still good. 
-Fairfax Sandwich (scrambled eggs, chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo inside brioche bun). You can add avocado and a turkey sausage for additional $2 each, which was definitely a game changer. The main difference between this one and the Sausage, Egg &Cheese sandwich above is the egg - would you rather have it scrambled, or over easy? Just based on your preference. This was another great sandwich, but I didn't care so much for the sriracha mayo. That's just me though.

Service:
Food came out very quickly, maybe within 5-7 mins of ordering. It's just the line that took forever. They really should have opened a 2nd cashier, because I think the kitchen could have handled it. 

Ambiance:
You sit on these diner-style chairs, and bar seating. The seating is limited, but there's also a high turnaround of customers that just eat and go. Because of this though, all of the tables are dirty, and napkins not refilled, etc. I felt like they needed more help with cleaning. 

Overall, definitely worth trying if you've never had it before!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to eggslut! It's located on the second floor right next to the escalator. You'll know you're there when you see a line wrapped around the corner. It's worth the wait!  They also have random hours but they are always open in the middle of the night! I like to come here after work sometimes when in the mood for a good egg sandwich. I always get the Fairfax and it is honestly the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! It's scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo! I like to add avocado too.  He first time I came here I shared this sandwich with a friend and I'll never do it again!  The flavors and taste are too good to share!"}
{"text":"Finally broke down and headed over to eggslut before Cosmo starts charging for parking. (argh!)

Had their famous slut for breakfast. 

Served piping hot in a glass container it was cooked in. Interesting, but not filling at all. After all, it is mainly potatoes, with an expertly prepared egg cooked in and sitting on top. Be sure to pop the yoke and stir.

It's cute, and tasty. But not worth $10. Not even in Vegas. 

If you want something more filling, consider their more traditional breakfast sandwiches. Everything here is good and fairly priced for the most part. The slut is one of their more expensive items, but you do get to keep the glass jar!"}
{"text":"If I could give this trash ass place a 0 I would do it. All them dumbass hoes would like this overhyped shit. I would never come back to this place ever again. TRASH. THE BREAD SUCKS COCK. 1 egg per sandwich for a place called eggslut? lmfao is that a joke?"}
{"text":"Found this place reading yelp. By far one of the best breakfast restaurants to go in Vegas. The line is usually out the door no matter what time you get there but they're so fast that you'll have your food in less than 20 minutes. It's hard to find somewhere to sit because it's so busy. But I would eat it standing up if I had to.
      
    Definitely make sure you buy an egg slut and it's one of the best things I've ever had. I also got their bacon and egg sandwich which was delicious. I will go back to this place every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here for our brunch on a hungry Wednesday. I thought we would munch on as soon as we reach there cuz it's a week day and the crowd should be less. I was wrong !!! I had 10 before me in the line . I had the sausage cheese sandwich and my husband had the fair fax sandwich. And the SLUT . Do not miss the SLUT for anything . It is beautifully prepared and the potato purée blends with the egg flavor just just just perfectly. I became a huge fan to this instantly when I had my first mouth! The sandwiches were good. Esp the fairfax sandwich, the scrambled egg placed in the sandwich was very tasty and cooked perfectly ! Not an easy skill tho ;) 
But The menu is limited , which is sometimes good though, cuz you don't want to think too much when your hungry ! 
Next time I come to vegas, first thing I'm going to do is grab the SLUT from here and then think what to do next !
A perfect place for breakfast or for a grab and go !"}
{"text":"Nothing like breakfast food after a night of drinking and clubbing. My friends and I came here at 5am after clubbing because we were so hungry. Luckily, it was opened. I got the tri tip eggslut (forgot the real name). It was kinda expensive...about $16. It wasn't huge, but it was a decent size. The sandwich tasted amazing! The tri tip was flavorful and super tender. It was the most tender tri tip I ever had. The egg was cooked perfectly. I love runny yolks! The sandwich also had a chimmichurri sauce and arugula. I never been a huge fan of arugula, but it went very well. 

This place isn't huge and sometimes the wait is super long when you go during busy hours. My recommendation is go in the middle of the night LOL! To be honest, I felt like it was kinda overpriced for something you can make at home, but they do make a good sandwich and the hype really draws in the line. If you're looking for a midnight snack, this is good place to try."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge premium prices for eggs they better be good. Eggslut lived up to that criteria with perfectly soft scrambled eggs in the fairfax ($8) and delicious poached eggs in the slut ($10). Of the two, the slut was my favorite with the crusty bread pairing nicely with the soft runny egg and mashed potatoes.

Only downside is that they will not give you a free cup of tap water. So save yourself some extra $$ and head downstairs to the casino bar to grab a cup of free water first."}
{"text":"Such a great breakfast sandwich! Also the eggslut in a shot glass spread over toasted bread was amazing!"}
{"text":"Got here exactly at 8 AM and there was no line, 2 minutes later there was a large line forming behind me. Biscuits were sold out :( So we ordered the Fairfax (the favorite), the gaucho (flavorful), and the slut (whip it well and it becomes fluffy and creamy). Light, and quick breakfast! Came up to about $35 for all three. Would order the Fairfax again, and the Slut just for the cute glass jar. Service from Derrick was great as well! 
This is something I would have friends visiting in town try, but not sure if it's something I'd crave for."}
{"text":"Eggslut sure was a huge disappointment. The line was long but went by pretty quickly. 

We ordered two fairfaxes and added avocado, one coffee and one iced and one orange juice.

The egg sandwiches if anything were too salty... maybe it's the sauce or maybe just put too much salt. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce... I guess it was too saucy. 

Coffee sucks! Both of our coffees were just crappy, bland coffee. 

Orange juice is not fresh. It's Tropicana oj for sure. I know what \"fresh orange juice\" tastes like and that was not fresh. 

Eggslut is definitely overrated and not worth coming to."}
{"text":"Need a breakfast sandwich after a good night out? This is a great place to satisfy that craving. They are open until late, so that works well. Fairfax is a good bet. If there are two in the group, worth splitting that and a slut!"}
{"text":"Finally go to tried the super hyped breakfast spot. I have to see the flavors were all there, but was it worth the wait and the price? Probably not. Came here for breakfast around 9:30 and there was already a long line. We got the Gaucho and the Slut.  We liked them both but it was still pretty steep for what you're getting. I personally really enjoyed the slut (no pun intended), like mash potato with a poached egg, what's not to like."}
{"text":"The egg slut is a totally unexpected combination of mashed potatoes and egg, but it totally works. The fairfax sandwich was delicious. Will definitely be back to try their different sandwiches."}
{"text":"Truly worth the hype! The eggslut delivered on promise. The vibe is great. They even offered a warm cookie because I had to wait for the next fresh batch of sluts to be cooked. I like it fresh;-)"}
{"text":"This Eggslut restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip. This is a small restaurant with a very limited menu that specializes with cage free organic eggs. This location is very busy but the line moves very fast. 

I tried the Fairfax Sandwich. It's a locally made brioche bun that's stuffed with loose scrambled eggs, caramelized onion, chives, cheddar cheese and sriracha mayo. It's a very SQUISHY SOFT sandwich....it's super squishy with tons of squishy loose egg. I would never order it again but I know it's just me...I didn't think the brioche was the best because it was white inside.....brioche is a rich eggy buttery bread. I also thought the cheddar used wasn't the best. Really the only flavor it had was from the sriracha mayo....

My husband tried the Bacon and Cheese. His sandwich was made with lots of crisp bacon, the cheddar slice, an over medium egg and chipotle ketchup. I asked him how his sandwich was and he said squishy. I said your sandwich isn't as squishy as mine.....Mine is super squishy.

Give them a chance if you favor squishy sandwiches."}
{"text":"So good!! The eggs are super fresh and cooked very well. My fave is the fairfax with avocado and the slut. The lines can get long on the weekend but it moves pretty fast and is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fairfax with bacon is by far the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had.  Highly recommend making a stop here during your next Vegas trip.  The line will look long but actually  moves pretty quick and it is 100% worth the wait!"}
{"text":"You have to get the Goucho add Bacon!!! We got a couple of different items and this was hands down the best. The sausage, egg and cheddar sandwich was good too, but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. Our last day we decided to grab some food before heading to the airport. We decided to try Eggslut because a friend had recommended it. The line was wrapped around the corner with probably 50 people waiting to order, but we had time so we got in line. It took about 45 minutes to get to the front of the line and order our food. Once we ordered, it took about another 20-25 minutes until our food was ready. 

Food: Awesome. The bacon, egg & cheese sandwich was wonderful. It had Applewood smoked bacon, eggs, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup, and caramelized onions on a bun. I am a fairly picky eater and would normally ask them to leave off the onions and ketchup... but I was so hungry I forgot to ask them to leave it off. It didn't matter because I ate the entire thing and loved every bite! I also ordered a side biscuit and it was good... a little cold, but still good. My friend got the cheeseburger and said it was great, too.

Prices: Very reasonable. I think my total was around $18 for the sandwich, side biscuit, and a can of diet coke. Not bad at all in Vegas. 

Service: Although there wasn't much interaction with the staff since there is no sit down service here, they were still very friendly at the cash register and didn't seem stressed even though the place was packed.

Atmosphere: Just know there aren't many places to sit here. The restaurant is in a corner with not many tables and chairs for seating. The tables were full every time we happened to walk by. However, there were some sofas and extra seating areas around the corner so that was fine.

Overall, great place, awesome food. Next time I am in Vegas I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a great place. Trendy but not so great for a quick bite. Lines are always endless - it is as bottomless as the limitless mimosa. But Great food does takes time."}
{"text":"Waited in line for over 30 minutes at noon. I got the egg bacon and cheese sandwich and the cheese was not melted and the bun was cold. However, the bacon was cooked perfectly and made it worth the wait."}
{"text":"Eggslut in Las Vegas, Finally! I was excited to finally see this La based restaurant open. I went on a Friday afternoon around 1pm. Couldn't find parking for the longest in the Cosmopolitan. Walked up to where Egg slut was located and it wasn't that packed. Line wasn't long and I was able to ordered within minutes. Ordered the Gaucho but they were out. Ended up ordering the Fairfax with bacon added. The Fairfax with added bacon ended up to be $11.90. Only took a few minutes for the sandwich to come out. As I bit into the sandwich; I wasn't really amazed. It tasted just like an egg sandwich, however once all the flavors come in, it was savory with a little kick from the siracha mayo. My friend ordered the slut. It was okay as well. Basically it tasted like watery mashed potatoes with egg on top. The presentation/ idea is cute and catches your eye. The ice coffee had absolutely NO taste whatsoever. Would I come again? 50/50 maybe. I would come back to try the Guacho but other than that it's not worth fighting the strip traffic and going through a casino. But it's definitely worth trying once just to say yes, I've been there!"}
{"text":"Yum! Worth the wait in line, if you're debating if you should stand in it just do it! Have a drink in your hand and it will go by fast. Waited 24 minutes for the slut, bacon egg and cheese and sausage egg and cheese and the sausage was by far the best! Cold brew coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"First time at the egg slut. About a 10 min line on a weekday boring around 10 am. I had the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich. It was pretty good. I also had the cold brew coffee; that wasn't anything to write home about. It's pretty much only sandwiches here so don't look for a plate. I was close by so I decided to stop. I would eat here again, but I wouldn't break my neck trying to do so."}
{"text":"Quick Stop in Vegas before traveling to LA, my wife and I needed something quick and easy before heading out. So we decided to hit Eggslut because we both enjoy eggs especially on Breakfast sandwiches and on Burgers. My wife tried the sausage, egg and cheese while I tried the Burger and I Added Bacon.  I have to be honest, I don't really see what all the hype was about. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it's nothing to write home about. It's a typical burger with egg and a breakfast sandwich on a really good choice of Bread. The price point was a little high, but it's also on Vegas so that understandable."}
{"text":"\"Sluts deserve love too.\"
A not-so-quick stop for a meal you will consume quickly. We tried everything from the slut to the cheeseburger to sides and cold brew. The brioche buns are soft and plumo so if you plan to make the stop, go in with the perspective that your typical breakfast sammie is about to get bougie. Don't forget that there's a [slow] line and only three bathroom stalls!"}
{"text":"Expect a super long wait because it is a new addition in Vegas, but I would say it's pretty worth. That day I ordered the sausage egg and cheese and they told me that they ran out of sausage, which was superrrrrrrrrrr depressing. So I substituted it with bacon instead and it was still amazing. Bacon was a bit salty though. Overall the hype was somewhat worth it! Just prepare waiting in line for awhile. 

If you like eggs, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place is very good! Super flavorful, super filling, but you have to wait super long. I waited over an hour just to order the food and we ate it at the lounge that was across from the store. 

We tried a little bit of everything, but my favorite was the gaucho sandwich and the slut. The gaucho's meat was prepared and seasoned very well. The slut was interesting. It seemed like a poached egg with mashed potatoes on the bottom, but it was definitely good. 

Having 11 people in the party, we ordered around $400 of food and the food came out surprisingly fast. The staff was friendly and tried to accommodate us as best as possible. 

Definitely would recommend this place for tourists, but only if they are willing to wait."}
{"text":"It's good but it's basically you can get this at any bodega/deli in New York City. But maybe that's exactly the appeal? The line is tremendous WTF! Hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"The hype over this place is silly, the sandwich i got wasn't anything to write home about or fan over. I'm not a fan of this place, it's over overpriced even for Vegas and not really any better then Jack n box breakfast sandwich that you can get for under $5! Don't get me wrong its not horrible but i just didn't leave going wow this is amazing. The size of the sandwich left me hungry. The line was ridiculous long 15-20 min wrapping around corner probably more cause of the hype. Plus the wait varied all 3 of us ordered 1 after other and there was a 5-7 min difference in order being ready. The kitchen appears to be efficient but its not. Skip it save yourself $10 and go to Jack n Box off strip. But if you want to improve reduce the cost of the sandwich a buck or two or offer a side of hash browns and work on the efficiency of the kitchen, you have eggs, bacon, sausage ready i saw them. Work on getting the orders out faster and the line moving quicker."}
{"text":"There's usually a line for a reason - I got the sausage/egg/cheese sandwich and it was unreal. Their cold brew is also great. I wasn't crazy about the biscuit, so I'd probably skip it next time. My friend got the Slut and was very impressed with it, but I didn't try it myself."}
{"text":"Yesssssss.... get the Eggslut!!! It's not enough on its own although it's lovely and simple ! I got the sandwich and myself and a friend split the Eggslut. Perfectly placed in the Cosmopolitan...any Vegas hangover is cured by this concoction ... fixed... ready for round two or three!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that the Eggslut LA location tastes slightly better. I had the sausage, egg and cheddar and although the brioche bun was nice and soft, the cheese perfectly melted, the egg left something to be desired. Maybe it was left on the stove longer than necessary. 

The line was short at 10am, no complaints about the customer service, the only down side to this location - much like the one in la, was that there is hardly any seating. 

If in Vegas I'd make a stop here for some breakfast or late snack, it's a nice break away from buffets and burger joints."}
{"text":"Eggslut is a pretty popular new breakfast spot (there's another one in LA) that specializes in egg dishes for breakfast. We came here after our hot air balloon ride, since the meet up/drop off spot was close to the Cosmopolitan. They actually ended up dropping us off at the Cosmo, which was really nice. 

The goal was to get food, eat the food, and then go back to our hotel for a nap since we had gotten up at 4:30am that morning. The line was long but it went by very quickly. The ladies at the counter were super nice and very helpful. 

I split the Fairfax Sandwich (cage-free soft scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) and the Slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar and topped with gray salt). To be honest, both were super delicious in their own way. It's really hard to decide which one was better! 

The soft scrambled eggs in the Fairfax Sandwich were really soft and gooey - really hit the spot. But the Slut was also really good - the potato and egg mixed together very well and tasted great both on the toasted baguette and by itself."}
{"text":"Meh. Good but not worth the crazy long wait. I just had the sausage, egg and cheese. Maybe some of the other sandwiches are better but this one just average."}
{"text":"The chef is a total douche. Samantha's alright tho. She upper management. Chef def sucks tho. I think this long enough now."}
{"text":"I've got to say that I was very underwhelmed by my eggslut experience. Perhaps my expectations were too high from all the hype.  I had the fairfax which I found messy, very greasy, and unpleasantly mushy. I would have honestly preferred a Mcmuffin from Mcdonalds. On the upside, the presentation was adorable and it kept me full for a good 8 hours!

The wait wasn't too bad so thankfully I didn't feel like I wasted too much time on this disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Brace yourselves, it's gonna be a hell of a line! 

We stood in line for about an hour on a Sunday morning. I love their food and all, but really they need to do something with the line. There was only one cashier taking the orders. The food took a while to get prepared too. I really don't know if it's that worth it."}
{"text":"The food is good but it is definitely over price. I order the sausage egg bigger with Avocado and my husband order ordered cheese burger with Avocado, two orange juice and a side salad. The price is about $50.. the most expensive burger I've ever had. Again, the taste is good, environment is nice. If you have a lot of money, you can go and try out. I would only try it once."}
{"text":"Line for lunch was about 30 minutes. If you just get the sandwhich, you won't be full, but I think the slut is overrated. It's basically an egg on mashed potatoes and toasted bread. The fair fax sandwhich was pretty good as it the egg sandwhich was a bit spicy, I enjoyed that. Tried the orange juice, it was fine and and not worth it IMO."}
{"text":"Long wait, but so worth it! I ordered the Slut - it was delicious, and so fun to get breakfast in a jar! I will definitely order again. Hubby ordered the Bacon, Egg and Cheese breakfast sandwich.  You can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"The absolute best tasting breakfast I've ever had. Husband and I both got the fairfax and it was amazing! The aioli is pretty much the highlight of the sandwich. I was very hesitant about eating here because of the long wait and limited seating but the wait is definitely worth it. Hope the ones in LA can keep up to par!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time! Nothing says delicious breakfast like a perfectly made egg sandwich. The place is a bit small with limited seating area, I believe that's why the lines are unnecessarily long most of the time, but it is definitely a popular place despite the small size.

I ordered an eggsalad sandwich, for a quick pick me up before heading out for meetings. I had a hard finding an empty seat for just myself , waited for a few minutes for someone else to finish up first. 
The egg salad was creamy , almost melts in my mouth with every bite! Worth every dollar! The pretzel bread adds a bit of a special taste to the sandwich !
Definitely a must try place for the food, and even more so just to try it because why wouldn't you want to try a restaurant named \"eggslut\""}
{"text":"How convenient was it that it was right there when I left Marquee Dayclub one afternoon. The name sounded familiar and my friend told me about their fame in the West Coast. Right! Now I remember. My friend and I caught the lines at a decent time, less than 10 people in line. Win! We heard that the lines get crazy at all hours. The menu was selective and prices were decent for most items. I was not knowledgeable about the food Eggslut had to offer but my friend guided me into having one of their specialties, the Slut. I wanted a salad but arugula was not my preference. For $10, you get an egg coddled in a small jar on top of potato puree. Just think of a small lightly cooked egg over mashed potatoes with enough salt and some chives served with three thin slices of baguette. Ask for extra baguette slices. Yes, delicious. No, not worth it nor was it filling. The wait for the food was longer than me devouring it in less 5 minutes."}
{"text":"We just visited from Denver, and EggSlut was the only place we ate at more than once. The signature Slut is awesome, that's a given, but make sure you let your wife get that and you get yourself a \"Gaucho\" sandwich (and add bacon to that, it's a must!). Tender, perfectly cooked meat on a great brioche bun. And the staff was a blast, we enjoyed the laughs. And decent prices considering it's on Strip in the Cosmo

My only requests: 1) you guys should bust out an in-house made hot sauce. I mean you're serving egg sandwiches, right? Blow our minds with a little homemade zip. 2) I'd love a little more on the salad. It was a delicious dressing, tasty cheese, arugula... but that was it. Another ingredient or 2 would be fabulous. 

Thanks much! We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"This I had the bacon, egg, and cheese but instead of the chipotle ketchup, I had the Sriracha mayo instead. I enjoyed the sandwich but in my opinion a bacon, egg, and cheese from a bodega in New York is just as good or even better for half of the price. I really don't understand what all the hype is about this place but it is good for a late night eat if you are coming out of the Marquee"}
{"text":"What can I say? We fell for the hype... ? We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before hopping on the plane and while I was in favor of Earl of Sandwich in our hotel, hubby wanted to try out Eggslut as it had been on his list for a while. When we arrived, I ran to secure seats and hubby hopped in the semi-long line which was growing by the minute. I honestly thought the menu was more exhaustive judging by the thousands of pics on Yelp but it was pretty straightforward with about 15 items total (including drinks).  I went for the sausage/egg/cheese, hubby got the cheeseburger, and our friend ordered the Gaucho. Our friend and I agreed that our food was pretty average, especially for the price (pricing is on par with other popular Vegas spots) but hubby was loving his burger... he was committed and was going to hold on to hope. I will say that the medium fried egg and aioli was pretty different for your typical SEC sandwich and the bread was pretty quality. I can't say that I would rush back to this place though. By the way, the beverages are highly upcharged in my opinion - $5 for a can of soda or 12 oz of orange juice is kinda ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm not what you would call a hearty breakfast person so I appreciate a place that serves something on the smaller side. 

I've been to this location as well as the one in the Grand Central Market in LA a handful of times. This store is found on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan surrounded by other eateries and dessert shops.

Expect a very long line in the morning. On weekdays it's conference attendees trying to get food before their sessions begin and on weekends the line is full of tourists. It's a solid 30 minutes usually between the end of the line and when you get to the register. On nearly all of my visits to this place there's only been one cashier helping folks even though there are a total of two registers. I've found that surprising considering the volume of people. The food comes out quickly though and there's usually seating to be found either at one of the tables within the shop or just outside.

I've always gotten The Slut which is a cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. The bread is for dipping or you can just layer the egg and potato puree on each slice like a spread. Either way three slices of bread is not enough so we run out and have to eat the rest right out of the jar with a spoon. The Slut runs $10.50 at this location.

They also have coffees and fresh-squeezed orange juice which runs another $5. It's ridiculous pricing but it's Vegas so it's to be expected.

Nonetheless the portion is just right and the food is great so I always make it a point to visit when I can stomach the line (pun intended)."}
{"text":"It is genius to have this place open up at midnight every day. When the clubheads leave Marquee they come out and see delicious sandwiches and sluts being prepared.

The namesake \"Slut\" is a coddled egg on top of potato puree, with chives and sea salt. It's served in a glass jar because that's what foodies/hipsters love and makes their IG pic look delicious AF. Luckily, it's just as tasty as any filter would make it look. My only complaint would be that I wish I had more baguettes to eat it with. Make sure to use the spoon before eating to break the egg and mix it throughout with the potato puree.

I've also had both the sausage, egg, and cheddar sandwich along with the bacon and egg sandwich. These are both good deals for the price (~$8), and I suggest a full meal would be one slut and one sandwich (two sandwiches and a slut if two are dining).

There are long lines in the morning, as I've waitied up to 45 minutes, so ask yourself if it's worth the wait. Shorter lines at night if you're looking for some drunk food. Eggslut has definitely been added to my rotation."}
{"text":"Totally not worth the money.  $13 for an average sandwich and $10 for a mini jar of potatoes and an egg.  Small menu.  Definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time & I was pleased!! Food is made fresh. Simple menu. Breakfast sandwich is $8.50 alone. Coffee is great! Lines are long but not too long. Worth the wait. The seating is limited. But people empty their seats as soon as they are done. The music playing in the background is the bomb! Reggae,hip hop, R&B etc. Food is delicious. You can watch the cooks make the food. One thing I would critique is the sauce. It says chipotle ketchup. Sauce didn't have a kick to it. Taste like ketchup!"}
{"text":"Finally waited in the long ass line!! Lol 

i went to the Beverly Hills location before & the line was wayyyy too long, so i left.. But i knew this place had to be good. Came to Vegas & seen there was a Vegas location inside the Cosmo, so i went & the line was hella long again!! But i decided to wait this time because i just had to see what the hype was about.. 

& it was WORTH THE WAIT.
DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"It really shouldn't take this long to fry an egg when your grill is perpetually hot. By the time the food was ready, it was lukewarm. Did the bacon, egg, and cheese taste good?  Yeah, but you can make it at home in half the time easily. Not worth the money or wait."}
{"text":"So good! Very simple but it has layers of flavor that is exclusive to this brand of slutting.

Will I return to this place?
You bet your ass."}
{"text":"I live in Southern California and there is an Eggslut in LA.  However, I have not had a chance to to it yet.   Then I saw there was in Vegas, so I had to take the opportunity to try it. 

I came a little bit after 9am and there was a decent line, although as others have said it moved quickly.  I probably waited about 25 minutes.  I ordered the sausage egg cheese sandwich.  It came out soon after I ordered, which was a little surprising for me.

The sandwich itself is good.  I liked the flavor of the sausage and the egg was a little runny.  The mustard aioli was a good addition to the sandwich, since all the other elements are fairly rich tasting.  Overall, I was not blown away for the price I paid, so I am giving four stars.  It was still a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Also I was surprised to see that the lines are just as long as the one in Los Angeles. The line wrapped around the back but I waited probably 15 minutes. 
Gaucho burger for my mom (she loved it), turkey sausage egg and cheese for me, we also got a honey butter biscuit (so good), and coffee and oj to drink.
I'm really glad that this spot is here because I wanted my mom to try egg slut and since we were in Vegas it was convenient that this place was here. 
Everything's so delicious just like the original location"}
{"text":"Great experience fantastic staff the food was delicious..  anybody who loves eggs or even just like eggs ABSOLUTELY MUST!"}
{"text":"Since I was staying at the Cosmopolitan, it made sense for me to grab breakfast here on my first morning (and mama was starving since I had gotten in late the night before and immediately went out without eating). 

At 8:30 a.m. on a Saturday, the line was about 12 people deep, but it moved fairly quickly. Order at the counter and wait for your food. 

I got 3 different sammys: sausage, bacon and egg salad. The sandwiches were all solid and I like the arugula to give it some veg action.

Overall, nothing special -- stuff I can easily make at home. But it's one of the cheaper options inside Cosmo. Or, you can cross the street and go to McD's for a sausage egg mcmuffin -- that would satisfy a similar craving."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were decadent and very popular! Come early, by 9:30 am there was a 50 person line. It takes like 30 minutes to get your food. Very annoying to get to the cosmopolitan/this restaurant unless you're staying there and now the charge parking down at all the hotels and casinos, so be prepared. Maybe uber or use lyft.

Seating is limited so you might want to take it to-go or sit in the areas around the chandelier bar.

The Gaucho was tri tip beef (mid-rare) with chimichurri, an egg, arugula and red onions. For $15 I was happy. It was on a luxurious brioche roll: it was perfect.

My husband liked his burger for $10 but was not that impressed with the quality of the burger.

It's a funny name for a restaurant and when you eat your sandwich, it's quite graphic. The eggs explode while biting into your sandwich which are double-wrapped. Don't wear white. Bring hand wipes. 

The coffee is $5 and is gross. I don't know if it's burnt or what, but it's overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast place EVER!!  You wait in line for 30 minutes for an $8 cold breakfast sandwich that is greasy on a horrible  bun.  The $5 biscuit looks like it came from a Pillsbury doughboy  can.  The Egg McMuffin is 10 times better if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened across the street from my apartment in downtown Los Angelee. It was a little pretentious but the food made up for the attitude. This Vegas location is a joke. Nothing like it's LA counterpart. The eggs were dry, the bun was dense and cold like it was factory produced, the meat on the burger looked like a frozen patty and was over cooked, the egg on my burger was cooked solid, and topped all off with a watered down cold brew. Polar opposite of my experience with the LA location. We got one of every sandwich with my crew and we all felt the same. Overcooked dry eggs on the Fairfax as well. It sucked and it's all hype here. Don't waste your time, unless you don't know good food."}
{"text":"What an egg-citing spot to get egg-cellent breakfast sandwiches! Ok I'll stop with the puns. This eatery located on the second floor of the Cosmo is a perfect addition to the casino's collection of hip and trendy places to nosh. They open really late at night and close up in the afternoon. My friends and I ate here twice on our last visit to Vegas. The first was a late night stop to try the Slut, which is like a poached egg on top of puréed potato in a glass jar. You mix it up and put the resulting spread on slices of toasted baguette. It is heavenly. 

On our next visit, which was Sunday morning - the line was hella long. We probably waited in line to order for thirty minutes and then another 15 or so to get our food. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich, which is perfectly cooked scrambled egg and caramelized onions and cheddar cheese with sriracha mayo on a brioche bun. You can add a turkey sausage or avocado for an eggs-tra charge (sorry! Couldn't help it!) I added an avocado. The sandwich was so delicious!!! My friend ordered the egg salad sandwich and that was also super yummy! You can't go wrong with the choices here. They are eggs-perts at what they do (last pun, I promise!). I can't wait to come back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"We went around 1:00pm on Sunday so there was a significantly long line but we were willing to wait because we've heard great things about Eggslut. We ordered an egg cheese and bacon sandwich and a fairfax sandwich. The brioche bun used for sandwiches have a soft texture, overall a great taste!"}
{"text":"It was on our top \"MUST TRY FOOD\" list, and the sandwich did not disappoint! The wait was long of course, and I personally did not like the SLUT all that much, it just tasted like mashed potatoes with chives, wasn't a huge fan, but the fairfax was the BOMB!!!!!!! But overall I thought the place is overrated, I've had better brunch sandwiches in NYC. Worth trying but would I come back if I visit Vegas again? Prob not."}
{"text":"Such a unique and flavorful breakfast!! Totally worth the wait, would visit again for sure!!"}
{"text":"The bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is the best! Just writing this review it makes my mouth water! A must go!"}
{"text":"Super expensive, super long line, still worth it imho.
I love eggs. So any new eggsperience is worth it in my book.

Tried the famous egg slut. Loved what they tried to do with a breakfast classic of eggs and potatoes and changed up the texture - coddled egg over mashed potatoes with grey salt and chives on top. You take the toasted french bread swirl it up real good and eat it in all its gooey glory. 

My seggcond favorite was the bacon egg and cheese on the softest brioche you ever did taste. Lots of ketchup. Bests the corner deli that you usually get your BEC, so price warranted."}
{"text":"YAY!! Finally some amazing breakfast/hang over food in Vegas! My favorite sandwich is the Fairfax and I am so happy it is just as delicious as in the L.A. location. This visit I added a turkey sausage patty to it and it was SO juicy and SO flavorful- I will definitely be ordering that again! For my sweet tooth the salted chocolate chip cookie was amazing- served warm with melted chocolate chips packed inside and not too much salt sprinkled on top. I know you're wondering about the line... There is some waiting but the line does move at a decent pace considering they are making everyone's sandwich to order."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch.
I have to say I think this place is a little overhyped. The line was very long (at least 30 minutes) and the food was expensive! 
I got the Gaucho sandwich. The meat was really tasty and you could tell it was high quality. The brioche bun was nice and crunchy. The other components were not as successful. The egg was not as runny as I would have liked it to be. The biggest buzzkill for me was the amount of arugula on the sandwich (admittedly arugula isn't my favorite). The sandwich was overloaded with it and the flavor overwhelmed the rest of the components flavors.
Overall I don't think I'd come back. The line was too long and the food was not cheap. Seating was also a little cramped and we had to fight for a spot."}
{"text":"I understand your skepticism. I too was skeptical, because ultimately, there are only so many ways to put egg on bread. The bacon egg and cheese was kind of along those expected lines. Fried egg on a spectacular bioche with piles of perfectly crispy bacon and some spicy ketchup stuff: Among the best BEC I have ever had, but still just an egg sandwich. 

However, the Fairfax is the one that changed my life forever. I am a different person than I was before that sandwich and I can never go back! It's the most masterfully scrambled egg I have ever experienced and far beyond what I could imagine. It was like air. Or silk. Airy silk? Creamy airy silk. With amazon seasoning and herbs and chives and chipotle aoili or something, and all on that baller brioche. A truly mind blowing eggsperience and worth the 20 minute wait in line!

PS: that fresh orange juice is no joke, you've already waited for infinity to experience peak breakfast perfection, so spring the extra five bucks to wash it down with straight luxury."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Instagram long ago, and knew that I had to go there at some point.  My wife came out here for work, and I decided to come along, totally forgetting about this place until I was doing some research on places to eat.  I stopped down the morning we were leaving, and the line was pretty short ( typical morning line was around the corner, this was at 7:15 am).  Grabbed a couple sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches and a biscuit to go.  So good! Seating is limited, but you could probably find somewhere to sit close by, or go back to the room. Make the time to stop here, breakfast IS the most important meal of the day, after all."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Eggslut while in Vegas because I have been wanting to try the LA location for quite sometime.  Located on the second level of the Cosmopolitan, we decided to have our late lunch here because there also wasn't a line (it was 1PM). I ordered the Fairfax and my fiance ordered the Gaucho; both orders came out quickly. For such a popular place, I wasn't impressed. The Fairfax consisted of soft scrambled eggs/chives/cheddar/caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun. The overall sandwich lacked flavor and the consistency of the eggs was too runny/watery. The brioche bun was my favorite part. My fiance however, enjoyed his sandwich very much. The Gaucho had wagyu tri-tip steak over a medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and arugula on a brioche bun, I took a bite of his' and had to admit that I ordered the wrong one..the Gaucho was yummy. 
Maybe I expected more from all the hype. Hope to try other sandwiches at Eggslut during my next visit to Vegas or La la Land."}
{"text":"30 minutes wait. WORTH IT! Right next to the Chandelier bar. Small kitchen area. You can watch them on every step of cooking your food. Half of the seating area is Alice In Wonderland themed. Biscuit is $5. Close to the size of a baseball. Served toasty warm with a sweet butter. Not too sweet. Egg sandwich didn't skimp on bacon but was still a part of the sandwich. It didn't overtake it. The two with me got the Eggslut, a coddled egg over puréed potatoes served in a little jar. It is served with pieces of baguette. You could replace the bread with a beautiful side salad."}
{"text":"Perfect for breakfast/brunch. Hits the spot on the dot. Not too expensive very classy sandwiches with eggs incorporated into it. Great for hangovers the next day as well. Great for families with kids, as my kids ate up their sandwiches. Very delicious because my picky kids approved."}
{"text":"Yummy egg sandwich! I had Fairfax sandwich and I can confess that my sandwich was the most amazing egg sandwich that I ever had. Biroche bun toasted perfectly and scrambled egg was so soft and creamy! I literally chewed each bite twice as much as I normally chew so I could enjoy the extreme delicious taste and aroma of spices. 

I wish the portion of sandwich was a little bit bigger so I could have enjoyed more of it."}
{"text":"Ok I'm partial on my rating because I only had the slut and really didn't read what I was getting. I figured it's what they are known for right? OMFG! Such a surprise with the puréed potato. I know that now cause I read the description. I loved the taste. Not overwhelming and the texture with the pureed potato made it firm rather than runny.  Came everyday after while on vacation. Oh and fresher squeezed OJ was yum!"}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 stars from me, maybe even 3.5.

Marketing is key - so I think this place gets a good portion of it's hype from having 'slut' in the name. People line up to eat here, and maybe because the menu prices are low for breakfast on The Strip.

I had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich with a scrambled egg. The bacon was delicious, the soft scrambled eggs were definitely cooked soft, and the cheese was good. The chipotle ketchup they put on there is just OK - it tastes out of place on that sandwich. The bun is also a bit much - I'd prefer it on something else. However, I would eat this sandwich again.

My wife got the signature item, the Slut. It's essentially a poached egg on top of \"potato puree\" that's sou-vided in a baby food jar with a few chives sprinkled on top. I saw them running the sou-vide cookers at 142, so, there's the big secret. It's served with some toast, and I guess the way to eat it is to smear some of the egg/potato concoction on top of the toast and chow down. Runny eggs aren't my thing, but for $10.50, this seemed way overhyped and way overpriced.

We also got a biscuit, cold brew coffee and a coke, each of these items were $5. All of this was $41 after a 15% tip. The biscuit was good, but not $5 good. 

I am glad I came here as I've been recommended here, but I'd come back and just get a sandwich - the other items are well overpriced. I also wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes or so in line."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Eggslut for a while-- it definitely didn't disappoint. The bacon was cut thick and melts in your mouth. They make all sandwiches to order. Only pitfall is the wait.. I was prepared for it so I was fine (just hungry!), but be sure to go earlier than you plan to eat. 

I also got the honey butter biscuit. It was so-so... Eggslut is definitely more known for its breakfast sandwiches than biscuits. I'd give it a 3/5."}
{"text":"OMG. That slut was so good. lol

I didn't know what to order, but that was what Yelp told me to order. Out of curiosity, I also ordered the homemade buttermilk biscuit. 

The slut was so creamy and the perfect texture to spread on the toasted bread. Savory potato goodness. I loved it. So good for breakfast. The biscuit on the other hand was pretty plain. Nothing special about it. I actually prefer the one at Popeye's more so skip that. 

The line is pretty long in the mornings, but moves quick. It only takes a while to get the food. They will call out your name or number. There is limited seating so you might want to take it to go."}
{"text":"Eggslut. What an amazing name. 

I ordered the slut and it was delicious. My only gripe is they only provide 3 baguettes, they should provide atleast 4-5. 

I stayed at the cosmo, and simply took elevator down the eastwing and went early at 7:30am, and no line. Wonderful brekkie option."}
{"text":"I love the name of this place which is honestly what attracted us to it. And it was also in the Cosmopolitan hotel and we were checking out the beautiful hotel anyways and were starving. Menu is pretty to the point just be aware it's only the food there is not meal options aka it doesn't come with a side or a drink. And all the drink options were like $5 extra. OJ? $5. A bottle of water? $5. So fuck that noise just get the food. The cheeseburger and the bacon egg and cheese sandwiches were bomb and filling and at a decent price. Also service was pretty fast turn around. So check this place out if you're hungry for some breakfast type food!"}
{"text":"I'm reserving a star for the next time I visit again, but I have been waiting to try Eggslut for awhile now every since the pictures surfaced all over FB/IG when it opened in LA. Now that it's in the mecca collection that is Vegas, all the better! I personally love eggs...throw me an egg with any meal and I'll be perfectly satisfied, even if there's only rice as the other side. This was the first stop we made in Vegas when we got off the plane at 8:30, since I wanted me some breakfast!

You can't miss it; it's by the chandelier across from Marquee, but do check the hours as they are breakfast and early AM hours  mostly. I had to try the famous Slut. Yes, a little pricey at $10, but I had to do it. Reading the description didn't sound that appetizing...eggs on mashed potatoes? Well...I guess it could be like eggs and rice? It just sounded very mushy. But...give it a shot! Mix your coddled egg into the mashed potatoes with the chives and \"gray salt\" (that I couldn't really see) and let the warm yolky egg + mashed potatoes just melt your tastebuds. Comfort food at its best!

I want to come back and try a breakfast sandwich next time. Watching them grill that bacon is so tantalizing and smells heavenly! 

Word of advice; bar seating is kind of limited by their area so if you have a few people, make someone claim a seat first :) Or else you might have to spread out over the lounge chairs near the chandelier!"}
{"text":"The line for the Eggslut at the Cosmo is a lot smaller than the ridiculous line you see outside Grand Central Market in LA -- a huge plus for me because I simply hate waiting more than 45 minutes for a sandwich I can finish in 7 bites. Speaking of the differences, the sandwiches here actually tasted better - I can't pinpoint exactly what it is, but it may be the taste of the bacon and the bread from the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. A+ for food, B+ for pricing (still don't believe that the average sandwich is worth 10 dollars)."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of breakfast sandwiches until now, this place is delicious. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I got the steak sandwich. I'd recommend not getting it w/ arugula... 10x better taste wise. Presentation looked amazing and I'd definitely come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I knew coming here, there would be a long line. We waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad. There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.

We got the infamous \"slut,\" Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is! 

Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nah fam. Disappointed in the quality of food. Ordered OJ, sausage and egg and bacon and egg sandwich. Neither one was good. The wait was terribly long, probably would only be satisfying if drunk. Not sure how it was rated so well."}
{"text":"My advice is to get a breakfast sandwich here and come early to save yourself from the lines that form at opening.  Fresh eggs and delicious bread makes this a light and tasty treat."}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwich I have ever had!  This gourmet breakfast sandwich takes comfort food to another level.  All of their ingredients are made from scratch and the bread is made locally.  You can taste the freshness.  The sandwich I recommend is the GAUCHO.  The Gaucho is seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun.  The tri-tip was cooked medium and to perfectoin then you get the run of the egg yolk with the chimichurri on the back end then the nice chew of the brioche bun.  Nothing but spectacular.   The next sandwich I recommend is I went basic and did the SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE.  The sandwich consists of house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun.  This sandwich was simple and all the ingredients complemented each other nicely.  Keep it simple stupid!  The only negative was that there was not to many places to sit since this place is always busy but for good reason they make amazing from scratch food.  They are also a little pricey for just breakfast sandwiches but they are worth the try for sure.  So, if you are in Vegas next time and you walk but the SLUT go over and buy one!  Haha!

{"text":"Worth the line !!!! Drinks aren't cheap, I recommend grabbing a beer from CVS and bringing it with"}
{"text":"Loved the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich. Can't go wrong with a classic, and an $8 breakfast. It's a large sandwich too- they don't skimp on the portion. The line was wrapped around the corner around 9am and full wait time was 30 minutes. Once my order was placed, I had my food in about 2 minutes. Would wait again!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch at 11:00 today. The line was wrapped around to the side hallway where the bathrooms were! A couple behind me asked an employee walking out of the side door about how long it would take to get to the front.. He responded an hour (a few minutes later the couple left the line). To my surprise the line moved quickly and only took 30 minutes to get to the front. I got the \"slut\" and my husband got the cheeseburger. Both cooked to perfection and full of flavor. Well worth it! Don't let the line scare you away."}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't eat here again, but it was ok.  Did the job of providing breakfast, which is actually a little tough in Vegas. What was on the menu looked good, but you don't have a \"breakfast plate\" or combo-type option.  The menu is pretty limited.  We had the bacon, egg and cheese sammich and the sausage, egg and cheese sammich.  Since it doesn't come with anything, there are two sides available a la carte... a salad or a biscuit.  We got the salad, which was arugula with a very minimal amount of red wine vinaigrette and lightly shaved manchego cheese.  I didn't taste the cheese because it was sprinkled on the top and my b.f. ate it all .  It was an alright salad though.  The sammiches were good, but I needed a fork and knife to eat the sausage one because the yolk was pretty messy. Ambience is cute, but music was pretty loud for that early in the morning... I sound old .  Honestly, this place is probably a good \"late drunken night\" kinda food.  Lol"}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food. I try not to write bad reviews but this one I should let people know not to have any expectations. We had to wait for our egg sandwiches when in fact these made ones were sitting on the counter for 20 minutes. We asked if these are ours twice to the waitress and she said it's not and 20 minutes later she said it's ours, it's already got cold been sitting on for so long. The sandwich tasted so bad that I could only take a bite. So disappointing having a such a bad service especially location from codmopolitan."}
{"text":"While on my trip to Vegas for a conference, I tried eggslut for the first time. The first time I went there, it was later in the day and the line was not long. I ordered the fairfax sandwich without any add-ons. The wait for the food was not long, however, there was no open seating available. I found some couches not too far away but it made it tough to eat since it got a little messy with the eggs falling out. Nevertheless, the taste was absolutely divine! The eggs were so fluffy they melted in my mouth! It was undeniably delicious and I had to make another trip prior to my departure from Vegas. The second visit I made was in the morning for breakfast and the line was huge! But.. I waited and this time I ordered a fairfax sandwich with turkey sausage (+2 or 3$). I will be honest, I liked the sandwich a lot more without the turkey sausage because the meat killed the taste of the eggs for me. I could no longer sense the fluffy texture of scrambled eggs I did my first time. I recommend everyone to give this place a try. Some tips: don't go in the morning unless you want to wait in a long line and try the fairfax sandwich - without any add ons!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best sandwich we have had in on our trip to Vegas. We weren't even finished with the meal when we were planning to return!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try it out in Vegas since I haven't had a chance to try the LA locations.  The line was around the corner but moved at a good pace.

The sandwich was good and our party tried all sorts but I was a bit underwhelmed.  Maybe because I'd heard so much hype.  Don't get me wrong, It's good and simple if you aren't that hungry but a bit over priced for a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Eggslut. You had me at Eggslut.

When you're on The Strip and you just want a little egg in your life, grab your pearls and top hat and take a stroll on down to The Cosmopolitan--or as I call it, Dat Mopo.

The Eggslut is located on the second floor of Dat Mopo going on The Strip North if you're coming from The Shops at Crystals (fancy, you). It's right past the homeless man with the cardboard sign that reads \"Need cash to get drunk with loose women.\" This is an honest-to-god landmark, so look for it if you get lost.

The Eggslut is a busy little open kitchen with parallel counter seating across its high-end food court layout. We ordered three sandwiches, a cookie and a biscuit. 

I had The Gaucho which is [regurgitated from menu]: seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun. This was delicious, though my Asian-fusion inspired tongue demands all sandwich eggs to be runny as heck. Still, the egg was soft and moist and mixed in well with the red onions and sweet pillowy mouthfeel of the brioche bun.

I also got to try the house-made buttermilk biscuit which came with maple syrup and butter. We got our food take-away (as they say in London) and so maybe this would've been better hot and fresh but it was a little dry and there was nothing seemingly special about the butter and syrup. We also got THE COOKIE which is described as \"dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt, baked fresh every morning.\" I'm not an expert on salt. I know there is salt with an umbrella on the label, and Hawaiians have a salt, and I know \"sale\" is salt in Italian (thanks DuoLingo!). So, I don't know what is gray salt. Whatever gray salt is, IT MADE THIS COOKIE DAMN GOOOOOD. Gray Salt Cookies 4 Life.

Thanks Eggslut. Now I'm no longer only all about that bass, I'm all about that \"GRAY SALT COOKIES 4 LIFE\" Life."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place since it started in LA but the lines are insane. Since they just opened Venice and soon to be Glendale, things should be better. But luckily I stayed at the Cosmo and woomp, there it is. I did not have the most recommended sandwich but the egg salad sandwich since those are my favorite. And so glad I did. So so so good."}
{"text":"I love the food at Eggslut but had a bad experience at this particular location. Today is a Tuesday morning.. a Tuesday and the service is sub par. The girl at the counter calling out customer names when the food was ready was inattentive. My order was ready and sitting right next to her and she literally left it and walked up to the register. By the time we finally received our food, we sit down to eat and my boyfriend found a hair in his sandwich. So gross. And very disappointing since it was his first time here and I spoke highly of the establishment. Will not be back to this location. Not worth the wait in line for this kind of service, should have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Warning, the wait is long. My cousin and I waited 30 minutes, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ok this was a little while ago but... I came here after a night at the club. It's so convenient you know? So anyways I was so damn hungry and my sister was in line to order so I sat down and waited. While I was sitting a worker dropped off a burger in front of me soo I thought it was mine. So I start devouring this burger with my friend and then this lady working there snatches the burger from me and throws it in the trash.... (I guess it was not mine) I mean it was half eaten she could've just let us eat it no??? Well I give this place 3 stars because I got to eat half a burger for free and the free entertainment from all the drunk people walking by was great. Sorry eggslut won't happen again."}
{"text":"This is located 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan.

Absolutely nothing special.  The name Egg Slut catches everyone's eyes, but in reality an egg sandwich is an egg sandwich - $10 - $15 for an egg sandwich is pretty expensive.

Slut - is their specialty item - $10 for a shot of steamed egg and mashed potatoes - for a shot that doesn't come with liquor - now I call that expensive!

Seating are also limited.  It's really hard to eat a runny egg sandwich standing."}
{"text":"Been to the ones in LA but we wanted breakfast and didn't want traditional sit down style so decided to stop by here.

Line was around the corner, maybe 20 people deep or so. Only took about 15 minutes to get to the front.

Got a bacon/egg, a gaucho and a slut with two oj's.

Took about 10 mins to get food, so not bad.

We ate there and everything was great. Tasted just like the other visits in LA."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place for eggs in all of Vegas period!
Tons of selections. My favorite is the burger!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try eggslut in LA but it was too busy! Came to Las Vegas for the weekend and didn't know they had one here at the cosmopolitan. My girlfriend got the sausage and egg sandwich and I got the gaucho with the steak. OMG! Best breakfast sandwich ever!"}
{"text":"This is a do not miss...do not miss unless you hate eggs of course. But if you are a egg lover like us, you should not hesitate. Got here at 1:45pm missing the madness of the lunch rush. Casino was popping, three story chandelier across the way and a hookah smoking caterpillar let's you know you've almost made it.
   Order an eggslut, don't be a fool, get two if you like to eat. Get extra toast. Grab a sandwich as well, I like the Fairfax with bacon. Then find a seat and wait, impatiently wait. Your stomach grumbles, you get jealous as others get theirs, and it takes a short minute because it's made to order. They call your name get back to your seat..dig in...dip your toast, spread the poached egg and mashers all over it like butter. Dip some more..dip again.. breathe..you've now been changed forever. Soak it all in..because whatever you were before, you are an eggslut now...
Strong four..almost a five...fricking on the level. Nuff said.."}
{"text":"Shorter lines compared to Los Angeles. We got the Fairfax sandwiches and the slut. The slut was delicious even though it's pretty much a poached egg with potatoes in a jar, and the Fairfax is a sandwich with an egg...that's it. :)"}
{"text":"Something very unusual happened, Yelpers let me down! I made my way down to the The Cosmopolitan, waited in line for a good 20 minutes even though it was 7am....in Vegas, when I finally got to the counter, it took me less than a minute to place my order, so I have no idea why the line was moving so slow, the menu is very small, but regardless, the food did not justify my wait. 

I ordered the legendary \"The Slut\" - cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette....Sounds interesting and delicious right??? ---- Well, it's ONE SMALL poached egg on top of a bit of bland mashed potatoes with 3 small, toasted but cold pieces of bread, for $10. Quiet the disappointment. The cute name and serving doesn't distract me from the bland flavor, at this over-hyped place."}
{"text":"I've heard all the rage about Eggslut from LA so I was excited to see a location in LV. The Cosmo has definitely turned super trendy with all these restaurants popping up, including Momofuku and Milk. Well, you definitely won't miss Eggslut on the 2nd floor across Marquee because of its 1. name and 2. the long, long line. The weekend I went and passed by, there was constantly a line that winds around the corner. 

I honestly wasn't exactly impressed with the food. It was just average, and nothing memorable. It could be because I ordered the wrong thing. I ordered \"the slut\" which was disappointing... I should have ordered a sandwich. I really don't know what's so great about this place, other than the name...

Also, food takes awhile and the orange juice was just okay, even though everyone on Yelp says to order it..."}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying and worth the price. Sandwiches range from $8-15. I recommend the egg & bacon because of their thickly cut bacon that's seals the sandwich altogether tbh & the fairfax comes with a very fluffy and tasty/sweet scramble!!! It is satisfying enough for one sandwich that doesn't feel too indulgent!"}
{"text":"I'm used to 2.99 egg, cheese and choice of meat on a roll brekkie sandwiches so wasn't sure if 8.99 for one would be worth it. 

So skipped the sammies here and ordered the aptly named \"slut\" :cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of toasted baguette.
Overall dish was nicely presented, the soft coddled egg and pureed potatoes were nicely seasoned and balanced well together. 

I don't feel the price point is good in the least bit but the if that isn't a concern for you, then definitely a place to go in Vegas for a solid breakfast."}
{"text":"Yum. Just f'ing yum. This place is in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas and is my go to for \"oh shit I need some food in my belly because I drank like a fish last night\"... so here's the run down:

~ food is amazing 
~ lines is long, but worth wait
~ menu is simple but expansive
~ easy access if you're staying at the Cosmo
~ staff is AMAZINGLY helpful and courteous
~ coffee is good
~ get the bacon, add the avocado. Seriously.

If you go to Vegas and don't eat at the Eggslut you definitely have missed out"}
{"text":"4.5 to be honest. Not sure why is has a low rating the food is BOMB! 

The slut- just feels like something sinful. So rich and delicious the only thing is that it could be improved upon by adding some crispy bacon or something to it. But seriously so addicting. Scooped up every last bit from the jar. No shame. 

The gaucho-holy hell. This is what dreams are made of. With my addiction to steak and chimichurri there's no wonder I loved this sandwich. so balanced and delicious 

Arugula salad-simple arugula with Parmesan cheese. Can someone please tell me what this dressing is? It's addicting! Also a great addition when you're hungover and need something fresh in your life 

Sample the Fairfax and it was standard, nothing too crazy but I would just stick to the slut and gaucho and be content"}
{"text":"Thank god for Eggslut!! My friend and her family took a trip to Vegas back in April. I was just in Vegas for business and she told me before I flew out that this place was a must visit. My coworker and I went to Eggslut around 9 am Sunday morning. There was a line as expected. It goes pretty fast though since you just have to walk up to the register, order your food, and wait for them to call your name.

The first day I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese. The brioche bun was so soft and really big. The bacon was cooked to crispy perfection and the cheese and over medium egg combo left the sandwich filled with flavor. They do put sriracha ketchup on the bun which takes the sauce level up a notch. I would highly recommend this one over the sausage, egg and cheese which I got Wednesday morning. The sausage, egg and cheese comes with turkey sausage, over medium egg, cheese and honey mustard aioli. This wasn't nearly as saucy as the first one. I wouldn't recommend the orange juice, but I still have that bacon, egg and cheese on my mind!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good, if not a bit overhyped breakfast sandwich featuring, you guessed it, eggs. The bacon, egg, and cheese was tasty with each individual component being quite good. The bread was a bit soggy though. The iced coffee is quite good and I would almost go back just for that. If only the line weren't so long. It may be the NJ in me, but I definitely didn't think it was worth the wait. Still, it's one of the few places in Las Vegas you can get a good breakfast sandwich and not a huge buffet."}
{"text":"The line is Intimidating at first but moves pretty fast breakfast sandwich was good I must say"}
{"text":"Really good. But maybe slightly not worth the wait and money. Not mad we tried it, but unlikely to make the effort to return. Still, it's good and worth a try."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this place and was really disappointed! I was warned about the line, so I got there before I was hungry and waited 45 minutes. I ordered the Fairfax and and my boyfriend ordered something that I forgot the name of. It was extremely bland. I have heard so many good things that I want to give it a try again, but it's not worth waiting in the line."}
{"text":"Eggslut is a great choice for breakfast and brunch at a reasonable price. Located one floor above the casino at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, it is a central location no matter where you are at on the Las Vegas Strip. 

The line to order can get a little long at times, you'll notice the line forks to the hallway leading to the restrooms to the left of the restaurant. However, the staff moves very quickly and moves through the line quickly. 

For menu choices, they have a variety of breakfast sandwiches, along with their specialty, the Slut. All entree choices are below $10. We ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, which was a large portion and was really flavorful. We didn't get anything to drink. We asked for ice water, and were told they didn't have it there, but we could get it from any bar. We were able to get ice water from the Chandelier bar, immediately behind the restaurant.

If you're looking for a cheap but tasty breakfast, give Eggslut a shot!"}
{"text":"Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  I have heard such amazing things about the Eggslut in LA & when I heard there was one in Vegas, I was like \"I must go!\"  But...  it was meh, average.

Located in The Cosmopolitan, near Marquee.  The line was long & we waited about 30 minutes on a Friday afternoon.  Not too many places to dine but their food is quick to eat that seats opened up quickly.

Bacon, Egg, & Cheese:  Okay.  I did enjoy that the bacon was extra crispy.  Served on a brioche bun.  The differences between this & the Sausage, besides the meat, are the sauces which were okay too.
Sausage, Egg, & Cheese:  Okay.
Buttermilk Biscuit:  I did enjoy this!  Fluffy, moist, buttery."}
{"text":"The name alone popped at me. I love eggs so why not try it. Damn I am glad that I did. It's quick service name calling style. The seating area was not the cleanest u guess because of how messy the eggs get. Besides that. Staff was fast with the food and my gosh was it delicious. I had a potato puree mixed with scallions and egg. It was unreal. Very interesting mix. It comes with hard bread to dip into or smear it on. Recommend if you are in the are. Don't go OUT of your way"}
{"text":"A+ for creativity, I can't get over how funny the name is. It's a great bring optioexperiencet was a unique dish. I'm only giving it 4/5 because the line was too long and it was overpriced for the eggs and potato you're getting. Definitely worth going to once for the experience, but not something I would make a habit of going to."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by if you want a quick breakfast... just make sure you get their early. We got there around 9:30am & the line was wrapped around the corner. It took about 25 minutes but it was worth the wait. You order from the front & they have a handful of seats on the side but seats were opening up because it's kind of a stop & go place. I had their slut & bacon &a egg sandwich which I recommend!!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday morning after a long night out on the strip since I desperately needed some breakfast food. Pretty good place, but expensive for what it is.

Let's start with accessibility. Easy to get there, and easy parking at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the strip, so take 15 and you're there!

I ordered the Gaucho sandwich. For $14, you basically get a rather small but pretty good sandwich. The menu there is unfortunately rather limited with only a very few other options. There are basically only 8 main options in total which is very little...

I would say that this is a pretty good place, but I would advise you to go only if you are already in the area and really craving some rather simple breakfast sandwiches. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"The orange juice very bad! The sandwich we have are the Bacon, egg and cheese and the Cheeseburger, the eggs are good but too spice!"}
{"text":"Defintely worth the wait in line.  May have to take it to go since they lack sufficient seating but wow soooooo yummy!  I ordered the suasage egg sandwich.  The bread melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"We tried the Gaucho & Fairfax. Fairfax is alright, Gaucho is sub-par, the beef was dry and tough. The bun are OILY!

With all the burger joints we have in New York, i'll just rate the sandwiches average. Sure, i'll go again if im up for a quite bite and if there were no line."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches. Line is usually long in the morning so try to get there early . The ketchup on the basic egg cheese and bacon sandwich is a little strange so if you're not huge on ketchup get it without. My boyfriend got the waygu beef sandwich and it was delicious! Coffees are small so I would get the fresh squeeze OJ and grab a coffee somewhere else after. Overall good breakfast and would come back"}
{"text":"I really dont understand the hype of this place. Went early on a Sat morning, about 30 minutes before opening time so I didn't have to wait long. Was actually first in line and ordered 4 breakfast sandwiches. Got mine and was excited to try it because of the rave reviews. Took one bite and asked my friend if my egg was supposed to be cooked well done. He said the yolk was supposed to be runny, which it definitely was not. The bread they use is also not ideal, wasn't amazing or anything. The chef made me a new sandwich, which tasted slightly better now that the yolk was runny, but overall, still did not get WOWed by this place. Would not come back. So many other delectable spots in vegas for breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Im not fan or runny eggs so I skipped out on their namesake dish. I heard it was sinfully delicious though. The mix of mashed potatoes, runny egg goodness and lots of salty and savory flavors. I went with the Fairfax. It was a step above your normal egg sandwich. It had scrambled eggs and chives with cheddar cheese and caramelized onions. It packed a nice kick with sriracha mayo which was the best part for me. The line for this one gets pretty long but it's an order and pick up sort of spot so it goes by fast."}
{"text":"It was okay! Customer service seemed bland. Food was good but would hesitate to come back to for a 2nd time. Same thing as the one in LA but customer service is different."}
{"text":"Fabulous food great service wonderful employees very unique restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"All the hype. All the rave reviews.  Left me all disappointed. First we stood in a very long line, luckily it moves rather quickly. Lines this long the food must be legit. Ordered a bacon, eggs and cheese, a sausage,  egg,  and cheese, oj,coffee and a cookie. Didn't take that long for our sandwiches to be ready.  First bite, the egg came oozing out... but it was not hot and delightful...lukewarm at best. It tasted like how I imagine regret would taste. This place is another way to lose money in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's an ok place, seems disorganized and orders are skipped.

The SLUT is just that a slut, seems exciting but all it is a slut."}
{"text":"All I can say is the fairfax with sausage is an excellent sandwich.  It's a breakfast sandwich but different than most it has a spicy sauce and runny scrambled eggs rather than an egg that pops.  The eggs with the cheese worked very well and the addition of turkey sausage really worked.  The brioche bun of course is always a plus when doing breakfast.  For $11 the price is steep, especially considering the size.  Quality is there but it just needs to be bigger to more or less be a scrambled egg brunch meal, then worth the price point.

I came at noon on a monday and the line was about 10-15 minutes.  I get a seat immediately though.  The wait time really all depends on if you go during peak breakfast hours or not.  Otherwise it really isn't that much different than a typical restaurant wait."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Eggslut but was a little apprehensive when I showed up to a long line. First you order your food, then you have to stand around for them to call your name, then hope you can find a seat. Is it worth it? hell yes! I had the Fairfax Sandwich (Cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) that I added Bacon too. Oh my goodness it was amazing. I never thought I'd be that excited about an egg sandwich. Add in the stylish decor, huge light fixture made from mixer beaters, and some awesome tunes and it was a great place to start our last day in Vegas."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place my last morning in Vegas. The location was pretty easy to find and the menu was simple to understand. The line stretching around the corner and down the hall was extreme and had me second guessing my decision. The end of the line to the counter to place my order took about ten minutes and the staff was friendly. After placing my order (2 sandwiches) it took another ten minutes to receive my order. The food was hot as everything is cooked by order and the taste was what I expected, but the portion was smaller than I thought. I left not hungry but not fully satisfied. The long line and the price I paid didn't equal to the end result in my opinion."}
{"text":"Long line aside (which is typical for the one in LA too)....egg sandwiches are high quality.  Worth the wait and enjoyed every bite!!!"}
{"text":"Delish! Fairfax with bacon and avocado! The line looked really long but it moved fast. OJ and Cold Brew was also very good!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Eggslut in LA once so when I went to Vegas and learned that they had one in the Cosmo, I was totally down. It gets busy in the morning and probably after clubbing since it is right across from Marquee but I went at an odd hour and was 3rd in line. I ordered the Slut, which like the other locations, is whipped potatoes topped with a soft boiled egg with a side of toast. I felt that the Slut was better than the one I had in LA. The potato to egg ratio felt right and you can taste the richness of the egg more in this version. I downed the dish in amount 5 minutes and although pricey, it's a meal to treat yourself with in the morning. I would definitely not suggest this particular dish for an after-clubbing meal. You need more sustenance than this... Go for the sandwiches after the club. I was very happy with my meal and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good but a little pricey and long lineups. The Slut was my favourite and the sandwiches are good too"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and I decided to try this place for lunch. Everywhere is pricey, so I didn't cry when I paid $25 for a side salad, cheeseburger, and water. 

I have to say though, damn that burger was sexy. I didn't realize it had an egg on the cheeseburger, but it was perfect. The brioche bun was also fresh and divine. The egg in the burger was cooked with a runny yolk. The side salad was arugula with a very tart vinaigrette. 

Be prepared to wait a bit but the food is worth it. Seating is also limited."}
{"text":"Honestly the best bacon, egg and cheese sandwich I've ever had. It is really mouth watering if you like breakfast samdwiches. The only bad part is the line that forms thats wraps into the hallway. I guess when you have a product like that you have to expect it."}
{"text":"Im a frequent slut in L.A. So I was super excited for it to finally be coming to Vegas. Its located on the second floor of the Cosmo next to holstiens ans across of marquee. The line is super long and wraps around so be ready to wait a while. 

I typically order the slut which comes in a glass jar with a potato puree, chives n salt. $10 with 3 slices of baguettes. My slut must have been made by a mad person cuz it was hella salty!!! (see what I did there Lol)

The reason I gave 3 stars is cuz they really need to hire a cleaner. People are nasty and I get tourists are lazy and on vaca but its a mess. They have counter seating and its all sticky n gross. There's jars all over cuz people don't know if they should return it or throw it away so they just leave em."}
{"text":"I really like this place!!! Fun name Great tunes jamming at 8:30am. Best fresh squeezed OJ!! I took off one star Bc I wish they had some sort of a side to order. Sandwich was not enough & I did not want a cookie for a side. I really liked my turkey sausage sandwich tho. Would go back for another!!!"}
{"text":"This was another find on Yelp and thanks to our success with Bruxie we decided to give this one a go as well. I'm a sucker for a good breakfast sandwich so I was all for trying Eggslut. We somehow missed the fact that this is located in the Cosmopolitan so we got a bit lost trying to find it but nothing major. When we got there the line was wrapped along the wall and down a side hallway. We overheard someone say that they were told that the wait would only be about 30 mins so we decided to wait and they were right. After you order, your food takes about 5/10 mins to come out so it wasn't bad at all. My boyfriend and I both loved the ingredients that were on the Fairfax but we wanted the wagyu tri-tip steak. Luckily the cashier was accommodating and able to ring us up for the Gaucho with all of the Fairfax fixings. It was a great choice! The steak was tender and flavorful. The sweetness from the caramelized onions and bun went well with the sandwich. The vibe was awesome. Everyone was very friendly and all of the cooks and manager were singing/dancing along to the music. Since we're from Cleveland, we loved the fact that they played Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. I ordered the fresh-squeezed orange juice and it was delish. Only con is that the prices are a little high for just a sandwich and they don't really have any side dishes. However, I still highly recommend and will be back during my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I read so many good reviews about this place when I was planning on places to visit in LV and had to check it out myself. Believe me , they lived the reputation of awesomeness!! 

For breakfast time, of course there's going to be a line, but it moved quick. While you're waiting there's a huge billboard of the menu so you know exactly what you want when you get to the register. My boyfriend and I got the Cheeseburger with
Avocado, a slut and bacon egg and cheese. The slut was different, but it was amazing on the toast. I just wished they gave more bread!! LOL
The sandwiches were good. Eggs cooked perfect!! I would totally keep going back for breakfast"}
{"text":"I got the egg, sausage and cheese sandwich.  It was good, but I feel like the place was so hyped making my expectations so high that when I got my food after waiting about 15-20 min in line it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, but still good.  Small cup of OJ was $5, maybe that's just because this location is on the strip however.  If you're going to go, go early in the day to skip the line."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast sandwich.  I ordered mine on a biscuit instead of brioche bun and it was literally the best Breakfast sandwich I've ever had.   If the line is long no worries because it does move fast and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I can definitely see how this is a popular spot. Great for young college kids or people not looking to spend a grip on a buffet breakfast. Nice breakfast sandwiches on fresh bread. I recommend asking for no ketchup it comes standard on sandwiches and I don't like ketchup. Right outside of the club and affordable. $8.50 avg per sandwich. I was hoping there would be more on the menu but they are popular for the egg \"slut\" and that is what they specialize in. Do not buy their coffee. It's $5 and not good. Just grab one from Starbucks on your way or right after you get your food."}
{"text":"Yelpers are really ganging up and giving this slut quite a pounding.

I know it's Vegas and all, but there's something to be said for easing up and not being so stiff... with criticism, at times. 

For the last few years, I've been getting breakfast from Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood, so I welcome having Eggslut just across the street at The Cosmopolitan as an alternative.  Earl's tends to slightly burn their buns, whereas Eggslut's brioche buns are bigger and better.

I recommend THE FAIRFAX ($8). Although it's a breakfast sandwich, it comes with a fork, because it can get really, ahem, loose and messy with soft scrambled eggs and other ingredients (such as sriracha mayo, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions) coming out of it. I also added avocado ($2). This sandwich doesn't blow me...away (nor do I expect that), but it's packed with flavors and it's nice to have another quick and casual option on The Strip.

I'm not a fan of long lines either, especially for a slut I've already hit...up a few times in LA, but it was only about a 10 min wait on a Monday morning around 8:30. Sometimes when a restaurant expands there's a concern they're spreading themselves too thin, but the food here tasted the same as what I've had in LA (which is basically food truck style).

MAIN DIFFERENCES FROM DTLA LOCATION:
-no bar counter seating here, but there is a communal table 
-rather than having Broadway as the backdrop, they have The Chandelier 
-longer hours (open til 7p) and slightly higher prices

The best part about Egglut being inside Cosmo? Instead of finishing on the spot, I can take this slut back to my room. Woooooooo!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best eggs I have had in a while! The Namesake \"eggslut\" is basically a poached egg on top of creamy mashed potatoes served with toasted baguette slices and when you dip them into the egg, the yolk oozes and forms a sublime curry like mixture. I got a side salad of arugula with red wine balsamic dressing and manchego cheese which I felt went very well with the Eggslut. My husband got the Fairfax Sandwich with turkey sausage which was also really really good. The scrambled eggs in the sandwich were ooey-gooey and seasoned to perfection.

Breakfast of champions!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich. After a few delicious bites, I realized something was missing: the egg! How you gonna call yourself Eggslut and not include the egg??? I went back to the counter to tell them and they were really nice about it. They made another sandwich free of charge so I decided that omelette that slide. 

Despite the eggless fiasco, I would come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas. I also tried my friend's Slut order and that tasted like an instant hangover cure. Their orange juice was refreshing as well."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original in La. Even better when its comp'd."}
{"text":"Easiest 5 stars EVER! Can we talk about the fairfax? Oh mah gaawww! Its like heaven in your mouth! I devoured it and could have easily eaten two! Ordered mine with avocado and bacon. A little overpriced for a breakfast sandwich but still amazeballs. The brioche is perfection. The soft scrambled eggs, mmmmm. Must try!!"}
{"text":"What to say about eggslut.... this is a tough one. I'm from Los Angeles and I'll tell you the location over there is much better and it's essentially for one reason and one reason only, PRICE POINT. At the same time it makes sense because we are in Vegas and the location itself is in the cosmopolitan! 

The sandwich itself was extremely good. I had the sausage egg sandwiches with added avocado. The total came out to 15 dollars for the sandwich and a cup of orange juice. Nothing amazing about the juice itself but the sand which definitely hit the spot after a long night of partying. Just the right amount of applewood smoked bacon and avocado, and the ketchup was extremely good as well. 

All in all I would recommend it if you have plenty of time. The line always stretches around the place itself and will take you about 30 minutes to order and get your food. Is it worth the wait? I personally don't think so. 4stars for the sandwich being good."}
{"text":"Eggslut is just the type of breakfast place I needed to add into my life! Love that the LA brand made it to Las Vegas!! If you love egg sandwiches as much as me this is a must have!"}
{"text":"It pains me to do this but...

After coming here a few times (with great experiences) I chose Eggslut for breakfast while having friends in town. We waited in line then when it came our turn to order we should have run for the hills.
I ordered the Gacho sandwich with no bread and no dairy. I specifically asked her if there was any type of cheese and she said no. The cashier asked me if I wanted to turn that into a salad, I said sure. My friend ordered the bacon eggslut sandwich.
Upon receiving our order I asked the guy who delivered it what the white stuff covering the salad was. He said cheese.
I returned it because I told them I couldn't have dairy (I'm on a very strict diet right now) and he got the cashier to come over. She told me she said there wasn't dairy on the sandwich, she never said there wasn't cheese on the salad.

Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? In front of a ton of other guests mind you. I told her I'd gladly pay for another order but I absolutely cannot have dairy. They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order. 
I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm. Even my boyfriend Andy who NEVER complains commented how cold it was.
Also my friends bacon on his sandwich was so burnt you could pinch it and it fell apart. Completely charred.

Fast forward 5 hours later... food poisoning. I will never return."}
{"text":"Was looking for a breakfast/brunch place and found this on yelp. Was not disappointed! I had the Gaucho Sandwich and it was so tasty!! The wagyu was cooked so perfectly and the chimichurri sauce was just the right touch. You also can never go wrong with a brioche bun. Just so soft and perfect for this sandwich. Wanted to try the homemade biscuit but thought that was too much bread for me so I will try it the next time I come back.
There was a little wait  down the hall but it did not take as long as the person in line told us. Maybe 20 minutes top before we had our food in our hands. 
Will definitely come here again the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on our last day at vegas and it was really good! Its cheap and fast also lines do get long but you don't wait a long time to order will definitely stop by again when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"We hit it at a relatively slow time. Wait was maybe ten minutes. Smooth operation. We sampled the Fairfax, with and without bun, and the egg slut.
After the order, the wait for the food was a couple minutes, but hey, they are making it while you wait!
The counter woman explained how to mix up the egg slut for best results.
The results?
The Fairfax with bun was rich and creamy and addictive. The salad approach doesn't work as well, but then you ate a little healthier.
The egg slut was interesting but not as appealing to me as the Fairfax.
We snagged a couple seats and we were lucky, it would not be fun to have to find a place to sit in the Cosmo and eat it.
They lived up to the advanced billing. We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Overpriced but good. I'm from New York so I know a good bec. I recommend the Fairfax with bacon."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich eggsluts are a bit expensive but won't regret it got to try it"}
{"text":"It is a good spot to get your morning sammy on...I go with the bacon,egg,cheese, but the fairfax is good too...I like my bacon on the chewy side and they always nail it....but at around $9 it is pricey...and truth be told I could get an egg Mcmuffin for like $2...but I was staying at the Cosmo and it was right out side the elevator so there you go.  And a super plus that the price in vegas is the same as the OG in LA...well i guess that doesn't say much lol!"}
{"text":"IT HONESTLY DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS. I know it's just a breakfast sandwich but in all honestly, I'm never going to look at a breakfast sandwich the same way ever again. Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor so if you're checking this beautiful place out, then check out Eggslut as well or you're missing out on the whole Cosmopolitan experience. We went here for breakfast on a Tuesday and the line went around the corner. The line went by pretty quick though so don't let the long line fool you into not going. I got the sausage egg sandwich and the OJ. If you're dining there, there isn't much seating but seats turnover pretty quick so if you don't mind waiting or scouting out a few seats, you should eat there. 
I know it's going to sound like an exaggeration but this breakfast sandwich was SO good. The first bite and you could taste all the flavors on your taste buds. I don't know what they put in these things, but it's freaking delicious. I don't know what more I can say about this. The sausage, the egg, the cheese, some type of mayo sauce and the bread. SO GOOD. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I'm sure. It keeps you full. I wasn't hungry until about a couple hours before dinner. The OJ was also good! I don't know what it is, but my time in Vegas, I was super dehydrated. The OJ definitely hit the spot and you can tell that it isn't artificial which is a plus .Definitely worth the time and money to go here if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Had the Fairfax as a salad instead of a sandwich, added avocado and asked for a bun on the side - came out to $11. Note: this is not something they do (give buns on the side), but they were gracious enough this morning to give me one! 

The soft scramble was tasty with the melted cheese, but a $2 charge for avocado was a bit overkill considering it wasn't even sliced and bruised. As an overall package this was a quick, tasty and satisfying breakfast - but expect a line and a wait for your order to be prepared. And this was at 7:45am on a Tuesday. If you're staying at the Cosmo and don't want to go too far, it's a safe (and overpriced) bet."}
{"text":"Don't be mislead by the long line wrapped around the restaurant, it goes by reasonably fast and it's worth it! I ordered the Fairfax ($8.50) with avocado (+$2). You can also add fresh cut bacon (the guy was literally cutting it right in front of us)for an extra $3. This sandwich hit the spot. I love the fresh brioche bun that it is served with. The chives, caramelized onions, melted cheese, and chipotle mayo all paired well together. I would definitely order this again!"}
{"text":"love love loveeee it!!! came here after dancing and drinking at marquee! it's opened 24 hours! i would definitely come again!!! everyone should try it!!!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. I really love the name and was thrilled to give it a whirl. The line was relatively short on Thursday at noon-ish. The service was \"okay\" however I was happy to get to specialize my sandwich with no meat and added arugula. The orders were prepared correctly and we didn't have to wait long. My lunch date thought the presentation could have been better, but it was a casual to-go type eatery so I was fine with the seemingly, eco-friendly containers and wrappers. The reason for the three stars is because the brioche bun was dry (stale?) and it really impacted the sandwich in a big way. A fresh, soft bun makes a BIG difference! I would try this place again, but if I got another stale bun, I'd probably ask for a redo (even though I hate to be \"that gal/guy\")."}
{"text":"IMO it's good, not super stellar out of this world, but good and a nice change from the usual breakfast fare. I went when there was no line. Not sure I'd wait in a long line for this food. Ingredients were fresh and good quality. The Fairfax (soft-scrambled egg with caramelized onion, and cheddar on brioche) with added bacon, was a nice, hearty sandwich. A bit too much sriracha mayo on it for me, though. I had an odd experience with the Slut (poached egg over potato puree in a jar with chive and sea salt, served with toast). I really did not like the first bite...but I kept eating, and the more bites I had, the more I liked it. Lol. After eating it, I decided I liked it more than the Fairfax. Go figure. We also got a salted chocolate cookie. It was good, but seemed expensive at $4.50.

Counter service. Limited seating.

Overall, a good place to get an egg sandwich if the line isn't too long. Expect Vegas hotel prices (like $8 for the Fairfax sandwich, $11 if you add bacon). I would go back to try their other sandwiches. A-OK."}
{"text":"Line wrapped into the hallway by the restrooms. Was 1 hour line. Food was good but not worth the money at all. 50 bucks for 2 breakfast sandwiches and sodas is a bit much. Even in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am officially obsessed with Eggslut. Serving up delicious egg sandwiches and of course the namesake of the restaurant, the \"Slut,\" this place gets long lines and if you try it, you'll see why.

My favorite sandwich to get here is the Gaucho, which involves wagyu tri-tip and chimichurri sauce. The bread on all of the sandwiches is soft, fluffy and is the perfect breakfast bread. I also love getting the Slut. It's mind-blowingly good. A coddled egg is placed on top of a jar of Robuchon (re: SUPER buttery) mashed potatoes. You mix it all together and the egg kind of cooks in with the potatoes. Spread that on the provided toast and you have a party in your mouth. I like getting the arugula salad to put on top of that.

The only bad thing about Eggslut is you can't really get out of there without spending around $20/person for a grab and go breakfast. Also the line. Just try to go on off-peak times (afternoon, early morning...)

There aren't too many seats, so head to the Chandelier bar nearby if you can't find seating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the hangover spot of the year... The ingredients are all fresh and the Oj is very good.  The line can get long, but not at 4 am where the place is ingenuously located and opens and 12am!!  I really like the breakfast sandwiches and the convenience  is key!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overhyped, and underwhelming, but still a solid hangover cure. Stick with the sandwiches and skip the Slut. 

The lines were long when we visited at 11am in the morning, wrapping around the counter where customers order. 

The sandwiches were pretty expensive, with additional costs for customization. I tried the Slut and the Bacon Egg and Cheese.

The food came out pretty slowly. Overall, it took around 30-45 minutes to order and get my food - definitely not a fast endeavor. Additionally, they don't have cups for water; only expensive bottles. There is only one bar table with like 10 seats. 

The sandwich was honestly pretty good, but not amazing. The Slut was mediocre and bland.

I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Love the fact that they even offered gluten-free options. I got the fairfax with arugula salad instead of the brioche buns. The eggs were sooo soft and creamy. It was perfectly seasoned. The acidity from the red wine vinaigrette really balanced out the creamy eggs. This was seriously the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. 

We also got the cheeseburger, bacon egg & cheese, as well as the sausage egg & cheese. The winner was the cheeseburger! Looking back, we should've just ordered 3 of the cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Wow!
I'm a believer and a super impressed first time customer.

Walked past the downtown Grand place couple years back in LA and thought, how special are coddled eggs, or chives?

Uhh-- so mistaken.

It's spendy for the portion, but the few bites of the brioche medley will transport you to someplace very very satisfying 

Fairfax, bacon egg& cheese, fresh OJ

U will be a satisfied breakfast patron. Now open into the early evenings"}
{"text":"I love Eggslut. The line is very long, no matter what time you arrive, but don't fret: it actually moved really quickly so stay put. What's nice is that because everyone waits to grab a seat until they have food, there is always a place to sit. That being said, don't be the ass who hogs a table and a bunch of chairs while your party is still in line. It's just not cool. 

The food is fantastic. No matter what you order, it will be great. I also appreciate that the coffee is decent."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the inefficient set up and process , it would get a full 5 stars ... but the lines are always so long and they are obviously understaff to meet the demands and crowds ... patience is the key at this place"}
{"text":"Decent, wasn't crazy about the wait though. I'd rather have gone to a buffet. Prices are decently high, and if you eat a lot I'd suggest against it. There wasn't really anything in this that wow'ed me which might be due to how much friends had hyped up the place, but also just the richness that I had wanted from the egg slut and the fluffiness of the eggs in the fairfax just weren't really there. The wait time was roughly 35 mins, and wait for food was roughly 15 to 20 since they were behind on egg sluts at the time. 

So yeah, I had ordered the egg slut and the fairfax with avocado. I probably should have gotten the spicy mayo on the side to bolster things in retrospect. The fairfax was decent with the avocado, the spicy mayo didn't pop as much as I wanted. The carmelized onion was few and far between in the sammich. Balance thrown out the window for speed. Subbed ketchup eventually instead to curb the taste as a whole. The egg slut was also kinda nifty, but the mash wasn't as rich as I'd like at the bottom.

Overall, not crazy about the place. I'll stick to brunch or a buffet next time I'm in the area and in recovery mode."}
{"text":"Their special, the \"Slut\" was awesome! Perfect portion size. Quick service/not too pricey as well. Salted Choc Chip Cookie is worth trying :)"}
{"text":"All aboard the hype train! Located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is definitely one of the busiest breakfast spots in town. Be ready to wait 15 minutes to order and another 10 to pick up your food! 

Despite my reservations, I ate here twice for good measure.

The first day I went to try this, the line was so long that I bailed. The next day I waited til lunchtime for good measure, and there was no wait at all. It's all in the timing! The classic 'Slut' is the signature dish here, but I was craving that yolky burst, so opted for a sandwich. 

I got the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, which is made with turkey sausage and topped with a honey mustard aioli. It came out quick and fresh, which was almost a con because the cheese didn't fully melt. The egg, listed as over-medium, is actually still super soft in the middle so expect to get yolked on! I found the first few bites very bland, and it wasn't til I hit the yolk, the aioli in the middle, and a couple of more well-seasoned bits of the sausage that I really began to enjoy it. The cheese is weak for me - I'd prefer something with more of a tang. The brioche bun holds up well but I'm not convinced it's the best guy for the job... but maybe that's the Scottish, chewy white bread roll loving girl in me talking.

On day three everyone was too hungover to go out for breakfast, so I braved the long line alone in search of a Slut. After 10 minutes in line I was about to approach the cashier when another staff member came round and said they were out of Sluts and it'd be a 40-minute wait for more. So much for that! I called an audible for the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, almost the same but with bacon instead of sausage and chipotle ketchup instead of aioli. This one had melted more, though annoyingly the bacon was crammed up one end and I burst the yolk out the side while trying to rearrange things. It was more flavorful (and much saltier) than the sausage, and the chipotle ketchup is definitely a better match to balance out the yolk than the aioli was. Again, the bun didn't fully satisfy me, I just don't think it goes as well with the yolk as another more rustic bread might. 

I'm not totally convinced, but still waiting to try that beautiful-looking coddled egg next time!"}
{"text":"The Slut was sooo good!!! For dessert, order the cookie and have them warm it up. Ah-maze-balls.!There was no line and the food came out super quick! Plus all the workers were very friendly!"}
{"text":"We stay at Cosmo frequently and every time we go by Eggslut we say we are going to try it and then we go around the corner and see the long line and we pass. Well this last weekend for some reason I guess all the CES folks had partied too hard and there was virtually no line. So we did it.

I love a good breakfast sandwich and this did not disappoint except for the cost of $8. Do not expect a firm or even over medium cooked egg - the yolk was completely liquid and the white was barely holding together. It looked sunny side up to me. Chipotle catsup was fine. We also ordered 2 biscuits at $5 each and they needed to be much warmer as the butter didn't even melt. I asked for ice water and they would only offer bottled water which was like $4.00 so I went for the $5 OJ - which was not very big.

The counters all needed to be wiped off and were sticky from the maple syrup they serve with the biscuits. Fun trendy vibe, all the kitchen staff wears their snap backs backward - the name is funny - and the music is more hip hop. Would I wait in a long line for this again? Nah, probably not. But I an now agree with others who say - \"have you eaten at Eggslut - it's so good!\" Yep, eaten there and it was good but not SO good."}
{"text":"Love Eggslut!! It's such a simple concept, but the outcome is so delicious. Located in the Cosmopolitan, up the escalator (near Milk Bar). The place didn't seem too crowded when I went around mid-afternoon on Sunday. Probably your best bet to try this place, since the LA location is ALWAYS packed.

My favorite is the Fairfax Sandwich (vegetarian friendly!). it comes packed with scrambled eggs, caramelized onions, cheese and their yummy sriracha mayo sauce. Be sure to keep it wrapped while eating because the egg will most definitely escape from the bottom and sides as you bite through it. The brioche bread is also very light--tastes so much better than regular breads!

Overall, this is a great place for a bite to eat for either breakfast, lunch, or drunchies. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"GET HERE EARLY... the line was super long.... we waited at least 30 minutes....
Ordered the egg sandwich..... great sandwich but the egg was over easy... make sure you order the egg the way you like or they make it the way thru want (RUNNY).... other than that sandwich was good..."}
{"text":"Omg I love sluts. And porn.
To clarify: Eggslut and food porn. 
Only in Vegas is this punniness so fitting and appropriately inappropriate ^^;

Seeing the long line wrap around the corner, I thought Eggslut would be over-hyped, with most customers comprised of either hipster wannabes with an obsessive love for glass jars, or those in need of brunchy hangover therapy. (On weekends, it even opens at midnight so you can get gourmet breakfast for drunchies!)

Despite the potential for an inflated hype factor, the concept of craft eggs still piqued my curiosity and I decided to check it out... and ended up coming here 2 days in a row.

The Slut ($10.82 - a coddled egg on top of smooth potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette): Their signature. Simple in concept as egg and potatoes in a jar with some bread on the side for good measure; complex in reality with the simplicity of homemade mashed potatoes contrasting the orgasmic runny yolk with a sprinkle of earthy chives. Even the baguette is top-notch, tasting like the crostini of high-end restaurants and drizzled with a dash of olive oil. You're supposed to mix the egg/potatoes jar and spread it on the baguette, but I also enjoyed eating part of it separately and less mixed to bring out different flavors. It could do with less salt, but it was otherwise layery goodness.

The Gaucho ($16.22 - seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg): The heartiest menu item. The steak is a bit too salty and may be dry with respect to hard-core steak standards, but for slices in my breakfast it was definitely quality. The combination of tri-tip, chimichurri, and red onions rendered a piquant Argentinian flavor profile, and the egg was more of an afterthought. I suggest getting the salad version because the steak pairs well with the nutty arugula dressed in a tangy, citrusy sauce and a sprinkle of shaved parmesan.

*Note that you can substitute the brioche bun with arugula salad for any of their breakfast sandwiches. 

Service is efficient and friendly, though workers do seem to get chatty amongst themselves. Both times, I waited momentarily in anticipation for my order to be called, after I already saw the food prepared. 

I applaud Eggslut's conscientiousness to sustainability (much needed, especially in light of the new climate-change-denying presidential administration... eww). All boxes and utensils are compostable, and Slut glasses are recycled. Slut glasses? Pun not intended :3

The verdict? Eggcellent! Not your cheapest breakfast, but good value in comparison to the $12 bottled juice and $14 smoothies at Juice Standard next door."}
{"text":"Decent, good food. If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan and don't want to pay 30 bucks a plate for breakfast, this is the place for you.  The waitress this morning had a winning smile and sparkling personality!  We'll be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I probably came here at the wrong time, I was hanging around the strip at 2 am and we got hungry and spotted this place.  Worst customer service ever, they treated everyone with contempt.  It seems like either they don't get paid enough or something else is going on.  Besides the service being bad, the gaucho sandwich just tastes like something is missing because when you bite into it the Tri tip is so dry and it needs some kind of sauce or tomato to lubricate it."}
{"text":"5 stars.... because of their Fairfax sandwich! I love good quality eggs that are not overdone. So many restaurants ruin their eggs but not eggslut. Perfect!!! The bacon or sausage sandwiches are like high quality McDonald's lol. Get the Fairfax! You won't regret :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich, I had the fairfax with bacon. Pretty pricey for our taste, nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and 2 waters, but delicious all the same. Small, but I honestly probably couldn't eat a second one. Would highly recommend trying it at least once since there are so few that exist."}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwich on the strip. Went back a second day in a row. It's quite filling and the price is just right for a restaurant on the strip. Located on the second floor of the Cosmo next to Holsteins."}
{"text":"The waiters are here are super friendly!! Eggs out is always a delicious breakfast! You can never go wrong with it. I usually get the slut and fresh OJ.. Not as busy as the one in LA so you don't have to wait an hour in line"}
{"text":"If you're willing to wait 20-30 minutes for your food, this place is delicious! We got in line around 8 AM for breakfast on a Friday and the line was already wrapped around the building. But I've always wanted to try this place in LA so I was willing to wait. It was definitely worth it.

My husband and I both got egg, bacon, and cheese sandwiches. The buns are perfectly crunchy and buttered and the chipotle ketchup adds so much to what would've been just a plain ol' breakfast sandwich. We got a ton of questions about where we got our food as we carried it back up to our room (at that hour there was no seating available at the restaurant). We would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I went here based off the hype and wasn't impressed. A bit overpriced for a mediocre $10 sandwich and $5 oj. No where to sit for inhouse orders, which leaves you stuck hovering over other people."}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwich.  I had the sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich.  The line was extremely long and around the corner.  It went fairly quick, about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fairfax, said it comes with caramelized onions and spicy mayo and chives and I could not taste any of those 3 flavors. It got over powered by the egg and cheese. :( but my boyfriend ordered the one with the gaucho which was 15 dollars and that was amazing!"}
{"text":"Fairfax with avocado and bacon and fresh squeezed oj. 20 bucks but well worth the price and the 45 minute wait. This place is a must...."}
{"text":"YUM! I have always wanted to try eggslut and finally got to try it after Marquee dayclub. I got the fairfax and it was delicious. The eggs were so fluffy. The spicy mayo had a nice kick to it and everything is always better with avocados. The wait does get a little long but I don't mind. This definitely is one of the better \"fast\" food options in the Cosmo!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was surprisingly so good! I thought it may be overhyped but it turned out to be better than expected. I had the sausage, egg, and cheese. The bread was warm and soft and the cheese was melted just right. Loved how the egg was cooked. The line was pretty long when I got here but it moved super quick and the service is very efficient too! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wow what a name!  The menu looked great and the line was long so it had to be good!  We didn't have time to stay and eat but it looked really good. You should bookmark this one and try it when you get a chance."}
{"text":"If you are in mood for some eggs this is the place to go. I got egg and cheese it was pretty good but a bit too salty. I'll go go back again for sure. :) the staff wasn't too friendly. Cashier was nice but the rest of crew weren't. I'm thinking maybe they have to deal with a lot of drunk people from marquee."}
{"text":"I FINALLY MADE IT TO AN EGGSLUT!!!!

As excited as I was about my trip to Vegas, I was even more excited at the thought that I would finally be able to try a sandwich from Eggslut. Let me tell you... it almost didn't happen because we were staying way down at The Delano and had no intention of eating or doing anything at The Cosmopolitan.

Luckily for me, I went there to do a little gambling and hanging out with my friend while the rest of our group was out at a club nearby. What's even better is that they OPENED AT 12AM. WHAT??? I thought maybe I was catching them at the end of their day and were getting ready to close. LITTLE DID I KNOW, BUT I CAUGHT THEM JUST AS THEY OPENED. I can't even tell you how happy I was. I marched myself right up to the counter and ordered my BEC sandwich and waited excitedly for what I was about to experience.

Honestly, this sandwich was SO GOOD. The eggs, bacon, cheese and chipotle ketchup were PERFECTION. I should've gotten another one just to relive it again. If I ever make it back to LA, I'm definitely hitting up the original location!"}
{"text":"Been dying to come here. On the second floor of the cosmopolitan with a few other restaurants. There's a decent breakfast selection. We got 2 bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches. They were larger than expected and DELICIOUS! $8 a piece. Lots of bacon, runny egg and cheddar cheese on a crisp bun. They make their breakfast sandwiches in bunches. Buns sitting on the grilled topped with cheese then bacon and lastly the egg. Waited for about 15 minutes and there was seating granted it was a Wednesday morning. There were about 30 people eating. Small place with bar like seating. Will be back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Holy Moses!
I couldn't drag myself out of my coffin fast enough, the morning after a night of debauchery, to stand in this mile long line hung over.  I wish the employees on the registers were not trying out for parts in the next \"night of the living dead\" sequel.  By the time I made it up to the register, I wanted to give the guy working the lone register (there were two, but only one was open) a redbull with five hour energy shot.  Note to management: trim the hanging fruit on your tree!  I could go on but I don't want to waste time bitching, I need to get back in line for my next order.
The breakfast sandwiches are worth the wait.  I brought my husband back a sandwich and this enabled him to get vertical so I could drag him to the pool.
He LOVED it too!!
This chef/owner wrote the breakfast sandwich 101 bible on how to make a kick ass breakfast sandwich. SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"With a name like this you have to try it 
I tried the Slut and it was interesting and well done but would not get it again. A small mason jar with puréed potatoes toped with a coddled egg. You stir the egg into the potatoes and eat with a spoon. Each event was perfectly cooked but had a three bland taste. 
The egg sandwiches we're as good as it gets. You will be very happy. 
Tip go early and still expect a line"}
{"text":"Got the Cheese Burger; it was cooked perfectly and the bun was sweet. The Eggslut was also good but nothing spectacular, just baguette and egg/potato soup. Nothing seemed SPECIAL about this meal."}
{"text":"The main event, the eggs, are scrumptious! They are super fluffy and evenly cooked (does Eggslut use a sous vide? because it seems like they do). 

I had the Fairfax sandwich- caramelized onion, chives, cheddar cheese, and siracha mayo on scrambled eggs in a brioche bun- and loved every bit of it. As I said earlier, the scrambled eggs were super fluffy! The brioche bun is freaking delicious, and all the flavors of this sandwich melded well together. Loved the value and experience of this meal. Well worth the $10. 

My friend had the Slut, of course. This egg came in a really cute jar with a creamy pureed mashed potato cushion. Flavors were much subtler. I enjoyed the texture of all components but prefered my sandwich for the flavor and size. Cost was approximately the same between our two dishes. 

Overall really liked this space and the food. There's a big bunny who might remind you of a woman's anatomy and cute cracked-egg chairs! Loved the colors and the vibes. Also appreciated that I could get breakfast for  $10. Vegas food is notoriously expensive so I enjoyed this option whole-heartedly!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass sandwich, simple and to the point. Got the Fairfax and it was everything you want an egg sandwich to be. Worth a trip if you're nearby or it's late at night with no line. Not sure it's worth going out of your way for or waiting on some crazy line. Just a solid egg sandwich with fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in line. Got the Fairfax and added bacon and avocado, along with a Gaucho. The eggs in both sandwiches were cooked right and the brioche buns were soft and buttery. The wagyu tri-tip in the Gaucho was tender."}
{"text":"The line wraps around to the bathroom area - it was long! Took us about 30-40minutes to order our food and WE LOVED IT! Came here twice in a roll because I failed to order the egg slut the first time. We've tried their sausage egg and cheese, fairfax, gaucho, and egg slut. My favorite was the gaucho sandwich and egg slut. Yum! Wish they have this on the east coast."}
{"text":"Vegas - Sin city . . .

Fancy hotels, casinos, nightclubs and . . . sluts.

Yeah - back in Vegas a mere two months from the last trip.  But this time it wasn't business - it was for pleasure (well I had a wedding to attend).  

So where did I find myself - Eggsluts.  Not once, but twice.  Oh the shame . . . paying for Sluts twice in one weekend.  

At least what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas . . ."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot tucked away from the strip. Line can get long but they move pretty quick to get you fed. Small but good menu. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The line for Eggslut goes by quicker than I expected it to but the pick up could be way more efficient. I only had two meals while I was in Vegas and I made sure Eggslut was one of them. It was the perfect quick bite to eat in the three hours inbetween the nightclub and the day club.

Warm brioche buns, fluffy eggs, tangy chipotle sauce and bacon that is cooked to perfection. Not to mention, fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast sandwich and this place delivers!  I had the Fairfax +Bacon, was a little heavy on the mayo but still great, next time I would order mayo on the side.  

Should you wait in line or make a special trip to come here...no
But if you are staying at the Cosmo ifs definitely worth stoppying by when it's slow.

I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews, this place pumps out fresh, made to order, tasty food in a cute atmosphere.  It's relatively fast when there isn't a line and you can watch them cooking while you wait.  They have a quite a system & really rock it out so it's A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"This place, man. 

The name is a bit of a turnoff, but the food has overcome my aversion. It's just so dang good. 

Doesn't matter what you order--the Bacon Egg and Cheese, the Fairfax, the Slut--it's going to be eggy, and it's going to be good. 

The bread they use for the sandwiches is fantastic, but if you're not a bread eater you can sub salad. 

Don't miss the biscuits and the chocolate chip sea salt cookie--both mouth-wateringly delicious. Bonus points if you can get the cookie while it's warm!

It seems like the line is always long, but it moves pretty quickly, and these eggs are totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and I think I have a pretty accurate view of how this place is now. 

So on my first visit, there wasn't a line at all because we came around 3pm I wanna say. This time, it was Sunday noonish and the line wrapped around the corner and down the hall. 

I tried the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on my first visit. They put this chipotle ketchup on it which really made the sandwich excellent. And I can't say that they weren't generous with the bacon. (5/5)

On my second visit, I tried the turkey sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and this was not nearly as good as the bacon one. The flavors weren't really there for me. The turkey sausage was a lot better than I anticipated but I just had high expectations after having the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. (3/5)

My friend order the slut because it seemed to be popular and one of their specialties. I have to say we were really disappointed. I was underwhelmed with my initial bite. First of all, it is overpriced ($10) for a little jar and a few pieces of toast. It basically tasted like watered down mashed potatoes. Not worth the money. It isn't that great in my opinion. 

Drinks here are incredibly expensive too (probably to pay for the rent since it's inside the Cosmo) so BYOB... A small bottle of Smartwater here is $4."}
{"text":"Long wait but line goes by fast. I had the bacon egg croissant and couldn't be more delicious. Would def wait in line for this again."}
{"text":"The name is super funky but the food is fantastic. My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast one of the mornings while we were staying in planet Hollywood in Vegas which is literally a 5 minute walk from the hotel we stayed in. I've seen so many reviews and heard so many things about this place that when I found out that the hotel I was staying at was in walking distance I had to go! My boyfriend got the Gaucho breakfast sandwich that had wagyu steak which was SO good, and I got the bacon, egg, and cheese and we both shared the slut. The food literally had me drooling because it was so good. If I could go back to Vegas again, I would for sure come back to egg slut. Just be sure to come right in the morning because it does get extremely busy."}
{"text":"Ok so all the hype..... is totally worth it!! We waited in line on a Monday for about 45 minutes to get breakfast but hey when you can have a Bloody Mary or a cocktail since it's Vegas, the wait isn't bad at all! We tried the Sausage & Egg sandwich, Bacon and Egg, Gaucho and the Egg Slut, everything was delicious! The eggs are perfect lil creations, the buns are so soft and everything just melds so well! The gaucho was so good, the tri tip, chimichurri and red onions just works so good with the egg, top notch!! BUT best of all was the egg slut... an adorable lil jar filled with the creamiest yummy potato purée, topped with a coddled egg, sea salt and chives, it comes with toasted baguette slices for dipping, heaven! I mean it! It's a pain in the ass of a wait but it's allllll worth it!"}
{"text":"Long line... They ran out of the waygu sandwich.. food is super expensive! I had the Slut and it was good but not worth $10!"}
{"text":"Eggslut has it down to a science. Had a fairfax egg sandwich and this warm gooey soft mess was soooo good. Especially good  to help that Vegas hangover. The bread makes this sandwich and the fact that they cook their eggs on low heat.

I'm not a breakfast type guy but would easily become one if I woke up to eggsluts every morning!"}
{"text":"There's really nothing NOT to love about Eggslut.  Obviously, the name is hysterical and so apropos for Vegas.  Located next to Marquee Nightclub and the Chandelier Bar in the Cosmo, Eggslut caters to a late night crowd.  I love that you can get an egg sandwich, made to order, at 3am from a reasonably priced, quick service place.  The night we went, the service was so sweet--yes, even at 2:45am! The chef in particular was in a great mood and accommodated all of our high maintenance, buzzed requests. (Extra crispy bacon, light on oil, etc) Lol 
Eggslut hit the spot and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was a longish line at around 11.30 am on a Sunday, but it was moving fairly quickly. Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan hotel is a great choice for combining breakfast and lunch. The portion is very hearty. I enjoyed the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a brioche bun, and the flavors were just so good. Bacon is applewood smoked and there is a lot of it. Egg is cooked medium so it oozes out of sandwich, can be a bit messy. Price is $8 which for this quality of breakfast sandwich was worth it. As for avoiding lines, I noticed when I was around the area in mid to late afternoon and there was no line at all, in case you want to have a hearty snack or early dinner and you are around there, great time to go."}
{"text":"eggs-ellent!!!!! loved it and will be back. had a egg cheese and bacon sandwich and fresh squeezed on. helped cure my hangover."}
{"text":"For years I've been seeing Eggslut on social media and I have always been like I need to try it. I got the chance to a couple months ago the last time I was in Vegas. Honestly it exceeded my expectations and was absolutely delicious. I got it 3 times that trip! As a lover of breakfast foods I can really appreciate the simplicity yet care that goes into their sandwiches. I got the Fairfax with no cheese, consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, carmelized onions, and their special sauce. The brioche bun is the perfect vehicle for the contents of the sandwich and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since that trip. I will be back for you one day Eggslut."}
{"text":"When in Vegas you have to get a slut and this was mine. It was quite the interesting concoction of potato purée and poached egg in a jar. After mixing the puree and egg into a yellowish mixture and spreading it onto the baguette, it was quite delicious. It's kind of like eggy grits on buttered toast."}
{"text":"People pay $10-$15 for a below average sized Breakfast sandwich?? What is the world coming too. Yes this location in my opinion is far more superior than the location in LA, but its not all that great. Its not the thee best breakfast sandwich in the world.

But did not being a fan of Eggslut because of the time I tried it in LA stop my girlfriend from cashing out here? Nope.

So we had...
*Tri Tip Sandwich(Gaucho) - $15 It was good not great. Wasn't special in anyway
*Bacon Egg & Cheese - $8 Its cool, but I can't make this at home? $3 to add sausage, I'll pass.
*SLUT - $10.50 Its a egg/potatoe cooked in a little jar... but yes this special. If this is what you are coming for, then I can see why.
*Fresh Orange Juice - $5 Cant forgot this.

Luckily I didn't wait forever and a day for this, but my review wouldn't be as pleasant if I had to wait 30 minutes or longer like some people have.(But I waited forever at Secret Pizza and yeah...) While I'm aware on average, this is the price you pay for a meal out here. They're better tasting options around."}
{"text":"Wow!
After a long night of clubbing, gambling and drinking.  We are back at it.  We decided to try this for the breakfast to recharge our bodies to watch football here at the Cosmo all day.  

We came in and were a bit nervous when we saw how busy they were.  Luckily they could handle the morning Sunday hungover drunkenness \"hangry\" crowd.  The servers were on point and the food was great. 

I got the Eggslut plate with baguettes and my buddy got the egg and bacon sandwich.  Everything was great and we really enjoyed it. 

The food, service and prices were perfect."}
{"text":"Sooo...I love egg sandwiches and when I heard about this place I was like 'wifey... we going tomorrow morning. So we went. The egg sandwiches are nice. I liked the Fairfax because the egg had chive in it and was nice a fluffy. We also split the slut... it was interesting. Service was normal fast food type Service. The seating was limited and the tables should have been cleaned more quickly. I'd give this place a 3.5.  It's novel and definitely something to try.  Wifey told me to mention that the OJ serving could be larger for the cost."}
{"text":"Juicy and refreshing Gaucho sandwich.
Not so impressed with their menu selection even though i love eggs.  I think it's a bit overrated and not worth waiting in long line especially at their original location in Grand Central Market."}
{"text":"If I could this would be a 3.5 stars review. 

I had a SLUT! An egg slut. 
The Pros: 
-I love eggs. Even more when they are runny. These people can make runny eggs. 
-Once you order your food will be ready shortly. No matter how many people you think you have in front of you. 
- They keep their few tables cleans and trash-free. 
The Cons: 
- At 9:00am or so the line had about 60 customers. Fortunately it only took 30-40 mins to get to the front. 
- Limited seating area/tables. 
- Menu is a bit finite. My husband likes ,not loves, eggs and he preferred to grab a bite somewhere else as there is not much variety. 

Tried it once and liked it but not enough to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant could go either way as vegetarian friendly, just depends on if you eat eggs or not. 
 
Entrée: Fairfax
Scrambled eggs served in a warm brioche bun. The bread was incredibly fresh and almost melted in my mouth. Definitely one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was the bun, or the dressing, or the fact that I was just so hungry! 

Side: Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie
The chocolate is made of dark chocolate, and the salt complements the taste. Worth every bite! I highly recommend getting it, and eating it later in the day. But get them early! They only bake them in the morning. 

I like that the restaurant is a \"quicker\" place in Vegas compared to other places. It's also very well priced for breakfast. I wish they had a few more items on the menu. Definitely recommend if you're in a quick bind for time!"}
{"text":"Quick simple egg sandwiches. When you absolutely need something quick and greasy, this slut is for you!"}
{"text":"Log wait for something that wasn't worth the price. Wait was 45 mins which wasn't too bad for something that was super popular. I ordered the slut tasted like mashed potatoes with a sous vide egg. Was okay but not great. Wife ordered the fair fax with avocado. It was better than mine. Maybe not a big fan of brioche bread so that was my experience. If was on a better bread I prob would have really liked it. Ordered a biscuit... ugh it was served cold and was very heavy dense. Definitely not the fluffy that was advertised. It also looked kinda grey and unappetizing"}
{"text":"The line always seems to be super long here but according to most people, the wait is not that long because it supposedly moves fast. The line always wraps around the restaurant though so when we went there around noon, we decided to eat somewhere else first because we were starving. My bf ended up coming back at midnight when they first open & there was still a line at that time but it wasn't too bad. He ordered two items to go & brought it back to our hotel room -- the slut and a bacon egg & cheese sandwich. The sandwich was whatever -- it tasted like what you would imagine it to taste like. The slut on the other hand was heavenly. It was a coddled egg in a little glass jar with mashed potatoes on the bottom. They served it with a couple pieces of bread and some hot sauce. It was really good and I even kept the jar to bring home so that I could try making it myself at home as well. Overall, I would definitely go back just for the slut but I would probably skip out on the sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of eggs and haven't been able to make it to any of the Eggsluts over in LA but gave it a try at the Cosmopolitan on a weekday. No wait at all to order but definitely a long wait for food.

My friend and I shared the Slut and Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich. They were both tasty but it didn't wow us enough to want to come back when there is a long line like others have waited. I would recommend getting the Slut though, have not come across another restaurant that serves a dish like this.

Tip: You order at the cashier and they'll give you your receipt with a number on it that you'll use to claim your food later. You seat yourself and clear away your dishes on your own once you're done."}
{"text":"GAUCHO
seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun

Walked in on a Friday 11 am and this place had an unbelievable line! As a result, I went to Momofuku because I was so hungry. Later that very late evening (4am Saturday to be exact). My friend and I ordered the GAUCHO. The cage free egg was definitely cooked to perfection.  As for the tri-tip, I could hardly tell if it was wagyu or roast beef. At about $15 a sandwich I was quite disappointed. You might as well feed me an Arby's roast beef topped with a cage-free egg!!!!

As the customers started building up, I noticed many ordered the SLUT. I was told that this dish was good even it seemed weird to me. I personally don't like eating my yolk, unless it is combined with at least meat and rice (or bread in this case). However, I am willing to give it a try since I'm open to new things.

SLUT

{"text":"Fantastic! Stayed in the Cosmo and was looking for breakfast. I had the bacon and egg sandwich which was fabulous. I normally don't like my yolk runny and didn't know that's how it came but once I tried my taste buds loved it!!! If you go this is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Boy they look good! The eggs taste so good but thats about it. Everything else taste okay. I feel like i could make it at home. Also, coffee costs $5. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food is good, I really like the slut. But the wait is long and it is not a very relaxing place to sit down and enjoy my breakfast!. But worth a try."}
{"text":"I had to give Eggslut at Cosmo a try to see how it compared to the LA original.  Having just had breakfast, I just got the Slut since I remember liking it so much.

I remember thinking $9 for a Slut was a lot, so $10.50 was almost torture to pay.  But hey, this is Vegas, where money has no value.  So what the heck, I went for it.

I'm not sure if it was because I just had breakfast or if it was the sticker shock, but it was not as good as I remembered it being.  The potato puree at the bottom was really thick and not nearly the creamy texture I remember it.  The egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk having a texture between runny and hard.  I wish it came with more than three pieces of bread, but this is a problem I had with it in LA as well, so I knew what I was going to get here.  I have a feeling most people who visit Eggslut for the first time don't know about the Slut, so they don't sell very many per hour.  Because of this, the Sluts sit in the water bath for too long and the potato puree loses its nice texture.

Overall, it felt like I should have saved my $11 or put it on a roll of the roulette wheel.

For those with an immersion circulator and want to replicate their egg, their water bath is plainly visible and the temp is 142F."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience in itself here at the Eggslut. Food was good but heavy. Menu was unique in this fun environment. Eggslut was super well made and filling. You have to try it."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try Eggslut in L.A. but had never gotten around to it. During a weekend in Vegas I stumbled upon the location inside the Cosmopolitan and decided that this was my chance. We stopped by before heading back home to Southern California. By the time we arrived (around 11am) the line was very long. I questioned waiting but decided it was now or never. So glad we waited. One bite and it's easy to understand that it's more than just hype. The line moves quickly so I highly recommend giving it a try. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The line looked like it would take 30 minutes before I'd be able to place my order, but I ended up having food in hand in 21 minutes, which is reasonable. The biscuit was spectacular, but the egg, bacon and cheese sandwich was just ok. If there were no lines and I needed a quick bite in a hurry - I'd go back, otherwise I'll never return. So basically, I'll never return. The food isn't worth the wait... any wait."}
{"text":"2 stars only cause I was hungry... Ordered a plain burger meat and cheese only... They gave me a burger with pickles and mayo slipped on... Either they don't care or they are legally dumb.. I recommend eating somewhere else if you got the munchies"}
{"text":"Ate here  after a night of partying til almost 5:00am. We didn't wait in line cause obviously who is in line at that hour lol. The next day the line was super long. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. It was very good!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the hype.

I had the fairfax sandwich with bacon. It seemed like the perfect idea. The girl behind the counter seemed delighted I want to order that item. Turns out I was delighted to eat it as well. The scrambled eggs were rich and delicious with fresh chives. The bacon was cooked beautifully. The brioche really seals the deal on excellence. Overall it's a completely delicious sandwich in every way.

Only downside (not the food): 11:30AM on a Friday and the line was something like 30 people deep. So we had to wait a few minutes to order. This isn't a deal breaker but it also isn't my favorite thing. I guess it's the nature of eating in trendy spots."}
{"text":"Long lines, great sandwiches. We waited about 45 minutes at 10am on a Saturday and ordered a bunch of different sandwiches.

The eggslut which is a soft boiled egg on top of pureed potatoes is delicious! The potatoes are really good and with the runny yolk it's a great combo.

Their actual sandwiches are made on fresh bread and the egg itself is perfectly cooked! The one with bacon (they give you a lot of bacon) is pretty good, and their hamburger is just OK."}
{"text":"Once the plane touches the ground we are going to get slutty at Egg Slut!

Long lines, few tables, no napkins in the napkin dispenser.. Oh well.. Great customer service and amazing food that just orgasm in your mouth made up for it!

We ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich! So good!! Very flavorful I must say and the sausage I got was huge! I mean HUGE!! 

We also got the slut!! Thick purée potatoes with a runny warm egg yolk on top of slices of baguettes. Omg!! I'm just sad there were only 3 baguettes! Maybe I'm just being greedy!

They don't have regular tap water. You have to buy the bottled water which was $4.50. I thought it was a ripoff! 

I would definitely come back for their food!!"}
{"text":"Was wondering what all the hype was about and wanted to try it. It's pretty average. Tasty due to the amount of greasy stuff they put into it. I had the fair fax with avocado. It was a good rich taste. Think I'll have to try something else next time. 30 minute wait for me around 3pm. The lines were relatively short at this time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for the weekend and decided to get a late breakfast, we saw that there was an Eggslut at the Cosmopolitan. We got there around 2pm and the line was pretty long, but it did move fast. I ordered the Fairfax and my boyfriend ordered the Gaucho, and we both got an orange juice. We ended up paying about $40 for those items and although it is a bit pricey, we both loved our food. The eggs were so soft it almost felt like they melted in my mouth. My boyfriend also really loved the Gaucho. He said the steak was delicious and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was a good experience, and if you're looking for really good breakfast food I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"For the type of place they are and the food they serve they are at the top. 

I came I at what I would call an off hour, there was no line. There were only two other customers in the facility. Very pleasant. 

I decided to try the egg slut, even though I was very apprehensive at first. At first sight I thought they were kidding me after I sat down. It was delicious I had only one disappointment they didn't have Tabasco sauce. I do like almost every thing spicy. 

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Plan ahead, get there early enough because there's been a line the two times we've gone in the AM. Also, we tried to go by there at around 3pm in the afternoon on a Friday and they were all sold out of the Eggslut. About the Eggslut itself, we enjoyed it because we love mashed potatoes and runny eggs. You mix it up in the jar with the chives, and spread it on the toasted baguette slices, and it's a good breakfast to start your day. We also tried the Egg and Bacon sandwich, if you LOVE bacon and don't mind the pile of saltiness, then go for it. For some, there can be such a thing as too much bacon. We also tried the egg and sausage sandwich on our second trip, and that was more to my tasting -- but to each their own. There is limited seating, but I think the timing is just right between folks waiting for their order, and those rotating out when done eating. There's also the couches nearby (I think a part of the Chandelier lounge/bar?)."}
{"text":"The egg sandwich is more than just a glorified McMuffin.  It's really good and worth the 15 minute wait from around the corner.  The size of the egg sandwich is substantial for the  8.50usd price.  The egg is cooked to perfection.

I'd definitely make an effort to go when I'm in NYC or LA."}
{"text":"Decent but overrated when they're packed... which is always. Get the scrambled egg options, as the medium egg is WAY too thin and small."}
{"text":"Okay so this place is all the rage right now. A line that wraps around the corner. It roughly takes you about an hour from line to get the food into your hands. My take on eggslut, is this establishment is just that, a stinking hoe out to take you for your money and not give you much in return. Sandwiches are small, they cost about $8 each, without much inside. The slut is $10, again so small! You need to spend about $20 to be full. As a vegetarian I was depressed, asked for no bacon, to find a fried egg over cheese, it was pathetic.  The slut on the other hand is tasty, just small. Try it out for yourself, make sure you order enough so you don't have to get back in line."}
{"text":"The food is pricey for what it is yes, BUT worth the indulgence! They have a simple menu, offer items with delicious flavor combinations, and use all quality ingredients. The bread is worth the carbs, but you can ask them to make whatever you want breadless. The staff are all super nice. The line is typically long, but it moves pretty fast. I ordered the GAUCHO multiple times I liked it so much."}
{"text":"It was okay. The staff were friendly, and the food was solid, but I don't know that it was worth the wait in line. If I had to do over again, I'd probably skip it, but again, it was solid food."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! Go early--there was a line at 730am but it's so worth it! I had the mason jar egg over mashed taters. Delicious delicious delicious. Make a stop when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast and we were not disappointed. This really made my Vegas experience great. 

This place is located on the second floor of the cosmo. Next to the Chinese restaurant. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich and it was delicious! The scrambled egg literally melted in mouth. After I finished my sandwich I was so sad because I wanted more. I was about to go stand back in line just to order another one but by the time I finished my sandwich the line was super long. I also got an orange juice and it was really good since its fresh squeezed. 

The service was great. Every one was so friendly and nice. The only downside about this place is that if you come late the line gets really long. But it is definitely worth it so you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Eggslut was great where in Las Vegas staying at the Cosmopolitan and had a chance to eat there two days in a row two sandwiches were wonderful"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I came for a lunch break at 6 and was in and out! I ordered the Fairfax and added turkey sausage. The orange juice is AMAZING and tastes like your biting into an orange, so fresh! Also, they only have one cookie option. I ordered their chocolate chip and requested it to be warmed and the sea salt adds a great touch! Highly recommend for more than just a breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect addition to the Cosmopolitan hotel. Its a pricy breakfast joint but is worth giving it a try. 

Gaucho : Seared Wagyu tri tip steak with over med egg, with chimmichurri sauce on a warm broche bun. Flavorful packed in one sandwich I would order this if you are REALLY hungry. The steak and egg was cooked to perfection. 

Fairfax: scrambled eggs with cheese, onion served in a warm brioche bun. YUM!  

My fav item: the SLUT which is potato puree and poached egg on top. You mix it lightly in the jar by doing counter clock wise turns slowly. I prefer thick chunks so I only turn it about 5-6 times max otherwise it gets too soft and does not have the bite to it."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The original is located back home in LA at the Grand Central Market and is known to have horrendous lines, which is why I've never bothered going. Since we were at the Cosmo (we'd just finish eating over at Secret Pizza), we decided to stop by.

I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheese for the 5 of us to share since we were so full. We all took 2+ bites, so it was a pretty large sandwich. It came out looking picture perfect for Instagram, so I was already skeptical of it's taste. Food that looks that good rarely tastes just as good. I was semi-correct. Although it was tasty, it was heavy and I'm not sure it was worth $8. You could get two Sausage McMuffins for less and feel just as satisfied.

Don't get me wrong -- it was good, but I don't think it's worth the wait at all. I mean, beezies at home are waiting an hour for a sandwich from here. Unless you're in the mood for breakfast, go to Secret Pizza."}
{"text":"This place gets CROWDED, even in the middle of the week. With that, I do have to say, ease up peeps. I know you've had a long night out and you probably got minimal to no sleep, but you don't need to take it out on the staff. They're just here to serve you delicious eggs to help relieve that hangover you're probably carrying with ya.

Jaime and I were excited to hear that this popular LA eatery was now a new dining spot in our hotel. I've always wanted to try the one in DTLA, but I could never bring myself to wait in line, especially when it's warm. The lines here are long as well, but at least you're in a climate controlled, air conditioned environment - so it's not terrible.

We got into line around 930AM and it was already wrapped down the hallway. After checking out the menu, we decided on a breakfast sandwich with sausage and one with bacon. Everything moved super quick, and then you're there to wait. Get comfy, cause it can be a while and this is where I saw the most of the crankiness ensue. Since everything is made to order, food comes out on the slower side. They have a ton of people working in the kitchen, but most of the time, customers are ordering multiple items at the same time causing a little bit of a speed bump. The guy handing out orders was a champ though, even when people were shoving receipts in his face demanding their food. Keep up the good fight!

It was probably about 20-mins before we got our stuff, but we enjoyed doing some people watching while we waited. There are all types that come through here... it's fun trying to figure out where they were or where they're going.

For food, we both really enjoyed our sandwiches. They were served on fluffy brioche buns and had a good amount of eggs, meat and condiments to make it a great handheld. Consuming one was good, especially since wanted to eat again in a few hours. Make sure to grab napkins, cause they do get messy.

I'd for sure come back. The prices weren't super steep and I thought they were pretty tasty. If you want to cut down on the lines, I'd go around 1-2pm as it seemed much slower when we walked by."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. I got the Gaucho sandwich and my wife got the fair fax add bacon and avocado. We both were very satisfied"}
{"text":"There was no love put into this. Maybe bc it was 1am when we got it. But the Venice location goes hard in the paint."}
{"text":"For what it is, Eggslut doesn't hold back as a great breakfast / brunch option on the Strip.  If you love eggs like me, this is definitely your domain.

I had to try their namesake entree, The Slut.  Just with a name like that, it's just demanding to be ordered!  So I ordered that and also had The Gaucho since many of my yelp buddies have had it and praised it.

The Slut -- http://bit.ly/2inO9e0
A coddled egg on top of smooth potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette
It's like a glorified mashed potato.  I love that it's served piping hot.  To eat it, you have to breakdown the egg and fold it into the potato puree.  It's a playful entree and delicious as well!

The Gaucho -- http://bit.ly/2inOcqc
Seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg in a warm brioche bun
The Gaucho is a great breakfast sandwich, probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a generous amount of beef and the runny egg made it all heavenly..  Unfortunately I couldn't get a decent pic of the egg since it had already broken down and ran all over the sandwich by the time I brought it to my counter.  Still an awesome egg sandwich!

The weekend hours are what make this place desirable especially for the late night clubbing crowd.  12am to 7pm.  I've only been here in the middle of the week in the morning and it was pretty busy, so I can only imagine how insanely long the line can be on the weekends.

Overall, Eggslut is a great dining addition to the Cosmopolitan and the Strip in general.  You can pretty much go here at any time of the day to get your egg fix in an elevated form."}
{"text":"Coming to Vegas I had heard a lot of things regarding Eggslut.

We came out of the Marque day club around 4 in the afternoon on a Saturday. The line was about 20 minutes long for starters, the cashier rushing myself and the group we went with to order. 

Overlooking the menu, their item choice was sub par for what is supposed to be a culinary ride in Las Vegas. The seating was crowded, the tables taking most of the small space as we sat after ordering. A slut for me, as the restaurants specialty item, and a 15 minute wait. 

The food was disappointing when coming out, three stale biscuits with a small preservative jar and filled with an overheated poached egg on a small cardboard tray. The meal was messy, not filling or appetizing, and honestly underwhelming for the huge hype that followed. 

For $10 I would not suggest it and would avoid Eggslut entirely for service."}
{"text":"The best way to start your day and end a great vacation!! The Fairfax is the best I've ever had!! I can't wait to come back and try another."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I honestly feel about eggsslut. I came here with high expectations and intentions of ordering their egg sandwich but as I kept looking at the menu, I decided to order the wagyu sandwich. I'm a bit disappointed that I did change my order. The wait to order was LONG... if you're determined to try eggsslut, and the wait doesn't bother you then go for it. 

I wasn't too impressed with the sandwich and the biscuit was very disappointing. I assumed that they bake fresh biscuits, but I saw they had them sitting out and popped it back in the oven to re heat it..... I ate half of it and threw it away. As for the sandwich, it was a bit plain.. I needed some tripe of condiment to add some type of flavor. Nevertheless, I still finished the sandwich. I ended up paying about $20 for both the two items.  My friend ordered a burger and she was not impressed, and didn't bother finishing it. 

I would only come back to actually try their egg sand which."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a Las Vegas regular and it was Fantastic! Great price for a delicious and flavorful breakfast sandwich in a fancy hotel and casino. 

I got the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and the chipotle ketchup gave it that extra kick that separates it from your everyday breakfast sandwich. 

If you can get over the ridiculously long line (waited almost 40 minutes to order and another 10-15mins for my order) it's worth it.  Not a lot of seating because it more of a carry-out style place and the line is in the hallway next to the ordering counter and was rather hot for some reason, making it a less than an enjoyable wait. 

I only gave it 4 starts because of the wait time but it is extremely popular so to be expected. Can't wait to return to Eggslut my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was shocked how a 30min line around the corner delivered such a blah bfast.  I know choices are limited in some hotels so you have to take what you can get, but the huge crowd, hype, and wait for an egg and bacon sandwich made hastily and flavorless made this a 1-and-done experience."}
{"text":"Great concept, but waited way too long for an overpriced pretty delicious egg sandwich. We hit it at one of its busiest times, Sunday morning around 10am. The line was long but was moving fast so we decided to wait. The line itself only took 10 mins to put our order in, but took an hour to actually get our sandwiches. We ordered the Farifax one with bacon and one with sausage (the bacon was better). Their whole process seemed very well done at first, but since we were standing their for an hour we really got to see a lot. I would say they need a better way to actually get the sandwiches out to the customers. Meaning your order should have a number not a name. People with the same name were getting confused. All together a number would be nice to give you an idea of how much longer till you get your own order. I would say to some it all up, if it's not too busy than try it it really is a tasty sandwich, but If it's slammed better to keep walking."}
{"text":"Overpriced egg with mashed potatoes underneath. I dont see what the hype is all about. Not worth the $10"}
{"text":"If you even remotely like eggs and delicious food, this is the place for breakfast in Vegas. Quick service, friendly staff, chill environment."}
{"text":"No question, the best egg sandwich I have ever had. I got the sausage and egg sandwich, and it was totally worth the wait. There is apparently always a line, but it moves fairly quick and our food was ready within 10 min of ordering. The egg is prepared over easy and can get a little messy, but don't let that sway you. Someone ordered a sandwich with scrambled eggs. Big mistake. Let them prepare the sandwich how they intended.

The only reason for the 1 star deduct is the price. As others have mentioned, it's a rather pricey option, especially for breakfast counter orders. But this is a place I still highly recommend and would most likely re-visit next time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is popular. I looked at the line up the first time, and then I walked away, saying NO WAY! A couple of minutes later, I came back, when the line was even longer and got myself into the back of it.

Lots of nice people in line, taking pictures, chit-chatting, doing their thing, which helps the time go by a bit faster. Problem is, I'm giving them 5 stars just like a 1000 other people have done before me, and that's not going to make their line up any shorter. It isn't going to give them any incentive to try to change things either, cos their business is thriving.

I hope they will find a way to serve people faster. The food was good. I thoroughly enjoyed my bacon, egg, and cheese with an Orange Juice. It was good fresh squeezed juice. Just writing this has made me want some fresh squeezed juice."}
{"text":"At first I thought that \"man this line is too long,\" but thankfully I decided to stay in the line. It moved pretty quickly and a few short minutes later I had ordered my fresh biscuit, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and a cold brew. This was an awesome breakfast experience. The food was fresh and very tasty! I'd highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Eggslut and finally had the opportunity to try it,. I got the Fairfax sandwich, blown away by their fluffy soft scramble, served between a warm, toasted brioche bun with spicy sriracha. Give me 2! 

If you're like me and you love an old fashion chocolate chip cookie, definitely try their's! Crisp outer edge,  soft center, huge chunks of chocolate chips topped with gray salt. Sounds weird, but the gray salt really compliments the chocolate.

The branding here of unique, whoever branded this joint clearly has a great sense of humor. Their tip jar says, \"sluts need love too\" and by their trash can, it says, \"we recycle our sluts.\" Haha! 

Definitely worth trying though it is a tad pricey for something so simple!"}
{"text":"Yes you need to eat the slut! No that is not a type-o the slut was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. We also had the steak sandwich, and it assisted in curing our hangovers. Good job egg slut!"}
{"text":"It was delicious.....but was it cuz I was craving for something savory? Or because i didn't want to hit the buffet nor pay $12 for cold pressed juice or pass on the Milk compost cookie?  Not sure if I want to stand in line again for 25 mins from start to finish.  

Well, for a hotel like this....(Cosmo) it's hard to find a $8.50 breakfast sandwich that is actually made-to-order!!!! So ultimately, if you have the time, why not? 

If you like bacon, they are generous! The egg yolk literally dripped all over my hand....it was a truly sunny side up!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Seriously, where can I get one in the Bay Area? 

First thing to know about Eggslut is that you need to time your visit. If you try to visit during the breakfast/brunch hours, be prepared to wait 30 minutes or possibly even more for the line and your food. Try to come past the lunch hours (approximately after 1pm) if you're impatient like me.

As for the food itself, I got the Slut which is a potato mash beneath a poached egg and it comes with pieces of bread to scoop up the mash and egg. It's by far my favorite way to eat poached egg now. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The only small complaint is that it's not an very filling meal if you're starving. I definitely wasn't hungry after I ate it but I wasn't really full either.

I had a bite of my friends burger and it was quite tasty as well and apparently more filling so that's probably the way to go if you're looking to cure your hangover."}
{"text":"Wow... who could've thought something so simple could be so good. The concept - everything involves eggs in some form or another. Came to the LV location inside the Cosmo hotel for breakfast. Got in line around 945AM and it was already wrapped around but we noticed it moved quickly. After about 15-20 min we ordered. Gaucho sounded great so that's what I ordered. The egg was cooked perfectly and the beef inside the sandwich was well marinated. You could actually taste the salt/pepper and other spices on the beef. The bread was something I had never tasted before but sort of a croissant/bagel as it was fluffy like a croissant but not greasy. 

Service was good food was amazing... only 1 problem, there's no location in/around/near Washington DC"}
{"text":"I heard about this place so  I walked 2 miles to try the egg salad.....delicious! Fast and friendly service!  I will return to try the slut next time!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  Few seating available inside the restaurant.  Outside seating available nearby.  Line formed during early breakfast/brunch but moved quickly.  Menu is limited and straightforward.  Bacon was soggy despite request for crispy. The egg salad was seasoned just right."}
{"text":"Eggslut is a great name. Totally caught my attention cause hello, it's a dirty name lol and I love eggs. My fiancé and I got the Fairfax sandwich when we ate here. It's really good and the brioche bun is so soft and fluffy. You can really taste the caramelized onions. I'd give them 5 stars but the sandwiches felt really light on the eggs. Ironic cause they're called Eggslut. Next time I would ask if they could add an extra egg to the scramble, so that it's more hearty and so you can really taste some eggs."}
{"text":"I LOVE my breakfast food, so I was extremely excited when I heard that I was going to get some grub at Eggslut! Located inside the beautiful hotel of Cosmopolitan, Eggslut is there for your breakfast needs.

Of course, there was a line in the morning at 9AM but it went rather quickly. I wish the area was a little bigger, as the line was pretty long. On my visit, I waited about 15 minutes in line which wasn't that bad.

I went for the classic bacon egg and cheese and was not disappointed! 

Trendy little spot inside a nice casino!!"}
{"text":"We waited for the few available spaces.  Maybe I would have given a 4 star if the line was not so long, I can't be sure because the wait did effect my attitude.  The egg dishes were fine. The signature Egg Slut is a little as it comes in a jar.  The eggs were fine, but I don't see this place so different that I would wait that long again."}
{"text":"Delicious eggslut sandwich on the second floor of cosmo hotel, and super affordable/reasonable price for Vegas standards! 
The line gets pretty ridiculous throughout the day. Best time is probably right before they close, there was only 2-3 ppl in line when I went at that time."}
{"text":"Overrated. Had a Sausage Egg Sandwich.  Didn't have any taste and no kick in the sandwich. Careful when eating because the egg is runny. My friend ruined her shirt because the egg yolk just sprayed on her from the egg.  Very disappointed with the taste. Sandwiches are pretty to look at but not worth the hype."}
{"text":"LONG line, but I will say worth the wait. Wish there was more egg on the sandwich, seemed like a ton of bread with little egg. However, it was VERY good. Bacon was good as well. Egg was perfectly made and packaged. It's fun to watch them make it all in front of you. The line does move fairly quickly as well."}
{"text":"After waiting an hour in a half for my order every second of that was well worth it. Although we have an Egg slut here in LA I've never really had the chance to try it. This was the best breakfast I've had in Vegas. You will definitely be full for the entire day. My boyfriend had the egg, bacon with cheese sandwich and I had the bacon sausage cheese and egg sandwich. I will for sure go to the LA location."}
{"text":"THE BEST THING I ATE IN LAS VEGAS!
(and it was a breakfast sandwich, see pic)
- that fresh baked brioche is waxy yet buttery soft inside
- their scrambled eggs are so moist they're almost runny
- the carmelized onions meld into the gooey cheddar
- I added a patty of their spicy unami turkey sausage
- and all were coated in a warm sriracha chive mayo;
(my first bite was truly an OMG that is amazing moment)!

SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS A 50+ PERSON LINE!
and it does not move quickly. But as the well-traveled lady on my flight remarked: \"I never go to Las Vegas without 2 or 3 meals at Eggslut\". I actually made my second visit an off-hours lunch (just a 20 person line). 

A HUGE FAIRFAX WITH SAUSAGE & COFFEE = $13
n.b. New Orleans entrepreneurs: we need a franchise!"}
{"text":"I love sluts! There, I said it. I am in love with the slut. This is my second trip to Eggslut (first time was in LA). The first time I had the Fairfax and added bacon and avocado. It was phenomenal. So many flavors bursting in your mouth and dripping out the bag. Yeah that was tasty. So I ordered the same thing, but without bacon this time. My fiance decided to try the slut and share my Fairfax. I had one taste of his slut and couldn't stop eating. I was missing out! The pureed potatoes mixed with the coddled egg and swirled with the chives. So freaking delicious!! Now, if only they would open a location in Denver, I would go there every week at least. My suggestion, try the slut. It tasted so much better than I anticipated."}
{"text":"I'm foodie whore! I saw EggSlut on the Food Network several months back and I said to myself when I'm back in LA or Vegas I'm gonna try this place outside.

You know what? It didn't disappoint. 

The Slut -it tastes like one- is a sous vide preparation of mash potatoes topped with poached eggs and sea salt. Expensive for the little size that it is. But delicious.

I also had the steak and sunny side up egg sandwich with chimichurri. Runny, unctuous and savoury all wrapped -or should I say sandwiches- into one.

Worth the trip to the Cosmopolitan to try it out."}
{"text":"The hype for Eggslut is well well deserved. I will admit that I used to get super annoyed when I would see my IG feed filled with these random ass egg sandwiches and even more annoyed when people would talk about their hour plus waits. Eggslut lovers I was wrong wrong wrong! Yes it's worth the hours wait, yes their eggs and sandwiches live up to the hype, yes to all. 

Being in Vegas, you can always expect crowds everywhere and anywhere no matter which weekend you go - this was especially true on the weekend I went which was that of the Billboard Music Awards. Regardless we knew we were going to have to wait to eat, so why not try Eggslut - just to say that we have. 

Be forewarned, Eggslut is a tiny establishment. They have very limited seating and even the area to stand in line is quite random - flowing down a dark hallway toward the bathrooms. But again, they serve egg sandwiches so people generally don't take too long to finish their meals and free up seats. 

Over the course of two days, I went back three times. No shame, the cashier remembered my name, I'm a bit proud of that. The first time we went was around 11 on Saturday morning and it was quite busy. We waited about 45 minutes in total. When it's crowded, you will be standing in two lines, the first to place your order and the second to pick up your food. 

The second two times however, we went after visiting Wicked Spoon at about 2 on a Sunday (no shame here either) and there was absolutely no line. Wait or none, it's worth it. 

Everything on their menu (if you couldn't figure out by the name) is centered around eggs. There are various types of sandwiches to choose from but the gist of it - some sort of protein (sausage, turkey sausage or bacon), eggs (over medium or scrambled) with the option of cheese or avocado add on a soft brioche bun. 

I was super bummed during my first visit that their special the slut was unavailable so I went with the classic egg sausage and cheese sandwich. Again - I was not expecting much when my order arrived - it looked like a plain ol egg sandwich. I was wrong. The egg was perfectly cooked, with the yolk still running when I bit into the sandwich. The sausage was savory and perfectly seasoned and the brioche was soft. It's sad but I was astounded by how real the food tasted, no fillers no rubberiness.  

My second and third visit here they had sluts available and my stomach still smiles when I think about this. The slut is their signature egg dish served in a glass jar. A coddled egg atop the creamiest mashed potatoes you will ever taste with a touch of chives and perfect amount of salt atop. 

I can't even begin to explain how freaking amazing it is spread atop of the buttered baguette. The creamy egg and creamy mashed potatoes are delicately flavored with the yolk and salt. Everything just melts in your mouth. 

It was pretty cool watching the chefs prepare all of the sandwiches since they have an open kitchen/bar design. You get a front row seat watching them crack and whisk eggs, fry up the bacon and sausages and assemble everything. Guys, they're using real food here and it's sad that it's a big deal when restaurants use real ingredients but that's another story. 

On my third visit we had the privilege to chat with the chef and he gave us the 411 on Eggslut. We were super curious about how many eggs they actually go through a day and he said he orders anywhere between 1500 and 1800 a day from a farm in California!! As we gushed about how much we loved the slut he explained how it was made, the mashed potatoes at the bottom are actually the exact recipe as the mashed potatoes at Robuchon. And it is topped with a coddled egg - what is a coddled egg? Well it's quite similar to a poached egg but it never comes into contact with any water, it's cracked on top the potatoes and essentially boiled at a controlled temperature for an hour. 

A few things to note:
- You want to cut down on carbs, you can substitute the bread for a salad.
- If you order the slut to go you get to keep the glass jar!"}
{"text":"Eggslut...you had me eating every last crumb! This is located inside the Cosmopolitan. We came here for breakfast and waited in a pretty long line. They have the menu in a couple spots so you can already start drooling over what you want. My husband has had Eggslut before, but for me this was a first. 

I ordered the Bacon, egg, and cheese. It was literally the best breakfast sandwich I have had. Whatever sauce they used is what made the sandwich. The bacon was crisp and the bun was fluffy yet firm. My husband ordered the Gaucho sandwich which he says they don't have over where we live. He loved it as well and said it beats out all the other stuff he has tried.

They were quick with orders and also serve beer! Which is a good tip since your in Vegas and I am sure you might want one in the morning. The water is also a little cheaper than the surrounding vendors."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but when we went, there was a HUGE line.  We thought about it and decided it must be good enough for people to want to wait.  I will say - it was good!  But I wouldn't wait like that again - I'd probably go back at an 'off time'."}
{"text":"Delicious! LA is home to Eggslut and Eggslut is HUGE there so I am glad I was able to finally try it while I was in Vegas. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches and Eggslut basically has your slightly more glamorized version of your typical breakfast sandwiches. The line is usually long and there are only a few seats in the actual restaurant so we had to find some seats around the Cosmopolitan. There are only a few items on the menu but they do what they do well. I ordered the gaucho which is a $15 breakfast sandwich with wagyu beef. I opted to add turkey sausage for an extra $3. If I'm paying #18 for a sandwich it better be the best sandwich in the world. The egg was cooked perfectly. The wagyu beef was so juicy and tender. The arugula and chimichurri added a different texture and a nice contrast of taste. The flavors blended together really well. I love that they use a brioche bun for all their sandwiches - it definitely ups their game. If you don't want the bun, you can opt for a salad...but let's be real - who wants to eat salad for breakfast?"}
{"text":"5 stars doesn't even give this place justice. My fiance and I came here every single day when we stayed in Vegas. We saw eggslut on some TV show and we had to give them a try. I can't even begin to describe how amazing their sandwiches are. Totally worth paying 9 bucks for a breakfast sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Decided To Grab A Quick Breakfast.

This Restaurant Was Walking Distance From Where I Was Staying.

The Lines Are Pretty Long. 

The Cheeseburger Could Of Used More Flavor.

I Also Think They Use Frozen Patties. 

I'm Not Much Of A Fan. 

Wouldn't Patronize Again.

On To The Next."}
{"text":"I had an amazing egg sandwich (the fairfax: eggs, chives, cheese, sriracha aioli on a brioche bun) here on my trip to Vegas. The service was kind of slow, but you can watch them prepare each order and they obviously take great care to make sure each sandwich is perfect. The staff was friendly as well.

I would highly recommend this spot (2nd floor or the Cosmo by the Chandelier Bar) for a late night snack or breakfast. Note: whatever you do, don't unwrap your sandwich! These babies are stuffed so full that everything will fall out if you do!"}
{"text":"As everything seemed to be in Vegas, I found Eggslut to be overpriced and overhyped.

I waited on a pretty long line and ordered the slut. While it was an interesting concept and pretty delicious, I'm not sure it was worth the wait and price.

Bottom line - it was tasty but not enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"It was a long line and it's not cheap ($20 for an egg sandwich and coffee), but it's Vegas, the line moves quickly and the food is worth the wait. I had the Fairfax with bacon, and I'll be coming back to have the Slut and the Burger. Really, really good."}
{"text":"35 minute wait in line to find out that they were out of the Slut.  I wish someone would have come out to let the line know. We would have gone elsewhere as we were anxious to hit the road. Our backups were perfectly fine but not worth an additional 25 minute wait after ordering. Despite the wait the food is mostly right. Brioche is spectacular, eggs a bit inconsistent (mine too hard, his just right) bacon nice and thiiiick, and fresh OJ paired with their arugula salad for under $40 seems like a steal for the Strip.....if you can handle the wait. Sunday is Sunday but they can use an extra hand cleaning up their seating areas and counter.  Filthy AF."}
{"text":"3.2 Stars
Located in Cosmopolitan across from Marquee night club.

First impressions,  well lit stand alone food court style stand.  Not a big seating area, more of a take out joint.

Service was good, however my order took longer to come out because the guy that serves the order also had to clear the tables.

I ordered: 
The Fairfax - had good heat to it with the sriracha mayo, love the brioche bun.

I have heard from a number of people that this place is so good, a must have. In my opinion, this place is overrated. Yes, it's a good breakfast sandwich, but that is what it is, a breakfast sandwich.  For that price your taste buds should be blown away.

Overall Experience:
Service - 7.2/10
Cleanliness - 6.5/10
Food - 7.5/10
Value - 5.5/10
Parking - N/A"}
{"text":"Very efficient operation working quickly even with a long line. Only issue was we ordered without the sauce and both sandwiches came coated with sauce on both sides. Very gracious about quickly preparing new ones. Limited seating so might want to get to go. Go next door to MILK to get your drink. Many more choices and cheaper"}
{"text":"The name drew me in but the food definitely made me stay. This is a place I will definitely hit up again when I'm in town. It is a little on the expensive side but well worth it."}
{"text":"I am not usually one who buys into the idea that if \"everyone\" likes something I will to. I also have never been one of those people that has to check things off my list just so I can tell everyone I did it. That's probably why it took me at least 5 trips to Vegas to finally make a point of going here and the only reason I did, is because I LOVE EGGS!! I had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Now I get it, this is Vegas, on the strip, and in the beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, but come on people. This is nothing special. In fact, I am almost certain I can make a better breakfast sandwich than this one. In fact, I just did this morning. Not only was it less expensive, but I made it quicker also. I really have it down to a science. So, let's just say I will not be going here again, I will continue to enjoy my own sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. The Fiance loved them so much he went back multiple times on our trip!"}
{"text":"Get the egg slut. This place needs to stay open late.  I would eat here three times a day if I could."}
{"text":"So, let's get it out of the way - the slut (potato puree poached egg) might be one of the best things I've ever had, anywhere. Don't tell my gym trainer, but I've had two at once on occasion.

Sandwich-wise, I usually go straight for the egg salad - just delectable. When I'm in a more carnivorous mood, the gaucho with its seared tri-tip is fantastic. Otherwise, the straightforward sausage egg and cheese gets the job done.

To avoid the lines, try in the early afternoon. It also opens at midnight on weekend nights (Fri night, Sat night) and is usually not crowded until the drunk eaters come out of Marquee.

When I'm at eggslut, it's a little alarming how much I can spend on breakfast food. When I'm not at eggslut, I'm glad it's expensive because it keeps me away from negating my gym sessions."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best breakfast places I have EVER been too!
The quality of all ingredients, were delicious and fresh! The service is quick, and the restaurant is really clean for how busy it is. Don't stress if you see a lot of people in line, you won't be waiting long!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fairfax, and it was hands down the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my life! It is very flavorful. I crave it all the time now but too bad they don't have an Egg Slut in my city."}
{"text":"Over hyped breakfast sandwiches. I can slap on a sunny side up egg between toasts and it'll still taste better. Should lower the price for okay food or make it taste better."}
{"text":"Waited in this long line up for the slut and let me tell you it was worth it. By far the best egg experience I had."}
{"text":"The hype is real. This is how fast food should be. You can see the cooks actually cooking real eggs, in pans, in pots, in a sous vide. Real eggs! You can see the cooks actually cracking open eggs to make over easy eggs. The bacon is not sad slivers of dry pre-cooked packaged bacon! It is raw slabs slapped on the griddle to brown. 

The brioche bun is warm and soft as you bite into it. I got the Fairfax with turkey sausage and had to wait awhile because they had just used the last big pot of scrambled eggs and had to make a fresh batch. Yes! Fresh scrambled eggs not premade and not being poured from a prepared carton! 

The result! A delicious egg bun treat served up fresh and warm! 

Orange juice is the real deal too. I could taste the bitter from the peel, so I'm guessing they press the whole orange. Yummy! 

Now I understand the lines. And there are always lines. The line does move. I was lucky and went when the one was just halfway down the hall. Best time to go is around 3:40pm before closing for no line. But it's worth a 20 min wait. I don't know about longer. That crazy is up to you."}
{"text":"The best place for real heavy breakfast, banana nut bread is moist and yummy. The place gets crowded expect at least 10-15 min wait, so reach early to this place."}
{"text":"Fairfax with bacon and avocado was bomb! The fresh squeezed OJ was amazing too. Worth the wait for sure. The line moves quickly as well."}
{"text":"Oh wow.. I got the bacon egg and cheese ! The sauce makes the entire sandwich. Don't let the line fool you , it moves super fast! Wish we had one out in CA. Dying for one again! Super yummy"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot located on 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel and casino. Concept and menu is pretty simple. They offer a few breakfast sandwiches either on bread or greens. Everything is fresh and tasty. Price is pretty reasonable as well. They were out of cold brew coffee which is the only complaint I had."}
{"text":"So I had heard great reviews of this place and we were staying at Caesars so we decided to walk over for breakfast.  It's a very popular place because the line was very long.  Took about 30 minutes to get to the front to order, then another 20-25 to wait for our food.  I ordered the slut.  One egg in a glass jar with potato and some bread.  Very good.  I enjoyed it except I was expecting a lot more for $11.  It was my first time there so I didn't really know what to expect.  My wife ordered the bacon egg and cheese.  She said it was not warm.  Line too long to complain about it.  She ordered a smart water which ended up being a life water.  Menu said $4, the charge was $4.50. My coffee was $5.  People who were in line behind us said they were going to McDonalds.  Would I go here again?  Maybe not to this location.  Hopefully the prices are lower in the stand alone locations.  The person taking my order was very friendly and took my name but must have spelled it different because they pronounced it wrong at the pick up.  They apparently did that to a few other people too.  There were people just sitting there waiting for their food and a different name was being called."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place before back in the Bay Area, California but never tried it. Luckily, Eggslut was less than a mile away from where we were staying at the Aria hotel. It's located inside the Cosmopolitan and there's always a line wrapped around the restaurant. But don't be too discouraged! The line moves quick and you'll be able to place your order in no time. Best part, you don't have to wait too long for the food as well!

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich (it comes with scrambled eggs, chives, grilled onions and a Siracha mayo) and my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger with a fried egg. Both were absolutely delicious! The eggs in the Fairfax sandwich was super fluffy and you can add bacon/turkey sausage/avocado for an additional cost. For me, the sandwich was very flavorful and adding bacon or sausage would be too salty for me. We also ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice ($5) Fresh and creamy! 

It is a little overpriced for the orange juice and sandwiches (we paid a little over $30 for two sandwiches, one orange juice and one bottled water) but it's super worth it. It's a good portion and it fills up your stomach!"}
{"text":"Since there isn't one of these close to NYC, like In-N-Out burger it's a must try when I'm out here in Vegas. However, I don't think I'm going to be waiting in line again for another Eggslut. Not that it's not good, it's just not anything that I haven't had  or couldn't have in many of the great breakfast places. 

My party tried the Eggslut, Gaucho and Fairfax. To me Gaucho was the best with quality and perfectly cooked steak,packed with good flavor from the chimichurri sauce. The Fairfax had the right running consistency in a soft scramble that I look for, but other than the chives all the other ingredients just disappeared into the background. Now the signature slut didn't live up to my perhaps overhyped expectations. Once you mix the egg in as they instruct you to do, the richness of the yolk is diluted to the point of being barely noticeable. A bit of a disappointment.

Check this one off my list. You won't find me online again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to make a visit whenever I was in LA but finally got to check it out in Vegas! There is always a long wait but I would say its worth it! The only time I didn't see a line was like early early morning. So after waiting in that long line, we finally ordered our sandwiches, we both got the Fairfax. It was delicious and satisfying! My husband loved it and wished he had ordered more. Too bad we don't have an Egg Slut over on the east coast!"}
{"text":"We all know how wonderful the food is at eggslut but today I want to commend one of their staff for going above and beyond. Marlon, you are a rockstar!! Thanks man!! Greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Do you like eggs?

If no, please do not come here.

If yes, please continue reading. They have 2 dishes that are must gets, the egg sandwich with sausage and the egg dip with bread. That's it. Get those, they're both amazing. The line is long in the morning for hungover Vegas partiers, so beware."}
{"text":"Very, very delicious breakfast foods and a variety of options. Some reviewers have cited the lines, but I'm not going to deduct stars for the lines, that is indicative of a good product for me. 

We went twice and the first time they were out of the signature dish, the Slut. We both got breakfast sandwiches (Fairfax and Sausage Egg & Cheese) and both were out of this world delicious.  All sandwiches made with brioche buns which are critical to flavor delivery and summarily fantastic.  On second visit, wait was longer, 45 minutes until order, but we lucked out and got Sluts! (It's hit or miss on the sluts, they are cooked sous vide and apparently become available in batches)  The Slut however was worthy of the flagship dish and delivered and made the wait worthwhile.  

Also worth trying is the house made biscuit, we also got a side salad on second visit. Both tasty side dishes.

This place is great and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. There is usually a long wait, so we went at midnight to beat the crowd ;) Tried their signature slut and gaucho sandwich .both were delicious."}
{"text":"I am officially a PROUD eggslut. I'm probably the nastiest one around! Lol I have heard so many great things about eggslut so I was ecstatic to know that I was staying at the hotel where it is located. It's inside of The Cosmopolitan on the second floor by The Chandelier. Yes...the line will be long and it wraps around the corner but the line moves quickly. We were waiting less than 10 minutes before we reached the counter and about 5 minutes to get our food. 

The menu is a decent size but the drinks are limited and pricey. $5 for a bottle of water...but hey, it's Vegas. You're supposed to throw away your money. I had the sausage, egg and cheese and it's amazing! It is greasy but that perfect if you have a hangover! They have chairs and tables to sit at (not many) and the soundtrack is very upbeat. I would eat an eggslut every morning if I could (pun highly intended) lol"}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast sandwich.

I stopped by on a Friday morning and had to wait about 20 minutes in a line that wrapped down a hallway, while I waited another 15 minutes for the sandwich to be made; it's generally pretty busy, so allot the appropriate amount of time to get a sandwich. Luckily, it's worth the wait, as the ingredients are all top notch (especially the bread, which is hefty enough to hold the ingredients), and the cheese and sauce all go well together. I'd definitely come back to have a breakfast sandwich on the go."}
{"text":"Wow! Great concept. Menu was simple and offered high quality ingredients. Food was fantastic! I got the Fairifax with added turkey sausage and avocado. Easily the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. Loved that they offered turkey sauage instead of pig (I don't eat mammals, so it was amazing to be able to eat sausage out.) Kitchen was fast, efficient and very clean. Staff was helpful and friendly even under the stress of serving a high volume of guests. I will be dreaming of my Eggslut sandwich and can't wait to return for more on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I loooove Eggslut! It's located on the second floor of The Cosmopolitan and it seems like there's always a line, but the food really is worth standing in line for! Plus the line moves pretty fast anyways. My girlfriend and I shared the Fairfax sandwich (with avocado and bacon added) and a \"slut\", and this was enough to fill both of us up! Both were so yummy that we came back and ordered the same exact thing the next day! :)

The Fairfax is honestly the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! It's scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo all on a brioche bun. & The avocado and bacon made for a delicious addition to it!

The Slut is a coddled egg (similar to a poached egg) on top of what I would call a mashed potato puree. It's served in a glass jar and you mix it all up and spread it on the baguettes it's served with. Different, but good! You can ask for extra baguettes when ordering and it's no charge. 

The drinks (coffee and oj) are definitely overpriced, but good. The orange juice was obviously fresh and tasted just like an orange. You can also ask for a refill of your coffee, and it's free!"}
{"text":"Egg slut is hands down amazing. The line is always long but well worth the wait. Everything on the menu is delicious. The eggs in a jar are my favorite!! Never go to Vegas without visiting. Can't go wrong with any of the entrees"}
{"text":"My brainchild idea of arriving at 8:00 a.m. was so original: although the line wrapped the corner it moved fast.  Then about seven minutes for the finished product.

The Fairfax delivered.  At home I blend mayonnaise in my scrambled eggs then cook slow and low; the taste was similar here.  The bun was very good, a little warmer would have been better.

$9 including tax doesn't scream value, but it's all part of reaching for your wallet when on The Strip."}
{"text":"Omg. Everyone who stayed in our room at the Cosmo hated me the day I ate here... the stories still haunt holiday gatherings, and a faint smell of melting wall paper lingers in my luggage. 

But the food. Who cares how my farts smell after eating here. The food is the TITS!"}
{"text":"We heard the hype about Eggslut so we were excited to try it. We came by around 8am and line wrapped around the corner. So we came back around 2pm and the line was fairly short. We got the Egg salad sandwich, Fairfax Sandwich, and Cheeseburger w/ Avocado. The Fairfax was okay. It tasted like really peppery. The Cheeseburger tasted better than the Fairfax, but my brother found a hair in it. It was good, but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"This restaurant provided us with a great experience. Our cashier, Martinez, did an amazing job and was super efficient at moving the line through fast. She handled two registers at once with ease. The food was also amazing, brioche bread makes for great egg sandwiches. Will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I went to the one in LA last year and wasn't impressed. Decided to give it another try when I saw there was an Eggslutt in Vegas. So glad I did!  I got the eggslutt and the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich which were both delicious!  Definitely a must try when you're in Vegas. I wish they opened later."}
{"text":"Love this place! I got the famous eggslut my husband got an egg sandwich they were both delicious wouldn't change a thing. I hope that the chain expands and we will get one in Northern California."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I have ever tasted. I had a Fairfax with turkey sausage, the eggs were scrambled. So soft and fluffy."}
{"text":"Heard about the hype around Eggslut and had to try it for myself. Conveniently I was staying the cosmopolitan and let me just say I was very very pleased. I had the sausage,egg and cheese. Sounds simple enough right? However, the way they cooked the eggs paired with the honey mustard aioli sauce between the warm brioche buns makes all the difference. The orange juice was fresh and excellent as well. My taste buds have been all over the place since I've been watching my diet and making better food choices but I got to say this was an excellent sandwich that I ate without any guilt, because what happens in Vegas................"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I got the Gaucho sandwich.  It was mostly arugula.  The tri tip was cold and flavorless.  The egg did absolutely nothing for the sandwich.  The biscuit was dry and cold.  Do yourself favor and never eat at eggslut."}
{"text":"Eggslut is the best breakfast in town. Yes, there is a line. Yes, it looks long. Never fear, it moves fast. I got in line this morning all the way back at the bathroom with people standing two and three wide and still had food in my mouth within 25 minutes. That's about the same as any other breakfast restaurant in town, except maybe a buffet that'd cost you three times as much for food half as good (at best).

My favorite is the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. The chipotle ketchup will blow your mind. Hovering somewhere between a salsa and a BBQ sauce, it's unique and tasty.

My wife likes the sausage, but it's a bit bland for my tastes. Their namesake dish, the slut, is mashed potatoes and a soft egg in a small glass jar with chives on top, served with toasted baguette slices. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned, but a bit small for the price IMO. If you've got a hangover, it'll help a lot though."}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich and also the slut. The slut I didn't like much as it was way too salty for my liking but the sandwich was on point definitely worth the 30 minutes line up wait."}
{"text":"I must admit, the name had my attention but the line had my interest going into hesitation. This is a walk up style breakfast spot. 
Seating can be a hassle when they are really busy. 
Food was great though."}
{"text":"Really good food overall but the only thing is the price for the food and drinks. I remember paying $4 for just a small Fiji water.
Pros is the amazing and fresh taste of the sandwich. My bacon was so crispy just the way I like it. The egg was just perfect too with the yolk still runny."}
{"text":"There is no better place to get an egg sandwich that tastes so wonderful that Eggslut in Vegas. The line proves that it is worth the wait. I did have to stand in line this morning for a sandwich, but that's ok; I have the time. Plus, for eggs done perfect then the wait is so worth it!

Now jus let getting to the front of the line; anticipation growing too. The cashier was very friendly and took my order with ease. After paying and getting the receipt I waited for the cooks to do their magic. The smells that tickle my nose are so amazing. The cook was busy and making the guests food. It was the cashier that runs the register and the front counter that placed my food in the bag and handed it to me. With this establishment so busy you would think that they could run two cashiers. Just a suggestion.

With the bag now in my hands I took it to eat in the car since I'm running behind. I had this time around the Eggslut with bacon, egg, and cheese. Yes it is fantastic and messy. It gets all over the place, but that is more of it to enjoy! If I could I would eat all my egg meals here."}
{"text":"This was delicious! There was a bit much matchup on mine but other than that we loved it! I got the bacon, egg, and cheese and my husband got the fairfax add bacon, which is key!"}
{"text":"Expected good food because the line was so long. I had the cheeseburger and my wife had the sausage egg and cheese sandwich. They were able to replace medium egg for scrambled and leave off the mustard aioli for my wife despite the long line. Good service. 

Pickles were really good in the burger. My over medium egg was perfect. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed out quick breakfast. Maybe a couple dollars overpriced but what expected given location in Cosmo."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend so had to stop and try it. The line is long, but worth the wait. The food is made fresh to order and comes out piping hot. The ingredients are quality. Ordered the Fairfax, cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Thought it was a restutant, it's a decent place though. Gotta eat here bc of the name. Not much seating menu is very small, you order and sit."}
{"text":"Eggslut!!


The original's from LA, 
That's where they got their fame.
Their specialty is obvious,
It's in their name. 

They're in the Cosmo,
Right off the strip.
Their meals are so good,
And worth the trip.

The lines are long,
But goes pretty quick. 
Is it the Slut or sandwiches?
Just take your pick.

The Slut is coddled egg,
On a potato puree. 
Not my favorite, had a taste,
And gave it away.

I like the Fairfax,
It's scrambled with cheese.
The burger is awesome,
Make it a double, please.

The bacon and cheese is simple,
And taste pretty good.
Egg lovers unite!
Come here, you should.

They're closed at night,
And that's my tip.
They also have delicious cookie,
Made with chocolate chip.  

I'll be back for more, 
It's a matter of time.
I'm a fan of Eggslut, 
Now that's the bottom line."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. This place is amazing! The name is odd and hilarious. The food is amazing. This place is so busy for breakfast but the service is quick. I had a sandwich but they have some concoction with eggs served in a jar. However, most people seemed to order sandwiches when I was there. Next time in Vegas, I will return."}
{"text":"Worth the visit to the Cosmopolitan!

The sausage sandwich was soooooooo good making the late night munchies go away. There is always a line but they filter through it pretty quick.

BRING ONE TO THE BAY AREA!!!"}
{"text":"Real good food ! Customer service from silki was horrible has no manners shouldn't have her working at the food pick up center when she looks miserable working giving everyone attitude when picking up their food. It's really a bad experience to have someone so miserable doing their job the last thing you see from such a good place."}
{"text":"Wanted to try Egg Slut in Grand Central for a long time but the queues were way to long.  Great surprise to see an Egg Slut in Vegas last weekend with a tiny line (it was 8.30am)!  I was slutty enough the have the Fairfax, not slutty enough to have the Slut!  Melt in the mouth brioche with wonderful caramelized onions and cheese.  Perfect for the morning after!
Not many tables but people were ordering to go so that was a plus.  Quick service.  Be kind if you go there - eat and leave, no chatting for hours taking up a table someone else needs."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place since friends and family spoke highly of it. We stood in line for a little over an hour. The place was small and limited seating. My sandwich had way too much sauce on it, which made my buns soggy and that was all I could taste. I ended up eating it without the buns. Disappointed but I'd give it another try, and hopefully I'll see what everyone's raving about."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff overpriced greasy egg sandwiches I feel like I could've got a nice breakfast somewhere else I won't be back in the saddle part is I've been wanting to try this place out for a while I also thought it was a restaurant where you have service where you ordered food at the counter"}
{"text":"It was really nice :) My friends were visiting and they liked! I personally liked eggsalad sandwich the most."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning. It took us 30 minutes to get to the ordering counter another 10-15 to get our food. The line wraps around into a small hallway that's \"behind\" the kitchen so it's kinda weird when people exit the kitchen and there's a door separating the line. I can tell it confuses people who assume the line is short only to find out it extends past that door. 

The good thing is that it's a limited menu so there's not too many people holding up the line with their decisions. The assembly line is really fun to watch while waiting for your food. I got the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. Maybe it's because people hyped it up too much or maybe I should've got the #instaworthy Slut, but to me it wasn't great."}
{"text":"Got here at 6:55am on Monday and there was already 7 people in line (opens at 7am), but the wait wasn't bad - the kitchen was all ready to go.  They offer a gluten free bun now for an extra $1.  

Got the Fairfax with avocado and bacon (avocado wasn't quite ripe yet) without a bun (they substituted with a salad) - it was decent, nothing that special - kind of like any breakfast sandwich.  However, the Slut was really different and delicious - never had anything quite like this.  The soft egg on top of the pureed potatoes was smooth and yummy.  Good prices for a decent breakfast - rare for Vegas."}
{"text":"Good place.  Ate here twice while staying in Las Vegas.  Egg sandwiches are really good.  The buns they use are terrific.  Personally, I wasn't impressed with the signature eggslut dish.  The first time we went, they were all out of eggsluts.  Would be at least 20min before anymore were ready, and it was a long wait in line.  Got it by going real early in the morning the second time.  Was alright, just not anything special to me.  There is very little room to stay around and eat.  We just found some places to sit nearby."}
{"text":"They've cleverly positioned this place right outside Marquee nightclub in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and it's delicious. Every morning there's a long line for their sandwiches, but if you come in the off hours there's no line at all and trust me, it's worth it. 
Had the fairfax sandwich and it was delicious. Really excited to go to LA and try some of their other signature sandwiches now. 
As with other reviewers, price is a bit high or it'd be a full 5-stars."}
{"text":"If you love eggs Eggslut is the place for you! There is always a line to get food here. There is a very good reason! Get a Slut! 

Highly recommend Eggslut!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good bfast spot to eat at.. the only thing is .. its a lil over priced..  and there is only a few sandwiches to choose from.."}
{"text":"After a long Vegas weekend (you know, you've been there too...) we were looking for a place to grab a bite before the long road back to San Diego. It dawned on me that a lot of people come here for breakfast/brunch/food in general so I suggested here!

The line is long, read the rest of the reviews, they'll all tell you. We ended up waiting about a half hour but I would say it was worth the wait! Next time, drop someone off at the Cosmopolitan and have them stand in line while you go park the car in their lot. I recommend walking if you can? If you're not in and out of that lot in an hour you'll have to pay $7. 

After a grueling wait after a night of drinking and other festivities these sandwiches are exactly what you need. I ended up getting two sandwiches: The Fairfax with bacon and the sausage, egg, and cheese and it was my first step on the road to hangover recovery. I loved the Fairfax the best. Light, creamy scrambled eggs and smoky bacon with a little spicy kick from the sriracha mayo was the best thing I could have. The sausage, egg, and cheese also didn't disappoint but the sausage was a little herby and it got a little messy because of the runny egg, but who doesn't LOVE a runny egg?

I would say it's worth the wait! Next time I'm back in Vegas I'll be back here to try their signature slut out and maybe a biscuit!"}
{"text":"Wow!  All I can say is this place lives up to the hype! I've been to the LA location and fell in love. I've been in this city for many years and have seen other cities trendy and delicious restaurants come to Vegas and miss the mark. It seems that the bigger names tend to think their reputation will carry them, however not the case with Eggslut at Cosmo! The Fairfax with bacon was just as I remembered it, plush brioche, siracha mayo, and that delicious soft scramble with cheddar and onion. 

On a side note I heard this place opened just 2 days ago and couldn't believe it. Now that I know Eggslut has a home in Vegas it will definitely be my new late night spot!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday morning and there was a long wait. I got an egg slut and biscuit. Both tasted amazing. The baguette was drizzled with olive oil and went well with the egg slut. The biscuit was buttery and soft on the inside but crispy on the outside. They give butter and maple syrup to be eaten with the biscuit. This is on the 2nd floor across the Chandelier bar."}
{"text":"First, the line is long, but well worth it and it actually goes by pretty fast. Food is served in an efficient time and the staff is awesome. We ordered the Sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, the fairfax sandwich, biscuit, salted chocolate cookie, OJ, and cold brew. A lot of food right!! We wanted to try all that we could. Let's just say I was blown away with the quality of the food even with the large crowd they have to serve. The food and service was awesome. Don't be intimidated by the line, go try this place!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. This place does not have a lot of seating so if you have a big party it is best to take it to go. The line can get long pretty fast. Their sandwiches are pretty good. I ordered the Fairfax and egg salad sandwich. Make use of the fork. The Fairfax is creamy and can get messy. (If you take out the sandwich the egg will spill out). The arugula goes well with the egg salad. I think this a 1 place you should try if you're in vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down this is definitely the spot! 

This egg sandwich is king to all other egg sandwiches with its cooked just right eggs and its fluffy brioche bun. I ordered the egg,bacon and cheese sounds simple but with great flavor. The egg was cage free cooked medium, flavorful bacon and cheddar. I would have loved to try the others and might go back before we head out of town. 

Price wise you can't beat it. My sandwich was around $8 bucks and when you compare prices this is still the cheaper better option."}
{"text":"Pictures from eggslut's L.A. Location on Instagram had been making my mouth water for so long. So when I came to Vegas and saw they had this location at the Cosmopolitan, right across from the famous Chandelier lounge, I had to come. There was a huge line, about a half hour wait, but totally worth it. 
 

I had the gaucho, which is an Argentinian style prime roast sandwich, with a fried egg, topped with an amazing chimi churri sauce. The buns they use are also sooooo fresh. They also serve fresh squeezed orange juice and amazing fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.

It is basically a cafeteria style sandwich place but these gourmet egg sandwiches are to die for. It's a perfect addition to the decadent Vegas lifestyle, if you are looking for a quick little hangover breakfast that will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"Saw all the rave reviews for both locations and had to check out Eggslut at the Cosmopolitan.
 
I had an overall average experience. Food was okay and the cost was expected so I was able to focus on the quality of my sandwich.

Arrived around 10 am and the line was ridiculously long so I decided to come back later around 2 pm after some shopping and there was no line! 

Ordered The Fairfax with sausage and bacon. 

The eggs were way too wet for a breakfast sandwich resulting in all the contents slithering out from between the brioche buns and making a huge gooey, greasy, cheesy mess. Brioche was too thick but flavorful and lightly sweetened. The bacon was decent and had a little fat to it. The hand pressed turkey sausage breakfast patty had a nice kick to it. I would stick to either bacon or sausage next time, not both, and make sure to get extra napkins. There is also a fancy sauce they put on that has a little punch to it as well. It is a big sandwich. You could definitely split one. 

Coming back to try the Slut and possibly another sandwich to see if it's worthy of another star.

What I really like about Eggslut is the short menu. There are limited choices but I would order any of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you want the perfect complement to a Vegas vacation full of debauchery and spending, look no further. If you're a local with no other reason to be on the Strip, then keep looking.

Eggslut is an LA import that's set up shop in a very prominent second-floor corner space just off the East elevators of the Cosmopolitan. It's quite easy for locals to access from the underground parking structure (which is set up with red and green lights to indicate occupied and free parking spaces, respectively).

I'm not sure whether it was the conference being held upstairs or just the usual busy traffic, but I spent 40 minutes waiting in line starting at just before 10am on a Thursday. The food came out fairly quickly after that, and seats were somehow available at the long communal high top (in retrospect, I can see why).

Gaucho ($15): seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, seasoned arugula, egg over medium, warm brioche bun. Steak was tender, marbled, and pink. Arugula was the most distinctive of the veggies. Brioche was a bit insubstantial, but I enjoyed every bite of the rather small sandwich.

Slut ($10): coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Gotta mix thoroughly with the provided spoon for full effect. It's a silky mixture that is seasoned just right, but perhaps reads a little more of the potato than egg. Also, a fourth slice of crunchy bread would've been right for this portion because I couldn't see how we would've heaped all of the jar's contents onto the crostini that we had.

Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($4.50): house-made dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt. This is on the large side of cookies but is still a pretty outrageous price, especially considering that it's just good. There's plenty of chocolate, but I don't get the same flavor in the dough as other great cookies and it's annoying to have to spread the salt around to get it in every bite.

I was happy in the moment with the flavors of the food, but it left me feeling regretfully unsatisfied when I got hungry again at lunch time (having split both entrees evenly with my friend). In a way, that makes a Eggslut a perfect symbol of Vegas."}
{"text":"I only gave this two stars because the lady at the registered gave me a free orange juice. But the food was horrible, like literally the worst sandwich I have ever tasted. I would have preferred getting McDonald's. On top of that the lady who was handing the food was so rude. No smile, no good morning, she should have just thrown my food at me."}
{"text":"I will admit Eggslut pulled me in with the name. Luckily the name was not the only good things about the experience. My husband and I went on a Sunday morning and the line was long. It took about an hour to get to the counter. But we went and got snacks at Momofuku Milk Bar so it was all good.

We ordered a slut and the bacon egg sandwich. The sandwich was good - bacon was ample, bread was soft. But the real star of the show was the slut. So simple yet so good. A coddled egg over mashed potatoes with chives, served with a side of bread.  It was salty, soft delicious awesomeness. The bread could have used more butter but the egg was so good that it kinda didn't matter. My new mission in life is to figure out how to recreate this dish at home since there is no Eggslut in Phoenix. 

Get in line. Get a slut. Get happy."}
{"text":"Came here to try the slut specifically and we were not disappointed. It was really, really good. Also had the fairfax sandwich which was great. There can be a bit of a line here if you're coming for breakfast but it's worth the wait. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Fairfax with turkey sausage is the best egg sandwich I've ever had. The wait is worth it (and I rarely say that) and getting The Slut is a must."}
{"text":"Overrated. Period. Mediocre at best really. If I was staying at the hotel I'd probably pop in for a breakfast sandwich because it's not bad, but I'd never make a trip from anywhere else. The warm chocolate chip cookies do deserve 4 stars for sure though."}
{"text":"Stopped in on an early weekday morning recently. Very short line, I was pleasantly surprised! I've seen how the line at the LA location gets and I was fully expecting to wait. Sure glad that wasn't the case! 

I ordered the slut, some fresh oj, and some water. I forgot about requesting extra bread like someone had suggested but that was okay! Delicious! I love potatoes so I knew we were going to get along just fine. I would have liked a bit more chives but I'm probably in the minority. I did feel like I could have easily asked for chives and been accommodated.  Choice of music blasting here was nice and all throwbacks when I went which I really enjoyed. 

It was fun to sit and eat and people watch. Because it was a weekday morning, there was a good mix of locals who worked nearby, business people, and tourists. I will stop by again next time to try a sandwich!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Definitely a must get when in Vegas! It's worth the line for breakfast or come at lunch when there isn't as long of a line."}
{"text":"I've been to eggslut in LA so I was really looking forward to eating at their Vegas location. I feel like the food is the same but the feeling of the food is not the same. I just feel like it's almost out of place in Vegas. The eggslut in Cali is so perfect. It's in the beautiful outdoor space in the grand central market. You can get a sandwich and eat it on the counters with the breeze hitting your face. You feel relaxed and can enjoy the simplicity of your sandwich. The Vegas eggslut location is in the cosmopolitan hotel. There's not enough seating. There's a loud ruckus. The environment is way to hustle and bustle for you to truly enjoy the simple sandwich known as egg sandwiches. 

I would order the fairfax. It's loaded with cheese and eggs of course. Add the bacon and avocado  for only a few bucks more. I would also recommend their slut. It's a bit awkward to order, but it's a great addition to your breakfast. I will have to warn you that it is a bit salty so make sure you leave some bread from your sandwich to use as extra dipping bread. 

I would not order their egg salad! It was bland and super dry. I give their egg salad a 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Eggslut for their product and business expansion. They've selected great locations to expand their business from grand central market in DTLA. 

I always get The fairfax- it's delicious! They pair their sauces so well with eggs and condiments. 

Downside of Eggslut: there's a line to place your order and also picking up your order. 

I think the hype is real and the food is great-it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The Slut: A poached egg served in a glass jar atop of potato puree.

Who knew something so simple could be so fucking good?! This spot opens at midnight, so it's the perfect late night snack spot. If you don't like egg or don't like eating in general, then may I recommend the original slut, served at Sapphire or Spearmint Rhino."}
{"text":"I love eggs so the name itself caught my attention. Located next to the Marquee Club. I was suprised with the music, the old school hip hop playing on the speakers was jammin! Get a guacho burger and the slut, you won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"OK, the food here is good people.  I will definitely give it that...  But not good enough to stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour as some did.  we walked up and the lone was around the corner into the ladies bathroom hallway!  

NOPE, walked over to Holstein amd had a snack, chilled, had a drink.  Walked out and saw...  WHAT???  No line???

Walked in, order my breakfast sandwich and cookie...  Both good, but not OMG I've got to have this again.

Would come back?  Hmmmmm....  Still debating that."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. You NEED to have a slut when you come here, no excuses. And it's not my fault if you love them so much you buy a sous vide cooker and spend hours experimenting just to figure out how to make one. Because that totally didn't happen to me. At all. Just order a slut, no questions asked. And if you don't trust my advice (which you should) any of their breakfast sandwiches are ."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The items are affordable as long as you don't order drinks. A paper cup of coffee (maybe 10 oz?) Is $4.50."}
{"text":"Hipster breakfast. The line was long but moved efficiently. 
Waiting 20+ minutes for a breakfast sandwich seems a tad excessive if I'm not on vacation. 
The \"slut\" is basically a medium cooked egg over mashed potatoes. Salty and tasty. 
Sausage egg and cheese biscuit on brioche bun is a fancy McMuffin. 
After tax and tip $27 for breakfast. 
Easy seating across from the restaurant. 
Coffee is better at Starbucks nearby."}
{"text":"So first of all, this restaurant has a very interesting name. I was also drawn to this restaurant to try their food because of their name. The food was pretty good, And the staff was OK in regards to their service. If you were looking for and OK egg type sandwich that's overpriced them this is the place for you! In my opinion, This place is for the drunk people that get out of the club."}
{"text":"I've heard of the LA location before, but never got the chance to try it. Eggslut recently opened this Vegas location, so it was a convenient visit since I'm in town. They're located in the Cosmopolitan on the second floor right across from Marquee.

I came around 11am on a Saturday and the line was a 25~ minute wait to order. I got the Fairfax Sandwich ($8) and it was pretty good. It was served on a warm brioche bun and filled with scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo. These ingredients transpired into a delicious breakfast sandwich. Add-ons include: bacon ($4), turkey sausage ($4), and avocado ($2). The avocado was tempting but I restrained after seeing the price, quite expensive...

Portion wise, it's a bit small so if you're very hungry, it will not be a satisfying meal. However, if you're looking for something light in preparation for a buffet or something later on in the evening, Eggslut is a great option for a brunch snack."}
{"text":"Had a bite for breakfast one morning after getting up fairly early to beat the crazy lines.  In the 3 days we stayed at the Cosmo the line for this spot is 30 people deep after 8am.  Overall it was ok.  Had the bacon egg and cheese.  I can get a better version in Jersey in any corner deli.  It was all bread. The brioche can't handle the runny egg and bacon grease.  This thing disintegrated in my hands at first bite.  Not the best crafted sandwich.  I think the idea behind the spot along with the marketing is better than the end product."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must! I'm a HUGE fan of eggs and just breakfast in general. They ran out of eggsluts when I was there last time but the sandwiches were just as delicious. The \"slut\" is a soft boiled egg in a cute mini jar with toast served on the side.  It was very busy during the breakfast time, but we went a little bit after lunch hour and it was not busy at all. There won't be many places to sit if it's busy as the seating is limited. The line moves very fast though even when it is busy. 

It is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel!"}
{"text":"This is on my 'must visit' list while in town.  I can't quite figure out why this simple egg place hits the mark so well. 

Is it the perfect cooked - not too wet, not too hard fried and scrambled eggs?  Is it the chimichurri  sauce on the gaucho?  Is it the siracha mayo?  The soft brioche bun?  

Who knows. But you gotta try this place in town.  There's always a long line, but it moves fast and it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best name of a restaurant that I've ever seen in my life so I recommend checking it out. It would be even better if there was a \"cum n' go\" has statoon next to it!"}
{"text":"This was a great find.  It was a little bit of a wait to get my sandwich but the sandwich was well worth it.  I ordered the fairfax sandwich and it was amazing.  The mixture of eggs, chives, and sriracha mayo was perfect. I would definitely go back on my next time out there."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Affordable, convenient, delicious. What else do you need? The line gets long but it moves fast and is worth it."}
{"text":"Egg slut has been on my \"to try\" list for a while now. I've never been able to make it up to Grand Central Market before there's a long line, I made sure I had to try it when I was in Vegas. I made the mistake of going on a Saturday though when there are a lot more tourists in town - annnnnnd especially going at peak hours...

It's located in the Cosmo on the second floor next to Holstein's and right across from the line to enter Marquee Day Club. When I arrived the end of the line was right in front of the restroom in the adjacent hallway. We got to the counter by a few minutes shy of 12:10PM and then got our food around 12:30PM. There's limited seating but it clears up fast, my boyfriend and I were able to grab 2 bar seats at the counter right after we got our food. 

We ordered the gaucho, the cheeseburger, and the slut. I had intended to try their breakfast sandwiches, but I'm not a big cheese person so I felt like I wouldn't be doing their food justice ordering the breakfast sandwiches and opting out cheese... so I decided to get the gaucho. It's waygu tri tip with chimichurri sauce, argula, and an over medium egg. The sandwich was decent, my yolk was on the other side of my sandwich so once I bit into it, it squished the sandwich and caused the yolk to pop and exit out of the sandwich into the wrapper... so I didn't get the full experience :-( it was still good, however I could have used a little more seasoning/salt.

I was looking forward to the slut - we were advised to make sure all layers were fully mixed in together before eating it. After it was all mixed up it kind of reminded me of those fake watery mashed potatoes you'd get from the frozen tv dinners.

Egg slut is good, but from everything I've heard I was expecting it to change my life and it didn't. Maybe if the wait wasn't so long I would have enjoyed it more but being in line in a small hallway next to restrooms wasn't exactly the best precursor to a meal."}
{"text":"We ordered a slut, a gaucho sandwich, and a fairfax (with turkey sausage)

Were they delicious?  Yea.  Everything was really good.
Were they so delicious that the memory of eating them will stay with me for the rest of my years?  No.
Was it worth waiting in what I think was ~30-40m line?  No.
Was it worth the price (about $40 for those 3 items)?  No.
Would I come back here again?  If the line is short and I'm in the area, sure.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here though."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! We love the quality of the food, it's consistently great! I keep the glass jar that's served with the eggslut!"}
{"text":"The line is super long so get ready to wait. The menu is very millennial people oriented. BOMB ^___^ I treied the slut (was expecting bigger portions which disappointed me but the bread is really fresh and flavorful and super creative to add the mashed potatoes in to dip the  bread in )"}
{"text":"Got the sausage, egg, & cheese and was certainly impressed with the quality and taste. The price of ~$8 seemed high but I would say was worth it. The reason I put 3 stars is that it took roughly 30 minutes in line and then another 15 to actually get the food though followed by another wait to try and find adequate seating. While a great sandwich, the price + wait just was not a recipe for a good experience & I would pass if I was given the opportunity again."}
{"text":"Super satisfying. I went two mornings in a row while in Vegas. There is always a line but it moves quickly thanks to their efficient assembly line style service."}
{"text":"Yes!Yes! and Yes! I have been trying to try the one in LA for the longest but I can never seem to make it time before they close so this place was a must in Vegas. 

I came on a early Saturday morning and as U expected there was a line but that didn't stop me from standing in it. I ordered the Slut and omg guys it was soooo good! It is like mash potatoes and eggs runny style, just the way I like and the taste is pure blissfull goodness! 

I have to admit i was expecting it to be all hype and no good but boy was I completely wrong. I am definitely going to have to get up early enough to catch the one in LA, this is a must! I you're on the Strip stop by!"}
{"text":"While the location proves to be more or less inconvenient for anyone outside The Cosmopolitan and the limited seating proves to be a challenge should you order the Slut, the food is pretty worth going a bit out of the way for.

The Bacon and Egg Sammie was awesome - if the chipotle ketchup wasn't enough to make the sammich excellent with its lingering heat, the massive pile of bacon on it certainly did.

The Slut - oh, where to start? Just order it. With the amazing potato purée the texture was incredible and off-set by the baguette."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Somebody became a genius overnight! THE eggslut is it! Potatoes and running eggs! All they need is to add bacon! You should do it! You can never have enough bacon --in my opinion! Next, I had the Gaucho!! Eggcellent!! Add bacon!! Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: clean with chicken related accents everywhere. Music was hip hop and you can definitely have a conversation here. 

Service: we were here on a weekday at 10am and waited about half an hour in line before we could order but the orders were filled quickly. My order came out within 10 minutes. Everybody was friendly and looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs.


Food:

Gaucho: (5/5) 

Seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun. Tri-Tip: Snake River Farms, Boise ID. 

I thought theyd give me tiny slices of wagyu but there was quite a generous amount. It was tender, juicy, and filling. The chimichurri complimented it well. The brioche bun was light and sweet with an egg glaze (yes the bun matters to me). The arugula was fresh. The egg was in deed over medium. I would 100% recommend. Everything else looked good but my asian family has been adding over easy eggs to everything to make it taste even better for a long time so it wasnt anything special to me. I.e. i wouldnt wait in line for anything other than the gaucho.



Overall: 4/5 recommendation for everything else
5/5 if youre hung over"}
{"text":"The line was a little daunting but worth the wait. I could eat their biscuits ALL day. The brioche buns used for their breakfast sandwiches were absolutely amazing. They go a little heavy on the cheese which is normally pretty awesome, but it made the sandwich fall apart and a little hard to eat."}
{"text":"The line here is long, but moves at a decent pace. I thought this place is  definitely worth a try. The \"Slut\" is definitely something unique and pretty good, but is a bit pricey. I also ordered one of their sandwiches and an orange juice. The amount of orange juice given was not worth the cost, but I expected as much from a hyped up restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"If you're an egg person like me, the long line is totally worth it! Had the Slut, Fairfax Sandwich, Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich AND the GAUCHO!!! All were great!"}
{"text":"Crazy awesome breakfast on the strip! There was a bit of line, which I was prepared for, but it was well worth it. My boyfriend and I ordered the bacon and egg sandwich and the Slut! The sandwiches were awesome, especially with the house made chipotle ketchup and the slut was indescribable. It was almost reminiscent of potato salad but insanely smooth and rich. The baguette pieces added the perfect textural element. In comparison to the other offerings on the Strip, it's definitely great $$ vale too!"}
{"text":"Decent but I'm not sure if the food is necessarily worth the hype and wait time. 4 stars for food, but that combined with the wait time pushes it lower to 3 for me."}
{"text":"OMG! Eggslut's food is amazing!!! We had the Gaucho and Slut, and they were so delicious!! Gaucho is made out of tender and juicy wagyu beef, with arugula. The Slut is so creative, with egg and potato puree, self-spread on baked crispy bread. 
I love it that they're open 24 hours. We had no line at 3 am in the morning (duh lol). Such good comfort and breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. It's in the Cosmopolitan which is a beautiful property in itself. The line is long but I would say worth it. Would I wait an hour no but twenty minutes is fine. For Vegas the prices are reasonable and the quality of food and portions are on par with what you are paying. $8 for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and also $8 for the fairfax which is a breakfast sandwich with eggs cheese caramelized onions and Sriracha mayo, might be forgetting an ingredient here. Both sandwiches very high quality with fresh ingredients. The bread they use is fresh and very fluffy. I believe it comes from a local bakery. Also the name is fun, eggslut. Say it three times. It's Vegas so you can't really be offended. I wouldn't order juice or coffee here because it's way overpriced but great food, and then you can find a nice sofa at the Cosmo to sit on and enjoy! They have sofas near the chandelier bar nearby which aren't used in the morning. You will find people enjoying their sandwiches here. Just bring napkins!"}
{"text":"Eggslut for after clubbing, Eggslut for waking up on the strip hungover, Eggslut for a quick study break, Eggslut because I was in the the neighborhood. Breakfast food all day. 
Having had the original Eggslut in LA, I can tell you it's just as good. Don't expect anything fancy, it's just an egg sandwich. But it will be a really, really good egg sandwich. If you don't know anything about the restaurant you'll probably order the Slut, but don't. It's more expensive than anything else on the menu and the portion is really small. But don't get me wrong, it's pretty freakin good. 
I like the Fairfax, but pay extra to add meat. The Bacon, egg and cheese is just as good though so if you spent too much in the club, maybe stick to that. 
Park in the West side elevators- direct access to Eggslut!"}
{"text":"OMG OMNOMNOM
seriously good brekkie sammich but that line was so long and so slow. Almost not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ok now I understand the hype. It lies not only in the egg, but in the bread. The bread is so soft and sweet. It was nice there was little wait here as well. Definitely give this place a shot during the late night hours."}
{"text":"So I've heard so much about this place and never got to try it until now. I heard some mixed reviews about this place so I decided to check it out myself. The place is small, kind of like a to go place. You place your order and once your order is up, you pick up your food. There are some bar chairs that surrounds the place. And it has an open kitchen so you could see everything the chef does to your food! 

I got the Fairfax sandwich. It was really good!! It came with scrambled eggs, chives, onions, cheese, and a sriracha mayo sauce. It tastes exactly like a breakfast sandwich. The first couple of bites were amazing...and then the taste got a little overwhelming. All in all, this sandwich was really good! Just can't have too much of it. 

The total for that sandwich was around $8. So really not bad at all for a burger/sandwich. And their menu isn't big either, so it makes it easier to choose what you want. And I love their times! They're only closed a couple hours and they reopen again. So perfect for the nightlife in Vegas. But be warned...the line gets super long during 2am because its literally right next door to Marquee Nightclub"}
{"text":"People complain saying, \"wahhh, the line is long\" and the food is \"mediocre\". First of all, please name a better breakfast place than here with quality food? The food here is amazing. They have the same menu lineup, prices, food quality, and the wait line is similar to LA. 

I highly recommend the Fairfax with bacon. Brioche and eggs melt in your mouth while the bacon has a good crunch. 

Anyway, off my rant. If you don't want to pay \"high\" prices and wait, go to mcdonalds. Stop complaining and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place for months! And it didn't disappoint. The eggs are super fluffy and the onions and spicy sauce are the perfect additions. The pretzel bun is soft and buttery, making it the perfect bite. I think it needs some crunch though! Each sandwich is hand made and the eggs are all made individually. But it's not super fast and there is always a line! So make sure you have time! Also it is pricy. A eggs sandwich is about $9 each."}
{"text":"Not worth the long line or $! And to top it off the cashier didn't give me the correct change and when I pointed out that she gave me $1 instead of the $11 I was owed she said she did give me $11. Hello?! I'm standing here with $1 and the receipt in my hand. Disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"So amazingly yummy, I can't even describe my happiness after eating this. The Slut is to die for. I need another. Probably the best hang over food ever!"}
{"text":"Dam that slut was good. Had this delivered to me by a friend in the morning and it was so good. I had the egg salad sandwich and it was tasty. It was just the perfect size for me. I heard from my friends that their sausage sandwich was good too. Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Bacon egg and cheese was about 8 to 9 dollars. The bun was good, they add a lot of bacon. Unlike most breakfast sandwhiches they seem to put about what it  seems to be 4 or 5 slices of bacon. Surprisingly a lot. 
Only problem is they are pretty pricey. Then again this is vegas. Food is in demand and they are quality food."}
{"text":"The only slut I'll ever approve of. Eggslut. Arriving in Vegas at 7 am and being too early to check in the hotel, breakfast was the next best thing besides a bed.

I've seen that lines can be all the way around the corner if you come around lunch time. Since we were early, it wasn't that bad. Yet.

Choosing off reviews and pictures, I got the Slut and the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. The Slut is probably the most popular, but for the price, I don't think I'd get it again. The egg itself was really good and I would have never thought about adding a potato purée. The downside was that it came with three little pieces of toasted baguette. You'll definitely still feel hungry if that's all your getting. Luckily, I also had the sandwich. Nothing too fancy from your typical breakfast sandwich. I'm more satisfied with a McGriddle from Mickey D's. Meh.

It's something that you should check out if you've never had it, but it isn't something I'd wait 40 minutes for. It's a one time thing for me. Didn't hate it, but didn't love it either."}
{"text":"McDonalds has better egg sandwiches than this restaurant. I waited in line for 30 minutes for an egg sandwich that cost $9.20. The eggs and turkey was inedible. I ended up just eating the bun. Go to fast food chain before you waste both your time and money."}
{"text":"The line is a bit off putting but it moves quickly and the quality of food is worth the wait. Consistently delicious and the egg is always perfectly cooked whether you order poached or scrambled. Definitely an experience worth having when you're in Vegas (or DTLA)."}
{"text":"True breakfast delight. Line will be long but worth the wait and moves somewhat at a decent speed. We waited about 10-15 minutes to order I would say. Interesting concept and the slut was delectable. I should've gotten two though - they are a little on the smaller side if you have a big appetite.  Also, it's hard to find a seat so we had to find seats elsewhere in the lobby to sit and eat. I want to learn how to make sluts at home now."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches hands down worth the 30 min wait in line... slut was good too... my favorite was the cookie! I guess I will be eating here more often."}
{"text":"First Eggslut experience. I've heard good things about the California locations and was happy to see they opened one here at the Cosmo. I've heard about the insane lines this place could have, so I decided to hit it up at 3pm with some friends. 

I really wanted to get the gaucho but I was worried the steak might be a little tough to eat one handed. (I was holding my 10 month old son in my other hand because they don't have high chairs and I didn't expect them to). I ended up ordering the cheeseburger. The bun was the star - it had this beautiful glow and hint of slight sweetness to it. The pickles and caramelized onions were a nice touch, but the patty was really lacking in size. We're talking McDonald's size cut here.

The slut - very creative and festive in its own little jar. It was perfectly seasoned and served at the right temperature. I wish there would have been just a little more bread. 3 little slices was not enough to compliment the slut. 

Overall experience - I wouldn't get the burger again. It was kinda steep at $10 for a McDonald's sized patty and no extras or sides. The slut was also $10, also a little steep but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  Would I go again? Sure, I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and will try something different next time. 

By the way, they don't serve ice/tap water. You have to buy their overpriced smart water if you want an H2O fix."}
{"text":"I have to say I was surprised that they would have the same quality and be  just as good as the location in the Grand Central Market in LA, so I have to say this is a must go place after an long night on the strip."}
{"text":"Went here this morning around 8:30 am and there was a little line going. The line moved really quick. I liked that they had a couple large menus posted on the wall so you could figure out what you wanted before it's your turn to order. Friendly and efficient staff. I had the Fairfax and added bacon and avocado and it was soooo good. Definitely coming back next time I'm in vegas. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is disgusting. It is literally filthy. We were in the mood for eggs midday and it was convenient so we decided to try it. The line was short but very slow moving. They took payment quickly and as we waited at least 15 minutes for essentially an egg sandwich we realized the tables were all filthy. They were covered with grease marks, crumbs, salt, crumpled napkins. The young help stayed behind the counter chatting with each other. No one to clean tables in that crew. Also they don't give tap water, only small bottled water for $5 a hit. When we finally got our sandwiches they were falling apart out of the little bags (further explaining the general pigginess of the place). We've eaten in many fast food places from McDonalds to lesser knowns and many in between and we are truly surprised that a health authority doesn't shut this disgusting place down until they clean up their act. Worst food place we've ever seen in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has the longest line every time I visit Vegas.  I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese and hubby ordered the Fairfax.  The best thing about this sandwich is the brioche bun and the eggs of course. It is not easy making the perfect egg but I think they have mastered it. I will definitely be back to order the Slut."}
{"text":"Maybe i'm bias because I am not an egg fan. Came here after a heavy night of drinking because duh, we're in Vegas. All my friends wanted to try it out so I thought what the heck, why not. I ordered the egg sandwich with the steak like meat and a arugula with my egg over hard just like I like it. Not worth my money. Everything tasted alright just not my cup of tea. 

However, my friends got the egg slut which looked like a little jar with egg and got bread to dip. Apparently thats the to-go. Everyone said it was amazing so if you're gonna try one thing I think this is the one you should go for. They also tried the sausage and egg one which they said was an upgraded egg and sausage mcmuffin. If you're an egg fan I'm sure you'd love it and just enjoy drowning in the running eggy-ness."}
{"text":"Trying to learn to like this place. My cousins love it here cause they love eggs but I'm ok about it. It's a cute and cool concept but I feel like the price is kinda overpriced. It's like $4-5 for a water or a coke here. I've tried their cheeseburger and the slut here and it was good. Their arugula salad is plain wasn't too exciting. I would recommend just getting a sandwich here."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant/take out when looking for low carb / keto food options. You can pretty much make everything low carb here by just skipping the bread or subbing with salad. I went with the bacon, egg and cheese 'sandwich', no bun, with avocado. The bacon was perfectly crispy, the cheese cpuld have been melted a bit more and the egg was deliciously runny. Loved that the salad was arugola too. Why 4*? We waited about 25min in line and I felt like 10.50$ was a bit much for a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was okay.
Not amazing but pretty good.
Asked to give them a tip at cashier and i gave $5 not knowing eveything here is self service.

Waited 30 mins and i realized that they skipped my order bc people behind me were getting their orders. When i asked them if my order is ready they did not say any word. Waited another 10 min and i recoeved \"some\" of my order and she said rest will be ready soon. Waited another 20 mins then i asked for refund for the food that i did not get. 

I will never go back to eggslut. Its not worth spending  hour waiting."}
{"text":"Located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, my cousin and I came here last week to eat our first meal in Vegas. We arrived around 11ish and the line was super long which looped past the bathrooms. We waited about 30 minutes + until we got to the front of the line. Finding seats is a battle royale (ok not really, but you gotta run when seats open up fast!).

I had the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, and my cousin had the Fairfax; We shared the Slut. The sandwiches were so good, worth the long wait. The Slut was my favorite. It's the type of dish that you eat leisurely. The mixture of coddled egg in puréed potatoes spread on bread is to die for! I spilled egg all over my eating area but didn't care. It was that good. 

A must stop food place while you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Got to say I saw the line and was about to walk away ! But when I say I thanked god for me waiting man it was soooo good ! I got the signature slut and it was a mashed purée with a egg that cane with fresh toast ! Service was amazing.... but they need to expand in Arizona !"}
{"text":"I Wish they were Bigger!

FOOD: Lots of tastee overeasy eggs. Better than my New York Eggs! Orange Juice is so fresh and the biscuit is soft, warm and tasty.  Its in the Cosmo Hotel upstairs. Its really small so have your friend grab seating before you join the line. Its not like a sit in IHop restaurant or Waffle House, but more like a Buy ur food and pick your own seat service. I loved the food. Best Eggs of my life and I hope they expand. Menu is all about the Eggs."}
{"text":"The line is always long but it moves fast.  They are playing early 00s hip hop songs which I love.  I had the bacon, egg, and cheese and it hit the spot.  MY husband had the cheeseburger   I would go back but after I try other places in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time at Eggslut was in LA! When I found out Eggslut was in Las Vegas Cosmo I was ready to come here and eat! I must say its a unique breakfast place with sandwiches. It's a very small menu so do not expect to look at a variety of breakfast items. I always order the first breakfast item on their menu. $8 for sandwich $5 for orange juice. The line can be very long but I came in around brunch time. The service is great, location is easy to find, and your sandwich is fresh!"}
{"text":"I was dying to eat at Eggslut having checked in out when I was in Las Vegas for work in November. The place is crazy popular so go early and prepare to wait in a short line. The service is fast. You essentially place your order, take a seat at a communal counter, and wait for them to call you name. The name of the game here is eggs, although they do offer a butternut biscuit. 

I was planning to oder the Slut, their signature dish with a cage-free coddles egg, but the chef at Momofuku told me to order the scrambled eggs as he said they were the best he'd ever eaten. That meant I had to order the Fairfax with cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. I added in avocado and elected to get the dish on top of a salad instead of the brioche bun. It's nice they offer option. 

The eggs were unbelievable!! Best scrambled eggs ever. I asked what the secret was and was told, \"lots of butter.\" 

Drinks are very limited and include OJ, Coke, water and drip coffee.

A fun experience and delicious quick breakfast. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got a very tasty bacon and egg sandwich, flavored boldly and served simply and quickly. I'm sure there's often a big line but I went first thing and I was all set."}
{"text":"Offers a creamy sous vide breakfast in jar deconstructed egg sandwich. Inventive and fun!
Also much more affordable than the $$$ buffets in the hotels nearby."}
{"text":"This was alright. It wasn't bad In any way, but it wasn't just oh so fantastic. It was a pretty usual breakfast. The people behind the line were nice."}
{"text":"First, a clarification: I really, really enjoyed the food here and all of their employees were pleasant. Despite that, I can't give Eggslut a 5 or even a 4 -- too many other things irrationally piss me off about this place.

Let's talk about the crown jewel of their menu, the $10 \"Slut.\" The Slut is an egg poached in a jar resting on top of potatoes, all ingredients cooked to a temperature of 142 degrees Fahrenheit in an immersion circulator (think sous vide). The Slut is served with diagonal baguette slices, toasted and buttered, and meant to be mixed in its jar and then scooped onto the toast points. In this way, I'd think of it as a \"breakfast appetizer\" meant to be shared between two people rather than an entrée. Those reading this who have ever had an Onsen Egg (\"hot spring\" egg) at a high-end Japanese restaurant, or even experimented with eggs in your home sous-vide setup know what to expect: a perfectly cooked yolk delicately encased in silky and creamy whites. I sometimes make these eggs at home and eat them with nothing but a light sprinkle of salt. Eggslut amps up this concept, serving the eggs on top of smooth, micro-sieved pommes purée featuring a high ratio of butter to potatoes. The result is a sophisticated and very tasty \"mashed potatoes with gravy\" for breakfast.

The other item I ordered was Eggslut's $15 \"Gaucho Sandwich,\" which consisted of seared Wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, arugula, and an egg over-medium served in a brioche bun. Fully justifying its price-tag, this may be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had. The spicy chimichurri was heavy with fresh cilantro, which balanced out the slightly-bitter arugula very nicely. The steak was beefy, soft and began falling apart in my mouth in anticipation of my next chew. I acknowledge that places like Ruby Tuesday were selling $8.95 \"Kobe\" burgers last decade, which was obvious fraudulent bullshit -- but this truly may actually be real, genuine imported Wagyu beef that Eggslut is serving in their breakfast sandwich.

Here's my main problem with Eggslut: this is a restaurant that is more about ego and brand-building for tomorrow than it is about being a restaurant I want to go to today. Because if it was about being a restaurant I want to go to today, they'd figure out how to deal with the line. I got there at 7:04am on a Monday morning, a mere 4 minutes after they opened, and needed to wait in a 15 minute line. I then waited another 7 minutes for my food. The ownership seems to not understand that this is Las Vegas and that I have options galore. And, yes, I am convinced the line is intentional. They've been open long enough that they could have adjusted their prices, hired additional capacity, or done any number of things to fix this -- but they won't, because of ego. \"Look at me! No one else has a line like this! I must be doing something right!\"

My second problem with this place is that their automated POS asks for a tip (15% 20% etc.) when you pay at the order counter. I entered a tip in out of habit, not realizing that there is no table delivery to speak of. You basically wait around in an area, they call your name, and you grab your grub, no differently than you would at Burger King. No one in their right mind would give a 20% tip at Burger King.

My third problem is that although I don't have an issue with the price of their food items (because they were both really good), I did have a problem with them charging $5 for a cup of orange juice in a fast-casual setting. That's just exploitative and lousy.

So, yeah, great food... but I'm afraid I can't give these people any more of my money until they fundamentally change a few extremely annoying aspects of their business.

Food/Décor/Service: 4.5/3.5/NA"}
{"text":"The line wrapped around the corner near the hidden restrooms when we arrived. It's quite a walk to get here as it's not located on the ground floor of the casino but worth the walk! I was definitely a fan of the Applewood Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich. It had really nice flavors and I definitely stole a few bites from my boyfriends sandwich!!

I wasn't too big of a fan of the sausage turkey sandwich; nothing stood out from the sandwich in terms of flavors or texture. 

Their isn't much seating available but there is always a bench or two you can find throughout the casino to sit or you can grab your breakfast to go."}
{"text":"Hi All!  So this place is pretty good!  My wife had the Fairfax and it was pretty good...not great but good.  Wife added a sausages patty.  It gave it a little more substance. The sandwich bun fell apart when we picked it up....so be careful!!   3.9/5

I had THE SLUT!  It was YUM!!!!!!  If you order this or have had it already you will know what I'm talking about.  You have to spread THE SLUT generously.  It's a lot o creamy goodness!  As you dig deeper into THE SLUT it gets way better. You have to get to the layers at the bottom to really appreciate it.  When u bite into THE SLUT take the time to let the flavors tantalize your pallet.  I'll give this a 5/5

ENJOY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! The line is worth the wait! The people here are friendly and helpful and went over a large order before handing it off to make sure they got it right. The wait actually isn't very long once you actually order. I'm actually not the biggest fan of eggs, but the way they incorporated the eggs into their burgers and other sandwiches were really good. All of the flavors worked really well together and were simply delicious! We came here on a random day of the week and there was still a line. There weren't that many areas to actually sit down and eat so we took our order to go."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic breakfast place. It's totally worth the wait in line. Expect to wait up to 15-20 minutes. These guys make a simple bacon, egg and cheese sandwich taste amazing! The warm cookies are a real treat so they are highly recommended. Patrick is great and very accommodating. Thanks for making the warm cookie happen when we thought you were sold out!"}
{"text":"This place was located right outside not too far from Marquee. We were all pretty tired after the club and wanted to eat something savory. I've heard of this place from so many others and have always wanted to try it for myself! The servers and cashiers were very nice and quick to take our orders. Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes after ordering. I got the cheeseburger and don't regret it one bit! There's something amazing about adding egg to your meal - especially in a burger. The burger wasn't too big considering the price, so I suggest adding another item or getting an appetizer to go along with it. Would definitely eat here again - perhaps at a location that's closer to me than LV."}
{"text":"The line here is nothing compared to the one in LA so this is a plus. The hours are a bit wierd at some times so should always double check before going. The sandwiches are not that bad but its all bout the sluts which is a good appetizer to hold your hunger in if u were planning to eat somewhere filling later."}
{"text":"Cool name? Sure. Lots of hype? Yeah. Good food? Not really.

After hearing a bunch about Eggslut, I decided to give it a shot and was unfortunately disappointed. I had the Fairfax with avocado. While the brioche bun was yummy, the scrambled eggs were actually quite bland which really ruined the sandwich since the avocado and cheese don't provide much flavors on their own either. I was actually enjoying the sausage, egg and cheese until my partner mentioned that it tasted like a glorified Egg McMuffin and I slowly realized they were right. Sure, it was better. But $8 worth of better? Not at all.

Overall really over-hyped. Better breakfast and egg sandwiches can be had elsewhere"}
{"text":"Eggcelent! One of the best breakfast sandwich spots there are. Had the sausage eh and cheese on a biscuit instead of the brioche."}
{"text":"$10.50 for a \"Slut?\" The yoke's on you! Fool me once, shame on me for buying a jar of runny mashed potatoes with one rawish egg in it. I was directed to stir these ingredients into something like a spread, and to use it on the 3 small slices of baguette that made the dish edible.

I can only guess this is some import from France where it might be a hangover cure. As such, I admit it was easy on the stomach, and effective. As breakfast? Never."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place and finally got the opportunity while in Vegas. This location is inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The line was pretty long on a Tuesday afternoon but moved fairly quickly. I ordered a sausage, egg & cheese sandwich which comes on a brioche bun with a freshly squeezed orange juice. It was absolutely amazing! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Highly recommend this quick, yet satisfying breakfast spot! Get there early or quite the line can grow, but they are quick so it moves quickly."}
{"text":"Was a first time customer and it was so delicious that we went back again for seconds the next day. The line looked long, but it goes by pretty fast. We got the slut with bacon ( I didn't know the slut was made with mashed potatoes mixed with the half done egg), the slut was very good but a bit pricey for the small portion ( we ended up $65 for just 4 items). We also got the Wagyu steak burger, that was very very yummy. Definitely recommend trying both of these items."}
{"text":"Overrated with too much hype! Little to no options with veggies, sandwiches have little to no egg and tons of greasy meat and even ketchup??? Ay. The buns are too big and dry yet the line is often around the corner. Date I say I'd rather have an Egg McMuffin?"}
{"text":"This place is always a hit it is located right outside of the Marquee club in the Cosmo. I love the fresh squeezed OJ they have, the slut is a major hit, and the sausage sandwich on the brioche bun. So to describe what the slut actually is since the name sounds a little sketchy lol it is a coddled egg with mashed potatoes garnished with chives that you spread on freshly toasted sour dough slices I promise u although it sounds so simple it is very delicious a for sure must try. The presentation is also interesting because it comes in a small little jar prepped as you order. There are only a few locations so be sure to take advantage while you are in Vegas. Plus after a night out on the town in Vegas it's guaranteed to hit the spot."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a slutty egg sandwich after a night out partying in Vegas?

Nothing! Minus the fact that they up-charge like crazy for these sandwiches compared to their LA location, but I digress.

What really matters here is the accessibility of this Eggslut on the Strip. It's opened very early in the morning and is more affordable than a lot of other brunch spots in these mega hotels. You and your friends will truly see the late nighters coming out for a breakfast sandwich as the line wraps around at all hours of the day.

The sandwich is great for what it is. You got bacon, egg, and cheese all baked between two brioche buns. It got the job done really well and it didn't take long for us to get our food after we ordered.

So is it a welcome addition to the Vegas community? Absolutely, but don't expect it to be mind blowing either. Enjoy it for what its worth- a decent but delicious, slutty sandwich."}
{"text":"Breakfast? Brunch? Hungry? Funny restaurant name? CHECK this place out!
EGGSLUT is an absolute MUST TRY if you're in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas!

SETTING/SERVICE:
Menu is simple and easy to read!
Limited seating but people come and go frequently so seats open up quick!
It's a little pricey for the size of the food, but it's perfect in terms of filling you up and taste!!!
The staff is super friendly and the playlist is fire!!!

FOOD:
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!
The Fairfax is my absolute favorite, the Sriracha Mayo makes the sandwich amazing! The Slut is also their special and it is delicious!!!
*hint* everyone recommends the OJ and it is fresh squeezed and delicious! Try it! 

OVERALL: A+
Eggslut is amazing and the food is spectacular! 
I'm obsessed with this place and plan on coming here as much as I can every time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"After an intense clubbing night at Marquee, my friends and I decided to grab a quick late night snack before heading back to our hotel. Even though I live in LA, I actually never had the opportunity to visit Eggslut and try its menu. Pretty buzzed, I ordered the Slut, which is essentially coddled egg and potato puree in a mason jar with a couple slices of toasted baguette drizzled in olive oil on the side. The aftermath of mixing the egg and potato puree together is a rich and thick mixture that is super flavorful. It acts as a spread you put on top of the crunchy baguette. I'm someone who never really eats midnight snacks, so for me to finish an entire order by myself... I'd say the Slut is pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast during our trip to LV. Heard good things about this place.  It's in the cosmopolitan hotel.  Easy to find after you park. 

Quite crowded.  And glad we came here.  Surely the food did not disappoint.  Ordered a \"slut\" and sausage egg cheese sandwich 

The slut was tasty.  Lightly salted bread dipped into a jar of egg and mashed potato.  Quite innovative and tasty. The sausage egg cheese is like an upscale egg mcmuffin, pretty good too.  You will definitely be fulfilled.   

I recommend getting here early. The line can be long. But overall a decent breakfast experience. Will return if we are in town again."}
{"text":"Went to this place only because it's downstairs. Not a fan of sandwiches but end up finding this one is so tasty. Soft bread and melting scrabbled eggs are so perfect for each other. They should get married in Vegas."}
{"text":"In the words of Mr. Peabody, adequate but hardly extraordinary. 

I did relish placing my order with the cashier, \"I'll have a slut please.\" Too easy, I know. I kept a straight face. After picking it up I found one of the few seats remaining and sat down. Across from me were three rotund black women, all enjoying their own breakfasts as well. The lady in the middle asked me what I was eating? 

\"A slut,\" I answered. 

\"I bet you didn't know you was gonna eat one,\" and she began to laugh. As did I. She had me there. 

Ok, this is fast food done reasonably well. You can ignore all the reviews about it costing too much. Tell me something that doesn't in this town. You come here to have fun; never mind the cost. Having said this, Eggslut might have opted for the small Mason jar instead of the teeny-weenie size. But they are selling plenty of them so don't imagine they will be upsizing anytime soon.  Or maybe a larger jar would require two eggs to get the egg-potato ratio just right. So then charge more (not that I know anything about the restaurant business).

The slut doesn't seem to be mashed potatoes with a soft boiled egg, but rather just potatoes cooked right, puréed, chives and salt added. Potatoes could have been a little warmer. Egg properly coddled. All in all, it was good enough. 

Did also have the biscuits--okay but not perfect. But you might like them. 

Not sure I'd go out of my way for Eggslut, but in the neighborhood? Sure."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie - I'm pretty in love with this place. They don't have a store in NYC and now I'm craving it!

I had the Gaucho - seared wagyu, over medium egg, red onions and arugula. Just reading the ingredients alone have me salivating! I would definitely recommend getting this.
I also got a side salad and orange juice. It was a lot of arugula though since the side salad is all arugula which also comes in the sandwich. 

With almost only crazy expensive options in Vegas, this is a great place to get quality food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"It's all hype! Just another \" hipster\" place that people flock too. I was so unimpressed. The line was curving around the building and I thought I was in for a treat. WRONG! Other than the brioche bun and the \"special\" ketchup in my sandwich it was it was so average. The bun was just way to thick for what I was eating, the bacon was fatty (had to remove a bunch from my sandwich) and the egg was nothing special just an over medium egg. 

The side of butter milk biscuit was so disappointing  in the texture.

We ended up paying $35 dollars for 2 sandwiches a biscuit to split and two iced coffees. 

Pass!! 

Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Definitely think this place is a little hyped up. Don't get me wrong, the items are delicious! Who doesn't love a good egg with perfectly runny yolk? I just find this place to be slightly pricey for what it is. My friends and I ordered several different items and shared everything. The eggs are cooked to perfection as expected, but the burger patties and buns were very mediocre/almost too dry. Most importantly, I was still hungry after finishing a full $10-15 burger, and I'm just a petite 5'2\" girl with a regular healthy appetite.

Verdict - Come give it a try if the line isn't too long, but I'd say one experience is more than enough."}
{"text":"It pains me to do this but...

After coming here a few times (with great experiences) I chose Eggslut for breakfast while having friends in town. We waited in line then when it came our turn to order we should have run for the hills.
I ordered the Gacho sandwich (my favorite) on a salad instead of a bun. When the order came out it was on a bun so I immediately took it to the cashier and she asked me if I wanted it remade. I said yes. So watching them \"remake it\" they slid the meat off onto a bed of lettuce and handed it back to me. The meat was cold by then so I asked if I could get it heated up.. she said \"do you expect us to remake the whole thing?\"

Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order. 
I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm.
Also my friends bacon on his sandwich was so burnt you could pinch it and it fell apart. Completely charred.

Fast forward 5 hours later... food poisoning. I will never return."}
{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!

Perfect wake-up greasy awesome amazing filling necessary freaking cool breakfast for the hangover and Vegas'ing...

Eggslut in LA is good...Eggslut in LV...could it be...yes, it is....BETTER!

Cool location in the Cosmopolitan, on Level 2...lines get long, oh well...it's worth it. I get the Fairfax, added avocado...awesome.

LOVED IT BOOM!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the one in LA. Not sure why... but the Sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich didn't give me the mouthgasm I was expecting when I first tried it at the LA location.

I also got the slut, a coddled egg with mashed potatoes on the bottom and served with 3 slices of bread. This was good but not as creamy as I remembered.. maybe my taste buds were off from a night of drinking? Who knows, but I'd still recommend trying this place out when you're Vegas.  


Definitely a plus that the food came out fast and the lines were moving not to slow."}
{"text":"The slut is amazing!  Creamy delicious potato purée topped with a slow egg and grey salt!  My go to every time in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Can I have eggslut everyday?! Honestly I haven't gone a day without thinking about their delicious sandwiches since I got back from Vegas. My friend and I had Eggslut as one of the top spots on our list of places to try while in Vegas. 

It does tend to get very long lines but rest assured that lines move fairly quickly. My first visit I went with the fairfax sandwich and added avocado. It was DELICIOUS. Possibly one of the greatest breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The eggs weren't over cooked at all and it had tons of flavor. That siracha mayo is bomb! Our second visit I went with the sausage, egg, and cheese in a effort to switch it up. While it was still very good it definitely wasn't as delicious as the fairfax. 

I have been recommending eggslut to anyone I can, so to all of you on yelp who are reading this...I recommend it to you as well!"}
{"text":"We waited in line about an hour at 11 am. The line seemed to move pretty slowly but it could have just been me being hangry LOL.

I ordered the sausage and egg sandwich (they use turkey sausage which is nice) and a coffee. The sandwich was very good, but not sure if it was worth the hour wait. The coffee was AWFUL though. It almost wasn't even warm enough to be lukewarm and it just tasted bad...for $5, I would really like a coffee that didn't taste like 7/11 $1 coffee. 

They also missed my friend's order, but were quick to remedy it even when it was busy so +1 for that. 

I have heard so many good things about Eggslut but from my experience, it was overrated and just okay for the price and wait time."}
{"text":"I'll take two sluts kthxbai. 

Worth the wait. 

Th Fairfax was good but the eggs were a little wet for my liking and it was a little heavy on the Sriracha mayo but it didn't taste bad at all. 

Get the slut jars all day long."}
{"text":"I still don't understand the name....

BUT the Fairfax is delicious! The eggs were just the right amount of cheesy with a kick and on the most delicious brioche bun I've had in a while. However, the line was atrocious! If it wasn't for the wait 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, it was a bit difficult to find.

Fairfax was very good. The regular breakfast sandwich with bacon was okay. They did not skimp on the bacon. 

The line was long and it took about 40 minutes to get food at 9am in the morning. I was glad to have tried the food but the place was overhyped."}
{"text":"I love the slut

always GREAT!! get in here.
only about $3 more than an eggmcmuff!
and 100 times better!"}
{"text":"This place is well worth the wait in line. We only went based on the name and it ended up being the best breakfast we had in Vegas. Everything tasted so fresh, food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on our honeymoon last week. It was so good we came back the next day for more. We tried the Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, the buttermilk biscuit and the slut; everything was delicious! I really wish we had one in Boise, ID. We would eat there all the time."}
{"text":"Staying at the Cosmopolitan, then you have to try this place for their breakfast sandwich.  I got the fried egg, cheddar, turkey sausage sandwich and is was to the McMuffin what Gordon Ramsey's Burgr is to the Quarter Pounder. The sandwich was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have had for about $10. The atmosphere is like Starbucks but OK."}
{"text":"Slut was a disappointment. I was basically eating mash potatoes with bread. However, the fairfax was delicious. One if the best breakfast sandwiches I had."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a fan of egg sandwiches, but I was in Las Vegas staying at the Cosmopolitan, and my girl friend and I decided to check it out. I had the egg salad sandwich and she had the Fairfax. We tried to get some biscuits, but they'd sold out, so we had to get there the next time super early, and let me tell you, those sandwiches and biscuits are LIFE. The egg salad is creamier than I'm used to, and they give you a lot of it, so have napkins on your lap. I went back twice for biscuits, which are as big as your palm. Will definitely be going there again.

Heads up - the line gets long pretty fast, so if you're an early bird, it's best to get there around 7-8am if you want a biscuit. They'll be sold out by 11am. Trust me. They close at 7pm and reopen at midnight, so if you're coming in from a night of partying and want a bite, this is perfect."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this spot and woke-up early to stand in line. There was already a long line at 8 am but it did move fast. I ordered the bacon sandwich and it was just okay. Definitely not worth $8."}
{"text":"Love egg slut! Lines are always super long so be prepared. Great hangover food cure. Love egg slut! Lines are always super long so be prepared. Great hangover food cure."}
{"text":"Good food at a surprisingly good price for Vegas.  Wife had the Slut with a biscuit on the side and immediately said, worth the wait, there was a long line when we for here.  They have it down to a science though, line moves fast.  Fairfax with bacon was my choice and it had a nice kick to it.  Didn't look like a lot of food but I'm full and it's a place I'd hit up again if I was going to hang around."}
{"text":"For my Vegas trip over the weekend, my friends and I stayed really close to the Cosmo, so of course when we found out there was an Eggslut here (I had heard of the LA location), we *had* to come and check it out!

We came for lunch on Sunday and then I came back again by myself right before my early Tuesday morning. But before I get into the food, let's get some details out of the way.

Location: Cosmo is huge, so it's pretty easy to get lost looking for Eggslut. It's closer to the east side of the hotel and grouped together with other restaurants and eateries. It's on the SECOND floor, not the third, and directly across from the main entrance of Marquee (the main club in Cosmo). If you follow signs for either the restaurant area or Marquee, then you should be able to find Eggslut pretty easily.

Hours: This Eggslut has some weird hours, so make sure you check that before going. I noticed over the weekend that they were open Sat and Sun from midnight till 7 pm, so I assumed they would have similar hours throughout the week. But nope, these hours are only for Tuesday (so random!) in addition to Sat/Sun. They close everyday at 7 pm though, so come early if you want to grab dinner here!

Lines: This place is popular, but the lines all really depend on when you come. The first time when we came around 11:15 on a Sunday, we ended up waiting in line for about an hour before it was our turn to order. The second time I came was around 1:30 am on a Tuesday after hitting up Marquee, and at this time there was practically no line. So if you're planning to come at peak lunch times, definitely expect a long wait.

Seating: There is very limited seating within the restaurant area itself. A lot of people either took their orders to go or sat down at the nearby hotel couches to eat. Just keep in mind this is more of a casual dining spot, not a fancy sit down restaurant with full service.

Food: I tried both the sausage and egg sandwich as well as the Fairfax with the sausage addition and thoroughly enjoyed both. The warm brioche bun went along great with the egg and the sausage. My friends all ordered one of the two, and for a while there was zero talking as we were all too busy savoring the deliciousness of the sandwiches. Now that's how you know the food is good! :) 

I also tried the signature side dish, the slut, but I was much less impressed with that. It's essentially a sous vied egg + potato puree served in a glass jar with 3 small baguette slices. After I mixed the sous vied egg and potato puree together in the jar, I could not taste the egg at all, only the potato puree. You're supposed to use it as a spread on the baguette slices, but the puree was too salty and there just wasn't enough baguette slices to go with it. I don't understand how this side dish is so pricey, but I would not recommend unless you really want to give into the hype.

Price: Eggslut definitely is on the pricey side, though I think their sandwiches are worth it. Eight dollars for the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich seems reasonable, especially given Vegas prices. However, the signature dish, the slut, was not worth the $10 I paid for it."}
{"text":"The wait was not long on Monday morning and service was pretty quick, however this location is nowhere comparable to LA. Everything was extremely salty especially the eggslut."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZINGGGGG new favorite place ever!!! i literally crave it!"}
{"text":"This was a great quick stop for food. It is reasonably priced for Vegas but the line is usually pretty long. I had the egg and sausage sandwich with the honey mustard aoli and it was perfect. The egg was cooked medium so there was some yoke that broke but didn't overcome the sandwich."}
{"text":"Long line snakes around corner for brunch but wait time was approximately 20 minutes if you stand in line next to restroom. Seating is a bit limited and offers trendy seats. Just split up to stand in line and look for seats. Got the Gaucho sandwich, which is Wagyu tri-tip steak with an egg on brioche bread and it was AMAZING. One star deducted because meat could be more seasoned but it is tender and not chewy at all. For $15, it's totally filling and worth it!"}
{"text":"I have never thought I would be ok with spending $20 on a breakfast sandwich and orange juice until I came to eggslut. I got fairfax with orange juice and my goodness it is amazing. The combination of soft and chewy buns, creamy and savory eggs with juicy sausage will make you go crazy. I've never had breakfast sandwich with orange juice and it was weird to me that people would eat them together. After having them together at eggslut, I will always pair breakfast sandwich with orange juice"}
{"text":"**$5 Coffee ***

Soooo ... yea .... I bought s breakfast sandwich and coffee which totaled $18. I'm not pleased with myself but what can I say... I crave breakfast and eggs all day. I made my peace by reminding myself the price is similar to SF or Oakland. 

The sandwich was amazing ... savory with a scallion taste. It was quite filling ! Now the coffee ... geesh, can't believe I paid $5 for a 12 oz brew of regularness but when in Vegas ....

All in all it was tasty but I also could've save around $10 and ventured off the strip for an equally tasty croissant sandwich or something :/)"}
{"text":"On our first day in Vegas, we found out that they had Eggslut located in the Cosmopolitan which is right across from where we were staying.  Sooo happy because I've been wanting to try this place.  I knew they had one in LA but no idea there was one in Vegas.  

Upon arriving, there was a pretty long line going down the hallway where the bathrooms are.  The line almost made me want to go somewhere else but what the heck. We're in Vegas and I wanted to see what the hype was all about.  So we probably waited about 15-20 min in line.  Wasn't too bad. But then again, we are waiting for a sandwich. Although it's not just any sandwich.. it's an Eggslut sandwich and I can definitely say I am one.  I love eggs period.  Runny, boiled, poached, scrambled.. I like it all.  Anyways, when we finally got to order, I found out the turkey sausage was out.  So I opted for my second choice which was The Fairfax sandwich.  Our order came out pretty quick.  The problem was not enough tables but we luckily snagged a spot.  We came in a big group so our other friends sat a few tables down from us.

Now for the sandwich.. the brioche bun was definitely the perfect bun to use for an egg sandwich.  My scrambled eggs were a little bit on the runnier/softer side which made it a little hard to eat but still very delicious.  I could taste the sriracha mayo in the sauce but I feel like it was still missing something.  Maybe a little more flavor.  But it was still good nonetheless and surprisingly very filing. 

Overall I'm glad I got to try the place.  I wasn't blown away but it satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but they messed up our order twice and the guy at the register was really rude when we ordered. The guy looked at us really weirdly and rolled his eyes when we asked for sausage on the side and hard eggs. Then when we got our order the first time, it had sausage. When we sent it back, the egg was cooked wrong. Both the guy at the register and the woman who gave us our food seemed very miserable with their jobs and shouldn't be working a customer service job if they can't handle making something to order."}
{"text":"Quick and easy spot to grab a breakfast bite. Got the fairfax sammy + bacon, and it was mmm mmm goood. Pillowy eggs on a soft brioche bun, a lil cheddar and chives, plus that crispy bacon and boom... I was back!

Just don't go during peak breakfast hour or the line will be noodling throughout the hotel."}
{"text":"For all the social media hype and long line, I was expecting a little more flavorful meal. After waiting in line for a good 20 min or so, I ordered their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a gluten-free bun. The turkey sausage was decent and the size was alright, but I think maybe the gluten-free bun killed it. I should've just stuck with the original brioche bun, dang it."}
{"text":"Went to Eggslut at around 11am on the Saturday before Christmas and the wait was only 15-20 minutes! Had the Slut and Fairfax and both amazing. Eggs are fluffy and fresh, will get the Slut again for sure. Make sure you pop the yolk and mix well with the potatoes before dipping in the bread!

Food was so quick, took around 5-10 to get food once ordered. Much much faster than the DTLA location but quality and taste the same (and awesome)."}
{"text":"30 min wait at 9:30am on a Wednesday... got the slut and fairfax (and added avocado). The fairfax has more flavors - soft and perfectly scrambled eggs with the flavors of the sauces on a scrumptious bun. The slut comes in a jar which makes it more fun to eat but was more monotone compared to the fairfax. Either choice is good depending on what you want"}
{"text":"Long line but worth the wait! The staff is so sweet too. I got the Fairfax sandwich and basically swallowed it whole lol. It was filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go to for breakfast. I knew that the food was worth the wait when I saw the line wrap AROUND the store. Slut is a must order when you come here because it's so delicious and unique . I am a huge fan of Eggs and I'm so glad that I found that spot. I recommend anyone that wants an amazing breakfast to come try out this spot . Will definitely return in the near future !"}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to say although I consider myself a foodie, I've never even heard of this place until it was time for one last meal in Vegas before heading home! I guess it's probably because I can make a pretty mean breakfast on my own at home already, so I tend not to eat our for breakfast or brunch as much.

Anyway, we made our way upstairs only to find a long line wrapping around the wall. Let me tell you people, the wait IS SO WORTH IT. I had the fairfax + avo + arugula with chimichuri on the side (so good!). It was a 45 min wait from the moment we went in line until the moment I heard the staff's voices call out my name that our order was finally ready! Seriously good breakfast sandwich. I think the soft and crispy brioche bread just makes it. I was told they have a location in Venice in LA also by our neighbors on the communal table."}
{"text":"I only ordered _*SLUT (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette.) It was so delicious and not so heavy. If you are hungry, you need to take 2 order because it's a small jar. The location is Inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In the third floor, just take the escalator form the casino."}
{"text":"Masterfully Messy & Marvelous honey. Service from Marlon was Fan-EFFin-Tastic, Believe the hype Egg Slut will seduce you.

Ciao"}
{"text":"For late night drunk food or as hangover food, Eggslut provides that perfect amount of greasy-ness, carb, and protein to satisfy that alcohol induced hunger! It's a must try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Cosmopolitan I had a \"Slut\" each day for 5 days in a row.    \"Slut\" and biscuit perfect combo.  The perfect biscuit as a side to your Slut.  Butter and dip it in the amazing pure maple syrup. Before the big stir and after.  I absolutely love this place.  They open  at 7am weekdays.  But on the weekends they open at midnight.   It's worth every Penny."}
{"text":"Too small. This little place is on the 2nd floor inside the Cosmopolitan. We went on a Sunday at 0930. The line was about 50 people deep. There was only 1 register working, and about 30 seats. The seating was diner style, and not through individual tables. It's not worth the wait unless you are staying in this hotel and don't want to venture out."}
{"text":"You could do better for the price. The egg in the signature \"slut\" is good, but most of what you're eating is going to be mashed potatoes.

The meal overall was quite simple, and not in a particularly good way for $15 a person. You're in Vegas, even if it's 3 am you have better options nearby."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't get the hype. This Cali chain has landed, after much anticipation, on the Vegas Strip in the Cosmopolitan. Sure, it was opening day and they were super busy...30 minute line turned into more of an hour wait because one of the employees messd up a sandwich and had to recreate it; backing up the many orders behind. And the manager just stood there with dear in highlights look. Step in and help the guy out DA! My 3 star rating is not due to the wait or less than stellar service. Day 1 = I'm am a reasonable person after all. ;)

3 stars based solely on food quality, creativeness (lack thereof), and cost. Frankly speaking, the most intriguing thing I found about Eggslut was the interesting name - very befitting for Sin City! 

Their signature \"Slut\" that's cooked and served in a small jar (think maybe twice the size of a baby food one) in water bath sounded very promising, and I liked the fact you get to keep the cute little jar and lid. Could start a collection. Lol. The dish is simply pureed potates, with one egg on top, garnished with chives, \"gravy salt\" (which I think they forgot) served with a few pieces of EVOO drizzled toasted baguette slices. The egg was completely overcooked - no yolky goodness - and the potatoes were bland. It wasn't horrible, but it's not something I would call phenomenal...by far. It lacked any form of texture (very thankful for the bread) and tasted...well...like baby breakfast food. I bet kids love the \"Slut!\"

In addition, they must be making a killing on markup of packaging and product. Sells the \"Slut\" for $10; probably costs them less than 2 bucks to create. Great business model at least...and they do seem to have an obsessive fan base. Anybody want to go in on a franchise? :P

Next time I feel like eating some slutty cuisine,  I'll just cook naked at home with the windows open...no fried foods of course. Happy noshing!

NOTE: The space is really small and has very little counter seating on one wall. There are seating areas scattered close by in the Cosmo though."}
{"text":"Love the branding. I tried the slut and while very unique I found it so salty!!

Line usually wraps around the corner and down the hall.  The guy taking orders kept the line moving and then it really stalled out waiting for our food. Turns out our ticket got skipped. 

While not the best experience I'd probably still recommend it and maybe try a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here 2 of the 3 days we were in town. One of my colleagues also had dinner here one of the evenings.

My favorite was fairfax; the eggs were scrambled beautifully. 

Coffee was average."}
{"text":"Eggslut is amazing... I had the gaucho after a long night of drinking and dancing, and it was heaven in my mouth.  We are here for a bachelorette party, and all the girls were raving about the food.  I'm standing in line as I write this review and noticed it's mostly negative people who review things, so I wanted to give it a positive perspective - if you want some deliciousness in your mouth, eat at Eggslut."}
{"text":"I'd visited the original Eggslut in LA's Grand Central Market on a few different occasions, and found it bland and overrated every single time.  When a friend insisted we visit its latest incarnation in the Cosmo, I was skeptical.

Turns out my skepticism was justified.

The food is essentially identical to what's served at the LA occasion, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  After a long-ish (30 min) wait to order on a Thursday morning, I quickly received my egg salad sandwich and took a seat at the neighboring Chandelier bar to chow down.  Unfortunately, the sandwich was decidedly average.

My gripe with Eggslut food transcends all of the locations, and it's the blandness.  The egg salad sandwich was undoubtedly fresh and high-quality, but it tasted like nothing.  Any seasoning at all would've made the sandwich better.  Some salt, maybe?  A little pepper?  Maybe go crazy and add some heat or acidity?  I realize the goal is to make the eggs the star, but eggs are pretty basic, flavor-wise.  They need seasoning, and they need it desperately.

I also had a cold brew coffee.  It was very good and strong -- markedly better than the cold brews at most of the casino cafes.

But the cold brew couldn't rescue the experience.  Until Eggslut starts giving its food some flavor, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"So really wondered what the hype was about for a breakfast place that does eggs and after waiting in a reasonably sized line for breakfast I get it and I agree that this place is delicious. Got the egg slut, fairfax, and the basic egg bacon sandwich to share. The slut was delicous combo of mashed potato and egg on the crostini. The fairfax had really well cooked scrambled eggs on the bun. The sandwich for the price was really good. For a solid breakfast in las vegas that wont cost too much this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite breakfast place in Vegas BUT I love egg sandwiches so a little bias here. One drawback is little to no seating. If you're planning to stay at Cosmo and take up to the room, then you're cool. Don't pass this place up. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but very limited options.  I had the Gaucho. Be warned that there is a lot of bread on all of their sandwiches and the runny egg makes it very difficult to eat.  I suggest getting the egg cooked over hard or over medium.  Coffee was good, but be warned the drinks are expensive... Water cost four dollars.  This place was far too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I was very excited about finally trying Eggslut. We waited in the 30+ minute line for this experience. However, as soon as I was next in line to order, 3 guys walked up and cut the line. Patrick, the manager, allowed this and said it was fine because they \"called ahead,\" yet still placed their order on the spot. It was incredibly disrespectful to all of us who had been waiting in line that these guys somehow got preferential treatment. I will not be coming back.

And my sandwich was only okay."}
{"text":"We stopped by Eggslut for breakfast this morning and I was so impressed by how they went above and beyond to accommodate my husband's gluten allergy. The food was amazing! We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I would definitely suggest going to Eggslut if you are going to Vegas!  My husband I got their early around 8-8:30 and there were only a couple people in line.  As we sat there eating our food the line kept getting longer and longer so I would suggest getting there early if you don't feel like waiting.  They are pretty quick so the line moves fast.  I got the bacon, egg and cheese and my husband got the sausage egg and cheese.  The sandwiches were delicious!! We also both got the fresh squeeze orange juice which I wasn't a huge fan of but my husband really liked it.  Eggslut is a must try if you are going to Vegas and in need of breakfast!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place during a very early (and rare) morning walk through the Cosmo.  I got the Gaucho-  ive never had a breakfast quite like this.  It was excellent.  My friend simply got the bacon egg and cheese.  Very very good.  If you are a breakfast buff and love this meal you have to try this place at some point.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It was a good sandwich. I got the turkey sausage egg and cheddar. It wasn't worth $8.50 and a 30 minute wait.  But it was good"}
{"text":"Line was ridiculous! And a bit pricey for small sandwiches but what else is new in Vegas. Not enough seating for the rush hour. But the food was good for what it was. And the orange juice was super sweet!"}
{"text":"If your in a hurry and want a quick delicious and very affordable breakfast this is the spot!
The egg sandwich was packed with flavor and I was impressed by the over all theme, branding, and unique idea of this restaurant.  I wish we had one where I live!  Don't let the line steer you away it goes very fast!"}
{"text":"Best bacon egg cheese sandwich in history.  Get in early, lines all day at both the Vegas and DTLA locations."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazingggg. I got the fair fax sandwich.. twice. Also tried the slut. Everything is so flavorful and cooked perfectly. Went with a group of people and everyone loved what they ordered. Don't let the line turn you away, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Get the Slut. It's incredible. Prepare for a line though. It's always busy but I think it's worth it. The line moves pretty quickly as well. 

My friends and I loved it so much that we got two orders. It's simply the best. I'm an egg + mashed potato + toast lover. It's like this dish was made for me! Yummm."}
{"text":"The eggslut here is not bad. It tastes similar to the one L.A. over all it is still good. The one in Vegas is inside cosmopolitan hotel. 2nd floor near Holstein restaurant. Customer service here is pretty good. More seats here then the one in L.A"}
{"text":"Really good food- high quality and quick! So popular we stood in line for a while and it seems a lot of people take it to-go because seating is limited.

I know it's Vegas but 4.50 for a small coffee was a little too much!"}
{"text":"I was told that this place was amazing, however I thought it was overrated. There was of course a super long line and I waited bc my bf really wanted to try it out. It was good, but it wasn't worth the wait. The staff is super friendly so I'll give them that. I wouldn't go back that's for sure.  For an over priced egg sandwich that took way too long, no thanks. I'll take my chances elsewhere. The only reason it has such a hype is bc it's on the strip in the cosmo."}
{"text":"After a night of dancing and drinking, we stopped by for a bite. I had the slut and it was delicious! Smooth and creamy egg with chives on toasted bread, so rich with flavor. Definitely a place to stop by and try."}
{"text":"4 in the morning and famished beyond belief, I was awaiting a warm cooked meal (or snack) to satiate my immense hunger after a full night of clubbing. Respectively, there are quite a few places open late but we came across Egg Slut in the Cosmopolitan while walking back to our hotel and needless to say it did satisfy but there were two items ordered and one was a hit, the other a miss.

Hit: I ordered the \"Slut\" and it was a potato porridge with egg all cooked together in a little mason jar. Yes, I would like to specify that the jar was indeed small because I finished it in six whole bites (but this is a minor gluttonous issue I have that would be useful for some and unhelpful for many). In any case, I really like this! It was really hearty and warm -- perfect for a cold walk through the strip.

Miss: My boyfriend had ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit that Egg Slut is known for and he was thoroughly disappointed. Honestly, he didn't even finish it and left it half-eaten in the tray. He referred to it being very dry and that was the losing point for it all."}
{"text":"Always a favorite of mine, I have to go whenever I see one. 
My personal favorite is \"the slut\", my only complaint about it, is that it is very small. I don't really like bread so it could be due to the fact that I only eat what's in the jar without the given bread crisps."}
{"text":"Loved it.  We didn't want a heavy \"sit-down\" breakfast.  Loved their options, and love the salad on the side.  Great food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very good! Good enough to stand in line and break a carb fast for... even though they will sub arugula for bread. I tried the Slut and it was so good! Its such a different concept and it totally works. I also tried the Gaucho, the brioche bun is fluffy and so good, the sauce gives a delicious kick. I recommend trying this place out for sure! Service was great- the guy behind the counter was even nice enough to carry part of my order out to a seat for me cause my hands were full. That was above what I expected. TRY! The breakfast sandwiches are affordable, too."}
{"text":"Made the one mile walk along the strip to eat here for breakfast. Just like anything else in Vegas, it's overpriced but he food is good.  2 egg sandwiches with and orange juice was almost $30.  Everything is made fresh. It's located in a very fancy hotel/casino. This place is BUSY! Get there early or you'll be stuck in line forever!"}
{"text":"I had the OG Eggslut in LA multiple times and this taste pretty consistent to the LA location. I got my go to egg/bacon/cheese with the ketchup sauce on the side that I never got with my order. They also don't give out water cups and you have to buy a bottle of water - I guess I can't expect too much it's Vegas. The bacon was crispy and salty and the egg was cooked right so no complaint on the quality. The service was meh - the cashier girl did not really listen to our orders and seemed like she hated her job.

Overall
Taste: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Price: 3/5 extremely over priced
Parking: 3/5 hotel parking"}
{"text":"Excellent, very good food.  We had the sausage egg sandwich and the slut.  The slut was good, but a pretty small portion for the price.  The sandwich was nice and hot off the grill, the bun was very good."}
{"text":"Obviously amazing. Get The Slut. Just be prepared to wait in line for at least 20min.

They can also sub-out to help create vege items. I prefer the LA location but this does the trick!"}
{"text":"I waited a good 30 minutes on a Saturday morning for a Fairfax sandwich. After interacting with the very busy, friendly and efficient cashier and getting my sandwich, I easily would have waited another 30.

Don't be alarmed by the line that snakes back to the bathroom. It does move quickly and is worth it."}
{"text":"So good! Great place for breakfast. There was a line but it moved very quickly. The staff seems to be pretty efficient in the back to make order completed quickly! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place!!! There was a bit of a line, but well worth it. We decided to get the sausage sandwich and the biscuit side as well as the slut. It was so yummy and the staff was so helpful and nice. The seating area is small so if it's busy then you might not get a seat. Otherwise everything else was awesome and I will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this LA transplant in Vegas! I would even dare say that this location is just as good or is even better than their DTLA spot! The best part about this location is that if you come during down times, there will not be a wait at all! I stopped by around 2pm on a weekday, and there was no one in line! 

I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese (~$9). I waited a few minutes for my order as they cook it fresh. The sandwich was hot and melt in your mouth delicious with the cheese oozing out. I'm a big fan of brioche, and their brioche bun was perfectly soft with a little bit of a chewy outside crust! If you're really hungry, one sandwich might not be enough so maybe get another sandwich or their signature slut! 

When I'm back in Vegas and won't be making my way down to LA after, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"An excellent egg bacon and cheese sandwich. The ketchup is a strange twist, but works quite well with the delicious bacon. It's probably the first time in Vegas that I felt the size of the sandwich was too small. The problem is the line to order was 30+ minutes at 10am on Friday."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a night out.  With a name like this, how can you not check it out?

I had never heard of this before and was staying at Paris and saw it was close by.  I was expecting a long wait but was able to order and get food quickly.  We both ordered the cheeseburger - very good, nice bun, good greasy food!

It is right by the Chandelier bar, which is beautiful, so you get to check that out as well."}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast sandwiches, but not necessarily something that would keep me in line for 30 minutes again. We had seen their LA location in the Grand Central Market, but the wait there was probably even more crazy! With nothing specific on the agenda for our morning in Vegas, we decided to take the plunge.

For our first trip, we decided to stick with the sandwiches. The breakfast sandwich is a staple of morning life back home in NY, so we always jump at the chance to get a good one. Paired with their fresh orange juice, it made for a tasty breakfast.

Be aware that the food is a little bit pricey for what is essentially \"fast food\" (although it is Vegas!). And the egg sandwiches can be VERY drippy. We didn't realize what we were getting into until the table and our hands were drenched in egg. It definitely helps the sandwich avoid being too dry, but it can also be a bit sloppy."}
{"text":"Eh.  Nothing to rave about.  Certainly not worth 1 hour wait.  The menu is limited with sides.  The egg sandwich is good though.  They need t o expand the site or do something to handle the flow.  Doesn't really have seating either."}
{"text":"what in the world do you put in the \"slut\" to make it taste so delicious?  it's a basic \"soft poached\" egg on top of the softest bed of puree potatoes you'll ever eat in your life.  yes it's a bit pricey, yes you won't understand what in the world you just ate & yes you'll leave thinking about the slut for the rest of your life.  

we also tried sausage, egg & cheese sandwich.  so.friggin.delicious.  the brioche bread was perfectly soft and this is coming from a bread snob.  get your butt in line and let eggslut be your hangover cure."}
{"text":"Great place for good food at any time of the day. If you get the Slut def ask for more bread. If I ever find myself in the area, I will be stopping by for more."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what the hype was about, I got the fairfax and it wasn't even all that. My eggs were salty as heck & all my cheese was melted on to the wrap they wrapped it in. The noise level here is so loud the lady was screaming out people's names. Also, there isn't much seating area... Two stars cause my food was hot."}
{"text":"I ate here after a night at the casino with my friends. We all ordered the cheese burger with avocado and bacon it was so good I actually ate the whole burger. The line to get food was pretty long even though it was 6am you would think that it wouldnt be that busy. I wished they had French fries or something they didn't have anything to go with the burger which was kind of a disappointment I feel like when you order a burger you need fries too. If I ever go back to the cosmopolitan I will definitely have to eat here again it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Eggslut is an addiction! There is always a huge line for this placed! Would recommend coming before they open to wait ahead. Their sandwich is so delicious! What's unique about eggslut is their signature 'slut' which is caged free bird poached in a jar. It's seriously a different concept and I've never seen or taste anything like it. 

For their 'sluts' in the jar you have to mix it up well and then you dip the bread into the jar. It taste like potatoes, but very delicious."}
{"text":"That egg in the cup deal was life changing. The other sandwiches were all very good. Yes, I did order one of everything to take back to the room for the family. Got there at like 6:30am so there was no wait. Makes me want to go to Vegas right now actually."}
{"text":"Long line but definitely worth the wait. I ate The Slut and I'm drooling. We will be back next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Ummmmmm.... mixed feelings, yes Eggslut and their sandwiches are good, however when I thought about it I'm standing in line for a while for literally standard breakfast sandwiches. My boyfriend probably paid around $30 from what I recall for 2 people. For that price I'd much rather prefer a sit down brunch restaurant, which we'd probably pay for cheaper. But I mean you get what you get for a food specialty place especially located on the strip. This place was good, nothing out of this world. Overhyped? Very. But Being a vegas local I didnt expect anymore or any less. Probably wouldn't go back unless a good friend of family is in town and staying at cosmo. That is the only occasion I would come here again. I could make this at home now that I think of it, probably going to rn."}
{"text":"Eggslut-A bun filled with bacon and an over easy egg! The bun was delicious, yet definitely way too expensive! $10+ each."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not super gung-ho about the name, but the food is top notch. 

I've been trying to get signature food when I go to new eateries and why not get \"The Slut\" when you're eating at Eggslut? The description didn't even make it sound all that great, but let me tell ya, this was delicious. It's basically mashed potatoes with an egg on top salted and buttered perfectly. You can spread it on the toasted baguette pieces or just eat it straight. It was so good that The Wife and I went back a second time the next day.

Do it. You won't regret it. Seating is a bit limited but don't let that deter you. The line moves pretty fast as well."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. 
I visited Eggslut twice in the last month and enjoyed my experience each time. The staff is friendly and attentive and the wait, even with a line, is not long. 

The location inside of the Cosmo is well decorated and the furniture perfectly serves the location. This restaurant would more than likely be successful off the Strip as well because the the name recognition and good food. The prices were inflated because of the Strip crowd but that is to be expected. 

Hidden gem of a menu item is the biscuit with honey butter. A great compliment to any order."}
{"text":"Get the slut and shove it in your mouth!  That just sounds dirty, but your mouth will be satisfied!

The slut usually isn't enough to fill me up, so another sandwich is needed.  Go with the steak and egg option, you'll thank me later!

The line usually wraps around to the bathrooms, from there is about 20 minutes to order.  Food comes out usually 10 minutes after ordering.  

If you have a group with you, have someone get some fruity pebble cereal soft serve from Milk around the corner while waiting!

Its that fancy breakfast for the gram!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com!! Definitely need to try it! Bacon egg and cheese was an A+ & sausage egg and cheese was an A also!! \"This was bomb, as a breakfast sand which\"- friend said, def a good place to go to"}
{"text":"Yummy! Very popular breakfast spot, it was busy but the line went fast . Had the fair fax breakfast sandwich with avocado on the side, was really good."}
{"text":"We decided to wait in line which took forever! The cashier was chatting it up with the group in front of us even though the line was insane. The food was good though. I got the slut...it was salty but I like salty. They definitely need to give you more baguette slices. I would totally visit again but only if the line is short."}
{"text":"Got the Fairfax. Good but not great. Maybe some do the best scrambled eggs I ever had. Super soft and fluffy. But the rest of the sandwich was a bit on the lukewarm side?
Maybe it was the fact that I got there close to closing time. Not sure.

The other problem is that since it's loose-scrambled eggs and not omelette style, they keep falling out of the sandwich.

For these prices don't want any weak links on the chain, or the sandwich."}
{"text":"I was surprised how crowded it was on a random Thursday. There were maybe 10 people in line ahead of us. Fortunately, the line moves fairly quickly. The chooses are a few egg sandwiches and their signature offering, the eggslut. I opted for the egg, cheddar and bacon sandwich on their brioche bun. There were almost as many workers as diners, which was impressive. With that many people, one might reasonably expect that the sandwich would arrive hot, but sadly this was not the case. A cold egg bacon and cheese thing is not to be envied. I'm not really sure how that even happens, considering how many folks were there and how fast they were serving the food. On top of that, it featured a chipotle ketchup, a thing I found neither necessary, nor a value add. I enjoyed he experience, but would not rush back. Oh, the freshly squeezed OJ was wonderful."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, the line sucks! But the food was good. The iced coffee was ehh... Let's just say I didn't even finish it and for me to not finish coffee is rare."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place for breakfast.   The menu is just different from other places.  You gotta try the \"slut\" as it was fantastic along with the gaucho.  Both were amazing.   Plus you won't go broke eating here.  Place is super tiny and get there early as the line gets super long later in the morning."}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwich. Had the sausage one. Was perfect for a quick breakfast when at Cosmo. Lines on the weekends are nuts. So give yourself plenty of time"}
{"text":"This place served real food at 4am which was awesome. After a night of drinking and clubbing I was super hungry. There was no line and food was ready in 10 minutes. I ordered the fairfax (basically eggs and cheese and arugula) and it was carby and buttery and eggy and altogether very tasty. The coffee was a bit underwhelming though, not worth the price."}
{"text":"Everybody loves a slut! ;-) 

Lol, but no seriously this place is good. Whoever thought of the slut is a breakfast genius. The slut is simple and yet delicious concoction of heaven in a glass jar. It has this creamy, buttery mashed potato puree at the bottom, with a poached style egg baked on top. Nothing fancy, but just awesome and tasty. I have also had the breakfast sandwich here and that too was good, but I keep returning for yet another slut. 

There has been a bit of a line every time I've come, but this place is worth the wait. You will thank me later. There is seating available, and I haven't had any difficulty finding a place to sit. The place is cute, I love the name, the food is great and creative, the prices aren't bad, and the workers all tend to be friendly. Good spot and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, second floor above the casino.

The wait on a Sunday morning around 10AM for a sandwich is RIDICULOUS. It was approximately a 25-30 min wait, where the line wrapped around the corner and into the hall leading to the restrooms. I expected a little wait based on previous reviews but when the hubs and I got there, there was only 1 person at the register taking orders yet there are 2 registers. The manager was busy refilling napkin dispensers and putting napkins on plates. You've got to be kidding me. 

Limited seating, you'll have to keep an eagle eye out for when someone finishes up to cop a spot. I got the bacon egg and cheese ($8) and the hubs got the cheeseburger ($10). Was it a delicious egg sandwich? Yes. Was it worthy of a name like eggslut? Yes. Was it worth the wait? Maybe. It was my first time eating at eggslut so I was willing to wait but now I've had it, Eh maybe."}
{"text":"When you arrive you will notice a waiting line that goes down a hallway. Do not turn away, it moves fast. The food was very good. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a lot of options on the menu so this place is not for the picky. It is inside my favorite hotel on the strip, The Cosmopolitan. Be prepared to wait an hour and I would love to say its worth the wait but that's just too long to stand in line for food. If you get there early in the morning maybe you can beat the rush. I got the slut and its on the small side for portion size. So for the price you do not get a lot of food here. After waiting so long I was pretty hungry so it did not meet my needs."}
{"text":"You want to start your day right? Definitely a good place to choose. If you love eggs, you will enjoy this place. It's always pretty busy and it's obvious why. Simply, they make a bacon egg and cheese the way it should be. Biscuits are really good, too."}
{"text":"Had the Sausage, Egg & Cheese sandwich and Buttermilk Biscuit. The brioche bun was too greasy for me. The sausage lacked flavor and the honey mustard aioli was an odd mix of sweet and savory. The biscuit tasted like raw flour. Given all the rave reviews I'm willing to try it one more time however, it is low on my list."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Line was long but moved fast. Everything we ordered came out fast and was fresh. Ask for extra baguette with the slut. They don't have complementary waters just over priced bottled water, coffee and juice so pick something up to drink from the news stores before ordering. Seating area is mostly stools and 2 people tables. It was a fun stop food was buttery."}
{"text":"Everyone was talking about Eggslut coming to the Cosmopolitan & I was looking forward to trying it out.

My boyfriend & I went on a weekday around 11 a.m. when it first opened & the line wrapped around.

I don't go to the Cosmopolitan often, but I have been recently & saw it's never as busy as it was when it first opened.

We ordered the most expensive sandwich on the menu & we didn't see what was so great about it. However, their salted chocolate chip cookie is amazing. We wouldn't go all the way to the Cosmopolitan for it though.

Overall, it was not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Waiting in line was not terrible. Long line, quick service so the line moved along quickly! sandwich, flavors were good, but nothing amazing. Got the fairfax with turkey sausage & oj. Spendy for walk thru counter service. $11.50 sandwich, $5 OJ, $4 bottled water. But it is in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas, overpriced food & drink is to be expected."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive, but hey, that's what you get for being on the strip. Came here at 11am and there was a line that wrapped around the corner. It took about 15min to place our order and then another 10-15 to get it. 
Sausage egg and cheese: it was alright, I liked the bun and egg, but the sausage patty itself wasn't anything special.
Gaucho: get it!! It's pricey, but I love the flavors in there.
Slut: if you like mashed potatoes and don't mind mushy baby food texture, get it!! It's like eating comfort food in a jar. Perfectly cooked toast to go with it. 
OJ: save your $$$, not worth the $5
Overall, if I'm in Cosmo, I'd get eggslut again. Nothing I would go all the way to the strip for though 
Next time I come back, I'd give the sandwich with the scrambled egg and caramelized onions a try."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes in line to order our food. It was 4 dollars for 2 pieces of bacon. The food is just alright nothing that stood out to me. I had the slut that came in the smallest mason jar ever with potato purée at the bottom and a coddled egg on top with 3 pieces of crostini for 10 dollars...... obviously that doesn't fill you up. It was more of a snack breakfast place. My boyfriend had and egg sandwich which he wasn't impressed with either. $5 dollars for orange juice is absolutely ridiculous. And for a $30 dollar meal you should at least feel satisfied after. I'm genuinely surprised most people love it so much... it's honestly nothing I couldn't make at home. Maybe I'm just spoiled with the food that I work with at my job but I was definitely not impressed what so ever. There was no sides besides salad... for breakfast?? No thanks. I will definitely not be back for a 25 minute wait and $30 dollar snack"}
{"text":"A place that specializes in eggs does in fact cook the eggs perfectly. The Slut is silky mashed potatoes in a jar with something like a poached egg on top, which makes the most amazing gravy. I could eat it everyday. Dark chocolate chip cookie was so yummy that I shoved it in after being stuffed."}
{"text":"EggSlut was a hit in Los Angeles and now it's in Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas!!!! 
I actually have passed by EggSlut in LA on many occasions but I never bothered to visit it because I heard it was super over hyped and over priced. 
I was pleasantly surprised to see EggSlut in Cosmo and being the egg lover I am I had to give this place a try! (It also helped because there was no line at the time we went). We ordered at the front and our food came out pretty quickly, which I appreciate!

I highly recommend the
The SLUT! - 5/5! Get the Slut if you love a potato and egg. It's a savory velvety goodness of potato puree with perfectly soft boiled egg on top that you spread all over their toasted baguette. 
I honestly never ever have had anything like it and I have no idea how I could even ever make it so it was a 5 star experience for me."}
{"text":"Eggslut lives up to the hype! I always make a point to stop by whenever I'm in Las Vegas and it is worth it every time!

I've tried their bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and fairfax sandwich. I was not impressed with the bacon, egg and cheese, but the fairfax (with added bacon) was absolutely AMAZING. It is hands down, my #1 recommendation! Their cage-free eggs were scrambled to perfection - incredibly soft and super fluffy. Their sriracha mayo complemented the sandwich very well and added a great depth of flavor. I also loved their warm brioche bun! 

The long lines are there for a reason. If you're ever in town, Eggslut is a must - it's SO good!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich here is the Fairfax. The Slut, which is a coddled egg served over potatoes in a glass jar, is also delicious. The eggs are cooked perfectly and the branding is almost as awesome as the food itself.

You will wait in line and I don't know if it's worth it because that's a personal question you have to ask yourself--how long would you wait in line for a fast-casual egg sandwich? It sounds like a lot of suckers on Yelp don't believe the hype as much has I do, but I also love fast-casual and egg sandwiches.

The coffee is delicious but expensive. I was initially upset that I bought such an expensive iced coffee until they told me that I could get a free refill.

My favorite places are these places."}
{"text":"Overpriced trendy crap! Went to McDonalds and got a better egg sandwich at 1/3 the price! Don't even get me started about the drink prices...."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The line is long but moved quickly. We ordered the fairfax and gaucho sandwiches... for egg sandwiches they were alright. Would I come back? Probably not. Eggslut feels like an overpriced fast food place. I would prefer going to a cheaper fast food or go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes, the lines are long and the prices high, but nothing was going to stop me from checking out the very hyped Eggslut.  I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich for $8.50 and I enjoyed every single bite.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE being surprised by a breakfast item that I have never had before! Not only that, but to have something so decadently flavorful, almost mind blowing! No wonder this unique dish is named after the eatery itself, Eggslut. A petite glass jar filled with a savory potato purée and poached egg, topped with grey sea salt and minced chives. Served with perfectly toasted baguette (ask for extra!), this dish elevates breakfast to a whole new level. 

You will find Eggslut across Marquee night club in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We are so excited to have this most welcomed addition to our favorite Vegas resort which we stay at 4-5 times a year. As I write this review I am already salivating for my next delicious jar tomorrow morning, or perhaps late tonight ;-)

Also noteworthy, orange juice is freshly squeezed (love), bacon is thin, crispy and slightly peppered. Egg sandwiches were really tasty, but I highly recommend their specialty. Service is friendly and accommodating, so don't be deterred by the long line (moves fairly quick). It's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious egg sandwiches, full of flavor and on a tasty, fluffy brioche bun. The long lines overwhelmed me initially, but it moved quick. They have an efficient process to cook and assemble sandwiches and trendy to go packaging. I had the fairfax with avocado, yummy! Orange juice was really good and fresh with a little pulp. Also tried the slut - a mix of coddled egg and potato purée, it was my first time trying this type of dish and I liked it, except it was very salty. An order comes with a few baguette slices, so I asked for extra bread. Limited seating here, but we found an open spot by the chandelier bar to eat."}
{"text":"I feel like I like this location better than the LA one (but at the same time I was drunk so not too sure).
The line was longgggg but not as long as secret pizza so we decided to just get food here instead. The sammiches come out so hot that I burned myself taking the first bite. 
Sammiches were delicious!"}
{"text":"The eggslut, something akin to coddled egg over mashed potato is a great concept. The execution of it on my visit didn't quite arrive as advertised.
The egg was cooked perfectly well. I had to maneuver my way back to the cook station for salt and pepper. The chives and salt were missing from my order, salt and pepper were not on the tables. ??? Eggslut is a really busy place so I wasn't too happy working my way back through the crowd.
The mashed potato:good flavor if watery.
The fresh orange juice didn't taste fresh. I said to my companion that the flavor was exactly the same as a well-known frozen orange juice concentrate. ???
My friend liked her Gaucho Sandwich order.

I'd definitely go again. Next time I'll double check my order before sitting down to enjoy breakfast.

4 stars for the concept, up vibe, great people-loving staff. Short on execution and price."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a light and flavorful breakfast, you MUST come here. Even though it looks small, it's the perfect portion.  I ordered their specialty called the SLUT: cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. It was delicious, flavorful and just the perfect size. Yummy. It was very hot and seemed fresh made to order. I also ordered the buttermilk biscuit: house-made biscuit served with butter & maple syrup.  The biscuit was average and the butter was sweet (my kind of butter).

Eggslut seems like a very busy place regardless of their location because I've seen the line at the location in Downtown LA. This Eggslut location is inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. We got here around 11:00 am, there was a huge line, I'd say 20-30 minutes of a wait, so we left.  I really wanted to try it so we made sure we came back to our hotel at 3:00 pm, an hour before they closed. 

This is a counter service style restaurant so....Unless you have no itinerary and are willing to stand in a long line, you probably should. If you don't want to wait, I suggest you do what I did and come right when it opens or before they close. I loved it and I can't wait to try other stuff on their menu, most likel the \"Fairfax\" or the \"Gaucho.\"

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype behind this place. Pretty simple menu but presented in a very unique way. The Fairfax sandwich was great and the signature slut was so creative yet so simple. Really hit the spot and was very nostalgic of childhood days sipping soldiers into a soft boiled yolk. Prepare yourself for a decent wait so worth getting a coffee from Milk Bar around the corner before joining the line"}
{"text":"This was a delicious breakfast sandwich. There was a line, but it moved very fast.  Easy to find in the Cosmopolitan, which isnt true of all restaurants inside casinos in LV.  I had the bacon sandwich and loved it.  My sister enjoyed the sausage one. She did not care for the meat used. I think it was flavored with sage, which was over powering, but otherwise, yummy.  Did not try the slut itself, but it looked odd and I dont know if i could eat it.  But, next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"The line was long, which normally I would not have minded. However after waiting all that time, my sandwich was luke warm."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the sausage egg sandwich but they ran out of sausage at 8am???  I guess so it the open at midnight.  Went with the fairfax.  It was good.  Rich.  Got a cookie because I was craving for one.  It was hard/crunchy.  I'm guessing they tried to reheat it.  I was hoping it'll be crisp and chewy but it was really disappointing.  Would I come if the line is long?  No."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about egg slut so I decided I had to try it out while I was here in Vegas. I have to say I was a little disappointed. When we got to egg slut there was a line wrapping around but it only took us 15 minutes to get to the order area. We got the slut, gaucho and the fairfax. After ordering it took another 15 minutes to get our food. I thought the fairfax and gaucho were both okay. They felt pretty greasy. It's honestly food combinations I've had before and a friend commented that they could make this same sandwich at home if they tried. Obviously both were a couple steps up from a fast food breakfast sandwich but it wasn't spectacular. The slut was basically an egg on top of mashed potatoes. Again it was okay but I think this place is overrated. I would rather try other breakfast places then come back here again. It was filling but didn't match everything I've heard before coming here."}
{"text":"BEST EGGS IN VEGAS HANDS DOWN! I dont even like eggs but needed a good protein-fueled breakfast after a long plane ride."}
{"text":"Despite anytime you come here be prepared to wait, make sure your phone is fully charged or you bring reading material with you because it WILL be a long wait,  but rest assured that this wait will totally be worth it. A friend, my husband and I decided to come here for brunch 2 weeks ago on a Saturday morning after a night of somewhat hard partying in Vegas. We were all cranky and in need of carbs, cheese and grease to soak up the activities from the night before. After waiting what seemed for what seemed like a life time ( 30 Minutes ) we finally got to the front of the line to order our food. I got the Fairfax sandwich with a cookie and a biscuit  my hubby got the Gaucho. My sandwich was absolutely amazing !! Their sriracha mayo mixed with their scrambled eggs were exactly what I needed to get me out of my funk and to give me a kick to wake up and snap out of my bad mood. Probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches' I've ever eaten in my entire life.  Due to my martial obligation I had to give my husband a bite of my sandwich which I did reluctantly. He was totally blown away , he even said my sandwich was much better than his. My biscuit was unfortunately cold but it tasted like it would have been amazing if it was heated up. I absolutely recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, even as a snack. Delicious !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and the Hubs venture to the Strip
every so often just to come here. We're crazy cause there's always a long wait and this place is always packed. One would think all that for a simple egg breakfast/ sandwich? But I have to tell you there's nothing simple about these sandwiches! We get the Fairfax which has scrambled eggs, cheese, chives, caramelized onions and Sriracha mayo on a brioche bun. As simple as it sounds it's delicious!!! I'm only giving 4 stars because the last time I ate here my eggs had shells scrambled into them..."}
{"text":"Hella good! Simply put. Woke up with time to spare before our flight back home  so we headed over to the cosmopolitan to check out this highly recommended and trending place. My girlfriend follows the instagram page! Hellla good. My friend and I got the bacon egg and cheese and the cheeseburger with avocado. We cut them in half and the best of both worlds! So yummy and fulfilling."}
{"text":"So, I'm from LA, so I've been hearing about Eggslut for the past couple years, but there's always a giant line, so I figured I'd check out what the fuss was about while we're staying next door. There was still a pretty big line, but nothing like the one in LA, and it moves pretty quickly (took about 15 minutes, with a line of several dozen people)

Having now tried it, I give it 5 stars *only* for the Fairfax + turkey sausage I ordered - it's easy to make decent scrambled eggs, but next to impossible to get *perfectly* scrambled eggs, and the scrambled eggs in the Fairfax are *perfect*. It's a fairly substantial sandwich, and so tasty. Worth standing in line for, which is good, because you will be. I tried a bit of my wife's classic bacon sandwich, which I'd only give 4 stars - it was good, but I agree with her, it's not *that* much better than basically the same sandwich, just with less expensive base ingredients, from any fast food place's breakfast menu, for several dollars cheaper. I would go out of my way to get the Fairfax, not so much for their other sandwiches. 

And a solid 0 stars for a $5 biscuit, which just tasted like a biscuit. I told her it would, but she was like, no, I love biscuits, I bet theirs is amazing for that price. Nope, it was a good biscuit, but really, 5 bucks for just a regular sized pretty good biscuit? 

They also apparently gave our order to someone else, so in exchange, after sending our order back to the front of the queue, they tossed in a free cookie, which was nice of them - the cookie was tasty enough, and clearly fresh, but again, nothing too special, certainly not worth $5. 

So if I were to average everything we tried together, I'd probably have to give this place 3 stars. Luckily, I have total control and don't feel like doing that, because the Fairfax was too good. So just... don't get those other things, and get a Fairfax instead? :p"}
{"text":"Yuuuuum!! I've been hearing about eggslut for so long and finally got to try it! The line was around the corner so it took me about 30 minutes to order. I got the Fairfax sandwich and it was so yummy. I added avocado and bacon for some texture and it was heaaavenly. Not only was the sandwich light, it was perfect for an afternoon late lunch. After ordering, my food was ready within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about eggslut... it's the life of the party! 
I was told by several people that it's a must have for breakfast. I dragged my husbands from the wynn all the way to cosmo to test it out. I was a bit disappointed when I saw about 15chairs available and a line the size of a circus waiting. Damn. Clearly everyone got the memo. Typically, is turn around and go somewhere else, but since we made the trip we had to fight it out. 45mins later we ordered and brawled for 2 chairs (not really, but it makes the story better) :)
I got the fair fax and my husband got the sausage and egg. We also got the biscuit to share. Our meals were great, besides the tasteless biscuit; BUT not worth the wait! An hour for a breakfast sandwich hay didn't blow my mind is just not worth it. I'd only return if I stayed at the cosmo and there was no line... otherwise, a sit down restaurant will have to do. 
Still giving 4 stars for good food!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about Eggslut and was staying at the Cosmo so wanted to give it a try. The line was super long when we arrived around 8am so I figured it had to be good. We waited in line for around 20 mins. I didn't realize that once you ordered, it was another very long wait, another 20 mins. For all the great things I heard, I was overall disappointed. It was a decent breakfast sandwich, but certainly not worth the wait. I guess others must have a different experience than I had because it was very popular, but I could do without."}
{"text":"Located in the Cosmo. Open late. Such yummy food! Loved everything I got. I don't think you can go wrong with anything. Great quality and price isn't too bad."}
{"text":"I didn't run into the long lines that other reviewers wrote about, but I got to Eggslut around 8 in the morning.  Still, it took about 20 minutes to get my food.

The breakfast sandwich was good and the egg was cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also awesome, but the coffee was terrible.

There were a couple of big downsides here. The seating area was small and filthy, they should have somebody to clean up. I cannot imagine how bad it must be later in the day. Also, the food and drinks are really expensive: $8 for a small breakfast sandwich, $5 for a biscuit, and $5 for crummy coffee.  

It was ok, I won't be back, and don't think I'll be visiting their Los Angeles location either."}
{"text":"I'm going to begin by saying that I was quite possibly the biggest fan of Eggslut when it was just a mere LA/Arts District based food truck. I went nearly every weekend. I took all out-of-town visitors to said truck for them to have THE BEST breakfast sandwich they've ever had in their lives (The Fairfax)

Fast forward to Eggslut being sold, the truck shutting down, and a brick and mortar opening in Grand Central Market. I tried it multiple times and was disappointed every time. It was not the same at all.

Now fast forward, I'm in Vegas with husband and friends and we need food, bad! Eggslut is next door at the Cosmo and we all want it. I'm starving, I don't expect it to be as delicious as the original truck, I just want it bad.

We wait in line, sure, it was nearly noon after all. All the hungover Vegas people are just getting up after all. We waited 20 minutes or less for everything, no biggie. They were out of sausage, which made the girls in front of me quite upset. But I'm vegetarian, so I was fine. I knew what I was there for - The Fairfax, with avocado and a cold brew.

I'm losing one star because they forgot the avocado. Otherwise, maybe it's been so many years since I've had the original truck that I've forgotten the exact flavor and texture, maybe I was really hungry and a little hungover....But no, I believe that the Vegas location of Eggslut is nearly as good as the original food truck. Bravo Vegas, you got something right!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype or the wait is how I felt after spending 30 minutes in line and $8 for a reasonable but by no means exceptional sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich.  I've heard of waits as long as 1-2 hours, which is astounding.  Furthermore, as a fast food place I'm not sure how they have the gall to ask for gratuity.  There is no service to speak of, no seating, and because they're trying to sell you $4 bottles of Smart Water, I was told \"we don't have water\" when I asked.  Really?  So they don't wash dishes either?

Honestly, McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts do breakfast sandwiches nearly as good, for about half the price.  And included with those experiences is a cup of coffee, hash browns, and decent customer service without shamelessly asking for tips.  I'd opt to go there next time."}
{"text":"Yes the line is long. Yes it seems like it takes forever, especially if you were up until 5, or 6am. But it moves faster then it looks, and it's worth it. You have to get the cookie, and go with whatever breakfast sandwich you desire. The classic biscuit you can't go wrong with. This isn't a place that just tastes good because your hungover, you can really taste the heart, soul, and fun that they put into the food. It's what gets the people going when in LV!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see no line at eggslut at midnight. I actually thought they were closed. The woman was so nice and even showed me what their jarred egg specialty looked like but we decided since I was actually hungry, I should go for the bacon egg and cheddar sandwich. Wow it was perfect! It came out fast and hot and was the right amount of cooked with runny egg. Love! Worth the hype!"}
{"text":"I had higher expectations of this place. Waited in a not too long line and ordered the egg slut. Did taste like mashed potatoes. The bread was hard. Two of the three were toasted one was not. The flavor of the dish was just okay in my opinion  for 10 dollars I would have expected more. Also no place to sit. With this glass hot dish."}
{"text":"Omg sooooo delicious!! Breakfast sandwich was great and fresh. Also the biscuits are homemade and fresh and tasted great with the butter and syrup. So thrilled it was inside our resort."}
{"text":"So simple and so satisfyingly tasty. Awesome business idea. The eggs are cooked to perfection and the toppings compliment it so well. I wish they had more locations!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. We payed $20 per two burgers medium sized without any drinks. Overpriced since they have so much competition in Vegas and still keep it to good standards. They have good service, when we came there both times was no queue at all.
Very Limited seating area so take to go don't risks if u will not have seat.Just in case"}
{"text":"Is it worth the hype, price, & long wait? I'm glad I got to try it but it's not something I would go out of my way to eat again. It's good but I've had better"}
{"text":"So so many eggshells. For a place that specializes in eggs, this is awful. Attached a picture of one large piece."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time, after reading a magazine article on it. When I arrived, there was a line, but it moved pretty quickly.

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich, with added bacon. Boy was it delicious! The eggs were perfectly done, and the Sriracha aoli was on point! I also had one of their famous chocolate chunk cookies with grey salt. Talk about amazing! I would highly recommend this place. One side note - seating is limited. Luckily for me, a table opened up, just after I ordered."}
{"text":"Food is meh.  I didn't like the food all that much and they were super expensive. I would spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not as good as the one in LA. I got the fairfax with avocado, and while the egg was very soft and delicious, it wasn't hot! It was lukewarm. It's also pretty pricey for what it is. Line wasn't too long though I waited about 5-8 minutes for my sandwich. Pretty flavorful, but I was disappointed that it was just lukewarm."}
{"text":"Got the Egg Slut and the Fairfax. 

The Egg Slut was basically an egg over potato puree, with three thin slices of baguette. Not flavorful and not filling. Not recommended.

The Fairfax was good - the eggs were very creamy and buttery, the brioche bun was decent if a tad dry.

They didn't have tap water available, for that you have to walk 30 feet to a nearby bar, which I thought was odd."}
{"text":"Egg-ceptional and I'm not egg-sagerating that either. Service is GREAT. Amanda greets you with a huge smile and recommend me to get the Fairfax... PLEASE LISTEN TO HER! Order 10 Fairfax if you can. No better way to cure a hangover in Vegas. Keep in mind you're at the Cosmopolitan so it is going to be LOUD. Oh, and don't be cheap.. add bacon and avocado to your sandwich $14 won't make you broke."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this franchise before but my Cousin steered me in the right direction here!  Everything was cooked perfectly!  No grease, it was extremely fresh!  I would suggest sticking to the brioche bun instead of their biscuit.  The Chipotle ketchup wasn't as spicy which was perfect!  Definitely stop here!"}
{"text":"I really went in with high expectations and and was not that thrilled. only reason I am giving them 3 stars is because the eggs are flavorful and it's very clean.... other than that its just basic..... prices are high for what you get and not filling either and the Turkey sausage was rubbery and super chewy and a can of soda is $5 lol that blew me away ......poop eggslut you have disappointed my hype"}
{"text":"I've been following Eggslut in LA for awhile now, so I was ecstatic when I found out there was one in the Cosmo! I've been dying to try \"The Slut\" which is a jar of gooey eggs on top of pureed potatoes, served with toast; the breakfast sandwiches all look and sound delicious and are served on brioche - my fave!

The line on a Sat at 8am was around the corner, surprising for Vegas standards. So I waited until 9am to see if it died down but the line got longer (to the bathroom), which you'd think would move quickly since it's a fast food type joint... but it does not. 

I was advised not to order the breakfast sandwiches because the bread was stale, and it was overall mediocre and expensive. Instead, I ordered the Slut which was disappointingly mediocre. I had a bite and didn't finish. Also the bread was stale!

Pro-tip: They reopen at midnight, visit then - there are NO LINES at all!"}
{"text":"Since we came in the morning around prime breakfast time on a Sunday, we had to wait in the long line for about 20 minutes before we could order but it was pretty worth it! I ordered the slut which was not a sandwich but like nothing I had ever seen before. I loved the idea of dipping bread into a cup of mashed potato and gooey eggy goodness. The olive oil on the bread was a yummy touch. I wish it came with a few more slices of bread since it wasn't too filling but it was still extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"We are here at 5am after a long night of drinking. I ordered some kind of mashed potatoes and egg in a mason jar with a side of toast.  It was reallllly good.  Unexpected.  But good.  Would eat again if the line wasn't so dang long."}
{"text":"I had \"Eggslut\" for the first time when I was in Las Vegas. My girlfriend has been wanting to take me for breakfast. The line was huge, but they quickly took orders and we were ordering within a couple minutes. Staff was very friendly. Sometimes food in a hotel can be \"less appetizing\" but Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan was great! Fresh eggs, bacon, and avocado on my breakfast sandwich definitely hit the spot! 
My ONLY complaint is the smell of old egg on the counter tops. I'm personally not a fan of the smell of eggs if they have not been properly cleaned off a counter top. It's usually the over easy eggs when the yolk doesn't get properly cleaned up. For this reason, my girlfriend and I had to find a table away from Eggslut. Other than that, this place was great and definitely worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is always an LA fave for me. 
Bringing anything, from anywhere, to Vegas, I feel, just loses their shine. 
It might not be vegas, but these places that are known to taste amazing somewhere else, just doesn't cut it when it's here. 
But hey, still great if you've never tried the original!"}
{"text":"On the fence between a 4 and a 5 star, why are there no half stars? 4.5 for Eggslut!

The food lives up to the name and the price is unheard of in Las Vegas! Only downside was the line (kinda makes sense with all these fans). We waited a little over half an hour to order and it took a little while my sandwich to come out. I think it was forgetten about compared to the rest of my crew who recieved some of their orders much earlier than I. Overall, it rocked though and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Walked almost a mile to get here.... the journey was well worth it!! Had the bacon, egg and cheese samich!! Who wouldn't eat at a place with the word slut in it. Ha! Would love to know where they came up with the name... reminds me of biscuit bitches in Seattle! Eggslut is a must while in Vegas for a quick breakfast!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Breakfast
Eggslut is delicious, you have to get there early or there is almost always a line that wraps around the corner. Very worth the value and wait for the meal. It's quick, easy and very good. 

I had one of the specialty items, coddled eggs on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives. 

I enjoyed that item so much I have not gotten anything else. But will definitely be trying more upon my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Worth waiting around for The Slut! I'm not sure what the line is like on the weekend. We waited about 30 mins from the time we got in line (which was going down the hallway) until we got our food. The line might be long, but once you place your order, it doesn't take long. Recommend it even with long lines!"}
{"text":"Will I ever find an egg sandwich that's better than Eggslut? Who knows! But until then, I'll keep coming back here in every city that has one.
My second time at Eggslut but first time at this location. I came at 9am on a Monday and the line was LONG, but it moved quickly. We waited about 30 minutes in total. I ordered the Fairfax Sandwich and I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.
First, they give a generous amount of scrambled eggs which I really appreciate. The Sriracha mayo and caramelized onions go so well with this sandwich. It's so simple yet so complex. The bun has to be one of the best sandwich buns I've ever had. It's flaky, warm, buttery, and soft. I really wonder how they make it so delicious.
You can't go wrong with the Fairfax sandwich and I highly recommend stopping by if you have a chance."}
{"text":"Over rated, greasy, slow. Tasted like a regular turkey burger with an egg and lots of has grease. The slut was just egg on too of mashed potatoes in a little jar.Not worth the money. Muffin was not with it..it was cold, dry and typical...Not worth$5"}
{"text":"Scrumptious eggs!!! The wait is normally worth it (I'm talking about the 15-20 minute ones) because the food is delicious. My friends from out of town always come here and I usually tag along to eat as well. I like the egg sandwich that's comes with steak. It is worth the money in a opinion since you are in Las Vegas.

There is something about how they cook their eggs, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a nice sandwich in the morning on the strip. I like the fact that their eggs are organic. Tastes really good! (Even though I don't believe their sandwich are that healthy, cuz it's burger style.) Reasonable price for sandwich/burgers. BTW, their egg slut tastes amazing, too!"}
{"text":"The most I can say about Eggslut is that I didn't hate the place. The food however was not that good (I got a sandwich with scrambled eggs, cheese, and sautéed onions). Though the onions were actually really good, the eggs were under seasoned and didn't actually stay inside the bread, so I ended up eating mostly bread for a while (plain tasting) and then mostly egg for a while (also plain tasting).

The wait is super long, we waited for almost an hour; the pricing is crazy expensive for what you get (I almost got the Eggslut but realized it was TINY); and the eggs are plain. It was pretty cool to watch them make the food, though. It was fine to go to once to understand the hype, but I wouldn't say it's worth it to go again."}
{"text":"\"Can I have one slut\", to the cashier, trying not to laugh while placing my order. After watching a friend's Eggslut Facebook post, I Yelped this place and did my research, bookmarked and made sure I stop by here while on my Vegas vacation. Located at The Cosmopolitan hotel, which was so convenient for me. We stayed right across from Cosmopolitan so we walked over to Eggslut. As I head to the 2nd level, I see the famous Eggslut logo, I looked at the line which wasn't so bad but didn't see the end of the line which was near the bathroom. The line got longer after I stood in line and I am glad I arrived 5 mins earlier. Don't let the long line stop you from trying out this place, the lines do move quick. The wait in line helped me and my other half decide on what to order, the other half went to get us a table across of Eggslut. When it was my turn in line, I placed my order one slut (10.50), one fair fax (8.50), side bacon (3.00), and extra baguette (no charge) . ( I learned this from reading the Yelp reviews & tips) paid for my meal and waited for my name to be called. I got to see the the cooks in action prepping the slut and all the good stuff. My name was called in less than 10 minutes. Everything was package nicely. The Fairfax in a nice brown bag and the slut came in a mason jar with baguette. The other half found us nice seats. I love all the seats, its so trendy. I had to take a ton of pictures before we were ready to eat.  My other half and I both shared our orders and we loved our breakfast, esp. the slut. 

The Fairfax, cage-free scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sriracha mayo, in a warm brioche bun. I loved the egg so fluffy and along with the bun, everything was perfect together. The Fairfax tasted exactly as the description. YUMS!!

The Slut is their specialty, cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Directions for eating the Slut was to mix it first, and I spread the slut on to my baguette, instead of dipping my baguette. I added the bacon to my baguette, I loved the bacon, it was cooked to perfection. 

Overall, I was so happy I finally get to try this place, we went here on the day of my anniversary, which we had a delicious breakfast to celebrate our 22nd!! I can't wait for more Eggsluts, when I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Talk about yolk porn!! 
Eggslut surpassed all my foodie dreams! This place is super hyped, with a line out the door (and around the corner), thanks to a heavy social media reputation.  But they definitely lived up to expectation.  Gooey golden yolks of dripping perfection!
Located in the Cosmopolitan, this modern and edgy breakfast counter totally fits right in.  When we arrived just before 10am, the line was crazy long and almost deterring.  But slightly hung over and craving that glorious yellow, we decided to tough it out.  The line moves fast, so by 10:30am we were placing our orders at the register.
Here's the scoop--
*The Slut ($10)
A quick impulse add-on to our order, but probably the highlight of my meal.  Soft cooked egg over hot and smooth potato puree, garnished with salt and chives and served with baguette slices.  DELICIOUS.
*Fairfax ($8) +Sausage ($3)
Soft-Scrambled eggs done perfectly!  Not overcooked or dry like regular scrambled eggs can get. Sirracha Mayo added a nice kick.  And the Brioche bun was soft and buttery.  The sausage add on is a must, as I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much without the added salt/protein element.
*Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich ($8.50)
This was my husband's order.  He said this was good, but he has had better-- just your basic breakfast sandwich.  He also mentioned that it would have been better on sourdough, and although I am a big Brioche fan, I actually agree.  The sour tang would have paired great with the creamy egg yolk.  But then again, were from San Francisco, home of the famous Sourdough. :)
*House Made Buttermilk Biscuit ($5)
This was served with butter and syrup, but would have been better warmed up.  The piece I had was slightly dry and crunchy.  At $5, I would have skipped this one.
I should also mention that I purchased a coffee for $5, which was the size of a Starbuck Tall, and nothing but simple brewed coffee.  Definitely overpriced.
Everything we had at Eggslut was great!  If you ask my husband, it was okay.  But still worth it for the IG pics. :) If nothing else, definitely get The Slut!  Pictures and descriptions do not do it justice!
We will be back again, Eggslut!"}
{"text":"Not cheap, but best bacon and egg sandwich I have ever had. Period.  Sometimes expensive is worth it... this is one of them"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a funny name like Eggslut. They have fun with it from their chicken tracks imprinted on the floor to their \"we recycle our sluts\" sign by the garbage (referring to the glass jars their Slut comes in). And their food is on par with their humor. 
I got the Fairfax and added bacon and avocado on a brioche bun. The ingredients were fresh and held their own with all the other flavors. Not lots of reading space, but there are a couple trebles there. 
There was a line, but it didn't take long AND everything is fresh made right there."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The line was a bit daunting, but it moved really fast. And $5 for coffee was a little excessive, but the food was totally worth it. Had the Fairfax and the Slut and they were worth every calorie.  Want to go back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm always up for a good egg sandwich for breakfast.  As such, the wife and I had to give Eggslut a try.  We arrived around 10AM on a Monday morning.  There was a short line, but it moved fast since the menu was very concise, there weren't many customization options to consider, orders were taken efficiently, and the kitchen pumped out food at very steady pace.  The wife and I shared a Fairfax ($8, soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun) w/bacon (add $3) and a Slut ($10), a coddled egg on top of potato purée cooked in a small Mason jar topped with chives and served with a toasted baguette slices.  Our Fairfax was hot, fresh, and satisfying, but messy and somewhat difficult to eat trying to keep it all together.  The light, airy brioche bun was the true star of the sandwich.  The Slut was simple, yet delicious.  Honestly, it outshined the Fairfax by a country mile.  Was Eggslut a bit overpriced?  Perhaps, but I thought their use of fresh, quality ingredients justified the price.  Is Eggslut a horrible name for restaurant?  I'm no prude, but it may be off-putting to some, which would be a shame since Egglut is easily the best place for breakfast at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"Food here is good but be patient, the line warps around the corner. They need to have one in every city."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit on the high side of what I would want to pay for the food, but this is Vegas and we must pay the Vegas upcharge.

I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, the Gaucho and the Slut, bringing my total to almost $30. The sandwiches aren't anything to write home about but the Slut was pretty good (I split it with a friend so it wasn't too filling). The coddled egg is served in a little jar that you can keep as a memento if you feel like washing all the egg, bread and grease out of it!

Overall, glad I tried it but I don't necessarily feel like this is a place that I'm going to NEED to hit every time I'm here."}
{"text":"Wow! Usually not a fan of strip food AT ALL. But eggslut blows it out of the water with their service and food! 

Put an egg on anything and I'm game!!! The brioche bun is the perfect consistency! I love the thickness, to die for. 

We also tried the biscuit and the salted chocolate cookie' sooooooooooooooooo goood!!!! 

So flakey and buttery! Better than KFC and childhood nostalgia! 


I've heard great Things about the eggslut in California, but have yet to be able to try it! 


For sure to be coming back to this place over secret pizza any new day! Plus it's open late nights! Perfect drunk food!!!"}
{"text":"Based on the name alone this place belongs in Vegas. I'm from the East Coast and have never heard of Eggslut. I'm glad we tried it.

First the GOOD:
We found the quality and taste of our meals to be very, very good. I had the Slut (I had to write that once) which is basically an egg over easy on top of potato puree in a small glass jar with slices of a bagugette. It was hot and smelled wonderful. The flavors together were so good. My friends each had the egg and cheese sandwich with turkey sausage. They loved the flavor and how hardy it was. There is some seating or you can mosey on over to the Chandelier Bar and have a couch seat (they didn't seem to mind). 

Now for the NOT SO GOOD:
We went at 9am on a Thursday morning. The line was 45+ minutes which we expected. After about 10 minutes I walked to the front of the line just to see what was going on. The assembly line of cooks and food prep people was being run well, like a military line. The problem seemed to be the ONE person taking the orders. There were 2 stations to take orders but only one employee. He was very nice but slow and if someone ordered a drink, he would have to stop what he was doing and make their drink! Operationally, they need to have someone else (a kitchen person) making the drinks so he doesn't have to stop taking orders. I would also suggest they have an employee walk down the line taking some orders on paper to make the transactions quicker when they get to the register.

Also - I wasn't going to clean my glass jar and take it back to New York but I felt badly just throwing it out. They need a recycle bin for these jars next to the garbage cans.

Overall - I can't wait to dine here again when I'm back in Vegas. Maybe I'll get lucky and Eggslut will open in New York City. No joke necessary!"}
{"text":"There is usually a line but it moves steadily and it's worth the wait if you are an egg/breakfast sandwich connoisseur. If you just need to stuff your gullet with some eggs on toast, White Castle does breakfast sliders (no shade, sometimes that's what u need). 

Eggslut has mastered their eggs. I got the cheeseburger and they even accomodated my gluten-allergic ass by putting it on mixed greens, word. It was really filling and gave me energy til the evening. Bf got a breakfast sandwich and still talks about it.

Anyway, this is some fine handling of eggs. An eggslut egg is made in a pan but it doesn't get brown on the bottom and yet the white is COOKED PERFECTLY!!!! 

The result is an egg that is soft and yielding, not rubbery, with a silky yolk  and no sliminess; like a poached egg but firmer. 

It's simple and done well. 

Eggslut has bar seating (cramped) and some cushy and adorable egg-shaped seating outside of the shop. It's not a place where you really want to have a sit-down meal, more of a quick bite kind of stop."}
{"text":"The food here was very savory but really pricey (that's vegas). Seating was very limited."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the Egg slut hype, probably one of the best sausage egg sandwiches I've had. Nothing to die for though. It's a nice addition for a relatively cheap ear option for breakfast or late night at the cosmo"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday morning so the line was a bit long but went super fast! Seating is limited but if you travel in a group/pair it's best to have someone grab some seats for when your food is ready. I got the fairfax with avocado and turkey sausage. This totaled to about $15, but let me tell you, it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. The bread was sweet, the eggs were perfectly seasoned and savory and paired with a cold brew, it was the perfect combination. It is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Long long long line for meh breakfast.  I had the Slut, biscuit and orange juice.  The slut was a lot smaller than expected and super salty.   The biscuit while good was nothing special.   KFC serves a similar biscuit in my opinion.  Honestly don't waste your time here just cause of the fun name."}
{"text":"OK GUYS I WAS DYING TO TRY THIS PLACE...

I saw a bunch of celebs post about Eggslut in LA so on the plane I got curious to see if LV had one and THEY DO. Right inside the Cosmopolitan by the beautiful chandelier.

Be prepared to stand in line, HOWEVER, the like moved very quickly! Especially for 8:45am on a Sunday. 

Staff is SUPER friendly and loves to give you suggestions, we talked to a guy who loves  he Broncos as much as we do so that was fun! 

The food... omg deliciousness and so fresh. I mean you literally watch them crack the eggs and take the bacon out and put it on the grill.

Gluten Free options available.

I had the bacon, egg & cheese and wanted seconds. I ate it slow so I could really enjoy it! People behind us had come 3 days in a row, that's just how good it is! 

Fresh squeezed orange juice $5
Breakfast sandwiches are about $9

So worth the wait and the price! 

Do yourself a favor & Eggslut it up"}
{"text":"Really good sandwich spot. I tried the Fairfax and it was delicious. The fresh ingredients make a simple concept like an egg sandwich quite the culinary experience. The spot is really small and busy seating. The staff was very friendly and enjoying the work they were doing."}
{"text":"Definitely overhyped. We waited 45 min for a sandwich on a Wednesday at 11am. I'd eat it again, if someone gave it to me and I didn't have to wait for it, but definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here. The sandwich was good, but not something that I couldn't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at eggslut, for it being my first time. I'm from LA so my only reference of the restaurant was the Grand Central Market location, and I always avoid it because the line is long. 

The line was long here too, but it seemed to go by pretty quickly. I also ordered the Fairfax burger but I legit ate it so quickly that I couldn't even snap a picture! It was honestly so good. It was perfect the way you imagine the perfect boy. It checked off all the requirements. It was soft and juicy and cheesy and the eggs . It was amazing. I want another. 

Again, I ate that burger so quick, I didn't even give myself a chance to post it on any social media platforms. It didn't make it to snapchat, it didn't make it to Instagram stories. It made it straight to my mouth. Go to eggslut, every chance you can."}
{"text":"Eggslut is finally here in Vegas! After having the LA location bookmarked for ages I am glad to say I was not missing out. 

I had the fairfax with bacon, making it a $10+ breakfast sandwich. The fairfax was nice and buttery with fluffy scrambled eggs, sriracha mayo, and bacon.

My friend had the slut, which is a coddled egg, potato purée and some salt. She was not impressed.  Luckily, she had also ordered a breakfast sandwich. 

Positives: line moves fast, food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. 

The chocolate cookie with sea salt was the best thing I had at Eggslut! 

Maybe this place has the \"secret pizza\" effect, where late night intoxication makes the food taste better. *shrugs*

{"text":"Lived up to the hype, I must say!

But, damn, it is expensive for an egg sandwich. Worth, 10/10 would come again.

Eggslut is near one of the entrances, near Marquee. It shouldn't be too hard to find! If lost, find the huge pink chandelier centerpiece.

Line was a little long. There were about 10 people ahead of us. But it moved, and there were restrooms nearby if you needed a relief.

I got the sausage sandwich for myself and the bacon for the bf. I forgot there was a fried egg inside, so when I took a bite, something exploded LOL. I was a little confused.. and then it hit me. So yes just a little reminder!!

My friends got the burger which took a little extra longer to come out.

Definitely a novelty, but it was delicious. I recommend coming here if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, from the fluffy eggs to the delicious cold brew coffee. I would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Teased by the Cosmo for almost a year, the long awaited Eggslut has finally opened and...

REALLY?!?

There is nothing wrong with the sandwich.  How can you not like soft scrambled eggs imbued with butter, bacon, caramelized onions, melted cheddar cheese and the warm spicy kick of siracha on a fresh, gently sweetened brioche bun (Fairfax)?  Great combo but come on, $12???  A $3 premium over the LA location.

The bacon, egg & cheese sandwich (fried egg, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup on a brioche bun) A-OK.  It's a fried egg sandwich.  Eat it quick or the egg yolk will quickly soak into the bun making a soggy mess.  $8.

Finally the \"slut\" (coddled egg on a silky smooth potato puree cooked in a jar) is definitely interesting.  Mix it all up to incorporate the salt, chives, and yolk into the potato then spoon.  Basically a pureed breakfast slathered on a piece of toasted baguette.  Sans the baguette, perhaps in my golden years when the dentures hurt but for now, I prefer solid food.  $10.

To their credit, the applewood smoked bacon is well sourced.  Meaty with controlled salinity.  The eggs (cage free) do have a more pronounced yolky flavor.

A fast food restaurant with fast food friendly service.  A little clumsy but this visit was opening day.  It should improve.

In the end, creative food truck grub at astronomical Vegas resort pricing.  

To each his own but this slut is not for me."}
{"text":"People rave about this food and I am unsure why. After waiting for 30 minutes in line I had only about 6 choices of breakfast sandwiches. I was able to a make a choice I liked, but was disappointed when I received it. My meal was not nearly as warm as I anticipated, the eggs were heavily overeasy and oozing with each bite. The roll in which my egg sandwich came on tasted like a buttered stale hamburger roll. Additionally, I payed an extra $3 to add bacon on my sandwich; I received ONE piece."}
{"text":"Loving the new spot! From LA to Las Vegas as equally delicious! My favorite still has be hands down the fairfax. Egglicious! A totally different way to get slutty in Vegas and not take anything home. I love bacon, I love cheese, I love eggs.. The food here is phenomenal. I must go back! Not to mention it's the best cure for a hangover!"}
{"text":"If you want to go here on a weekend, come EARLY. As in like, morning early. Because if you get here in the middle of the day like 12pm-1pm, you will wait in line for a while. We waited in line for about an hour and then once we ordered our food, it took about 15-20 minutes to come out. There are a couple tables and stools as well as some tables across the walkway so you have to be on the lookout when there's an open space and take it for yourself.

The way they make it is like an assembly line. You have one person making the eggs, making the bacon, putting the sandwiches together, etc. I noticed that the guy cooking the eggs would throw away an egg he cracked on the pan if it wasn't perfect, so you see the standards that they hold themselves to. 

I ordered the Fairfax ($8.50) which seems to be their most popular sandwich. It's scrambled eggs with cheese and some caramelized onions. It's REALLY fluffy and soft and you'll bite right through it with ease. It was good but I was not full by the end of the meal and I was a bit disappointed.

A friend did say that he added bacon and avocado to his Fairfax and it was really good so I guess those couple extra dollars make a big difference in the meal. That could potentially be a bad sign knowing that in order to really enjoy it you have to spend a total of $13+ on a sandwich that will not fill you up. 

Don't expect too much like I did but it is nice for those who want to get the slutty experience."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas I really didn't want to venture too far outside of the Cosmopolitan for breakfast, luckily Eggslut was located inside my hotel and it quickly became my go to choice for breakfast.

The concept here is simple with a menu focusing on eggs. For both my visits I went with the standard Bacon, Egg & Cheese and the Sausage, Egg & Cheese. Both sandwiches were served on a warm brioche bun and more than enough to satisfy my hunger until lunch. One morning I did also order a Buttermilk Biscuit, which was served with butter and maple syrup however it wasn't the greatest so I just stuck with a sandwich the following morning. Prices here are rather high, however, nothing is cheap in Vegas so that was expected.

My advice is to arrive early as it gets very crowded and might find yourself waiting in a rather long line, however, don't worry as it tends to move pretty fast. All food here is prepared to order so you know you are getting the freshest sandwich. Overall Eggslut is a solid choice if you are staying inside the Cosmopolitan, I am sure other options could be found in other nearby hotels that are just as good."}
{"text":"Impressed with experience.  Unique presentation, excellent food, friendly service greeted by chef, and overall positive happy environment.   Would definitely recommend this awesome place."}
{"text":"Totally over rated.  Long lines for sandwiches that are no better than anywhere else.  I think the lines have more to do with the fact that Vegas is lacking in quick breakfast spots than the fact that the food here is amazing.  If no line, go ahead but otherwise not worth it."}
{"text":"Hella good. Definitely worth the wait. Make sure you come here while you're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwiches.  A little messy, but very tasty.  The only downsides were a long wait standing in line, and the fact that there was only very limited seating, so we ended up over in the nearby cocktail lounge area, which was closed at that time of day, belly up to the empty bar -- not great, but workable."}
{"text":"Eggslut is located on the second floor of The Cosmopolitan & is a hot spot for breakfast & egg lovers. Or if the timing is right, it could be a cool place to grab an afternoon snack. The line was long around mid morning/early lunch but passing thru just before closing was the perfect opportunity to do breakfast for dinner. No lines or crowds to speak of in the evening.

My visit was more like a pre-dinner appetizer since there were so many other places I wanted to visit in such a short amount of time. Just be aware they close at 7pm.

Very limited seating, all communal style. And there is nowhere to sit in the immediate vicinity if it's crowded so you might wanna be prepared to take it to-go. Finding a seat near the Chandelier bar just seems awkward to me.

Since it was close to closing I scored extra toast for my slut. It was just the right amount for this carboholic. The silken coddled egg was perfectly seasoned with gray salt & beneath that was a layer of buttery potato goodness so no complaints from me. Wish I could try everything on the menu here so I'll have to return again."}
{"text":"Worth the long line in the mornings!  The sandwiches are large and you can pretty much get anything you might imagine with eggs."}
{"text":"This tiny little breakfast spot in the cosmopolitan makes probably the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a while and at a great price. I ordered the sausage breakfast sandwich and loved every last bite , From The fresh  bread to the delicious house made sausage inside with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg etc! It's a generous sized sandwich and does get messy if you choose sunny side or over easy egg inside BUT you can also get your egg scrambled. The staff was also very efficient and friendly. Their specialty is breakfast sandwiches and the location itself Is not huge so it's not really a sit down restaurant, although There is some seating but very limited , most people take their orders to go . If you're hungry make sure you get there a little early because there is usually a lineup but I can't say we waited overly long to be served. All in all I wish they had a location in my city so I could enjoy one of their sandwiches any time !"}
{"text":"I don't know who thought of the Slut but they deserve an award! I had the Slut twice in 4 days and it was delicious! The perfectly creamy mashed potatoes under a perfectly cooked egg, stirred together and eaten with crispy slices of bread... WHO KNEW IT WOULD BE SO AMAZING??? Needless to say I'm a HUGE fan. (Oh I also had the honey butter biscuit which was good and a bacon breakfast sandwich which was sooo good but the Slut is the star here because it's so unique). I'll 100% be back next time I'm in Vegas. 

Ps everyone who works here is SO SO friendly. Both times, the people who packaged my food to go did it with such care and with the biggest smiles on their faces, something so rare in customer service."}
{"text":"Lucky for me I came here during off-peak hours and only had to wait in line for about 5 min before ordering. I got the sausage egg and cheese sandwich and really enjoyed it. The staff is really friendly and the sandwich is a really interesting mix between a gourmet restaurant breakfast sandwich and an egg mcmuffin from starbucks...its definitely somewhere in the middle in a good way. I enjoyed eating this for breakfast, but there is no way in hell I would ever wait an hour...or even 30 min in line for this."}
{"text":"If you're looking at the long line and ask yourself, \"is it worth the wait?\" YES IT IS. Get in line, get on your phone and take some selfies. The line moves at a decent pace. 

My friends got the SLUT cause who doesn't want to try one? It's pretty good but definitely ask for more bread. 

I got the Egg Sausage sandwich and it's the best egg sandwich I've ever had. I wish they had more locations and I hope they expand out to AZ."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you probably want to come here for the simple fact that it's called Eggslut.  It's just fun to say.  Besides the cool name, they also serve up a really good breakfast sandwich. 
 
We came around 2pm on a Sunday and only waited 10-15 min. to order and get our food.  It's a small place, but you can find seating within the Cosmopolitan.  The girl handing out the orders looked like she really didn't want to be there, but I ignored that and focused on the food.  

I highly recommend the Fairfax ($8).  It's scrambled eggs, carmelized onions, cheddar, chives and sriracha mayo sandwiched in a soft brioche bun.  I added bacon ($3) and avocado ($2), which was pricey but made it extra delicious.  The ingredients were good quality and the sriracha mayo added the right amount of spice. 

My only gripe is that they charge $5 for a can of Sprite!  That's a ridiculous mark up and I still had to ask for a cup of ice.  Bring your own beverage and just get the food here.  I lied... one other gripe is that they don't serve hash browns or fries.  I missed having my starchy side.

They are a pretty well-oiled machine and you can see the sandwiches being put together in an assembly line.  However, my bf ordered the cheeseburger and they oddly forgot the meat patty.  Luckily we didn't go far before noticing and they remade it right away.  

Overall, I would come back here when I'm craving a simple tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go to the one in LA, since I got to taste a sandwich from them at Feast Portland last September. I had no idea they were here, so I was happy to find they'd opened this location!
It's just a little counter, limited seating. They know how to make an egg, that's for sure! My only real criticism (not that they asked me) is that the brioche buns they use are too big. I have had better/fresher brioche. I ended up pulling the top off mine. And: this is an 87 napkin experience. I just think they should splash out for better napkins, instead of the thin thin thin ones.
Good cold brew coffee.
Worth going!"}
{"text":"We waited quite a while for our food but it was definitely worth the wait! Limited seating but the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband loved his omelet but the only thing I tried was the chocolate chip cookie. It was one of the best cookies I'd ever tried. It SHOULD be for $4.50. Happily it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I tried the eggslut and the gaucho - underwhelmed by both.  Given the line (time investment) and cost, will not return. The chocolate cookie was awesome; if not for that, they would be getting 2 stars. Unless you have a food allergy (my friend with a soy allergy was very appreciative of their ingredients) or want to wait in line for a really good cookie, enjoy some other breakfast option."}
{"text":"I stayed at the cosmo so it was an easy access for light breakfast. Great atmosphere, great musics, and the food was fantastic. The place do have a line in the morning (~9ish) but it's not horrifically bad. The line actually moves pretty fast and the food were served relatively quick. The slut is to die for with their perfectly cooked baguette (Ask for extra baguette). I also ordered bacon egg sandwiches. The chipotle ketchup gives the sandwiches a special taste. Bacon was cooked perfectly crunchy to go along w the brioche. High recommended."}
{"text":"Took over 30 minutes to wait In line to order food. My advice: get there early! 
The food is worth the wait. The only negative thing is finding a place to seat down to eat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas and I wish so badly we had an egg slut on the east coast! I had heard great things about this place prior to my trip so as a foodie, I knew it was somewhere I needed to try! 

A small corner in the Cosmopolitan, there is an open grill and counter-style ordering. There is a small amount of bar style seating as well as some lounge style seating right across the hall. Perfect stop for a quick breakfast, or breakfast style lunch or dinner quite honestly I could have ate here every day. 

I ordered \"The Slut\" which is a mason jar type of glass cup filled with mashed potatoes topped with a poached egg, salt and a side of toast. I also asked for a side of the honey mustard aioli. O-M-G. Incredible. An absolute must have. This was easily one of my favorite meals while in Las Vegas. So much so I went back twice for the same thing!"}
{"text":"The line looked short but when you cut the corner it's looong. The good thing was that it was moving. I noticed there was only 1 person at the register which seemed bananas. To be honest, the wait was worth it. Perhaps 20 minutes tops at 11am. Once I ordered the gal was very warm and welcoming. It does feel a little weird to have an order of a \"slut\" the food was delicious and I see why people rave about the food. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, but be preared to wait.  The line does get long, but it is worth it.  The ability to customize is also great.  You can take a dish, add meats, avocado, or even switch your breakfast sandwich to a salad.  I switched my tri-tip sandwich to a salad with arugula, red onion, and avocado.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is good usually but this time around it was sort of mediocre. I know it's Vegas prices and all but $9 for a simple egg sandwich is pretty stupid. I also had a bone in my turkey sausage and nearly cracked a fkn tooth."}
{"text":"Delightful treat! Hearty Sandwiches! Homemade fresh buns stuffed with Turkey sausage cheddar cheese and of course egg!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I am admittedly hard to please when it comes to brunch. Coming from SF, where brunch is basically a competitive sport, I've literally seen and eaten it all. I was so excited to try this in Vegas because I have been wanting to go to the LA location for years... mostly because I've seen it on instagram and the name is funny. #millennial

My friend and I waited in line for an eternity and a half (I mean 25 minutes) before ordering. The entire time, we were watching the bar/countertop seating area for open seats. For such a popular place, there are not NEARLY enough seating to meet the demand. Also, the seating area could use some clean-up between diners - lots of grease around. We eventually grabbed two seats and ate our breakfast sandwiches while the couple next to us shared one chair to eat (just to give you a visual of how tight the space is). The sandwiches were honestly meh. Yes, they were tasty, but being slightly hungover, we expected to LOVE our sandwiches. We didn't. It just was not extraordinary in any way, but what you get is exactly what is listed on the menu... Does that make sense? For all the hype and wait time, I expected rainbow unicorn glitter to come exploding out of my sandwich or something. Maybe we should have ordered the slut, their namesake. Or maybe their food could have just lived up to the hype. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably good! Great hangover cure 

I ordered the fairfax with avocado and my boyfriend ordered the gaucho. They were both absolutely delicious.

We asked for some sriracha which made the food above standard - highly recommend. Do yourselves a favor and go here.

Forgot to mention. Get there early, we arrived at 9:15 and waited 30 min to get to the front of the line and an additional ~5 min for our food."}
{"text":"A must eat breaky when in Vegas! The bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich was amazing! We ordered the Slut because we wanted to try what they were known for! Highly recommend, the mix between the potato and egg is delicious. The prices are kinda of high but what do you gotta complain about you're in Vegas eating one of the best breakfast sandwiches in town!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious egg sandwich. 
Its not a NY egg sangwich, but when in Vegas... 

Not enough seating."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

The eggslut makes amazing breakfast sandwiches. Their bacon is Crispy and a great cut! They give you plenty in your sandwich so you don't feel cheated! 

We got:
- Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich- their egg is very gooy so you get the runny yolk in your sandwich and it's delicious

-Slut- I love saying it! Lol! It's mash potatoes in a jar with poached egg with Crispy baguette pieces that you dip into the jar. How can you do wrong with this yummy madness!! 

- sausage, egg, and cheese is just as yummy as the bacon! 

- biscuit was delicious! Baked Crispy and soft."}
{"text":"Sampled egg bacon and cheese Sammie on brioche bun - delish! $8

Line is off putting but moves along. Need more vigilance on wiping off counter - sticky from syrup."}
{"text":"Usually a long line so I never was that interested. Walking by around 2:00pm in a Sunday, I stepped up and entered. 

A clean short menu and a great  helpful woman was there to take my order. 

Cheeseburger with ground angus beef, cage-free over medium egg, caramelized onions, bread and butter pickles, cheddar cheese, and dijonnaise in a brioche bun. No fries, so none taken. 

As a burger slut myself, she was delightfully delicious. A real slut! Beautiful, soft, tender, succulent, hot, slithery, and moist. Every taste was heavenly. Overwhelming, I just had to slow down, rest, and savor each bite! 

Even as exhilarating the experience was, she lost one star. No line, but kept me waiting anxiously for ten minutes to come to me. Yelling out my name to come hither  helped."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I ordered a Fairfax with avocado, and the eggs were cooked and seasoned exactly how I like them. The other components of the sandwich worked together well with the eggs. I would have liked a little more heat from the Sriracha mayonnaise and a softer texture for the brioche bun, but those technicalities were overshadowed by the overall flavor of the sandwich. 

In terms of environment, this location is small, with limited seating. There was also a pretty long line when we arrived at about 8:30 in the morning. Service is typical counter service.

Although the food is great, it's also very overpriced for the portion you get. $12 for a breakfast sandwich the size of my fist? While the price would prevent me from visiting often, I think every now and then, when I'm feeling rich, I'd like to stop by for a delicious egg creation."}
{"text":"I have to start my description about this place by saying wow!!!  I loved the concept of the eggslut.  My wife wasn't too crazy about a soft boiled egg.  However, even if you're not, all you need to do is stir it up and you're good to go.  The fairfax sandwich is insanely tasty, both times we went.  My wife had the egg salad sandwich.  The second time we went, she had fairfax.  She liked the fairfax much more.  The service is slow because of the high demand.  However, it's totally worth it.  So much so, that we went twice in a 4 day period."}
{"text":"Basic at best. Definitely the most expensive breakfast sandwich I've paid for. I had the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. Restaurant was nice but this isn't something I'll come back for."}
{"text":"Tried \"the slut\" ($10) - It was SOO GOOD! 
Essentially it's a poached egg on top of a smooth potato purée in a glass jar topped with salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Before you eat it you have to mix all the ingredients in the jar to ensure all the flavor blends in together. Love it. Love the flavor, love the texture, and acts as a perfect dip to go with the baguette. Even though it looks tiny, it does get quite filling.

I wish I could have tried their other items! All their menu items just sounded so convincingly good - especially their egg sandwiches."}
{"text":"As an avid Vegas traveler, it can be very difficult to find an affordable food spot within the Cosmopolitan hotel because things can be either way too pricey or too far of a walk (I get lazy, ok??). Eggslut opening up is probably one of the best things that ever happened to the entire city of Las Vegas.

The line varies depending on what hour you get to the restaurant but overall, the line moves fairly fast. The menu offers a selection of sandwiches and other breakfast items at a price that's definitely competitive with other restaurants in/around the hotel. My regular order would be the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich - add avocado and ask for scrambled egg instead of sunny-side up...it's PERFECT. 

There is extremely limited seating space so don't expect to always find a seat so easily. It would be best to find a seating area within the hotel or bring it up to your room if seating is too crowded."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. I had the bacon, cheddar, egg sandwich which was delicious. My husband had the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. We both liked it so much that we went there 2 other times ordering the same thing (on different days of course). Make sure to get the fresh squeezed Orange Juice - so good!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the one in LA and since I stayed at Cosmo this Vegas trip, it was too convenient to not come here! Stopped by on Friday around 11AM and the line was looong! It reached to the back of the long corridor next to Eggslut. However, the wait went by quick, only about 20 minutes until I reached the cashier.

The Slut (10): I had to get this just for its name! Inside a tiny glass jar you get potato puree topped with poached-like egg and chives. You also get three slices of baguettes. It was so satisfying mixing everything in the jar. The end result tastes like delicious, very creamy smooth mashed potatoes! I think the price for this dish is a little steep...maybe you're paying for that glass jar? I don't know about you but I kept it!

The Fairfax (8): The perfect egg sandwich! Inside the well-buttered brioche bun, there are scrambled eggs, chives, cheese, onions, and sriracha mayo! This really hit the spot that I freaking inhaled it! I loved how fluffy my eggs were.

Eggslut has an exposed kitchen and you just see the hundreds of eggs they're cooking up, pretty cool! There's also very few seating, but no worries we just brought it back to our room. I can see how this can be so delicious after a night of clubbing too!"}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. Sandwiches. Ever.

Best thing I've had in my opinion is the Slut. It's so creamy and melts in your mouth (haha)

The name of the restaurant is already delicious"}
{"text":"My partner and I were excited to try out the menu yesterday because of the name of the restaurant, alone. The menu sealed the deal, and was at a fair price for the strip. We had prompt, accurate service. The food was good. We had the bacon and egg sandwich, which I enjoyed, although the chipotle ketchup was a little on the heavy-handed side, and was only in one side of the sandwich. The Slut was phenomenal. The potatoes were delicious, and I loved how the yolk brought it all together with the crunch of the crostini. The dining counter was definitely in need of a good wipe-down, which definitely took away from the experience."}
{"text":"Tasty eggs after a 3AM little John concert? Check!
Efficient use of their staff to manage lines out the door?  Check!
Serving with a smile and a fresh cup of Joe to get your day going? Check!!!
Fellow yelpers, this is one those restaurants to \"bookmark\" when in Vegas. 

You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"It was good but I'm only gonna give it 3 stars for the following reasons-
It's frikkin expensive even for Vegas. $4.50 for an 8-oz coffee was ridonkulous.
The slut's egg yolk was nearly hard, which didn't much mix well with the potato.  If you're gonna charge that much for it, the eggs better be perfect, and it was far from that.
So yeah, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"Eggs are normally not my thing, but Eggslut is   egg-cellent. 

Yes, the line is as lengthy as one you'd encounter at a popular nightclub. I think the wait is a part of the experience. Plus, it's always a good sign when you see a long line at a restaurant.

My friend and I ordered the Fairfax with Sausage ($11) and the Sausage Egg & Cheese ($8). The homemade turkey sausage was simply divine - savory with just a little heat. The brioche buns are nice and buttery too. Our breakfast sandwiches were so filling that we both skipped lunch.

Note: Use self parking near the east elevators. Eggslut is conveniently located on the 2nd floor as soon as you exit the elevator."}
{"text":"Trendy egg and bacon sandwich  for a high price.  Quality and taste was top notch.  Basically a stand in line,  order and go shop.  Only a few seats available.  Very pricey,  but you should try once."}
{"text":"The lines move quick and our food came out so fast! Would recommend the sausage or bacon egg sandwich - both so delicious! I also don't normally RAVE about coffee but their cold brew was so delicious and complimentary refills! Definitely worth the wait and not too expensive!"}
{"text":"I visited the Eggslut inside the Cosmo on a Thursday morning about 8-9am there was a line which moved fairly quickly. I don't think we waited longer than 10 minutes. My friend and I both had the Slut. 

The cage free coddled egg on top a bed of pureed potatoes with chives and grey salt on top.
It was served in a small glass jar ( it looks bigger in photos) placed in a recyclable container with 3 pieces of toasted baguette I think 4 or 5 pieces would be better but we gotta watch the carbs right? 

It was definitely pricey for breakfast.. I think $11 you only get one egg on top of the mashed potatoes. It was pretty decadent because of the yolk from the egg mixing into the warm buttery mash. Once I got to the bottom of the jar I was contemplating if it was box/instant mash potatoes because it sure did taste like some hungry jack. The breakfast sandwiches looked good from what I saw others order."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with myself for only coming here on the last day of our trip because Eggslut is amaaaazing!!!! 

I got the Fairfax ($8) - scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo on a brioche bun and added bacon ($3)! Suppppppper good.. probably the best egg sandwich I've ever had. 

Again, I really wish I would have tried this place earlier in my trip so I could have gone again - definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and tiny sandwiches.... like sleeping w a slut.  You don't tell your friends"}
{"text":"I don't know if I had my expectations too high for this place, but I found it pretty average for the most part.  I guess you must be paying a premium for the ingredients. 
Their signature dish \"The slut\" is more a novelty in presentation to me. Basically tasted like glorified mashed potatoes.  The bacon, egg, and cheese is exactly as stated and nothing amazing to write about.  Same is said for the pre-made biscuits they warm up under the broiler. For me,so far, the Fairfax sandwich is the star. I found it to be a nice blend of flavors,which I have no problems ordering each time I go.
Wait is hit or miss, I've been here when there is no wait and other times it is a far stretched line. However the line does tend to move pretty quickly. Seating it limited, which is unfortunate since the egg sandwiches can get kinda messy and a table top would be nice. 
I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area I'm up for it."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. Be sure to be ready for a wait. The line is deceiving as it wraps behind the store."}
{"text":"So let's be clear that this is NOT A RESTAURANT. It is more like back in your school days when you stood in line telling your lunch lady if you wanted the Jamaican patty or pizza. Not many options , $5 for a cold biscuit (reading the menu I thought it was a warm delicious biscuit), small coffee is another $5 orange juice $5, water $4. Came on a Monday and it's 30 min in line to order then another 25 min for then to prep your food. They yell out your name when its ready and you stand there shoulder to shoulder with other people waiting(after standing in line just to order ). I guess you can say I felt like a hen in a chicken coop.  

On a better note right out side of the chicken coop they have nice art work, unique chairs and table sitting, good music playing, and the huge chandelier great for a few pictures. The $9 egg cheese bacon sandwich was good but again small if you have a big appetite.

Way to be happier about being here is that if your in a group have one or two people in the Starbucks line getting better coffee and a side like banana bread and have someone else in the line at egg slut."}
{"text":"What a let-down.

Quick service is one nice thing I can say about Egg Slut.  Good sandwiches is another.  The rest is rather bad.

Prices are fairly high.  Sandwiches are a slightly-more-than-reasonable $7-$15.  The whole whopping two sides are $5.50 for a side salad (not terrible) and $4.50 for a cookie.  A cookie!

It doesn't stop there.  Want a small cup of OJ?  $5.  A bottle of Coca-Cola?  $5.  A cup of coffee?  $4.50-$5.  The markup on this stuff is insulting.

Also, there is one... ONE table.  16 chairs on one long bi-level table.  On our visit the entire table was taken over by one single family and two couples.  We had to eat our food standing in the hallway.  That is completely unacceptable.

The sandwiches are good.  Pretty much everything else at Egg Slut is pure crud."}
{"text":"Quite simply... Eggslut keeps breakfast sexy at any time of the day. Long wait or not, these guys can take my money without any resistance from me :) The new Vegas location delivered with zero disappointment."}
{"text":"The fresh OJ was good. Long line sucked but i understand everyone wanted to try this place. A lot of tourists mostly. There was an eating area in front of the place too, If you were fast enough to get the seat. Overall, the food made up the time for the wait."}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit overrated and that line you have to wait in just to get some breakfast is not what i feel like doing hungover. But the sandwiches aren't bad its just nothing special. Would i wait again probably not, i tried it and thats it."}
{"text":"Fairly small menu and the eating area is small too. 

My bf got the Gaucho Burger, which has wagyu beef. 5/5
I got the Slut, which is an egg over mashed potatoes with some slices of bread. 3/5 
It was wayyyyy too salty for my liking. :/"}
{"text":"Simple food required greater skillset to prepare.  This is by far one of the masters in preparing egg sandwiches and i highly recommend anyone to give it a try when you're around Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I was completely ignored for 20 minutes waiting for my order. I eventually got frustrated enough to confront the person 3 feet in front of who somehow didnt notice I was waiting for 20 minutes when I was the only one standing there. They eventually cooked my food and just shrugged and said sorry about that."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to. We were staying in Las Vegas for a day and decided to check this place out since it was recommended us by a friend. We definitely were not disappointed. Each of us ordered the \"Slut\" which was beyond amazing. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and coddled egg cooked to perfection. Plus the toast on the side with their butter (which had a touch of sweetness to it) just completed it. I also got the Fairfax sandwich with the turkey and avocado which was also amazing. Nestled in the bougie Cosmopolitan, it was a really great experience. The only downside was the line was very long, but it went by a lot quicker than we thought. I definitely would recommend going here!"}
{"text":"It's set up as an order counter and you pick up your food and grab a table or head out. We ordered the slut and the sausage egg and cheese- both were delicious but I'd say the slut was the clear winner! Very friendly staff- quick- pretty inexpensive for the strip- and very yummy food! Must try!"}
{"text":"I wish I had discovered this earlier in my stay at the Cosmo. There was a little bit of a wait but it was entirely worth it! I ordered a delicious cold brew coffee and the eggslut. It. Was. Amazing. I ordered extra baguette slices per someone's recommendation on here and it was perfection."}
{"text":"I LOVE an egg sandwich! This is a 3.5 Star 

Located in the 2nd floor on the other side of the fuschia chandelier center between Momofuku and Holstein's. Line wrapped around the corner. Arrived at 12:07p on a Tuesday. Food arrived at 12:30p. Plenty of seating for this time at lunch! 

Bacon, egg (still a bit runny), cheese $8.50. I added avocado (you get 1 thick slice) for $2 extra. $11.37 our the door. Bacon was amazing and crispy.  The flavor combo was on-point. The bun is where they fail. Soft, but also meant it got soggy quickly. The brioche has a bit more air bubbles making it not as uniformly fluffy. The texture was off from usual high end bakeries. I would prefer a touch more toasted for texture on the cut sides, it was barely toasted so the bread was not warm. It was cold within 3 minutes because the sauce is cold and avocado is cold, bread isn't warm. Also they make like 5-6 at a time (you can stand and watch) and mine was the first, so time from assembly to the pass allows for additional cooling. I'd like to try the fair fax, but with an additional bacon and avocado, it would be about $15 and that's not worth it!"}
{"text":"We happened to be at the strip at the opening day of this place and there was a line of people wrapped around waiting to get some. Se I knew it was a big deal.
Anyway we finally went last night to see what it was all about. 
I ordered the Fairfax with sausage, sauce on the side. My wife ordered the egg salad sandwich and she loved it. She also got one of their salted chocolate cookie. I tried some of that and it was dang good. 
They forgot to give me my sauce and it was a little pricey for what you are getting. They also don't have water cups and make you buy a $4 smart water which is so stupid to me. Those things stop me from giving a 5 star."}
{"text":"Not worth the popularity and incredibly big line at all. Street food is better than this sandwich. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the name because it brings a smile to my face each time I say it out loud. We came on an early weekday in December and the line was only a 5 minute.wait, thank goodness! I don't think I could wait in line for more than 30 minutes because the food isn't worth my patience. The staff was friendly and accommodating because it was slow and the Slut was pretty tasty. If only I had a little Tabasco or Crystals it'd been perfect.

The biscuit was dry and for 5 bucks, I wish they threw in some jam or something. Instead, they give you maple syrup and butter. The sandwich was ok and the sausage patty we added to it tasted like it was from a convenient store.

Overall, I don't think I'd be back on my own but it was a fun experience. Seating is limited to a few stools and a few feet away are sofas to lounge on."}
{"text":"I love Eggslut the food is always the same and tastes fantastic every time I visit! I went right when they opened on a Tuesday morning and the line was 5 mins maybe and the wait was so short which was great cause I had to catch my flight. The food was great and a must try wherever you find an Eggslut May it be in LA or LV!!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. My husband and father in law ordered the sausage egg and cheese sandwich on brioche and I had a bite of it. Egg was cooked medium so it was a little runny which was perfect! Good presentation. They took the time to make it look as described. I had the \"slut\" which was coddled egg over potato purée, sea salt and chives, served along with slices of a French baguette. The flavors were soooooo
Perfect. Although, my coddled egg was cooked a little medium, but I still loved it. Waiting 40 minutes for hour food wasn't really worth it, and the seating arrangements were pretty limited. I'm glad we came here. It's great to experience it once. And the food is damn good. I just wouldn't wait that long again."}
{"text":"The Slut is the bomb! I love how it's got the egg and potato purée... sooo delicious! Even though they give you 3 or 4 pieces of bread, you can always ask them for more bread without charging you, which I really appreciate.

I also tried the Gaucho sandwich, and it was really good, too!! I love the strips of steak, egg and arugula! Best breakfast sandwich ever!

Highly recommend coming here and you gotta try the Slut and Gaucho sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, eggs perfectly made. I had the bacon, egg and cheese and as greatly satisfied. Staff was friendly, even at 4AM with a line up"}
{"text":"Went here around noon on a Sunday and line was surprisingly short (about 10-15 minute wait).  Girlfriend and I both got the Fairfax with bacon because they were unfortunately out of sausage, as well as a biscuit and two salted chocolate chip cookies.  Fairfax was very delicious and bacon was top notch, but my girlfriends egg may have been slightly undercooked.  The biscuit was average, but the cookies were heavenly and had to hold myself back from getting more when I saw the line had cleared towards the end of the day.  

Overall.  Great quality food that may be slightly overpriced for what it is, but it's Vegas and in the Cosmo so it's to be expected."}
{"text":"Eggslut, you crack me up with the name. You're EGG-xactly what I'm looking for after an EGGshausting night in Vegas. You make me come out of my SHELL for the perfect morning after meal. Wham bam thank you ma'am. Eggslut, you are a genius, both in simple execution and location. They are conveniently located across from Marquee, so great for carbing up before turning up!

Fairfax sandwich: Soft scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, cheese and sriracha mayo in a warm buttery brioche bun. I added avocado to this deliciousness and was glad I did. This was such a simple yet tasty breakfast sandwich. So good, I got it two days in a row. For $10 a pop, its a little on the pricey side, but hey that's Vegas for ya. Ball out for this egg sandwich... you won't regret it. 

The line can be quite long during prime breakfast/brunch hours, but it moves quickly and service is fast here. Def worth checking out if you're staying at the Cosmo!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, who doesn't love eggslut? I had the Gaucho one day - deeeeeeelicious! Also had the fairfax another day, really good! Only thing that could be better is the line... you can wait forever on the line for eggslut!"}
{"text":"I AM A SLUT...Well an Egg Slut or at least a slut for Egg Slut !!! Las Vegas is known for a lot of things and yes people come for the gambling, shows and food. And it is sooooo worth it to come to Egg Slut... Every time I come I try a different menu item and have yet to be disappointed. Its just sooo good and after a night of party fun Egg Slut gets you back on your feet. XOXOXO to all us Egg Sluts male and FEMALE !"}
{"text":"I always get egg slut and cold pressed juice (also in Cosmo, on the same floor as egg slut) for breakfast when I'm in Vegas. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, but slut and gaucho sandwich (more like a burger tbh) are still my favs. Because they open during weird hours (12am - 7pm during weekend I think), you can also get it for late night after drinking & clubbing lol"}
{"text":"Ok, the food here is overpriced, but really is good.  The Slut is unique and so yummy. 
The service is not as good as the food. Ordered the Slut and the Sausage, Cheese, and Egg. The sandwich came out immediately send I was told the Slut will take just. Little longer. 15 minutes later it was ready. By then the sandwich was cold, the coffee was cold, and we were disappointed. How about ask if we want the items together as the Slit takes longer.  I don't mind waiting, but I want the entire party to eat hot food together.  With the price so high, the service should be impeccable."}
{"text":"I squeezed it too hard. The warm and salty goodness exploded and squirted into my face and hair.  I wasn't expecting it to burst so hard and fast. It totally missed my mouth, which had been trying to take in this behemoth.  Then it became soft, more limp, as it oozed the rest of its juices down my throat. I licked my lips and fingers. I wanted more. It was damn good and worth the 45 min wait leading up to the finish line. 

Are you an egg slut? someone who loves eggs so much, they can eat them all day, all night, wet, hard, coddled, easy and with everything. I am. I really enjoyed my cheeseburger with egg over easy on top for an early lunch.  Now I have to shower."}
{"text":"Bacon egg and cheese sandwich bomb.com. nice and worth the wait. Weekends it's about an hr wait weekdays I say 20 mins but soo worth it"}
{"text":"Everything breakfast should be. Worth the hype. Worth the lines. Fast and friendly service- can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"A must have place to eat. First time trying this place and it was so delicious. Located upstairs in the food court. Very popular and busy. Line was long but fast and friendly service. I will be back again. Poached egg over mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"Ooooh my! So yummy! I had the Fairfax and my husband and son both had the Goliath. We all enjoyed every bite. So fresh and the combination of flavors is perfection. The line was super long, but it moves quick. We found a cute table...(some of the chairs are shaped like eggs! Fun!)and our order was out in a jiff! May have to try the \"slut\" one day. That looked pretty good too. Eggcellent breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is all over social media with their photogenic, delicious looking breakfast sandwiches, so that was enough to draw me in. I arrived around 9am thinking maybe I'd beat the morning rush, but I guess people don't sleep late in Vegas (or at all)! The line wrapped around the corner and took about 30 minutes, but I was committed! I ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with avocado and a coffee, which came to $18. I don't see these prices as reasonable like a lot of other reviewers say, but I suppose that is subjective. My coffee was nearly $4, and I quickly realized I could have gone right next door to the Milk Bar and got a coffee for a fair price. But that's OK, I was ready to indulge in my once-in-a-lifetime breakfast sandwich. Once ordered, it took another 20 minutes or so. Needless to say, after almost a full hour, I was expecting an unbelievable sandwich. It certainly is beautiful, I'll give you that- a fluffy, glistening golden bun gently holds those pillowy eggs. So yeah, it was pretty good, but nothing mind blowing like I was expecting. For what it's worth, I enjoyed other breakfasts I had in Vegas much more than Eggslut. All in all, they offer pretty good food, and had there been a 10 minute wait and it didn't cost almost $20, I probably would have walked away feeling way better about it. I can finally say I've tried Eggslut, but I don't necessarily believe it's worth all the hype. But if I have the opportunity to try it again, I will do that to see if it pans out a bit better for me!"}
{"text":"Super wanted to love everything. I got the fairfax sooo tasty soft scramble eggs on point and the turkey sausage was really flavorful. Brioche tasted old maybe it was because it was 11 am? Spouse got the slut -- idk what the fanfare is about it tasted like baby food (would give it a 3/10). Poor guy was so hungry because the portion was so tiny. He was planning his next meal as soon as he saw the portion. Will try the LA location for sure just will not order the slut."}
{"text":"BOMB BOMB BOMB. I eat here almost every time I go to Vegas. It's amazing the one is LA is amazing. Check it out."}
{"text":"Aiiiiiiiiu, if one must go eggstatic over a sandwich, Eggslut is the place to gooooo.

Located right on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, this place is pretty easy to see due to the long long line of hungry people.

Made a quick stop here with my mom and we left feeling satisfied. For food, we ordered the Fairfax sandwich (which was a glorified scrambled egg sandwich with onions/chives/siracha sauce), fresh OJ and the dark chocolate cookie. 

OJ = fresh and .....orange :)

Cookie = KICK ASS COOKIEEEEEEE. You should try this if it's in stock since they do run out from time to time. Plus, your cookie gets heated up, so the melty chocolate is worth it.

Fairfax Sandwich = yummmmy. Eggs were so fluffy and light as a feather. In terms of taste, it was pretty good, especially the bread. Perfect for sharing if you're not too hungry. 

Pricing = priceyyy. It's Vegas....so $20 bucks for a meal wasn't too bad. 

Overall, this was a solid stop for breakfast/snack. If you don't see any seats at the nearby counter, don't fret! Just wander around and sit in the comfy lounge seats :D"}
{"text":"That little egg slut was delicious and too my surprise I didn't know, \"That Slut\", was here in Vegas at the Cosmopolitan! Must stop for breakfast location,Holy egg-asm it was yummy!"}
{"text":"I attempted to go to the Eggslut in La but the line was wayyyyyy too long so I was happy to see that Vegas line was do-able. 

Everything was exquisite! Hella good! I got a egg and bacon sandwich. The bacon was like REAL bacon, not that thin microwave stuff with a side of my favorite beer. Stella! 

They get you in and out and even have seats and tables for you to hang around. I loved this place and hate they don't have one in the bay. 

5 stars for Eggslut"}
{"text":"I paid $14 for a small egg sandwich and a coffee so let's bygones be bygones it's overprice by $5 and their coffee is bitter but for what is worth the eggs sandwich and their bread taste good, hence the 3 stars"}
{"text":"The food is just as alluring as the name is. I got the Fairfax, an egg sandwich with spicy cheese sauce. Perfect little spot for your breakfast fix if you're staying in the Cosmo, up for a walk or just a local like me. I can see this as a great handover fix or perfect to eat to pregame. I will say if you're counting calories or fat you may want to pass. When I left my napkins and fingers were butter soaked!"}
{"text":"The wait in the morning is about an hour.. I was able to leave my friend, run to Walgreens, shop, bring hr stuff back to our hotel at the Aria, and then walk back to Eggslut and my food was still being cooked. 

So if you go before 2PM... prepare to wait. 

The good news is that the wait was totally worth it. The slut... is so delicious! I could eat 5!"}
{"text":"Soft and delish! Orange juice was delish too , the perfect combo. Not heavy at all and  good for a quick pick me up."}
{"text":"Came here when they opened at 7am after my morning run and you'll be surprised by the line! I was hoping it would be a quick transaction but nope. Who wakes up this early as a traveler?! 

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich and the egg salad sandwich. The egg salad was pre-made, like tuna fish in a can, and scooped onto a toasted bun with arugula on top. I usually never eat egg salad because of the amount of mayo but this egg salad wasn't over bearing. Not something I would recommend for a list try. As for the Fairfax sandwich, it's hard to go wrong with the taste of eggs. The flavor wasn't anything spectacular and the bun were just toasted buns. 

What's with all the hype about this joint? There are better breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"The line and wait for an egg, sausage, and cheese sandwich was 30 minutes. Food wasn't that great. Sausage had no flavor."}
{"text":"I luckily stayed at the Cosmopolitan, so Eggslut was just an elevator ride away. It's been on my list for a while, so it was definitely a must for me when I visited. 

My friend and I split a sausage, egg, and cheese ($8) and the slut ($10). My friend personally liked the slut more, but I preferred the sandwich. For the price, I'd say the slut was an interesting taste to try, but it alone wouldn't have filled me up. I had a couple bites of the slut (phrasing?) and I would say that was enough for me. The sandwich was pretty solid and okay for the Las Vegas pricing in a nice hotel. 

Fair warning, there will be a long wait. When I went, I waited 30+ minutes to order. I would say that the food was solid, but not amazing enough to wait 30-45 minutes to order. I'd go again if the line was shorter. 

4/5 taste 
3.5/5 bang for buck"}
{"text":"Eggslut actually changed how we cook at home. We were told to go and try and eggslut and discovered that amazing world of sous vide cooking. I was skeptical that a runny egg with mashed potatoes could be this good and was so pleasantly impressed that we bought a sous vide to use at home to make the dish in our kitchen. The line can be intimidating at this small spot but don't let that deter you from getting your very own eggslut. The breakfast sandwiches are excellent as well but be brave and get the eggslut even if you don't think you'd like it, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Listen, I'm not one to easily drop $8.50 on a friggin' breakfast sandwich but if you see all the photos, you can tell  it's made with care.  Also, everything is expensive on the Vegas Strip so as one other Yelper commented, it's a better and tastier deal to eat here than at a typical sit-down spot.  I had the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and it was glorious.  The egg just exploded yolky goodness with the first bite (yeah, be careful, it can get messy).  

The coffee was okay.  It's $5 and nothing spectacular.  I'd suggest making use of the free in-room coffee at your hotel if you have that."}
{"text":"a great trendy eatery. food is great. cookies are great. drinks are great. 
detracted a star because there was no water (all that was offered was a fountain and $4 bottles), there was absolutely nowhere to sit anywhere (literally anywhere), and the price is literally exorbitant. order a fairfax with added avocado and bacon and an orange juice... almost $21. 
in addition the first couple days they were open they were out of at least 5 things on the menu but hey you're popular."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday morning and the line wasn't to long. I got the bacon egg and cheese and it was just what I expected... AMAZING! The prices are great in comparison to other breakfast places on the strip. I highly recommend trying this popular spot out. Friendly service, good food and reasonably prices, what else can you ask for?

The only complaint is the drink prices... $5 for a 12 oz OJ // $5 for a small bottle of smart water but hey how else are they going to pay the rent inside the Cosmo"}
{"text":"OMG - I wish I could have bought the whole Eggslut establishment back to Pittsburgh!

These guys need to expand *whispers - To Pittsburgh, PA.* I was hooked the moment I tried it. I went to Eggslut every morning I was in Las Vegas. Had the gaucho and the slut on multiple occasions. The gaucho was great every time I got it, but once. The meat was too overcooked, greasy, and very fatty the last time I got it. But hey- when you go as much as I did, it was bound to happen. I also had the slut a couple times, and it was AMAZING! 

The line is usually wrapped around the corner, but that is a compliment to their amazing food. When in Vegas thou shalt Eggslut!"}
{"text":"They had me at the name, honestly. 

Super sexy restaurant in the super sexy Cosmopolitan, situated across from the gorgeous Chandelier bar.  Hell yeah.

We were only in Vegas and we came here twice for the signature slut - a jar containing potato puree and an egg that is then boiled.  You stir the egg into the potato and then smear it on toast. So. Freakin. Good.  Especially if you order a side of bacon and crumble some of that in there too.  Or be truly disgusting and just smear the slut directly on to the bacon.

Hoping this chain makes its way to Denver ASAP.  I'm just disappointed that they were out of T-shirts in my size."}
{"text":"The prior reviews say it all. This place makes one hell of a breakfast sandwich. The bacon was perfectly crispy and the croissant was just right. One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"Been here twice and waited about ~45 minutes. Was it worth it? YES! This is the place to get some yummy breakfast before you start your day of drinking lol! It is located in the Cosmo hotel (second floor) by the pretty purple background that every girl wants to take picturesss with... ahem* me. :)

It's not too pricey but the slut sandwich is small so you might have to order 2..or 5! HAHA. I always get the fair fax sandwich w an avocado. YUM YUM! Saucy, flavorful and drippy! Also you can't get the sandwich without their orange juice! Be prepare to stand in line and there aren't many seatings. I believe the maximum of bar stools was 10?

Everyone wants to be a slut when they're in Vegas so def check this place out!"}
{"text":"The slut is a cool, unique item.  It's probably a 4/5 in taste, but it's not a big portion.   Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but it's not a place I'll be rushing back to."}
{"text":"Good and tasty, but the portion size is small and the queue can take 30 minutes during lunch time"}
{"text":"I was skeptical on whether this place was going to be good or not and wondered just how good a breakfast sandwich could really be.  Decided to see what all the hype was about. Boyfriend and I were in vegas and walked over to the cosmopolitan hotel from vdara for breakfast and waited in the long line. It was okay though because it went by fast. I got the sausage egg and cheese, and bf got the guacho (has steak), and the slut (egg in the cup). We were completely blown away by how good it was and I can't really explain why it was so good. The buns were soft, the steak and arugula complimented the sandwich so well and the sausage egg and cheese just melts in your mouth. You can really tell that they take the time to prepare each thing on the menu to taste just right."}
{"text":"It's about 9:30am on a Saturday and the line is all the way back to the bathrooms. I overheard someone saying it's about a 45 min wait from where we are. I didn't expect it to be this busy so early, but #Vegas. Will update post when I get to the promise land!

Update: 

Time: 
Finally got my food! From the back of the line, to ordering my food, to receiving it equated to about 45 mins!

Food: 5/5
Food was excellent. The \"egg slut\" is small so you may want to order more food if you're hungry like I did. I recommend the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. 

Nice to have:
Drink/cocktail to sip on while you wait in line."}
{"text":"I would have loved to tried this place.  Unfortunately, the line was always long and always extremely slow.  For having a very limited menu, why are your workers so slow.  I stood there watching just the workers and they were just taking their sweet time.  

When the line gets long, they should have a person taking orders in the line so that the cooking staff can make orders in bulk.  Your making eggs only 3 ways, scrambled, poached, and over medium. 

Look a chipotle and five guys (Virginia firm), the lines are long there too but it moves.  I get they have a captive audience but no egg sandwich is worth waiting 45+ mins for.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! Bryan and I came here 3 times, twice in one day.

On our first visit, there was no line around 1pm on a Saturday! (Line got longer after us) I got a turkey sausage eggwich ($8). It was slightly above average. Sausage, egg, and brioche buns were fresh. Honey mustard aioli was tasty. They ran out of sluts, so we knew we had to come back...

The next day! There was a 15-20 min line around 12:30pm. Omg they were out of sluts again... but I was really happy with my gaucho sandwich ($15). The wagyu beef was so tender and juicy! It's a lot of meat--very filling. I highly recommend going for this one.

Later at 6pm, we were determined to get our slut ($10). Hallelujah they had it! We broke the yolk and dipped our baguettes. Super yummy! The potato purée and coddled egg were the best combination. I love eggs and potatoes so this item was made for me. The mason jar (they reuse them so don't throw them away) was cute. I'm glad we finally got to try it before leaving Vegas :)

Suggestions for improvement:
-Serve water cups
-Make more sluts so you don't run out"}
{"text":"Had a midnight snack at eggslut in the Cosmo, and I ordered the potato purée and poached egg in a glass jar and it was the perfectly sized snack for me. 

The potato purée went so well with the egg, really surprising at how good those two went together. It was topped with chives and some sea salt. My only complaint is that there was a bit too much salt, and I had already mixed it all in. I wish there was an option to add shredded bacon to it, that is the only way it could've been improved upon. 

It also came with three or four small slices of toasted and buttered baguette. So good!"}
{"text":"Waiting for a conference to start one morning, I was a little early and wanted to find something to eat at the Cosmo.  The wife (M) and I walked by Eggslut and saw a line down the hallway.  \"Must be pretty good if people are willing to wait that long for it,\" M remarked.  We walked around looking for something with a shorter line, but couldn't find anything we really wanted, so we got in line.

30 minutes later, we finally ordered a Slut and a Gaucho. And we weren't disappointed. 

I've never been so impressed with a Slut before, but this one had me wishing I could eat Sluts over and over again. My wife just about pushed me out of the way so she could eat my Slut. I begged her to let me take another Slut home, but she said no. Oh well. 

Eat a Slut and be happy."}
{"text":"Get the fairfax add bacon and avocado. I'd suggest a michelada and a biscuit. Make sure you get honey butter."}
{"text":"Great food for a fitness walk, \"modified\", that is.  Friendly staff, smiles all around."}
{"text":"Eggslut is the greatest breakfast place i have found on the strip. The sandwiches are phenomenal and the biscuit and honey butter is out of this world.
Don't forget to add avocado to ur sandwich. It's so worth the money. Originally i was hesitant to spend so much money on a simple egg sandwich but it is 100% worth it and since i am a local i will def be back. It's pretty much my favorite place  only negative is being a water bottle,
They charge u 5$ plus for water."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place.

The fairfax was the bomb. Make sure you add a side of bacon in it. It was so fluffy and moist-everything you want in a perfect scramble egg.

The egg and bacon was good, however it cannot top the fairfax. 
Cookie- decent

Just get the fairfax with bacon and you'll be pretty happy. A great place to go after the club. The lines can get pretty crazy around 4am though."}
{"text":"Ugh.  What was I thinking?  How could I not pick up that Slut?

Besides the fact that it's their signature item (which is reason enough on its own), I can't help but think of all of the different lines/jokes I could've used in my review...

\"I saw this hot looking Slut in Vegas\"
\"This (food) whore picked up a Slut at Cosmo\"
\"For breakfast, I ate this Sl-...\"

Okay, you get the picture.  With a name like that, the jokes practically write themselves!  All of that having been said though, my thought process actually made perfect sense at the time - the Slut alone wasn't going to satisfy my wants (ha!), but I wasn't hungry enough to get that and something else.  Plus, I'd be lying if I said it was the most appealing dish on their menu; all of their sandwiches, as well as their cheeseburger, sounded so much better!

After waffling back and forth on which of their breakfast sandwiches to get, I ultimately decided to go with their SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE SANDWICH ($8.95).  Filled with a House-made Turkey Sausage, Cage-free Over Medium Egg, Cheddar Cheese, and Honey Mustard Aioli on a Brioche Bun, this thing looked and smelled so good, I started to salivate (my photo doesn't do it justice) - https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggslut-las-vegas?select=JdSBqc90mbOWGr0o67mubQ

Unsurprisingly, given their specialty, I thought the egg in the sandwich was great - pillowy and perfectly cooked.  Both the cheese (yum!) and sausage (meaty, juicy) were pretty good as well, but I personally would've preferred a pork sausage patty.  As for the bu n, it was both good and bad.  While I liked how it tasted and how airy/soft it was, I feel like its buttery/greasy texture gave it a weird mouthfeel.  Either that or I'm just too used to the English muffins that Starbucks and McDonald's use).

Since I've never been to any of their locations in SoCal, I can't say how this one compares in regards to size, taste/quality of food, or prices (though I imagine it's a bit pricier here).   However, even though I wasn't quite as mesmerized as I had hoped I would be, I'm still stoked to have finally tried Eggslut and would definitely come back.  Maybe not when the line stretches to a 30-45 min wait, but 15-20?  That's not so bad to walk out with that Slut everyone talks about."}
{"text":"After a pretty long wait we got to experience Eggslut. For me it was worth the wait. 

I had the Slut because I've been dying to try it. Puréed potato topped with a soft egg and chives. Served with toasted slices of baguette. Very simple sounding ingredients that together blend into something so delicious. 

My 2 eating partners had the gaucho sandwich, one with gluten free bread. They both devoured them. 

Stop by for breakfast if staying at Cosmo or elsewhere on the strip. Just be prepared to wait in line depending on when you come."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a coworker and boy it has not disappointed. They've got something for everyone here. The flavors are spot on! It's now a place I need to visit every time I'm here in Vegas. The lines are long but they move fast. Trust me...The line is worth the wait!! I recommend their Slut item. By far the best Item on the menu. Ask for extra baguette and add a side of bacon if you need a meat item."}
{"text":"Like any top-tier slut, eggslut is fast, casual, discrete, high quality, and hangs out in the right part of town. Sure, it feels and looks a little like an airport restaurant, and you can tell tons of people go in and out in no time, but the goodies are worth sharing. The steak and egg brioche sandwich is not to be missed, and this is one of the easier, cheaper ways to get that afternoon delight."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Grand Central Market in LA and loved it, so was eager to check this one out since its opening. Came here around 2 in the morning for a snack and ordered a cheeseburger. The wait was quite a while, for it was pretty busy at this time... Was with a friend and the food was under his name. Apparently they had misspelled his name and mispronounced it, so we had to go up to them and double-check on why he hasn't been called. Figured out the confusion and finally got our food. The quality of the burger compared to the one in LA was much lower. It was drier and tasted less fresh...as if the patties have been sitting out elsewhere for a while. While trying to finish the burger, there seemed to be a conflict between a customer and the staff at the counter...causing the customer to leave angrily without her food, and the staff reacting in an extremely unprofessional and rude manner. The fact that this place is open almost 24 hours, on the Strip, in front of Marquee nightclub, says a lot about the service and apparently the food quality. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"This place is very fun and energetic. The food is delicious and the orange juice is fresh and tastes awesome! However, seating is a problem and the line can get very long. The staff definitely makes an effort and tries to move the line as quick as they can!"}
{"text":"One of the best egg sandwiches breakfast places. I tried the one in Grand Central Market and that was delicious. So happy they had one in Vegas. The way the eggs are cooked melts in your mouth. I had the bacon sandwich and the chipotle ketchup is a perfect sensation. It kinda makes the flavors pop.  It is a little pricy and the lines are long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Was visiting from Florida on vacation and read and heard great things about this place. There was a HUGE line at around 11 am , but you know what.... it WAS WORTH IT. Best breakfast  sandwich I have EVER HAD.  I ordered the \"Fairfax\" which is scrambled eggs, chives, sriracha mayo & caramelized onions on a brioche bun. I was speechless when I bit into it. I'm just so mad I had to leave back to Florida after . Will definitely go again, don't let the lines deter you! Worth the wait x100"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Eggslut to the point of making it a requirement because we were traveling to the West coast! We waited in a SUPER LONG line at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas and finally got to the counter to place our order. I got a Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwich and my partner got a Fairfax Sandwich which has caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. We both shared a biscuit which is served with very creamy butter and syrup. The food was good... but i personally felt I could have received the same exact thing at say.. McDonalds! When we initially found out about Eggslut we were rather excited because it seems a different approach was being taken on serving eggs to provide a unique or different texture. What was served was an average egg sandwich!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast sandwich! I ordered the Fairfax which was the perfect size and popping with flavor. I also ordered the arugula salad to accompany the sandwich and even though it was simple, it was a great pairing! Beware of the burger...not because of any flavor, but rather of \"how\" you eat it. I had a friend bite into it and the soft egg shot all over the place. Will visit again for sure! =)"}
{"text":"Let's talk about this SLUT. It's ahhhhmazing. I was hesitant to get it because it's Ten bucks but was worth every penny. Cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see eggslut in LV after trying the one in LA.  The line wasn't too bad compared to the one in Grand Central Market.  After about 20 mins, we got to the front.  Tried the sausage sandwich, which was somewhat disappointing.  I was expecting a fluffy egg like prior but it was just a regular sunny side egg.  The bread was good as usual.  Next time, i'll stick to the Fairfax.  There was also quite a wait after ordering to receive your food, which was not unexpected as they are made fresh and to order.  Seating is hard to find so you'll probably end up sitting near the bar/common seating area or getting it to go."}
{"text":"Delicious but damn that line.... can you guys put two people on the register? I've been here an hour and there's only been one cashier posted up. 

Love: fairfax sandwich with sausage 
Dislike: egg salad sandwich (no flavor and Uber bland)"}
{"text":"Everything here was great. I personally had the slut and despite its small size it was very filling. Several in my group had the breakfast sandwiches and raved about them as well.
Some would say it is pricey, but you are in Vegas and it is the cosmo. So good I will go back"}
{"text":"First off let me just say that I originally wanted to try this place because 1 my wife and I love breakfast sandwiches and 2 I saw eggslut on first we feast's FB page.  I'm not going to lie the line almost made me change my plans please listen to me the line moves really fast do not be scared I almost effed up royally.  I knew I was going to go with the fair fax because that is the dish I saw Chef Cailan making on Facebook my wife had the egg slut (coddled egg with mashed potato and bread) more on that in a min. Here is the lowdown
1. Fairfax sandwich (had mine with bacon) delicious perfect egg nice cheese amazing bun but really egg sandwiches are either good or not 
2. The egg slut OMG this was amazing while I was very happy with my fairfax I was pretty jealous of my wife's mix the egg up with the potato and it makes this custard like sauce to spread over the bread that is so good we went the next day so I could get my own and I will now be trying to make this at home.
3. Orange juice delicious with perfect amount of pulp 
Eggslut please please come to my home town of Denver 
*pro tip the food court in Caesar's palace has choulula packets smuggled a few over for my slut I'm just saying"}
{"text":"When I found out there was an egg slut in Vegas, I was out of this world excited. I had an amazing experience with the egg slut in LA, so I thought I would be going to egg slut every day I was in Vegas! However, although my sausage, egg and cheese sandwich was good, it didn't live up to my expectations and experience from LA. It was the same sandwich I had but it just wasn't as great. The sausage didn't have as much flavor. The egg was a little over. The bread was a bit stale. I don't know, it just didn't live up to the standards I had expected from LA. Don't get me wrong, it was still a good breakfast sandwich but it wasn't all that I remembered it to be. 

I also tried the slut this time around and I'm not sure I get the appeal. It didn't taste anything special to me."}
{"text":"Go figure - We are from Los Angeles, where three+ EggSlut locations stand, yet we have never visited an EggSlut until now in Vegas. But hey -  a first for anything and damn, these are amazing sandwiches!

We ordered two sandwiches: 
Fairfax: fluffy delicious scrambled eggs, chives and caramelized onions, with thick slice of ooey gooey cheddar, lathered with sriracha mayo all packed between toasted, soft, amazing brioche buns! Delicious sandwich, we just wish there were more onions! 

Sausage, Egg, and Cheese: surprisingly delicious turkey sausage, nicely seared, great seasoning and spice of flavor, soft meat, on top of an over-medium egg which EXPLODED with yolk all over my hands and plate (I LOVE that) oh so sexual I know, a thick slice of cheddar, with honey mustard aioli in that amazingly delicious brioche bun! I should have ordered a biscuit to scoop up the yolk!

Both of these sandwiches were absolutely amazing! Delicious bun, perfectly cooked eggs in each, delicious sausage, lovely sauces to accompany the sandwiches, and overall just a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"The line was ridiculously long (stood in line for a solid 30-40 mins) and the wait time for the food to cook was an additional 10-15 minutes but that is the price you have to pay for quality food that you can only get at limited locations. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with an addition of turkey sausage & avocado. My sandwich cost came out to be $13.50. I'm big on sauces so I asked for some sauce on the side to add to the Fairfax & it tasted bomb! 

Side note: There is seating available for those who wanted to dine by the area. It's indoors located in the Cosmopolitan hotel. Be prepared to set aside 1-2 hours of your day for this place (mainly due to the wait time)."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in this place. It did not live up to the hype. Waited an hour for a cold sandwich and under cooked biscuit. They replaced the biscuit thankfully. I didn't receive my OJ and when I went to go ask the expo she said she would get it in a moment then started to text on her phone... The sausage sandwich was underwhelming but the bacon was better. Buns were cold. The whole staff just had a lack of smiles. Over all would not go again. Giving two stars because the fully cooked biscuit was actually delicious. Will not go again. Not worth wait or prices."}
{"text":"Really good Egg,Bacon and Cheese Sandwich.... $8.65 ! Rather have a slut than an expensive burger Las Vegas Strip..."}
{"text":"Finally... Finally had the (egg)slut. My last trip to Las Vegas we had stayed at The Cosmopolitan and the location was still under construction but said opening soon. Fast forward 3 months and YES, a slut is born. I've always wanted to try the OG Eggslut at Grand Central Market in Downtown LA but I've been trying to avoid the long crazy lines. Not that this one located across the way from Marquee on the 2nd floor doesnt have crazy lines of their own. We wanted to go there at lunch right before going to the day club and the line must have been at least 100-150 people deep. CRAZY! I ended up going after the day club and there was no line at all so it worked out.

I went with the bacon, egg & cheese on a strong suggestion from my friend that had it the previous morning for breakfast. It was great. It was served up on a really good brioche bun served warm but it had cooled down a bit since I walked it back to my room. The sammich came with a good amount of delicious smoked bacon, an over-medium egg, cheddar cheese and ketchup with a kick. I really liked it. The combination of flavors made for the perfect breakfast style sandwich. The runny egg was great. The bacon was smoked niceness. The cheese was tasty. The sammich had good flavor and filled you up enough as a small meal unto itself.  

Service was super friendly. Appreciated that. The cashier's son had a similar name to mine so we had a pleasant convo about names/nicknames. He made sure the bottled water I got was super cold and the lady that retrieved it for me was nice enough to find the coldest one and to also bag my sandwich because I forgot to mention it was to-go.

I will certainly go back to Eggslut again the next time I'm at The Cosmopolitan. I def wanna try the famous slut... They're opening one in Glendale so it might be time to finally be a regular and hit all the highlights on their menu."}
{"text":"Yes.... I am an Eggslut !
Our first morning we were still on Detroit time so we hit the new Eggslut location just after opening, no wait for some excellent breakfast dining. 
We shared a Fairfax with bacon and the Egg and Turkey sausage sandwich. Both excellent. 
Filled us for the day.
We were going to repeat on our last morning, a little later wake up time and the line was way way long. 
Excellent addition to the resort"}
{"text":"The first morning that we attempted to eat here in the Cosmopolitan, the line was so long. Obviously, there is a reason for this: the food is amazing. We went back to second morning and were not disappointed! We waited in line for about 25 minutes, then waited another 10 after we ordered. Though there are few tables at the Eggslut, there are other options for seating around on the hotel. We had an exceptional nice server who took our order. Coffee was kind of expensive for such a small amount, but I didn't want to stand in another extremely long line at Starbuck's. 
There is an Eggslut in LA too."}
{"text":"This place was me and my girlfriend's first stop after checking into our hotel. My first impressions about this place is that it must be very good because the line was really long. 

I got the cheese, egg, & sausage sandwich while my girlfriend ordered the fairfax sandwich & a slut. My sandwich came out delicious. My girlfriend's fairfax sandwich was perfection, the egg was very fluffy & melted in my mouth. The slut was interesting, egg on the top & mashed potatoes in the bottom, which includes slices of bread.

Overall, I enjoyed my breakfast here, I don't mind coming back here whenever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place was right next door from my hotel so it wasnt much a far walk from Aria to Cosmo. The line was pretty long when we got here, but it was worth it. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich along with a Modelo Chelada and it was a fantastic combo! I loved the chipotle sauce as well and to top it off, service was great! I will most definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"The cheese burger is just oh so slutty. The yolk is amazing. The bread was scrumptious. The food is amazing. Good job."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Eggslut since it's food truck days in LA, and then when the location in the Grand Central Market opened, I became a regular there as well. Now that the vegas location has opened, it has been my casual breakfast/brunch go-to spot. 

Yes, the queue is long. Yes, there's a lot of hype about this place. Yes, the hype is worth it. The key is going during off hours (if you can). From my experience, off-hours include weekdays not during breakfast or lunch. I know, I know - this is a breakfast/brunch spot, but if you have a flexible schedule or don't mind waiting in the queue for 20-30 minutes, then you're all good. 

I've tried all of their breakfast sandwiches, burger and fresh squeezed OJ. I have zero complaints about any of their items except that the OJ is so good that I end up drinking it in 3 large sips or less. 

To some, their price point may seem high for an egg sandwich ($8) and OJ ($5), but if you compare it to a sit-down restaurant, it's actually much lower (and much better tasting).

I'll never turn down the option of going there, I'm a fan for life."}
{"text":"Came here I'm my last trip to Vegas after multiple people had recommended it. We got there on a Friday morning around 1030 and the line was around the hall, wait took about 20 minutes to order. My sandwich I got was yummy but messy to eat. There wasn't any seating available so my friends and I sat on a bench together. The reason I gave three stars was because of the lack of seating and wait, for how popular the place is they should invest in more tables ."}
{"text":"I have been craving for trying this place for quite some time.  If you haven't tried this place yet, you are missing out.  Their Slut tastes incredibly good and it leaves you wanting more. 
Also be sure to try their Bacon and Cheese Sandwich.  It tastes very good especially with the egg yolk running down your fingers while you take a bite.  
Waiting in line for over twenty minutes is worth it."}
{"text":"@eggslut @cosmopolitan_lv 
This place is legit! Not the healthiest but not the worst. #Eggs are supposed to be rather magical for the diet. #Crossaint
and #Cheese not so much. #Coffee is also a plus. So 2 pluses and 2 or 3 negatives. Worth it."}
{"text":"When I saw a restaurant called 'Eggslut' I knew I needed to go there. Needless to say, the next morning my friend and I found ourselves in a long line waiting for our eggslut treats! I had debated getting their (possibly signature) dish that features an egg inside a glass jar with potato puree BUT talked myself out of it at the last minute and got their breakfast sandwich with bacon, an over medium egg, and some caramelized onions. Lucky for us, my friend and I got a free egg sandwich coupon while we stood in line, so we each only paid about 5$ ( can't complain about that). The sandwiches, however, were a little disappointing. They make all of their eggs ongoing in anticipation of people ordering them and then they assemble the sandwiches as they are ordered. This would be fine, except the sandwiches are never heated through again, leaving the premade eggs/bacon/ etc to be cold with the cheese not even being melted on the sandwich. What a bummer. I think the flavor of the food was good, but it needed to be thrown under their salamander for a minute to get the gooey melty cheese goodness that is essential to a great egg sandwich (IMO). Also...they had no salt and pepper out....so weird for an egg place. I would still consider a return visit, maybe they'll work these kinks out as the restaurant gets older."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast. Long line but it went fast. Food was served quick and hot. Got the gaucho sandwich which was awesome"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out this place for so long in LA but never got the chance to. On Friday before my flight, the day of the grand opening I knew this was a chance for me to indulge in all egg bacon goodness as much as I could. I ordered the sausage egg and cheese...and added bacon and avacado. 

It was one of the best things I've ever eaten. After everyone raving about this place, I did not expect for it to be THAT good. 

Those who are complaining about the price- what do you expect? It's VEGAS. 
It was worth the wait and the price. I will definitely be back again!

It was egg-cellent ;)"}
{"text":"07:15 on a Saturday and there is still a line at Egg Slut. Ordered the Fairfax and it was quite enjoyable. Soft and slightly sweet brioche bread, generous scrambled egg with a nice Sriracha mayo. Would enjoy eating this again but I wouldn't bother if the wait is 30 minutes or more."}
{"text":"Amazing! Loved everything we ordered \"the slut\" & the egg salad sandwich. Everything was delicious and I appreciated that this is one of the few restaurants that aren't \"sit down\" or \"fast food\" but somewhere in between..... which is hard to find on the strip!  The wait to order was about 15 minutes but once u order the food comes quickly!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after having my friends rave about this place. They are fast and efficient but lines are long! We had them as a before dinner snack and it was satisfying. The \"slut\" is a poached egg in a glass jar with potato purée and cheese, the baguette slices were nice and crispy. It was a nice little snack and I saw other items on the menu that I wanted to try too. Lines are very long in the morning, after 12 pm, there's no line at all. Definite must when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The place was decent. Fairly overpriced for eggs but it food was still good.

You can taste the quality of the eggs which is great! But I think this place was a bit overhyped...

At least it's safe to say that I can check it off my list."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the long line went quickly.  However..... no excuse for poor treatment.  We went to the EggSlut in Vegas at The Cosmopolitian.

Most of the seating is far from where the food comes out.  You have to listen for your name.  When our order came up (signature slut) my name was called but the other half of meal was not ready.  They wanted me to take what was ready and keep coming back to check on rest of order.  

I explained I would just wait for both food items so we could eat together.  Weird.... I guess I was considered a problem person for ask for this because others got their bacon sandwiches before me!  I waited patiently 5 min to get 2 items so my husband and I could eat TOGETHER.  :("}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Tuesday around 2pm, and there wasn't a line at all. We each ordered a fairfax, and I got a fresh-squeezed orange juice, while he got a coffee. The sandwiches were rather yummy but a little too greasy for my taste. I thought that everything was a bit overpriced. I understand that it's Vegas, but it didn't quite seem worth all of the hype and money. It is nice, however, that it is a reliable breakfast stop when you're not in the mood to have lunch food in the afternoon and don't want to sit somewhere for too long."}
{"text":"Three times the charm to line up earlier. Ordered the egg, bacon and cheese sandwiches, honey buttermilk biscuit and salted chocolate chip cookie. All delicious I'm not a fan o salted sweeties but their cookie had a touch of it which is enough to taste the salt without overwhelming the sweet. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Long line but worth it is the moral of the story. Don't expect to get in and out of Eggslut quickly but do expect to walk away blown away and satisfied. 

We came at 11:30 AM and waited in line until 12:15. We ordered and had our food in hand by 1230. The wait is pleasant, you're able to watch the chefs cook.

We tried a number of items -

Slut - Creamy, Rich, tasty. Served in a jar it comes with a couple of pieces of toasted French baguette. Not ideal to carry out because it's messy but not to be missed.

Gaucho - Really good. The steak was cooked really well. The chimichurri sauce was an excellent complement. The egg was perfectly done and broke as soon as you bit into it. The bread was fluffy and Rich.

Fairfax - A little spicy but nothing crazy. Scrambled eggs with spicy sauce cheese and arugula. 

Egg, Cheese and Sausage - really good in a croissant bun. Very bht

Egg and Cheese with Spicy Ketchup - even my picky sister who wasn't hungry demolished it."}
{"text":"Good, quality ingredients. Food is good. Line was long but moved quickly. I didn't give 5 stars because it's Very expensive for what you get. Sandwich prices weren't too bad but $5 for a tiny cup of OJ is ridiculous. We spent $37 on breakfast for 2. Worth a try but definitely couldn't make it a habit for the price."}
{"text":"There is always a long line at Eggslut in LA, so it was so nice to run into this place a few minutes before it closed--no line!

I got the sausage, egg, and cheese and it was egg-cellent! I firmly believe that all burgers and sandwiches are infinitely better with a broiche bun and the one I got was egg-ceptional. I always wondered how an egg sandwich got be so hyped, but I have to say it's pretty egg-traordinary.

Looking for a tasty, quick bite? Eggslut is egg-actly what you need."}
{"text":"Yummmmyyyyyyy first of all!!!! 
Fats clean. 
Would definitely hit this spot when I'm in Vegas again. So good for after pool party."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.

Eggslut's original location is in Los Angeles. I was intrigued when I saw Alvin Cailan on YouTube create a scrumptious looking breakfast sandwich featuring King's Hawaiian Bread, grilled Spam, egg and chives. It looked amazing!

Fast forward a year later, I heard that he opened another Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas. I specifically came here for \"The Slut\": an ingenious twist on a coddled egg, served over mashed potatoes, sprinkled with gray salt and chives. It's served up with a few thinly sliced baguette slices and is presented in a mini mason-esque jar. I loved this but the portion is ridiculously tiny! Regardless, I enjoyed it but for $10 for a teeny portion, I was expecting a bit more. Next time I will try one of the breakfast sandwiches as they looked a bit more substantial.

Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed, which bummed me out because I wanted to love this place.   I shall give the LA location another try...we'll see what happens!"}
{"text":"Long line that promised ah-mazing breakfast options turned out to be long line to order, long wait for breakfast, and mediocre experience. Of all the restaurants at The Cosmopolitan this one is certainly well priced, but it didn't deserve the hype. We ordered the Bacon, egg and cheese and Egg Salad sandwich. Both brioche buns were super dense and could have been half as \"bready\". It took away from the sandwich. Egg salad was missing flavor, but the arugula garnish was well dressed. Bacon, egg and cheese was just basic and also lacking flavor. The menu items look fantastic, but overall, missing that key seasoning/flavor ingredient. Won't be going back during our stay."}
{"text":"Eggslut has been on my list in Vegas for a while. My fiance and I walked over in the early morning and there was still a wait. Worth it, I think we waited maybe 20 minutes? The line ended up growing behind us.

Fiance got a breakfast sandwich. I didn't even get to taste it! I ordered the slut. This was so good. It's an egg in a mason jar with mashed potato, sounds like such a simple dish. Sounds like a dish you can recreate at home... but can you?? I forgot to ask for extra baguette slices to eat with the slut. GET EXTRA BREAD WITH YOUR SLUT!!

I didn't realize that the slut is ready in batches. If they have some for you, definitely grab one... or two... or three."}
{"text":"Good, but not outstanding.  There was no line when we went, but later in the morning and in the weekend, the lines were really long.  Hubby and I each had a different kind of egg sandwich.  Both were good, but seemed only kind of warm, and maybe premade.

Again, they were tasty, but not good enough to seek out again."}
{"text":"We had the slut which was amazing!  If you like creamy mashed potatoes this is a must try!

I also had the steak sandwich (can't remember the name). It had a bit of a kick but was cooked to perfection and had very good flavor."}
{"text":"Fairfax sandwich is really good, the eggs are delicious but I do have to say that the sandwich needs less salt/butter because it was pretty salty. Would come back but next time I'll order the slut."}
{"text":"Got the Sausage egg and cheese sandwich and it was messy goodness! Flavor was of the dressing was perfect. Only bad part was that it fell apart."}
{"text":"Sausage egg and cheese sandwich ($8.50) 
* house made turkey sausage, over medium egg, cheddar and honey mustard aioli on a brioche bun

Slut ($10.50)
* coddled egg on top of potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with grey salt and chives served with toasted baguette. 

- So, so good. There was a long line-up but it was worth the wait. The sandwich was tasty. I like the seasoning on the house made turkey sausage and the aioli. The must order is the Slut - the egg was perfectly cooked in sous vide which kept the yolk in a custard texture. The grey salt and chives finishes it well. Mix it all together and top it on the baguette and you'll have a perfect bite"}
{"text":"I came here for the second time and it was still just as great! You really have to try their Slut! But also get a breakfast Sandwich cuz those eggs are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Eggslut is a pretty cool concept, but just like the LA location this place is honestly more hype than it is good... I'm still not sure what the appeal is at this place, but hey, who am I to judge. That being said, this particular location yields some pretty friendly service and very consistent food. The egg sandwiches here are as expected, a bit on the small side and a bit on the expensive side just like the rest of this place. But I will tell you that after a long night out, Eggslut sounds pretty freaking delicious and the location is near perfect. Overall, good in a pinch, but if you want something more than just hangover food, this may not be the place. 

Pros-
Great location (within Cosmo)
Consistent product 
Friendly service 
Great OJ 
Simple menu 
Not crowded in the morning 
Great hangover grub 

Cons-
Very crowded most of the time, long lines
Somewhat small portions 
Lots of hype 
Very limited seating"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The lady who's handing out the orders was able to make remake my biscuit since I received it very cold. The egg and bacon sandwich was outstanding! The OJ was great as well. Highly recommend this place and FYI the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Eggslut lets me be proud of my inner dirty slut at brunch time and for that, bravo.

I'm unwilling to say this will be the best breakfast sandwich you will ever have in your life. I am willing to say it's a good one on the Vegas strip. I'm also willing to say you will wait in line for it. I got the sausage (subbed in the siricha mayo). It's drippy, meaty, saucy goodness. I'd ask for extra mayo because that's the only way to live your best life.

I'm shocked to say this, but I'd actually recommend the Slut which is a coddled egg (BTW, I have no slutty idea what a coddled egg is but I'm fairly certain the dude I met last night wanted to try that move on me). Break the yolk, mix, and lather on bread. It's buttery, rich, and delicious.

Ps, went with two friends/coworkers who wanted a shout out. Hi Matt and Scott."}
{"text":"Well I was supposed to be on a diet but i guess it was cheat day because i ate here LOL. Ill say right now its definitely not a spot for locals! But my sister was in town so we went to try it. I liked it but I would never go out of my way to come back. I really liked their brand like the employee shirts were based off of nirvana & they had hip hop music blasting and i even like the name eggslut lol. As for the food I really liked how on the menu they talked about the ingredients and where the bread came from and alla dat. Prices were not bad considering its a popular food place AND its on the strip. It ranged from $8-$15. I got sausage, egg, and cheese for $8 and im glad i tried it but it didn't change my life like i thought it was going to.          I can see why people like this place but I am not a fan. 4 stars because the line was outrageous and there wasn't really anywhere to sit and eat. I lowkey should have just sat in my car and ate instead of walking around to find someplace and dealing with all of the tourist. I guess i would recommend eggslut to people visiting vegas but FIRST i would tell them about to secret pizza @ cosmo bc its so bomb!! But thats another review for another day."}
{"text":"We went to Eggslut because it is in our hotel and was highly rated. I have to imagine this is popular more so for the \"novelty\" aspect of it, if you will.

My husband ordered the Slut, their signature, it came out looking odd, as t is two long pieces of bread and a jar full of egg and potato purée with cheese...it was overpriced at best and underwhelming to say the least as far as taste. I ordered the sausage sandwich with honey mustard aioli, and it was really not so great. I would much rather hit up McDonald's for one of their classic breakfast sandwiches than come back here. 

The service was fine, but the line was really busy and it took about 20 minutes to get to the register to order. The wait after that was not long, but the food was the real loser here, not the service."}
{"text":"Came to Eggslut and decided to order \"the Slut\". I was kind of nervous because it looks gooey and super runny eggs aren't my favorite. 
Honestly, phenomenal. Mashed potatoes on the bottom were super creamy and well seasoned. The egg yolk was soft but not too runny. Also the presentation and portion size was spot on. 

I can only complain about the seating. There wasn't much of it, and the table we sat at hadn't been cleaned. It had a a fast-casual feel to it, and for some reason I was expecting it to be a more sit down breakfast place. 
Overall solid breakfaat"}
{"text":"I love Eggslut! It always hits the spot for breakfast whenever we are in Vegas!

Favorites: Bacon Egg Cheese Sandwich & the Fairfax w Bacon! Yum!

Line is usually shorter than the LA location! Yay!

Located on the second floor of Cosmo next to the Chandelier Bar... close to Milk & Momofuku..."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by here to grab a quick bite before our long drive back home. It's located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, and you can self-park in the hotel garage. The first hour is free and it's about $7 after that. Be prepared for a long line!! Everything is made to order, so it's understandable that it would take time, and luckily the line goes by pretty fast. 

I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, and it was pretty good! My only complaint is that the sausage had a pretty strong herbal (sage? basil?) taste that didn't really pair super well with the rest of the flavors. I had a bite of my boyfriend's Fairfax with bacon and that was really good! Perfectly cooked soft scrambled eggs are a lot less messy than an over easy egg, and I thought the bacon was the better tasting protein option."}
{"text":"The line was long, but Eggslut was worth the wait. We had the Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwiches. They were great and very fresh!"}
{"text":"Delicous!! Everything was made to order and still the orders came out quickly. The egg was cooked perfectly with a dark golden yolk. The line moved fast and the staff was super friendly.  So worth it!"}
{"text":"This has the potential to be so good. The problem is the wait. We waited in line for a good 20-30 to order, not the issue. We then waited another good 15-20 for our food. That's where I have the issue. Eggs don't take that long to cook. This sandwich assembly line should be a well oiled machine but it was just chaos. People that ordered after us were getting their food before us. And there were some that seemed like they had been waiting far longer than we did. They definitely need to work with that because while our sandwich was good, I don't think I would have waited the 45-50 minutes. 

We both got the Fairfax with bacon added. That really was good. This would have gotten 5 stars but they really need to work on efficiency. 

The scrambled eggs were perfectly creamy and the bacon seemed like a good quality. And the bun. Holy cow. I was a little hesitant to see essentially a hamburger bun as the main bread, but wow was that amazing. The spicy mayo was the perfect touch at the end. The Fairfax was supposed to have caramelized onions on it, and neither of ours did. Can't say I missed it but would have been nice to try it with the completed recipe.  Not a huge deal. 

Definitely would eat again if they work on kitchen efficiency."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for breakfast or lunch! Located upstairs at the Cosmopolitan across from the Marquee day/night club! There's almost always a line here, so be prepared to wait. Once you order, the the wait for the food is pretty fast. 

Food-

-Slut - This is definitely what a lot of people come here for! It's basically egg with what tastes like mashed potatoes and chives sprinkled on top. It comes with a few slices of baguette and is tasty together! They give a lot in the jar and we had some left over after we ate the baguettes. By itself, it was a bit salty. 

-Buttermilk biscuit - I recommend this! Mostly because of the butter & maple syrup they have. It tastes best when it's warm & fresh!

-Fairfax/egg salad sandwich - If you want just eggs, I would get this! This doesn't come with any meat, but I believe you can add it for an extra charge. 

-Gaucho - My favorite here! The one in LA didn't have this, so I always get this when I'm here! It's tri-tip with arugula and an egg! Super tasty and even though it's more expensive, it's also more filling. I like to substitute the bread to salad (no extra charge). They give you tri-tip & egg over an arugula salad! 

Overall, this is a must-try when you're around the area! The menu is small, but it has enough variety to please most groups. They make the food very quickly so don't go too far after you order!"}
{"text":"Visited this location while staying at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. Really good breakfast sandwiches. Fast service. But always `a long line even though they're moving as fast as they can. If you don't like brioche rolls, you won't like this place."}
{"text":"INSANE! Such delicious & delicate well cooked eggs in a variety of sampling's. I had the brioche bun & turkey sausage and by far the tastiest breakfast sandwich I have had. Truly put care into cooking and the service is great. Awesome design & location in Vegas! #nomswithdoms"}
{"text":"Not impressed whatsoever with this place. I had wanted to eat at the Los Angeles location so badly, but the lines just to order there are so long! I was happy to see that this place is not busy at all and we ordered painlessly. 

I got the Fairfax, the eggs were cold, the sandwich itself was overly salty, I actually added the arugula salad on top of it to sort of counter the saltiness of the bacon I added. It really was the coldness of the egg that ruined the sandwich. It was cold, soggy, and tasted uncooked. No, I would not try a different sandwich here, I won't even try to Los Angeles location. I can make a better breakfast sandwich for far less money."}
{"text":"Er ma gherd. Ser gherd! The slut is a mashed potato syrupy egg masterpiece. The bacon egg cheese sandwich is what you wish a McMuffin tasted like.  A long line is a pain but worth it. The price is right for the flavor."}
{"text":"Food is very good but the negative is that there is almost always a very long line. 45 minute wait on Sunday morning at 8am."}
{"text":"Overall: Eggslut is good, but it's not wait-in-a-looooooong-line-to-pay-too-much-for-eggs good. I'll just stay at home and whip up my own, thank you very much.

Food: 3

We got the Bacon, Egg, & Cheese and Sausage, Egg, & Cheese. They tasted as expected. I do appreciate that their egg was well cooked and that their buns weren't soggy. However, I think the price is astronomical for something that can easily be made at home. Trust me, I've paid far more for far less without a peep because it's creativity warranted it.

Service: 3

As a casual eatery, you order at the counter and pick up your order to eat when your name is called. The line was long, but it wasn't more than a 20-25 minute wait when I stopped by on a Saturday morning. The staff keeps everything moving pretty fast.

Ambiance: 3

It's a cute store in the Cosmo, but seating is very limited. I guess they assumed people might walk and eat or sit somewhere else in the Cosmo? But the sandwiches can get super messy when you eat them, so more seating would be nice."}
{"text":"Here's one that you'd probably never guess. What came first the Turkey or the Egg? Apparently at Eggslut, they came together...in one dry bun and with there favorite friends, American Cheese and Honey Mustard. All and all the sausage sandwich hit the spot, but them buns are dry. Even at 7am when you first open your wings, them buns should be perfectly fresh, that's the least I expect from a place with the line around the corner.  Otherwise, it's worth the wait. The sandwich is light and not to heavy. If you want to filler up, I suggest you get a sandwich and an additional item to make it complete. By the way, that OJ tasted glorious. Cool vibes of your average food slut."}
{"text":"So good! Waited 45 mins and it was amazing! I got the gaucho sandwich which was good, but the bacon egg and cheese sandwich was so much more satisfying. There is more egg which makes you moan in the bacon egg and cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sausage egg and cheese sandwich. Just wow for house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun. Line was quick. Greeted by name! On point. 

Washed down with Fresh OJ and Cold Brew Coffee."}
{"text":"Omg, it doesn't looked like it would be this good, my mouth is melting!! Great stop!!
The slut is fabulous and so is the other sandwich, delish to its finest and I'm picky.."}
{"text":"Killer sandwiches. Had to hit this up every morning before SEMA and loved it. The Fairfax is the perfect breakfast sandwich (add Bacon, of course). Lost one star due to 40 minute line and the signature \"slut\" is just like real life: stay away. Like mashed potatoes with a slight egg taste to spread on toast. Blah. Stick with the between buns and get fueled all day."}
{"text":"Great place for a simple and small morning breakfast sandwich. Went here on a Tuesday and there was no line! The sandwich itself is very runny because of the egg, something I did not expect. It can get a little messy so grab some extra napkins! The sandwich comes \"wrapped \" in a little mini brown paper bag which I thought was very clever. There is limited seating but you can easily sit anywhere or just be on the go with your sandwich. Would definitely recommend to try this place."}
{"text":"Eggslut has opened a few locations in the Los Angeles area and has become a really popular breakfast spot.  On a recent visit to Las Vegas I got an opportunity to finally try this place at their only location outside of the Los Angeles area.  Situated in the Cosmopolitan hotel, this place always has a line and a steady stream of customers coming and going.  Fortunately for me the line was only 20 minutes on a weekday morning.  I ordered their popular slut as well as their fairfax sandwich.  My order was ready to pick up, 5 minutes after ordering.

Slut ($10.50) - A cage-free coddled egg on top of a potato puree, cooked in a glass jar and topped with chives was the main part of this entree.  3 small slices of a baguette accompanied this dish.  The presentation was unique.  Using a plastic spoon I scooped out some of the potato puree and coddled egg and spread it on the baguette.  The runny yolk, egg white, and potato puree spread nicely on the crispy baguette.  Everything tasted great and went well together.

Fairfax Sandwich ($8.50) -  This consisted of cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, siracha mayo, served between a warm brioche bun.  While the sandwich wasn't as big and filling as I was hoping it to be, it tasted pretty good.  The scrambled eggs were soft and a little runny.  All the ingredients went well together for an excellent flavor profile.  The use of a soft brioche bun was a wise decision.  I definitely preferred the sandwich over their signature item, the slut.

Overall the items I tried were unique and tasted pretty good.  Pricing is a little on the high side for what is being offered.  However I think the presentation and the uniqueness of the dishes are impressive.  Eggs had been getting a bad rap in the past but now all of a sudden they have become popular and are good for you.  This is a great spot to get one's breakfast fix!"}
{"text":"After staying in the cosmopolitan for a for days I witnessed a repeated event; HUGE lines at Eggslut!  I wanted to go each day but the lines were really long and the wait extended past endless it seemed. So, at lunch hour I trekked into a blissful line-less experience. Almost instantly I was ordering and it felt like a dream.

I ordered up the GAUCHO, which per the menu was wagyu steak, over medium egg, chimichurri and red onions in a handsome bun. 

I patiently waited an few minutes and selected a table. The seating at the cafe is limited so additional tables are in the main hall area. This area is dressed in a theme resembling Alice n' Wonderland including a chair with giant bunny ears. 

In short order the sandwich came and it was tasty, but not rock this world tasty, just tasty. 

I would return only when the line is not gargantuan.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwiches. They do move the line but beware there is a lack of seating. The \"Slut\" needs a more egg and less potato. The Gaucho was good but needed salt to make it great. Coffee is average. I did go back a bit later and tried the Fairfax and it's very good. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It was ok.  They only have about 6 sandwiches.  I know it's the cosmopolitan hotel but 9$ for an egg cheese And bacon sand on a roll or biscuit is a bit much. They have the audacity to charge 4.50 for a salted choc chip cookie. Tried it. On to the next."}
{"text":"It was cool to try this trendy LA restaurant in Vegas. It's inside the Cosmopolitan. We got there when it opened on a weekday and there was already a 20 person line, so be prepared to wait if you get there in the morning. We got two of the egg sandwiches - they were very delicious. Service was prompt and accurate. Seating in the restaurant is limited, but you can take it anywhere in the casino and enjoy."}
{"text":"Long wait, but worth it, got the standard bacon egg and cheese and boy was it good; all the standard stuff was done well, and the chipotle ketchup is money.  Normally not a big fan of brioche buns, especially for a breakfast sandwich but somehow this one just works perfectly.  Highly recommended, again just be prepared to stand for a bit."}
{"text":"Our fingertips brushed together ever so slightly as I gave her my card. \"I'll take The Slut.\" Coy smiles were exchanged, a heated gaze was met with anticipation, and I went to go find a seat, eager to get my hands on the beauty known as The Slut. 

Okay, it didn't happen quite like that but I imagine that's how Chris Tucker felt when he was at the massage parlor in Rush Hour 2.

Ever since I saw my California friends posting about Eggslut, I've been wanting to give them a try. Now that they found a home at The Cosmopolitan, I figured why the heck not! 

After a 25ish minute wait, which goes by fast when you have great company, I got The Slut and The Gaucho Sandwich. The Slut was super buttery and creamy! Just mix your potato puree and coddled eggs together and slap it onto a slice of baguette. It was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The  baguette gives it a crunchy element it really needs. I wish they gave one more slice of baguette though because I was left with some potato and eggs mixture that I ate by itself. It was reminiscent of buttery baby food. As for The Gaucho, oh my. The wagyu tri-tip was juicy, the egg was cooked perfect, I love the arugula, and the chimichurri was also flavorful. All this was washed down with an overpriced orange juice and a tiny overpriced coffee. I was energized for the rest of the day though. Coffee + food = Instant humanized Joyce W. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my lunch at Eggslut and wouldn't mind stopping by again. Good on Cosmo for bringing in more great eateries! 

Dat price doe: $37.85 for the Gaucho Sandwich ($15), cold brew ($5), The Slut ($10), and OJ ($5). At least you can use your food money to earn Identity Points."}
{"text":"Ok so I wasn't expecting the most delicious egg ever but... THATS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT.

A little pricey, but the \"Slut\" special is so delicious and unique. I didn't know you could transform an egg so much. Simple, fast, easy, and not too bad for you. Highly recommend especially if you're staying at the Cosmo"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for eggs and breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I would be pissed if my if my eggs are not delicious! Super simple and basic you can't mess this up. Eggslut delivered a tasty scrambled egg in a brioche bun known as the Fairfax cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. Very filling and the line was moving. So, def worth the wait. If you're an earlier riser or stayed up all night in Vegas, you would have no problem getting in line!"}
{"text":"The place was pack even at 9 am in the middle of the week. I had the Slut, egg bacon and cheese and fairfax. My favorite was the Fairfax out of all three. I wish the scramble egg was cook little more, because it couldn't hold its shape and made it a bit messy to eat. Other then that it was really good."}
{"text":"So I had to try it because of the name. The line was around the corner into the hallway. So I decided to try the slut and the Fairfax sandwich. The slut is mashed potatoes with a coddled egg in a jar served with toasted pieces of baguette. It was ok, the salt on top of the egg made it a bit too salty. And I honestly would have preferred some fries potatoes instead of the mashed potatoes. The Fairfax had both chives and onions which gave it too much oniony flavor. It was just so - so, and each item was roughly $10 so rather overpriced. Next time I'll go to the McDonald's down the street."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Everything is made to order and it is very quick once your order is placed. It's not very big so there is usually a line, but it's usually no longer than 10 to 15 minute wait, and definitely worth it. It's definitely a plus that they have cold brew coffee."}
{"text":"Wait time from 2nd poster to the cashier = 25 minutes.
Wait time from ordering to receiving food = 8 minutes!! 
VERDICT? Worth the wait AND lives up to the hype! 

As a local, my reasons to come to the Strip are limited to work, a special event or visiting friends and family. Since the Cosmo now charges an unavoidable parking fee, this once favorite casino of mine sees a lot less of my patronage. But, when I was scheduled to work PAINWeek 2017 here, I made a point to build in some extra time to check out the hype. 

I showed up at about 9:10am on a Friday and the line was wrapped around and down the hallway. But they've got a giant menu posted on that same wall, so be polite and decide what you'll order early!

I opted for The Slut (because, why wouldn't you?) which came in an adorably tiny glass mason jar. I appreciated that it came lidded, making it easy to take to-go. I also appreciated that they \"Recycle their Sluts\" (aka the jars,) although I kept mine! 

I'd never had eggs prepared this way. It's a consistency similar to poached but fluffier, because they're cooked inside the glass jars in hot water. The woman who served it to me was awesome in asking if I'd had The Slut before and instructed me to \"mix the slut well...otherwise you'll just get salt and chives.\" ...good advice! The egg turns into a whipped butter consistency that you spread on your bread like butter (or dip, your preference!) and even though I ran out of bread, I ate the rest by the spoonful right out of the jar! 

Honestly, the wait isn't any longer than at a sit-down restaurant. At one point, a single cashier was manning BOTH registers. Taking new orders on one while processing payment from the previous order on the other. 

There's plenty of table/high-top seating if you choose to stay, but the food is just as easy to grab and go, if you don't! You can also rep an official \"Eggslut\" T-Shirt in Men's or fitted women's. 

If you're not a morning person, find a friend who is and have them order for the crew. It's a breakfast worth waking (or staying) up for!"}
{"text":"We didn't know where to go for breakfast on our first morning in Vegas and we were not disappointed in our choice to eat here. It was a Saturday morning and the line was around the corner but we decided to wait anyway. The line moved fairly fast and it was only about 20-30 minutes.

The people were very friendly and the chef was trying to pose in the background while we were taking pictures. We enjoyed watching them prepare the food and they joked around a lot with us. 

The main critique would be a lack of places to sit when you get your food. It's a fairly small place with only 20 seats or so. When we found a new place outside to sit, the food was worth it. We got the fairfax, the slut, and a biscuit along with some coffee. The fairfax was very good. The bread was fresh and light and the eggs were very well prepared. The Sriracha mayo was concerning at first but subtle and well done. The slut came with instructions but with the bread was very good. It was a combination of mashed potato and smooth cream egg. I know, it doesn't sound good but it was great. The biscuit was also very good and I'd recommend it but when I saw it cost $5, I assumed it would be at least two biscuits and not just one. Coffee was also just ok. Not great but I didn't expect it to be.

Overall, I would rate Eggslut very highly. The food was fantastic and that's the most important part. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"It's good not great.  Eggs were cooked perfectly but everything else was slightly above average. 

That being said 15 minute wait around 8 am isn't that bad for probably one of the few breakfast joints in Vegas. 

Glad to have tried it."}
{"text":"Woke up 'round 1100.  Hungry.  Heard a lot about Eggslut.  Figured I'd walk over to the Cosmo from the Luxor and get my exercise in.  Wrong move.  Vegas is hotter than I'm used to.  And now, I'm even hungrier.  Got to the spot and the line was around the corner going down the hallway.  Must be good.  The line moves fast so don't give up when you see the line.  Plus, I love to people watch.

Settled on the Fairfax with turkey sausage and a cold brew coffee.  The guacho looked good but I wanted to taste the egg in eggslut.  Wait for the food was quick.  Got my sammie and coffee and I planted myself at the bar table.  

Scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy.  I like pork sausage but their turkey one was tasty.  Not overly spiced.  The brioche bun was warm and soft.  Perfect choice for it.  Sauce added to it nicely and didn't overpower it.  Good size.  Didn't leave me hungry.  And the cold brew was nice.  

Might go back to try the other stuff.  Ubering it this time.  

Do yourself a favor, drop that McMuffin and get to Eggslut."}
{"text":"I got the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich with orange juice and my husband got the gaucho sandwich which is basically steak in it. The sandwiches were good! The reason why I give it a 2 star is because it is way too hyped up. This place is literally nothing special, you could simply make this at home! The menu tells you what's in the sandwhich and trust me, just make it at home.. it'll taste the same and so much cheaper. 
On top of that it is way too over price for what you're getting AND you gotta wait in a long line. It's def not filling if you're really hungry as well. I don't think this place is worth the money and wait. 
This place is on the 2nd floor to your left at The Cosmopolitan and it opens from 7am to 4pm. 

I took pictures of the menu as well which has the prices."}
{"text":"Eggslut was amazing! Be prepared for a lengthy wait but I promise the wait is totally worth it. They offer signature breakfast and brunch sandwiches. The environment is fun and friendly as it is located within the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday morning and the line was only about 15 minutes. I had the gaucho burger and the wagyu meat was cooked to medium rare perfection. Unfortunately, the yolk broke early so I didn't get too much yolk in my burger, but the warm brioche bun was easy to bite through and made up for it. None of the ingredients overpowered one another so it was a great balance of flavors."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. 

The orange juice was so refreshing and so was our sandwich. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try all the different types of egg choices but I settled on egg salad sandwich my husband got fairfax with turkey sausage.  Both sandwiches were delicious but the brioche buns were very dry possibly stale?  The egg salad was delicious and my husband enjoyed his too.  We should have ordered without the bun and then it would have been great.  Long line and long wait for food after we ordered so don't go starving it takes awhile before you actually have food."}
{"text":"This place was really good. 

We were there early (~830am) on a Saturday morning and the line still took ~30 minutes. 

The food was delicious. We tried 2/3 of the menu and truly enjoyed everything. 

Seating can be a bit of challenge but people seem to move quickly."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are made to order with fresh ingredients. Not much of variety for vegetarians but still tasty!! Only issue is seating, there are three bars but those fill up fast after 9am."}
{"text":"My star ratings are (as always) based on the food & the service those things that can be controlled by the business.  So I do hold the nearly 30 minute wait in line on a Tuesday morning @ 0800 against the Eggsult, they were doing the best they could given the amount of customer they had.  All the staff I saw were moving/working fast & efficiently, in fact the cook/prep area seem to function as a well oiled machine the whole time I watched them. 

Now the important stuff.....I had the \"Fairfax\" with bacon and avocado added.  It was the right amount of food for a good breakfast.  I spent about $15..... It nearly blew my mind that I was spending that much on basically an egg sandwich...... BUT, it turned out to be very possibly the absolutely BEST EGG SANDWICH that I have ever eaten! It was nearly egg sandwich perfection. Well worth every penny it cost. 

On top of the that, even though they were clearly very busy, the staff was very friendly, helpful, and customer centered.  You could tell that they clearly enjoyed their jobs and like the crowds of customers.  

Overall a really great breakfast experience in Vegas.  FYI - the place is a little difficult to find, it is in the shops on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Casino."}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place. I got the egg, sausage and cheese sandwich and the signature 'slut' which consists of mashed potato underneath a poached egg served with 3 slices of bread. So good! I devoured everything within 10 min! Line was super long. But it was worth the wait! Would definitely come back, but maybe during non peak hours next time!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with eggs. I can have it anytime of day. And I especially love ANY hot sauce with my eggs. Unfortunately, this place doesn't even have it as an option. Like, nothing. 

A little too confident/cocky with their recipes if they don't want to accommodate customers' personal preferences. Kinda rude. 

Not impressed. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is one busy place.  You are going to wait.  The line does not move as fast as you would think.  I had an egg sandwich and It was good.  The tables were so dirty though.  It felt like a viral illness was coming because 500 other people had eaten at the same spot I was.  If cleaner and not a 30 minute wait it would have been 4 stars.  The boss had eaten the slut (insert joke here).  This is really served different.  She had not found this appealing."}
{"text":"This spot is an oasis among mediocre and high priced spots on the strip. It can be hard to find a good breakfast at a good price without having to buffet yourself to death. Perfect place to rejuvenate and refuel in the morning after a long day and evening in the heat. Really good breakfast sandwiches and fresh squeezed orange juice at a reasonable price. We passed this place so many times only wishing we had discovered it sooner. If you're staying at Bellagio or Aria it's still worth going into the Cosmopolitan to get your breakfast fix here before starting your day. Come before 11:30am as line can get long but it moves pretty fast with the assembly line style of making the ultimate breakfast sandwiches with a fried egg, cheese, bacon or sausage on a fresh bun of bread with house ketchup. Yup yum."}
{"text":"need a simple breakfast after a night of going hard AF? here is your place.  i had a hard time saying what i wanted to order, after awkwardly whispering it to the cashier i was given a number and sat down. 

SLUT*
- poached egg on top of a potato mousse - creamy, light, you get your protein and carbs in and it's nicely savory and topped with some chives.  goes great alone or on top of the bread they give you
- sliced baguette bread with a fragrant olive oil

needless to say that it was as simple and good as i hoped for.  definitely on my radar for a simple eat that won't upset my stomach"}
{"text":"The gaucho was beyond amazing, i didnt expect it to be that tasty. We wer gambling and walked up at 7:00am when they opened there was a few people in line, we ordered and got our sandiwich in 5 minutes. Im taking off one star because i wanted cold brew coffee and the girl told me they were out of it. How can you be out when you just opened???"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had, except for my wife's of course. Soft eggs, melted cheese, Siracha mayo, deliciousness. Will be back, maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"I don't usually do this but I feel obligated to post that while the food was good, it was a freaking rip off. $4.50 for a 12 oz coffee with no refills? $5 for 12 oz iced coffee or oj?  I get that Vegas is pricy but save your money. It'll be better spent at Hash House a go go."}
{"text":"Ok my husband waited in the long line for me... we got the fairfax with avacado. Really good! I can see what the hype is about"}
{"text":"Besides that it's in the mall, it was great. The guys who were working were all great & and the food was delicious, I was in a line with about 20 people and my food was ready within 5 minutes which I think is a great turn around. There wasn't many places to sit, but that's not anyone's fault it was the small space they are given. We all just sat on the couches that are right in front. 
My girl told me the \"slut\" was a little salty. But I got the fair fax and it's always made to perfection."}
{"text":"Delicious egg sandwich place in Las Vegas! We visited around 10:30 on a Friday and it only took 20ish minutes to get to the front of the line and then an additional 10 minutes to receive our food. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with turkey sausage which was delicious! The flavors worked together really well, especially the caramelized onions and sriracha mayo, and the sandwich was plenty big for me to feel full but not stuffed. The downside is that the sandwich was very messy, making it difficult to eat. What made it even harder was that there isn't enough seating for everyone, so my friends and I sat on a couch and had to eat the sandwiches in our laps. While Eggslut may be trying to market as more of a grab and go place, I don't think egg sandwiches would taste as good cold. Therefore, I recommend they add some more seating in order to get that 5 star review! Another con is that they don't serve cups of water so I had to buy a Smartwater for $4.50. With a $11.50 sandwich and a $4.50 Smartwater, the price of a quick breakfast really adds up!

Food - 4.5 stars
Price - 3.5 stars
Service - 3.5 stars
Atmosphere - 3 stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. On New Year's Day, this is the first meal that we had for 2018- Slut and Gaucho! Both items were delicious and did not disappoint! 
PRO:
-the slut and the gaucho were busting with great flavors. The wagyu was tender and complimented the chimchurri sauce. How do they do the slut???

CON:
-a little bit pricey for what you get. Bottled water, coffee, and canned soda's priced at $5.00! I'm sure the space is expensive at the a Cosmopolitan, so I get it. 

All In all, the food was enjoyable and the egg chair was picture worthy!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the Gaucho sandwich. 3-4 stars for everything else. The flavor, texture, and quality of the Gaucho were memorable. When I go back, I won't bother with anything else."}
{"text":"My friend has been to EggSlut a couple of times and insisted that we tried it.
The line was ridiculous, wrapped around the corner which was expected. I actually waited at the table for about 25 minutes while my friends stood in line and ordered. Thankfully a table opened as soon as we walked up and I grabbed it because lack of tables here is a given. 
I was pleasantly surprised with their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. Not oily and the bread was warm and soft. The egg was cooked to perfection. A little yolky just how I like it.
The eggslut was very tasty. The potatoes at the bottom were my favorite! I'd prefer a softer piece of bread with it but the toasted slice was good too.
If I were to come back, I would not wait as long as we did the first time. Good, but not worth the 25-30 minute wait. But I'm glad that we did try it at least once. It is a Cosmo staple so why not."}
{"text":"My first encounter with Eggslut was in Grand Central Market in DTLA, and since then I've been waiting for a chance to try it again. Tip: If you don't want to wait long, just come early. Otherwise, since they cook pretty much everything to order, you'll have to wait upwards to 45 minutes. That's just a product of being popular and cooking things a la minute. 

We got there an hour after opening, so it was about a 30 minute wait. The line goes all the way back into this back corridor next to the restaurant, and you have to be careful not to get in the way of the line cooks using that corridor for transporting ingredients back and forth from storage and the kitchen.

The two things we got:
- Fairfax with turkey sausage: The turkey sausage had a bit of spice that I really liked along with the sriracha mayo, and the eggs were just the right consistency and saltiness. 
- Cheeseburger with over medium egg: This was my favorite of the two, since I really liked the fattiness and meatiness of the burger. The pickles really helped cut through that fattiness though, and the caramelized onions were great.  As we were getting our stuff to go, I did appreciate that the egg was cooked over medium, so that the yolk wouldn't get too messy. That being said, I usually prefer the runny yolk with a burger.

In all, it's a very solid sandwich. I personally would have liked the brioche bun to have a little more density and chew to counteract the softness of the eggs/meat, or at least a bit more of a crunch texture. The service is very friendly, and they make sure to get your order right. Prices are easily expensive for a breakfast sandwich, but the quality of ingredients is good, and they are big enough to fill you up.

In all, I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for this. They're very good, but just come early and beat the rush if you really feel like you need to try it."}
{"text":"In Vegas and wanted something good.  This place delivered.  Got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich.  Fresh hot off the griddle, super soft bun, and crispy bacon.  What's not to love.  

Just be ready for a line.  This place was hopping every time we walked by. Even in the middle of the day.  

The Good
Great sandwich
Best prices in Vegas
The name

The Bad
Long lines especially in the morning

The ugly
Nada this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Wow! What these guys can do with just eggs. Pure greatness in every single bite! Never gets old and isn't crazy expensive for strip prices. Highly recommended,"}
{"text":"Oh eggslut you dirty little *****. If your in Vegas you have to stop by this spot, it was delicious and not to heavy. I recommend the Fairfax , only wish they offered hash browns or tots as a side"}
{"text":"This is a great convenient place for on the go breakfast sandwiches. Only downside is there's a lonnng wait line especially in the mornings. It is a small little space so there's not alot of room to sit down to enjoy your meal. However the lounging area in the cosmo on that floor have alot of couches and seats. I got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, but took out the cheese. It was good, but there was nothing \"wow\" about it. It tasted like my bacon and egg sandwich with ketchup at home lol. But yes, if you don't have time for a sit-down meal, Eggslut is the way to go."}
{"text":"Very long line but you have time to review the menu before ordering. The food was amazing and the delivery was quick. However, finding seats to eat is impossible. He had to walk back to our room and eat there. Overall, a very good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Stop complaining, and just get in the lineup. It's worth it.

What I love about eggslut is that they're not doing anything particularly complicated. I had the sausage and egg sandwich. Small brioche bun, turkey sausage patty, fried egg and slice of cheese. Honey mustard and butter on the bun. That's it, nothing magic. But what they done is made sure that each of those elements is fantastic. And that's how you make a great breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. I had the turkey sandwich and it was worth the long wait. It was super fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Talk about the best place to get the most amazing breakfast sandwich of your life! I had no idea there was an Eggslut in Vegas and I am glad I stumbled upon it while across the way at The Chandelier Bar. \"The line is worth the wait\" definitely comes to mind when I think about this restaurant. It took a little over 30 mins for me to get through the line, place my order and get my food. It was all worth it after the first bite into my Fairfax breakfast sandwich. Fluffy eggs, crispy bacon, and that bun! Amazing breakfast sandwich, even more so if you're hung-over."}
{"text":"Yes, there's a long line, and yes, it's worth it! Don't worry - the line moves fast.

I'd been on a past trip and made a point to go again. Their namesake item - the Eggslut - is truly delicious. Obviously, eggs and potatoes go well together, but a coddled egg with super rich mashed potatoes? Genius combo.

I went twice this trip to expand my horizons, although I almost got Eggsluts both times. The second time I tried the Fairfax sandwich, and that was fantastic as well.

Just go..."}
{"text":"~~~The SLUT and Me, It Was Meant To Be~~~

Finally, a second chance for the SLUT. I had an opportunity several years ago to experience the SLUT in DTLA. I took one look at the SLUT and said, 'No Thank You.' I needed something that was going to  satisfy my hunger pang after battling LA's infamous 110 fwy traffic into DTLA. I settled for the Fairfax with Arugula Salad. It was pretty tasty but not awesome enough to deal with the traffic and updated parking fees. Oh yeah, and another reason I flaked out on the SLUT was because I knew if I didn't like it, I'd be extremely upset, also considering the price tags on these babies. 

Whoever said it wasn't busy in the morning was Completely Off. It was Hella Busy with a Long ASS line on a Monday morning. Was it worth waiting 20 mins for their famous SLUT? Is it worth waiting that long in the single rider line for Radiator Springs Racer at Disneyland? Hellz Yeeeah!! 

If you happen to be in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, definitely try the SLUT @ EGGSLUT. Be sure to ask for extra baguette, they'll hook you up at no additional charge. As for their pricing on regular coffee, $4.50?? We decided to take our SLUTS down the escalator into Starbucks. Remember to show your players card for Identity Points (5pts per dollar spent).

Mmmm, I really enjoyed the SLUT. If you're a fan of grits, arroz caldo, and runny egg, you might be in for a nice surprise. The coddled egg sitting on top of hot pureed potato, sprinkled with chives with 5 slices of toasted baguettes drizzled with olive oil. Imo, Amazing! I'd definitely stop by this location whenever I'm back in Vegas. Maybe even make my way into DTLA."}
{"text":"Can we talk about the Fairfax Sandwich? Soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheese, sriracha mayo in some kind of heavenly bun. Best $8 I've ever spent."}
{"text":"If you can stand the wait, you won't be disappointed. My fiancé and I shared 3 items to make the most of our first visit, two sandwiches and I got the \"Slut.\"

The sandwiches were delicious but I have to say that the simplicity and overall deliciousness of the \"slut\" was worth the wait. Creamy potatoes with a gentle coddled egg with a sprinkle of chives and sea salt... talk about comfort food-- and excellent for a hangover lol!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast sandwiches ever. It's hard to explain other than...amazing. I love their whole menu and it's the perfect Vegas hang over food."}
{"text":"I had to find out what all the hype was about. I first had their bacon, egg, cheese sandwich. It was yummy. But then again, how can you go wrong with the palate pleasing breakfast trifecta! Next tried the slut, which everyone says is like heaven in a jar..... ahhhhhhhh, it wasnt...... sorry, but it seriously was just a runny egg over mashed potatoes. Mix it up and eat on the toast. Still just eggs with mashed. So that was disappointing. Thank god I got the breakfast sammy as well. For a first timer, its definitely worth trying. But i dont think I will be a repeater."}
{"text":"While staying at the Cosmopolitan my boyfriend and I decided to try Eggslut on our last day for breakfast. Unfortunately, we fell for all the advertisements around the hotel marketing Eggslut and didn't bother to check the reviews before eating there.

Quality: 

We both ordered the Slut which was an egg on top of potato puree served in a glass with salt garnished with chives. I didn't expect the egg to be so runny, but what I didn't like was the watery potato puree I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker. 

I also ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with chimichurri sauce with I thought was quite better in flavor than the Slut. I did like the chimichurri sauce and tri-tip but felt that there was something missing from the sandwich.

To finish it off we got a chocolate chip cookie but it was too heavy on the sea salt that we couldn't eat it. 

I would recommend the tri-tip over Slut. 

Service:

Although there was a long line I expected our order to come out a bit faster. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out. I saw other guest who were behind us in line receive their order before ours even parties that were more then two people.

Overall:

Disappointed in all the hype and attention Eggslut has and will not being going there again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't waste time lining up for the buffet. This place makes a great breakfast any time of the day."}
{"text":"We loved the Eggslut.  Both the wife and I ordered the slut, which was delicious. Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be slutting again. 

Its was very busy with a good sized line for waiting to order, with very limited seating, so you might have to stand to eat your food, unless you can snag a seat further out in the mall area."}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying that the food itself was good. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese (without cheese). The bacon was delicious. The egg slipped out of the sandwich into the wrapper though so it was thoroughly messy trying to put it back in place and eat this thing. The chipotle ketchup was a nice touch. I would have liked the bread to be warmer/toasted but the bread itself was yummy. 

The overall situation was crazy though (hence the four stars). The line literally stretched around the spot and all the way down a very long hallway. It took about 30 minutes alone between the time we exited the hallway and we got our food! They definitely need a better system/bigger place/more employees."}
{"text":"** THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW OF EGGSLUT IN L.A. EVERYTHING APPLIES TO THE VEGAS LOCATION AS WELL = DAMN GOOD**

I just came back from my trip to L.A and I can honestly say I can see myself being a California gal. The weather, foodie scene & a few hilarious Uber drivers would all be worth it. Being the major foodie that I am, I had a list of restaurants that I knew I had to eat at. One being EGGSLUT *heart eyes emoji*. It was so exciting to learn that I only had to walk about 6 minutes to the Grand Central Market, which is where ES is located, from my DTLA hotel. Trust me, I was fan girlin' all over the place. 

 

The Ambiance 

Eggslut is located inside of the Grand Central Market in Downtown LA.(VEGAS location is inside of 'The Cosmopolitan' Hotel) The market is bustling with locals and tourists alike who have a serious appetite. There's seriously everything kind of cuisine you could imagine. Eggslut in particular has a cult following of sluts who are serious about their breakfast. ES is more like a stand-alone store within the market. As we inched closer and closer to the cashier and kitchen, our heads began bobbing. They were playing the best old school 90's music. I'm sure it was nostalgic for all the millennials in line, too. Overall, the experience was very laid-back and cool. Very much like what I expected just from their Instagram feed. 

The Service

To be straight-up and frank about it all, we waited in line for about 1.5 hours. (VEGAS wait was about 25 mins) BUT, I PROMISE IT WAS WORTH THE HYPE & WAIT. Nevertheless, the food will make up for it. There was so much going on in the market that we were able to keep ourselves entertained. We even met a friend in line (Hey Winne!) She gave us the scoop on L.A.'s best food. All of the Eggslut team was friendly, nice and they moved so fast. We might've waited an hour to order, but it was ten minutes--tops-- for our food. The guy behind the counter calls you by name and repeats your order. Kind of rare these days--adds a nice touch. 

The Food

THEY HAD SRIRCHA. Seriously, that will always be enough for me. I ordered the 'Bacon Egg & Cheese' + added avocado. Delicious. It was nice and hot--no cold food at ES. The bacon was hardwood smoked bacon, super thick-cut. Over-medium egg and velvety cheddar cheese. HELLO. All of their sandwiches are served on a warmed brioche bun, which adds a nice softness. Most of us ordered a sandwich, but my BFF, Teyana, wanted to be adventurous. She went all the way slutty & ordered the SLUT,  \"a coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar and served with a demi baguette.\" (Thanks EGGSLUT) Pretty much, it was hella good. It's a great option for those who don't want a bun!

Ordered 'THE FAIRFAX' in Vegas and added bacon + avo. BOMB"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Eggslut forever but none of the LA locations were convenient for me. When I saw one opened in the Cosmopolitan I knew I had to try it! Even on a monday morning the line was huge - we waited 30 minutes to place our order. They only had one register open despite the crowd, plus the one register was being worked by a trainee so I am sure that didn't help speed things along. 

All three of us went for the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. I was excited to see the sausage was turkey, it seems like more often than not the sausage is pork. My friend doesn't eat pork so she was actually able to enjoy this sandwich. Once we placed our order, it wasn't too much of a wait until we actually got our sandwiches, thank goodness because we were starving by that time!

The quality of the sandwich was good, the bread was delicious and the yolk was gooey just the way I like it. I enjoyed the sandwich but it wasn't worth a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"Omg this place had a really long lone but real talk the like was worth it. I had the slut egg: an over east egg laying ontop of a potato and cheese purée in a small mason jar along with 3 baguettes lightly buttered. I ordered a side of turkey sausage for 3.99  because I'm accustomed to have some type of meat for breakfast. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and everything was delicious.I would most definitely return here"}
{"text":"The wait makes the food not even worth it. And Dree, the expo, has absolutely no personality and doesn't care how long your food takes"}
{"text":"I have always heard about Eggslut from my favorite Youtubers, so when I came to Vegas, I definitely wanted to see what the hype was about. 

Eggslut is a small cute stop in the Cosmopolitan hotel right on the strip. We went around 11:30-12pm, so we expected the line to be long, but barely anyone was there! It was great. I got the Fairfax sandwich-It was absolutely delicious! The eggs were creamy and was cooked perfectly; the bread reminded me of a croissant, with the flakinesss and all; then the Sriracha mayo gave It a little kick It needed. Even though the sandwich was really good, the price for It was a little high for me to go again. 10 dollars for that, seems a little pricey, but when you're in the Strip everything is super expensive."}
{"text":"Bacon, Egg & Cheese sandwich all the way!! I love the crispy bacons, of course the egg, and chipotle ketchup makes this sandwich taste so good! I saw people getting fresh orange juice, and so I also got one for myself. It was good, but overpriced. And my husband says it wasn't even freshly squeezed, so...lol the slut was good, but not sure if I would have loved it as much without the slices of baguette that came with it. Highly recommend and look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"After Marquee, it was about 3am and Eggslut's enticing sign drew us in like mosquitos to lights. Next thing I knew, we were ordering.

I always order the Slut and I don't want to anymore. This time I got the Sausage, Egg, and Cheese sandwich and he got the Gaucho.

The steak and chimichurri on the Gaucho were excellent. The aioli on my sandwich was so good as well. The brioche was perfect.

I think Eggslut is better suited for after-club meal than breakfast."}
{"text":"so glad they opened up a vegas location so I could finally try this place. get the gaucho-the steak with the chimichurri was so dang good. OJ tasted super fresh and delish. will be coming back for breakfast! line moved fast."}
{"text":"If you plan on eating at Eggslut, be prepared for two things: To wait in a long line, and to possibly not have a seat available at their small community table. 

After waiting twenty minutes in line, then another ten minutes waiting for food, I was starting to wonder what the hype was about. The curiosity stemmed more from my growling stomach than my head, but it was quickly answered once I took the first bite of my sandwich. 

I ordered the Fairfax sandwich. The first thing I noticed is how fluffy the eggs are. It's like eating a pile of tasty, yellow clouds. The slice of cheddar cheese they put on the sandwich was thick, so the flavor wasn't overpowered by the eggs, and at the same time didn't overpower the eggs. I am not a fan of mayo, but when you add Siracha to the mix, it solves the problem for me. Plus, the mayo wasn't slathered on. 

The people working the counter aren't quiet when calling out the orders that are ready, so there is really no reason to wait in line at that point, unless you like to watch people make eggs. If you do wait in line, you are possibly forfeiting an open spot at the table. 

The line and wait may be long, but in the end, it is very much worth it.

Side note: If you want coffee, go somewhere else. The copy here costs five dollars, and it's a very small cup of very average coffee."}
{"text":"Went at 12am so luckily we didn't wait in any lines. We had the slut and Fairfax. Both equally delicious but slut is definitely the item to get if you're not sure. I'm glad we got to try it but not sure if it's something I'd be craving to go back to. But it's pretty fun eating an egg sandwich watching the drunk people go by."}
{"text":"Came her for breakfast for our last day in Vegas. I wanted to give this play a try per recommendation from a friend. First off, the line was looooong. If you're in a hurry, skip it and search yelp again for more options... I got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. It was excellent from the soft inside but crunchy outside bun, juicy bacon, and perfectly cooked egg. My boyfriend got the gaucho sandwich and it was amazing. It was honestly worth the wait. No complaints on the food whatsoever besides I wish their prices were more on the cost-effective side. I will definitely come back when I hit up Vegas again. I wish they had a location in the bay area though!"}
{"text":"I had seen so many pictures and reviews of this place, so I had to come when I was in Vegas in September 17. When I arrived, there was a small lineup, but it was so worth the wait. 

I ordered the infamous Slut and I can't describe how much I loved it. The egg was perfectly poached and mixed well with the potato purée and chives. The texture was very smooth and the aroma was just hard to describe. Together with the crispy baguette and it was heaven. It was so good that I came back a few hours later just before my flight back home. A must try if you have never had it before!"}
{"text":"Best egg sandwich on the planet! Must have for every trip to Vegas...even with the long line."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to this! It was not at all what I expected. It's not a sit down restaurant with servers, you wait in line to order at a counter and then have to hunt for a table. They only have a counter and maybe 2 tables but the Cosmo has a dining area right next to it with more tables and benches. We arrived around 1pm on a Monday and had to wait in line about 20 minutes. I ordered the slut which was tasty but very small for the price. I would def opt for a breakfast sandwich next time for cheaper. It was a much larger person, my friend loved hers. The orange juice was also nice and fresh."}
{"text":"Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We had the delicious bacon,egg,cheese sandwich on the brioche bun.  So worth the long line. The cage free egg leaked onto the sandwich and the aioli sauce was the perfect combination of savory/sweet. Will definitely come back for more in the future Vegas visits."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and wait in the long line. We stayed at Cosmopolitan and had breakfast here 3 times in 4 days. Had the cheeseburger (excellent) Gaucho (excellent) Fairfax (excellent) and turkey/egg/cheese (ehhhh) 4 stars due to long wait and mediocre turkey sausage/egg/cheese but totally worth it if ordering the other mentioned items"}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out the moment I heard of it. So, after we woke up we walked down to get us some egg sandwiches. There was a line already and I quickly noticed there was not enough seating except a counter like fixture along the edge of the store. We ordered the egg sandwiches which is what you would expect. They were good but honestly I did not see anything exceptional here. I actually turned my sandwich into a salad which the portion of lettuce was very small. They also serve your food like a fast food joint shouting your order number. I would probably recommend this place if you are on the run and need something to go like a fast food joint, but don't expect to sit or have an experience. Look for other options in the Cosmo for that."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. The one in LA is a bit cheaper but the food is still the same. 
Food & price: they charge so much for just a little bit of food and the food isn't good. 
I ordered 'the slut' and it came out one egg in a little jar and 3 tiny slides of bread. The eqgg was a very small one with half a jar of smashed potato. You have to mix it well before eating. I didn't like the taste. It was the worst egg I have ever had. It was $10 and I could have gone somewhere else with better food and a larger portion. 
I will never come back to eggslut (any locations)."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant at first to eat here since, every time I walked by the restaurant, there was always SUCH a long line just to order. But after the raving reviews I've heard from a few people, I figure, why not give it a shot.

I tried their Fairfax sandwich, Buttermilk Biscuit, and orange juice. It was a little costly, especially their $5 orange juice, but it was so worth it. The Fairfax sandwich had a spicy mayo sauce to it that blended perfectly with the scrambled egg, cheese, and other yumminess mixed into the sandwich. The orange juice was definitely freshly squeezed, and naturally sweetened which so loved since it reminded me so much of my orange tree back home. The biscuit completed this meal since it was a perfect mix of salty and sweet. 

The only negative thing I can say about this is that there aren't much places to sit and eat. But this is a place for a quick(ish) place to grab your food, eat, and head on your way, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect hangover meal.
You don't even need to have a hangover to enjoy it. Truly. Prices ain't bad, either!

Ok, the menu is short, but there's something for everyone here. I got the Fairfax (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) and added turkey sausage. I definitely suggest adding the sausage. My husband's Sausage, Egg, & Cheese (turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun) was devoured so quickly that I didn't even get to taste it! But he said it was also really good - as if I needed more info.

I get a little antsy with food establishments where you're not sure if you're going to get a seat, but people move through pretty quickly, and there are many other places you can sit if you end up having to do takeaway.

As you might or might not expect, the vibe here is on the younger side. Even if you're not hungover, the person sitting next to you likely is. You're in good company."}
{"text":"There comes a point in your Vegas adventure where you begin to crave the normal. Something that's not shiny marble, sparkling marquee, decked out in crystals but rather, something that's just straight up good food without flair. Enter Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan hotel.

Crazy name aside, it's just a place serving up a darn good egg sandwich. I had the egg and cheese sandwich. The Fairfax also looked really good, but when given the choice between a fried egg and one that is, well not fried, it's always wisest to opt for the fried egg. Keep in mind they don't have packets of salt and pepper which is a bit weird for a breakfast joint, but they're happy to give you some salt and pepper in little plastic cups.

Oh, and it's important to note the coffee is pretty terrible here and you'd be much better off walking to the Starbucks in the lobby of the Cosmopolitan."}
