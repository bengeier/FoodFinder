{"text":"My family has been going to this restaurant for years now, and the food is simply delicious!! Last night we payed a visit for my mother's birthday. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread, which was phenomenal; fresh, melts in your mouth. I remember before, at the old restaurant the bread they used to serve was just bread from the grocery. They have come a far way from that! As they now serve fresh, homemade bread. I ordered a chicken carbonara as my entree- which I always order. They never fail to make it so delicious. My mom has been to Italy many times and she always says that the pasta from Paisanos is better than the Pasta she had in Italy!  Whenever we come here, the staff is always so nice. Our waiter last night was very kind. The new place is never too busy, and there is always space- unlike the old place where you had to wait twenty minutes on a weeknight to get a table. Overall I love this restaurant, and so does my family. Thank you Paisanos!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service.

My family (total 4 of us) came on a Sunday to try Paisano's for lunch at the new location in York Mills. I called a few hours in advance to ask them their hours and whether we could just walk-in for lunch at which time the person on the phone said yes, so I didn't think it would be an issue. When we arrived a few hours later, we were told by the hostess that this restaurant does not take any walk-in customers and only takes reservations. We could see many empty tables in a fairly sized restaurant- I guess all reserved. I had never come across a casual restaurant that works like this so I was surprised. She also informed me the restaurant was \"running out of food\". This was also the first I had ever heard of this happening at a restaurant. Thus, we were turned away. 

I gave the restaurant another chance on another occasion and called a few days ahead to ensure we had a reservation. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, the man on the phone informed me that they \"only take walk-ins\" for dinner as they were fully booked. That is fine, but it has just been extremely frustrating to try to eat at this restaurant and we were never treated respectfully or properly informed about the restaurant's policies as customers. I just feel if you are going to be difficult about getting a table at a restaurant and have all these policies just to get seated, to either publish them on a website or inform your customers if they take the time to call you on the phone. It's not even like it's some fancy fine-dining experience. I had the impression they were supposed to be a family-friendly casual restaurant.

One of my worst experiences at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really inexpensive, that along with friendly attentive service are the two things that were good. Wine list is horrible. Pasta was drenched in sauce, more like a soup. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was feeling like pasta, and I did not feel like cooking. So, I did a search for the \"top italian takeout in North York\" and was gratified to find that the #1 rated place, Cucina di Paisano, happens to be a 5 minute drive away. I had never heard of or seen this restaurant, so I was excited to try it. Needless to say, had I stayed home and made myself some KD, I would have been much better off!

Let's start with the service. When I called, the person who answered inexplicably went radio silent in the middle of the conversation, not once, but twice! This was followed by no explanation or apology when she returned. Moreover, when I asked for my order - Penne alle vodka, with added meatballs - which was taken directly from the takeout menu on their website, for some reason it seemed to confuse her and her tone was rude and brusque. I could hear lots of noise and bustle in the background (a full volume conversation in the background during my call in fact), so it occurred to me that she simply had lost her composure because the place was busy.

I realize that a restaurant experience is not solely defined by the phone call, and I was starving, so I headed in still looking forward to a great meal. I had been told that it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. When I arrived, I asked the host where to go for my order. He directed me to the cash to pay. I walked over and stood for a full 5 minutes, while employees constantly walked by and around me (it is beside the kitchen), and every one of them completely ignored me. This included a person who appeared to be the manager - he actually used the computer right in front of me and did not even acknowledge my presence; to be fair to him, he wasn't the only person to do this to me, as one of his colleagues had already done the same thing.

I am respectful that there are many people to serve in a busy food place, and do not feel entitled to jump the queue, however trust me when I say that I am not shy and was making eye contact with anyone whom I could. FINALLY, someone got the message and asked, \"is anyone helping you?\" With relief, I told him what I was waiting for, but unbelievably, he then disappeared, and walked by me several times on his way to other tasks without ever assisting me!

After another 5-10 minutes, I finally lost my patience and corralled someone and explained what I was there for and how long I had been waiting. She did not apologize (a recurring theme here apparently). My order seemed to confuse her, but she processed my payment and then went to speak to a cook, who also seemed visibly perplexed. Following that - you guessed it! - she did not engage me again, despite passing me several times on her way back and forth to the kitchen.

After another 5 minutes had passed, I flagged another person. To give her credit, she was the only genuinely pleasant and helpful person whom I encountered during the whole ordeal. It took her a few minutes because no one seemed to know where my order was, but she found it and sent me on my way.

Okay, so at this point, I was not in a good mood, but I was famished and a great plate of pasta would have been a saving grace. But alas, that was not to be, as apparently Cucina delivers a completely consistent end-to-end experience. The pasta was horridly overcooked - not just slightly, but very soft and limp - almost gooey. I should mention that my two room mates eagerly tested the pasta, had the same reaction and would not take a second bite.

To top it off, I had paid $2 extra to add meatballs to this very subpar container of pasta (for a total of $16+tx), and this resulted in the addition of a single meatball plunked on the top of the pasta. It looked good, but the texture was oddly squishy, like soggy bread; the meatball itself was fairly tasty though.

BOTTOM LINE: Very poor value for the money. Avoid this place and SAVE YOUR MONEY. I hear that PizzaPizza has some pasta dishes and they would be hard-pressed not to exceed the quality of this place."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant picked up some take out Lasagna and Chicken Arrabiata! Both dishes were bad! So disappointed! We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here during the week and the crowd kept the servers busy.  The meals came to our table quickly and we had reliable service."}
{"text":"This is our first time been to paisano...We had  checkin soup garlic bread..meatball  spaghetti.which is really good .. especially the sauce and meatballs ..highly recommended~ not so many dessert option though ...but we had raspberry Greek yogurt ...excellent service ...will come back again ."}
{"text":"I used to go quite a bit to the old Willowdale location (takeout and dine-in). I've been to the new location once and food was still pretty good. However, takeout today was disappointing. The tomato sauce they had before was outstanding. Tonight it was slightly burnt and bland. I'm not sure if it's a once off as they are too busy with their recent promo, but I hope it improves next time around....."}
{"text":"Their pasta is fresh (and delicious) but their recipes aren't very authentic. Their carbonara used cream sauce :S with very little egg-y taste and bacon instead of pancetta. And they use very similar sauces across their pastas and pizzas. The portions are decently size and wait staff was friendly and helpful. 
Not a bad time but I did expect more authenticity."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for the first time, and it was an enjoyable experience. We came on a Sunday around 11:30, so we were the only guests there. The service was great; our waitress made light conversation and jokes with our table, and it made out experience that much better. Seating is plentiful and there is a bar with a small selection of beers and cider. 

The menu is pretty basic; it has many Italian restaurant staples. The food was good but not spectacular. I will say, though, that the food was piping hot when it came to our table. We were all served at once, and the service was incredibly fast. The prices were VERY good. I ordered their carbonara and it was creamy and quite flavorful. The server came over to the table and offered parmesan and pepper. 

Overall, a good experience; I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This location seems to be more family-friendly than the other. It was quite noisy, but the piano player made it a more pleasing experience. The food was actually quite good. My husband said that the eggplant parmesan was better than at our usual go-to spot on Yonge Street! I loved the minestrone soup, and our companion enjoyed her mussels and seafood pasta.  My pasta was flavorful, but there was more sauce than pasta.  I managed to finish the whole thing, though! (As an aside to staff, both over the phone and in person, whatever happened between this restaurant and the other, there's no need to share the negativity with your customers.  A simple \"We parted ways\" would suffice)."}
{"text":"Calvin was great. First time at this restaurant and the food was outstanding! Seafood creole was delicious, as well as the grilled calamari and Caesar salad! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Started the evening with an ice cold Birra Moretti.  Nice!  Enjoyed the veal parmigiano, the bartender said all their parmigiano was tasty and the favorite!   She also told me the portions were big....she isn't a liar!  Yummy veal, pasta and amazing veggies.  Glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch while in the neighborhood on a Saturday around noon. This is an Italian eatery with the classics. The restaurant is spacious. There's a grand piano in the middle! Lunch time was quiet. A few tables. We ordered the Italian salad, pan seared veal with pasta, cheesy garlic bread, shrimp and scallop pasta. Veal came with too much creamy sauce. But the vegetables were cooked perfect for a little one. The food is as expected for a family type restaurant. It's a comfortable environment. Great for kids. Service was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed our lunch. I'd like to come back and try dinner. I expect it will be a different atmosphere and experience."}
{"text":"I'd give the food a 3, but given everything else that happened last night, I'd rather not give them 3 stars. I came in with high expectations. I had a friend let me know they thought it was good, and I'd seen the reviews. I came in about 6:45pm last night and we had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table. I was impressed. I didn't think there'd be so many people. Our server was attentive, but perhaps a tad overbearing, if only in his voice. He was helpful with recommendations though.

I had the eggplant parm. My brother had the veal aglio e olio. Our friend had the spaghetti and meatballs. I think my brother made the best choice of the night, value-wise. I'd have gotten it too, but for variety's sake, I opted for something different. It wasn't particularly special, but it was a solid choice and it was alright for the price. I was expecting bigger portions, having been told their portions were good. My eggplant was large, portion-wise. I'm beginning to realize that I'm not a fan of eggplant or veal parm though. The tomato sauce over the breading just makes for soggy messes. My favorite part of my dish was the broccoli on the side. That was nice and garlicky. That says something about the rest of my meal as well though. I had a bite of our friend's meatballs. They were beefy and soft. They were also very one-dimensional in flavor. 

I'm taking points off largely for two reasons. The first is that we waited between 40-50 minutes for our food to come out after we ordered it. I can't think of one reason why that would make any sense at all. The second is that halfway through our meal, somewhere, the lights got dimmed and it was very dark. I understand mood lighting, but this was on a different level. Everything was quite shadowy. It was just our side of the restaurant, too. There was significantly better lighting everywhere else.

If I come again, it won't be for their regular menu. I'm going for specials or takeout. They're cheaper. The restaurant setting does very little for me."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday .. had salmon salad .. it was so good too bad they did not have jalopenos .. also had veal aglio E olio pasts .. was also very good .. portion sizes were enough to satisfy .. service was a little slow but overall it was a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"This has been my second time and have enjoyed the food. We had the chicken carbonara and pesto pizza delicious. I know taste is so very subjective.. it's hard to compare with my last italian review.

I felt our experience with the food, atmosphere, and service was worth the
time.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Paisano is a recently opened Italian spot near where I went to high school. I came on a Saturday night with my softball team. We were a large group of hungry young adults, so yeah, we were loud and wanted food lol :P XDD

The decor reminded me of Olive Garden somewhat and the waiter who served us was informative and friendly. I had the spaghetti with meat sauce, which is one of my favourite dishes in that cuisine, ever since I was a kid. It was good, but nothing extra spectacular. The meat sauce was nice and hearty.

The atmosphere was a bit noisy for my liking. There was some live music, which I don't mind, but I found it a bit distracting. The portions are large, so come with an empty stomach!

I would go here again to have a casual Italian lunch/dinner with my family and/or friends, but it's not the most stellar Italian food I've had. It was still good though. Would recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying the new location. Everything was good but nothing was spectacular. Our favourite was the Eggplant Parmigiano, we also tried the garlic bread, clam chowder, pesto chicken pasta, and a pizza."}
{"text":"First time for us in this restaurant. VERY impressed! Excellent service, fantastic tasting dinner, wine, and dessert. We will surely be back again. Our server Angel was very knowable and very pleasant, made dining very likable. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is busy. The food reminds me of an old fashioned American Italian menu. But it is a good thing, because something you just want the traditional meal. 

The service is friendly enough. 

On the menu, they have some classics, but a good selection of pizza and pasta. 

The front can get a bit crowded at peak dinner times."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and the food was 8/10. The service was great though! 
The roasted duck was something special."}
{"text":"A step above chain restaurants but overall though was only so so. 

Chicken parm, veal scallopini, spaghetti and meatballs, penne in bolognese - all the sauces were sooo similar I couldn't tell the differences. In fact, all the sauces were heavy in tomato base - way too acidic for my taste. Even the escargots were made in marinara sauce..

Tiramisu was the highlight of our meal but took over 40 mins after we finished our main course to be served. 

Perhaps their party menu/group dinner isn't exactly reflective of what they typically offer? Maybe we will return in a smaller group and for their regular menu."}
{"text":"Meh. 

Portobello salad was good. Caprese salad not so much. Too much greenery and not enough tomatoes and cheese. 

Pastas were just ok. Rafaelle chicken and pesto chicken. Pesto sauce just didn't \"feel\" right like it was a tad creamy for some reason although the taste was ok. Chicken was a bit over-cooked and dry in both dishes. Pesto dish was a bit small for dinner size. 

Tiramisu and coffee were good. Weird the tiramisu was not a brick but it came in a bowl. 

Better options for Italian in same neighbourhood, check out my other reviews."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. The brushetta was over powered with garlic pieces and smell. The chicken parmigiana although fresh was very thick and had a monster thick layer of melted cheese on it with even thicker tomato gravy. Too much to eat for 1 person. I ate half and felt so sick afterwards."}
{"text":"The Paisano at York Mills used to be located on Willowdale but recently moved.  This restaurant is exceptionally good and is not to be confused with the Paisano that is now located at the old Willowdale Avenue address.
 Cucina Di Paisano at York Mills near Don Mills, has beautiful atmosphere.  Pasta I had was delicious.  All three of us at lunch were pleased with the food. Service was very friendly and attentive.
Price is very reasonable and food was plentiful."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight, i would say the experience in this restaraunt was mediocore.  Its a basic italian restaurant, with a basic menu.  Food was okay, not the best. But the service we got that night was really good.

Food:
Appitizer platter- with grilled calamari was good, garlic shrimp tasted like garlic and the bruchetta was the best part about it. Fresh tomotoes and lots of garlic just like how the italians like it.

Chicken carbonara - was sub par, i dont know why they had to drown the perfectly cooked pasta with sauce.  They couldve gone easy with it, my pasta was swimming im the sauce.

Meat lovers pizza - good pizza, baked just perfect with sufficient toppings.

Service - probably the best highlight of the night was our server.  He was friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  He had given us the specials of the night and even suggested menu items when asked about the food. He was also very accomodating and attentive, he would come over now and then and ask how things were and kept our glass filled with water.

In my opinion, you can have the best food in the world but if your service is bad you lose points with me.  I think part of the restaurant experience isnt just food but also the service"}
{"text":".We went here for dinner tonight while on vacation because the kids wanted Italian. It exceeded our expectations. Of the food was outstanding and the service was very very good. Our waiter Michael was very on point good with the kids excellent server. The food was outstanding as well no I've got the shrimp pastel something-or-other and it was really good. And I got a pasta dish with salmon and the smoked salmon that was in it was so good so well done nice Smokey with some saltiness to it  excellent food  would highly recommend it  very good service  or the visit"}
{"text":"Parking is a challenge. Food went down hill from opening."}
{"text":"Whoa I didn't know Paisano opened in York Mills. We've been going to their Willowdale restaurant. So change of plans. Forget Japanese food. Got to have Paisano. We walked in for dinner. It was a busy Sunday night. I'm not too crazy about its decor with a piano in the middle. I assume they have nights here with music. I forgot to ask. We were seated in the corner, a little dark but we don't mind since we have no reservation. All tables with windows were taken. We ordered the Shrimp Portobello and Manicotti.  Our server is nice and friendly. The servings are big so we end up taking home almost half full for tomorrow's lunch. What can I say but the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has prices a bit to high and the only thing that makes up for that high pricing is the chicken Parmesan. The chicken Parmesan is so good and has so many flavours and the only thing that makes it bad is there's a little bit to much salt that makes you thirsty. It also comes with a side of pasta and vegetables with are both amazing. What also makes this place amazing is the service is impeccable and they are very nice hard working people."}
