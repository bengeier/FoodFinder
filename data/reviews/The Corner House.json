{"text":"The waitress out here Erika is super rude. She  accused me of being there three weeks ago and misbehaving even though i was going there for the first and last time. When i said i am here for the food she said the kitchen was closed. When i said i was for the prime rib event and have a ticket she still refused to let me in and not even offer me a refund, cause i didn't want to eat there anymore. 

Finally she let me in upon showing the ticket on my app and getting really adamant to understand what the issue was. I really did not appreciate being treated like shit. No wonder the place was empty."}
{"text":"Cool spot with a great variety of local craft beer and liquor. Awesome staff and good peeps. Live bands often. Def recommend"}
{"text":"Nice mixture of Irish beers, Whiskies, and pub fare

Batter Sausage,  Gallic Bread, Vegetarian Curry and Irish Stew, 

Many of the patrons add an authentic Irish accent to Cozy corner location @ Bowmore & Gerrard"}
{"text":"Had the stew. Don't. She had the fish and chips. Heavy on the batter, fish only okay. Nicely decorated. Lots of Irish folks saying \"fook\" a lot. Don't know if the 8 yr olds present spoke Irish. Has potential but, if it wants to charge gastropub prices, better \"up\" the gastro. Might try once more...."}
