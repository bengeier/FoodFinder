{"text":"Nice little brunch spot and it happens to be the name of my favorite movie so we had to stop. I got \"the bird\". It was good, I had the hash browns instead of the potatoes with peppers and onions - glad I made the switch. It was hearty and flavorful!"}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place in the worst way.  The Decor and Staff, like Scottsdale in general are a little too pretty - but I was proven wrong.

I had a Tuscan Omelette - Buffalo Mozzerella Cheese with Pesto, and Husband had Huevos Rancheros which was served with an insane amount of Beef on a Baked Tortilla.  It was good - Really good.  The side potatoes had nice fresh green and red peppers which was a cut above the rest of the homefry mush we'd been having all week.  Coffee - meh.

One amusing item - the \"Breakfast Cocktail\" list offered to supersize them!"}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey egg benedict. Holendaise sauce was different and very good. Had a little spice to it. Breakfast potatoes were very good. Good service."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast in old town Scottsdale.... Recommended by the DoubleTree check-in Concierge as her favorite breakfast spot. The Salmon Lox was delicious. My husband enjoyed the chili verde breakfast burrito... Portions were ample, in addition to being tasty. The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was fantastic. We arrived at app. 8:30am on a Saturday morning and were the 2nd guests to be seated outdoors. Within 20 min every table was full and folks were waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Horrible. Service was not on point and very rude. Rushed food out then disappeared until check dropped.  This place has dropped standards and I will never return. Kitchenis a mess and not clean or sanitary. Done."}
{"text":"Wonderful little breakfast place. Clean and modern, but comfortable.  This is no greasy spoon. Had the huevos rancheros and they were excellent. Plentiful and served with fresh avocado 
 The service was bright and cheerful, just the kind of atmosphere for a morning place. Locals and tourists appeared to be equally represented. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have found it tough to find a delicious breakfast in these parts that is not some chain like Denny's or IHOP.  Well, the breakfast at this place definitely passed my scrutiny.  I ordered an omelette and it was absolutely scrumptious.  And their menu had quite a selection.  And I felt like I was living in a bustling, major city... which, after living in NYC and Philly, felt just like home to me!  I would definitely go back.  Though, I do have two complaints.  The wait is a bit long, but I thought it was worth it.  And the second is that our waitress was rude.  She kept on giving us snide looks when we didn't order right away (my girlfriend and I were catching up) and even didn't give us more water at the end of our meal to make sure we left in a speedy manner.  So, if you are looking to eat a leisurely brunch, you might want to consider another place.  But, sincerely, I would recommend the food here."}
{"text":"crazy busy on weekends... good food, but order it for pickup.

Good omelets"}
{"text":"If the Breakfast Club were a movie it would be rated by Entertainment Weekly as the top high school movie of all time.

In its category, its that good."}
{"text":"Funny, my husband suggested the Breakfast Club,my spot he and the boys ate at during Spring Training.  Funny, because he said it was, \"okay.\"

\"Okay\" did not sound like a rave review, but it was our last meal before leaving Scottsdale, my hubby doesn't ask for much, and how can you fail at breakfast?

So, we were there mid week and late in the morning. The restaurant was busy,not full, we opted to eat outside.  I could see how this spot could be popular because of the location and if the food was \"okay,\" even more so.  I suspect that during Spring Training, the boys waited to be seated and felt the rush of people waiting .... But \"okay\" doesn't sound stellar, does it?

Wow. Was I ever impressed!  I ordered the Portobello Eggs Benedict.  Excellent. Hollandaise and Bordelaise sauces?  Why yes, and thank you! Plated beautifully, with fresh fruit and Potatoes O'Brien.  Delish.

The hubs ordered pancakes and they did not disappoint. Accompanying hash brown potatoes were especially yum.  He has a thing about hash browns, and these were tasty.   

Our server was friendly and attentive...

Yes, I was totally impressed. So A-Okay!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday morning about a month ago for the first time. I've passed by on the weekends and because it was always packed never stopped in. Finally it looked not too busy but it was still a little busy! Our waitress was friendly and prompt. The V12 tomato juice made in house was one of the best things I've tasted. The omelette I got was delicious, the fruit was fresh and service was very nice. I can't wait to go back for some more delicious food!"}
{"text":"Well,had a awesome breakfast this morning. Good service, friendly face and awesome view off the patio.I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good breakfast or lunch menu."}
{"text":"I went with my friends for brunch New Years and this place was nicely packed, the wait wasn't that long. I ordered the Whole Hog omelette and it was good and meaty. It was a huge portion size; I couldn't finish the whole thing. The Bar Harbour flapjacks were really delicious too with their berry puree to top it off. My friend got the Bird, the other omelette I was thinking about ordering, and he gave me a taste of it and I knew I should have ordered that. It was really good. I'll be sure to order that next time I go there."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion."}
{"text":"Delicious non-franchised breakfast place in a hip Old Town Scottsdale area.  In a sea of franchise-dom that is Phoenix metropolitan area it is hard to find good, non-farmed/chicken/cow or whatever themed breakfast joint.  The Breakfast Club happens to be a rare gem in a prime location.  Is the food the absolute best you will find...no, that title is reserved for Matt's Big Breakfast.  But, the food quality and selection and atmosphere are well above average and a solid 4 star'r and blow any chained breakfast joint out of the water.  When the weather permits sitting outside is enjoyably boisterous and always entertaining via people watching."}
{"text":"Great way to breakfast! I like that they will modify your orders to give you a meal the way you might prepare ti at home for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast club. Every time I go there the service is phenomenal and the food is delicious. My favorite thing on their menu is their French toast but their breakfast burrito is also mouth watering. I would definitely recommend going there, and waiting cause there is always a line. But I promise you, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times and have been fairly pleased.  Ate here Saturday November 3rd.  Service okay, but food was cold.  Later, after no other food, stomach problems and out it came.  My impression is that they are so busy they cut corners, with the food and probably with the prep in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is good. The servers are nice, but the service is a little slow. Don't go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and went to the breakfast club. Worst breakfast experience ever. Your experience in a restaurant starts from the time you are greeted and usually sets the tone of everything to follow. We sat at the counter and the black girl working it looked at us like  she wanted to know what the hell we were doing there and what do we want. If she attempted even the slightest smile it woulda cracked that pretty smooth face for sure. Why do they hire people to work with the public that have absolutely NO PEOPLE SKILLS. Ok, on to the SECOND impression. The coffee. Its horrible. Luke warm light brown dirty water. They should be ashamed they're selling it. LASTLY, the food. It was ok but served to the table almost immediately after it was ordered, cold. 3 strikes Breakfast Club, yeeeeeeer OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, completely oblivious attitude.  food quality not great, cheap ingredients and you can taste the difference plus they play annoying teenybopper music with douchey clientele"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I've never written a bad review but I've never been treated like this before so I feel it is necessary. Readers digest version: 

Poor service. Hostesses who give your table away to the wrong party. Blatantly rude waitresses who push through in between your guests aggressively to retrieve a water glass and kick you out when you just closed out your ticket (who isn't even your waitress). A manager with zero customer service skills who dismisses your concerns about the lack of service from her waitresses, claims you are lying about your wait time, and is full of excuses. 

SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Well executed today by the Breakfast Club. Used the waitlist from Yelp and they were timely, the service was top notch (friendly and quick), and the food was great (especially the Eggs Benny). Good sized portions with all the right flavors. Good job people!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, large portions, and great price. Highly recommended from an out of town first timer."}
{"text":"On my second official weekly brunch with my friend, we decided to hit The Breakfast Club up, and I really liked this place for Sunday brunch.  We had to wait for a little while, but it wasn't any more than I would expect to wait for a popular brunch spot.  We had the option to sit in or outside, and though we said the fastest seat was ok, we were secretly hoping to sit inside.  Lucky for us, our wish was granted and was seated inside.  

My friend ordered the cinnamon challah french toast, which looked AMAZING.  It came topped with candied nuts, seasonal berries, and Vermont maple syrup.  I ordered the BC burro, which was egg, ham, cheese, and green pepper wrapped in a tortilla with a side of hashed browns.  Let me just tell you, BC knows how to do their hashed browns right!  Perfectly browned but not burnt.  The burro was pretty darn good, too, and came with a side of salsa, but I personally liked it better topped with ketchup.  Let me also state here that the burro was totally cheap: about five bucks.  The french toast was not as cheap, but it also was not any more expensive than other brunch places.  The coffee we ordered was awesome because it came hot and strong, which is perfect for a lazy Sunday morning, and the waitress was quick to come around with refills, too.  

The reason I'm not giving this place a perfect five is for two reasons.  The first is that the waitress came back with a side of bacon for my friend, which he did not order.  It wasn't a big deal, but he doesn't eat meat, so it was gross for him, and he had ordered hashed browns, so technically, the order came out wrong.  The bigger issue was that about 80% of the way through eating his huge portion of french toast, my friend discovered a hair in it.  Lucky for the staff, my friend is not grossed out by hair found in food and just removed it, then continued to finish his meal with the idea that if he HAD eaten it, it'd have been considered more protein, but for normal people, finding a piece of hair in food is a deal-breaker, so I thought I'd mention it.  My food was fine, though, and it was good, so you go and make your own judgment call.  Oh, and I might also forewarn any of you who decide to go here that the parking situation is kind of crappy.  Just so you know."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the coffee was horrible. I got the loaded breakfast (2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, and fruit). Good portion and decent price, but, if you like coffee, this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came in about 2 weeks ago, never been there before, and the food was great! Service too.  Brittney I believe was out waitresses name. Super nice! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best american breakfast i've ever had, hands down.

Great service, great coffee, great start to the day.

Better than any place I've been to in college towns or new york city(where I'm from)

The pancakes(with bananas foster) were out of this world and went great with the quick start loaded breakfast."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast burrito monster style grew chili and queso on the burrito with over easy egg inside..   Delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! If you do not have your party there then they do not seat anyone!! The are rude and very snobby for a service that should be great. Food is fine if you can get past the service :/"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place ever. I've moved around a lot and never had that \"neighborhood breakfast joint\" that the locals go to, and now I finally do. (Smiles!) Their omlettes are absolutely delicious, you can either make your own or pick from a few that they have created... like The Bird... yum. They have tons of pancakes topped with candied nuts, fruit purees, whipped cream, and even ice cream. Is this really breakfast?! :) They also have a number of healthy options, you can order egg whites, and they have great fresh fruits, oatmeal, and yogurt. I love their toasted bagels and soy lattes. Their lunches are actually really good too... I've had their Turkey Club Wrap and it was great, breakfast is still served all day though. I recommend going early though! It gets packed after 8am on weekends and usually even weekdays."}
{"text":"Freshly made pineapple juice! Omelettes are great here. Service is on point, and lots of options to choose from :)"}
{"text":"Food was ok - out of four of us, two of us liked our food and two didn't. It seems odd to me that this place has a line outside the restaurant. It's really not that great. If you're looking for average breakfast food, that's what you'll get."}
{"text":"kool spot. visting from Los Angeles...feels like we are having breakfast in the Santa Monica area :)"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for a few days and found this place on Yelp. Decided to give it a try on a Sunday morning. I was not disappointed one bit. I was told when we arrived that the wait would be about 30 minutes. They were right on the mark. It took the waitress a little long to get to us initially, but once she got to us she was very attentive. The food came out super fast. I had the traditional Eggs Benedict and my wife had the BC Signature French Toast. While the Eggs Benedict was great, the Signature French Toast was to die for. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and the prices are reasonable. The restaurant was really fantastic."}
{"text":"Really great service, very good breakfast, very busy atmosphere... Well worth the wait if you have to wait. My waitress Stephanie was awesome! :-) I didn't have to worry about anything she was always there before I needed it So professional so nice & very caring I was going to give a four-star but because Stephanie was so awesome I'm giving you guys a 5 star!   Whoever said employees don't matter? Keep up the great service Stephanie, you're awesome!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad here from the breakfast menu. It it much more spacious since the renovation! If you wait a little it is okay because they always get your food out fast making up for it. The have great frozen coffee. Try the toffee nut:) Although we live clear on the opposite side of town we like to stop here first before other errands in the area."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was bad. Plate was dirty. Waitress was unavailable anywhere. Won't return for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! The border bowl is by far the best thing on the menu, never had a bad experience here! 

Their waffle is also amazing, best waffle in town for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the top in the area for a reason. I got the monster burrito, and was full for most of the day. My girlfriend got the smoked salmon lox bene, which was delicious. The food is great, but the wait can be long unless you call in advance. If you think you will be coming call 30 minutes in advance, so then you will likely get a table by the time you get there. If you can't call ahead you can always go straight to the bar."}
{"text":"By FAR one of my favorite places to have breakfast. The intimate setting gives off the \"mom and pop\" breakfast joint feel you might find in a beach town. The menu accomodates for the health-conscious but breakfast-loving eater. The only reason why I knocked it down a point is the wait. Unless you go during the weekdays or early morning on the weekends, expect to wait upwards to 45 minutes. My suggestions... their egg white omelets and for those coffee lovers, you HAVE to try the BC coffee!"}
{"text":"No Wi-Fi which at this point is a must have for those of us meeting customers out for breakfast.  The greeting staff was rude and won't seat you until your entire party arrives. The food is good but giving two stars in that service carries a heavier weight for me over Breakfast food quality."}
{"text":"The Whole Hog omelette was large by too dry. The tea selection was poor. No alcohol. Service is fast but somewhat sterile. Waiting for a table and menu pricing, while reasonable, are incommensurate to what you get."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Moms all over the country for years have woken up to make the meal that breaks the fast of a long nights sleep.  But after a certain age, people forget about breakfast at home and look to other venues to start their day.  A good breakfast place is hard to find.  For the most part, restaurants set a up a line that is too quick to think about quality, and only thinks only of the amount of tables that they can serve, and though that is important, the flavor and prep of the food should not suffer in the process.  The find a restaurant that can do both is rare.
 The Breakfast Club is located on Scottsdale Road and Stetson Dr puts forth a valiant effort to bring back quality to an extremely busy establishment.  I've driven by before, and the line on a Sunday morning is out the door.  Upon entering the restaurant, one would see that there is a coffee bar in the back and seating for up to forty people.  There is seating available outside, but on a cold day, there are fewer people wanting the brave a brisk morning then there are fingers on a hand, but I am one of those people.  The friendly greeting from the hostess helped warm the morning, and I was seated immediately to a corner table outside.
 The menu is your atypical breakfast place, with foods ranging from the simplicity of the egg to the flavorful complexity is that is a Belgium Waffle topped with just about anything a good breakfast place would offer.  It was definitely a busy morning and the waitress was running around like an organized chicken with her head cut off.  The greeting was friendly as she took my drink order, coffee, and returned quickly with it.  My palate wanted something rich and my stomach wanted something filling, so we all agreed with a Belgium waffle and a side of sausage patties.
 I surfed the Internet thinking that with as busy as they are, I would have time to be nerdy and check my fantasy football team.  Oh, how I was wrong.  A vinaigrette bottle, filled with warm, rich maple syrup was brought to the table, and suddenly the food was promptly delivered.  First I took the butter and smothered it on my waffle.  A bad butter can kill a meal, but if I want to see what type of place this is, then I was going to go for it.  The people at the Breakfast Club must have known this, because the butter was fresh and whipped.  I dug into the waffle.  The rich flavors filled my mouth, and the mixture of butter, syrup and waffle brought a smile to my tongue.  Next I took a bite of the sausage patty.  Think and juicy, it was not too greasy as so many places, and was that perfect blend of fat and pork products.
 Enjoying every bite, I fully expect to come back again.  The bill was reasonable, and the food lived up to the slightly more than Denny's total.  I felt like I was pay for quality.  You might not want to serve detention on a Saturday, but if you are looking for a nice breakfast with friends, then the Breakfast Club is the place you want to go.  My only recommendation would be get there early, because it will fill up.  But if you have to wait, the food will sing to just for you, \"Don't you forget about me,\" and you won't."}
{"text":"The food is very good and reasonable however there is a considerable wait and the noise level for seniors is very high."}
{"text":"I used to be a HUGE fan of the breakfast club, even when I had to wait in the 100 degree heat with a hangover and now I am not. I have had the eggs Benedict, the breakfast burrito, and the Greek omelet and they are all bland and quite frankly taste the same, even with the red and green sauces on the burrito. I ate there again last weekend (because my boyfriend wanted to) and I had the lox and bagel, which was down right gross. The salmon was the nastiest color and tasted almost as bad. The bagel, was well, a bagel, but not even a good one at that. Next time I am in Scottsdale I will be going elsewhere for breakfast, I'll skip the wait and the bad food."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. I came here during my Spring Training trip for breakfast and it definitely hit the spot. Be ready to spend some time with their menu; there's a lot of great choices and some are pretty creative. Service was A+ I don't think we had to ask for anything the entire time. Portions are huge and definitely filling. To top it all off we got to meet some players too. This definitely a must visit for breakfast in Scottsdale and we will definitely be back next year for Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that I really love breakfast. Secondly I really love breakfast club. Every Omelette on their menu is bomb, pancakes are light and fluffy. Lunch menu is stellar too, try the turkey Reuben or tuna salad melt. 
I make it a point to go to bc every weekend."}
{"text":"Overrated. Very busy, always a wait to get in. Patio is loud. Food is meh. No soda. Kind of pricey too."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  I remembered liking the food, but the second visit I had  the breakfast burrito and coffee (their espresso machine was broken that day).  I left with a stomach ache.  The coffee was terrible and the burrito was yuck.  If you go, stick to the standards...but in my opinion, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"They had me at fresh squeezed pineapple juice.  We were in Scottsdale for spring training and came here on the advice of a friend.  Thank you, friend!  We enjoyed our meal so much we came back the following day.  Again, fresh squeezed pineapple juice, heavenly."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast during MLB spring training. It was busy, but that was expected because I'm pretty sure that's the busiest time of the year for Scottsdale. We yelped this place before-hand and walked over here from our hotel, checked out the menu and decided to go with this place. The wait to be seated was about 15 minutes. The place itself was super cozy. They had a little barista in the back to grab coffee while you waited. 

I ordered the Bello Bene which was their vegetarian option for the eggs benedict. It had portabella mushroom, hollandaise, and bordelaise sauce on an english muffin with of course eggs. Yum, the sauces were delicious. My mouth waters when I think about it. It also comes with homestyle potatoes and cantaloupe. I was craving a waffle, so I ordered a regular belgian waffle with just butter and syrup...$7. A little on the pricey side for a regular ass waffle if you ask me, but regardless it was good.

Would I come here again? Sure. It was better than US egg (another breakfast spot in Scottsdale). It was also very convenient, within walking distance from our hotel and to the stadium."}
{"text":"\"I liked this place. So did my husband and our kids. We eat here every time we come to Scottsdale and have always enjoyed our meals along with the service, which is very professional, friendly and quick. And for those of you who find it more like breakfasting in Silicon Valley here, I have to wonder if you get out much? It's like that everywhere you go in Scottsdale (boobs and blondes) every which way you turn!  But, anyway, great bacon to be had here, and according to my 13 year old son, the chocolate chip pancakes aren't bad, either! My husband really likes the omelettes here, and my youngest son loves the scrambled eggs. The only draw back is the wait, and not so much the wait itself, but rather where you'll most likely end up waiting, because it does get busy here and there isn't a lot of waiting space inside, and let's face it, it is Scottsdale, so in the summertime, it does get pretty hot outside, and waiting outside in the heat can be a little much for some. But other than that, we really, really like this place. :)"}
{"text":"Went this morning for breakfast and was very satisfied. I had the breakfast grilled cheese which had bacon, hashbrowns, eggs and two cheeses on sourdough bread. It was delicious. Also got one chocolate chip pancake for something sweet to share and it was decadent. My boyfriend had a tall Bloody Mary which was good and the breakfast burrito. My sister had a cup of oatmeal and the quick start. I also had a glass of fresh orange juice which was perfect, without pulp! I'd go back but there are so many good breakfast choices in Scottsdale that I would have to try some others my next visit."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best breakfast spots I've ever been to. The service was excellent. Food was amazing. Just make sure you are prepared for the wait to get in! You'll love this place!"}
{"text":"We go out to breakfast everyday and visited the Breakfast Club while we were in Scottsdale. It's a very popular place (ie: there will be a bit of a wait) and for good reason. The restaurant is full of energy, comfortable, and the food is great. You should give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is moldy, my friend became very ill after eating this moldy sandwich.  We talked to the manager and still had to pay for the food that we did not eat and made my friend ill."}
{"text":"Boyfriend & I were in Scottsdale for golf vacation so breakfast was a must. We went to US Egg, the Good Egg and Butterfield's Pancake House on Shea Rd. All three were better than BC. Sat down to nearly empty restaurant late on a Tuesday morning  when waitress finally came over , BF ordered diet coke and was told that they have Coke only. I ordered iced tea no lemon and got lemon and after I added a Splenda & tasted it it was fruit flavored which I don't like. When asked the server said it was black tea then admitted it was mango tea. So I said I'd just have water and after some eye rolling I finally got it. My tomato soup was ok but the grilled cheese had some burnt charcoal bits from the flattop. Boyfriend asked for cheddar in omelette and got  pepper jack(yuck) also asked for fruit but got barely warm potatoes O'BRIEN. More eye rolling when he asked for the fruit. This place seems to want to be a healthy hip place but with the bad service I got I wouldn't ever recommend or give them another dime.  Go somewhere ele"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service really made the experience an average one at best.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorrizo, and I have to admit, it was really good.  I still cant get over how long it took to get my water glass refilled, however.  I almost started drinking the ketchup!  If the service was better, this would be the ideal breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Must say it was a great breakfast. As stated in most reviews this place stays busy, but we were seated in less than 10 mins (on a Tuesday around 10:30am). Our waitress was friendly and service was good. 

I ordered a Mimosa, it was great, more Champagne and less juice, just the way I like it. : )  I ordered a Mignon Bene (eggs Benedict with filet Mignon), every bite of it was good as was the side of potatoes (they could be an entree in their own, soooo good). 

My friend had a bird omelet, it was huge, looked great. But her coffee stole the show, her cappuccino, came in a clear mug, so you could see the layers of coffee and milk and foam. It looked fabulous."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for a table. The hostesses were beyond rude. The food was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the blueberry pancakes that aren't too sweet.  Also I tried a bite of huevos rancheros and they were quite good. Tip. This place is packed but no waiting if u ask to sit outside."}
{"text":"Great bfast and even better coffee.  Waiting kinda stinks tho get there early or bake in the sun waiting for a table.  Need more square feet."}
{"text":"Food was good. Restaurant was way too loud. I was there at 11am on a Thursday.  I asked the server to please turn the music down. Nothing was done, so I asked the server and the employee behind the counter to please turn the music down. The employee behind the counter (bar area) stated that she turned the music 'way' down.  I could not tell any difference in the noise level. I was very polite.  I returned to my seat. The server came next to me to take our food order. I spoke in a normal tone when ordering.  Ironically,  she asked me to repeat my order because she could not hear me. She was standing right next to me.  I again was very polite throughout my entire  time there. The open concept of the restaurant adds to the noise level.  The restaurant was busy, however the loud music level contributed to the noise level. I do enjoy the type of music that was playing, but I also enjoy speaking to the other people in my party."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sat morning before flying out of PHX

Upon arrival we could see a wait from the car and then parking was around back. I went to add my name on the list for 3 of us and she said 20 min wait

So we looked at the menu and they had fresh fruit, and typical breakfast foods with a full coffee bar. 

I ordered the southwest Rancho Huevos it came in a tortilla with eggs and cheese hot sauce and sliced pork. My girlfriend got an omelet and it came with huge slices of fresh fruit and potatoes with peppers. Her other girl friend got the four cheese omelet and could barley finish it. We all where stuffed and extremely happy with breakfast. 

I would recommend this place with out a doubt to anyone in the area who is hungry for fresh breakfast."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other food but I had the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast and it was fa-bu-lous.  Husband had Whole Hog Omelet (he didn't complain) but wished he'd had ordered Huevos Rancheros too.  I would go back for that breakfast next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"NO WIFI?  Bad start.  OJ did not taste fresh squeezed for $4 for the small size.  The potatoes that came with my breakfast burrito were amazing.  The fresh fruit that come with it was really a nice touch and all tasty.  Unfortunately, the breakfast burrito was not great.  I also added the pork green chile for an extra buck and was thinking I was getting a green chile sauce covering my burrito instead of a heaping load of pulled pork with green chile in the meat, but no delicious green chile sauce (probably my own fault for a different expectation).  The burrito was big enough to split, it just wasn't good.  Btw, the burrito doesn't come with salsa."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ordered the bannana foster waffle for breakfast and it was amazing! Wait staff was fast , tentative and friendly.  Such a cute place.. busy but was quick to get our party of 8 in! Recommend and will eat here again"}
{"text":"You can always judge a restaurant by the lines outside waiting to get in.  This place was busy each and every single day that we came for breakfast during our vacation to Scottsdale!  We chose to sit at the counter during our 3 visits (yes, we decided to eat here every single morning!) and the service was impeccable!  The waitresses were over the top with their customer service!  Being from out of state, they gave us many suggestions on where to visit, where to eat and what areas to look in during our home search.  

The food was reasonably priced and portioned.  My husband had both breakfast and lunch during our times there and said that both were delicious.  This is definitely a location that will be our \"go to\" when in Scottsdale in the future."}
{"text":"This is the first time I been to this place.I went around early hours of morning.They got plenty of breakfast options since I am on a diet I tried Lean & green with avocados inside the omelette  and it was amazing ."}
{"text":"The place so nice we went there twice. First went on a Sunday. Place was packed yet wait was only about 15 minutes. The great Scottsdale weather helped make the wait more enjoyable. We ended up with an inside table and the hostess was helpful with making room for our baby jogger. Food was all great. Fresh squeezed OJ is awesome there. We went back the next day (monday) and the place was much less busy. Was able to sit outside. Food was excellent again. We both had different things and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years.  One word...consistency!  So now, a few thoughts...

The waitresses:  consistantly revolving door of attractive, young, bright-eyed co-eds (or were co-eds til Financial Aid ran out)--but they can take a deliver an oder

The hostesses:  younger than the waitresses, too dumb to take more than your name, basically flunkee waitresses too pretty to toss to the curb so they have been given a \"safe\" job

The bussers:  diligent, tidy, always smiling and pretty much the same few guys for the past five years

The barista:  attractive, metro, fast with his hands and with smiles to the aforementioned waitresses, makes a mean BC Coffee (Iced Hazelnut infused coffee)

The patrons (as deliniated by time of year and morning...please read more):

Weekday mornings--business professionals and older retired gents in shorts and polo shirts enjoying morning coffee and the, ahem, view

Weekday lunch--biz pros who didn't eat there for breakfast but work with-in walking distance

Weekend mornings 8-9am--locals who know how good the food is and don't want to wait for it

Weekend mornings 9-10am--sun-burned tourists, especially bad during Spring Training weeks, expect kids so over their parents that their eyes may be permanently stuck in the back of their heads 

Weekend mornings 10am on--Snotsdale hipsters, ASU co-eds, Affliction t-shirts, over-sized sunglasses, trucker hats, Coach bags, flip-flops

Okay, so this was more about the atmosphere than the food, which is worth putting up with the above for.  The owner (who I have surmised possibly had a baby with one of the waitresses, but there's really no way to ask for that information along with Tabasco) does what he does exceptionally well.  (PS:  Anyone with insider info on my theory, please offer clarification)

The bacon and sausage is amazing breakfast meaty goodness.
Cinnamon Challah French Toast is pure bliss.
Anything of the Mexican persuasion, gastronomically speaking, is fantastico.
The brewed coffee is unparalleled...seriously."}
{"text":"The 1st rule of the Breakfast Club is not never talk about the Breakfast Club. The 1st rule of the Breakfast Club is NEVER eat at the Breakfast Club. The 2nd rule is NEVER talk about the Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"What better place to meet up with an old friend for breakfast that was visiting Scottsdale!? Oh wait they over charged our debit cards by mistake and besides the tremendous wait, consumed a less than average meal. Next time they are in town I will make breakfast myself."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great scene, amazing food, really well-priced and in a great area. Plus wait staff was super nice."}
{"text":"We waited about 45 minutes for table, not including calling ahead 10 minutes before arriving.   After waiting so long I was really excited to eat, unfortunately the food was really nothing special. I would recommend staying away from the crab benedict which tasted fishy and obviously came from a can. The strawberry pancakes were good and overall the portions were very big. The service was ok but nothing great. Our waitress maybe smiled once which is cool, but don't act all put out when I remind you about that side of bacon you forgot. 

I'm completely baffled as to why anyone would wait for 45 minutes for The Breakfast Club. I don't think we'll be heading back."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Not much to compare it to as there don't seem to be a tonne of breakfast joints in the area. Food is definitely not \"huge portions\" as others have reviewed. Normal portions at an above average price for the just-above average quality. 

Lots of cute waitresses though."}
{"text":"Pretty basic food choices, but really cute interior. Liking the vibe and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great prices and excellent service
We ate at the bar and were seated as soon as we walked in"}
{"text":"Great food, but horrible service. Most of the staff are snotty girls wearing yoga pants. No one at the hostess stand smiled or greeted us when we walked in. Once we were seated, tt took about 20 minutes just for the girl to come take our order.  When she did wait on us, she was not pleasant and acted as if it was a bother for her to do her job. I ordered scrambled eggs and french toast. The waitress dropped off our food, without the eggs, didn't mention them, and ran off. We had to flag her down to say we were missing eggs, and she said \"she'll check.\" 10 minutes go by, we ask again, and eventually get them. If the wait staff did their job correctly, the wait for the restaurant would not be long at all. This place could be amazing if they could figure out the wait staff issue.
As much as I loved the french toast, there are just too many restaurants with great customer service to go back to this one."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's always packed every day here with a line out the door!  They have great food and the portion sizes are pretty big.  I love the BC coffee (iced coffee that's infused w/hazel nut and caramel topped with cream.)  the breakfast menu has lots to choose from (the omelets are big enough to split  for 2 people0 and the lunch menu is great too!  Got to try the green tea here, another favorite!!  They are open from 5am to 3pm daily!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast!! I am never disapointed here. The service if always friendly and the restaurant looks beautiful. The fresh squeezed juice is PERF. I highly recommend this place for any meal."}
{"text":"Came here after a ridiculous hang-over on a Saturday morning. The waitress took very good care of me. The meals are great too. The ambiance is light and cozy for early morning breakfast...and the offerings and pricing is in line as well. Definitely a good spot for breakfast..."}
{"text":"This place seems very popular with the locals.  With the help of yelp, I was able to infiltrate.  The place was hopping on the morning of Black Friday but we were seated immediately at an outside table.  The weather is so beautiful here that we've been taking advantage of eating outdoors again.  

I started with my morning staple of hot tea.  They had Irish Breakfast and it was served as properly as loose tea...very excited to see that.  I also had the breakfast burrito which has egg, chorizo and pepper jack cheese and smothered with chorizo queso.  So good and filling.  It also comes with lettuce and beans which I told them to hold.  The burrito also comes with slices of fresh fruit (cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon) and hash browns."}
{"text":"Love this place the juice/coffee bar is my favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The price may seem a bit high, but you get a ton of good food ! Noise level was good-I could easily converse with my friends."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but not terribly unique. Standard breakfast fare.

I have gone three or four times, always with a group of women. I don't think that we received the best treatment; the servers were nice enough, but always seated us in the glaring sun or under a mister or in some other lackluster location. Also, the chairs outside are cheap plastic lawn furniture.

I will go again, but I do not expect to be treated the same way as, say, an attractive group of young men might be."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in all of Arizona! I have never been disappointed by the food. My favorite dish is the breakfast grilled cheese, which I never regret getting. No matter what day of the week you go, the wait is insane. However, the counter is first come first serve so you could end up not even waiting to sit down. However, if you want a table, the wait usually seems to be around 30-45 minutes. The servers are very attentive and so kind to the customers. Also, this place is also very affordable, and the prices are not that expensive unlike other brunch restaurants. Great place to go if you are looking for a quick and good meal!"}
{"text":"Good food and the new ambiance is nice. Not a lot of vegetarian options but they have some delicious food. Make your own breakfast burrito is a good value."}
{"text":"Great place for a Sunday brunch if you don't mind waiting a while for a seat. This place is delicious and popular but very packed. We waited longer than we would have liked, but once we were seated the service was great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for the weekend and came here for breakfast! Loved the menu and the food was delicious! Service was great! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I had a cup of coffee, the side oder of  Biscuits and Gravy, and the Turkey Eggs Benedict.  The coffee is ok. A little bland. Both meals were tasty. The biscuits are home made with cheddar and jalapeños. The gravy is perfectly seasoned. It came out not hot, so that was a bummer. The Turkey Eggs Benedict wasn't the best I ever had. But it was yummy. The Turkey was stiff. I like turkey that kinda melts in your mouth. The dish was under sauced. 
I gave this place 4 stars because my girlfriend really likes this place. She ate a bacon, egg sandwich on sour dough bread."}
{"text":"Every time we come to AZ we always come here for breakfast at least once!! We love this place. Best egg sandwich EVER!"}
{"text":"Great food! I've had the breakfast chorizo burrito and their tuna salad sandwich, both of which were incredibly good. The prices aren't that bad either especially for the great quality of the meal. Really fun environment, super busy on weekends though especially Sundays. Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I second Christian A's review. Hostess was great!
Food was cold, no follow up by the waitress, awful service. I spoke with the manager heidi, who cared about as much as the waitress. Afterwards realized the manager watched as we had to get up to get condiments and ignored our obvious need for assistance. 

We still left $5 on top of a $32 bill. What a rip. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Place to go and be in the mornings in Scottsdale.  It does get crowded but they do a good job of moving tables.

Food is on point.  Service is attentive.  Wished they would include some kind of hash browns with the meals.  If you don't mind the wait, solid place."}
{"text":"me husband and I go to the breakfast club maybe once or twice a month.  Food is pretty good, we always enjoy it. My 3 stars is because of the service, our server shelvy is the worst server we have ever had in here, seems that she didn't want to be there, didn't  check on us not even once, didn't offer water or anything or didn't make any suggestions. .not fast at all either. Breakfast club please train your staff to be good with customers"}
{"text":"I admit that I am not a big fan of waiting... and if it's a wkend or especially if it's spring-training time of the year... the line to get a table can be rediculously long w/ all the baseball fanatic tourists.  But my friends live here and definitely know how to work it so it's not so painful. Since they do not take reservations, we give our name to the hostess and knowingly are told the wait time to be ~45 min which we tack on another 30 on top of that. So we then get our nails done next door or walk over to the boutique across the street. 
I have to say the line for a latte can be a bit of  a wait as well, but so worth it. Their coffee is truly yummy. I've eaten breakfast here.... their omelettes, breakfast burrito or taco are always good, but my most recent visit I was not in the mood for breakfast.  I had the tuna sandwich
which was exactly what I was craving for... absolutely delicious without too much mayonaise. I hate when other places makes a tuna salad sandwich taste like there's no tuna but  gobs of more mayo oozing out.. gross!  Anyway their tuna here is perfect. 
Although the wait is long, once seated the service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Breakfast Burrito with Pork Chile Verde sauce. And a Bloody Mary. Enough said.

Awesome establishment with a great wait staff. Very attentive and our food came out in under 10 minutes of ordering! Will be back when I am in town again"}
{"text":"The Turkey Bene was amazing! I tasted my friend's Huevos con Masa and ordered that on my return visit. Yum! Everything tastes fresh and flavorful. I especially like the fresh fruit palate cleansers and the bottomless coffee. The service is attentive but even in the middle of a week day, this place can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"So I don't usually write reviews unless I'm very annoyed or super impressed. Right now I'm very annoyed. Let me start out by saying that the food is good. So I came in and was waiting on my boyfriend, I asked for a booth because he had back surgery. The lady told me yes that they had an open booth waiting for me, to let her know when he got here I said ok and that I could go ahead and sit because we were in a hurry that I was going to order our food. She insisted that this wasn't possible that they had a policy that didn't let me sit until my whole party was here. I understand that if there is a huge party but he was down the road and we were in a rush. So this booth sat empty until he got here. Seems a little ridiculous to go out of your way to make sure you didn't provide a little convenience to someone. I'm more likely to go down the road to morning squeeze or chop shop than back here. Not impressed breakfast club."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast- we had the breakfast bowl and breakfast burrito. Good sized portions, staff was very friendly, great service! Long wait, but was worth it!"}
{"text":"I went for the eggs benedict. Very disappointed.
They use a thick slice of virginia smoked ham, and it was quite greasy.
The hollandaise was broken and curdled, and way too spicey. 
The poached eggs were cooked in too hot of water, the whites were quite rubbery.
The service was good, but aloof.
Waitresses wear tight black pants. Some of them even look good in them."}
{"text":"Enjoyed awesome coffee freshed squeezed orange juice waiting for my omelet and french toast. Great atmosphere with out door seating enjoying Scottdale down town view. 

Had an egg white omelet with roasted tomatoes,  swiss cheese,  avocado and turkey. Very yummy!

We also enjoyed a scrambled egg mixture with chorizo and other yummy ingredients.  Very flavorful and a hint of spice. 

Enjoyed some yummy french toast with fresh light maple syrup.

The turkey bird omelet was also well enjoyed with a nice white creamy sauce.

Expect a 30 to 40 minute wait but it is worth it.  You can purchase a coffee and or other drinks while you are waiting.  They will refill your coffee when seated no extra charge.

Hope you like our food pics."}
{"text":"The wait for a table was ridiculously long. I had to wait it out because I reasoned the food was delicious. Our server brought healthy-sized portions on the plates and the food was excellent. The coffee tasted old, as if it had been on the burner too long. The server was super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"You can't be seated until entire party is there, meanwhile more and more people take your spot. Stupid rule, I  do not understand how someone thought that that was a good idea."}
{"text":"Food was decent but pricey, my fav part of the breakfast was orange juice so go figure."}
{"text":"Great location but the food is mediocre. Really nothing special.  Ever since they renovated it (which is a lot larger) the quality of the food has decreased."}
{"text":"Old Town staple for breakfast...always busy, always a short wait (but with bar stools at the counter often), but well worth it. Large plates with decent-sized portions, potatoes O'brien are great addition to each item, and the fresh fruit is a refereshing change from standard breakfast fruit portions, large and full of watermelon, canteloupe, and pineapple. My personal favorite is the The Bird Omelette. Great food, service is normally decent, but not great, but always left Breakfast Club satisfied."}
{"text":"We had to wait about an hour, but once seated the service was fast. We ordered and got our food quickly. Giant servings and very good food. We would come back"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday morning with no wait at all. Pleasant staff and food was good with great pricing. I don't think I would wait in a long line to eat here on the weekend."}
{"text":"worst Benedict ever. Asked for a median and got a well down. The Benedict has no seasoning at all! Disgusting"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place prior to our apache trail drive! For our party of 7, this place was great! We have picky eaters from carnivores to vegetarians, including some that don't eat eggs! 

Table Ordered the breakfast grilled cheese, huevos ranchero, jalapeño cheddar biscuit, mushroom benedit(has another name on their menu), yogurt/granola and a order of waffles for the table! All items were delicious, the biscuit was very cheesy, and my grilled cheese was made to perfect(hash browns, with cheddar eggs and substituted bacon for avocado!) each dish also came with fresh fruit, which was very delicious!!! 

The fresh oj is a must!! 

Overall had a great time despite a 20 minute wait on a Friday morning! Now I know why the wait occurs, want to come back if time permits before we go!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and it was only blocks from our hotel.  The food and service was excellent.  Our server's name should be \"Chipper\", she was so prompt and friendly, definitely a morning person.  Our entire experience was very pleasant.  I highly recommend it.  And don't miss out on the fresh squeezed juice."}
{"text":"I don't know what this little joint is better for, the food or the people watching. Not your typical \"snobsdale\" atmosphere, this place attracts patrons of all kinds. After waiting 25 minutes or so which wasn't so bad outside on an early spring morning (summer might be a different story) we were sat inside, had a super nice server and a tough time deciding what to get due to the extensive menu. They definitely put their own spin on traditional breakfasts here which I appreciated and seems to set them apart from most places. My friend ordered the huevos rancheros which had juicy beef mixed in. My breakfast burrito was huge and they gave me the option to have it smothered in chile verde sauce and I happily accepted. My only wish was that they put a little more chorizo in the burrito itself. Otherwise it was fantastic. Also, the food came about 5 minutes after we ordered. This restaurant doesn't mess around and is a great place to dine alone, with a friend or your whole family."}
{"text":"I came here one Sunday morning when another restaurant had a line out the door. They said it would be a 30 minute wait (which was less than the other place) so we said we would stay. We got a table in 10 minutes and our coffee was out super quick, and was really good coffee! I ordered a classic breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast and fruit. It came out quickly and tasted good. It was nothing memorable, I would say that the food is average...but I liked the speed of getting a table on a BUSY Sunday, the speed of the server and of the food coming out, so I will give it a pretty good rating overall."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place I've been to so far! My fiance and I go out to a new place every monday and The Breakfast Club is beating everyone!!Hands down! The bloody mary was great and the steak eggs benidict was devine!! Oh man..I'm hungry again! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I realize the place is called The Breakfast Club, but if you're open for lunch and have tomato soup on the menu it should not taste like ketchup mixed with water.  One star since this will be the fifth bad review on it.   C'mon already!"}
{"text":"Love the french toast!!  Overall food is very good, service patchy.  Lovely ambiance, on a nice day it is wonderful to sit on the patio.  Plates come with extras such as fruit, potato sides and a little pizzazz for presentation.  Be careful to avoid busy times, the wait can be prohibitive and parking is difficult.  I only go during the off times since I can't take two hours for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Going out to breakfast is something I love to do because I love eggs and corn beef hash. I basically order the same thing at every breakfast restaurant I go to (it makes it really easy to form an opinion). I'm pretty sure my small cholesterol issue can be blamed completely on my obsession on over medium eggs! If you like corn beef hash order it here, it will not disappoint! 

The service is fast, friendly enough, the food is cheap, and tastes great if you are looking for a traditional diner breakfast. 

Many people before me mentioned again love it"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Sat with my wife and friends, everything we ordered was fantastic. Only drawback was the wait for a table, but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I went with a couple co- workers. We went by at 845 and we asked if we could make a reservation. They said to call 30 min before we wanted to eat and we could get get on the list. I called at 10am, they said it would be a 45min wait. I downloaded there app to see where I was in the list. I got they're at 10:40am and told them we were there and they said we still had people in from of us. We waited and waited. 35 min later I asked when we would be seated. They said you didn't check in.  I said I spoke to you when I got there. They didn't note we arrived. We waited for another 45min after the 45 min call ahead. An hour and a half. The food was excellent. The extra long wait caused us to be late. If you have time to spare and don't mind waiting until lunch for breakfast, then this is place is you."}
{"text":"A good place..  As a tourist, most places in the area disappointed me, but I liked this breakfast place.  Service was good, and the food was very nice.  I had French toast, but it was the best French Toast I've had."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time Sunday and we loved it. My wife had a chocolate chip waffle and I had an awesome breakfast burrito. Service was top notch also. Will definately go back."}
{"text":"The pork green chilli burrito was excellent, very lean.  I customized my burrito with egg, ham and cheese, pork green chilli on the side. 

We sat at the bar because the wait was about 20mins on a weekday morning around 9.45am. Hannah, who was the very busy bartender, took very good care of us and was the one who recommended the pork green chilli, which I will definetly be ordering again. 

I also enjoyed the unfiltered apple juice which was a nice surprise to see on the menu."}
{"text":"This use to be a good place to get breakfast a year ago. The quality of food is cheaper now, but not the price. The french toast was stale with about 5 berries on top, and their omelet had about 12 eggs in it and you had to surf through it to find the other ingredients. The waitress developed her personality from a car crash I think. There are two many other great places in Scottsdale to go for a better price and quality. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Clean,bright cheerful atmosphere with wide variety of menu choices. Wait staff upbeat and helpful. Breakfast grilled cheese sandwich with hash browns and an egg on it was really good."}
{"text":"Three stars for service and atmosphere: can't go higher because of the food.  Mediocre plating and nothing spectacular in terms of flavors, even for breakfast food.  I can see how it could be amazing for hangover cure, especially with the bar available at 6am, but there has to be better spots for those who are looking for a real good breakfast."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at the Breakfast Club. We had several in our party with specific dietary needs and the staff was most accommodating and helped us make the necessary adjustments ... the meals were delicious.

Our only complaint was the noise level of the traffic for the outside seating. We'd've tried inside but it was too warm in there and the traffic was the lesser of two evils"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh breakfast options, and reasonable prices. Glad I stumbled across this place and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food is great hostess is terrible since they are the first experience when coming in they should be more respectful my hostess put such a bad taste in my mouth my awesome food just wasn't as yummy as usual."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast place with a large menu but nothing unique.  Long waits on the weekends with better options a few blocks down the road."}
{"text":"I recently went to The Breakfast Club for the first time with a good friend who I hadn't seen in awhile. It was a weekday and so, while it was still busy, we didn't have to wait to be seated. The food was good, but slightly over-priced. My biggest problem with the restaurant - the service. They were slow to deliver our drinks and food, yet once our food came, they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there. I felt like they didn't care at all for the fact that I was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave. After we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes, out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers. We were mortified. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. Needless to say, they didn't win a loyal customer with me."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for breakfast. Better than Denny's and Waffle House but it doesn't match up with Joe's Dinner or Over Easy and for the same prices.  I had their flap jacks and two eggs over easy with a side of bacon.  All good but nothing to rave about.  My friend had their whole hog omelet, which is what I might order on my next visit."}
{"text":"Really good spot for breakfast in Scottsdale. Great service and great breakfast. Nothing fancy here, just solid food. Omelets are really good and pretty large. I love that you can find really fresh and healthy options here. 

The place gets really crowded on the weekends so make sure you get there early. If you're by yourself, just sit at the bar and you'll be well taken care of."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation, based on the reviews. Overall the food was great, but we developed a few words of wisdom on what to order - 

The whole wheat pancakes and the challah french toast were incredible. The pancakes nearly floated off the plate, and the challah and candied nuts on the french toast made it taste like the perfect middle ground between brunch and desert. 

I didn't eat the omelet with salmon or the honeydew (omelets come with fruit) but was told they were great too. 

The only downside were the wild mushroom omelets and the potatoes it came with - they lacked seasoning. If they had any, we would be giving the restaurant 5 stars. The salmon omelet came with the same potatoes, but she opted for the hashbrowns which were awesome (I wish I had such foresight...)!"}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this as a 3.5 stars rounded down to a 3. It's a great place, with solid brunch offerings that are perhaps a bit on the tame side. I've been here before, ages ago when they hadn't renovated yet. Unfortunately I don't live near Scottsdale anymore, and my husband moved in with me some time before we got married, so our reason for being in Scottsdale greatly diminished about a year or two ago. 

That aside it's a great place to stop by when you're in the neighborhood. Parking is a bit of a b!#ch, pardon my french. It's old town Scottsdale, after all. And this place is always busy. That day I went it was packed with college kids on Spring Break and people in town for Giants spring training. 

The waitresses are perky and the food is good. Nothing out of this world, but I've enjoyed everything I've had there. I think once I had an egg white omelette, another time their lox bagel plate. I do love that they have mimosas and bloody marys for you to order as well. Both were also good- the mimosa was fresh and tart, the bloody mary nicely savory and spicy. 

There's a reason this place is always busy. It's in prime real estate and serves up solid food all the time. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the neighborhood and are craving brunch, you could do worse than stopping in here for food."}
{"text":"The noise in this place is unbelievable. Way too loud music make customers shout at each other. The food was just ok, nothing special especially for the price."}
{"text":"I could live off of \"build your own omelet!\"  The food is always delicious and is a perfect place to meet friends for brunch! I also love the remodel!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast burrito. I mean its excellent. I get it smothered in pork green chili. Whew!  Today I am getting the also lovely jalapeno biscuts n gravy w/eggs. Never a bad visit. Always @ the last minute"}
{"text":"Loved it! This place was busy but we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. We had the friendliest server, I wish I could remember her name, she was awesome! The food was delicious and the portions were huge! I will definitely be back to the Breakfast Club the next time i'm visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had a turkey Bene and my date had a salmon oxe. Very yummy! Crowded in the early hours of the morning 
, and especially on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

Every time I visit Scottsdale I hit this place up for breakfast almost daily.

I'm someone who loves large portions for breakfast and this place truly delivers.

The waitresses are all super chill and go out of their way to make sure you're good to go and don't rush you even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Great service and food make for a great dining experience.  This place was busy bit quickly cleared tables to keep the wait time down.  Thr potatoes Obrien are food and the food had a great flavor. A great place to take friends and family."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club is as good as you'll find. The blueberry pancakes are superb, their coffee is beyond description. For a change of pace, try their Eggs Benedict, Southwestern style. A GREAT spot within walking distance...a beauty."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. Definitely worth the wait for a table - friendly staff, extensive menu and the food comes quickly. They have excellent coffee and espresso drinks."}
{"text":"Back in Scottsdale and was excited to dine here. The hostess, was rude and dismissive but the food was amazing. Tried a new frittata just placed on the menu. Table service was great."}
{"text":"Jalapeño biscuits & gravy and huevos rancheros...the bomb.  Me and my boyfriend get this and split it everytime (just 1 biscuit though not the entrée) and we are stuffed.

The only thing that drives me crazy is the wait - which really isn't that long, but for some reason I'm always STARVING when i want to eat here so it seems like an eternity."}
{"text":"We were pleased that we arrived before the big crowd and got shown to a table right away. We had driven by hundreds of times and we always wanted to at least try it once. 

Service was fast and the staff was friendly. I had a delicious smoothie. One of the best I've had so far! My hubby ordered the blueberry pancakes and I got the Cinnamon French Challah bread. I thought everything was pretty good but when we got the bill I was amazed how expensive the meal was! The food was good but not THAT good. I understand they use fresh ingredients and everything but it still seemed a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Had a great meal this morning with the family. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews on here, I realized we must have lucked out! We didn't have to wait more than a couple minutes to be seated on the patio for breakfast.

We basked in the sun while we waited for our food, which honestly was a treat for us. Having breakfast al fresco in February is not an option back home in Canada lol

Our eggs benny and breakfast grilled cheese sandwiches arrived not long after we ordered and we dug in. For $10, you get A LOT of food! My traditional benny came with a side of potatoes o'brian and a stack of fruit. The ham was thicker than I'd prefer. Had it been shaved down to thinner slices, it would have gone better with the delicate poached eggs and fluffy english muffin. It did have a great smokey & sweet flavour to it though.

Knowing I wouldn't be able to finish my meal, it was nice to know packing it up meant I could enjoy a second round of it later on :)

A breakfast place that takes resos (even though we didn't need to make any), has delish breakfast and a patio wins a spot in my good books!"}
{"text":"Don't come here they will mot seat you until your entire party arrives. Not a friendly policy for a place to meet."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I have allergies and they accommodated me perfectly. 

I went at a later time because of the comments saying they are busy (~1pm). It was a good idea, only waited a few minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I have eatin here 3 time, with the food being very good, with great coffee.  The portions are huge! The only disappointment was the waitress, hostile, grouchy and looked pissed to be at work.  The only time she was remotely cordial was while she over us waiting to see what her tip was!   The Daily Dose down the street, has become my new spot for great food and really nice people."}
{"text":"Nice service but way over-rated. Hung through the estimated hourlong wait to find great service and mediocre food--from the cappuccino to the hue is rancheros. Cap was muddy and rancheros soggy. Oh well, next time will know to just walk a couple blocks where things are quieter and the wait time shorter."}
{"text":"Great pancakes! And the eggs Benedict was fantastic until they changed the recipe :( but overall this place rocks for breakfast.  So much better than a Denny's or other chain. Also great for lunch. Yummy salads"}
{"text":"If I could give it a minus 10 I would.  We were in Scottsdale a few weeks ago.  We drove by TBC a few times it looked like people were there alot so we thought the food must be good.  Boy was I wrong.  My sister and I went there one morning for a light breakfast.  We got in there and the wait staff weren't friendly.  I don't think there know how to smile.  We ordered the 2 egg, bacon, toast that came with fruit. I order a cup of coffee.  Simple small breakfast.  The coffee was OK.   When I ordered I asked for eggs over medium ( can't stand running eggs) so what did I get you guessed it running eggs.  I only got 1 piece of bread for two eggs and the fruit wasn't ripe.  My sister ordered scrambled eggs and they were OK.   The waitress didn't ask how were were doing, did we like the food.  Nothing...  The vibe wasn't great in there it was a very negative feeling.  I don't suggest anyone wasting their money there...  Go to the Denny down the street.."}
{"text":"Heard great things and waited an hour on a Sunday afternoon but disappointed. Ordered smoked salmon lox Benedict and huevos rancheros. Lox was mushy with a bland sauce. Huevos wasn't traditional. Came with a full tortilla on the plate filled with a mushy mixture of shredded pork in a sauce with shaved cheese over it. Wouldn't go again even though it comes as top rated on every Scottsdale list. Need a delicious coffee? Go around the corner to Cartel."}
{"text":"Apparantely they aren't connect with yelp's digital waitlist. Because when we got here, they didn't have my information. I got no apology from the front of house staff, and was asked what I wanted to do. Then told its another 20 minutes. Gimme a break."}
{"text":"This place was nothing short of awesome!! The cinnamon French toast was wonderful & the omelette (we got the wild hog) was huge & delicious! Nicole was a great server. Made great menu suggestion and was very nice! A must-visit place for great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Today I'm having the omelette it was very good and the service was good Will definitely be back to this place"}
{"text":"We go here every Sunday, can't beat it!!  I eat out for breakfast 3-4 times a week and at different places.  This place is my favorite breakfast spot.  We almost always have a different server and we have yet to have one that wasn't great.  Today it was Bethany that took it over the top and got me off my butt to write a review.  Thanks for the great service!!"}
{"text":"2/12/2018 1000. Two colleagues and I met this morning for a working breakfast at this restaurant. We waited for our table for 15 minutes, which was not unreasonable. When our table became available,the hostess refused to seat us, (our colleague was parking), until \"she walked through the door.\" There were people seated in our stead, that had arrived after us.  It was too late to change this site, as we all had driven from different valley hospitals. Our colleague arrived momentarily and then we were seated. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. The food was not anything out of the ordinary, but that was not the focus of the breakfast. As we sat discussing work issues after our breakfast, a woman arrived and offered us a glass of water or ice tea for our departure. I thought , \"What great customer service!\" 
This woman was the manager. 
It was not customer service at all. The manager was \"kicking us out\" of the restaurant! She said there was a \"90 minute time limit for having your meal with ample time for conversation.\"  I asked if this policy was displayed on the menu or anywhere and she said it was not.  She explained she wanted to give \"everyone an opportunity to eat at this restaurant that was waiting to be seated\".  
In my entire life, at breakfast, lunch or dinner, have I, or my colleagues ever been asked to leave a table until we were ready to depart!!!   This is a shameful display of unprofessionalism.  Can you imagine this scenario in other place of business?  A hospital? Dentist? Dealership? I could go on and on!!! 
Well, to the Breakfast Club, we are giving you our seats. We will NEVER set foot in your restaurant again. I will be glad to share my experience in the future with anyone asking my opinion. 
Leadership should lead by example....  
Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Best French toast ever! I had the the signature French toast! Was covered In berries and nuts! I also had the ice coffee with vanilla flavoring. I'm not one to say this, but it was better then Starbucks! (Die hard Starbucks fan). We sat outside 95 degrees and the water mist on the deck was perfect! The service was fast and nice. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"The food was great but given I was there for breakfast, I was disappointed with the terrible quality of the coffee.  It tasted rather burnt or acidic."}
{"text":"Quick and easy breakfast place.  Good food and a great value too!  Would recommended!  Outdoor seating with water misters! +++"}
{"text":"Good Food and wait is waaaay better since they expanded awhile back. Staff is prompt and pleasant. If you have to wait order a beverage at the breakfast bar on the left."}
{"text":"My husband and I spend most weekend mornings in Scottsdale having breakfast. We have our usual spots, but felt like trying something new. We passed our tried and true spot and saw a bunch of open tables on the patio, but had already committed to doing something new so we kept driving and put in our name at Breakfast Club which had a 30-35 minute wait at 1130. 

After waiting for 40 minutes we were seated at a table that was way too high for the chairs on the patio. I'm 5'10 and my husband is 6'5 so I don't even know how normal sized people eat comfortably at those tables as my back was killing me then and is still sore at the end of the day.

The food tasted great and came out quick, but the menu was so boring! My rule when I eat at a restaurant is that I never order something that I could make myself in an hour or less. I broke my rule today. Like I stated, the food was great don't get me wrong, but its kind of hard to mess up an omelette or BLT. 

I won't be going back any time soon, but I wouldn't refuse to go if a friend wanted to which is why I give it a 3 star rating. Its not terrible, but it is also not something that I truly enjoyed given the long wait, uncomfortable seating, and the lack of exciting menu options.

I'll be fair and tell you what I did like about it though. What their food lacks their juice bar makes up for, they've got just about any juice you might want with breakfast. Also the food comes out really quick and is very well priced."}
{"text":"Nice place in Old Town Scottsdale, I think \"trendy\" is the word. A friend of mine and her husband have a condo near this restaurant and a recent Saturday morning was the first visit for both of us. There's a bit of a wait but apparently you can call ahead to get your name on the list, something that shortened our wait considerably. Our coffee and fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juices came very quickly and were a great start. I'm an Eggs Benedict fan and wasn't in a particularly adventurous mood so the Traditional Bene was perfect, with the hollandaise not too bland or too sour like some places. My friend also raved about her Quick Start Conscious breakfast. The waitress was efficient but not obtrusive. I'd definitely eat here again and am planning on trying one of the Southwestern specialties next time."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast place in Scottsdale.  Very hip and of course they serve a full bar so you can get a screwdriver or whatever you like with breakfast.  The breakfast sandwich was out of this world!   Service was good and I will return and/or recommend."}
{"text":"Best omelette I've had in a while! At most establishments, low carb choices for breakfast can be dicey, but the whole hog omelette was outstanding! Nice and friendly waitstaff. Will be back for sure! Wait wasn't that bad, and their smartphone texting service should be the standard at all restaurants for queuing customers."}
{"text":"Scottsdale has many great spots for Brunch, but the menu was too tempting not to stop here. Don't be too intimidated by the wait; there's a reason why everyone is at this place! The inside and outside seating options were nice for a sunny, March morning. Peruse the menu of creative breakfast options; you won't be disappointed!  Don't forget to check out the breakfast cocktails menu!"}
{"text":"Food is good in theory, but when it comes together it is not. The potatoes did not have any flavor what so ever. I ordered the Huevos con Masa AND was excited at first but when the tasted the mix of chorizo with the sweetness of the cornbread it was not that great . I would suggest other places in Scottsdale. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"This is a fun and fresh breakfast restaurant. It gets really busy and they don't have a huge space to work with so if you are going on a weekend, prepare to wait. The menu is pretty reasonable, only a little bit more expensive than your average breakfast restaurant. It's so funny how the mood in Scottsdale changes from Tempe...it seems like a lot of the customers of this restaurant have a more snobbish attitude...it's like hello, you're paying ten bucks for breakfast, not $100 so stop looking at us like we can't afford to eat here. Uggg...but what you can you do about ignorant people? So, back to the food...my favorite item on the menu here is the Chocolate Chip Pancakes. It's funny because I don't usually eat these but they are so great from here! Fluffy pancakes with just the perfect amount of chocolate. Yum-O!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant in town! Omg!!
The atmosphere is hip & lively, the service fantastic & the food incredible. I had the BC special French toast with nuts & berries; the best dish I've EVER had!!!! Portion was huge at 4 slides it they allow you to cut it down upon request. Next time I will for sure, but the quality & taste was unsurpassed. I also ordered a side of eggs & bacon. Mmmm. Delicious & cooked to perfection. 
My friend ordered the BC waffle with eggs & bacon which he said was also delicious. I would HIGHLY recommend this gem to anyone. It is a must try for anyone who's hungry for quality, value & taste. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly - servers are really nice. Started off either coffee which was really good - I decided to go with their famous French toast after reading previous reviews and so glad I did - it was SO good!!"}
{"text":"The service could have been A LOT better. I felt like we were pushed to the side and forgotten about. Honestly, the service has never been that great but, I keep coming back because the food is absolutely amazing. I will continue to come back despite the service. I highly recommend the BC french toast with fresh berries and walnuts! Mmm! My stars are for the food... NOT the service!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place to go for breakfast. So many more other options in the area and way better service. The hostesses have horrible customer service and have learned nothing on how to actually quote time to clientele appropriately. The management should be ashamed.  I guess if you enjoy bad service and subpar food choices this place is for you."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with good prices, flavorful food, and awesome drinks of teas, coffees, and mimosas."}
{"text":"Rare does it happen that a restaurant experience is either so profoundly great or terrible that I am moved to write a review.  In this case, I am writing about the latter.

Breakfast Club is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in the entire Valley.  The food quality is usually outstanding for the price, the wait staff attractive, efficient, and accommodating, and my ability to get seated and served, prompt, despite the expected usual wait of 20 minutes or so on a weekend.  But this past weekend we ended up waiting nearly TWO HOURS to be seated!!!

As usual, the food quality was great, and the wait staff courteous and helpful, particularly Jessie, who handled the situation with aplomb, and even managed to get us moved to a large table inside that accommodated all 8 of us after we were forced to separate at two outside tables across the patio from each other.  Unfortunately, the manager seemed she was over her head in terms of her sense of logistics, inability to deal with a large weekend crowd, and quite frankly, common sense.

Our family gathered for a wedding over the weekend, and the 8 of us decided to have brunch before leaving town.  I called ahead to inquire about the wait and was advised that the wait for our group of 8 was approximately 45 minutes to an hour.  The hostess offered to place us on the wait list, which I accepted and received a confirming text shortly thereafter at 10:33 a.m.  Having worked in food service, I completely understand the challenges of seating a large party, thus our decision to call ahead.  We arrived at 11:05 a.m., and were told there would be about 15 minutes more to wait.  We repeatedly checked in with the hostess stand every 20 minutes, until TWELVE FIFTEEN!!!  At wits end, and short on time, my fiancé pulled the manager aside and explained our frustration.  Finally, HE HAD TO SUGGEST breaking our party in half at two separate tables just to get some food on board before we got too \"HANGRY,\" which had long since passed for my 7 and 9 year old boys.  The manager looked surprised as if she hadn't thought of this solution.

Again, having spent years in the food service industry, I try to be super chill about problems beyond the control of the staff.  Even our servers commented that they had heard similar complaints from other patrons about ridiculous waits.  Unfortunately, the manager was so inept, my frustration really grew to the point I felt I had to write a negative YELP review.  

At no time did she 1) apologize, 2) check on us once we were finally seated and served, 3) comp a single item on our check despite a nearly $200 bill (which we still tipped 20% on!), or 4) acknowledge us before we left at roughly 2:00 p.m. to apologize for the absolutely SHITTY job she did to attend to us.  It wasn't just ineptitude she displayed, but complete stupidity.  Who lacks common sense like that in the food service industry?

Despite my anger, I love the food and ambiance, and will likely be back.  I hope very strongly that this girl is fired, because the landmark brunch restaurant in Old Town is no place for such an abject rookie.  She has reflected poorly on the entire team and undoubtedly cost the wait staff a fortune in lost tips.

I'd also be pleased to receive some sort of coupon or gift certificate, but won't get my hopes up.  Regardless, you have a brand to protect, and the young, blonde, female manager who ran the show Sunday morning August 13, 2017 is a huge liability to you and the entire staff.  She needs you to help her find her next opportunity...maybe at Denny's."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, it wasn't the best breakfast and I'd be happy to try a new place when I'm in town but I'd certainly be happy to come back.  I sat at the bar and the lady working was nice and funny.  I liked it, the breakfast burrito was good, not special, but certainly good."}
{"text":"Breakfast redeemed! Today was met with great service and great food. Nice surprise after a couple bad breakfasts and some time away.  Maybe time to add back to the rotation."}
{"text":"Update 2/23/18 - so, our usual awesome service and great food was back. Adding back my 5 stars that I took away after one visit that didn't meet expectations for service. Food never disappoints and this time Stephanie made the experience so great. I had the bird omelette with turkey and avocado - so delicious! Coffee is the best and Stephanie gave me one to go. This has been our go to breakfast place since we began our winter retreats to Scottsdale four years ago. I'm happy we came back this trip!"}
{"text":"I've come here many a time straight off a hike off Camelback Mtn, so yeah, my buddies and I certainly ain't looking pretty.  Never felt slighted.

I always get the Quick Start Conscious Breakfast, depending on someone else to order the dessert style breakfasts (Cinn Challah w/ fresh berries.. mmmm) to snag a few forkfuls from there... 

Today was a first for lunch.. the place was so relaxing and never felt rushed.  The turkey wrap was surprisingly good (not healthy boring), and the sweet potato fries should be the std for all such fries in the valley.  OMG.. I'm ordering that as a side forever more here."}
{"text":"Good place to grab breakie in Scottsdale. I had the traditional Benedict and it was quite tasty. Service was fast and friendly and the wait wasn't bad at all. We grabbed a latte from the coffee bar and sat inside for a few minutes before they had a patio table ready for us. If I return I'll try to Cinnamon Challah French Toast."}
{"text":"I know lots of people love this place, but I had the WORST blueberry pancakes I've ever had here.  

You know when you just have a jonesing for nice fluffy pancakes and you HAVE to get a fix?  Well, sadly I made the mistake of coming here.

The blueberries were *tiny* and the blueberry compote on top had a nasty saccharin-ish taste to it.

The service?  Uh, forget it.  We waited about 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  

I see the lines of people waiting outside on my way to church on Sundays, but I just don't get the appeal."}
{"text":"We both had the pancakes which were very good in size and flavor, very filling. Nice little place with good presentation. The service was fine. A little expensive, little over $30 for two people."}
{"text":"before you leave your house, make sure to check in via the waitlist app. this will eliminate any waiting! you'll thank me later. 

this place has great food with amazing presentation. i ordered the Breakfast Club Signature French Toast and it was very flavorful. the fruit kind of makes me feel like i'm eating something healthy... haha. if you're into bloody mary's or mimosas, they have them here! 


i love the selection here and everything that i've ordered didn't disappoint. my first time coming, i had to wait more than an hour so make sure to take advantage of the app. the food is great but wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've watched as more breakfast places have entered the market in old town. Breakfast club is a staple and has been here forever.  That being said its not the first place I'd pick. The eggs I've had have been undercooked.  Bacon has been good.  Recently tried the grilled cheese which was actually pretty good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the Breakfast club. It was a great place to enjoy some tasty breakfast options. I ordered the Tuscan Grinder which is more of a lunch option. Luckily we were able to use the yelp app to put ourselves in the waitlist before we got there because the wait time was 30+minutes at 9am. Everyone around us seemed to enjoy their breakfast but everything did seem a but rushed. Maybe if we had sat outside it would have been different. Overall great placr"}
{"text":"The Huevos Con Masa may be the best breakfast I've EVER had. Fresh squeezed juice was great. The staff was smiling, happy and the vibe was great. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing jalapeño biscuits and gravy on the 19th of March right before the SF/Cleveland baseball game. Sat at the counter which we love to do otherwise the wait was 30 minutes. Can not rave enough about the food and service plus the most pleasant crew. Recommend to everyone and will definitely go back. Gayle O"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today. Place is a work zone but clean. I had Huevos Rancheros. Little different from the usual I am used to but it was good. Really big portion, too much for me and I am a big eater. Food came quickly. Lots of waitresses for the size of the place though I was in early and I think when the outside tables fill up they are all humping.
Anyway nice wait staff, good food, clean. Oh and for the men out there the waitresses are all young and attractive. Sooo.... I probably won't make the trip again but if I am in the area I would definatley eat there again."}
{"text":"Great place. Have been there every few weeks with with my brother and nieces. It has been perfect every time. Love the dog friendly and very nice staff. We also love the green tea. Would recommend any time."}
{"text":"I had lunch at breakfast club with some co workers and the service was awful. Our server was very rude from the start when taking our orders. After our food was brought out she never returned back to ask how everything was or if we needed refills. I had to flag her down to ask for our checks. A few of us paid with cards, a few with cash. Those with cash did not need change back. When she brought the other checks back for signing she proceeded to say \"did I do something to not deserve a tip?\" Mind you those who paid with cash gave at least a 20% tip minus one person. She did not give those who paid with a card time to even sign their bill and enter the tip and total amount before she called our table out in the middle of the restaurant. Then she proceeded to make a nasty comment when she walked away. It was very rude and unprofessional for her to call out a table in front of other people before people even had time to determine a tip or sign their check! I understand that servers work for tips and I respect servers very much but this was beyond rude that a customer walking out at the same time as us even made a comment stating how rude she was. Needless to say we won't be returning and those who had yet to enter a tip amount BEFORE her outburst did not leave a tip after that because she did not deserve it."}
{"text":"Food was good but very spicy which I wasn't expecting until the food found my mouth. 
Service was okay, but nothing extraordinary. 
We got there and they didn't take our name for their list until after another couple entered and they took theirs first (about 5 min later). 
They didn't offer a high chair for my friends 16 month old, we eventually asked when the food came. 
And no kids menu."}
{"text":"Great service from our server, Briana! It was our first visit and I was really impressed. Food as delicious and was served quickly. Reasonably priced. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Scottsdale, AZ period! Karen and I always look forward to going to eat at the Breakfast Club in our annual Spring Training trip. Great foods and great services, highly recommend to others. 
Blue Crab Egg Benedict are the main reason why we go there.
Go A's!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast spot in the area!

As new \"locals\", we've been trying many places on a frequent basis. On Mother's Day, we decided to try this out and instantly became fans!

My #1 advice: CHECK IN via Yelp! 
 
We checked in on our way to BC and were able to receive constant updates. Once we arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes. If we would've waited to put our names down after arriving, we could've easily waited for 50 minutes or longer. There is also a parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, which is very convenient. 

Once seated, Ryan and I tried their amazing Bloody Mary! It has be one of the best Bloody Marys we've ever had! The rest of the review can be solely on the Bloody Mary but we'll move on!

Service was outstanding. Our hostess and waitress were very friendly, attentive, and quick! Our food came out  fast considering how busy it was. Everything (Salmon Bene, Pancakes, and Southwest burrito) was fresh and super delicious!

Although we sat inside, there is also outdoor & bar seating available . The restaurant is at the intersection of Scottsdale & Drinkwater- perfect for people watching ;)

I also received a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry for Mother's Day! How cute is that?! 

We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was so great... I had the jalepeno biscuits with sausage gravy, 2 scrambled eggs, fresh fruit and home fries - soooo good. Add the chipotle hot sauce they bring to the table and it is an absoultely perfect breakfast! We may even go back again before we leave Scottsdale! This is a must for anyone wanting a tasty southwestern breakfast in Scottsdale. Food and service were great - but the creativity and execution of the menu was oustanding."}
{"text":"This is a meet & greet place from the looks of the serious and not so serious conversations taking place at the tables.  Men in suits.  Or with marvelous tats.  Women in flowing Native American skirts.  Or Lulu togs.   Come as you are.  Or as you wanna be.

Breakfast is wonderful.  I liked the breakfast sandwich, stacked with a rich yellow egg, bacon, gruyere cheese, and wasabi mayo.  Coffee is dark French Press, and left in a an ergonomic, triangular pot at your table.

I think I left a dusty colored scarf with net and glitter running though it beneath the table.  If it's true that you leave something behind when you unconsciously hope to return, I'll make it back to Breakfast Club one day."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon right before closing.  Maybe that was why we didn't have a wait.  I loved how it was set up!  It was so bright, airy and clean!  It reminded me of the brunch spots in Manhattan (albeit more roomy - think of cafeteria or union sq cafe).  The employees here are all very nice.  We loved our waitress Vicky, such a sweetheart! 

The food was good and fresh.  Although the award for the best french toast in town has already been taken (sorry guys - the nuts were a little burnt but the berries were a nice touch), they still have a very tasty eggs benedict (perfectly cooked Bello Bene).  I also liked the fact that fruit and hash browns/potatoes are included in your meal (although I couldn't tell from the menu).  Nice portion size for the price of the meal.  Unfortunately the fruit/melons were not sweet at all on the day we went, but the overall experience warrants a return visit (3.5)."}
{"text":"Second visit to the chain and so far the staff is at first take one of their best assets here. They are so friendly and attentive. I ordered the standard huevos and they were off the hook!  

Fresh squeezed OJ to start and a yummy brafa, NO BETTER WAY TO START THE DAY!!!"}
{"text":"Wear your ear protection!

I imagine having breakfast next to a jet engine at 100% power would be quieter. I literally could not hear the person I was sitting next to unless I put my ear to her mouth, and NO, I'm not hard of hearing. 

Food 2 star mediocre at best but service good. Parking a challenge."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best breakfast joints in Scottsdale. They've remodeled and expanded so the space is huge and there's less wait even on a Saturday or Sunday. They have a delish assortment of breakfast, brunchy and lunchy items. I love their french toast with challah bread. They also make an incredible grilled cheese. Only complaint: the tomato soup leaves something to be desired, it's over-peppered and hard to eat.

The service is always great and the staff is extremely peppy and professional. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars!"}
{"text":"This should  be a 4 - 5 star place but I can only bring myself to give it 3 - 4 stars. I am an omelet FREAK and I love that The Breakfast Club lets you build your own...HOWEVER...even when I picked the perfect arrangement of ingredients the omelet was only okay.

I was also annoyed at the long wait when tables were empty. Oh - and the hostess was kind of a biatch too. And our waitress NEVER re-filled my drink. Hate that.

Hmmm... Now I'm remembering why only 3 stars.

I'll have to go back again and see..."}
{"text":"If you're coming on a weekend plan on a wait. Bring your newspaper, tablet whatever entertains you & be courteous. We got lucky on our last visit with just 2 & got a seat at the breakfast bar. Love the bene's & pancakes. Yum-my!"}
{"text":"I got he huevos con mass and it was Awesome!!  Cute place, went on a Sunday.  Be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Staff at our hotel recommended the BC.  Great staff, menus.  Can wait to get a table but demonstrates great place to eat."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what the big deal is about this place. It's always crowded just because the location is in a great spot. Breakfast food isn't anything to write home about. If you want runny eggs and soggy toast, this is your place. Also, as a paying customer, I don't appreciate the snotty attitude of the waitresses."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude - but if you can see past that - the staff is a-ok - but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst service and the lousiest cappuccino I have ever experienced.I dropped in here just before noon last Thursday for a cappuccino and maybe breakfast / brunch while my wife was at a seminar at the Hilton up the road.I had checked this breakfast place out earlier in the week and it looked promising.I ambled in and sat down at the big breakfast bar.The female server came straight over and said,what can I get you to drink?I must have walked into a night club or a dive bar because that's their opening line.I ordered a cappuccino and she left a menu in front of me almost as an afterthought when she brought back my coffee.It came in a square glass mug,2 inches of black coffee topped by 3 inches of white foam.I would need a bloody straw to drink that.I asked her to pour the cappuccino into a porcelain mug which at least should be round.She was very annoyed by my request and made a mess of the liquid transfer.The cappuccino tasted like shit so I was not sticking around for breakfast....that's for sure.This is not the person I would want greeting my valued customers.My wife and I enjoyed superb cappuccinos at The Chopshop just a block away the next morning."}
{"text":"This place always has such a jammin' atmosphere! Large outdoor patio and nice selection of dishes. Though everything I have eaten has tasted fine, I would come here more for the people watching than the good, but average food."}
{"text":"Perfect food, perfect atmosphere for an amazing breakfast. Asha was a perfect server as well"}
{"text":"The service and hospitality alone makes it a 5 star and the food adds to the experience.  It is a Jen of place with great breakfast.  Great choices - something for everyone and tasty.   Is my must visit once joint every time I am in Scottsdale. Keep it up guys - u have a good thing going here"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here twice in a 3 day period while visiting a friend in Scottsdale. As a breakfast lover, I was impressed with their selection of Benedicts - I had the Filet Mignon my first time eating there. The 2nd time I went I hit paydirt by ordering the Huevos Rancheros. This is everything a breakfast should be - hearty with lots of texture, seasoning and just enough spice, with two perfectly cooked eggs on top. And the plate was huge. I seriously could eat that for breakfast every day. I also appreciated their freshly pressed juice, though there was too much of it. Offering a large and a small option (that is legitimately large or small) would be helpful. Other than that, a very pleasant meal, and I didn't have any problems with service as others have mentioned. We were served quickly, and allowed to linger the 2nd day when a flash storm came. Great little breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of if not the best breakfastplace in Scottsdale/Phoenix area.    Excellent meal.  Had the egg scramble.    Others had the pancakes l and french toast.   All were amazing.   Highly recommend checking in online.   Made check in to seating very quick."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at the breakfast club.  They have a lot of breakfast options and they are all huge portions.  The food was flavorful and I really liked that my omelette came with large chunks of fresh fruit.  Overall this was a fun place to come to in Scottsdale with pretty good food."}
{"text":"you goot try the iced cafe breve (2 shots of espresson and about 8 oz of half half) very decadent, it tasted like a coffee milk shake!

the have outdoor/indoor seating and a bar area that you can order smooths, coffee, food to go

this place is pretty popular, lots of young people trying to look beautiful and cool!"}
{"text":"Bad experience & bad management! Will never return! 
Food came out cold. Had to wait for new food that was still bland and unflavored. Manager did not care about bad experience. Did nothing to rectify the situation. Will not return or recommend"}
{"text":"The food was very good, eggs as ordered, bacon was thick cut and large,rye toast was good. The food was a bit slow coming out. My wife's food was hot, mine was warm. Coffee was OK but not exceptional in any way. Fresh fruit was very good and nicely portioned. The potatoes were good but covered in bell peppers, I \"picked through\" as I'm allergic to bell peppers (wish the menu had warned me-or if it was there, that I had seen it). If my food had been 'hot' I would have given 4 stars in spite of the long time in arriving. I would echo some of the other reviewers when they say the place seems a little short staffed."}
{"text":"I love this place! A vibrant, cool vibe in the best location, this place is usually hopping. I did not know about the waitlist app, so we did have a bit of a wait. We were told the wait was about 50 minutes but in reality it was only 20 minutes. 

So rare to have delicious coffee at a busy restaurant. I assume this was because of how fresh the coffee was since the restaurant was so full.

A really large and diverse menu with much appreciated customizable size portions (many items offer 1, 2, or 3 pieces, for example, for French Toast) with really tasty add-ons such as real whipped cream (for only .25), a warm fruit compote, and nuts. My breakfast was definitely memorable!

My husband loves spicy so he ordered something with chorrizo and pepper jack cheese. He said it is the best he has ever had from a restaurant. He's a tough one to please!

For what this place offers, they excel at their niche - breakfast. A very good value for the excellent service, choices, taste, portion size, and atmosphere. We are new regulars here."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Scottsdale.  Awesome menu selections, helpful staff, and FAST service.!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance and a fun place to meet with friends. Tons of tables so the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"Meh. My friend i was visiting in Scottsdale may have ruined it for me because she talked this place up, way too high! I was just expecting to be wowed, and i was definitely not:( I was how ever impressed with how fast the service was and how quickly our food came out but it was bland bland bland. I played it safe and went with a break fast sandwich and a side of fruit. Fruit, A-ok. Sandwich, dry english muffin, over cooked egg (i wasn't even asked how i wanted it) A LOT of cheese, which is great because i love cheese more than anything - but even i thought it was a little over kill. I can't even remember if there was meat on the sandwich now that i think about it. I'm sure there was, but like i said - not wowed, i could have made that myself at home and it probably would have tasted a hellova lot better. :-/ 

Fast service. Easy menu...."}
{"text":"When its busy on a weekday morning, its a good sign.  Even with it being busy we were seated right away.  The waitress was prompt and we had our drinks right away.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it didn't disappoint.  I have nothing negative to say.  The food and service was great!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the breakfast club The food is excellent and we called ahead and they said it would be about a 20-25 minute wait when we arrived 20 minutes later we still had to wait another 40 minutes before, we where seated. This was on a Friday on the weekends we get seated in 20 minutes. Too many hostess too much talking and not paying attention."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in the heart of Scottsdale! Also the service was great and very fast paced. I must say though that the food is just average and no different than any other breakfast joint. Nothing stood out that said \"wow\" I must wait for a long time to nourish my body with that goodness. Unfortunately, just average breakfast fare. On the upside you can use the yelp app to be put on the waitlist to reduce your wait time before you even get to the restaurant. All in all, its not bad. Just average."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everytime I'm in town this is a must stop. Nice staff & great menu. Lots of healthy options as wel"}
{"text":"Great location and cool place, nearly full with diverse clientele on a Friday morning. I sat at the counter as I was dining by myself, ordered the Lean and Green Omelet. Great service, friendly staff, food was very good, although I may not have ordered the most delicious meal (i.e., I ordered the healthy omelet; plus I prefer no peppers in my potatoes, but they were good). Fruit was fresh and delicious, and my coffee cup was full. They offered to give the guy next to me a \"to go\" coffee cup, which was a nice touch. I will definitely be back with my family."}
{"text":"The wait for brunch this most recent Sunday was not too long. We did have to wait for our whole party of 10 to arrive before putting our name down so be sure all of your guests are present if you have a big party. The service was timely and our server was calm, not super excited but did her job well and made sure we were taken care of. The food was great and there was a large variety of options. They had great alcoholic beverages as well, super creative. We were able to sit down and eat in about an hour which is rare for a brunch/breakfast place at this time on a Sunday in Old Town Scottsdale! I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, my only advise is , if you are going on a Saturday call to reserve a table it get full.."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club? Wasn't that the old movie from the 80's where a group of delinquents found that they were deeper than just their surface looks? Well, unfortunately, at this Breakfast Club- it is all superficial. 

I thought with the Old Town location that this would be a good breakfast choice. And given the fact that there were people standing outside to get in at 9:15am - that is also usually a signal that a place has a following. So imagine my surprise when the food didn't live up to my expectations. 

If this review was only for Eli- the super fast, all seeing, all knowing, ever patient barrista who also minded the counter superhero, this would be a 5 star review for sure. Here's a guy who is pleasant, quick, multitasks and puts up with the most inane requests from people, all with a smile on his face. 

I sat at his counter, ordered up an espresso (perfectly made) and some breakfast. The breakfast came out post haste! I mean- I had barely cracked the binding on my book when placed in front of me was huge plate with two Eggs Benedict, a pile of melon and pineapple and breakfast potatoes with pepper and onions. 

But it was here that my dream morning came to an abrupt halt. While the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce was almost orange- not the golden buttery color associated with real hollandaise. And it was full of red pepper. If I wanted my eggs spicy- I would have ordered them that way. I wished my Eggs Benedict had come looking like the picture that is posted on Yelp. And those potatoes? Eh. Not so good. 

The people next to me ordered pancakes and bacon and had there been a contest- those would have been the big winner, for sure! 

Breakfast and an espresso ran about $18. There is plenty of parking in the lot or on the street. If you go- and want stellar service- sit at the coffee bar and have Eli take care of you. 

Great service from Eli. Friendly and accommodating host staff. But the food? I felt for a moment that I was in detention at the Breakfast Club. And that alone will have me looking elsewhere for my favorite meal of the day."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here - close walking distance to everything in Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Fashion Square, and always a big crowd - but was a bit disappointed.  With better eggs and service, this place would easily get at least four stars.

Wait: We actually scored a table really quickly, but if we had arrived five minutes later we probably would've had to wait 30 minutes.

Food: My wife got the Quick Start (2 eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and I got BC's B&G (jalapeno biscuits and sausage gravy with fontina, 2 eggs, and fruit.  At a breakfast place, making eggs is a huge element and The Breakfast Club failed us here.  Her eggs were undercooked (runny whites) and my eggs were overcooked (almost totally solid yolks when I ordered over-easy).  That aside, everything else was very good.  Covering jalapeno biscuits with eggs, fontina, and gravy was a very interesting combo and (aside from the egg fiasco) tasted very good - rich without being overwhelming.  I'd probably opt to have the eggs on the side or just forego them completely since they weren't really necessary.  What really impressed me was how fresh and sweet the fruit was - especially for March.

Service: While the hostess was nice, the service itself was far from good.  Our waitress seemed new, like a deer in headlights, and the place definitely seemed understaffed.  She came by very infrequently, and actually disappeared when we were ready for a check (maybe she went on a break?).  Fortunately - after waiting for some time - another waitress helped us and brought our check by."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is bomb. Anytime you call to place an order, they will place you on hold for 3-5 minutes, & 50% of the time they  don't return. Eat there, build your own breakfast burrito, or turkey wrap for lunch."}
{"text":"Yum! I visited this place after hiking Camelback one morning, and it was just what I needed. 

It's a relatively busy place, especially on a weekend morning, so even though it's been around for a while, I hadn't decided to check it out until recently. And I'm glad I did. Definitely expect to wait, but if you've got good company, you can hang out in their waiting area - the coffee bar - and get yourself some drinks to start with and just chit chat.

The atmosphere is lively but relaxing; easy to zone out and be in your own little universe. My friend and I ordered two different dishes we were interested in trying and split them - a challah french toast dish and an eggs benedict dish. Both were amazing! We were not disappointed. Though probably not my most favorite french toast in all my life time (I love challah french toast, only way to go), it was quite memorable and something that would encourage me to return so that I can try some of their other items; though knowing me I always seem to go back to what is tried and true.

Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Service was fast and friendly, so even though you'll most likely have to wait for a table, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I had the Belgian Buckwheat waffles and they were cooked to perfection!   Crispy on the outside with butter! Coffee was delicious.  You need to go to know!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning it was great the breakfast club sandwich is the way to go eggs bacon cheese on an English muffin and its very reasonable and fast the service was great it a great place to start your day at"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! I wish it was closer to where I live, lol.  The service was prompt and super friendly. The food was beyond delicious! I can't eat potatoes and toast and the waitress quickly substituted broccoli! Awesome! The menu is pretty varied. Would definitely come back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Club is one of my favorite weekend hangover cures. One of the reasons I like it is because they DON'T have a bar, so there's no possible way for me to order a mimosa or screwdriver. Sometimes the best way to live a healthier life is to just avoid the temptation all together. 

I've been going to Breakfast Club for years, so this review is based on several visits, not one particular experience. A lot of people dog on this place for being too \"Snottsdale\" (and I've surely seen that attitude SOME of the time), but overall, I've had good experiences here. 

First off, great bacon....thick and yummy. I suggest ordering a side order when you first sit down (you know...as a \"breakfast appetizer\"). Second, good coffee. Last, last but not least, the food. I LOVE their breakfast burrito and can't seem to order anything else. I recommend it \"Monster Style,\" smothered in pork green chile and chorizo queso. Then, I recommend that you walk about 5 miles to stave off heart failure. It's a lot of food."}
{"text":"Well my husband and I went to breakfast here. Last time was ok, food was good but service was bad. But we decided to give it another try. This time, we had jessi. She disregarded our table the majority of the morning to discuss her birthday plans with her friends, and then when she wasn't bad mouthing other servers or coworkers she hardly filled our water. Forgot to bring us any thing we asked for and I just can't believe this girl is employable at a reputable Scottsdale restaurant. We may try again in the future for the food- but this service is absolute crap."}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place after seeing such great reviews. Tried in October but they were closed so was really bummed. When friends came into for Spring Training I was so excited to see it open and busy. 

First off -- Holla for Challah French Toast! (a must order!!)
Second -- I love that they have a coffee bar, where you can wait for your table with a latte. 
Third--
It's a nice spacious place with patio seating right off of N. Scottsdale road.....and definitely a nice spot for people watching."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing! It definitely should be one your bucket list for breakfast in Scottsdale and is worth the wait. Luckily you can get in line on the Nowait app and yourself save time. 

We ordered the breakfast burrito, huevos masa, biscuits with country gravy, and the pancakes.  Everything was great and couldn't be better."}
{"text":"Delicious food and quick service. Beware of an hour to a hour and a half long wait on Sunday mornings:"}
{"text":"Really, I just don't know what's so great about the Breakfast Club. It seems like a place that belongs much more in Mesa than in Scottsdale. There's nothing wrong or terrible about the B.C., but there's nothing great about it, either. I can make a breakfast dish, or a sandwich, that's just as good -- or probably better -- at my own home. And then I wouldn't have to put up with the annoying patrons at this place."}
{"text":"Took my husband out for breakfast and didn't want to go to our typical spots. I saw Breakfast Club on yelp-4 stars and over 850 reviews-it seemed promising. Thank goodness I joined the waitlist on Yelp. It was 9 am on a Monday but there was a 20 minute wait?? I figured this place must be amazing! When we arrived, the 20 minute wait was almost done but we ended up having to wait another 10 minutes at the restaurant. It wasn't a huge pain since they have lots of tables for waiting customers. We are seated by the hostess and receive menus. Less than 20 seconds later our waitress shows up asking what we would like to drink. Not sure yet we just order waters and let her know we just arrived. She practically rolls her eyes but simultaneously plasters on a smile and says \"sure! Take your time!\" while still standing there. My husband and I look at each other and quickly order drinks, coffee and a latte. Fast forward to 10 min later and she hasn't returned with drinks or to see if we are ready to order. I guess she really meant she would be taking her time. I didn't see her helping other tables so I don't know why it took so long. She finally comes out with my husband's coffee but says my latte isn't ready yet. Quite the wait for a simple small latte...We try to order and the waitress isn't even sure of some of the items. \"Is the biscuit and gravy two biscuits or just one?\" My husband just wanted a small side. \"Umm, well the biscuit is cut in half so it's just one. Well actually maybe it's two. Haha, I don't know for sure.\" Okay...thanks? We order, another long wait, the food comes out. And after this whole ordeal, I take a bite and I'm relieved to say it tastes...JUST OKAY? I got a slice of French toast and hash browns, basic breakfast place stuff and it's just okay....Thankfully the waitress only came by once to check on us and at that time I was able to just ask for the check. This place really disappointed my husband and I. The prices are really good but the food is mediocre. I much much rather go to Matt's Big Breakfast. But obviously from its rating some people really enjoy this place! I will say that the restaurant was male dominated and almost all of the waitresses were completely arm and back baring with slightly low cut spaghetti strapped shirts. I saw another reviewer post that it's the \"Breakfast Hooters\". So I'm not sure if that's the reason why people come here. I can just say from my experience with the staff and food that I won't be back!"}
{"text":"With a name like the Breakfast Club, how could you not give this place a try!?!!

Although the wait was 45 minutes, the service was high-energy and very pleasant, especially since they let us sit at their bar and have ourselves a few breakfast cocktails until our table finally opened up.

Here's what we ordered: 

The Whole Hog Omelette - If you're into meat and eggs then this is wholeheartedly the best thing on their menu. It has the right amount of spice and flavor to compliment the nicely cooked eggs.

The Mignon Benedict with hash browns - I see where they were going with this but it really just didn't work; please leave the mignon for the steakhouse. Eating it here only made me crave it at a place that actually knows how to prepare and cook it like Bobo's in SF.

Overall, it was worth the stop and experience."}
{"text":"Border bowl it was.  It's like lunch with egg.  Plenty of protein meat selections and other fixins to complete the bowl.  Spicy sauce on the side was good, allowed for me to choose the amount I wanted, though it wasn't too spicy.  The sausage and ham were both good.  The crispiness of the hashbrowns were a bonus as well."}
{"text":"Food was great, if you go on a weekend, expect a wait!

Our service was good and the food was rather quick for how busy they were. My husband and I were trying to eat healthy and were able to modify our orders for what we wanted. I would suggest going here for brunch or breakfast! 

A good tip, if you want to avoid the line, download the nowait app, as they are on there, it saved us 45mins of waiting."}
{"text":"We knew it was going to be good given the fact that it was a 35 minutes wait on a Monday.  Definitely worth the wait.  Seriously the best pancakes I have ever had!  Prices are reasonable and service was excellent!! We also had eggs Benedict and a bagel with lox.  Everything was delicious - we are going back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I try to eat at the Breakfast Club a few times a month.  Love this place!   I'm a real breakfast fan and therefore look for good breakfast places whenever I travel, which is often.  The Breakfast Club remains one of my favorites.  Love the BC Breakfast Sandwich and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese.  The service has always been excellent and though there is often a wait, it's worth it. They are also more than happy to modify a dish to your specifications.  I typically order one of the large mimosas and the only criticism is that the orange juice is a little bitter, however I attribute that to the fact they used fresh squeezed juice which is worth the trade off."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the food's been good each time.  Have had a couple of breakfast entrees and also had the Chicken Sandwich on a wheat bagel that was good.  The service I've received hasn't been very good and the wait staff aren't very friendly."}
{"text":"Been here many times... like this place for it's lox and bagels...they are always delish...ranchos huevos are ok.  high end coffee.  wait staff is great but the hostesses are a bit dumb--look like they never went to bed after being out all night.  3-4 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped here on my last day in Scottsdale, and it was completely worth it. The omelet I tried was delicious, service was great. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Tried visiting this place last time we were in town with no luck so we decided to try earlier and were fortunate enough to get in this time. Hubby and I had the Huevos Con Masa and it was delicous! Our daughter had Chocolate Chip Pancakes and she lived them as well as the fresh orange juice. Now we know why this place is so popular, well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I really can't recommend The Breakfast Club. 

It's been on my mental \"to try\" list for awhile and I was excited to check it out for brunch with a girlfriend. I've heard it is a busy place on weekends, so I took advantage of a rare weekday off to go and try it without having to fight weekend crowds. 

Upon entering, I was impressed with the decor: a cute, bright bar borders the front area and there is a smattering of high cocktail tables with barstools in the \"Bar/lounge\" area. The buttery yellow freestanding curved booths through the center of the room are tres-cute and the cheery color scheme is complemented by the exposed brick walls - all adorable! There are windows lining one side of the dining room and an outdoor patio with umbrellas that would likely be lovely in nicer weather (but not in July) 

I showed up on time, but my friend had texted me to let me know she was running a little late. 

There was no one, I repeat NO ONE waiting when I entered the restaurant, and several free tables of varying sizes were available in the dining room. The bar area was pretty empty (I think there were a few people sitting up at the counter) 

I approached the hostess stand, where THREE hostesses were standing around, not helping anyone. I let them know that I needed a table for two, and was asked where the other person was. I explained that she was running a few minutes late and the girl haughtily advised me that \"we don't seat incomplete parties - you can wait over there until she gets here\". Over there was the bar area. I awkwardly clambered up onto one of the barstools and sat alone while alternating between staring at my phone and eying the several still empty tables in the dining room. After about 5 minutes of this, I was fed up. I get it, the Breakfast Club is a busy breakfast spot on the weekends. I bet that the \"we don't seat incomplete parties\" rule is something to live by on Saturdays and Sundays. I'm sure that they're overrun with pushy, obnoxious people demanding tables and annoying guests who camp out at tables for hours on end while waiting for their elusive additional guests who never show up. But this was a Friday, there were empty tables, and I wanted to sit down and order a drink instead of being punished by being forced to sit in their lobby since my friend hadn't gotten there yet. So, I tried again in hopes that they'd relent in light of their non busyness. But alas, the young, rude hostesses unhelpfully stuck to their guns and directed me back to the bar area. 

When my friend arrived, we were promptly seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant. We waited a considerable amount of time for a server to finally come to the table (my 10 minutes of waiting in the lobby would've been more productively spent sitting at my booth waiting for the server to finally show up - the timing would've been perfect!) 

I asked for a Diet Coke and was smugly advised that \"we don't carry any diet sodas... we have bottled natural sodas\" This was weird, but this is Scottsdale so I guess I should expect pretension (?) I switched my order to Orange Juice - flustered by the server's curt demand for the size I'd like, I mistakenly answered \"large\"... we'll revisit this in a moment. 

For my entree, I tried their BCs B&G - it seemed like one of the few interesting items on the menu, with Jalapeno Biscuits topped with fontina, sausage gravy, and eggs.. I was looking for some flavor and the jalapeno biscuits sounded like just the ticket. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There was a little hot sauce drizzled on top of the gravy, but even that was overwhelmed by the creamy blandness of the gravy, leaving the dish heavy and lacking in any sort of complexity. My friend ordered an omelet and  she remarked that it was very greasy. 

When our server dropped off the check, I learned that my large orange juice was $7.00 (!!) I took another sip of my average glass of orange juice, just to ascertain if perhaps I had groggily ordered a mimosa or screwdriver in lieu of my standard OJ... NOPE! Regular orange juice = $7.00, guys. FYI. 

I can't pinpoint what I disliked most about sitting by my lonesome little self in the bar...perhaps it was that it was morning and while I'm not a big bar person generally, I'm particularly less bar-ish before noon. Perhaps it was being isolated as though I was being made an example of. Maybe it was my time spent puzzling over the decision to alienate a customer after they've barely crossed the threshold of the restaurant. Or maybe it was that I was being treated like I was trying to get into an exclusive nightclub when really it was just a mediocre, overpriced breakfast restaurant. Regardless, it absolutely ruined my visit. I could continue regaling you with my thoughts on this awful experience, but I've got to get back to my busy schedule of studiously avoiding The Breakfast Club for any and all meals for the rest of my life.  Ciao!"}
{"text":"Breakfast club was a nice breakfast spot in OldTown Scottsdale. They have a good menu with quality breakfast items that were reasonably priced. The food was good, nothing special however. When I ordered coffee, it came out cold, but the waitress replaced it quickly. The staff was friendly but service was average. Overall it was good, but nothing special. Good spot to bring co-workers or friends. Oh there might be a little wait early morning and during lunch time."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Scottsdale! Huge portions, not lacking quality in anyway! Service is so nice and coffee delish! the new renovation makes it hip, classy and fun! Love the new \"bar\"! Lunch is also incredible!!!! You will wait on the weekend for a table, but get a latte at the bar and wait, it's well worth it!!!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good eggs Benedict.
Long wait , get there early because place gets packed!!
Dont get the bloody Mary, it is not good! Get some mimosas instead or a smoothie! 
There is parking in the back if you are lucky to find a spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! I wish they had one at home!

I got an enormous iced coffee (house cold press hazelnut and caramel) for only $5!!! 

I got The Bird omelette, filled with fresh sliced turkey, avocado, mushrooms and crème fraîche, potatoes o'brien and fresh fruit. 

It was a freaking TON of food for $10/$11 - I should have shared with my boyfriend. I had to tap out 2/3 of the way though my omelette, hardly touched my potatoes and ate my pineapple slice and watermelon slice. Totally worth the money, great service and wonderful atmosphere. 

I look forward to visiting again in the future!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast....portions as big as what I experienced at Hash House a Go Go in San Diego....

Omelets and pancakes were great.  Have had the oatmeal here on another occassion - served with all of the fixins...can't really mess up on the oatmeal....

Arrived before the huge morning crowd.  

Great place to people watch and to walk around afterwards- lends itself to a great location.....

Wanted a t-shirt to this place, but was not willing to spend forty something for it...."}
{"text":"I frequent BC for brunch and love their food! They have a great, diverse menu of delicious food but I personally recommend the biscuits and gravy. Their drinks are tasty, though they are a little pricy. My one issue with BC is spotty service. Some of the servers don't seem to care very much and depending on who you get, you may never see your waitress the whole time. It is not uncommon for them to disappear for a long time and you end up with empty drink glasses or wait a long time to order. I'm not sure if it is an issue with management or if they are perpetually understaffed. If you plan to go on a weekend day, I recommend calling ahead of time, seeing how long the wait is, and getting on the list. On a Saturday or Sunday, it can easily be 30-45 minutes and you can save yourself a lot of time by calling!"}
{"text":"This is place is awesome! The food was really good and the service was exceptional. Our waitress was really sweet and provided amazing service. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and is so good. Looking forward to eating their again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service is fast.  We get there early but get there after 830 on a weekend day and be prepared to wait, BUT, grab coffee there and enjoy the people watching, well worth the wait, the staff is fast!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere! Gathered with friends and family who also have never been, and we had a blast. Hardly had to wait to be seated and food came out hot! Will certainly be back. Thanks to our amazing server. Can't remember her name but she was tall and with brown hair, you were great!!! (:"}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast with my VIP David G this morning.   Alicia took care of us (with pride and confidence).  The food and the people are so delicious and beautiful here.  I was impressed: this organization recently remodeled.  It wasn't long after that it became one of the most popular eating establishments in Scottsdale.  I chose the three egg omelet with turkey sausage, mushrooms and jalapenos.  The only changes I will make; I wish to stay longer and visit more often.  David G; when can we breakfast here again?"}
{"text":"One of the more hip breakfast places around, The Breakfast Club can get crowded on weekends with a sceney bunch.  They have great eggs benedicts - about 5 different types one of which comes with steak instead of ham.  

Always had a decent experience here, until recently when the Scottsdale blondie server gal was aloof the entire time and tried to stiff us on the tip.  The bill was $32, we gave her $40 and she tried to avoid coming back to face us - as if we'd leave.  Coincidentally she was within sight in the kitchen flirting with a guy server - giving him some back-scratching action.  We finally caught a busser to flag her down.  NO WAY SISTA...The customer decides what your tip should be - not YOU.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday morning after dropping off my vehicle for service.  The food was great, was seated right away.  Prices are reasonable since it's located in Old Town Scottsdale.  The only downside to the restaurant was the service was pretty horrible.  Might try it again in the future, but as of now, no thanks."}
{"text":"Every time my parents come in from out of town, they are always wanting to go here for breakfast. This place does get busy very early in the morning. The wait for a table isn't bad, sometimes it goes by quick where as other times it does not. At the end it is worth the wait. 

Every time I go here I get the bagel and lox here, it it is very tasty. In addition, the food does come out at a timely matter.

The service is very quick and on top of their game. They are always refilling your water/Coffee or whatever drink you got."}
{"text":"Why the HECK do people stand in line for so long to eat this food?

On a corner in old town scottsdale is this seemingly cute local joint for breakfast.  Under the awnings outside,  you see people waiting in line, lounging around, waiting for a table.  Wow, with these reviews and that line, the food must be great!  You give the friendly waitress your name and wait.  It's old town, so the wait is pleasurable; with your estimated wait time, you can walk around, enjoy the sights and gorgeous waterfront area, and meander back, grab a drink...in all honesty, the wait, even at an hour, goes well because there is enough to see and do.

Once you get inside you begin to realize that this place isn't that special.   Tables and chairs in a casual area.  Denny's has more comfortable benches, those these natural tree table tops look much cooler.  Your waitress is super friendly and you love the quick service, after you figure out that the girl in the VS sweatpants really does work there and will be serving your food.  The glittery PINK pants make it easy to find her when you want a refill anyway, although she's super fast and never leaves you with an empty glass.

The menu has many options, so perhaps you should give other options a try.  If you go with the traditional eggs, meat, toast, you won't get anything special.  In fact, your food at home probably tastes better, except you wouldn't put such pretty slices of fruit arranged just so  on your own plate at home.  The omelette is good, but seriously, were you that lazy that you preferred to wait for an hour and spent $6 for a basic nothing-special concoction?

When the bill comes, you're happy that the damage isn't bad and you can walk over to Nordstrom guilt free... but next time you're hungry in the morning after a run through old town, perhaps you'll just wait for Nordstrom to open and have one of their amazing meals instead."}
{"text":"Ok, I am a big breakfast fan, trust me.  I have not had a good experience at this place.  First of all, when you drive down Scottsdale Road, you can see the lines forming outside and you would think that the Rolling Stones were in concert inside performing!!  Well, when I certainly can't get no satisfaction when it came to the food.  First of all, the service was a little frantic.  There were a ton of annoying \"I think I am cool\" people who were obviously hungover from \"clubbing\" in the Scottsdale scene the night before and all wearing sunglasses and tried to look like Paris Hilton and Nick Lashay.  Oh,  well.  As for the food, I ordered the huevos rancheros.  My friend told me that it looked like somebody vomited in a large tortilla!!  I had to agree, he was right.  The eggs were undercooked and the whites were very runny!  I was DISGUSTED!!  My friend ordered a pancake and that looked ok.  Don't order the orange juice here, they will charge you and ARM & A LEG!  So, bottom line...if you like long lines and enjoy watching the Scottsdale party girls and guys nurse their hangovers as they text and show off their sunglasses and then eat, this is the place for you.  If you want a good ol' fashion American breakfast, this place may not be for you.  Go to Denny's instead!  :)"}
{"text":"Early morning visit on a Thursday morning...no wait, easy parking.
(We've been here on a Sat morning & contended with a 45\" wait, but it was managed with a 'no wait' app successfully...crossed the street and had Bloody Mary there during the wait!)
This morning: I enjoyed a large freshly squeezed OJ & my wife had a bottomless coffee.  I had the Biscuits & Gravy and she had a single slice of French Toast with blueberry compote.  Both were hot, flavorful, and sizable.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast nut like my gal Nydi, but when I am feeling HUNGRY after a long night out there is nothing like some greasy wholesome breakfast food!  

What sets Breakfast Club (BC) apart is the younger crowd and the lively vibe, and quite frankly just about everyone in the room seems to be in the same state I am when I stroll in here on the weekends...except the few random tourists.  The two servers I recently had here were fabulous and quite funny as well.  Sometimes I feel like they need background music in here though, I felt like I was very aware of everybody's conversation around me.  And heaven forbid anybody have to listen to me and my friends' ridiculous conversations...Although on the flip side I have met some cool neighborly people in the BC due to this feature.  

My other complaint is there will most certainly be a wait.  However I guess that is to be expected in this busy part of town and a testament to their sound and hearty breakfast grub!  I usually just have crispy bacon and hash browns at the BC, but I can say all my friends have had some impressive and yummy breakfast dishes for a reasonable price!  I also highly recommend their hazelnut iced coffee; my server recommended it to me last time and it is now a staple when I come the the BC!"}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy a nice breakfast place, this is not for you. Worst service I've ever received! The food was ok. Wait was long and then they just wanted to rush us out as soon as we were done eating. The staff acted petty and too good for everyone. When we kindly asked for a manager to explain how we were treated, we were completely dismissed. I honestly have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant. If you are in the area and want breakfast, I suggest you go to the McDonalds down the street. You will at least be treated like a human being and get better food than this place has to offer! *Disclaimer: I'm not knocking on McDonalds, just saying that this so called \"nice\" restaurant will be a waste of your time and money."}
{"text":"Very good food.  At first I thought the special french toast was overpriced, but once I saw it, I didn't think that anymore - it's a huge plate, with lots of fresh berries and nuts.  The make your own omelet I picked (lox, tomatoes, capers) was delicious, as were the bacon and potatoes.  We'd definitely return.  It was also nice that the waitress offered me a coffee to go when I said no to a refill.

Edited to add:  added our name to the waitlist via Yelp, and it was great - nowhere near as long a wait as it would have been otherwise."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent. 

She spoke clearly and was very efficient. I believe she got all our orders correct including a substitution.

2 pm \"brunch\" for our party of 8 after a hike up Camelback Mountain was awesome. All the food was hot, tasty, and arrived at the table around the same time. 

I'm really glad I tried their V-18 veggie juice mix. I'm drinking a bottled V-8 spicy juice mix right now at home and it's making me sad. V-8 is watery & weak. BC's V-18 juice is spicy, flavorful, and very fresh tasting. 

The eggs benedict with filet worth it. The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned. The server was really nice when I asked if the regular melon fruit cup could be replaced with other fruit due to a melon allergy. Pancakes were pretty solid for restaurant pancakes.

Overall, it was about $20 per person."}
{"text":"The decor is nice. Open and spacious. 

Ordered the egg Benedict and 2 bacon egg toast breakfast. Maybe I was  expecting too much. Not the best. The hollandaise sauce was mediocre at best.

The service was lacking. Place was half empty since we went during \"off hours\" yet our waitress managed to ignore us. 

The two stars are for the decor and location."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of this place. Took my boyfriend here last minute at 2:45 even though they close at 3.. Right away we order: me the regular breakfast, which I got scrambled eggs and sourdough bread and my boyfriend the lox plate. I have always remembered they have fast service, and they lived up to my expectation once again. Everything was perfect and so fresh. Must come back again soon. I forgot how good it was! 

I also love the ambience. Very clean and has a good Scottsdale feel. I remember a few years ago when they revamped the place, and it's looking better than ever."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place, and I had to ck it out! Great location and setup, food was amazing and pricing was fair. I will definitely make this \"A MUST\" every time I go  to Scottsdale. Thanks again for the great service Ve!"}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus.  

I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  The bread was delcious, tasted homemade.  However, there was way too much cheese, and it wasn't fully melted.  

My g/f had the eggs benedict, which looked really good.  She said it was really good, and filling.  

3 stars.  I've had better.  I've had worse.  La de da."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that the hostesses was amazing. She was beyond amazing and help me choose my seat, my meal and made some amazing conversation. 

Second, the food was good, it could've been better if my waitress wasn't such a rude person. She drops my food off and walks away. No smile, no hello, nothing. I watch as she interacts with every other customer, she chats away and seems to have a grand old time. Meanwhile she makes no attempt at a conversation. 

Third, drops off the check, I pay, she brings it back, still no conversation. It felt like I was given the bums rush. Such a shitty experience, maybe the hostess should be the waitress, she definitely has the people skills for it. Also I'm glad your location is next to PHX start up hub... This will cause for some interesting business if you continue to hire shitty waitress."}
{"text":"Looking for a new place for breakfast, opened yelp and found places nearby. Had to smile at the name. Loved the fact that you could get on the waitlist before hand. Started out with a breakfast cocktail, the Rest.Redeem.Repeat. Was good but nothing to write home about. Table was ready and we chose to sit on the patio, it was gorgeous out. Not surprised they were dog friendly, another plus. Menu was simple and easy to read. Chose the Border Bowl and the Bananas Foster French toast, coffee and fresh squeezed OJ. The Border bowl was outstanding, a new favorite. A little Spicy, and great flavors. I was sad when it was gone, lol. The French toast, another great surprise. It was sweet, as you would expect, but not over the top. Coffee was ok and the OJ was definitely fresh. The waitress was polite and checked on us just enough not to be to intrusive. Great place for Breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is the first time being here. Awesome food! I had the Bagel and lox. My husband had the Whole hog omelet. It was amazing!! Or waitress Emily is very attentive, always making sure my husband had plenty of coffee. I had the black ice tea. This is a must for breakfast. We only had a ten minute wait. Come and enjoy you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance. Lively place, courteous staff, nice assortment on the menu items."}
{"text":"Thanks to a friend for recommending this place. Perfect to start your day with a hearty breakfast. I had the whole hog omelet. This piece of art had Ham, bacon, sausage chorizo and pepper jack cheese with a drizzled creme on top. It was huge and delicious. The juice is fresh and helped wash everything down. Good service and food at reasonable prices. I will return"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and was very excited to try it. All of the food is really fresh and good quality, and is prepared perfectly. Their iced BC coffee is delicious and I am not even a big coffee drinker. The bacon is perfect and their sandwiches are delicious on bread or a bagel. 

The service is great and extremely quick. They get you what you need and are fast.

Awesome place and I recommend it for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great, see-and-be-seen Joint with a pretentious attitude regarding their vibe/food. Frankly, after all the raves and top tens, I expected more. Blueberry pancakes -- good. Bacon -- very good. Eggs -- runny (ordered over-medium). Fresh fruit -- very good.

While eating our breakfast, my wife and I were lamenting that we didn't go back to the Daily Dose, one block down. Again, the BC was good, but just good.
Live and learn."}
{"text":"Wow, great Brunch. Being from Texas I like hot food, their hot sauce is up there. Wife had the Challah French toast and I had the Breakfast burrito both great!  Go ahead and put yourself on waitlist on weekends and show up 10 mins before. Good reason this place has a long wait. Definitely try it."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday at 11AM and of course it was very crowded. We waited for almost 40 minutes for a party of four table. Food came surprisingly quick, about 10 minutes after we sat down. Menu is sort of pricey, well, mostly because it's in Old Town Scottsdale, but the food portion is pretty generous. We tried the Quick Start Conscious which has 4 eggs and a lot of veggies and a bowl of cottage cheese. it's pretty good, very fresh. My cousin tried Border Omelet, or something like that, which tuned out to be a tex-mex type of food. It's huge, and delicious. 

So, besides the long wait, everything else is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Best service and steak and eggs in town. It is my new go to spot for breakfast. I like sitting at the counter. You get 3 eggs and fried potatoes laced with peppers and onions; along with a good sized steak cooked to perfection. The mocha coffee was also amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING 
Allows dogs outside which is great! Generous pours for the mimosas!! Amazing verde sauce and coffee bar selections!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at 1030 and there was a 45min to 1 hour wait my expectations were raised.  And they were met.  BC uses the nowait app which can cut down on line time.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Excellent service.  The fresh squeezed lemonade and apple juice were superb.  The French toast had an excellent rich vanilla flavor.  The Dip sandwich meat was perfect and the flavor wonderful.  The huevos con masa had a rich spicy flavor that was very satisfying.  The only real drawback is how loud the dining area is, as it makes it hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"One star is bc Im not into  having to yell over the music to talk w my friends. . 4 stars for food & service."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite brunch places. 

I've been coming here a lot with my friend and we've gotten excellent service, food and drinks each time. The servers are always quick and friendly. The drinks are huge for only $10! Can't beat a huge mimosa for that price! My friend and I always get the same thing because it's so good. I've been getting the Tuscan omelet with adding sausage and I can't get enough. I can't describe how good the omelet is. It's so unique it's delish. I love pesto and this omelet is covered in it with tomatoes and mozzarella. There is no meat so be sure to add some if that's your sort of thing. And those potato skins with peppers oh my gosh. 

Writing this review is making me hungry and I just decided that I'm going here this weekend. I can't resist! 

Edit. Every time we're here the severs who are ready to leave steal our salt and pepper mid meal and it's getting obnoxious. We come here a lot and it happens every time. They don't even ask me which bugs me even more. Im still eating I expect to be able to keep my condiments. There's plenty of empty tables they can fill im not sure why they need mine as well right away considering they are hours from closing.."}
{"text":"Brunch here was okay but maybe was expecting it to be a lot better. We were sat outside and our waitress quickly came right over. I had an Arnold Palmer and my friend had a lemonade. We ordered our food which surprisingly came out quick! I had a breakfast grilled cheese sandwich and my friend had the quick start loaded. 
The food was bland and I found myself drowning it in pepper, Tabasco sauce, and salt to give it a kick. I also ordered a full order of pancakes which tasted like pancakes from home. Nothing that really stood out from this place. IHOP is better. Paid about $40."}
{"text":"Eh! Wasn't that impressed. Maybe I set my expectations a little too high for this place. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, and had mostly lettuce on my plate. Great presentation, but lots of lettuce under my Huevos. No guac and no sour cream, figured that was standard for Huevos Rancheros. Also, my service wasn't great. She seemed hurried and no too engaged with our table. Very bland! Although the food wasn't anything to rave about, with a little more engagement/interest from our waitress, Jessi, this could've made my experience that much better and a 4 star review. 

P.s Their Orange juice was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday and they were super busy even at 1pm.  We waited for a little bit for a table, but the food came out quickly.  We ordered the eggs benedict which was very good.  The egg was a little too runny for my taste (the yolk just gushed out when cut), but the hollandaise was scrumptious.  The best was the nutty waffle!  Sweet, but not overly so.  Candied nuts on a hot crispy yet soft waffle. Delicious.  I'll be back to try some other waffles!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised by the good reviews. I went for brunch on a busy weekend and had to wait quite awhile. I have no problem with that. 

My disappointment lies with the apparent lack of skill in the kitchen. I ordered a custom omelette with spinach and bacon. Sounds simple and tasty, right? Well, they ruined it. There was NO seasoning at all. I NEVER add salt to meals, but had to to make it at all palatable. The hash was also bland. 

Our waitress seemed especially dim. I wonder if they primarily hire girls who couldn't get into college. I didn't see a single male employee and no female employee looked to be older than 25. 

There were two tables of LOUD frat boys behind us, which didn't improve the experience at all. 

It seems like the place is overrun with inexperienced people. They turn over tables quickly, but I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place today, the hostess took our phone number stated a 40-45 minute wait. 

But she obviously had her VIPs and buddy's seated first. We watched as groups that came in after us got seated and they put tables together for them.

NEVER AGAIN AT THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here this a.m. for the first time.  The food was good although the coffee was bland.

As it was crowded, and due to the (faux?) brick walls, etc.,  the noise level was beyond what I can tolerate for breakfast.  So, we exited as soon as possible.

We probably will only eat here again when the restaurant is not packed."}
{"text":"Great place. Had the breakfast Burrito. My wife and I go here on our birthdays. The food is always good and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and good juice.  had to wait 30 minutes due to the many people wanting to eat there. fast and good service.  Orange juice was $4 and expense, but worth the price.  good value."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast in the trendy east Hollywood neighborhood of Scottsdale.  Hands down best mimosas due to the temperature and the fresh squeezed OJ.  Staff is extremely friendly and service is top notch.  The burrito bowl is excellent, as is the huevos rancheros.  Their omelettes are galactic, overflowing off the plate.  Fresh fruit is fresh - now there's a statement.  Coffee is a little bland, but the beauty of the Arizona desert more than makes up for that.  Get a mimosa."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-The Breakfast Club (not the movie) in Scottsdale is easy to find.
-It's on the corner of Scottsdale Road & Drinkwater Boulevard.
-It's modern in design w/ great tasting breakfast items, juices & coffee.
-It's the perfect place to stop by after hiking Camelback Mountain.
-This place does get busy, but if you use the Yelp app you can sign up on the waiting list.
-I was able to do this & by the time I got there was ready to be seated by the lovely hostesses.
-The Chicken Fried Chicken was a guilty pleasure, but so worth ordering.
-The batter was perfectly fried to an excellent brown crisp & wasn't salty.
-At only $11 it's a steal.
-My brother ordered a fruit bowl & some fresh squeezed juice along w/ a plate of Biscuits & Gravy.

Overall, the service is very attentive and I plan on coming back again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, nothing special. I had pancakes with mixed berries ($2 extra for about 10 berries on top), fried eggs, and hash browns. I liked it all, but honestly it seemed just a step above IHOP. Really nothing great about the quality, flavor, or the service."}
{"text":"Excellent everything!!  Service, food, atmosphere, prices--EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!!  You must try it - you will not be disappointed. 
\"The Breakfast Yelpers Crew\""}
{"text":"Crowded for a Monday morning... but the service was wonderful, the food came out fast, and it was absolutely delicious! My friend recommended this place knowing I only had a few days in Scottsdale and it was a home run!"}
{"text":"I love the Breakfast Club. I go to Spring Training in Scottsdale for a week every year and I eat at the BC every morning. I take a nice long walk along the canal to get my appetite ready (and to stave off those future calories) I am by myself so I sit at the counter. Wait has never been more than a few minutes to get a seat. Some mornings I have the \"quick start\" (2 eggs/bacon/fruit /toast) The pancakes are wonderful too, The yogurt with fruit and granola is excellent (and healthy!) My downfall is the biscuit with sausage gravy. (I just get the side) it's sinfully good. The wait staff are super fast and remarkably good looking (I am a 70 y.o.female) One waitress in particular (I believe her name is Alex?? No name tag) Beautiful girl and fantastic waitress. My son has joined me one morning (after hiking Camelback) and had the traditional Benedict. He loved it too,"}
{"text":"Where do I start? A beautiful morning needed some good breakfast a couple of my friends suggested to come here. Me I did not want to because of the 3 and half stars on Yelp and reading a couple of reviews. But I always like to try places because everyone has a different opinion. We got there and they told us a 45 minute wait. It was nice outside so we suggested to wait because any place would be busy at that time. So we waited the 45 minutes and they call us inside. I look at the menu and I had no idea what to order. No like suggestions or Stars by popular plates how most places have it now. So I asked our waitress she gave me a couple options and I went with Border Bowl. From the description it sounded amazing. Bacon, ham, hash browns, etc. So I ordered that and their tomato soup. The soup wasn't soup it was like tomato sauce from a can.. Literally.. And right when my plate came out I looked for my bacon. I then found out it's like shredded bacon.. Very disappointed. The description didn't explain any of it or have any pictures. So I ate and I can eat a lot of food. On my 6th bite I couldn't do it. My stomach wasn't allowing it. It wasn't really bad. It just wasn't acceptable. My friends ordered the same thing and felt the same way. So I paid my 25$ breakfast.. Didn't know I had filet mignon. My stomach did not accept any of this food. I wanted to get it out of my system so bad but I just couldn't. I really was disappointed and im truly never coming back here again. Also the iced coffee there's a big poster outside about it and it looked so good and it has a special name so I thought this ice coffee was going to be BA. I think McDonald's ice coffee is better. Just truly wasn't satisfied. At least the women are good looking but got an attitude. Customer service was alright. 2 star joint. I would prefer something different maybe McDonald's breakfast?"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the service was quick. On a Friday morning about 11:30 we got seated immediately.  May I suggest the French toast?  Best French toast I've ever had hands down. Looking for breakfast. Come here. Not sure how this place is not at least 4-4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing out of this world. Decent breakfast food but the kitchen is a bit of a mess as
Well as the staff. Screwed up an order of eggs \"over medium\" and they came out sunny side up. When I asked for them to redo it so it's over medium, the answer was \"that is over medium\".  So I had to explain the difference between sunny side up/over easy over medium and over hard. They said they have their own definition of over medium. They came back out still over easy. The pancakes were good l, but if you can't cook eggs right multiple times I don't know what to say."}
{"text":"Breakfast places are my thing. Once I find one that I enjoy, forgetaboutit. It could be my coffee addiction. But all the same, a place that does a great cup of coffee and breakfast gets high marks in my portfolio.

Candidly, The Breakfast Club always intimidated me - the crowd that is there all day long. Because, let's be honest, if a place is THAT crowded all the time, it has to be fantastic, right? I didn't get it, for the longest time...then there was Eli. 

I sidled up to the coffee bar, a nervous wreck. I wasn't sure if this was a place I could eat, drink, both, or if it was for Take Out (by the way, its all of the above). And, I started to ask questions. Eli is his name. It seems that he runs this joint on the weekends and he's got one hell of an ear (read: don't gossip about anyone or anything) and a smarty-pants sense of humor; but, he was open to questions and he lead me through all the ins and outs of the Breakfast Club. 

My biggest piece(s) of advise: Use The Boards. They are not just for decor and their kitchen will make anything for you. Make your own omelette. Add a side of green chili to anything. Order a drink from Eli on a weekend day. Sit at the back bar and eat, read your paper, eat your Lox, and have a second cappuccino. Is it perfect? Is anyone? Probably not, but now that I've seen how they intended the restaurant to be used, I understand the crowd and I'm one of the many that will return..."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was fun to meet up with some fellow Yelpers for a top secret UYE. Actually it was a great opportunity to meet Larry W from CA/TX as he drove through on his way back home. COOL!

We arrived on a Saturday around Noonish and the place was super packed. They had a pretty good wait list and everyone outside looked very hungry.

Ordered the Border Bowl and a giant glass of freshly squeezed OJ. Other members went with the Whole Hog plate, Eggs Benedict, a Caesar Chicken Wrap and some type of Veggie Dish.

Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. The fresh squeezed OJ was definitely good and something I've not had in a long time. The Bloody Marys looked fantastic and were giant.

We all had a great time visiting and the service was excellent. The menu has something for everyone and this would be a place that I'd bring the family back for a special occasion.

The parking can be a little tricky and it is mostly behind the building. Just take you time and be careful driving in this part of town. The locals are pretty crazy and some of the streets nearby go around in circles. Dang shopping malls.

See ya there next time and remember you can eat breakfast at any time of the day. There is no real written rule. ORDER UP!

4 STARS"}
{"text":"We tried a sitdown breakfast today with very good results. As long as you arrive early (before 9am), you will enjoy no waiting in line. The outdoor patio is dog friendly and the cars going bye on Scottsdale road are noisy, so sit inside. The signature french toast was pricey at $14, but the combination of the fresh fruits and walnuts and cinnamon made this a special dish. Also tried an omlette called the bird made with real fresh turkey and huge chunks of avocado. The potatoes had fresh cut onions and peppers and were a nice addition. They are very nice here and give you free refills on iced coffee during meal and after you leave also. One of the better breakfast spots in town if you get there early enough."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best green chile pork I have ever had, and I try it wherever I go. The service was fabulous also."}
{"text":"Great restaurant but they ruined the sausage several years ago, it doesn't taste the same, less flavor. Waffles are great bacon great. The wait can be annoying."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat for breakfast!  They always have healthy options, which I love, & the staff is so friendly!  Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Here is what we ordered: 
Ham and Eggs and Steak and Eggs. 

Both came with toast and fresh fruit. 

I ordered the ham and eggs, and ordered my eggs \"over well\" and asked the waitress to have my yolks popped, because the sight of egg yolk running around my plate makes me ill. She had a little tude about \"over hard\" versus \"over well\", but I thought we had it settled...

My eggs came burned, with brown crispy crap all over them, and they were not hot. The toast came cold, with no butter or jam. The ham was okay, but \"off the bone\" is an exaggeration. The fresh fruit was good. 

My husband's eggs and steak were not hot, and his toast came cold, with no butter or jam, as well. 

He complained, and the waitress said she would bring new orders to us, at which time I told her to just forget it as far as my order went, because I was STARVING. She brought me a new order of eggs, and I said that I didn't want them, and off in a huff she went. 

When my husband's (new) breakfast was delivered to the table, it was hot and everything was done correctly. However, no toast was present. 

What bugs me about this place, besides the fact that we both were served cold food, is the attitude of the waitress. 

Yeah, I get it, it's Scottsdale, but as a Scottsdale resident, I am embarrassed by the holier-than-thou attitude you get from some of the businesses here. 

We hadn't been here in years, and now I know why.

Despite the long drive, we'll head back to Matt's Big Breakfast, which has THE freshest, most delicious breakfast in this area. And, no attitude..."}

Location: perfect if staying in scottsdale.

{"text":"Food is stil good, but the remodel is not for me - too spacey and cold - not my style - I like cosy with breakfast, thanks for not changing the menu - hubby loves your pancakes - we will come in on accasion when he needs a pancake fix."}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this place for quite sometime but its usually so busy that we dont dare try to find a parking space.  Today didnt look so bad unfortunately :-)  Wish we had tried the Daily Dose instead.  Oh well theres always next time.  These reviews are hilarious.  Made the mistake of not reading them before hand.  The service sucked.  The waitress sucked.  She really pissed me off.  My husband had to keep reminding me the girl was young and what if that was your daughter cuz I wanted to punch her in the face.  It took forever just to be acknowledged, waited a lifetime for some water.  Asked her what was good on menu this is our first visit.  Too bad we took her advice.  My husband got the bird omelet which I tasted and YUCK.  It was completely bland.  He had to pour hot sauce all over it for flavor.  They put the eggs right on top of the fresh cold fruit so that now you cant eat it or wouldnt want to eat it.  If they just read their own reviews they would stop doing that.  Talk about dumb asses.  I got the huevos rancheros with green chili.  It comes in an open chipotle tortilla that is MINUS any taste.  Its swimming in juices which is making the tasteless tortilla into glue.  Comes with two eggs on top.  The flavors together were just not that good.  Got a $4 glass of fresh squeezed orange juice that made my face scrunch up because of the bitterness.  Waitress brought bill way too early obviously trying to get rid of us but that just pisses me off even further cuz thats her ticket to not having to do shit.  I waived that bitch down anyway.  I want water bitch.  The only reason they get 2 whole stars is because the green chili was good otherwise hate this place :-)"}
{"text":"Very generous portions of really tasty comfort food. Come ready to eat! There's a private parking lot immediately behind the restaurant but can get full pretty early in the day.  However, there's a nearby public lot as well as ample street parking.

Servers can be hit or miss. First day was not so great with not much service after placing order for food. Second day was much better, with a friendly, efficient server.

Can also get a to-go cup if you order coffee as part of your meal.  And building your own meal with the side menus is also an option."}
{"text":"YUMMY BREAKFAST/BRUNCH place to eat at! Great service too! Definitely would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Yeah guys,  this is definitely a breakfast spot. If you've never been....warning! You will wait a looong time on Saturday & Sunday morning. The huevos rancheros  and breakfast burrito (shown in photos) are slamming! The omelets are delish and the side of fruit is almost always sweet. 
If I order lunch, I typically just get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I must warn that the tomato soup is more brothy than creamy. The salads are ok but not worth the 45min table wait. The prices are great for the quantity and quality of the food (breakfast). 



Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"A delicious, affordable place to go for breakfast...and my favorite part: your pooch can enjoy the patio with you!  Breakfast was very straightforward, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I chose a short stack of whole wheat pancakes and a side of hashbrowns, while my date chose the cinnamon challah french toast.  My order was perfection simply because of the portion size...the pancakes were much smaller than those in the full order, and came with three.  I was actually able to eat them all instead of wasting a lot, as I normally do with a small appetite...and for $3.50, it was fantastic.  The hashbrowns were also crisp and well seasoned.  As for the french toast, other reviewers have described it, and I agree with them:  a little dry, but nothing a dousing of syrup can't cure.  The crunchy almonds and fresh berries on top are a great touch.

My iced vanilla latte was delicious, and my pup enjoyed the misters on the patio.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The Starbucks of Breakfast. They Signature French Toast was from another world. I have been here maybe a dozen times and have never been disappointed. \"Must Go\" in you are ever in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Look back at my reviews. How many 1 stars do you see? None.  And I would have written a lot more reviews lately except I'm about to give up on Yelp due to their lack of action defending businesses against political attacks. But I digress.
    
   The Breakfast Club! Yes, that's why I'm here today.  Never again. 
  My girlfriend and I both saw the 'Wild mushroom' omelette at the same time and each ordered one.  I'll start with hers.
        She asked for some spinach added to hers. It comes out and obviously looks different than mine. No creme fraiche, or cheese. Though she did get the potatoes O'Brien with them.  Okay,  we'll ask about that when the waitress comes back.  After I got her attention, eventually, she explained that there were no substitutions allowed so she wound up with a 'build you're own'. Which meant crimini shromms. Would have been nice to know that adding one ingredient constitutes a 'substitution'.  I'll get back to that in a minute. 
   My order.  I noticed a lot of water coming out from the folds, and looking inside I saw only crimini mushrooms. Hardly what I would call wild. Certainly were no oyster, shiitake, etc... that were supposed to be there.  I guess if the kitchen wants to substitute unilaterally it's acceptable.  
   I mentioned this to the waitress and got a blank look.  No explanation, just excuses.  No offer to take it back and fix it. No price reduction. Nothing. 
   
   The only reason I didn't walk out is because I was very hungry, so I cleaned my plate. I didn't want to cause a scene that would have embarrassed my girlfriend. 
   I left 'K' our waitress a dime tip tacked on my bill with a note explaining why. If you are reading this, 'K', please understand that I normally would have left 20% minimum. In cash.  
  Oh yeah, the coffee was old and bitter too. I can at least relate to that."}
{"text":"I had two brunches in two days at the Breakfast Club, all during a three-day business trip to the Phoenix area last week.  I went on the advice of a woman working at the local PetSmart, where my dog was enjoying Doggy Daycamp, greatly appreciating the recommendation.

Both days I ordered a version of their Eggs Benedict.  The first day I ordered their Bello Bene, which is a superb marinated portabello mushroom with eggs,  hollandaise, and bordelaise sauce, which was the stuff of dreams.  The second day I had an excellent Benedict, aka \"Traditional Bene.\"  The iced lattes I ordered with the meals were also perfect.  The service, for the most part, was friendly and efficient.

If I lived in the area, I would gladly be a regular.  That's the single highest compliment I can pay any establishment."}
{"text":"Still fantastic!!! Have tried many breakfast places in the area, and this one still wins. We come here most weekends. My husband always gets the eggs Benedict, and he loves it! I either get the Bird omelet, or the BC Sandwich, both delicious. If I could make one suggestion, maybe the management will read this ;), please start offering Individual French press coffee, would make this a 6 star place!! See you next Saturday BClub!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go the last 3 mornings, the food was excellent and ready before the promise time.  I fresh cut turkey which was seared with mild spice along with scrambled egg whites, 2 slices of 9 grain toast with a light coating of butter, it also came along with O'Brien potatoes which were seared in the skillet and very fresh.  My selection also came with a side of fruit melons.  The to go packing is very upscale and sturdy!  The quality of the food was excellent, I will be returning to this place on. My next visit to the area.  The serving was huge, I saved the other portion for a late afternoon snack.  The parking is in the rear, street parking is very touch.  There is outdoor seating with comfy modern furniture.  The interior is very tastefully decorated and has an upscale appearance.  The staff is very efficient, courteous and fast moving."}
{"text":"This place is a great lil brunch spot. It's busy as per usual Scottsdale resteraunts, but had the ability to make a reservation via yelp... which is a win. We still had a wait upon our arrival, but it was worth it. We sat outside and watched all  the fancy cars drive around. Ordered a Tigers Milk it was strong... LOL this is a good thing FYI... and I think it was a caprese omlet... pesto, fresh miss, the tomatoes were amazing... yum"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale. They have amazing coffee, a must for breakfast! The service is really top notch. I have had an omelette, which was more than I could eat, eggs Benedict, that were outstanding. I've also had the basic 2 egg, toast, and bacon plate. Everything is cooked perfectly, and it comes out fast. The prices are honest and there are friendly folks if you want to chat at the counter. A great breakfast is a great start to the day, and they do it well."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. My boyfriend has been here before and decided to bring me. I had the egg white omelette with spinach and veggies, wedge potatoes and fresh fruit. I really liked that the omelette had some size to it. (I have found that sometimes restaurants skimp on the egg whites) I was able to replace the Swiss cheese  with cottage cheese  with no additional charge. The potatoes were nicely browned and were not greasy and the fruit was sweet and tasty. My boyfriend ordered a pancake and said it was the best he's had in quite a while. (Too bad they don't have a gluten free one)
I liked the atmosphere. They have a nice patio, which will be nice when it cools off. It is very clean and spacious. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. I'm sure I will return."}
{"text":"This was favorite place for breakfast in Scottsdale. The inside is airy and fun. The pancakes were delicious."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club was our \"go to\" place for breakfast/brunch.

We loved the tex-mex options as well as their \"platters\" with great portions on everything they serve.  We also appreciated being able to \"mix-and-match\" our meals with side orders of just about everything on the menu.  So, if you want a waffle with 2 fried eggs and some ham, you can do that; very nice!

Also quite convenient AND tasty was their offering of a bottle of reasonably good sparkling wine and a large carafe of freshly squeezed OJ.  You can then make your own Mimosa with as much (or as little) of both that you like!

We did take advantage of the Yelp waiting list feature that worked well for us.  I put my name into the queue and it told us the time by which we had to check in.  All three times we visited, we never waited longer than 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"First experience here was with my mother. Food was great our waitress was pleasant but I actually think we got more help from the buss boy who I ended up tipping.  So second time was with my fiance and after this experience I will not ever return first my fiance is weird and doesn't eat with metal utensils so we asked the hostess for plastic ones and she said she would return with some and never did. No big deal she is only a host.. anyway our waitress was awful.. tired, lazy and I had to ask her for a hot sauce like 5 times she never offered to refill my drink however anytime my fiance was running low she seemed to notice she had a horrible attitude towards us both, my guess she was hung over..  Still no excuse. Terrible terrible service from the waitresses however the buss boys do an amazing job with assisting customers and are most of the reason I returned a second time. However the waitresses ruined it and I'm never going back and wouldn't recommend it for someone who is actually looking to enjoy where they eat."}
{"text":"Very good good, loved the beet salad, so fresh and loaded with bursts of citrus. Loved the yogurt and berry plate."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places every time someone sets a morning meeting in downtown Scottsdale.  I typically order a veggie omelette or breakfast burrito and have never been let down.  The food is consistently good. the service is always exceptional and the staff is friendly - even after we have finished our meal, have had two more cups of coffee and have stayed 20 more minutes talking."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and trendy, but not unwelcoming. You can go enjoy breakfast with your kids.  
The coffee bar counter was full of people enjoying breakfast and drinks. Next time I want to try their dirty chai which is just chai with espresso. 
As for breakfast I ordered a breakfast burrito smothered with half chili Verde and half chorizo queso! Oh my yum! Next time I'm getting full smothered chorizo queso. It really made a normal breakfast burrito something special that you'd crave. The potatoes were really full of flavor, but a little greasy. The fruit on the side was actually good! It was the perfect ripeness which is unusual - usually it's more garnish for the plate.  My kids ordered pancakes (there is no kid's menu). Their pancakes and syrup were so tasty as well. I had more bites than I should have.  After breakfast came,  I decided to order a mocha. I was impressed worth how quickly it came out.  It is made with Ghirardelli according to their menu.  It was good!  Way better than the chalky mocha taste of starbucks!  
Overall a great experience!  The only downfall to this place is i think the wait can get pretty crazy,  but we got lucky today.  It's new years day and I think everyone is hung over and still in bed!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  Our aerver, Julia, was friendly and attentive, the menu offers a good selection, coffee is tasty and served piping hot, OJ is freshly squeezed, and our omelets were made perfectly!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge breakfast guy, so when I say this place is great, it must be.  If you can manage to get in without too much of a wait, you will most likely have an exceptional experience.  Great food, awesome vibrant servers, quick turnaround on orders and their Bloody Mary's are the bomb. On the way out the door, our server overheard us talking about hiking Camelback, so she brought us all complimentary bottled waters for the hike.  Great overall experience."}
{"text":"The name of this reminded me of the 80's but with all of the yoga attire being worn by the staff it is anything but. Very nice decor with an extremely friendly staff. They have a wide variety of choices from drink to food. We enjoyed a Mexican style breakfast that was very good without as long of a wait as expected. Everything tasted fresh and just the right portion. The fruit that came with each meal was very tasty and a pleasant way to end the meal."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with fantastic breakfast cuisine. My only complaint was the wait but that is to be expected on a weekend. Once we were seated, our server was prompt and the food was brought out very quickly. We had the pancakes and wild mushroom omelette (with avocado!) It was delicious, we will definitely return to The Breakfast Club!"}
{"text":"Very crowded on a Saturday morning, but we were seated relatively quickly.  The food was awesome and the staff attentive without being overbearing.  Much recommended."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and we have always had outstanding service.  In reading through a lot of mixed reviews I suspect our run of great luck has to do with we get here early and have not had the experience of waiting.  I can imagine if my husband had to wait 45 minutes for his first cup of their delicious coffee he would probably force me to take at least on star away. :)"}
{"text":"I love going out for breakfast, but there are a couple of reasons I won't go back here.  First of all, too expensive.  My girlfriend and I each had eggs benedict and coffees, and it was 40 bucks!  Second reason, the portions are huge.  I am always disappointed to see such huge portions coming out of a professional kitchen, because I realize how much food is headed toward the trash bin each day.  If you must serve such huge portions, please advise on the menu ahead of time.  

The most important reason I won't head back here...  unripened fruit as a garnish on my plate.  Just serve me what's in season please.  If it is in season, a tomato in summer for example, please make sure it's fresh, local, and ripe.  I was shocked when the waitress asked me if I wanted to add tomato to my dish and then she served me a hard, barely pink slice of tomato.  It's in season people!  Where did this tomato come from, South America?"}
{"text":"Huevos con masa.  That dish absolutely rocked.  The chiles, the cornbread, the queso sauce, now that was the way to start the day.  Great service, too."}
{"text":"Went here while staying in Scottsdale. Had the yogurt for breakfast. It was the best yogurt fruit and granola i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Love this place and every waitress who works here is gorgeous! (no homo).
Food was EXCELLENT!
Great for a first time experience.
Between here and the Good Egg...I am certainly returning.
Prices are right and the food is excellent! I had a seriously fresh ceasar salad and crispy sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here when I was visiting her in Phoenix because she knows I'm all about breakfast. 

This was a solid breakfast joint. I got a scramble and hash browns. The hashbrowns were overcooked on the outside and undercooked inside. The eggs were good.

Overall this was a decent place and I would gladly return."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, fantastic service , location can't be beat and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"If you go during the weekend, expect an hour wait.  You've got nothing to do so just sit in some of the lounge chairs out front and relax.  I had the turkey omelete with borsand cheese (on of my new favorite things), wife had the bagels with lox (capers, tomato, yadda yadda yadda) and my daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes.  We were all very satisfied with our meal, and from what I remember not that expensive. So whenever we're in the Scottsdale area and have some time to kill, we'll stop in for a great breakfast"}
{"text":"After a few days of drinking and being out in the heat, I needed something refreshing and healthy to get me back in sync. Fortunately, the Breakfast Club was just a few blocks down from our hotel. As soon as my friend and I arrived, we were seated right away on the patio. Service was prompt and friendly with none of the small chit chat. We were shocked at how cheap everything was.. breakfast entrees under $10 on vacation?? Unheard of unless you're eating at McDonalds or some other fast food place. I ended up ordering the egg white scramble with cottage cheese and fresh fruit and a glass of fresh carrot juice. I'm not a carrot juice fan but I thought what the heck let's try this. WOW! It was amazing! I didn't know carrot juice could taste so good and sweet by itself. I'm definitely hooked on carrot juice now! The food itself was really good. For the price, we were served pretty big portions and nothing tasted too oily or greasy to weigh me down. I especially liked the fruit selection which were slices of juicy watermelon, cantalope and pineapple - not the typical bowl of pathetic looking grapes and banana slices at other restaurants. I highly recommend the Breakfast Club to kick start your day in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Had brunch with my friend Adriane, an aspiring Olympian here this morning before I finally left Scottsdale, and it was pretty crowded.  Lots of trendy types in here that made me feel like I was eating somewhere in Vegas.  The omlette I had was tasty and filling and I couldn't even finish the potatoes or fruit, and since Adriane paid, the price was right!"}
{"text":"Hip and trendy it is, great food it is not. Coke in a bottle it has. No Diet Coke here despite the fact that in most of the country DC out sells Classic Coke. Ice tea instead?  Only if you like obnoxious flavorings. Menu description of French toast is enticing; delivery not so much.  What lands on your plate is a soggy mess with no toast attributes of any sort.  It's obvious that the cook has no idea of what French toast is supposed to be or how to prepare it. I'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day.  Suggest they visit the Landmark in the Time Warner building in NYC to have the best."}
{"text":"This was my second trip here and both times I've been pleased but not overly impressed. The food is good, the service is good, the selection is good; I'd sum up that in general, it was 'good'. Not great, not amazing, not knock my socks off, but definitely 'I'll come back here again for breakfast'. Maybe I need to branch out of my comfort zone and try something different there, but honestly I'm a big fan of eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns. In that spirit I ordered the Quick Start Breakfast and everything came out as I'd ordered it, the Orange Marmalade was very good (if a little too sweet rather than fragrant) and the iced green tea is a very refreshing option especially here in the desert. It's a cute (if basic) atmosphere and I really like how they put alot of their menu up on the chalkboard above the coffee bar, it looks very hip and colorful. I definitely wouldn't sit and wait if there was a wait, when we came it was 9ish on a Monday so it was pretty easy to get a table."}
{"text":"Have been in Arizona for a day and have probably heard of this place 10 times already. So worth coming because the food was amazing. And so was the coffee & I can be pretty picky with that. Sat at the bar and still had great service. Jamie was our server, she was very sweet & attentive. If I'm ever in Arizona again I will 100% be coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here and the company I had with me but the service was horrible. We went in we were just greeted by a rude hostess who told us it would be a 20 minute wait. We then needed up waiting less than 5 minutes. We were sat and the waitress could not have been more unhappy. 

She was complaining when we asked her for mugs for our coffee because we thought we were waiting 20 minutes so we all had to go cups from their cafe. She dropped the money on the floor without noticing and when we brought it to her attention she didn't even say a word or even look at us for that matter. She never came for refills such an ugly experience at such a nice restaurant! 

The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary! I ordered a wrap which was tasty but the turkey was just piled in there so it was a little much but the food wasn't anything to complain about!"}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago my husband and I stopped here for breakfast around 12:30 p.m on a Sunday. They were very busy, but the hosts took our name promptly and in a friendly way let us know that it could be 45 minutes to an hour. We were sat at a table in approximately 35 minutes and greeted quickly. Our waitress was nice and the food arrived in a timely manner. I had the biscuits and gravy and my husband had a caprese salad. Both were absolutely fantastic. The food was fresh, served at appropriate temperatures and seasoned perfectly. Now I understand why they are so busy! The prices are very reasonable as well. This place is a treasure among the Old Town bar scene and we will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a bloody mary as well as eggs benedict... the food was great and very filling! Everyone in my party was happy with their food. The only complaint I have was that there was some sort of faulty equipment on the ceiling that dumped water on a couple girls at our table, one got it so bad she was drenched. Eventually our table was moved, but it took a while."}
{"text":"We were in need of breakfast/brunch and how can you go wrong with place call Breakfast Club?!

There was a ten-minute wait on a Friday mid-morning but well worth it. 
I am very particular about my over medium eggs and they nailed it! Whites fully cooked with the runny yolk. Thank you thank you thank you!

Good food and good service."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Scottsdale!! Just make sure you get there early because there is typically a wait. Servers are amazing and food is delicious! Can't beat the price and the food and beverage selection! Def recommend everyone to eat here. I always order the juevos rancheros because it's the bomb!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Seating took a bit but we held out even though there seemed to be a lot of open seats.  Food wasn't that impressive.  We both had the eggs benedict.  It wasn't awful -- but wasn't stunning either.  It was close to our hotel so it was a good location -- I'd probably give it another shot but would try something else."}
{"text":"I have been to break club a couple times.  Decent time each visit.... but on my last visit I noticed something.  I think that the staff are aliens.  I noticed that one was speaking to another in like a robot language.  Then I saw one of the staff use a laser to make my toast.  The whole experience was bizarre.  Nobody said good bye but I felt like they were in my head talking to me.  Must have been telepathy!  Breakfast was ok but the alien experience was great.  Maybe they have some dishes from their home planet that they would like to share with us earthlings.  Like moons over my home planet."}
{"text":"Terrible food. This is for college kids with amatuer palates and amatuer hangovers. And, I suspect, illegal hiring practices. The waitresses are all conspicuously pretty."}
{"text":"The food is good but kinda reluctant to go back because I was sitting at the bar and the waitresses (3 of them)were over on one side of the bar constantly staring at me/watching me eat my food. I felt like saying \"do you want to eat it for me and walking out. I consider their actions childish and bad for business ."}
{"text":"The food was good, the location and view from outside was great.  The price could have been a bit less, but I guess that's what the kids pay for brunch these days.  I had the huevos rancheros, which, of course I did because I always do.  The crispy tortilla was a good touch--though it got to be a bit much after all of the liquids from the beans, salsa, egg, etc. all soaked in.  I would've opted for refried beans instead of the (somewhat watery) black beans and could have done with some spicier or more flavorful salsa (spicy tomatillo salsa is my personal favorite), but all in all, it was a nice time out with my lady.  The kombucha was a good option and was as pricey as you'd expect for such trendy things."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place; best pancakes and pineapple juice in old town! The service was good, and you can reserve a table 20 minutes out, which you will need to because it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Ok food, found a hair on my honey dew melon slice, disgusting. 
$4.50 for a glass of cranberry juice. Nothing spectacular. Rather try something else."}
{"text":"Really great place for brunch!  Huge breakfast menu!  My only complaint is that they say they have \"black iced tea\" but it's really some passionfruit or peach black tea.  Otherwise a winner.  Be prepared to wait if you arrive after 10AM!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I Iove trying new places. Got to try the Breakfast Club today and I wonder why this place gets so busy. We got there at about 8:15am on a Sunday, immediately seated. I forgot to say iced on my dirty chai and told my server before I got my drink. She said they would remake it although I just asked for a glass of ice. The drinks were the best part, I got the Turkey Benedict my husband got their eyes, bacon and toast. Most of their breakfasts are made with 4 eggs which is a lot in my opinion. My poached eggs were rubbery and my husbands over medium eggs were runny. Cost wise, I struggle with paying $11 for a basic Benedict and most items were over $10. Last week we did brunch right across the street at the Montauk. I recommend going there, their steak and egg sandwich was really good and big enough to share. We will stop into the BC for coffee drinks if we are in the area but I don't see myself making the trip over to Scottsdale for BC. I gave three stars for our service, the drinks and how my server handled my hot versus iced coffee situation. Also I am a yogi and I wear yoga pants all the time, but not sure about them being used as a uniform. Again just my opinion."}
{"text":"My wife & I came here based upon a recommendation from a friend. I ordered the biscuits & gravy and my wife ordered the regular French toast. The flavors from the jalapeño cheddar biscuit with gravy were incredible. My wife said the French toast was excellent but that the side of bacon she ordered was the best she's ever had. Her exact words were: \"I would've traded the 3rd piece of my French toast for another piece of bacon.\" Highly recommend grabbing breakfast here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Phoenician Resort and we were not turned on by the menu they offered. My sister in-law recommended The Breakfast Club do we drove a couple miles down the road and got a delicious breakfast.  My  wife got the \"Foster: Topped with Bananas Foster & Vanilla Ice Cream\" and she thought it was really good. I got the \"Huevos Con Masa w/ Chipotle Cornbread, Chorizo Queso & Pico de Gallo\" and that was really out of this world. I never had anything like this before and i commend them for how unique the dish was. This place is better than Ihop (which is 2 stars in my book) and probably cheaper. I would come here again and again."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just A-OK. I appreciate it being a place definitely for the locals and the staff was super friendly and attentive.

The things I really enjoyed were the french toast (challah bread) and the fruit bowl (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pineapple, and a few others). The things that left me wanting more were the turkey sausage, pancakes, and omelettes. I just felt meh about it.. but the french toast was amazing. One of my dining mates had the \"special\" which was french toast covered in fruit. I'd totally go back for that.

It's a cute restaurant with true brunch/breakfast hours and outdoor seating. Great for people watching!"}
{"text":"After deciding that we really just wanted some breakfast at 12pm, we stopped in here on our way to do some shopping at the Fashion Mall around the corner. The place seemed relatively busy which I think is always a good sign. 

We were seated promptly and our server was at our table shortly after that. We sat outside along Scottsdale Road. It was pretty loud, but it was also great to people watch! I couldn't believe how quickly our food came out! And it was really delicious! 

I had the Bird Omelette, which had avocado, turkey, Boursin cheese and mushrooms stuffed inside. My meal also came with pan fried potatoes and huge, fresh hunks of fruit. I couldn't finish, so I saved the fruit and potatoes for later. My Mom ordered a traditional breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, potatoes and fruit. It was also massive and she said it was very good. 

Our server was excellent. She was friendly, prompt and professional. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to people watch and not looking to pay astronomical prices for breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A pleasure... wait staff was very pleasant, the food was absolutely delicious, quality of the food was exceptional. People watching always fun in downtown Scottsdale. Definitely recommend this as a fun little spot for a breakfast respite"}
{"text":"The place to be if you are in your 20's and continuing your all nighter from the previous evening.  Extremely loud and energetic but not if you are looking for a more intimate relaxing breakfast.  First, the positive aspects of our visit was the service at our table.  The waitress attentive and friendly and provided quick service.    Our fresh squeezed juice was excellent, my 7 year old, who is an expert on pancakes, said that they were too gummy and did not taste good.  They remained uneaten on her plate.  My 12 year old's omelet was runny and had to be sent back to the kitchen for further cooking.   The counter service where we ordered smoothies before being seated at our table was the worst I have seen in years.  The girl handling the walk up/carry out counter continually took phone orders and ignored the line waiting patiently.  When I pointed this out I was shushed and received a \"talk to the hand\".  Extremely rude.  This girl should not be in the customer service industry and has lot to learn.  Not sure why she is in this role when she obviously does not enjoy what she is doing.   We will not be back.  Plenty of other excellent breakfast places in the Phoenix area with friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you're an omelet lover like me, order THE BIRD!!!! I swear they use 6 eggs because it is SO large! This fluffy egg goodness is jam packed with turkey, avocado, mushrooms & Boursin cheese {this is the secret that makes it perfect}. Their Potatoes O'Brien will rock your socks! For beverages, the BC Iced Coffee is a must; their secret concoction of sweetness will send your tastebuds wild and give you the best energy buzz to kick off your day! {Both locations //Old Town Scottsdale & CityScape// are wonderful!} This is my favorite place to bring out of town guests for breakfast when they're visiting. Don't be surprised if your massive breakfast from BC fills you up until dinner time!"}
{"text":"This place is probably crowded all the time. Went here on a Monday morning and the line was insane. Good thing we decided to wait it out because BC is delicious. I wasn't too hungry so I just went with your standard 2 eggs and bacon. Let me tell you something: their bacon is out of control good, and I'm not a huge bacon guy. Fresh fruit was also delicious. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Yes!  One of the best breakfast/brunch places in old town Scottsdale.  This is saying a lot considering every block has a breakfast restaurant to choose from.  I am an eggs Benedict connoisseur/foodie and have to say this is the best in town by far.  There is not one item on there menu that you can go wrong with if you are trying to tame that morning hangover.  This goes very well with the best Bloody Mary's in town, Spicy!  

Staff is very attentive and never makes you wait for something you need.  If something is out of your liking, they will correct it in a heart beat.

Expect a wait if you are here during snowbird season and spring training.  Otherwise, come in around noon or early in the morning and you will be treated to a great food experience."}
{"text":"Nice place, but trendy in Old Scottsdale.  This is a place for the college students of Phoenix from ASU, Tempe, etc.  This is a place to see and be seen.  Many races are in here, but mostly your young frat or sorority friends.  I personally thought it was fun, but I can see families get a little bewildered by the place.  If you are a middle aged person who has a family, skip this place even though the food is good.  OR better yet, come in the late afternoon when the college kids are out and partying so you can avoid them."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Server seemed like she hated her life :( but the food and the atmosphere were great. We got the french toast, biscuits and gravy and the mexican bowl. All tasted great!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I had the Applewood bacon, scrambled eggs, and regular French Toast. The bacon was nice and crisp with no undercooked spots. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the added just the right amount of cheese to them. Lastly, the French Toast...DAMN! It was so good! I definitely recommend people to try this place! 

The decor is nice and the waitresses wear all black shirts with black tights. Women won't get anything from this portion of my review, but they had some very nice looking waitresses in those outfits! Lol!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I had the pesto buffalo omelet just was so good and tried the southwest bowl. Everything was great with this place"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning so naturally it was quite busy. We really expected great things considering how long of a wait there was (tip: call ahead and they'll put you on the list). I found the hostess and our waitress to clearly be stressed and it came across as very unfriendly and borderline rude. When seated, our waitress forgot our drink order 15 minutes after taking it and had to come back to ask what it was. We ordered two coffees and an OJ. Not complicated. The coffee was some of the worst I've ever had. Either it was badly burned or just very cheap. The food was pretty bland...I'd call it okay at best. After the food came out, our waitress never asked how it was, if we wanted anything else or brought water refills despite empty glasses for all of us. This was our first and last time at this very disappointing facility."}
{"text":"I have been to this fantastic place numerous times for breakfast. The food is always great and the employees are wonderfully talented! Call ahead to get on the waiting list so you won't have too wait long. The French toast is awesome."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We went today around 10 a.m. this morning. We were quoted 40 minutes and waited about that. Prepare to wait because this place is always packed. I was really impressed by the service. The hostesses knew what every single person on their extremely long list looked like. There was no annoying, loud screaming of names or stupid buzzer things. They personally walked up to each person to take them to their seats. It was refreshing. The tables turned really quickly and were promptly cleaned and re-sat within minutes. The service inside was just as good. We were greeted right away and ordered. The food didn't take forever and was DELICIOUS. I can honestly say it was the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The portions were huge for the price. Our coffees and waters will filled before they were even close to being empty. The place runs like a well-oiled machine. Its no surprise they are always as busy as they are. I plan on talking my family here when they come out for spring training. If you are coming from out of town I highly recommend you check it out.

Oh and bonus points for the large television playing the Syracuse game."}
{"text":"I cant believe the ratings on this place.   Something is wrong...  Its a 5 star all the way.   Try some Eggs.   Best looking wait staff in AZ."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the breakfast club! The food was delicious and the place was gorgeous."}
{"text":"Here's a GREAT choice...$17 buys anything on the menu (tip included). Sample the blueberry pancakes with a hearty side of their bone-in ham steak, bottomless cup of coffee & you're set for the day. Service is ALWAYS prompt & courteous. Conveniently located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've eaten here around 6 or 7 times over the past few years. Sometimes it was during the week, sometimes on the weekends. If you're going to go there on the weekends, please get there as early as possible otherwise you will be waiting for an hour. This is not a reflection of how poor the service is, it is a reflection of how good the food is. It is well prepared, uses high grade ingredients, and always made to order. 

It is not like going to Denny's as I have read on other reviews here. As far as the service goes, the staff that work there work their asses off. I have yet to see any of the workers milling around or chatting with their coworkers. Yes you will pay a little more, but it worth it. Take away: if you plan ahead and leave your childish pretensions about what good service is at home, you will have an excellent breakfast!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here I have gotten the same server and she completely ruined my liking for the breakfast club. Each time we have waited very long to be greeted. For my first experience with this server, I had to go to the host stand after at least 10 minutes of not being greeted. My brother's drink went empty multiple times, my dad's food came out wrong and we barely saw our server and when we did she did not seem like she wanted be to there. we we're dining here for my dad's birthday & it really dampers a celebration to get completely awful service. I was hoping this girl was just having an off day but the next time I came to BC I sat in her section again and we received the same awful service. Not only does she walk around with RBF but she didn't seem to care about our needs. She barely stopped by and seemed to avoid us - but is smiling when talking to other employees. The reputation built by the food & nice hostesses are ruined by the attitude of this server. I will not bring my service this location ever again!"}
{"text":"So this review is mainly for the hostesses then I will get to the food. We were quoted for a 45 minute wait. So around TO BE EXACT from the hostesses 42 minutes, my boyfriend went up to ask where we were on the list and in a sassy rude way she said \"we quoted you for 45 minutes-1 hour and its been 42 minutes\" like okay. I remember putting my name in and getting quoted 45 minutes, but thats besides the point. I was a hostess back in the day and even when customers came in before their time there is no reason to be rude or snarky. There was like a whole squad of them there just with bad attitudes. After she gave that sass to my boyfriend about how much EXACTLY we were waiting for she told him \"why don't you go enjoy the sun some more\" like WHAT why is that okay to say to someone in such a rude manner? I don't know what their issues were. But the hostesses need an attitude adjustment and to learn to put on a smile and ignore it which is WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!!!!!

The food was really good though. The food was huge portions but so yummy. Bloody Marys were good and spicy and our server was really nice and filled waters very quicky. And this smaller blonde lady with a southern accent was super sweet as well.

My boyfriend got the hog omelette and I got a the eggs bene and both were wonderful. I also really liked how they give you a fruit stick along with the potatoes.

I would've given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the young hostesses who act like they are snobby b****es who apparently don't know how to put on a fake face because it's their first job."}
{"text":"Awesome Eggs Benedict..I recommend highly. The service was quick and polite for a very busy day.  The coffee is top notch.  Fruit with the eggs was fresh and cool. Don't leave Scottsdale without having breakfast here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best mimosas & delicious food! Great service every time we've been here! Wish we had one in Dallas!!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Scottsdale, we walked over to the Breakfast Club every morning for breakfast. I would dare to say that you would have a tough time finding something not to like here. 

I tried something different every day and was never disappointed. By far the most impressive item was the jalapeno biscuits and gravy with fontina cheese. We got an order for the table to share, and they didn't last long! 

There is typically quite a wait at the door, and they don't serve alcohol, so don't count on bloody's or mimosas. Don't let that discourage you, though. The Breakfast Club is worth the wait, and sobriety."}
{"text":"The breakfast bowl was an amazing blend of breakfast foods paired with a sensuous green chili pulled pork.  Flavors blend well while the crisp hash-browns buried below provide just the right texture...bloody Mary was so so... Highly recommend stopping by for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/ lunch spot. We knew this place was busy so we called ahead and they put us on a wait list via text message. By the time we arrived, our text came in and our table was ready. They had a nice selection of food, a relaxed attractive environment with a pretty diverse crowd for Scottsdale. Service was nice, it was pretty fast, food was good. They make substitutions and even have almond milk and other dietary substitutes that many people like myself find necessary. Hope our next visits are as good as the last two visits."}
{"text":"Really great fresh squeezed juice and smoothies to start. I had the border bowl which was one of the best meals I've had for breakfast! My boyfriend got their French toast which looked great as well!! Great open ambiance, with outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  The service was snotty.  My brother-in -law didn't  get his rye toast and realized when the check came. It was brought up to the waitress and she did not handle it well. Said she could bring him toast now.  When we were all done eating?! He declined and she did nothing else to comp for it. The wait was normal for a popular breakfast spot. Sent back our bloody Mary's because they were watery and bland. Got a screwdriver instead but it was still too watery.  My sister got a greyhound and it was a little better but still somewhat watery. My daughter loved her chocolate chip pancakes. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We went to The Breakfast Club on a friend's recommendation, and an internet recommendation.  Right off the bat, I was bothered by two things:  first, my knife had some caked-on gunk on it, and second, our waitress brought us each water with lemon.  I suppose most people would not be bothered by that, but I have an aversion, and likely an allergy, to citrus.  I always ask for my water or iced tea without lemon.  I ordered bacon and eggs, over medium.  My daughter ordered ham and eggs, over medium.  Both her eggs and mine were overdone (brown & crispy) on the outside, runny on the inside.  Neither of us liked the fact that the fruit was on the same plate, because the egg yolks (and undercooked whites) ran into the fruit.  Up until we ate here, I never imagined that anybody could mess up breakfast.  Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed with The Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"Welcoming and friendly service is probably part of the reason this place is highly rated!

Amazing portions and taste! Glad we stopped in for breakfast! 

Orders:
-White chocolate mocha latte has a unique flavor.  Salmon lox bene is filling. Salmon fresh. Fresh fruit and soft to cut through. -French toast in slices for the kids. Super fluffy. For the light stomach- order in slices or get the full order. 
-Lean & green omelette with goat cheese.

Full coffee bar! They offer all the speciality drinks!"}
{"text":"We go here for the breakfast/ brunch. Everything taste good and there Mimosas are off the chain!! Yummy.. Bacon is really good. They give large amounts of food, u never leave hungry ur pretty much set for the day. I like both locations Scottsdale and downtown. The only thing is wait!! It Can be like an hour long but it pretty worth it at both locations. If u want a great breakfast and nice drinks go here. Love this place."}
{"text":"Nice menu with old standbys (pancakes, egss, bacon etc.) and some interesting items as well - eggs with chorizo sauce over cornbread, huevos rancheros with green chili pork topping in a bowl over lettuce and a small amount of beans and cheese, eggs benedict with salmon.

Lox and bagel plate for $13 could have used a bit more salmon for the price. 

Jalapeno cheddar biscuit with pork gravy was mediocre.

Service is quite, quite fast so tables turn quickly."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going here for years now. They changed the interior which is more inviting and open. The bar makes it a great place to watch tv and the outside patio is looking into old town. Very bright and welcoming hosts I recommend this for your breakfast place to go."}
{"text":"Omg! By far my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale! I'm here on vacation and they have the best food! 

Wait was long and we had a big party but the staff was very good about keeping us updated on our table and timing and when people are leaving. 

Service was incredible! Our server was so nice, informative, helpful and fast! 8 of us got in an out in a little over and hour! 

Food was delicious! I made a create your own breakfast burrito and it came with potatoes and fruit. Perfect size and portion. 

I would come here every time I visit!!!"}
{"text":"Innovative dishes attractively presented. Good service despite the crowds. Always eat here when in town. Well worth the usual wait."}
{"text":"Service was not great.  They had several tables available, but still would not let me sit until my friend arrived.  (she was on her way).  There were 4 people standing at the check in counter (not sure why they needed so many people up there since they were not doing anything but playing on their cell phones and chatting with each other).  When she did arrive and we had put in our reservation, we were told we would still have to wait.  Again, there was table available and I had been there for 15 minutes.  Other people came in and got seated immediately without waiting.  We ended up at the counter and was told they did not have any soda except bottled regular coke.  I ended up with water (I don't drink coffee and there were no other decent options).  The server took her time getting to us and I had to ask twice for water.    The food portion came out a little too quickly (about 2 minutes). This made me wonder if it was pre-made rather than fresh.  The order had to be cooked and there was no way it could have been fresh.  It was not very hot which also made me question whether or not it was pre-made.  Overall, I have had much better service and food.  Considering we were at the counter, it took forever to get the bill and the never received any refills on the water.  I would not go back again.  Very dissappointed."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for breakfast.  I must say that I was never disappointed.  I really like their eggs Benedict and their jalapeno biscuits and gravy.  Their coffee was great too.  Today I came for lunch with some co-workers and had the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was very good with fontina and cheddar cheeses between to thick pieces of sourdough bread.  The tomato soup I could tell was homemade, but it was lacking in something for me... I think it needed to be a little thicker maybe with some croutons or something."}
{"text":"UPDATE!!
I bumped up their review from 3 starts to 4! Their message to me after leaving this review was so professional I feel they deserve a second chance. A well run business means a LOT especially when they listen. Looking forward to the WI-FI...  I'll be back!

Here is the old review...

I like everything but the potatoes and soggy veggies they call O'brien potatoes. Omelet was really good and the bread is fresh. Service is too lax but more importantly for one who works at these kind of stops NO WIFI !"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated, was given water and never saw our server again. We sat for over 20 minutes hoping we would be waited on. I told the hostess that had seated us that we were never waited on. Her only reply was \"did I seat you?\" The people who were seated long after we were were waited on"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!

Place is clean, friendly staff, food is great also. Parking however may be a small problem. Ordered the bird omelette and it was great! Large portions. Friend had the huevos rancheros and was not as thrilled with is."}
{"text":"If you are one of those people that says, \"I could eat breakfast for every meal\", then you cannot miss this place in Scottsdale... coffee, eggs, french toast, and their bacon.. all amazing... so get their early and try to remember why in the world you would do the things you did last night... if you dont remember, order another coffee... its good."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, 2 of which were terrible, but recently it has been better.  The first 2 times I had really poor service and one time I found a hair in my food.  The other times I went with a group so it wasn't my choice, but surprisingly the service was better and the food was good.  Seems like it's always super busy on the weekends, but I don't think it's worth a wait."}
{"text":"The food is great however just like the other Breakfast Club location in downtown Phoenix, the service was so-so. I would recommend anyone to go here but anticipate at least a 20 minute wait at this location on the weekends."}
{"text":"I thought this place was OK I have heard a lot of great reviews from this place from friends but I got the biscuits and gravy he and was actually a bit disappointed my dad really enjoyed his meal which was just regular bacon and eggs"}
{"text":"If you come on the weekend, you might accidentally think that you've stepped into Scottsdale Urgent Care with all the hip 20 somethings recovering from the previous night's rage at Axis Radius. 

This place is busy, be prepared to wait 30 minutes if you want breakfast on the weekend. And when it's busy, be prepared to not find your waiter/waitress. They'll be running around and then you'll have to waive them down without making yourself look like a pretentious beezy. REFILL MY WATER.

I had the Wild Mushroom omlette which was made with something called fontina cheese. I love mushrooms and when I got my omelette there were plenty of mushrooms in this entree to make me happy. Simple omlette with plenty of mushrooms but not a whole lot of taste - I really was expecting more. I think this place may be a tad overpriced, but the portions are pretty large - so that may be the reason. 

The girlfriend had Huevos Rancheros because she was in the mood for green chile and she said she loved it. It hit her spot like I never have and she was pleasantly full afterwards. However, I have recently found out that they serve pork green chile and that detail was not specifically on the menu when she ordered - so if you don't eat pork or have any dietary restrictions just be made aware of that. 

I didn't leave this place saying, \"omg, i have to come back\" or even saying, \"their food was really good.\" It was an average food experience in a Scottsdale breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Terrible made the mistake of telling them I'm waiting for a friend.. They refused to seat me at a booth or table although they had 75%!of them open.. and pointed the bar area! This was highly unprofessional, needless to say they lost their tip! I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Delicious food with comfortable outside patio for sitting. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is located in OLD Scottsdale and was so convenient to our hotel. It's packed so be patient. I sat at the counter. The menu is somewhat limited but it's all good. Portions are just right.  The staff is young and energetic. Very helpful with pointing out where other things to do were so early in the morning. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and would say this is the place to go if your location is old town Scottdale. Very nice, open, bright ambiance with plenty of counter space for lone diners. The selection of food is varied, to include low carb/high protein dishes. The staff is attentive, prompt and friendly. The only reasons I did not give five stars is that the music is too loud and the table coffee is sub par, very similar to hotel room packet coffee."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, thought it was going to be a treat since there were all these people waiting out front and there was a 20 min wait for a table inside.  I ordered the wild mushroom omelet and my friend ordered the blt with cottage cheese since they didn't serve sweet potato fries yet apparently.  (I wasn't too impressed with the menu selections either btw, there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch, but i guess it is BREAKFAST club)
The omelet wasn't very good - I'm not sure if it was because I should've ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out.  No amount of ketchup, salsa, Tabasco or Patio could salvage it.  My friend was nice enough to trade with me halfway through and the BLT was ok, but I gotta say this even though it feels wrong - there is too much bacon.  There would be a pile of 5 strips of thick sliced bacon in each bite and whereas I do love bacon, it was a bit overpowering.  Not to mention, between each slice was a thick layer of grease which made me wonder if they cooked it in layers in the oven???  Anyways, after I pulled out all but 2 layers the balance seemed restored AND my friend got some meat for the omelet.  

All in all - the service was great, the hash browns were good and I loved the strips of red and yellow peppers in it, but did not like the menu selections which were pretty limited and the entrees.  The omelet had more cheese than egg, and the BLT had more bacon than LT and bread combined."}
{"text":"Visiting from Nebraska !!! OMG why can't they have this place there?! Food is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I have ever had! The only downside is the wait to be seated. Don't let the wait scare you though. The food is well worth the wait! I've only been here once, but it will definitely not be my last!"}
{"text":"Good food, nothing crazy. Just you standard breakfast/lunch menu. Service staff is nice but super slow on the weekends.  Best thing I've had was the breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"As a guy who has spent many a day hunched over a metal bowl with a heat gun roasting his own coffee beans like a heroin addict cooking smack, I am not typically over enthusiastic about a restaurant's coffee.  Breakfast club is doing their java right, and they even have a separate coffee bar, which is nice given how long you typically have to wait for a table.  

Sadly their food is really average. It's better than a chain restaurant, but not by much. All in all an OK meal. I suppose my expectations were a little high given how much my friends overhyped the place.  I'll be back for the coffee bar, but won't stay for the food.  

As a warning to others, the infamous Scottsdale doucher community is out in full here. Lot's of comically large fake tits on 115 pound women, popped collars, and Ed Hardy shirts.  If you are a douche who likes so-so food, you'll love being seen at breakfast club, otherwise head over to somewhere that is actually cool like Over Easy or La Grande Orange."}
{"text":"Love it here, after their big remodel the wait isn't as long. The eggs are always fluffy, the side of fruit always good. Coffee is dark/bold and always fresh. The fried potatoes are delish and if you are in the mood for comfort food classic, my fave grilled cheese and tomato soup is right here, and I don't even like tomato soup!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast club! I've been coming here since 2009 for the consistently \"Scottsdale\" vibe. All the hosts and servers are sweet and pleasant. 

I'm not much of a breakfast person or breakfast out but I know if I bring someone here they'll like it. 

Food was good. Latte with extra hot coconut milk took a long time. Server apologized before I asked about it and got it removed from the bill without me asking. Much appreciated. 

They're very accommodating with special requests too. 

I'm giving them a 4 rather than a 5 because I think the plates could use a garnish. Also, back in the day, before they remodeled, there was a homier feel to the place, but it still felt cool. It's a little more upscale now. If I do go out for breakfast I prefer a smaller, cozier environment...but if you go, I know you'll like it."}
{"text":"Alright, I don't get the poor reviews.  Most of the complaints seem to be focused on the wait time.  I understand thru-put for a restaurant.  But wait times are what they are when you want to eat a popular spot.  Today was awesome, showed up and there was a line, asked what the wait was: seated immediately outside.

Haley, our waitress, was on it today.  I've sat on the patio every time and service is either good, or in today's case awesome.  We ordered the quick start, which is the simplest thing on the menu, but I did not figure it would come out as if I had snapped my fingers.  Haley brought our plates steaming from the kitchen what felt not five minutes after putting in the ticket.  She then gave us coffees to go."}
{"text":"I loved the breakfast bowl, it was awesome. The service was great and fast. The patio seating was pretty nice too."}
{"text":"WOW!  WOW!  WOW!  Why have we not been to this place before?  Everything and I mean everything we had was amazing. The service was quick and personal. I am a huge eggs Benedict fan and their's is the best I have ever had, hands down!  Bloody Mary's yum!  Hubby had the cornbread rancheros and didn't talk the until they were gone. So they must have been good!  Can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to thank all my friends at Breakfast Club for comping our meal today on our anniversary. 
Amazing what great service everyone was getting during the morning before the Super Bowl. It was swamped and handled with aplomb.  Food was excellent as always."}
{"text":"As a caution, this restaurant can be extremely busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. In part, it's due to the delicious food and convenient old town location. I'm an early bird, so popping in when they open at 6am is not uncommon. Order what you like as the most items on the menu are delicious. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love it. Attractive place with good food at fair prices. Went there more than once when we were in town."}
{"text":"my husband and i were in scottsdale around 12:30pm and decided to try Breakfast Club...he for lunch and i for breakfast, which is served all day.
he ordered the BC dip, which arrived piping hot with yummy au jus and horseradish mayo on the side.  he sub'd fresh berries for potatoes and his order was executed perfectly.  i had the blueberry pancakes, no compote and again, my order, although the pancakes looked a bit pale, were cooked thru completely and delivered exactly as ordered: no strange powdered sugar or butter anywhere near the plate.  our server was terrific with iced tea and water refills and offered me an iced tea to go, which was great.  service was not rushed and the wait time was minimal (10 min.). the app to notify us how many parties were ahead of us worked great.  we will be back to try out BC again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning for eggs Benedict. Best I've had. Everything about my experience was excellent. Service food quality were all without complaint."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! Everything I have ordered was great! Love the waffles and fruit. Coffee is great, and there are fresh squeezed juices to go with your meal."}
{"text":"Odd place.  The employees are clearly disgruntled,  beginning with the hostess; and thats not a generalization. Its obvious that the mood is dismal and that is reflected in the food; quality and presentation.  Absolutely not worth the wait.  There are lots of wonderful options within a couple of blocks .... Do yourself a favor and pass the Breakfast Club by."}
{"text":"LOVE The Breakfast Club!  I must admit that my whole life was spent going to greasy spoon restaurants for breakfast...  Until I met a friend who is an interior designer.  She suggested that I get away from my backwoods grass roots and go to brunch somewhere that has \"real\" food.  

The only reasons why it got 4 instead of 5 stars: Going to The Breakfast Club for Saturday brunch is not a good idea when you are starving.  Chances are you will have about a 30+ minute wait, but the wait is well worth it.  Also, you can't sit on the patio and drink alcohol.  Which really sucked when after a 45 minute wait we were seated, handed our menu's, got comfortable, and then were told that we had to move inside if we were going to drink mimosas.  This was the only bad experience in the 10+ times we have been there since.

Good:  When we walked into The Breakfast Club, I could see why my interior designer friend loves this place.  Simplistic design keeps it clean and feeling uncrowded, even when every seat in the house is full (and this place can hold a LOT of people for its size.)  The food is amazing, and although I have tasted other items on the menu I order the biscuits and gravy and a mimosa or two every time we go.  The staff is cute, friendly and attentive and everything is a decent price."}
{"text":"The following of this place kills me... Im from northern California where this place would be average.. but in Scottsdale.. its considered the bomb! OKAY.. some things I LOVE.. such as the eggs benedict.. its worth the splurge..but I get the hollandaise sauce (with a hint of chipolte in the mix) on the side... The coffee is strong and I love it! They carry the sugar in the raw, 'stevia'.. that rates high with me, even though somewhere in Cali that would not be a special thing..but I love the small things when I get them in AZ. Ive had their huevos rancheros.. wont do that again.. its not like any Ive had before.. so give the chef a 'A' for going the creative way on the rancheros! BUT after a nite at the W.. it made me feel not great.. its overpowered in sauce... and the tortilla covering the bowl was weird to me.. too much. 
BUT again, I give it 3 stars bc for here its a great place to grab any kind of breakfast you want.. Challah french toast, pancakes, coffee bar.. and still watch the cutesy Scottsdale---ites.. weekends plan to wait!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast food, but good flavors, except for the orange juice--too sour. Stuffy service. Hard to find parking. Long wait, even out of season. But a good spot to enjoy for an early morning bite."}
{"text":"Server was unfriendly and just plain rude. My salmon Benedict was okay but nothing special. Only plus was the iced coffee is a lot of bang for your buck. The large is LARGE. We will go to one of the many other breakfast places next time."}
{"text":"I admit that this was actually our second choice.  we were originally supposed to go to Matt's big breakfast, but it's closed on mondays!  really!  who closes their breakfast joint on Monday?  I mean you're only open from 6.30 am to 2.30 pm, but i guess they may have been hungover from the Cardinals' win over the Eagles.

Anyhow, back to the food.  There was a fairly long wait ~30 minutes and were we seated outside (right along scottdale ave), but it was actually worth it.  my food was ok.  I ordered the bacon and eggs and the oatmeal.  you can't really mess up bacon and eggs, but for some reason, the oatmeal was really good.  my oatmeal that i put in the microwave doesn't taste like that!  

but the real highlight was what my fiancee ordered.  she had the cinnamon french toast with toasted nuts and berries.  4 nice slices of heaven with some fresh berries and toasted almonds and pecans.  

I can forgive Matt's big breakfast this time, but if i'm ever back in the Phoenix area, they better be open and beat the french toast at the breakfast club."}
{"text":"Came here while I was visiting my younger brother and before we had to drive back home. This place is very good and was very busy for a week day and being about 10 am. Just a heads up, come a little early due to the parking being very tough to find.  Ended up getting egg Benedict and pancakes which was very yummy! We didn't have any food left at the end of the meal. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down. BEST BREAKFAST IN THE CITY!!  

Pros:
* The atomosphere is really chic yet still feels comfortable.
* The service is fast!
* The food is the best part... the buttermilk pancakes AHhhhmazing.  The \"bird\" omelete is to die for.  Topped with creme frache and loaded down with turkey, cheese and avocado... I have been dreaming about it!!
* You will leave full.

I wish they would franchise and put a BC in St. Louis (where I live).  I would be there every weekend!"}
{"text":"I'm not going back. Nor would I recommend it. They were under construction when we went but they had a small area for people to eat. No reason to wait that's for sure. My wife ordered the Challah bread french toast, it was dry and didn't even look like it was Challah bread. Mine was worse, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. The flavor of the pork was good but that's about it. It looked like dog food, and the order of the ingredients were all wrong. The egg was burried under pounds of pork so when I found it to cut, the yolk had already disappeared in the beans below it. They make a tortilla shell act as the base in a bowl, like a taco salad, so it's hard to include the tortilla with each bite. The pork was so watery/greasy that after a while the whole bowl was just a bowl of mush. Friendly wait staff though, fairly attentive, so they can refill your water or coffee well."}
{"text":"We decided to go for brunch here on Sunday since our friend was visiting from out of town. The parking was a little chaotic but once we found some we headed on in. They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is great during the cooler months but I would avoid it during the hot months for sure.

The menu has your typical sandwiches for lunch and breakfast options. I decided to try the breakfast grilled cheese. For the price it was huge and they even added avocado to it as well as tomatoes. If anything get your egg over easy, it gives it an even better taste. We tried the side of biscuits and gravy and it was amazing! Definitely worth it even though they were a bit on the pricey side.

I would have loved to have given this place 5 stars but the prices were a little high for what we received and the parking was a bit of a mess. Also call in reservations if possible so you don't have to wait as long. Definitely worth a visit if you are near Scottsdale on a Sunday and searching for brunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Scottsdale. Their service is always friendly and the atmosphere is bright and cheery. Most recent visit I had ice coffee, which came out in like a jug, so I took it with me and enjoyed it all morning. The egg white omelette with veggies is light and tasty, I get it with salsa to give it some extra flavor. The fruit is always bright and a good portion. Sitting on the street is noisy, but it's worth it to enjoy the sunshine. If you are visiting town pick an off day to brunch here to avoid a big crowd."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast! They offer the option to get in line to make the wait a little shorter and even when you are waiting you can order coffee and juice drinks from the bar! My husband and I both had omelettes (the Tuscan and the meat lovers version), we had a side of biscuits and gravy and a pancake. Way too much food but we were on vacation. All of it was excellent. The only thing I didn't care for were the potatoes but that is just a personal preference."}
{"text":"I've eaten here too much, they don't have many vegetarian options and the tomato soup is ridiculously bad.

Go to \"Daily Dose\" a few blocks south and you'll be much happier. \"Bacon\" was also nearby and so much better, but they didn't make it.  Even a restaurant named \"Bacon\" had more vegetarian options. 

Not sure why this place draws the crowds anymore, it just doesn't stack up."}
{"text":"I've been to the Cityscape Breakfast Club a couple times, but this was my first time at the Scottsdale location. I must say, I do like this location and the Breakfast Club as a whole but I do prefer their other location. This one is much louder and has more of a cafe vibe to it and is more open. It is also quite a bit more loud, seeing as you are right next to the road. Other than that, it's very nice! The wait was not too bad for 2 people in June, about 10 minutes. We had the nuts and berries waffle, eggs Benedict, and Lox and Cream cheese. The waffle was light and fluffy and had delicious, ripe berries as well as candied nuts. My partner said that the eggs Benedict was alright, but nit his favorite. He much preferred the Lox and Cream cheese and I have to say I agree. The salmon is very nice, it has a light smoky flavor that is perfect on a bagel with cream cheese and capers. Our waitress was very courteous and the rest of the wait staff was helpful, and ready to clear plates. Overall, I was satisfied with my experience here and would recommend it. But if you are able to, get yourself on the wait list as this is one of the most popular brunch spots in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Our waitress was a little preoccupied but it was quite busy. The amount of food we received was huge! We couldn't finish it all and the apple juice...amazing. If we're ever in Scottsdale again, I want to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I am glad that I remembered this place for brunch this past Saturday because it was good food and I love the atmosphere in the area as well.  I went with my BF and we put our name in, got some coffee and was seated quicker than the time the originally gave us, which is great in my book.  

I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  I wasnt a fan of it, it was good but not GREAT.  The chorizo really lacked flavor and punch...maybe I am use to the chorizo I get back home.  My bf had pancakes with ice cream on top of it and it looked amazing and he loved it.

I would come back and probably will to try some of there other things.  This is not a place to go to thinking you will get in and out quick, there are almost always people waiting but the walk around Old Town Scottsdale is worth it."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Be prepared to wait for up to an hour, but well worth it. We will be back in Scottsdale in a few weeks and we plan on going back to the Breakfast Club. The border bowl is my fav!"}
{"text":"I am sure it's good but the way they accommodate families is not very \"family friendly\". We came in and we were kept waiting, way beyond our time and watched other large groups after us get seated before us because we had kids and the table that was sitting didn't want to sit next to kids.  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Took over an hour to sit, and over an hour to get our food. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was SOOOO EXCITED to eat here.

For realz.

I love breakfast foods.  Of all kinds.

But I would rather eat at IHOP than this place.  Honestly.

I've tried all their variations on the eggs benedict, and found them all to be so disgusting they bordered on inedible.

A friend of mine insists that I should return to this place and order a \"sweet\" breakfast, but I'm scared and very hesitant to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Was there again this weekend - thought I'd give a shout out because this place is SO good. Haven't been since the remodel, which is amazing. The space is huge now and so warm and inviting. The traditional eggs benedict is to die for as well as their potatoes. Not to mention their fruit. I swear they have a farm out back and pick it fresh. Probably one of the best places for breakfast in AZ."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've ever had. The Southwest Breakfast options were on POINT. Food was quick and so delicious. I may plan a trip back to Arizona just for this brunch."}
{"text":"People that are giving this place only 2 stars are absolutely insane.  This place has the best service.  I went on a sunday morning...got there and they said it was going to be a 25 minute wait...sat at the bar 1 minute there after and immediately had my order taken.  Food came out in less the 5 minutes.  My boyfriend got the quick start fully loaded for just under $8 and no play on words but it was there quickly and it was indeed fully loaded.  This place really knows how to serve a full portion meal for a great price.  I recommend trying any one of the omelets as well because they are big, fluffy, and full of great ingredients.  Everything on the menu seems to come with fruits and potatoes (which come with the best green, yellow, and red peppers ever).  Try this place out the next time you want a great breakfast in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the Best breakfast ever sat at the bar two days got to know the staff wonderful people happy to be there working and the food was great thank you breakfast club"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a nice setting, there's a lot of variety. The orders are large, so bring your appetite. They offer coffee to go, which I thought was nice. We had the option of sitting outside. Service was ok."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I LOVE this place.  I've never had a dish I didn't like here.  The energy is great, the people are fun.  I wish there were MORE room!  And I wish the misters had a little more \"oomph\" out on the patio during the summer, but what are you gonna do?  If you have friends in town and you're looking for a foolproof breakfast joint The Breakfast Club is it."}
{"text":"The Challah Bread French Toast was unique.   A good menu with items that are not associated with the normal \"breakfast place.\"  

Busy place but efficient and friendly.  I would love to go back again if I make it back in the area from Chicago."}
{"text":"I love everything bagels.  When the waitress said I could substitute over the English muffin......heaven.  Lots of egg bacon cheese and horseradish goodness."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after hearing good things about this place. However, I ordered eggs Benedict with the pork and the eggs were hard poached. Not a drop of runny yolk in sight. Now the pork and hollandaise  was tasty, but the hard egg pretty much killed an otherwise creative take on a classic. 

My wife got a protein platter with steak. She asked for mid-well (I know.... I know ...). What she got was rare verging in blue and eggs that had zero flavor. Not much taste in the veg either. 

The waitress was kind and offered to get new eggs but I had already consumed half the dish. It just didn't seem worth it. They did take the steak back, but then they just seared off the cut part and it was still rare throughout. 

The waitress did take the protein platter off our ticket which is why this is  3 instead of 1. They maybe just had a bad day. But I probably won't choose to go back."}
{"text":"We love this place. Service is great! But bring back the regular Tuscan Omelet! The new one is horrible!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Great atmosphere, great design and decor, great crowd, and great employees.  I kept coming here every morning it was so good. The thick bacon was amazing, and I appreciate the small serving of fruit they include.  All the food was tasty and ample. Very good quality ingredients.  Parking around back is a little tight and tricky. Get here early on the weekends or you'll have a bit of a wait unless you want to sit at the counter.  Definitely GO!"}
{"text":"We had build your own omelettes. They were great, not too greasy but fluffy and light.  Their hash browns melt in your mouth yet maintain the crispiness.  They also have delicious jalapeno biscuits those were very good also. Overall one of the better breakfasts I have had."}
{"text":"After this place, Tryst Cafe, and Desert Sage, the Breakfast Club in Old Town is still hands down the BEST breakfast place. I keep trying other places but cannot find a closer alternative.

The best blubbery and chocolate chip pancakes anywhere and the OJ is AMAZING. Best combination of sweet and cold. Service is alway fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I leave unimpressed. If I had to sum up the Breakfast Club in one word, it'd be \"meh.\" And if you don't consider \"meh\" to be a word, perhaps sampling the fare here would change your mind. 

The service is consistently so-so. A solid 5 out of 10. My order has in some way been messed up more often than not, and it always takes a lot longer than you'd expect for a breakfast place. There's not really any ambience to speak of. An awkward side patio overlooking busy Scottsdale Road is perhaps their best feature. 

Finally for the food. Although nothing has ever been terrible, I've also never sampled anything to write home about. And for the average plate being $9-$11, shouldn't it be well above average?? The answer is yes. Don't be duped by Scottsdale's higher price tag for, well, everything...Higher price should still equal better quality period!!

My final frustration is with their limited options for dietary modifications. I am vegetarian and I recently dined with a friend who is gluten free. I had to severely reduce my order to fit into the vegetarian requirements (they don't even have vegetarian black beans or any of their speciality sauces such as queso or green chili that don't have meat in them!!). No gluten free bread or pancake options...yet this is the \"breakfast club\"...enough people are vegetarian and/or gluten free in this day and age...shouldn't Breakfast Club get with the times??"}
{"text":"We had a fine brunch but it was nothing to write home about. We will not be back to have breakfast or brunch here. It was nice to have some vegan options though! Service was great."}
{"text":"I'll be gentle, as there is no negative star listed on the grading scale. I consider myself an adventurous and easy to please type of guy but there are limits. After successfully scanning previous reviews, I decided to partake of a Tex-Mex breakfast experience in Scottsdale AZ. Boy was I disappointed. In fact, in the defense of the chefs, perhaps certain delicacies are best suited for an acquired taste. My primary complaint is not food but service. Well, partial. My waitress was warm and helpful. However, some form of kitchen management returned a meal that was not to my liking and basically said, \"deal with it\". Her exact words were..\"we take great pride in our food\"....and \"I won't take this off your tab\"...and \"the menu states the ingredients\". Ummmm. First, I have a doctorate. I can read. Secondly, I never asked for a free meal. I just returned it and asked for something else. I walked in with 850.00 of pocket change but was treated like a vagabond. Guess what lady, I'm also contacting Fodors. Any service industry business must be first concerned with the satisfaction of your customers. They can make or break you. Perhaps you will learn.

Even after this poor manager service experience, I left my waitress Christie a 50.00 tip. Never judge a book by its cover!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with a friend and everything was really good! I would definitely recommend their white chocolate mocha!"}
{"text":"This place has great salty dog cocktails and egg sandwiches. The rest of the food is mediocre and definitely avoid busy times. You can be waiting up to an hour, the service is very slow. Try to get a seat at the bar if one is open. There are a lot of brunch options in old town, this one is not the best. As a side note, maybe avoid ordering spinach. They don't wash it very well and I ended up with a bug in my food. They apologized and replaced it. But it was still kind of gross."}
{"text":"My brother recommended this place from his visit to Baylor's Fiesta Bowl. I had the four cheese omlette, which was absolutely amazing. Service was quick, friendly, and attentive. 

I took a star away for the average side dishes and decor.

Excellent find!"}
{"text":"The food was great the server who took care of us was even better but I was there with a group of six people for less than an hour and they kicked us out IMMEDIATELY after we paid we were still drinking our alcoholic beverages and it was super unprofessional especially considering my friends and I rarely spend time together and it was a special event for us."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. It's very busy so I love that they used a text to notify you and that you can see your place in line. They service was good and fast. The food was yummy."}
{"text":"This place seems super popular. It's always packed - no matter the day of the week. I'm told the owner is the same as Stax in the same building, and they used to own the now closed Upton - both of which I love. BC though . . .  nothing super exciting about the breakfast here. I'm not a fan of their bloody mix, and while a mimosa is huge, it's not that tasty. I'd rather have taste. I've tried it a few times and none of the items I had were worth writing home about. There are so many great breakfast places that I don't need to return."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATE this place.  THe service is the worst service I have ever had in a restauant, and the wait is not even worth it.  You can tell their food is half-assed.

They make you wait at least 30 minutes for a table, and amongst that every person who works there is just RUDE and UNHELPFUL.  I HATE this place with a passion, and I would encourage NO ONE to eat here.  It's a waste of time and money.

The food barely comes out hot, and its sloppy, not done right, and not that good.  I've been here probably 4-5 times to give it more chances, but I'm done wasting my money here."}
{"text":"I know I'm dreadfully late with this review but as I keep all receipts, here we go!  They accommodated our entire family of six adults and one child at one long group of tables very well.  We got there first and had to wait for the rest of the gang which was fine as we watched food go past us and had our coffee and juice.

This place does fill up rapidly so either get there early or after the crowds have come and gone.  The service was good as was the food.  As it was family we all took bites of each others meals of hash browns, shroom omelet, and a nice salmon Benedict ($14.00).  Wish we had ordered the french toast because it did look very good.  

There were no complaints from anyone at our table about food or service and for our entire party the bill was $68.00 which was for food and drinks.  The decor is a bit retro but nice and the view of Scottsdale while you nom is great...especially if you are from someplace that doesn't have mountains and palm trees."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club really got me excited. I mean first of all it's named after a movie that I really love. Secondly it's pretty cute and the patio has those misters that are ubiquitous in Phoenix. But, the thing that really got my pulse racing was the idea of jalapeño biscuits and gravy. I've said over and over how I'm always looking for delicious biscuits and gravy and have such a hard time finding them. I thought I may have struck gold with the addition of jalapeños.

Unfortunately I didn't. The meal was just okay. The thing that made it weird for me was that there was a layer of biscuits, then a layer of cheese, then the gravy which was topped with eggs. I like eggs, but usually on the side. I love cheese, but I really only wanted the gravy on the biscuits. 

Oh well, each to his or her own. The place was cute, the servers friendly and I'd go back to try something else if I were back in town."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good breakfast in a classy place, this is the restaurant for you.  My friends and I took our cars up Camelback for a photoshoot at 7:00AM on a Sunday morning, but were saddened when we saw that a black Jetta with steamy windows had beaten us to the spot.  We left dejected but decided on this place for breakfast.  It was hands down the best breakfast I have ever bought.  The orange juice was fresh squeezed, the waitresses were pretty, punctual, and polite, the buckwheat and chocolate chip pancakes were fantastic, and the restaurant's atmosphere was pleasant and classy.  You'll pay a bit more for a meal (OJ and chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon was $17, not including tip), but it will be totally worth it.  I'll be taking my next girlfriend here for sure."}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a friend who said this place was great. Came here with another friend while visiting AZ from San Diego, friend from North Carolina. We sat down and was greeted promptly by our server. We had drinks brought right away.

I really liked the fresh OJ. I order the Turkey Bene. I thought it was realy good! The turkey was very juicy along with the hollandaise and and poached egg. The fruit was a little too ripe but no biggy. 

I thought this place had a good vibe to it. I'd definitely go back and see what the servers think is the best thing to get. :-)

Overall maybe 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club is like a combination of Lululemon and Ihop. OK it's a lot more upscale and serves a whole different level of food but you get the visual. It's a unique environment because all the staff wear what seems to be yoga or workout pants. Pretty casual there, but makes it trendy. You can also see into the kitchen which is pretty interesting.
The coffee/tea/juice bar is great! So many healthy options makes it defintiely worth coming back for.

But what really makes this spot special is the food. Plenty of spice and flavor.Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal and we all had unique dishes. The portions are really big too (almost too big) but these were leftovers I was looking forward to eating."}
{"text":"Very nice, good atmosphere but like most places nowadays very loud and open. Service was wonderful and we had the biscuits and gravy  and a bacon and egg breakfast grilled cheese with hash Browns that was very good. The biscuits and gravy could it had a little more flavor but it was OK."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. As long as the good servers are working and the restaurant isn't packed, they do a great job. The food is always great and their coffee is awesome!"}
{"text":"Because of the positive reviews, I stupidly tried this place for the third time.
I feel as though sitting t the counter was bothersome to the wait staff.  They barely spoke, and trying to get a second cup of coffee was met with rolling eyes as I interrupted their own discussions about a date night.
Limited coffee was fine as it did taste like dishwater.  And really - it is only an egg, not worth the pretentiousness."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a beautiful part of Scottsdale. The breakfast dish I ate was amazing. I highly recommend the Huevos Con Masa. It was unlike anything I had ever eaten before. Service was good and the waitresses are beautiful. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! The food is great, but the wait staff is what makes this place, and what has me coming back.  They are attentive and respectful, and always have us leaving on a very good note.  The biscuits and gravy are amazing and finishing it off with a chocolate chip pancake to share is a recipe for an amazing brunch."}
{"text":"Crazy good breakfast. Great service. Worth every minute of a wait. Get the masa platter thing...I don't remember the exact name but it has a masa based pancake thing. It's super good.
You go, guy/girl/corporate conglomerate. You got this breakfast thing DOWN."}
{"text":"I've been to the Breakfast Club dozens and dozens of times, but I will never  go there again. On Saturday, I attempted to go with my husband and 2 friends - and the hostesses wouldn't seat us. 

My friend and I got there and were told of a 30-40 minute wait. As we were waiting for our husbands to join us, this was no problem for us. Then..they got there, and we still weren't seated. When I went to check with the hostess, my name had been crossed off list. Now, we were waiting by the front door, but I know my name was never called. I was kind, understanding that mistakes are made, and I was informed that we would be seated next. 

She then proceeded to seat a group of our size that had arrived after us. I went back up to the hostess station and demanded to know why people who had arrived long after us were being seated before us. The hostess lied to me, telling me that she hadn't told me we were to be seated next, but that we were just \"coming up.\" 

I was shocked that I was getting the runaround, so I took the news back to my group, and as we were discussing whether or not to leave, the hostess seated ANOTHER group of our size that had just arrived instead of us. At this point we got up to leave. The hostess, seeing we were leaving, said \"you know you guys are coming up.\" Whether that was a taunt or what I will never know, but I do know that I will never go there again. 

It was ridiculous to be treated like a second class citizen while trying to get breakfast. I would rather eat at Denny's, which I loathe, as I know they will at least seat and serve me."}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins. Ok , got text table was ready. Two guys walked in ahead of us... Friends with everyone, they got our table and sadly we had to wait until they got another table ready. Ok. Then ordered decaf coffee. Not even room temp. :(  omelet with meat ... Didn't order it well done and slightly burnt.. Hold the meat. Let's just say I will be returning to the Daily Dose down the street. Not sure why we even decided why to try something new. Grass is not greener on the other side!!!! Lesson learned"}
{"text":"I bet their food is good (hence the extra star), but the coven of witches at the front have a 1-star attitude. Wouldnt know ab the food tho bc they are complete \"soup nazi's\" whenever we come in. Dont bother putting your name in their \"virtual line\" thru yelp either. Literally showed them my confirmation on my phone including correct location and the time i was standing in front of them and they were \"kind\" enough to put my name at the bottom of the list. So, i was told to wait w my 2 year old for another 40 minutes. Your EGGS arent good enough to spend another 40 mins of my time waiting for them. So, i told them to take my name off the list and the hostess didnt even look up when she told me \"perfect\" in a snide sugary tone haha. 

As usual, went just went to Morning Squeeze instead. Im done w the \"coven\""}
{"text":"Great spot to start your day. Fresh orange juice. I highly recommend just make sure you have time for waiting cause they always busy."}
{"text":"After spending a few days in the general Phoenix area I was very pleasantly surprised to see this part of town. Finally some grass and clean neighborhoods. We did go to Old Scottsdale for supper but that was at night and it wasn't this nice. We came here for breakfast because, well... its the The Breakfast Club. 

We decided to sit outside on their patio which was nice, even though it was literally along the road. A little noisy and next time I would sit on the other side of the building but nice anyway. 
The service was prompt and we were sitting within seconds of arrival. 
The menu was good. There were quite a few interesting things that you may not see on another menu. After careful deliberation we tried the Asparagus, Ham, Cheese and Onion custom omelet along with the Mignon Benedict for myself. On the menu as \"Mignon with Harris Ranch Filet, Sautéed Spinach, Bordelaise & Hollandaise\" 
I thought what a great idea, Eggs Benny with a steak and to boot I had it with shredded hash browns. The hash browns were deliciously crispy and the fresh fruit on the side was good. I ordered the sauces on the side which I would do again but this was quite good. Tender steak, spicy hollandaise and some kind of mushroom sauce. I would order this again. 
My wife enjoyed the omelet and it did look good although I didn't try it. the idea of asparagus with eggs didn't really appeal to me. She said the exact opposite in fact, declaring that she loved asparagus in omelets. Maybe some other time for me. 

Any way, this is the first place in Scottsdale / Phoenix that I ate at and would recommend or return to. Pretty darn good."}
{"text":"The food here was great!!! but the only problem I had was they were trying to seat us next to random people that had 4 kids jumping up and down and no one wants to sit right next to kids. It was basically the same table."}
{"text":"The food is good, the amount they serve is outstanding, however the service was ok and the waiting time to get a table can be over a hour. I have ate at other's places with no wait where the food was just as good. I would go back if they hire better servers and more seating. Other then that, I rate it a 3 star.  Oh the parking was kind of crazy too."}
{"text":"Food was great and menu options are awesome. And the waitresses are easy on the eyes. I would come back here anytime I'm in town. You won't leave here hungry."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Food was great, service was super friendly!  Love coming here, every time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to only have to wait 10 minutes for a seat here, as there seems to always be a wait (as there is with every breakfast place in Old Town).  The food is good, and there are lots of options (even super healthy options, which I was impressed with! The Health Conscious breakfast was delish!) The reason it gets 3 stars has to do with the service: We were seated at the bar, which was totally fine, except that upon ordering Mimosas we asked for grapefruit juice instead of orange juice and were told \"no\".  Kind of odd, but whatever, we ordered regular mimosas instead and were \"automatically\" given the large size (ie: also automatically charged for the large size).  When we asked the waitress about this, as we had wanted the regular size, she said that when you sit at the bar you are automatically given the large size unless you tell them otherwise.  Also kind of odd.  Overall, good food and not too bad of prices for Old Town, but I wasn't terribly impressed and certainly wouldn't want to wait over 45 minutes for it."}
{"text":"Good food and freindly staff. They have a nice selection on the menu. After seeing the table next to me I wish I'd of had the house specialty....blueberry pancakes. Next time........"}
{"text":"I was there for the first time for a breakfast meeting. The 4 of us ordered breakfast and talked throughout our meal. Perhaps we were taking too long as our waitress brought our bills (BTW, we were sitting for less than 1 hour at that point). She then proceeded to take my plate and place another one on top of it. Did she ask if I was finished? No, she did not. I still had my fruit and potatoes left.  Since 2 of us lingered a bit longer I left a 20% tip...She did not deserve that much with her terrible service. She then came back to our table and asked us to leave and sit somewhere up front and talk. As it is, when I sit at table that could have turned, I am sure to compensate the server well. never gave us that chance. 

I was so angry, I decided not to tell the Manager because I would not have behaved well. I will never go back and not only will I not recommend it, I will be sure to tell many others!"}
{"text":"Loved that we were able to reserve a spot through the Yelp app! 

The restaurant is spacious and has outdoor seating.  Service was prompt without being overwhelming.  The food overall was good.  My daughters pancake was a bit undercooked but she was more interested in my meal.  I'd stop here again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Booo!  

When a restaurant is super busy, very popular and has large crowds, it can mean two things - it's an awesome place to eat or you're going to have bad service and cold food.  For us it was the latter.  

We were taken to the patio (dog friendly) to be seated. I don't own a dog and I find it repulsive to be sitting next to someone else's dog while I eat!  My chair was right by a the door to the patio.  We asked to be seated inside.  

Waitress took our order and it was about 20-30 minutes before we were finally served.  I ordered an OMELET MY WAY and did not get it my way!  All there was on the plate was an omelet, no fruit and no side of bacon.  The bacon was in the omelet which I did not request.  A different waitress took it back to the kitchen and returned the plate with a side of bacon and hash browns (which I didn't ask for). My fruit with whipped cream also arrived and was the best part of the meal.  The hash browns were cold and the bacon was cold and leathery.  My whole meal and experience was screwed up.  

Then Mister Manager himself said something about our waitress having personal problems with her father because she never returned to follow up on our meal or provide the bill.  If it was me, I would let her go home to deal with it and get another waitress to take care of the patron, instead he just kind of stood off to the side.  I'm not sure what his purpose was.

The bill was screwed up because they charged for items I didn't ask for and didn't charge me for items I got.  

I don't think I'll be eating here anytime soon.   The second star is for my husband's breakfast which was good and correct."}
{"text":"I visited the Breakfast Club this morning 8/9/17. I was there at 10:00 am. I got right in no wait. My server took my drink order almost immediately. I ordered the BC Sandwich with my Lemonade. My sandwich came out in 5 minutes. The sandwich was good, fresh and hot. The menu prices are very reasonable. The server was nice however no WOW experience. She never did a check back and the bus person took my plate after she presented the check. I asked for a refill on my Lemonade and she said refills aren't free. I thought that seemed pretty strange for a casual breakfast / lunch restaurant. I did appreciate that she told me before just charging me. The restaurant was fairly clean however it had a terrible odor not a food smell. I was in the back of the restaurant and noticed it was worse. It wasn't a pleasant smell. I might return if I was in the area but probably wouldn't refer to friends."}
{"text":"Great egg white omlette. Service was awesome. Would have gone for a 5 if they had served the jalapeno cornbread HOT! Super location:)"}
{"text":"Came here during the week since friends were in town. About a 10 min wait at about 1130am. Got seated outside and order a Bloody Mary. OMG. A little on the spicy side but garnished with a pickle, green olive and a Peperoncini. Delicious ! Being so close to the traffic seems strange on the patio but hey, it's Snobsdale... our meals came and we were not disappointed! My eggs were done perfect everyone else's dishes were superb! Nice menu full of breakfast and lunches you won't want to miss"}
{"text":"I overall liked the atmosphere of this location, however I felt my waiter was really fake, I would ask her questions and she would give me one worded answers, she would ask everyone around the bar if they needed anything, but Skip me. I wouldn't say she was rude, just fake. I felt like she was being a smart Alex. 

The young lady working at the bar should learn to treat all customers the same.

I don't remember her name, she was a Caucasian blonde, working at the bar."}
{"text":"It's the only possible explanation for this place.
Why would anyone spend ten minutes looking for a parking spot a half mile away, stand in line for forty-five minutes among a gaggle of droopy-eyed young people whose faces are wearing the previous night's story, only to have the effort rewarded with extremely slow service and mediocre food?

I think it's called \"misery loves company.\"

Well I'm pretty miserable most mornings, but I don't feel the need to make my miserable worse by standing in a line gawking at others equally as miserable, eating food that's miserable, and becoming even more miserable after my server, who I think may be related to David Copperfield, mysteriously vanishes, only to reappear with a smile and a check. 

Here's a tip Breakfast Club. Hangovers require water.
Lots and lots of water."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised to see these guys don't have a higher rating.  They came highly recommended by the manager from our hotel and we loved everything.  Cool, laid-back kind of hipster atmosphere.  As much as possible in Scottsdale anyway.  A lot of the food is made from scratch including the hollandaise sauce which delish.  My wife ordered the salmon lox eggs Benedict and I order the BC something sandwich which was their spin on a french dip.  Sweet potato fries were tasty and maybe the best french dip I've had.  The Aus Jus was nothing to write home about but they had this awesome pesto mayo that more than made up for it.  I would definitely recommend going there for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Good food and large portions but you'll have to WAIT a long time because this place is popular."}
{"text":"Excellent.    Good service. Food was great. Nice outside setting.   Would suggest for everyone to visit."}
{"text":"I think this place is an over crowded, diner. I was incredibly unimpressed with what I got after such a long wait. With so many great brunch spots near it I will definitely never be back."}
{"text":"I effing LOVE TBC.  Located smack dab in the middle of \"the scene\" its truely the best breakfast place in town.  Apparently its the thing to do to actually shower and change from the night before prior to arriving so you can watch the rest of us stumble in looking like hell.  Whatever.  While you wait for a table (and you WILL wait for a table), sit outside on the patio and people watch some of Scottsdale's finest.  

The Breakfast club isnt all about being the \"it\" place to be though, its also about the food.  Those of you who just came from the gym might want to try the egg white veggie omelet or the best oatmeal this side of the Mississip...  Those of us nursing a killer hangover might stick to the cinnamon challah french toast, benedict-style eggs, or belgian waffles...  You'll never want your loser boyfriend to make you breakfast in bed again.

Lunch at TBC is round two of fabulousness.  Salads, sandwiches, sweet potato fries...  I'm suddenly starving.

Dont let the line or the wave of D&G sunglasses outside deter you from waiting for the best meal of the week at the Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"Excellent eggs Benedict: the ham was thick, the eggs were perfectly prepared, the hollandaise sauce was buttery without too much garlic or citrus."}
{"text":"Good food, good location.  One quick recommendation.  Tone down your portions on certain items, namely the Eggs Benedict.  Maybe offer a half portion or something.  It was a good dish but, as I am currently not subscribing to a 7,500 calorie a day diet, it is too much.  The waffle was the best this side of Over Easy."}
{"text":"I have been to The Breakfast Club on several occassion and have never been entirely impressed. I'm not much for going to a restaurant to see and be seen. I go to eat! The restaurant is small and the outdoor seating is placed in the middle of a fairly busy Scottsdale sidewalk. The wait is usually long and there isn't much room to wait without feeling like you are in the way of a waitress.

Their breakfast potatoes are very good but the entrees have left me a bit unsatisfied. My lunch experience has been better in that the Buffalo Mozz Salad is worth going back for if you're in the neighborhood. It  offers a large portion of caprese salad with a heaping pile of mixed greens. Yum!

All-in-all... a decent meal but often too busy with beautiful people to be worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went with my friend for Sunday Brunch a few weeks back and was very impressed. I ordered the Huevos Con Masa, and it was very tasty. The flavors were so well blended! I thought it would be too rich, but it was just perfect!

My friend got The Bird, he gave me a bite and I was so jealous I didn't order it. The creamy cheese in the omelet was to die for! I am looking forward to going back to order it!

The atmosphere was very comfortable and we didn't have to wait too long, so the overall experience was good! 

If you are looking for a good brunch spot, I would recommend The Breakfast Club....cute name and easy to remember!"}
{"text":"While spending an extended weekend in Scottsdale, I had breakfast here twice.  Can't say enough good things about this place.

Staff are all super friendly, and everyone's fit & in great shape.  Is that a requirement to work here!? 

Their homemade V8 style juice is great, as is their cold brew coffee.

They offer an extensive breakfast menu, and I had a great vegetable omelette one day and a steak and eggs Benedict another.  Also tried some of a friend's pancakes.  Everything was fresh and well prepared, and prices were reasonable.

If I lived in AZ  I would def. frequent the Breakfast Club*.


*Also, awesome name right? Who doesn't love a Brat Pack reference...."}
{"text":"Ambience is cool and trendy! There's nothing this place doesn't have- love love love! Patio is sunny, the bar is quick and I loved everything I got.  I'm here visiting but I'll def go back tomorrow.  Oh and the music is good too!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate graduation and had the worst possible experience of my life.  We had a group of 5 total. We decided to go have a couple drinks at the bar before being seated.  We ordered 4 mimosas (5 but brother didn't have his ID) which came out to 50 dollars.  Three of us had seats at the bar and two were standing behind.  We were having a great time but after 15 min of sitting there the bartender/waitress comes up to us and says in a rude tone, \"usually we reserve these spaces for people who are eating, would you move over to the waiting area\".   I understand that it was busy and that she wanted to make more money off of new customers but we had ordered a pretty expensive round of drinks and were waiting to get our table to spend more money on food.  It was quite insulting that they would have the nerve to ask us to leave from the bar.  We did not leave and she grunted and left then proceeded to talk shit to the other bartenders only a few feet from us.   Finally we were seated.  We decided to let go of what had happened and still enjoy ourselves.  When we got our food a manager came up to us.  He rudely started telling us that it is illegal for someone without an id to drink from other peoples drinks (my brother) and that two waitresses had told him this was happening.  My brother had not taken one sip from a drink on the table, beisdes his water.  We tried to explain nicely to him that he had not taken a sip, and the manager started to become extremely rude and not listen. He then began  raising his voice and not only interrupting our breakfast but the other patrons that were sitting on the patio as well.  The food was mediocure and the service was horrendous.  Never going back again.  They did not even comp our meal which had turned into a disaster.  What happened to the customer is always right? These people teamed up against us and main my graduation breakfast a horrible experience."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary tasted like the mix went south. Menu changed to a meat fest, but they did let me order a mushroom omelette that was dry and flavorless even with salsa and Cholula sauce. First Watch from now on."}
{"text":"I liked this place! Nice interior layout, great plate presentations, and i enjoyed the flavors of the breakfast dishes! Its loud in here, but its a great place to definitely enjoy brunch with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Food is completely average but they get much love from me because they have the best chai I have ever had in my whole life.  If there is a wait, grab a chai to go and skip down the street to a better breakfast."}
{"text":"Fun, lively, good food, and almost no available parking. That about sums up the Breakfast Club on most days. While I was fortunate to get seating right away (at the bar), there were several other couples that had to wait between 15-20 minutes for a seating area not at the bar, nor outside (there is water mist provided outside). 

Saturdays are raucous with locals and tourists alike, so try to get here early. Mimosas are served here all day long, yet I'm not certain about when beer, wine & spirits start to be served. Friendly & attentive staff throughout. The Tinga Chicken Frittata omellette ($11) is completely on point here, and hard to mess up! With the avocado, the blend of light seasoning and vegetables fall effortlessly down your esophagus. Just pure bliss. The Cold Brew Nitro? Absolutely outstanding. Even better are the prices. For Scottsdale? Very, very reasonable. 

The one annoying thing at the Breakfast Club is the parking. Good luck. Very tight, extremely limited. Although there is a restaurant next door that seems to open late, why take the chance of getting towed? I'd park further down the street, if necessary. 

Altogether, this is on par with Lolo's Waffles for Scottsdale breakfast options. And like Lolo's, it is loud, loud, LOUD up in here!"}
{"text":"I think that the atmosphere and the staff was great. Things were very busy on a Sunday so it makes sense things took a little long to get to the table. Me and my girlfriend ordered eggs Benedict, and a breakfast burrito with chorizo queso. The food came out warm not hot. The fruit looked very dried out, and old. My biggest problem with the food was that it was flavorless. The potatoes were diced potatoes cooked with bell pepper, and had no seasoning whatsoever. The eggs Benedict did not have any flavor either. A little salt and pepper was all they needed, but I had to do that myself.. I usually love eggs benedict everywhere I go, but this was the worst I've had ever, mainly because it was so bland. My girlfriend had similar complaints about her burrito, but I can't really speak for her dish. It is a very nice place with a great atmosphere I would consider possibly coming again , and ordering something different."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast yesterday. It has been a little while since I've been in but it seems like they've still go it! My server is newer but she was really enthusiastic, prompt and helpful with all of my questions. It's a shame I was in a pork mood, because she doesn't eat pork but she was great with recommendations. The eggs Benedict were phenomenal and came out pretty quick as well. 
What got me though was what I assumed to be their manager... She was wearing a floral top instead of the BC clothing, longer brown hair. It seems she spent the whole time goofing off with the staff, taking photos on her phone and not really paying attention to the restaurant. As someone who works in the restaurant business I found this to be really unprofessional. The food and service were great, but I know I've never worked anywhere where the staff can behave that way, let alone the management."}
{"text":"I love John Hughes movies, but this Breakfast Club did not live up to its namesake. The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate. 

Overall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives."}
{"text":"Nice food, cute atmosphere, crappy service, and a $5 discount to make up for an extra 30 minutes of our time.  

My friend put our name in just before 9:50am and was told there would be about a 20 minute wait - sure, no problem.  After about 35 minutes, we asked what was happening and the hostess had somehow lost our name (even though my friend saw her write it down).  Somehow, it took almost another 10 minutes to seat us after that (but at least we were waiting inside), and then the server took ages to appear at the table.

Once our server took the order (I may have barked that we were in a hurry, irritated after waiting at the table with no greeting), the food came out quickly and exactly like we ordered it.  My friend and I each had an omelet, and they were both fresh and light and cooked perfectly.  

When the bill came, they'd knocked $5 off the check for our trouble.  That was nice of them, but, frankly, they didn't seem at all sorry (thought they said the words).  I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot in Arizona!! I try to go at least once a week. Make sure to try the bacon too :)"}
{"text":"As most people have said, the wait is long. If you have the time and you're not too hungry, it's worth it. I think that breakfast joints on the weekends tend to be busy, anyway, so I, as impatient as I am, expect a line. Oh, and having the $ is good, too, since their breakfast is slightly more expensive than most. 

The omelets are huge (what is that, like 6 eggs?!), and it's nice that they have a huge selection of ingredients to make your own combo. But the Eggs Benedict selection--that's where it's at. Seriously, folks...they have Eggs Benedict with filet mignon. Drool."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service has always been wonderful. The food is outstanding. The coffee is amazing. I love the atmosphere, great big windows to look at the bustling downtown area. My favorite breakfast spot to go to.  Prices are very fair.The only legitimate complaints people have is that it gets busy. Well it's busy for a reason, so if you have the time it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot right in Scottsdale with killer menu options. You can go from extreme healthy eating to adding a few calories to your diet...but whichever you choose you can't go wrong! Inside info...try the sweet potato fries with a side of the warm caramel dip that is used to the banana fosters French toast...you'll thank me after!"}
{"text":"Great place, amazing food! Loved it. I went on a Sunday and the wait was pretty long, you can get into the waitlist through yelp which helps a lot, once you arrived just let them know you are there. Perhaps, make sure you have your complete party with you as they will not let you sit if people are not there yet, that happened to me. Besides that everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"What mediocre at best experience this was. You know when you walk into a place and you feel like they're doing YOU a favor ? That's now I felt at The Breakfast Club. I've over decade of experience in the industry, opened restaurants and trained people across the coast so this I feel like I have a tad of credibility. I sat at the bar and was greeted or better yet, \"acknowledged\" by the brunette girl working this area. She never once smiled, asked me any questions about menu, If I've been there etc. flopped down the menu and walked away. I ordered the lox/cream cheese set up because I do think they do a good job here with that. Coffee is horrible but the food came out quick. It was $14 but it's Scottsdale and was a good amount so I don't mind. She dropped the check half way through my meal without asking how anything was. I pain, left $4 on $17. Over 20%. She picked up the check, entered her tip in the computer and never looked back to say thank you. Food was good, service was 1 star. Not only will I not come back, I won't refer anyone or bring visitors. This type of experience gives Scottsdale its pretentious reputation.  Deuces B-club."}
{"text":"This place in two words....FIRST CLASS.  I was told about this place from a cabbie (Thanks) I ordered two breakfast plates the next morning and no regrets, everything was put together like I was eating in house, I can only imagine what the in house service is like.....Oh I did I mention the food was GREAT!!!!! 

I will recommend this establishment to all......"}
{"text":"This place was packed Saturday morning. I loved that you can grab a morning cocktail or coffee while you wait!! Cafe Au Lait was wonderful!! I had steak & eggs for breakfast. It was cooked perfectly!!! Love, love, love. I would definitely go here again!!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place unfortunately I had the worst omelet of my life here, the mushroom omelette. It tasted completely dried out and spongy like they cooked it in one of those microwave omelette dishes.  My friends that I was dining with enjoyed their meal. 

The filet mignon Benedict was the favorite at the table. Service could have been a bit faster but it was adequate. My friends raved about how good their juices were because they were supposedly all homemade in house with juicers. My pineapple juice taste like anything you would buy in the supermarket so I'm not sure if that is really they case."}
{"text":"Best place in downtown Scottsdale for breakfast. The nutty waffle, Holla for Challah French Toast, bacon, and  and eggs benedict are very good. The breakfast burrito is the best deal in downtown Scottsdale. I have never had a bad meal. 

Is always crowded on Sat and Sunday AM and the wait is about 15 minutes. Good wait service and timely delivery of food."}
{"text":"This place is yum-tastic.  Only got to visit twice while staying in Scottsdale but I WILL be back!  The jalapeno biscuits and gravy were so awesome my fianceé and I had to get it twice although I wish I would've had time to come again and try something else.

Service was OK.  The waitress was not outgoing or welcoming, she gave us a weird vibe.

Loved that eating outside wasn't too loud with the traffic."}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars only due to the waitress, who I believe tried her very best, and to the fact that my husband's experience was very different from mine.
That being said, the food here made me ill, literally. My stomach is churning as I write this. I can only assume it is due to the undercooked eggs I was served. After eating half and egg, and bacon, I complained, I nicely explained to my waitress that I was rather grossed out and didn't want a replacement. She took my plate and said she'd talk to the manager. When she returned she explained that the manager had taken $2 off our bill. The manager didn't even come talk to us. I know I could have made a scene but frankly just didn't feel like it. I wasn't even going to write a bad review but now that I am laying here trying not to run to the bathroom, I have changed my mind. 
My husband's food seemed fine and as I said the waitress really tried to provide good service in a bad situation that wasn't her fault. Still I will not be back."}
{"text":"Let's just say that this should be one of your top choices when in the Scottsdale area. Their starter breakfast for 6.95 FN rocks! 

Service is really goods and all of the components are fresh. The patio runs along Scottsdale's main drag. Awesome when the weather is nice. A very clean and well maintained establishment. 

So grab your paper, laptop, or just sit with friends and absorb your surroundings. Two thumbs up for this restaurant.

{"text":"What a great breakfast. I sat at bar and met some people. Great place to just trade talk. Food was great. Staff was great. Place was great. Go here people. Go."}
{"text":"Place rocks.  Happening, music, good vibes, good people and great food.  Customer service was superb and it was super inexpensive.  Overall good feel for a breakfast spot with lots of energy.  They accidentally put bacon on my wife's meal but she doesn't eat meat. They were super cool about redoing it and then took it off the bill. We were so surprised with the service."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years so I figured I would finally give it a try. I wasn't disappointed but wasn't impressed either. We tried it on a Saturday which we were expecting it to be crazy busy, which it was but the wait wasn't too bad about 20 min. Thankfully we got sat outside which I where I was hoping to sit. It's a good place to people watch and everyone is always cruising their newest ride up and down scottsdale trying to show it off. I had the buckwheat pancakes which were recommended by the waitress and my hubby had an omelet with every kind of meat imaginable in it. My pancakes were ok, a little dry, my husbands omelet was fantastic. I would probably give this place a go again but wld try something else"}
{"text":"When you say Breakfast Club, I say awesome '80s flick full of detention and dancing through hallways -- but let's save that gnarly story for another day. 

Many a morning, I'll pass The Breakfast Club and there's a line out the door like bacon's going out of style. At first, I wondered what it was all about. Then I ate there and have since been back over and over and over again. It's pretty good! Worth the wait? I'm going with a solid...heck ya if you have the time to spare. 

I'm an avocado snob and you can get a good selection of the buttery green goodness in any omelet or egg dish you choose...or if you just want it on the side to accompany your waffles. I love the omelet selection with the grilled veggies and salty potatoes. The pancakes are large and in charge. Their coffee is roasted like the best of them. Plus they have the option for community dining seats which can sometimes be fun and a cool way to meet new people (but they also have normal solo dining as well). 

The only main deterrent against making The Breakfast Club my go-to breakfast all the time is the wait, but I've learned that I need to go at off-times in order to avoid the line. The main hours of craziness are around 8:00-10:30 AM on the weekends -- pretty much the prime time breakfast hours. But, if you could.. let's say ... wake up a tad earlier (eek!) or make it brunch instead of breakfast, then you might avoid the lines. Otherwise, just sit tight and wait for the table. You might also try to find an excuse to have a breakfast meeting during the weekday there. It's a lot less crowded on the weekdays. Regardless, I think the wait is pretty much worth it.  You can also grab a coffee to go while you wait in case you're a caffeine addict like me (even though Diet Coke is my drug of choice) and you need your fix."}
{"text":"I'm a huge foodie, so once I moved to Phoenix I looked up the top spots to try. Don't get me wrong, this place is great! But there are others in old town scottsdale that are unfortunately better. I've been here 2-3x and have gotten the french toast, huevos rancheros and the biscuits and gravy. Everything was delicious and the staff is always extremely friendly. It's a good breakfast/brunch spot but for me, the hype is way more than I'd give it. Hence the 4 stars"}
{"text":"The only soda they have is coke. Not coke products, but Coca Cola itself. No diet coke. No Sprite. No Fanta or Mountain Dew. I repeat: NO DIET COKE. Not even Diet Pepsi. This is my nightmare."}
{"text":"Stopped in amid the hustle and bustle of a restaurant under a large remodel. No worries here. I like the look of the new decor. The booths are roomie and comfy, the tables appear a little bigger and the interior seems brighter. 

My gf ordered the Turkey Benedict. She thought it was \"great\". It was perfectly spicy, and the Hollandaise was very good.

I had the Huevos Rancheros. I have had it twice before, and it is consistently good. It could be a tad hotter, or spiced up, but I like my food hot. Like 10 out of 10 hot. Not much a gripe, just a preference.

Service was great. Server was fun, friendly, and efficient. 

We always have a good experience at The Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"Me and the Mr finally got a chance to go here.. simple, easy and well presented.. you cant go wrong here even though my fat ass only ordered a smoothie and steel cut oats.. now the Mr he ordered Eggs Benedict.. huge yummy looking portion of ooey gooey eggy goodness.. I wanted to dive face first into his plate! Instead I ate my oats and loved every bite.. perfectly cooked and served with brown sugar and milk, just like mom's before her divorce introduced her to the single life. Oh those were the days.

Id go at opening if you're hungry 'cause there is always a wait!"}
{"text":"If I lived near here, I don't think I would go anywhere else for breakfast. I would definitely be a regular.

Without a doubt, the Border Bowl I got was one of the most delicious and perfectly executed breakfasts I've ever had in my life. When I ordered it, I half expected it to come out a sloppy mess...but the fact that I loved all the ingredients won me over. I mean, I MORE than half expected a sloppy mess. How else would 4 types of meat, hash browns, chili, cheese, and 4 eggs turn out? Greasy, sloppy mess, right? You would think..but against all odds, what I got was a NON-greasy, crispy hashbrown topped, well-balanced, delicious breakfast bowl. I still have no idea how they did it.

You know what else is memorable about thsi place? The waitresses.

Yup. Plenty to look at here.

So good food...good service...yup.... I would be a regular. Until next time."}
{"text":"A great breakfast/brunch spot with really good food.  There is usually a wait, even mid morning on a weekday, so plan ahead.  They won't seat partial parties, so plan ahead for that too.  

On my most recent visit I had coffee and Eggs  Benedict.  Their coffee is truly amazing . . . very rich without being bitter.  The Eggs Benedict was also very good, with hand cut pieces of ham and REAL hollandaise.   Service always quick and efficient.  Some servers are more friendly and chatty than others, but I've always had good service.  

My one issue (and why I ave four stars rather than five) is the increasing garlic content in the sausage gravy.  My regular favorite in the past was always the biscuits and gravy (with jalapeno biscuits . . . mmmm).  Over my last several visits, the sausage gravy has been extremely garlicky, and not nearly as tasty as it used to be.  

Overall, a The Breakfast Club is great place to eat, with good service and really good food.  I'll definitely be back, and maybe even try the gravy again someday."}
{"text":"After checking out of the hotel from my staycation with the girls we decided to check grab some breakfast here since my friends absolutely love this place. It was super packed and we had to wait almost an hr for a table which was fine with me it gave us a chance to hang outside and people watch :-). 

We were all starved once we were seated so we ordered right away. I started with coffee and decided to go with one of their club plates that came with eggs, potatoes O' Brien, toast and fruit...for my meat I decided to go with sausage. The plate looked amazing when it came out but I was really disappointed with how bland everything was...the eggs which I requested to be scrambled with cheese were bland, the sausage and potatoes were also blah. I felt like I had all of this food and I was just eating it because I was hungry. The best part of the meal was the toast and the fruit, you can't mess that up! At least the service was decent :-)

I may give this place a do over but I may have to come during the week so I don't have to wait an hr for a table."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to check this place out simply because it was there and we needed to get some lunch in the area. The service was prompt, efficient and friendly. I ordered the tuna salad sandwich with cottage cheese on the side. The tuna was pretty run-of-the-mill, prepared with mayo, and sandwiched between lettuce leaves, tomatoes and two thick slices of 9 grain bread. The large dill pickle spear was a nice touch. I love cottage cheese, so that's a thumbs up. My bf's breakfast burrito was almost as large as his plate, seriously. It was huge, smothered with green chile and pretty tasty. Try as we might, there was no way we could finish our meals. I wish they had put the fruit on his plate separately, since some of the green chile sauce got onto it. Green chile covered watermelon just isn't very appetizing, you have to admit. I would go back, but only if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this one several times and have never had an issue along with the downtown Phoenix one. Until this time. I had brought a friend who has never been and apparently if your shorts are short they don't let you in after waiting for over an hour. If this was the case they should have told us that as we check in and waited over an hour. The excuse the manager gave us was that they had family's and children in there. Fashion is fashion and the fact that they saw us before and then choose not to seat is. Is it cause we aren't white?!?!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food was yummy. Fresh fruit and French toast were superior. Love the fact you can have many options in what you want to eat."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the disruptively loud music and the fact that we were quoted a substantially inaccurate wait time, ruined this breakfast for us."}
{"text":"I had a good breakfast here, but even though I have an expense account when I travel for work, I'm still not comfortable paying excessively for what is ultimately a run of the mill breakfast. I had the cinnamon French toast, a side of scrambled eggs (served lukewarm) coffee and orange juice, and my bill with tip was $25. On the bright side, the service was a lot better than the Yelp consensus, just not enough to warrant such a steep price. 

Add Molly Ringwald to the equation and it would be well worth it, but without her this Breakfast Club is just a pedestrian experience posing as something it's not."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from the Marriott. Nice simple decor. Food was good. I ordered the BC French toast and a side of pork green chili (I can have bacon or sausage anywhere). Make sure to specify you want the BC French toast or you'll get the plain French toast which is sad since you will miss out on all the yumminess that come with the BC version. The pork green chili was good, a bit heavy but worth trying if you like a lot of flavor.

The service was a bit slow for not being packed. I think that was more a kitchen issue not a server one. 

I would come back and I would also recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Expect to wait at least twenty minutes or be lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar. Food was great! Amazing flavors"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Freaking. Goodness.  AMAZING breakfast!!  One of the best ever!

We got there 10:30 am or so on a weekday... thinking maybe we would miss the early crowd. NO such luck. It was a spring training baseball day, with the Giants playing just around the corner apparently (we were going to an afternoon game too,but at a different stadium, thus we didn't know about this closer stadium-Giants).  Anyway - had to wait about 45 minutes. That was ok, because it gave us a chance to walk around some of the cute, unique shops in Olde Town!  

Got seated out on the patio (overlooking the street - so I just pretended we overlooked the ocean or something beautiful like that, ha).  Good server, fast service.

AMAZING fresh squeezed grapefruit juice for me ($7 for a large - wow), and... the BEST PART OF THE MEAL - portabello mushroom eggs benedict in the most delicious sauce EVER!!!!!!!!!!! SO SO SO wonderful!  Daughter's chocolate chip pancakes were great, and hubby and kids had normal breakfast stuff (eggs, bacon, etc) and loved it too.

So glad one of hubby's friends had told us about this place.  It's on our list of places to go to again next time we are in Scottsdale!  Go there... you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The wait on weekends is usually long.. when the hostess says it will be 25 minutes, be prepared to wait closer to 45.
However.. the food is awesome! Plus the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Like, this place is bland. I come here frequently because of the convenient location, but every time I leave like \"meh.\" A lot of calories and a lot of dollars for little satisfaction, imho. EXCEPTION: I got the steak and eggs the other day and drooled it was so good. But everything else I've had here is #basic."}
{"text":"Came here based on the recommendation of a few people we met during our stay in Scottsdale. 

We ordered:  

Breakfast Bowl - Think breakfast burrito without the tortilla and with pork green chili on top of your scramble.  

Huevos Rancheros - Breakfast tostada bowl but the tortilla is not crispy.  Topped with green chili sauce. 

Biscuits and gravy - very dense. Not too much flavor

Mushroom omelette - needed more mushroom.  Creme fraiche is pretty much sour cream. 

Overall, food was good.  Some dishes were better than others.  We recommend getting the dishes with the pork chili, since the chili was really tasty.  

Service:  Very nice.  

Ambience:  Cute, casual breakfast joint.  Pretty large place with ample seats inside and outside.

Parking: Ample rear parking 

Overall:  For food, we would give 3.5-4 stars.  Good breakfast joint but short of mind blowing. If you are near by, I'd pop in but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."}
{"text":"Our first visit of all days was on a Sunday on a holiday weekend. The wait was the norm of 25 minutes for the time of the day. The staff was friendly and professional. Once seated, the server was attentive and had a great smile. She gave us good info on the menu. With the time of day we expect a long order wait, however the food came out fast, meal recommendation is the Huevos Rancheros if you are hungry and like the taste of the south. The meal was yummy and authentic. In addition, you must try their Bloody Mary. I ordered it a little spice."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good in this very busy, loud place.

Waitresses are all heavily made-up and wearing the same outfits designed to enhance the environment.

This is a great place for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Always fresh always good. Servers are nice. This place knows how to cook bacon properly. Restrooms are clean. Good solid breakfast choice."}
{"text":"I was craving cornbread so when I saw the Huevos con Masa on the menu I got really excited. Jalapeño cornbread topped with two eggs and completed with chorizo queso. I have to admit that anything with that chorizo queso is going to taste great. 

Savory, salty, sweet, delicious!! It's a winning combination of flavors."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday morning after having driven past it quite a few times and saying \"Hey, I should try this place!\". It was sort of crowded at 8 am, but we didn't have to wait, we were seated right away. 
Service was certainly faster than I had anticipated! Our orders were taken quickly and our food was ready shortly after. I ordered the wild mushroom omelette with no dairy on it, and the server accommodated, confirmed I didn't want any dairy. Unfortunately the main thing, the omelette, was bad. Very disappointing, the four stars are because everything else was amazing! My omelette was drowning in butter. Like disgusting amounts of butter. I specifically asked for no dairy and instead it had like 3 times the butter it needed, not even exaggerating! Luckily the breakfast potatoes were the bomb and the fruit was fresh and delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his food as well! He had eggs and didn't complain about his being super buttery. So if I come back I just won't get an omelette!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place but was very disappointed. I ordered ham and eggs (over medium). Instead of a ham steak off the bone I got an oval of pressed, salty ham wanna be. Then there is the eggs. Even the most humble of restaurants is able to cook eggs over-medium properly. These were very sloppy with the whites not even cooked. I sent them back but meanwhile my breakfast mates were about done. The potatoes Obrien were just ok but not my favorite type of breakfast potatoes.  Service was fine but the waitress a little surprised that I would send something back. Perhaps the majority of diners don't know any better?"}
{"text":"Sunday morning, hour wait starting at 10:30 am. Seated right at one hour. Ordered a chai tea latte at barista bar which was very good. Ordered the BC signature French toast for breakfast. Very good meal and more than I could finish! Service as very good and timely."}
{"text":"there's always a wait here, but you can slip in and out if you have a small party.  the coffee is really good, and i'm a sucker for eggs benedict so i gave it a shot.  nothing to write home about but i was satisfied in the end.  like i say in every breakfast review: there's no better breakfast in town than the one i cook up in my kitchen."}
{"text":"We thought this place was great. They had really great omelets and the coffee was strong! There was a wait but it was worth it. The service was great. I had changed my order to substitue the eggs with egg whites and the waitress gave me NO attitude! Really a great little breakfast spot that we just happened to pass by while in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"So as often as I don't venture to Snottsdale, the movie I wanted to see was only showing here so eating nearby just made sense.  The open floor plan is nice and the decor is simple but modern and clean.  Did I notice that all of the waitresses were wearing yoga pants?  I did, and that isn't a bad thing.  I got the french dip + mushrooms and swiss and a coffee to help with my hangover.  The sweet potato fries could have standed to be crunchier, but the flavor was there and the sandwich was quite tasty.  Normally at a place with a name such as this I would only stick to breakfast - but when one is hung over, you must go with your gut instinct, and I'm glad I did.  Traffic / parking was a mess, but I suppose that's to be expected on a weekend with such beautiful weather.  Overall, I dig this place and will likely be back."}
{"text":"PREPARE TO WAIT!!!!  i'm not gonna lie-the service is great and the breakfast is really good too-i usually make my own omlett but have also had the salmon lox on a bagel w cream cheese, their yogurt and granola w berries, pancakes...Basically i've had a l lot of food there! haha.  The only thing is that it's never anything SUPER SPECIAL to have that kind of a wait.  Most of the time i drive by to see if it's packed or not-if i wanna go in, and 8/10 times its a line out the door.  

But i will say this-it's super consistent.  i've never had a bad order or anything like that and it is reasonably priced as well-so if you don't mind waiting for breakfast-give it a try!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing about breakfast food. There's not a lot of variety, so ideally, yours should be better than the next guy's. In this, Breakfast Club fails. 

Food isn't bad, but they've never made that 4oz. $8.00 \"Harris Ranch\" filet well. I've boiled steak in the UK that tastes just as good for half the price. 

Also, never have coffee here. Not at least their bar drinks. It's horrible, and the person taking your order will repeat it back to you to correctly three times, but you won't get the drink you ordered.

It's trendy little spot in the Old Town Scottsdale area, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great fun vibe at 9am on Sunday. 30 min wait, not bad. Coffee excellent. Food delicious, fresh, eggs cooked perfectly. Service was fast. 
We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Hardly any wait, and now I know why. We went a couple years ago when it first opened and had great food, but it has really gone downhill.

THE FOOD: Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits are listed as jalapeno, but there was no jalapeno flavor at all. The gravy was decent. The roasted potatoes were not cooked enough and were too raw to cut with a fork.

The Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.

Belgian waffle. Decent. It's kind of hard to screw up a waffle. 

SERVICE: The service was good. Attentive without being annoying.

It is definitely a place where the annoying of Scottsdale seem to flock to. I was expecting to see cameras come in to film an episode of Real Housewives of Scottsdale.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I think they made me a 23-egg omelet. It was honestly enough for four people, but it was delicious so I may have eaten two peoples' shares. I customized my own with spinach and mushrooms, and the innards were cooked perfectly. The omelet could have been fluffier, but I imagine it take some time to flip an omelet that weighs 2 lbs. I also had some biscuits which were covered in some of the richest gravy I have ever eaten. I didn't touch the potatoes on the side because I was too full from eating everything else.

The best part of the this restaurant, in my opinion, is the coffee bar that is attached to the restaurant, but accessible through a side door. This really helps with the early morning wait. Simply ingenious."}
{"text":"I would literally fly across the country every day to have breakfast here if I could; yes it's that good. Service is efficient and the restaurant is in a great location too."}
{"text":"When a friend called on Saturday morning asking if I wanted to go to brunch, I suggested The Breakfast Club in Old Town since I had been wanting to go there for some time. I'm really glad I suggested it because it was delicious. I arrived around 1 pm (they close at 3 pm) on a gorgeous Saturday, so I wasn't upset when I was told I couldn't be seated until my dining companion joined me. There are chairs outside to sit in while you wait and it was so nice out, I relished the opportunity to bask in the sunshine. When I mentioned my friend had just arrived and was parking her car, the hostess sat me in a cozy booth inside. Definitely make sure everyone in your party is there so you can be seated right away. Our waitress was really nice and helpful and paid just the right amount of attention to us.

I do wish The Breakfast Club had alcohol because a mimosa on a sunny Saturday would have made the day perfect, but alas they do not have alcohol. My friend enjoyed her green iced tea and my black hot tea was fine. My friend had the Nutty Belgian Waffle (she added berries on the recommendation of our waitress), which filled the entire plate and looked quite yummy. I had the four cheese omelet which was divine! None of the four cheeses overpowered the other and when I cut into the omelet, the cheeses were hot and gooey...yum! The potatoes and peppers that came on the side were good and I left feeling contently full.

For our two drinks, two entrees, and a side of bacon, our bill came to $30 before tip which I thought was very reasonable for a breakfast establishment. I can't wait to go back to try some more items, although hopefully next time I can score a table on the patio."}

The Breakfast Club was a cult classic in the 80's.  The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale does not disappoint.  Though not so much a classic yet, they do serve a mean breakfast - Yum! 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast.  Eggs Benedict Arnold - haha! (Peter Griffin from Family Guy).  Needless to say I loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions.  (Enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm).  Like going back in time, back to the 80's, where breakfast was a time to stuff your face!  My eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham.  Not too overpowering and just the right sweetness.  I had my hash extra crispy and my bacon; I like them soft and chewy.  I added some hot sauce and I had myself a grand meal.

The place itself had a business diner yet modern feel.  Not your typical dive diner for sure!  Service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There is pretty much always a wait on the weekends. It's a very popular spot, and for good reason. The food is great, the atmosphere is nice and the service is swift. 

I like how light and airy the room feels, everything is white and spacious so even though it's 3,000 degrees outside, it feels cool inside. The service was a little cold, and at times we weren't really sure which girl was assigned to our table, but everything worked out so it wasn't that bad. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"YUM.
Packed.
Service... is okay. 

Coffee is great! Love the sugar selection [hate Splenda in coffee.. love Stevia in coffee!]. I ordered the turkey/boursin omelette and it was SO GOOD. I couldn't get over it. 

Fast service but I don't recall anything special. In fact I do remember our waitress being pretty short with us but at least she did it with a smile!

I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My first time in Scottsdale, so i looked on yelp for some assistance. Heads up this is a VERY POPULAR spot to eat.  If you want a quite one on one with someone this is not the place for you. 

The food was very good and and prices are appropriate. The only downside was that the service was average at best."}
{"text":"Bananas Foster waffle here is mind-blowing.  Where else does your breakfast come with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?  A side of bacon makes this meal worth waking up for in the morning."}
{"text":"The reviews say it all! You want mouth watering breakfast?? go here! I can't see why anyone could be disappointed, the options on the menu were appetizing and the service was good! If you can't decide between an omelet and the waffles? my rule of thumb is split the goodies with a friend! or make one in line ;)

Yumminess!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always get the Bird omelet. It's a little pricey but the fact they are always consistent with quality and taste. It's worth it.  It's very popular so plan on a bit of a wait on the weekends.  But now that it's cooking off the patio is great to sit at"}
{"text":"The banana fosters pancakes are a decadent dessert for breakfast.

When we travel we like to spoil ourselves and go out to breakfast.  The Breakfast Club is a fun place with an 80s vibe.  It has outdoor seating and is dog friendly.  Which is one of the main reasons why we go because our little pup can join us.  

There's an extensive breakfast menu and full coffee bar to choose from.

My husband had the huevos ranchero, which he loved.  The Banana Fosters Pancakes were good - but you have to be in the mood for sweet and indulgent.  It's topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I have also had the Challah French Toast. It was too sweet and rich for me but I know it's would be a favorite amongst the kids.  It's a place that we'll revisit again."}
{"text":"Great, quick breakfast two days in a row.  Sat at the bar on a Tues and Wed back-to-back for a great experience both times.  The staff was attentive, the Quick Start was great with perfectly prepared eggs and bacon.  Nice TVs with morning news and markets. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not too thrilled to sit at a table for 15 minutes without any service, then hear two servers arguing whether or not my table was one of theirs or not. Finally a server, Kate (not one of the two arguing servers), came up and took my order. Once I was ready for the bill though, and my plate had been taken by a busboy, I waited another 15 minutes just to get the bill. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Wait was about 15 minutes on Saturday @ noon. Grapefruit juice was delightful, everything we order was consistently good - filet mignon bene , French toast , over medium eggs, hash browns & bacon... Service was nice and friendly, place have a great vibe and seating is very spacious between other tables. My Only disappointment was their advertised ice coffee, it's flavored with Carmel and hazelnut syrup - at the first sip it tasted really watered down... But figured let's not complain before we get our food.. Food was good, it leveled out my need to complain"}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast with solid customer service. But the best part was the reservation system integrated within yelp. Getting in line before I got there made a real difference in my overall experience.  

The food was delicious and server was incredibly responsive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Said our wait would be 20-30 min but ended up being like 8 minutes. Definitely come by, the eggs Benedict and breakfast burrito were bomb."}
{"text":"this review is basically for the management staff that was there this morning. we usually gontonthe downtown phoenix location and have never had an issue. today we drove to scottsdale specifically to go here. first off parking is horrible so be prepared. wait time was 25 min, not to bad especially it took that long to find a place to park. we were seated on the patio the server was friendly and prompt to come get drink order. then came lady who didn't announce who she was and asked if we were still in complete since there was an open chair. I stated no we are all her and my 2 yr old was standing beside me at the table. she again stated well if your incomplete you will have to get up and wait till your party is complete. I again stated we are a family of 4 we are all here and have already ordered our beverages. with a soul on her face and a raised tobe she stated I didn't need to be so rude she was just doing her job. no apology for the misunderstanding or anything. I asu med ahe was a hostess and stated as she stormed off I would like to speak with the manager. she then turned and shouted I am the manager. our nice waitress came and she apologizes and stated there is a second manager I could speak with, again a lady came to our table and just stood there. didnt address us, tell us who she was, or even an apology for the previous misunderstanding. soni expressed to her what happened and she just dismissed it and stated the other person told her that she didn't tell us we would have to leave and wait. I asked for general manager and was told she would not give that info to me either but I could leave my info which we all know what happen to that...I will not gontonthe location again that being said the food is good and service is outstanding but dont get up off your seat or they get very upset. I will patron the downtown location from now on."}
{"text":"I came in from NYC this weekend to experience Scottsdale and was taken to The Breakfast Club by a friend who lives in the area. I can honestly say much of my experience here can be best summed up by the word / sound \"Meh\" 

I was quoted a wait time of around 10 mins but it ended up being closed to 30 mins. The waitress was ok but not overly attentive. The coffee was alright. I ordered the Huevos rancheros which was actually pretty good. I order this dish whenever I can and this was a great authentic green chili version. I thought the pork was top notch but the egg was entirely too small for the size of the dish. Having enough egg to add to every bite is what makes the dish perfection and this fell a bit short.

All and all I think you can easilly get a better breakfast at over easy but it's not in downtown scottsdale. The location was very cool and gave me a nice feel for the city. Bottom-line not the worst place to get breakfast but you could do better."}
{"text":"We came upon this place accidentally through yelp....and are sooo happy we did.

While there seems to always be a long wait....20-30 minutes both mornings we came, it is worth it.  Though I'd have to say that our first experience was WAY BETTER than our second, though it was extraordinarily busy that second time. 

As a first timer I was overwhelmed with my delicious choices.... though my husband quickly narrowed my options claiming that one of us was going to get the french toast and the other the omelet.  Being that I'm more of a savory than sweet person, I picked an omelet--within his \"no red meat or pork limitations\" in mind.  I opted for the Bird:  turkey, mushroom, and boursin cheese with sliced avocado on top.  

When breakfast came, we were beyond drooling and ready for our feast.  I immediately smeared a little cream cheese on my everything toasted bagel and took a bite...not a new york bagel, but this is az.  Then I turned my attention to the omelet....overfilled with freshly shaved thick cuts of moist turkey!!! I almost didn't want to share, but luckily it was big enough, and with the bagel and all ;)   Next to the omelet were their O'Brien potatoes...omg, the tri-colored roasted peppers sauteed with the potatoes were full of fresh bright flavors; these I refused to share!  There were also three or four big hunks of fruit on the plate, though I never got to the healthy stuff.

My husband, as promised, ordered the Cinnamon Challah French toast.  He enjoyed it, though I found the thickness of the bread to be lacking completely.  Being a Jew from New York, I have partaken in many a Challah french toasts and the thickness is of vital importance...1 1/2 to 2\" thick is perfect...you get the soft, eggy fluffiness of the center and the crispy buttery crunch on the outside....with a thin cut peice of challah...your missing the eggy fluffiness, and it sometimes just gets limp under the syrup; which it did.  The candied nuts and fruit, however, make up a little bit for that limpness, as it added texture!

Overall, we felt we would return, and even did the next day.  And while the service and food were not as good as the first time; ~~when is it ever?  We'd still return!"}
{"text":"Ok, so....my husband and I go here almost EVERY weekend, so I think it's time for a review. Not really much to say other than this place is great. Hubby always gets strawberry banana pancakes or bananas foster french toast. I always get the oatmeal with the BC Burro or one of their breakfast sandwiches. Either way, I have ordered other items too, they always seem to satisfy no matter what. 

Tips:call ahead to get your name on the list-it used to be no more than 10 minutes, now it's 45, because no matter what there is a wait. We live in chandler, so when we call it's usually when we are exiting because parking is sometimes a pain too. But we've learned a few tricks to get around since we go so much. 

Again, no matter what you order it's great, lots of food and the OJ is fresh squeezed. Prices aren't bad either-BC Burro is $5, and it's pretty fatty-in a good way. 

That is all-happy eating folks!"}
{"text":"Great value, delicious food, excellent and quick service. 5 stars in my book!! The restaurant is also very clean, and the atmosphere is bright and welcoming.we enjoyed it so much we went 3 times during our visit to Phoenix. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about the Breakfast Club, I have now eaten here a couple of times and can't quite grasp what everyone enjoys so much. The food is decent, but not worth the price you are paying. Also is crowded and noisy, especially on the patio which is right next to Scottsdale Road. The food will satisfy, but doesn't really go above and beyond or will make you want to continue to go back."}
{"text":"First, they have a dog friendly patio!  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  We ate here  two mornings, and enjoyed both meals. One of the best eggs Benedicts I've had in a long time and the fruit was exceptional."}
{"text":"Love this place! aside from the wait on the weekends, we had an amazing meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good and plentiful.  Had breakfast burrito with green chili sauce - pretty darn good.  The wait and seating is a crapshoot as some that came after got seated before us."}
{"text":"Seeing that my last Breakfast Club review was in February 2009, it's definitely time for an update... since then, I've dined at this restaurant (both for breakfast and lunch) quite a few times.  I have one friend that eats here several times a week and swears by it.  They recently did a renovation and have a ton more space, hence less wait time on busy mornings.  It looks awesome - they have a great counter space, juice bar, brick wall, comfy booths and tables, and bigger bathrooms too.

You still get the same variety and quality of menu items since the renovation, but I'm pretty sure their prices went up a bit.  I find almost everything to be moderately priced, but I ordered a large grapefruit juice today without looking at prices and my friend told me that they charged $7 for it.  $7 for a large juice?  Are you kidding?  That's a bit much... even if it was freshly squeezed!

A few of my faves on the menu: the fresh start conscious, the oatmeal, the turkey wrap sandwich, and the berry/goat cheese salad.  Servings are large, service is always pretty attentive, and they are fine with substitutions... another perk for me is the location; it's super close to both my home and office making it extremely convenient for breakfast (and lunch) meetings.  Just watch out for the juice prices if you go!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast brunch place. Affordable and the portions are generous. Staff very friendly. Wait time about 40min on a Sunday noon. Very satisfied, will return. I had the Traditional Benedict very tasty with a side of bacon."}
{"text":"Not too bad, my mom friends and I came here for breakfast and had to wait over half an hour for a table (I understand we have four babies total but come on, they wouldn't even let us push two tables together outside). The food was ok priced and pretty good, but their menu was pretty small. The waitress was really nice and we all left full, but I will probable never come here again...just ok."}
{"text":"Hardy breakfast. I get the quick start loaded but sub the breakfast potatoes for hash browns- a side of avocado really takes your breakfast to the next level. Ask for hot sauce. You think I'm full? I'm not. Get a waffle on the side to share with the table. It's literally the best tasting waffle I've ever had. And I've had a lot of waffles. Add strawberries, you won't be sorry. Beverages: tea is good (I'm a ice tea drinker so I know) mimosa is better. Fresh OJ. Average Scottsdale prices. Everything I just mentioned minus the mimosa and splitting with waffle with one person was $24 including tip. Only negative is the inside is always loud on those mornings when your nursing a hang over and outside is a lil hot. They really need to work on that. Jk they can't control the climate."}
{"text":"Deplorable, is how I describe my experience at the Breakfast Club.

A friend and I dropped in after a hike on Camelback Mountain. We arrived at 2:40pm. We were aware that the restaurant would be closing at 3pm and already knew what we wanted to order. We were waiting at the front for a hostess and were not greeted for 3 minutes.  There was no one at the front. When the phone began ringing I was sure someone would come to the frnt but no one did!  In fact, three waitresses made eye contact with us then ignored us.  Finally, the bartender hollered over that we can sit anywhere we like and to seat ourselves.  We chose a table outside due to having a dog with us.  When our waitress arrived she was contemptuous.  

We ordered our food immediately after the waitress brought us water.  We also asked for a couple cups of coffee.  Before our food came out, our waitress came back to our table and informed us \"by the way they poured out the last pot of coffee so there is no more coffee\". We were perplexed that she wouldn't just brew another pot if we wanted another cup, which we did. When our food finally arrived half of the food was hot and the other was cold.  My potatoes were hot and appeared to have come right off the stove however my eggs were cold.  How was it possible that my eggs were just made but became cold so quickly? We asked for a manager to explain what I have written above. The manager was very nice and apologetic and offered to remake our plates. 

After receiving our remade plates, we noticed the waitress's and busser began closing up shop. While we were still eating, our waitress asked if she could take any plates away and if we needed our sugar packets any longer... Our plates weren't even half eaten. I was so appalled that she was trying to take away anything she could from our table that I considered asking her if she \"needed to collect our silverware to put in the dishwasher leaving us to use our hands?\" We paused before we replied that we were not done with the sugar. Soon after the bus boy began turning off the space heaters, including the one at our table. We had to finish our food in the cold. I was quickly beginning to feel like a second class citizen. There were a couple of parties still finishing up their food inside when the waitresses were placing the chairs on top of the tables in preparation for closing. I'm sure particles of dust and dirt were swept into the air and landing on their food. At the very least, I was comforted that we weren't the only ones receiving bad service, as weird as that sounds.  

In the end, the manager comped our meal and we left most of it on our plate after being freezed out and our waitress chomping at the bit to take our plates away. Her behavior was more clamorous than our dog who was hoping we would drop crumbs that she could gobble. Needless to say, our experience was regrettable. We expected very different from a restaurant in Old Town with a modern open feel and large bar.  I frequently see lines out the door for the restaurant and it looked like a happening place. My advice is if you are going to dine here be sure you will be finished with all your food before 2:40pm otherwise your service will quickly dissolve.  I'm still wandering if they gave me eggs off of someone else's plate which would explain why they were cold. If the Breakfast Club does not want to serve until 3pm as their hours state they should close their kitchen earlier or close the restaurant earlier.  They certainly should not have asked us to have a seat and treat us as if it was an imposition."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here this morning. I realize it is Easter and the wait would be long so I was willing to wait. Upon arrival I was told 35 minutes for a party of two. We grabbed some coffee, from the barista who was rude,and waited for 55 minutes. When we got called for our table they sat us at a large table on one side and we expected that another party would sit on the other side. The hostess put a large party on the other side of the table so there was not even one chair in between us and we were uncomfortably next to them. And to top it off, the waitress ignored us and went to them first not even acknowledging us. Thank you for the complete waste of time."}
{"text":"This is a top-notch place to stop for breakfast or lunch. Their breakfast menu is huge and their food is absolutely great. The wait staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great and has the option for outdoor seating. Prices here are very reasonable. They even use real maple syrup instead of fake stuff. That was awesome."}
{"text":"Decent food but horrible owner.
I ordered a Diet coke.
\"We don't serve diet coke, the owner doesn't believe in it\"

Doesn't believe it in?
Diet soda is not the fricking Easter Bunny
Diet soda is not the Lock Ness Monster.
Is is a GD soft drink!!

\"Why not?\" I ask.
\"The owner hates fake sugar and refuses to support it\" Says the server

\" What about all this fake sugar on the table for our coffee? Every table has a bowl of sweetener on the table?!?!!\" says me.

\"Oh, that is for the coffee. He says it would upset too many people if we took it away. But you can go next door, and buy a diet there, then bring it over here if you like\"

WTF?!?!
Sure I'll go over there, next door every time I want a refill

So this guy takes his stand with diet soda?
Does he have any clue what is in regular soda?!?! Hell, diet or anything else, it is all bad for you. But I want a diet and the owner won't serve it

Way to take a stance on such an important issue genius..

Never again will I support this restaurant..
Lame"}
{"text":"What an awesome find. An old friend suggested we meet here for breakfast this morning. Walked in at 8:30 and was told there'd be a 15-20 minute wait for a table. That's a good sign...that people like the place...

Instead, I camped out at the breakfast bar and waited for my friend. In the meantime, I ordered a BC Coffee...which is iced coffee with Hazelnut and Caramel syrup...mine with Almond milk. It was great.

Once my friend arrived, we ordered. He ordered something massive and great looking. I ordered the \"Grilled Cheese\"...a total euphemism since it includes bacon, hash browns and eggs in addition to cheese on sourdough. Our server suggested I add avocado and tomato to it...which I did. Simply awesome. 

Our server, Victoria (a/k/a 'Barista1') was awesome as well. She was attentive and proactive. Never had to ask for a refill on my water. Table service showed up unasked for. And great positive energy.

Huge portions. Great coffee. Fantastic food. And supreme service with a smile. Definitely a \"go-to!\""}
{"text":"My first visit to the Breakfast Club was great! The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. Definitely going again in the near future. If you're a health freak like I am I highly recommend the Lean & Green Omelette!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a weekend trip to spring training. The food was wonderful and I especially enjoyed the fresh fruit that accompanies each dish.

I had the chorizo breakfast burrito which I recommend highly. We waited on a Saturday morning for about an hour so don't expect to just show up and get a table. Be prepared to wait but in my opinion it's worth it."}
{"text":"Every time I drive by this place it is packed, and I mean packed. Early Saturday morning though they didn't appear too busy so we decided to stop in for breakfast. I got the BC Sandwich and was not very impressed by it, not to mention the sandwich was served in a full entree plate making it look very small. They had good juice that was freshly squeezed and the servers were all nice. I also tried the breakfast grilled cheese and thought it was average, especially since the only difference between that and a regular grilled cheese was the egg and a piece of bacon. Maybe the crowd is there for the mimosas..."}
{"text":"Very good food. Excellent service. So nice to find a restaurant with great service these days. The staff hustled and paid close attention to their tables."}
{"text":"Fav place to eat breakfast, got to try it! I have been all over old town Scottsdale to eat and there are some truly amazing place, in my opinion Breakfast Club is absolutely the best! Get the app to cut the wait for a table! My wife and I have walk here each morning for 5 consecutive days to eat, there is that many truly great choices here. Go to's are huevos con masa, and the breakfast grilled cheese. All the servers are extremely friendly and joyful to have you order off menu.... And they get it right!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for breakfast. 

Food is fresh and tasty. Service is excellent. Decor is bright and airy. Ideal for a breakfast business meeting or setting a family up for a day out."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot.  Our waitress was very pleasant and provided quick and friendly service.  The food was also very good.  We sat outside on the patio under the cool mist and had an enjoyable time.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to after experiencing how rude the staff was on multiple occasions. I have lived in AZ my whole life and have eaten at the Breakfast Club pretty regularly. The past three times I have been the staff was extremely rude. After this last time, we decided we will no longer be eating at the Breakfast Club anymore, especially considering there are many other great breakfast places with pleasant staff."}
{"text":"After wandering around Saturday morning trying to get a feel for the city, my boyfriend and I made it over to the breakfast spot he'd been raving about all week.  The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly.  I decided to order the omelet with crab.  I'm usually very cautious about doing so in places that are not near the water (I'm from Baltimore after all) and it was surprisingly good and as was the fruit and potatoes.  My boyfriend who is self described as a tea snob loved that our looseleaf tea was served in a metal tea pot, which I seriously considered taking with us because it was so cool.  

On the downside, we did feel a little out of place given we had so many curious stares from customers, but I'll chalk it up to us being clearly not from around here.  

I'd definitely recommend this place to others and would probably visit every so often if I lived here.  I do really love the healthy options on menu and will plan to give it a try again."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the door, I felt a little unwelcome. The hostess, I felt was a little lazy. She asked me to choose my own table, maybe because it was a little slow, that part I understand. But I feel like you should put more enthusiasm when greeting customers walking to the door. 

The food was ok. I got the turkey and eggs. A lil bland for me. The waitress was a lil stern but I guess that's just how she is because she checked on me periodically like she was supposed to. Idk, I might give this another chance."}
{"text":"When you're looking for a big breakfast or brunch to devour in the Old Town Scottsdale neighborhood, this is one club you'll want to belong to. Now, although you don't have to actually own a membership to this club, you may feel like you need to belong to some of Scottsdale's \"downtown elite\" to visit this joint.

If you're looking for good breakfast food - hearty omelets with fruit and potatoes or wonderfully aromatic pancakes - then this place is for you. They have a great menu of plates, and you can tell that people line up for the flavor. I've had several omelets of theirs, with my most recent dish being overeasy huevos with a salsa-style ranchero sauce over jalapeno cornbread. It was delicious albeit heavy because of the cornbread - a truly savory Southwestern dish. 

The Breakfast Club is usually filled with a mix of Scottsdale residents, hungover ASU students, and out-of-place-out-of-towners. But the majority is Scottsdale's old town elite - which include the entitled teens and young \"adults\" of the city. It's an interesting spot to go people watching at, because you get to see some diversity and laid back attitudes amidst the pretentiousness of Scottsdale.

I actually would have given this place a fifth star if the hostess hadn't made a mistake on her seating list. My diner friend and I put our names on the list and went next door to the shops to kill time...30 minutes after our return (standing outside, right in front of the hostess), we asked if we would be seated anytime soon - because it had been 20 minutes past our quoted time, and we were told that we had been taken off the list. I guess the hostess assumed that our walking away meant that we wouldn't wait - but we never said that. So the beginning of our brunch was an annoying bummer...but I guess that's what you get when you're surrounded by a city of plastic and makeup instead of logic."}
{"text":"Perfect place to refuel after an evening in Old Town. The people watching is some of the best around. If you ever wondered what that hot girl/guy at the club looks like first thing in the morning, this is the place for you. 

Food is fantastic, especially the classic French toast. Give it a shot you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for something a little more complex than the standard eggs, pancakes and bacon combo, breakfast club should be at the top of your list."}
{"text":"We stopped into the Breakfast Club for a quick bite late morning and found it pretty delightful. It was early in the day and not too warm yet so the misters above us were a little uncomfortable, but bearable.  I'm guessing the locals like to feel cool as much as possible so we didn't say anything about it.  

I ordered their Breakfast Grilled Cheese made with hash browns, eggs, bacon, fontina & cheddar cheeses on grilled sourdough bread. It was decadent and quite yummy, but a bit too greasy. Nevertheless, it tasted great and was a large enough portion to share.  My latte was served in a nice glass mug and was made perfectly. The restaurant wasn't real busy at the time and our service was attentive.

All in all, a good meal and I'd venture back to try some other options. It's walking distance from several Old Town hotels so it's a good spot to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Regardless of what day of the week, this place gets BUSY.

We came here for some post-hike nourishment and the restaurant was already packed at 830AM on a Friday. The good news is that you can head to the counter and order lattes, juices, tea, etc to hold you over before you actually sit down to eat. That helped control the slight hanger pangs that were starting to come up.

After perusing tons of great options, I ultimately ended up with the breakfast grilled cheese. Two of my favorite things served as one combo, there was no way I was going to pass this one up. This cheesy concoction was loaded two kinds of ooey gooey goodness and included eggs, bacon and hash browns into the mix as well. I'd recommend it and would most definitely eat it again. Best choice after a big hike? Probably not - but I don't regret my gluttonous decision.

Service was prompt, and water glasses were refilled quickly. I can see why this is such a popping spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and well worth the wait.  Most entrees come with fruit and potatoes but you can select whatever sides you want.  My hubby opted for corn bread and pork green chile  (too salty for my taste) with his Portabello Eggs Benedict.  I had The Bird Omelet filled with turkey, fresh avocados, mushrooms, and a delicious sauce.  Can anyone say yummmmm!  Porions are abundant  and priced well.  All food was very fresh.  We will come again!"}
{"text":"Looking to grab a light lunch in Scottsdale so dropped in here......major disappointment!
Ordered eggs Benedict and a BLT with sweet potato fries 
The poached eggs were COLD...not room temp but refrigerator cold!
The sweet potato fries were not hot but closer to room temp.
Waitress offered to bring another eggs bene but didn't want to wait or bother so said no thanks but bring new fries 
The new fries were piping hot but they charged us for a side of fries!
Needless to say we'll never go back and neither should you!"}
{"text":"Too loud with the music and everyone talking. Eliminate the music it would be better couldn't even talk to my fiancé it was too loud to hear him. Music is awful for breakfast. Price is high on some items. No flavored cream for coffee."}
{"text":"Party of 7 -  all delighted with our individual choices for breakfast. Service was exemplary. Food was delicious. Price was reasonable. There was a 30 minute wait on a Sunday morning.  It was worth the wait. Various choices at our table included omelettes, pancakes, French toast, eggs over easy and country gravy over eggs on muffin Most breakfast choices came with delicious potatoes. No one had a complaint- except the portions were overwhelming . Coffee was great tasting. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The border bowl is so delicious.  Everything I've tried  here is delicious.  The atmosphere is cool and upbeat.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Really really good bloody Mary's along really good food and service.  Border Bowl with a fresh tortilla. The best!"}
{"text":"Well we tried this one out and the food was okay. If you like all the waitresses in yoga pamts then this is your place. We had a dirty knife and we actually had to point out to the waitress.  We asked for water no lemon and she brought my husband one with lemon. She said she thought we said no lemon comma??? Not sure about this. My husband did love the Burro Bowl. The price was okay."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant.  I use to live in the Phoenix area, but moved back to Las Vegas in 1996.  Me and my 2 girls just happen to be in town for the Taylor Swift concert.  

On our last day, and after checking out of our hotel down the street, we wanted to eat somewhere in the area.  After driving around a bit the night before, we chose The Breakfast Club as our dining choice the next morning.  We did not make a bad decision!!  Our visit was on August 19, 2015 at about 11:30 am.  We sat at table 44.

We arrived to the restaurant and was promptly greeted by the hostess.  I didn't catch her name, but she was very kind, asked how many in our party, and escorted us to our table which was located next to the window with a nice view of Scottsdale Road.  Big surprise there was no wait when we got there....Nice!!  Sitting at our table I glanced around the room and was very impressed how nice the restaurant is.  It's very open, inviting, properly lit, energetic, and not a single ugly person working in the front of house!  Don't get me wrong, I am all about enjoying the beauty in life, but this place takes it seriously.  The wait staff are all females (except for the bartenders) who wear either leggings or yoga pants, Nike tennis shoes, and the restaurant shirt and apron.  Even the male bartenders were attractive, which made me feel a bit inadequate!  Totally kidding!  Anyway, back to the review!  

A few minutes later we were greeted by our adorable waitress Shannon.  She was very polite, took our drink order (1 chocolate milk, and 2 lemonades) and even took the time to answer my silly questions about the restaurant.  Keep in mind I had two very tired teenagers with me, and Shannon was very patient, even though I know she had a busy section.  We placed our orders after asking about a few items on the menu.  The girls both chose the Banana French Toast, a side of bacon, and a side of 2 eggs.  I choose the Quick Start Breakfast which consisted of 4 eggs, potatoes O'Brian, a slice of 9 grain wheat, crispy bacon, and a fruit skewer.  I know...seems like a lot of food, and it was for the price of only $8.75.  That's a hell of a deal!!  Tasted amazing too!  Also, I tried the girls' French Toast and it was probably the best I have eaten in a long time.  Amazing quality goes into the presentation of their dishes!

Shannon came back regularly to check on us, offered necessary refills, and cleared soiled dishes when we were done with them.  This places deserves a higher rating than 5 stars, if it were possible.  Definitely coming back to eat again when I make it back to town!!  Great job again Shannon!  You are adorable!"}
{"text":"I'm really picky about breakfast.  This place was ok, not the best food in the world but not that either.  Fruit cup was large and flavorful.  The atmosphier is nice,  busy and upbeat.  However I did pay too much for a crappy cup of coffee.  Tasted very burnt."}
{"text":"When I worked in Scottsdale ate here all the time. Orange Juice is a little pricey but food was great and not expensive. If you wait and go later in the day it does get packed, but that is the sign of a good restaurant."}
{"text":"The best French toast I found in town on business. The only down fall is everyone loves this place if you don't get there early plan to wait for a spot. The service was great and the portions were awesome."}
{"text":"I was a sub contractor on the new breakfast club construction project for the owner in downtown Phoenix. The owner has refused to pay the General contractor the retention on this project. Every sub and small trade on this job is owned money by a greedy owner who is acting unethical. Until he does the right thing and pays the retention out on his new building so that all the people who worked hard on this project can get paid what is owed, maybe then we can afford breakfast. Please help us stand up for small business and think twice about giving your business to a man who hurts other small business by not paying them what he owes. God bless."}
{"text":"Very cool place to grab breakfast. We stayed nearby the W hotel and this was a nice 5 min walk. Had great food and great service. My advice, the breakfast sandwich or the burrito. Orrrrrrr the chocolate chip pancakes. They are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Its a bit crowded and loud but their grilled chicken is out of this world. Full of rosemary flavor without the crunch of it. Its excellent!"}
{"text":"Pompous owner/manager, this guy thinks he might be starting a new innovative trend for breakfast. What is really happening is distance and separation from valued customers. A member of a party can not join mid meal. People will be ignored and feel disowned if the  party is incomplete ( you will not be seated, and will feel punished for it). 
I feel nepotism is being used here; we were not spoken to once seated. I'm entitled to a nice welcome but was embarrassed by the lack of communication. 
The manager reminded us that we needed to finish up and start leaving, so he can seat more people; fuck you! I want to eat comfortably, I didn't order no food to go. If you wanted things to be like this you should throw the food in a blender and turn the whole place into a quick drive through.!

Couldn't see past the rudeness to actually taste what could have been a painless enjoying meal."}
{"text":"Meh. That's how I feel about this place after finally getting a chance to eat here. I feel like the wait is always super crazy so I was thinking it would be a bomb breakfast but honestly everything was just mediocre. Nothing was terrible but nothing was great either. Service was mediocre, food was mediocre. Mimosa was overpriced. 10 bucks? I'll pass. I could go somewhere else and get unlimited for 15. Overall, not impressed. I would go back if it was my only option but don't see this as being my first choice. I've had better breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on Saturday morning and we were very pleased with the meal and the service! I had the lox and bagels. The salmon was very fresh and there was enough to top both halves of the bagel. My boyfriend got the Huevos Rancheros and this was absolutely delish. The waitress recommended it and he was glad he ordered it. It was spicy and there was a TON of pork. The prices were pretty reasonable. I would definitely recommend checking this place out for breakfast, they have a lot of different options on the menu."}
{"text":"Big kudos for serving breakfast late in Scottsdale (unlike, ahem, the Orange Table, which stops the pancakes before 10 a.m.). But would I go back? Only for the pomegranate smoothie. 

Otherwise, it was pretty bland stuff. Ironically, the menu looks uber creative, but the execution? Not so much. Case in point: the ballyhooed cinnamon challah french toast was dried out and had no custardy center at all, plus the side of scrambled eggs was also extremely dry. 

Servers were OK, though seemed very not thrilled to be there. In the end, that's a fair attitude, I guess, since neither were we."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from Indiana and always gets biscuits and sausage gravy, which I had never even heard of before meeting him and am still kind of grossed out by. However, Breakfast Club's take on it (jalapeno, large chunks of real sausage instead of the bottom of the barrel gritty bits that it's usually made of) was actually good.  

I had a standard 2 eggs and toast and it was as good as I'd expect 2 eggs and toast to be.

The waitresses were all wearing yoga pants, which was kind of awesome - I'm jealous that I can't wear yoga pants to work!"}
{"text":"I ordered \"The Bird\" omelette. It came with 4 slices of fruit and potatoes with red and green peppers. It was excellent!! I also ordered a jalapeño cheddar biscuit. The biscuit was burnt on top. That's my only complaint. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ambiance is perfect!  Service was under 10 minutes on a Saturday morning!  Management was personable and took care of us! Thank you Stephen!"}
{"text":"Visiting for Spring Training we stopped in for breakfast. We only waited for about 15mins. 

While we waited I got a latte from the counter. It was pretty good. 

Sat down to eat and ordered an omelette with mushrooms, bacon and avocado, a side of potatoes and fruit. They definitely didn't skimp on the avocado like most places! It was delicious. The potatoes were browned with slices of red and green peppers. Also very good. 

The wait staff was very friendly from the time we walked in till the time we left. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends. If there were more breakfast choices around this area, TBC would be empty. 

I've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold, plus the order was messed up. 

The outdoor patio on the side street is nice but the Scottsdale Road side gets quite noisy with the traffic.

Wait staff and hostesses are nothing fabulous, not overly friendly considering the price and the wait. 

Maybe I should down a couple Malibu drinks before I come for breakfast and it would be a better experience."}
{"text":"Great Service. Food came out 5 minutes after we ordered in. Everything was tasty, but my husband really enjoyed his \"border bowl\"."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I must say it was a good one. I checked in via the Yelp app (A MUST DO) got there right when it was time to be seated. Ordered our food and we got our food within 15mins of ordering it. The food was great and the service was splendid. Specially with how busy it gets on a Saturday morning. Will go again!"}
{"text":"This place has the best French toast I have ever had in my life! Not to mention the hostess and all the waitresses are so friendly, even the ones that weren't serving us. Would totally recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast with friendly service and good prices."}
{"text":"Just ok brunch 
Ate here on a Friday late-morning. Surprisingly busy, big mix of people. A lot looked like they came from the gym..or just wearing workout clothes ;) 

SEATING:
They do have some counter/bar seating as well as a variety of other tables. It's not actually a large space and we did have to wait about 15mins (at 10:30am on a Friday). 
Annoyingly they have quite a few high top tables and stools when you first walk in for \"waiting only\". Seems like a waste of space, if they served at these tables there would be less waiting. 
They do have outdoor space with misters 

SERVICE: 
Pretty good

FOOD:
Again, good not great. I got the Huevos Ranchero - which was NOT Huevos Ranchero...it was a soft flour tortilla, lots of lettuce, no ranchero sauce. Super disappointing. The avocado was presented beautifully, the best part of the meal 
The menu has a lot of variety so would be good for a group

DRINKS: 
They have the brunch basics (mimosa, Bloody Mary, etc) I got one with grapefruit juice and vodka. It was huge and just ok 

PARKING:
There is parking out from and a parking garage"}
{"text":"The menu: wow!

If you want big helpings, fresh ingredients, and pleasant service this is your jam. Also, they have several tasty jams, we're told. Waking up on eastern time in the PDT landed us there at opening, and 30 mins later they were packed. I can't imagine the Saturday @ 930a wait. 

The breakfast bowl was piled high with pulled pork, could have upped the awesome with more veggies and cheese in the scramble, but it still wins. The Lean and Green omelette was a great choice, especially paired with the biscuits and gravy. We also ordered one slice of the French toast... Amazing.

Lastly, they have a really creative bar. The bloody was better than most, and the Salty Dog came with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice... so good you have to have two of them!"}
{"text":"We went for a late brunch last Sunday. We were told it would be a 45-minute wait turns out it was only 30 minutes. NICE. I was GLAD to see such a diverse crowd.  there is a bar in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables and booths. there is a glass window for the kitchen so if you are interested in seeing who's preparing your meal you can. Pro's 
  friendly staff 
good food 
large portions 
Con's 
the seating feels tight 
 the noise level was very loud price for our meal for 2 was $35 before tip
****we had no problem with the hostess or our server."}
{"text":"I've had decent experiences here in the past, though it always reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld where Elaine is complaining about all the waitresses at Monk's Diner looking the same. Today was pretty terrible. First of all, I ordered buckwheat pancakes, bacon, and hash browns. The butter for my pancakes had a hair in it. The bacon was good. The hash browns were the greasiest I'd ever seen. Just covered in oil. I've had better from Waffle House. I won't be back for quite a while."}
{"text":"AMAZING service (our server was Jayme, super sweet) and food came out hot and fast! prices are also affordable and not too long of a wait either. overall, great place for brunch in Scottsdale! would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of this place. I have been coming here on the weekends for the past 4 years and it never disappoints. Every time my parents come into to town they come eat here. They will drive down from north Scottsdale every morning for breakfast. Sometimes I end up going here back to back on Saturday and Sunday! Anytime I have someone visiting from out of town, this is where I take then for breakfast. Be prepared to wait on the weekends but it's well worth the wait. You can always grab a drink at the coffee bar while you are waiting. They move people in and out pretty quickly. 

The omelets are great (the Whole Hog being my favorite). The fresh fruit that's comes with the omelets is good. Omelets come with potatoes too, but I often substitute toast for the potatoes. The Lean and Green omelette is also a good option if you are trying to behave. I'll substitute turkey and broccoli for the fruit and potatoes if I'm trying to keep it healthy. 

The blueberry pancakes and the french toast are incredible. If you get the french toast, make sure to get the fresh fruit and nuts on top. It's a game changer! Even if I get an omelette, I can't help but order 1 pancake or 1 piece of french toast on the side, or both :) It's that good! 

I can't speak to any of the lunch menu items because the breakfast is that good! Maybe I'll try a lunch item one day, but not any time soon. If you are not in a rush and have some time to hang out, this is the perfect place for breakfast or brunch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Good service.. Clean place.. Good comes out quick. We had the border bowl, bc French toast and breakfast grilled sandwich. All were very good. My fave was the French toast it had blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, candy walnuts, almonds and powdered sugar on top. The bread was light and fluffy with a hint of cinnamon. If your a French toast lover I recommend trying it:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic way to start the day: the coffee and the food are excellent as is the location. Grab an early breakfast then a nice walk around Old Town to start off a great day!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a weekday.  They have sidewalk tables outside as well as indoor dining.  Our server gave us good service.  She kept checking our levels if coffee in our cups.  Our food cane to the table quickly.  My husband had a type of Mexican breakfast bowl with a blend of potatoes, eggs, shredded meat with cheese.  He loved it.  I had a egg white dish with yummy veggies and potatoes.  The plate portions were generous.  Great way to start our morning with a happy tummy."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! The French Toast is my favorite. The wait time is worth it!"}
{"text":"I go to BC almost every morning and have probably been there 100 times.  It a nice place with a great staff and good food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not spectacular.  At 10:00am on a weekday, I'm not sure if it's worth the 25 minutes wait.  They do have alcoholic breakfast drinks.  So if you want a mimosa, head down there."}
{"text":"We came here one morning because we had to drop my mom off in Scottsdale.
We decided to sit at the bar.(even though we're nondrinkers)
My fiancé order the steak and eggs. He said everything was good. And actually made his steak the way he likes it.
I ordered the French toast. So nice 3 huge slices I loved that it didn't come with all the extra stuff like eggs bacon .. just a side of fresh fruit. It was so yummy.. our waitress didn't bring the maple syrup. I had to ask another server to bring it over.
So the only down side here is the service it seems they are so busy having their own conversations and not really paying that much attention to the customer.
Im sure we Probably come back bc the food was super yummy ...we can get over the service for some bomb breakfast."}
{"text":"Great experience, used the Join wait list from yelp and it worked. The hostess was friendly upon arrival and directed us to where we could order very good coffee at the counter. We were seated in few minutes and the server was very a professional. The food was very good. The blue corn meal pancake was the superb. The omelet  we ordered came with a spear of fresh fruit which were well portioned slices of pineapple, honey dew and cantaloupe. The potatoes were sautéed in peppers and onions with just enough oil. We loved our server and gave her 25% tip. This  was a five star breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is such a good brunch spot. They have so many unique twists on classic breakfast faves. I got eggs over this jalepeno cornbread with chorizo sauce and it's honestly a breakfast I think about weekly. I can't wait to go back and have it again or try something else on the menu because it all looks so good. Portions are great and it's a cool little restaurant. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"So visiting Phoenix and wanted to give this place a try.  Tough review - the food was good, but the service wasn't. 

We were sitting outside and our waitress rarely came outside. Never had the chance to ask for some sugar for my espresso. Didn't get the chance to ask for salt with my eggs. And my husband only had 1 coffee refill, but he did say the coffee was good. 

It was mid-morning and wasn't crowded, so there was really no excuse. It's a shame because we would have gone back there for the food. My husband really liked the southwestern egg convention that he got the was served on a tortilla."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing breakfast place so much variety! Love the vibes lots of people and energy yet casual and fun. Enjoyed sitting at the bar if you don't want to wait for a table. 

We loved the huevos con masa, the cornbread was delicious. The French toast was some of the best I have ever had! Panacake was good but French toast much better. Orange juice was a little bitter maybe due to season."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this because I've been here so many times and never a fan of writing negative reviews but here is what happened on my last visit. We knew it would be a long wait so we put our name in and gladly waited. When they sent us the text that our table was ready the girl at the counter asked if everyone in our party was here. I said yes and that my wife was parking the car and getting the baby out. All she said was \"Ok\". 25 minuets later we were still waiting and even though my wife had been there with us for a while we weren't being seated.  I was watching party after party come in and get seated before us so I asked when we we would be seated and the hostess seemed really annoyed with me. She told me she couldn't seat everyone until our entire party was there. I wish I would have known!  I certainly don't want to be an annoying customer but when she said \"ok\" the first time I had the impression we were going to be seated."}
{"text":"Very well thought out concept, food was good but whatever I ordered was hot. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Breakfast simply doesn't get better than this.  Nice place, great coffee, and their steak and eggs is the best in the Valley.  I've never needed more than my fork to cut my steak.  They have a few different 'benedicts' each of which will take you to a culinary place you'll be glad you visited.  Did I mention how good the coffee is ?      Seriously."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating here it is a bit pricey but the food was very good!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this afternoon (Saturday around 12) and was very pleased with my experience!!
Michelle was our server and she was great! Very attentive, without being annoying. From past experiences, that's hard to completely accomplish so I was very pleased!
My boyfriend and I barely had to wait ten minutes for a table...on a Saturday!! We're in Old Town Scottsdale so it's totally understandable to wait for a table at a delicious restaurant (which I don't think people around here understand).
I created my own omelet, and it was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito and he loved it. We are foodies...especially me with breakfast food so I couldn't make a decision so we also ordered French toast and loved it too!!
Cute place with a very friendly staff definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We were there at opening. Nothing like 72 degrees, all the doors open, and the scent of freshed squeezed orange juice wafting through the restaurant!  The food was great, fresh, and reasonably priced. Great location right in Scottsdale.  Get the orange juice!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a good place to have brunch and we heard nothing but good things about The Breakfast Club. Service was fantastic and I ordered the Mushroom Eggs Benedict which was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here with five of my girlfriends for our girls weekend. In short I had the best omelette of my life. Got the tuscan omelette and added bacon. Our food was out in literally five minutes after we ordered it. Fresh squeezed OJ and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Wednesday at 11. The wait was about 5 minutes for a table. I dont know if the waitress profiled me, but the guy at the table next to me received much faster service even though we were seated around the same time. The food came out super fast and tasted great! I got a mimosa, a pancake, and an omelette that had turnkey and avocado in it. I don't remember what it was called. The prices were fair. Overall I liked the place. Giving 4 stars for service."}
{"text":"Great French toast... Topped with fresh berries and Carmelites nuts' served with warm maple syrup! If your mouth is not watering by now... The bacon is so thick and crispy, the coffee was like crack... Super great place, the area truant just got renovated so seating and the wait was great!"}
{"text":"my favorite breakfast in Scottsdale on our trip! there is always one on every trip we have and this one was it for me. I had the four cheese omelet that was heavenly! just omg. I still think about that just mmmm. if we came back to Scottsdale this would be the first place to hit up."}
{"text":"First time here. I had finished hiking Camelback Mountain and this place came up with a good amount of reviews. I used the yelp app to add myself to the waitlist. I arrived and it was an additional 45 min wait from the time I put myself on the list. Therefore get there any time before 9 am. The wait time went by pretty quick. The best thing about this place was their service once your seated. Our waitress attended my sister and I very quick. I order the lean & green omelette with turkey sausage. Overall it's was decent. It had a ton of veggies which I enjoyed. Portion size was good. Came with potatoes and fruit. The fruit addition was different but I really enjoyed it. Overall it was a 3 for me I felt like the food could have been a little bit better in regards to my omelette. But I would recommend this place so that you can try it out for yourself and make your own decision. Some reviews were iffy but you really don't know until you come here for yourself."}
{"text":"Seriously this place rocks! If your in Scottsdale definitely go to this breakfast place. Love the food, servers, interiors and the awesome music! Tip: call in advance to have your name on the wait list instead of waiting there for 1 hour. Try the loco moco waffles but pretty much everything here is delish! The hostess there named Carly is sooo nice and it just lifts your mood amidst the crowd that's there."}
{"text":"This is a really good breakfast joint. The eggs are good, bacon is great and fresh squeezed juices rock!

Tried a Mimosa and they were bitter. We told the waitress and she took them off the bill. We are coming back every day so you know the food is good."}
{"text":"breakfast is amazing!! would've given then a 5 if they had better service."}
{"text":"Those big tables are great but you should never sit a party of adults at the same table as a party with children at the same table. If your three hostess have time to stare at me they have time to get me a water.

Thanks for Nothing, we went to MS Awsome service."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast on a recent Saturday morning. Ate at bar. Food, service, and price all good. Nice ambience. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast Club is a staple in every trip I make out to Scottsdale. I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Their portions are big, their prices are not bad for a trendy brunch restaurant, and their staff is friendly. 

A few of my favorites: 
*The Bird omelet: I don't get the cheese or mushrooms, you don't need it since the avocado makes it really creamy 
*Turkey Benedict: a fun twist, and their turkey is like Thanksgiving turkey...delicious 
*Jalapeno Biscuits & Sausage Gravy: a little kick and ends up solidifying in your stomach...in a good way 
*Breakfast Burrito: PLEASE try it with the chorizo queso on top...it might have changed my life 
*Bagel & Lox: really fresh and just the right amount of salty 

Things I don't love (and there are just a few): 
*The wait can be a biatch, especially if it's really hot outside (there are only so many shaded areas to stand) 
*The coffee bar is nice because you don't have to wait until seated to get a caffeine fix, however the wait is long, the space is cramped, and it's pricey 
*Their Potatoes O'Brien are delicious but have way more bell peppers than actual potatoes, and it's a pretty small serving 
*The crowd can be a bit obnoxious, but it's part of the fun of the whole experience...it's fun to judge others over a yummy brunch"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot! Try the Bloody Mary it was absolutely delicious! Food was great and service was good. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised that this restaurant (that I had been told to try by lots of people) was only very average. It was a long wait (which was normal I guess) but the hostesses were not very nice and neither was our waitress. All of the staff seemed a little stuck up. The breakfast menu was pretty standard and a little overpriced. The biscuits and gravy were $11 and it was not big at all. Usually for that amount of b&g it's only $7/8 at other places. All of the food my  table got was only luke warm, which was a major downer.  Also, it was NFL Sunday and they had a good amount of tvs inside. Only problem was, there were two games on tv and they had infomercials and news on every tv except one. It just seems like this place could be better if they did some things different and tried to be better then average."}
{"text":"Always the same great food and service!!  So friendly to our dog!!  Love it, it's a sun morning staple for us!"}
{"text":"SO good. If you have ever driven by here, pretty much any day in the morning, you can see that there's a huge line. You can mark your place in line on the Yelp app, so that helps to eliminate waiting outside for a while. The food here is so good. I got the turkey wrap & my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich. Everything was amazing. The mimosas are also super good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is really tasty and delicious. One of the reasons why i love this place is the gravy is sooo good I ordered biscuits gravy and it was so fabulous. Actually we ordered mocha and it was so goood. 
I absolutely will come there again."}
{"text":"Have to stop by this place if you're looking for some good breakfast.  I ordered the BC French Toast and my wife had one of their Benedict's.  There was a good amount of food and we both basically inhaled what was on our plate.  Our server was also pretty awesome which added to the experience."}
{"text":"My coworkers and me chose this place for breakfast 3 morning while we were in town for work. At first it seems like a nice place with a good vibe. 
FOOD: Decent, nothing out of the ordinary. Good breakfast, fresh, nothing fancy or authentic. Deserves 3.5 stars. 
STAFF: mixed feelings. Waiters were all nice and fast. But I truly hope management is reading this about the greeting staff: the girls at checkin are rude and very inconsistent. Day 1: First of all they told us 20 minutes, we said that's too long for us, so she said \"ok first available I could seat you know\"....ok what did she think we want? 2nd or 3rd available?
Day2: 20 minute wait (first available lol), we waited 40, complained and got a very rude reply, a very dishonest apology, no smile, telling us about their policies. 
Day3: 30 minute wait, ok, we wait 45, ask what's going on, again rude reply, no apology. She said 15 more minutes, 1 minute later we got seated. 

I do get its hard to manage the flow in a restaurant accurate. A bit more friendliness would go a very very long way. 
I'd rate this place a bit higher, not much wrong with it, but who wants to start his morning like this? Fails the purpose. A smile and a sincere apology would've been nice."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  Good food.  Good service.  Good prices.  Quality food .

Patio seating for when the weather is nice.

Try the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Love the vibe and service at the counter with Jamie was excellent.  She was friendly and attentive.  Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Delicious Sunday brunch and football game what could it be more enjoyable!! Ordered steak & eggs for myself and cobb salad with extra smoked salmon for my girlfriend! grapefruit juice is really refreshing!! really good!! would've given 5 stars if we didn't have to wait 30 mins to be seated."}
{"text":"Aces to this place. Great atmosphere and they give you a run for the money. I got the ham and 4 eggs platter. The order came out right quick. But. When I asked for Greek toast. I guess she thought I said wheat. Doesn't matter. They gave me one slice and cut it in half. I had a problem with the eggs. They were cooked to perfection, but they were placed on top of each other, 2 by 2. As I only eat the yoke, they broke apart and I didn't have enough bread to slop them up. The ham was phenomenal. Nice and juicy. Portions in this town are not what I expected. We're not in Chicago anymore!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. I've come here 5 times in the last 2 weeks. 

The outdoor/indoor set up is really great on a beautiful day. 

The staff is fantastic and on top of things. 

They give you coffee and bottled water to go! 

And the border bowl is by far the best mix of greatness I've ever had. 4 scrambled eggs, peppers, hash browns, sausage, ham, and topped with pork green chili that melts in your mouth. 

Oh yeah and I forgot to mention the pancakes. They are literally a little slice of heaven. IHOP be damned."}
{"text":"From out of town and went base on recommendation of local.  Definitely did not disappoint.  Standard cup of joe and omelette was perfectly cooked.  Side of sliced fruit was nice added touch.  We would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Honestly, Ive never written a bad comment on Yelp. But this place kind of deserves it. A group of 6 of us went on a busy Saturday morning. We knew that there would be a wait, but didn't antisipate an hour wait, epecially when we were told 20 minutes. When they finally called our name 30 minutes after we checked in, 3 of us came to the host stand ready to be seated. The incredibly RUDE host told us that we needed our whole party to be seated ( I really wish she would have told us that when we checked in!!!) After the rest of our party had arrived, we walked up to the host stand and informed them that our party was complete. She then informed us that we would have to wait for a table to get up because they gave our table away. No big deal, so we stood up front and waited..... and waited..... and waited. Until finally the hostess heard us talking about how long we had waited, so she begrudgingly led us to our table while she rolled her eyes at us. The service once we sat at the table was fine, and the food was excellent. But i have NEVER been treated like that before as a guest.

I have been in the Restaraunt industry for almost 8 years, 5 of which I was a host, and 3 years as a server. I usually am not one to complain because I know how it is being on the other side of things. But seriously, the front of house service here is absolutely appauling. In my 8 years, I have NEVER treated a guest the way that I was treated here. Hopefully they hire some good people soon..."}
{"text":"Yummy! Had the signature French toast while enjoying outdoor seating with light water misters to keep you cool on a hot AZ day. The breakfast grilled cheese also looked amazing as it went by us and had been recommended by our waitress."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. The hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict was not hollandaise sauce, it was some runny yellow soup. The meal had no flavor, and the fruit was flavorless. Looking at photos from the reviews confirmed our visit was not isolated."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is good here. It was the service that our group received today that was not so good.

My company often orders breakfast to go from the Breakfast Club for store meetings. For this meeting we decided we should have an offsite meeting and go to the restaurant. We met this morning (Sunday) at 8:30am. We had a party of four total and my coworker and I were the first to show. The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away. The hostess sat us at a long table that was more of an 8 top rather than a 4 top, which I didn't understand because there were many booths open. Once the rest of our group arrived a few minutes later we were given maybe two to three minutes to look over the menu and the waitress seemed irritated that we weren't  ready to order yet. She seemed like she was in a constant rush the entire time.

I ordered the jalapeno biscuits and gravy which were amazing. The flavor of the gravy is great and it is also served with potatoes o brien which were also delicious. My group all finished their food rather quickly because we felt as though we were being rushed through our meal because our waitress constantly was hovering the table asking if we needed anything (in a pestering way not a helpful way). After our plates were cleared I had planned to do a quick team building exercise that would maybe take an extra 15 to 20 minutes max. I do understand that the restaurant was busy but I do not appreciate being rushed out while many other families were enjoying their meals for much longer than we planned to be here. Eventually the waitress came over and stated that she would be seating a party next to us (we were sitting on a bench style seat) which I had no problem with but it was the way in which we were approached that I did not appreciate. I just feel like the entire meal was extremely rushed and that made the experience not enjoyable for our whole team. If I were to plan a breakfast business meeting again anytime soon, I would not bring my business back to the Breakfast Club.

It is unfortunate because the food is great. I guess it's to go orders only from here on out."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had!! The service was amazing! The nutty French toast is a must. I love that they have big mimosas too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was the service! I had one of the omelets and the portion size was huge. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't like breakfast. I don't really like brunch. But Breakfast Club and a few other breakfast joints around the US are on my exceptions list; if I have a guest visiting over Saturday, I make it a point to each brunch with them here.

First off, the food is great. It's really good. The steak is always done well, the waffles slightly sweet, the fruit fresh, the ingredients, awesome. I've had most of their menu and I can honestly say, it's all good. Some better than others, but all are good. If it's your first time visiting, go with the Cinnamon Challah French Toast (the fruit is so delicious) and their Mignon Benedict Style Eggs. If you can and are willing, go for their fresh juice, a treat. Also try the Mimosa.
One of the reasons I'm a fan of this place, is the ingredients are very fresh and they don't saturate everything with tons of baking soda and powder. I can taste these things, and they don't use a ton of it.

The staff isn't always nice, sometimes rude; however, I'm ok with this, as all I want is for them to come when I signal and to keep my water glass filled at all time (which if you're unlucky you might end up with someone who can't do that).

Still, I'm a fan. I'm not a fan of breakfast and brunch, but for this place, I can atleast leave feeling like I've eaten something that doesn't give me a headache. For breakfast, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Went to The Breakfast Club a couple of weeks ago for lunch with a few of my Girlfriends. Place is really nice, clean and welcoming. Food was really good and the portions were huge. I ended up taking 1/3 of my omelet to go. server was nice and attentive. Only downside is the parking (in the back and limited) and that fact that the first one to arrive from our party was told that she can not be sited until all arrived (she had to sit at the tiny bar). Will definitely go again and you should try it too."}
{"text":"The breakfast club is definitely a great stand-by for good brunch food.  My personal favorite is the Turkey Bene, I really appreciate how great their hollandaise sauce is.  Also, the portions are great for the price.

I see this situation so often though where the food is great, but the service is pretty crappy.  The last time I went to the BClub was on a Sunday, which of course is their busiest day.  Our server didn't make eye contact with us for the first half of the meal.  Not even a smile.  I get it, Sundays probably suck to work as a brunch server...but hey, no one is forcing you to work here.  Put on your smile, and get through it.

If you want a conveniently located brunch place with good food, and you don't mind a wait, check this place out...just don't expect bubbly servers.
To improve the experience, stop by the bungalow across the street for a mimosa during your wait."}
{"text":"Under normal circumstances, I have this thing where I feel that anyone who is doofy and un-creative enough to name their establishment \"The Breakfast Club\" doesn't deserve my attention, business, nor opinion. But the line here is so freaking long during the weekends I just had to try it. 
The food is good! Servers are attentive and friendly, food and drinks come out at precisely the right moment (not too soon, not too late) and portions are pretty big. Ingredients are fresh and some of the dishes are creative. I've been here twice and have had a crab benedict and a build-your-own omelet (which includes choices of like a billion different veggies/meat and cheeses... i couldn't believe how many cheeses there were written on the board... what is it, ten? twelve? Heaven!) The crab benedict had more crab than I expected... maybe twice as much! Real crab, too, not \"krab\" although I'm not sure where it came from (obviously a can but prior to that, where did this come from?) 
The menu has a LOT of choices. My only drawbacks are the long wait (we have been told \"about 40 minutes\" and that turned into \"about 35 minutes\" after the first 40 were up), but this is a breakfast place after all, and while I do expect to wait, I don't like waiting twice. Also, there is no booze here. Granted, I probably don't NEED it... but if I had it, I would not feel that they should drop menu prices by about $1 or $2."}
{"text":"Full plates, fresh fruit bowls, good atmosphere and decent Bloodies."}
{"text":"An okay breakfast spot.

The good news? If you're staying at the W Scottsdale you can walk here, it's only a block away. Oh and the W has no other breakfast options unless you feel like eating at Sushi Roku, yuck.

The bad news? You'll likely have a bit of a wait and as far as breakfast places go, it's not that remarkable. Sure the eggs and bacon were fine, but nothing about this place says: kick ass breakfast. 

My friend and I were seated at the communal table. There was another random group of 2 seated at the other end. Two of my other friends tried to join us mid-meal (there were plenty of seats at the communal table) and were denied. The hostess said something about us dominating the communal table, not sure what that was supposed to mean but it sure was annoying."}
{"text":"Yum!  Cute spot, gets busy on the weekends.  Service is disinterestedly efficient, a plus in my book as I am not a talker and don't like chatty servers.  My husband favorably reviewed the bacon as \"nice and crispy.\"  I had the same omelet both times we went because it was SO DAMN GOOD!!! I got The Bird, a heavenly two egg omelet STUFFED (and they do mean STUFFED these are BIG!) with turkey, avocado, mushrooms and some kind of creamy perfection of a cheese.  I wasn't hungry again until diner after eating this.  The orange juice is good, but my husband wasn't thrilled with the coffee (he did give an approving nod to the large cream pitchers on the tables which prevented him having to go through his usual \"more cream please\" routine).  The other plus point for The Breakfast Club besides the outdoor seating (a little close to a busy street  and I didn't notice any misters on those July mornings, but at least its available) is that they serve my favorite McIlhenny Co chipotle tabasco sauce, the icing on the cake, or rather the hot sauce on the omelet as it were."}
{"text":"Some impressions:

Hostess tried to seat us at the worst table in the house (back, next to kitchen door)  in spite of the many open tables.  When we requested reseating, she obliged. Ambiance is open and noisy; plenty of room between tables; hard to hear the person across from you.

Waitrons, all female, wear a uni of skintight workout clothes.  So, like, if you'd like to do some Bikram yoga with your breakfast, maybe they can oblige.  Did I mention that they all appear to have been ordered from the same Chinese rubber factory?

\"Huevos con masa\" looked offbeat and interesting - a change from the usual breakfast stuff.  It was not.  Two not-very-hot eggs atop highly sweetened dry cornbread with a wobbly sauce that looked like cat upchuck.  Al dente dinner potatoes and a vicious-looking spear of fruit.  

Hey people - masa is not the same thing as cornbread.  WTF?

We looked at this and my pal ordered toast.  The waitress brought it promptly.  He asked for butter.  She looked at him funny, went back, eventually brought that out.  Then he asked for jam.  She looked at him funny again, and returned with some very nice raspberry preserves.  Evidently on this planet, people don't eat toast, and if they do, there better not be anything on it.

Total for breakfast about $30; we left two nearly-full plates of food on the table.

The toast was very good."}
{"text":"After reading about some of the reviews I was still optimistic that some people were over critical.  The food was decent.  I got the Eggs Benedict and it was pretty good.  I got bacon but it was over done, burnt and dry. It came with cut large cut pieces of assorted fruit which as very much welcomed.  The busboys I think make the place happy.  They were always really polite and never reached without asking.  Most of the staff were either groggy (it is the morning I can understand that) or just not happy to be there.  I asked where the restroom was and a server bascially looked at me, looked at the direction to go, pointed and turned her back to me.  I asked a general question to managment and he directed someone else to answer it for me.  I felt a little offended by this gesture.  The food is good but I will say it would be nice to have staff that are bit more oriented towards customer service."}
{"text":"Im not really a big breakfast person but in all the many years this place has been here this was my first time here. I kinda did a brunch type meal and had the Chicken Cesar Wrap with breakfast potatoes. Its came with sweet potato fries, but not really a fan of anything sweet potato flavored so switched it up. Was very good and flavorful, loaded with chicken. Also, had a bloody mary and i have to say was quite impressed.  Service was great as well and people were friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Totally a fan! Jam packed on a Friday morning when we walked past, we knew something good was inside. Super dog friendly, quick wait in line for a table outside, quick food delivery, excellent/friendly staff and the food was DELICIOUS! Get the fresh OJ and V18, huevos rancheros and the breakfast burrito. Spuds were delish. Yum! Great spot. GO!"}
{"text":"Very good food and ambient. 

    I went for the Border bowl which right away you could tell and taste the quality ingredients. The bowl was very big, the only thing I would recommend is to cut the size maybe a quarter and add tortillas maybe avocado even."}
{"text":"Definitely come here if you are from out of town and looking for fresh, fairly healthy fare. The wraps are generous and stuffed with fresh ingredients- some are spicy which could be a deal breaker for some. Very consistent in taste and presentation so we have our go-to faves which is the berry salad and turkey wrap - delicious! Crowded around noon so use No Wait app to get in line 20 minutes or so before you arrive."}
{"text":"BC Breakfast is the place to go, especially if you want a great breakfast to start the day off with. I was heading back home and walked from our hotel to this local joint. They have amazing fresh juices, I enjoyed the pineapple juice. $4.00 gets you a 'small' but it's a fairly large size. I has the BC bagel, (everything bagel that was perfectly toasted and had avocado, tomato and a nice house cream spread), yummy."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Great food, great service and overall just a good time. They play really good music, the service was great and the food was delicious! 

Even on a busy Saturday morning, we sat down fast and the food came out really fast. (I put us on the waitlist on Yelp. Walked in and sat down within 2 minutes) 

My favorite thing on the menu - the BISCUITS AND GRAVY!!! It's a jalapeño and cheese biscuit (OMG AMAZING!) and a hearty gravy with large chunks of sausage. They have freshly squeezed juices too! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Oh Scottsdale, you never fail to amaze me. Honest to God the entire staff had a nice orange glow to them straight from the tanning bed. Plus you even get attitude from the wait staff, I mean really? 

At any rate we sat at the \"bar\" and the \"bartender\" gave us our Cokes to-go, which was a really nice surprise."}
{"text":"This was my first not so good of an experience at Breakfast Club where we have frequently since moving to AZ. First my Bloody Mary was weak and the flavor was not there as usual. We ordered two omelettes, The Bird and Whole Hog. The Bird had no flavor and the Whole hog (our regular) just was not the same. Also had an order of French Toast and our friend requested to throw in a skillet to make it crispy, waitress said no problem. It did not come out crispy, and then she said that's the way it's served, but would see what she could do. Took it away and brought it back with no change. Ended up speaking to the manager to remove it from the bill. This has been a required stop when our friends visit, but has now been removed from our list. Seems their quality has gone down hill!"}
{"text":"Excellent on every level!  Only had the breakfast burrito, so perfect.  Service was outstanding.  Iced coffee was delicious.   Lime biked to BC and enjoyed a solo breakfast at the counter.  It was fun to witness all the people popping in to place takeout orders... the staff knew everyone by name.  Super cool spot!  I simply love Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"A must go!

This place is wonderful. The selection is comprehensive and the service is friendly and prompt. Our waitress Alicia was very approachable and knowledgeable with great recommendations. I had the Breakfast Burrito with the Pork Chili salsa... On point! Alicia noted how she loves to just eat the pork and I can see why! So great!

My boyfriend had the Heuvos con Masa and noted it was fantastic as well... Although we are just visiting, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast club has a good name and location at the north tip of Old Town Scottsdale. This place seems to always be packed on the weekends for breaky and brunch. Therefore, I recommend you find a day off, like a Tuesday morning to check it out. You'll get better faster service, wont be all noisy and you'll really be able to enjoy what this place has to offer: which is a very good staff and bright enjoyable atmosphere. 

Food: The food menu is decent, but nothing to write home about. You'll have your normal southwest breakfast dishes, pancakes, omelets, and skillets. I guess what they are known for are their selection of Benedict style eggs using different types of genres with hollandaise. Cant complain. 

Overall, its a solid stop and a place you should check out. It may end up being your fav breakfast place as many of my friends state that it is. I however put it as a solid back up to my favorites if they are too packed. All in all, I recommend, but its not at the very top."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good (nothing to write home about, as my boyfriend would say) but OH EM GEE they have THE BEST hot chocolate!!! I want to shout from the rooftops how much I love it & if I ever won the lottery, I would buy everyone a hot chocolate from here.

So yeah, try the hot chocolate."}
{"text":"So am here again only a week past. Have requested a waffle, hash browns and 2 eggs and bacon. Not busy here yet early but rush time soon. They claim all juice is fresh made. Orange tastes like is. So, my food choices were real good, all. I hope to take others here, and I will return for sure."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had bacon, eggs, toast and fruit. My mother had an omelette. We both enjoyed the dishes!"}
{"text":"The wait was long even on a Tuesday morning, but we sat at the bar and got fast, friendly service. The biscuits and gravy were good. Had the coconut iced coffee which was delicious and huge. The bacon was thick and crispy. The potatoes were fresh and overall the food was a great value for the money. Great breakfast option."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast or lunch. The egg dishes are generous and delicious. Sandwiches are the same. Service is good. 

When my brother was in town we went here for breakfast. When we wanted lunch on a couple of other occasions, he said \"lets go back to that place\". 

Hit this place up if you're visiting or local."}
{"text":"The breakfast club happen to be walking distance from the hotel we were staying so we decided to check it out, reasonable price and decent menu however the staff seemed in a rush to get you in and out since it does get packed and the waiting line was long, We opted for a shorter wait by eating at the first come/ first served bar. 

My breakfast was huge and tasted okay but nothing more than that... I had the Bello Bene: Portabella mushrooms, Bordelaise & Hollandaise.  

They also serve Bloody mary's and mimosa's to go with your Breakfast. 

My only advise.....Big portions so be hungry and be ready to wait to be seated if you are planning to visit this place over the weekends."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! We went on a Saturday morning, so we had to wait a little bit, but you can order drinks while you wait. The wait was worth it. Service was fantastic & very attentive. The food was delicious! I had traditional eggs Benedict & they actually poached the eggs properly (most places over cook them), my husband had hue is rancheros & they were very flavorful. All-in-all, a great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I would give them five stars but saw weed killer by the food. Great food but too many tourists and they changed the menu. Just don't sit at the counter. Service was slow"}
{"text":"Pass. Hard to say if this should be 2 or 3 stars but aside from the great patio seating, this place is very much mediocre. I got the salmon benedict and I can't recall what my husband ordered, so that should count for something. We're big Yelpers and tend to take photos of our meals, but this experience didn't warrant that. The menu is pretty standard but won't knock you out of the park. I'd suggest exploring elsewhere for a more \"brunch and mimosas\" outside type of place, of which there are plenty along this road."}
{"text":"Before I start my review I want to state that I previously went to the one in downtown Phoenix and I wasn't impressed at all !! So my aunt was in town from Detroit, MI and we wanted to take her out to breakfast as a family so that we one we showed her love while being out here and two so we don't get slandered when she goes back \"I didn't see them\"  anyone who has family can relate.  Moving forward we decided to take her here and I must say I was thoroughly impressed. It was a party of 8 my sister and I arrived first and the waitress did a great job of showing patience while waiting for the rest of our party to show up. Then I informed her how my first experience went and she gave me some recommendations and informed me if I didn't like what I ordered they could make me something else . I liked how she gave me that extra security while ordering my food!! So I decided to pick \"The Bird\" omelette(egg whites) meal with a side of Carmel Banana Foster French toast w/ ice cream on the side. It was amazing everything tasted amazing and it was hot and the presentation was great. My family and I enjoyed it and we appreciate when we can bring a out of town relative to a restaurant and hear her say \"I LOVE THIS PLACE\". I will dine here again.. Oh a helpful tip on weekends it can be packed and they don't take reservations but they do have a call ahead service which was beneficial! As soon as we got there they sat us at a table right away with no waiting!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's a little crowded around the times for which I would normally eat, but the wait is never too long. Everybody is always friendly and I've never had a problem with the service.

The food is fantastic! Huge in proportion (in my opinion, but I also don't eat large meals anyway). I've had the french toast, eggs benedict and pancakes, all of which were amazing; very flavorful and definitely worth the extra buck."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying Employee Whitney is a natural for customer service. It is rare for a restaurant veteran like me to find millennials who are capable of looking at your plate, cup or entree and determine what the customer needs. Whitney does this effortlessly. A Natural. If she is not a manager BC is missing the boat. Serving is all about serving. 
Food: Having lived at Citiscape with an adjacent BC I am fully aware of all the menu items but it is the BC French Toast that makes me drive from Chandler to Scottsdale. Fresh berries and roasted pecans without that syrupy goo most places like to add. Decent enough coffee and an open airy atmosphere in Scottsdale add to top quality. 
Service: Why 4 and not 5 stars. Three people were working the counter. Two seemed to be novice servers intent on smiling and looking good while Whitney took care of everyone at the counter whether it was her customer or not. With the NEW concept of walking into a restaurant and ordering at the register(hmmm, get the money before they eat) it is a telling trend that we are less inclined to deal with servers and tipping for sub par service( instead of training and retention of servers). Soon, if not already, service is rare in fast casual dining. There is an art to serving the general public. I've seen waiters put their kids thru medical school on their wages because it was a CRAFT and they took pride in what they did. Now, it's something to do between changing careers or schooling. 
I'd love to talk to the dishwasher. If management is good that person would want to be the BEST dishwasher. No dirty plates on their watch. It's all about personal Pride and Integrity. All of these things lead to longevity in this business."}
{"text":"I feel like a lot of people might be turned off from this place because of the crazy wait times. But they did add a wait list app system, which helps a lot! Clearly lots of people wanting to get in means it HAS to be good!

Honestly, the food here is really good. The menu is extensive so there is something for everyone. Their sweet cream pancakes are indescribably delicious for a breakfast lover like myself (added chocolate chips in my attached photo).

The other pictures show the bagel and lox (so pretty, right?!) and eggs benedict. Both were delicious and I always leave there super full!!

I love how they serve breakfast all day - I used to go in on my lunch break and build my own scramble for a quick healthy meal on the go! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Ok... So I am a sucker for a great breakfast joint that isn't some huge national chain.  Maybe it's the fact that orange county seriously lacks many good breakfast joint option.  Secondly, the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book.

Our trips to Scottsdale aren't complete until we make a stop here for breakfast.  The portions are huge!  The surprising part is that the food is good, which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions (usually hoping that size covers up the taste).

With their Mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero... They knock the cover off the ball.  The green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great staff! Had the Bird omelet and it was chock full of Turkey and avocados.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my original review, there seems to have been a change in the way that management schedules their regular staff.  We go to the Breakfast Club regularly and know the established staff very well.  It seems that now the staff (that has been there for a long time) are there very infrequently and there is a constantly revolving staff.  We are seeing the regulars stop coming and the (always) new staff don't seem to care as much.  
The food is still wonderful, prices are reasonable; but the owner and manager need to take a closer look at how the wait staff is scheduled.  Please understand that your long-time servers care about their customers!   You need to care about them as well!!  No one can make a living working a couple of days a week."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times and always enjoy the quality of service and food.
Today was no different! We waited for only 15 minutes, which on a Saturday is amazing! We were sat outside on the patio and quickly greeted by our server. She was very attentive and her whole demeanor was very easy going and friendly. I got a regular eggs Benedict which was awesome! 
The only thing was that when I went to the restroom a bird came by and started picking at my food. When I came back the server apologized and was very nice. The bird issue isn't something that the restaurant can control, but a piece of advice would be to have shades on the patio area so the bird won't have as easy of access swooping in."}
{"text":"Lived up to the positive reviews. I went with 3 other people on a Sunday at 11:30. There was a 20 minute wait, but I expected this. The food and service were great including the hostess. Two of us had  omelets, two had pancakes with a side of eggs. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I liked all of the fruit they had a a side with the omelets. The side potatoes were also good with a lo of sauteed veggies mixed in. Total bill for 4 people was about $50. I would go again next time I'm in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This was my first time having breakfast at Breakfast Club and I would definitely go back. Sunday morning, lots of people waiting, but they are really efficient at the hostess stand. They take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready. But be forewarned that they will not seat you until your entire party is there! 
I had the Burrito Bowl and it was really good. Crispy hashed browns on the bottom, topped with eggs scrambled with peppers, onions, and a variety of meats. What pushes the dish from good to great is the pork green chili that they put on top of the eggs! It has big chunks of tender pork in a spicy green chili sauce,  it's really flavorful and just spicy enough.  
My friend had the Lean & Green omelet and subbed feta for the swiss with no problem, she said it was really good, especially for a healthy breakfast. It was served with fruit and potatoes.
Our waitress was helpful and friendly and gave me a coffee to go!"}
{"text":"Popular, busy, and delicious!  I had a ham and cheese omelet and my daughter had 2 egg whites and a buckwheat waffle with fresh fruit. They were amazing. The waffle was light, fluffy, and flavorful. Service was great and our waitress was very friendly!  Allow for a 30 minute wait but breakfast came within 15 minutes.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food was great. Was seated right away . Food came out fast . My server was new, her name is Rachel. What an amazing server .When my food hit the table she was right there asking me if everything is how I like it .GREAT GREAT GREAT server . If you go to breakfast club to eat asked to be seated with her and you will have the best experience"}
{"text":"Server was not friendly, french toast was dry bread inside. Been here before and it was much better.  Enough said"}
{"text":"If the thought of breakfast makes you all tingly in your nether regions, then you have to eat at this place.  You will definitely feel...satiated.

I chose the BC's B&G - jalapeno biscuits topped with eggs (I chose scrambled) topped with sausage gravy and served with a side of potatoes and fruit.  Definitely hearty and kept me full until happy hour (more on that later).  The gravy was a little watered down to my liking, but the jalapeno flavor in the biscuit was subtle, but it was there when you bit into it.

Be prepared for a wait on the weekends, but you will be glad you did.  If you have a mimosa itch to scratch (no booze served here - hence 4 stars only), then walk over to Saddle Ranch while you are waiting."}
{"text":"alot of food. not a bad breakfast burrito but don't eat it while driving. Messy!"}
{"text":"ugghhhhh Breakfast club-  why did you change the most homey, comforting, warm breakfast spots in the Phoenix area??? \"WHY\"  Grandiose visions- now it' cold and corporate!  

the locals are just programmed- sheep!  I loved you so 8 months ago before you sold out!  

at least your coffee is still the bomb!

You just went off my top ten list.  What the hell do I even need to visit Scottsdale anymore for ;("}
{"text":"The food is good and the location is perfect. A solid breakfast spot in Oldtown. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. 4 egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.

The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy)."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday morning and was promptly seated on the patio. Waited about 20 mins, not even a glass of water. Several employees walked passed us -- so we left. Looked like a nice place but didn't want to deal with crappy service."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Breakfast Club to meet a family member who was in town for a quick layover.  I didn't know too much about the place going in, other than it was on the wife's list of places to try.  I have to say I was definitely impressed.

We arrived sometime around 10am on a Sunday morning and were able to be seated within five minutes, which was nice.  I ordered the turkey/avocado/boursin omelet.  (This normally comes w/ mushroom but I got it without).  All I can say is wow!  This was a delicious omelet, I literally ate the whole thing (though I did slow down for a moment so my wife could taste a bite).  The service was good, though a little slow on bringing the check, though after that I did appreciate that they didn't pressure us to leave while we caught up, even though a line had formed.  

Great food, this is more like a 4.5, rounded down to 4."}
{"text":"Everything here rocks!  Excellent java...iced or hot and they will give you a roader...I had eggs over medium...cooked perfect with a nice buttery taste, a crazy great piece of grilled turkey...IDK what it was but so darn tasty, fresh fruit and the cranberry toast...oooo I want it now!!!
My mates had choc chip pancakes and they were tasty, fluffy and so yummy!  The home fries were awesome as well...this was a fantabulous foodtastic time!"}
{"text":"I'm catching up on some Yelping and I did not want to forget about this place!  New to the area and brought some friends here who were in from out of town.  We all had a great time!  Food was delicious.  Atmosphere is happy-go-lucky.  Service was on point.  It was a great place to start the day as I showed some folks around my new hometown."}
{"text":"Long wait.  Ordered nutty pancakes,  Spied neighbor's great-looking omelette while waiting for said pancakes.  Tasted the cakes and wished I'd ordered the eggs.  Price-y menu made my mediocre dish even more disappointing.

Felt out of place here with so many well-dressed, salon-bed tanned people. Breakfast is my favorite time of the day, and dining here brought my cheerful mood down fast."}
{"text":"We had the cobb salad, we were staying away from carbs that day.  Very nice place and the salad was good, not great, but its a breakfast place.  Great atmosphere, service a little on the slow side, we were there at 1130 am.  We will return for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club's plate of huevos rancheros is bigger than anything anyone should ever eat in the morning. I ate it. Half of it, that is.

It's essentially a giant tortilla filled with what looked to be 5-6 scrambled eggs, black beans, avocado, fresh salsa and green chili pork. I could have split this with three people and still been full. The whole menu looked awesome, including the drinks like fresh squeezed juice and hot bevvies from their coffee bar. I just got a regular coffee, and refills were brought promptly by our server.

Lindsey F. and I hung out on the sidewalk patio, which was the way to go on a sunny morning. It was busy for a Wednesday I thought, and it was pretty loud inside. There was a short wait for an outdoor table, but they had a couple of their \"community seating\" spots available when I came in. That's where you sit with another group at the same table. They won't seat you until your whole party is on the premises either, so make sure you don't have late-comers on a busy weekend morning. I'm sure this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Is this where aspiring porno stars go to be seen and discovered? Besides LA, I've never been surrounded by so many silicon-chested, orange-fleshed, platinum blondes before in my life. It's like I've been transported into a really bad tv show hybrid of Real Housewives and Real Sex. 

Anyway, when I could unglue my eyes from Ms. Chestica McBlondie next to me, I had an omelette with turkey, boursin cheese, and avocado. Overall, the food was pretty good, but I just couldn't focus on the food. The sillicon balloons all around me had my full, undivided attention. Man, guys must love this place."}
{"text":"Went here for spring training, the portions are HUGE! (My friend ordered an omelet). I ordered a traditional benedict. The hollandaise was a little liquidity and my egg was poached just a little too much (the yolk didn't spill) so I wasn't crazy about my breakfast, but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I love this place. Never had a bad breakfast yet. The service is always good, and the  atmosphere is pleasant.  Recently they did some renovations and are expanding, so during my most recent visit, the area I was seated in was under construction, but those things happen. It didn't effect the quality of service or food. Some of my favorities are the Eggs Benedict, their breakfast burrito, and their chocolate chip pancakes, which are amazing if you're in the mood for a sweeter breakfast. Their smoothies are also refreshing. Not to mention, the cougar waitresses are easy on the eyes :), and very friendly. I will be going back next chance I get."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale is a great spot to sit and eat breakfast or grab coffee or a smoothie on the go! It is conveniently located and you can sit inside or outside. The staff is friendly and while we were waiting for the coffee order multiple people checked in to make sure we were being helped. 

The ice coffee was very refreshing and our group ordered the quick start, quick start conscious and the traditional bene. I had the quick start conscious which came with egg whites, broccoli, tomato and a side of cottage cheese and fruit. It was fresh, filling and felt guilt free indulging. The traditional bene was a big hit with the group as well.

If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in for some breakfast!"}
{"text":"Called in at 10 am to get in the waitlist for a table of 10 that we would using at 11 am. We were told we would be able to get a table by then. We got here at 10:45 am to make sure we would not lose our table. We've been waiting for an 1 hr plus now and barely getting a table at 12. I do not recommend this restaurant for big parties at all. Food is great but service can be hit or miss and it takes way too long to get seated even if you join the waitlist."}
{"text":"Cute place! But too much hype I think. The food was just okay and we waited about an hour and thirty minutes. Wouldn't go again. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Excellent location!

I have been to this establishment a few times and would recommend sitting outside, because the interior gets a little noisy.

If you experience high wait times, just walk around the neighborhood!  There is a nice bakery nearby, as well as a little coffee shop.

While I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, the pancakes keep bringing me back.

Their pancakes are infused with a lot of flavors and the portions will fill you up fast.

Prices are somewhat affordable, but a family of 4-5 can easily rack up a $60 bill.

Don't hesitate to visit.  This is one of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food took forever. I felt like they were trying to kick us out halfway through our meal. Good food and chai tea"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places.  

Heads up, to prevent sticker shock on your check...  Expect $20 per person.  Some people don't think that you should have to pay $20 for breakfast.  Then again, this isn't Denny's.  

The food is always delicious.  Try the biscuits and gravy, nothing too complicated.  

Most likely, there will always be a wait when you get here.  This is a very popular breakfast place for tourists.  I'm not sure how they find out about it, but you won't find any special priority seating for being a local Scottsdalian.   

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"O-M-Goodness! What luck to have eaten here for breakfast!! Huge portions served with fresh fruit slices or mixed berries. Great service and very nice to sit on the porch under the heat towers as it was a cold morning. The only downside was there were so many good things it was hard to choose!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Great food, service, and a cute name!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna judge on food and than will rate customer service at bottom. 

The food was fantastic! I ordered the breakfast grilled cheese and it was phenomenal! The mushroom ommlet was also very yummy and filling, however the fruit served with it was out of season and bitter. The orange juice was OK and for the price I would definently sit it out the next time I go there. 

Now the customer service.. our waitress was pretty snooty..look I know I wasn't dressed in the best clothes. Lulu lemon yoga pants and a victoria secret hoodie but It was breakfast time and I was comfy get over it. Yet the table next to us where the girl who apperead to be around the same age as me was wearing a nice shirt and carrying a Louis bag got a huge friendly smile while you just had a blank dull fake smile when you talked to us..you would have gotten a good tip, but instead your attitude was unprofessional and rude. Not impressed with that aspect."}
{"text":"One of our must go to places to eat when coming to Phoenix/Scottsdale. Always good quality food! The berry salad Topped with the Pine crusted chicken breast is my favorite. All egg dishes and sandwiches are excellent. Their signature French toast dish is over-the-top delicious."}
{"text":"This is my husband favorite place for breakfast and my second favorite ( Butters)  This place is always busy so if you go on the weekend be prepared to wait. Food is consistently delicious and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot.  Coffee service was on point and the food was tasty.  Just what I needed before a long day of meetings and travel."}
{"text":"Huevos con masa!!! I come here every morning on my vacation for this treat, and I dream about it when I'm at home halfway across the country :) it's a must!!"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS want what my friend gets. He got something with the word Masa in the name and it was amazing. I got huevos rancheros and it was good not as amazing as my friend's awesome choice. 

We sat outdoors on the sidewalk seating which was nice if a little chilly. It was sort of weird when people would go flying by on their bicycles. 

The prices here were GREAT for the quality of food you got. I'm a huge fan of this place and want to come all the way back from Washington to get that one masa dish."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the new look after the remodeling. And the place is more than twice the size of what it was before! No more long lines, even during tourist season.  Same great food and service are still there."}
{"text":"I know The Breakfast Club has been here since at least a year or two before I moved from AZ (which was a little over 3 years ago) and I never tried it until this past week when I was in town for the Holidays.  I can remember many a Saturday & Sunday mornings being driven back to Old Town (often times by my mother) to retrieve my car from the night before and always debating on grabbing a hangover breakfast here, but I never did.

Anyways, I came here for lunch and I really liked it.  Apparently this place has had a pretty extensive renovation recently and is quite a bit bigger than it once was.  It was crowded and we had a bit of wait for a table (and this was on a Tuesday).  From what I understand this is often times the case here.

One of the reasons this place never really tickled my fancy is because something about it just always seemed pretentious for whatever reason, but that's not the case at all.  Sure, the decor is nicer than Denny's but it's still pretty comfortable.  Both the the breakfast & lunch menus sounded delicious & hearty.  I was surprised.  The portions were big & there was several options. 

I decided to go w/a lunch option (the grilled chicken sandwich), and it was delicious.  It came w/sweet potato fries, which were good.  Between the sandwich and the fries there was quite a bit of food on my plate for only about $8.  Most of the breakfast & lunch items are around &10 and under.  

Even though this place isn't pretentious like I thought it would be when I ordered a diet coke our waitress informed me that they only have \"natural soda in bottles.\"  However, I'm giving brownie points because as the waitress was telling me this she rolled her eyes (not at me, but at how ridiculous that is).  

Overall, I really enjoyed Breakfast Club and it's a solid breakfast and/or lunch option in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. They don't have very many alcoholic beverages and their menu is very boring. I think this place is an overrated Denny's."}
{"text":"We needed to have an early breakfast since my husband and I were both working that morning.  We had planned on going to RnR, but they were closed when we got there at 7:30....I really need to stop assuming that restaurants actually open early for breakfast!!    My husband was working in the area and notice the Breakfast Club the day before and suggested that we give it a try.  I almost never try any restaurant without checking it out on Yelp first, but we were in a pinch.  

Well, you know that saying \"everything happens for a reason\"...well, the reason by RnR wasn't open was so we would try Breakfast Club.  The host at the door was very friendly and welcoming, the restaurant was spotless, the service was very friendly and attentive, and the food was VERY good!

My husband had a custom-created omelet that was the Southwest version of a Denver omelet, but with Chorizo instead of ham.  It was fluffy and flavorful and loaded with tons of fresh veggies, cheese, and tasty Chorizo.  The omelet was plated with fresh sliced fruit, and AMAZING potatoes!!

I had the Southwest breakfast burrito and it was delicious!  It was eggs, Refritos negros, Lettuce, Chorizo & Cheddar Cheese.  (It usually comes with Pepperjack, but I subbed for Cheddar).  It was topped with a spicy sauce and I could have had it topped with Green Pork or Chorizo Queso, but I went plain.  It was very, very good!  My plate was also adorned with delicious fresh sliced fruit and the AMAZING potatoes.   The potatoes are large pieces of tenderly sauteed red potatoes with fresh peppers and onions.  Seriously...I have eaten many types of breakfast potatoes in my day and these are easily in the top 5!

We are only here for 4 days and I wouldn't be surprised if we go back again before we leave!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I've been here a few time and everything I've tried was outstanding. Just place just location especially if going to a ballgame. In the heart or Old Town, great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"After going to the city scape location LITERALLY last week, I was sooo impressed not only by the food but by the customer service. Not to mention that we came to eat close to closing time the waitress we had was amazing!! Super sweet and patient since it was our first time to BC. 

The Scottsdale location on the other hand is literally night and day. Food was okay, although my hash browns were a little burnt. Sitting here waiting for my mom to finish eating and our water cups have been empty for a while, yet she was able to drop off the check? Is your service done now? Like we're still here. Also we were never even asked how our meal was. 

Definitely will drive that extra 10 min to go to the Phoenix city scape location. 

Update: a busser refilled our water. Thank you for doing our servers job!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and my second to last experience was not good and I hadn't been back in awhile. However, a friend wanted to meet up there and have breakfast this morning so I decided to give it another try. To my disappointment the 2nd chance experience was just as terrible as my first bad experience if not worse. I don't feel bad for writing this negative review either because my friend (who suggested the place) was appalled as well by our time there. 
If you only have 20-30 minutes to grab a bite to eat then I would recommend this place. Other than that I won't be coming here again. Try the Orange Table for better food and better service.
Upon my arrival I went to the host stand where two girls were present. I requested a table for 2 and the blond RUDELY informed me that they didn't sit incomplete parties. I have no problem with that, I work at a restaurant with the same policy but the tone of voice of how you tell people is always key and hers was definitely rude. When we finally got sat there was miscommunication between the two girls working and it was clear that the brunette hostess was having a serious problem with her fellow blond coworker. My friend and I shook it off and were simply happy to be sitting at a table with our hopes of breakfast on the way. 
The service started out ok, but because we're servers as well my friend and I were prompt in ordering and made it easy. Food was out quickly which was nice but I wasn't pleased with the quality as I have been times before. My omelette was extremely oily, which is never something you want especially when you order an eggwhite veggie omelette, and my potatoes were undercooked. The fruit was mostly what I ate. After about 15- 20 minutes of dining our server came over and dropped off the check. My friend and I were both not even half way through our breakfast, forks full with the next bite, and our server Bethany didn't even offer us anything else while my coffee sat 3/4 empty awaiting a refill (which I finally had to ask someone else for). We were a little put off that she dropped the check so soon and we both felt rushed. After another ten minutes Bethany came back and offered us coffees to go. A nice gesture but the fact that we hadn't even touched the check and were still eating simply stated that she wanted us gone. We looked around the restaurant wondering if they were waiting on our table for something but noticed that there were 3 or 4 empty table around us and nobody waiting by the host stand so we didn't think so. Upon checking my watch I noticed that we hadn't even been there 45 minutes. 
We continued to enjoy what we could of our breakfast but at this point we felt so rushed that we sat there til the last second possible before we had to go. This experience fell hand in hand with my last negative experience where I was literally told to leave by the busser after an hour and a half because people were waiting. Like I said I'm a server myself but these people are so eager to turn tables that it simply takes the enjoyment out of going out to breakfast and having a nice meal with a fancy mimosa. If I do go to the Breakfast Club again it will be at there downtown location but that will be no time soon. If you're in Old Town looking for a good breakfast joint save the rushed feeling that they put on you and enjoy it somewhere else like the Orange Table or Morning Squeeze. Even Daily Dose right down the road have good breakfast! The BC just isn't worth it any more."}
{"text":"Love BC with a passion. There is Nowhere else I would go for my daily breakfast. The staff there is to give the credit to. They are top notched and unmatched"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh meal. Great and fast,service.Nice and friendly staff. Good location. 
We will be back again."}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful! The best part was I could actually see in the kitchen. This transparency was great! Eat here! Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time on yesterday morning (Memorial Day) while nursing a sweet hangover from having too much fun the day before.  We arrived just a bit after 8, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.

This food was great!   Being from the south I LOVE biscuits and gravy, so I was excited when I saw BC's B&G (Breakfast Club's Biscuits & Gravy) on the menu.  However I was equally as excited about the Oscar Eggs Benedict.  My server made it easy for me to decide when she told me they were out of the crab meat which is used to make the Oscar.

A few delicious cups of coffee later, my B&G arrived, looking delicious with a side of some perfectly ripe fruit and yummy potatoes.  The B&G is actually jalapeno biscuits, which taste almost doughy.  They were good, but different.  Then they are topped with melted fontina, eggs, sausage gravy and some hot sauce.  The only thing I would change is the cheese.  For some reason, the fontina just added an odd taste to an otherwise delicious meal.  I still ate about 3/4 of it, but would definitely request a different type of cheese next time.  My two dining companions each got a different type of omelet and they both enjoyed them.

With its close proximity to my house, I definitely think I will be dining here quite  a bit."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the morning off during the week on a Wednesday and we called in when we were in our way just to see how long the wait was and she put us on the wait list right away without us even thinking we needed to (just incase it got busy). 

The parking was so bad though. But, anywhere in this area has parking problems it seems like. We walked in and got a table within 5 minutes and the waitress got us water right away. 

I haven't been here in about 4 years so I didn't remember what I got. I just knew I wanted pancakes as well! We both got some amazing omelettes and a side of their potatoes and we were loving it! 

I don't eat a lot of breakfast but when we go out to eat and there's good breakfast food then I never forget it!"}
{"text":"We used the waitlist and as soon as we arrived, we were seated. Great service and awesome food! The staff were very friendly and upbeat. It's always nice to go to a restaurant where the staff seems to enjoy their place of employment. No complains - just pure satisfaction!"}
{"text":"I have driven by breakfast club often and there is always a line. As a result I have never stopped to eat. Yesterday, on Sunday, I braved the crowds and tried BC for the first time. 

Service was great. Even though the restaurant was very busy, the servers and waitresses did a great job of taking our order, keeping our glasses filled, and getting us our food quickly. 

The food was good, but not the most amazing breakfast I have ever had. 

I would/will go again, but it will probably be a few months before I look at going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a weekday morning, and there was virtually no wait. We eat paleo, so I ordered carved ham and two egg whites a la carte, and he had the Quick Start Conscious (4 egg whites, Broccoli, Cottage Cheese, Tomato and Fruit). We appreciate their healthy options. The service was quick and friendly. We'll definitely return, but we'll maintain our weekday visit. I hate to wait!"}
{"text":"Their food is beautifully plated, generously proportioned, and excellent service.  The pancakes and huevos rancheros were works of art (and tasty)!"}
{"text":"This place is favorite go to anytime company comes from out of town.  Awesome food, great staff."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10 years. One of the best breakfast places on Earth. To the Dip s*%t who gave this place 1 star for having a wait....it's busy because it's the # 1 place in town, you ignorant tourist! The food is always consistent, great portions, and well priced. Truly a staple in our town. 
-Cheers"}
{"text":"I had one of the most amazing brunches of my life at the Breakfast Club in Phoenix.  I went with a large party and we had a to wait a bit for a table, but they had a coffee bar which was super convenient.  The iced coffee was incredible, so delicious and strong--the wait time flew by.  

The menu options are incredible.  I had so much trouble deciding which omelet I wanted, so a few of my friends and I ordered 3 and split them in thirds.  My favorite one included mozzarella, tomatoes and pesto. They are large enough to do that, and are served with roasted veggies, potatoes and melon. Totally unique compared to the standard toast and hash browns that you normally get with an omelets. 

Service was efficient and friendly, which I appreciated with the large group. Honestly, I can't stop thinking about brunch and wish I had more time in Phoenix to go back to The Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I would recommend it to anyone!  Customer service was amazing and their hash browns were so unique and delicious!  They had onions ands bell peppers in them!! So great!! Fun environment and you can sit inside or outside.. love it"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Our waitress was excellent. They have a really good coffee bar. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I arrived on a Saturday morning around 9:30 am, and we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait (which we were expecting). We were seated within 30 minutes at a nice large booth. Once seated, our waitress immediately introduced herself to us. She was very kind, friendly and professional. We received our food and drinks in a timely manner, and the food was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place has quite the hype in Old Town Scottsdale, however I have begun to wonder why. Consistently I have received poor service the multiple times I have been, though the food is not terrible, it is certainly not a place to go have a meal with a staff that does not really hear and pay attention to what a customer is saying.
We received the bill on this last visit, there was an item that was not ours, which I suspect is when the waitress goofed on the computer because when my breakfast arrived it was wrong, followed by taking 10 minutes to produce the right one. Then we asked her to fix it, my friend had put down her card, before noticing the goof, however we were going to separate the bill with our items; the waitress assumed she was paying and charged the whole bill to her card (she did not bother to clarify how we wanted to pay). Then we let her know we wanted to separate our items (I had even pen marked which items were mine on the itemized receipt). She then comes back with the bill just split in half, at this point we were already frustrated that our waitress refused to listen to us and simply kept making assumptions.
I will not come here again (this is not the first time our service has been less than sublime), the food is not worth feeling as though the staff is not paying attention to their customers. 
P.s., consistently when choosing a table outside, I have noticed they are slow to start the table off with even drinks at the least, thus keeping you waiting."}
{"text":"Breakfast club at 9 am on a Wed half full with customers. 

The food is good but the hostesses are extremely rude especially this young lady. 

When my friend and I came to BC we spoke with this young lady and asked if we could be seated while we wait for the third person in out party and have mimosas. She quickly replied No. We will not seat you until your whole party is here and if you want a mimosas you can go over to that counter and order it. We asked why the restaurant is empty and she turned her heard and said that's just policy. Come see us when you whole party is here and instantly resumed her convo with the other hostesses. Had to speak with the manager to get seated."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised with the Breakfast Club.  
I wanted to take my mom to a nice brunch on a Monday...and I thought the Orange Table.  We walked in there and they stopped breakfast at 11, so I knew that I never went to the Breakfast Club before, but thought hey why not.

It was such a windy day when we went and the newspapers were flying everywhere on our table.  But we still enjoyed ourselves.  Service was wonderful; very attentive.   My mom loved her pancakes and I was so thrilled to find french toast made of challah!  (There is no other way to make french toast)  I also had hash browns (wanted the carbs I guess) and they were awesome as well.

The prices were a little bit high for breakfast food, but I have to remember that I am in Old Town Scottsdale.  I would love to go back there anytime. :)"}
{"text":"Terrible! Some of the worst service and management I've ever seen! Our server said about two words to us the entire time, and checked on us one time before bringing us the check. The manager looked completely unprofessional, he was chewing gum, had blood shot eyes, and smelled like alcohol! The food was overpriced, their pancakes cost $8 without any sides. I will never go back again..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it never disappoints.  Usually come in here for brunch and each time it's just simple and well done.  Would highly recommend.  The Eggs Benedict are excellent.  Can't go wrong with the Traditional Bene!!! Wait staff is always friendly and love that they also have a coffee bar.."}
{"text":"There was a long wait but that's expected in Scottsdale. I got a coffee at the juice bar while waiting, which was perfect. Their food was delicious and the service was excellent. Also, their mimosas were giant. I loved it and would recommend to others. Just expect a wait"}
{"text":"one of my fav breakfast spots! I would agree that service is just avg at best ... just shows how much I like the food. that is, the place still gets 5 stars with blah, blah service. 

Dear owner - the cooks/chefs should be paid much, much more than your servers / front folks ... it is the thing that brings me back and gets your 5 rating. BUT if you do not eventually fix the service issue, I will adjust the rating lower ..."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before but after my experience here, I thought I would come and give my two cents.

I suggested coming here with my boyfriend and his friend for his birthday since we were on this side of town. Big mistake. The hostess told us 25 minutes and we ended up waiting closer to 45 minutes. When our friend asked about the long wait they assured us that the 7 tables in front of us would be seated if we waited just 10 minutes more. I wish they would've just over estimated the time so we would be prepared for a long wait. 

I have never been more embarrassed in my life to suggest a place when the hostess seated us at a wet table and threw the menus down and walked away after seating us. After that, it didn't matter how hip or delicious the food was, I am never going back here."}
{"text":"I love the Breakfast Club! My dad is a huge breakfast person and while he's been in town, has yet to enjoy any local places I've taken him, but he was SO impressed here. In his words, \"everything has flavor and was portioned well\". We love the Breakfast Club!"}
{"text":"After hiking Camelback we were looking for a breakfast spot near by. It was an easy pic to go with this place. It was really crowded unlike other places nearby that serve breakfast/brunch. 

The menu offers a great variety of items to choose from. I went with something simple and ordered 2 eggs (scrambled), bacon, toast and added hash browns for a slight up charge (7.35). I thought the hash browns were especially tasty and the bacon was crispy just as I had requested. My hubby ordered the breakfast burrito (13) with the extra sauce which they call \"monster style\". Please split this with someone and you will be much happier. It's a very large portion. 

The atmosphere here is trendy and I like the openness of the restaurant. There's different seating options which is nice although most of the outside seating is right on Scottsdale road. We sat around the counter which I found enjoyable. Prices are reasonable and the service was good. Just don't expect anything fancy here. This is a cute casual breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Riding a bike nearby customer 's eating going very slowly. Out walks a waitress verbally asssaulting us! In front of the customers. No one hit by either bike. No signs up. Decided to have breakfast in a friendlier environment. FYI"}
{"text":"I was all set to order after downloading the menu two days before we went, then when we arrive on Sunday late morning, things went awry....First of all the homemade tomato soup is not exactly home made in that they use canned tomatoes for the soup which means it is filled with nickel, metal, lead and bpa...so I could not have the tomato soup as they were not able to use any fresh tomatoes for the soup, not exactly sure if they use canned tomatoes for the omelettes but this is what the waitress eluded to...Also they do not know what the ingredients is in lots of their products especially the bread since they do not make it, it is delivered from a vendor and there is no ingredient list...Very Very Bad service on their part, they should always know what the ingredients is for everything they serve especially for folks who may have allergies....The other people in our party got the build your own omelette which was very expensive, they did not have a veggie omelette on the menu you have to build your own...so the omelettes ended up being over $12.00 since they charge .75 cents to $2.50 for extra items...The orange juice is also very expensive 4.00 for what look like a 6oz glass and $7.00 for what looked like a 12 oz glass. Plus it was very very noisy, we literally had to yell at each other to hear ourselves plus ...Just the fact they did not know what the ingredients was in their bread, and many of their ingredients come pre-packaged not made from scratch....is not good....there are better places in old town,,,which have organic food offerings and they know what they are serving, unlike the breakfast club.......If you have food allergies avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"Once again the breakfast club does not disappoint you and what are their signature omelettes customized to my liking with my grilled onions and grilled mushrooms fabulous fabulous fabulous service was extremely courteous and extremely friendly my waiter Jayme and her coworkers make sure you have all you need. Besides they have a great people watching  outside seating area at the Scottsdale location.  Definitely recommend it to anyone in the area, not pricey either."}
{"text":"Decent place to have breakfast. We had a great breakfast this morning. Prices are cheap with fast services. I had a Quickstart on the menu, beautiful dish with everything I need for my first meal."}
{"text":"We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was great as always, and the place looks and feels clean. Our meals were ordered and delivered to us super quickly as well! Our waitress was good at filling our glasses back up and taking plates out of the way when needed, but she seemed just a little snobby. Otherwise, 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place and my first review on it. I thoroughly enjoyed both visits here. Breakfast club is located in the heart of old town Scottsdale and is in a great location. I like this place because of its fast and friendly service and the pancakes are very delicious. I also like the fact that they offer turkey products as well and not just pork. It's interesting how several breakfast restaurants still do not offer turkey alternatives to their sausage and bacon foods. 

In addition, make sure that you try their coffee. They have one of the best coffee's I have had at a breakfast restaurant. The next time I am in the area I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Friendly server and yummy options for breakfast! The waffle was good- wish the servings were a bit larger, but overall a nice meal."}
{"text":"I've been to the Breakfast Club several times now and it just gets worse and worse. The only thing this place has going for it is the cheap breakfast cocktails and you're gonna need one if you want to stomach the food. 
Firstly it is expensive. Secondly it is greasy when it feels like they claim to be a health type restaurant. Thirdly they have messed up my order almost every single time. Often things are missing that I asked for or cheese on an omelet isn't melted - that's just plain unappetizing! There are plenty of other breakfast places in the surrounding area that are more worth your while. Skip this place and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"trendy but the food is great and the staff is incredibly nice, don't not go because of the old town stigma. There is a loooong looong wait for breakfast on the weekends but definitely try it at least once because it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. From the bad attitude of the hostess to the waitress who could care less.  We walked out"}
{"text":"Ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was delicious! I didn't mix it all together but instead ate from a couple parts at a time to enjoy all the flavors. Also ordered the Quick Start Loaded and it's the right portion for a great price. I also had a bite of The Bird and I love the filling in this omelet!  The service was quick and great and I think the food is worth the price here."}
{"text":"One of my favorites where I know I will always love my meal- breakfast all-day or lunch! I work nearby so I also pick up the yummy, yummy spring berry salad with tuna or delicious pine crusted chicken.  My favorites are a build your own omelette with a huge variety of options, French toast, turkey rueben with sweet potato fries and the above mentioned berry salad with pine crusted chicken.

The servers sometimes have what I will call an \"i'm Hip, Scottsdale attitude\" but they are generally very efficient and attentive (kind of like if you are in NYC). 

I love the new expanded space and the large counter service."}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast today!  The waitress was fun and friendly and ...hot!  The food was a nice big plateful of awesomeness and hot!  I had eggs over easy, turkey cutlet which is this amazing piece of protein unique to Breakfast Club toast and their stellar iced coffee.  The Omelets and stack of hot cakes are amazing too."}
{"text":"idk. this place is just so idk. 

I feel greasy after i eat here. like that sneak-up starbucks grease feeling. The food isn't visibly dripping in grease, but it makes my insides feel like an angry incinerator. this has been after getting the breakfast grilled cheese, the breakfast burrito, the turkey reuben, and the tuna melt. those are all adequately different things. So, its not like i just keep making the same mistake.

idk, people seem to really like this place. I feel like there are just a lot of better breakfast/lunch places literally on the same street with better/more interesting menus and better food"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, i really did.. i even waiting 45 minutes in the cold hoping for a great experience.  What we have here is a typical Scottsdale joint, trendy and hip(ster).  The eggs benedict was ok, but eclipsed by even Village Inn's version, they did have decent coffee though, and once seated in our cramped booth, the service was great."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! I would go here every day for breakfast if I could. The iced tea is AMAZING! Call ahead to get your name on the list. Try the bananas foster pancake with ice cream!! It's amazing! Also do the breakfast grilled cheese - best sandwich ever!"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese breakfast sandwich is really good. I would go there earlier to beat the crowd. The staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.  I will eat here every morning while I am visiting Scottsdale.  If you have a chance to visit this place, definitely do so.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage, bacon, and no beans.  It came with this indescribably delicious chorizo queso sauce and I savored every bite.  Also, as I looked around at the other orders, I could not see anything that looked short of delicious."}
{"text":"I went here on a sunday after a hard night's partyin' and I am so glad I did... i had THE BEST BRUNCH of my life here! Like seriously!

I can't even remember what everyone got but we stuffed our faces and couldn't stop talking about how delish everything was. 

I do remember what I got tho...I got the banana foster breakfast...and HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THINGS DELICIOUS!!! It was UH-AMAZING! Everyone was eating off my plate until I nearly chopped off hands! 

Only complaint I have is that the Bloody Mary wasn't good. But I will not deduct a star because...well...with something as delicious as that darn Bananas Foster, to hell with the Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"It is no big deal. The coffee is better than most places. The food is standard. Nothing unique. The juice comes right out of a bottle - how boring, buy a juicer! Be creative! Way too crowded, even on weekday mornings. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Well , long wait . No coffee, wrong meal delivered. Geez. Not so happy. Once correct food came it was really good ."}
{"text":"It was so delicious!!! I got the lean and green and substituted the feta for swiss!! The potatoes o'brien were tasty as well. There was a small side of fresh fruit which complimented the breakfast. My friend got the burrito bowl which was amazing!!! It was enormous and she took more than half of it home with her. We will be back to sample some more of the menu to report back!!!!"}
{"text":"if you don't know, you better ask somebodayyy!

BEST brunch ever! the steak &eggs is freaking delicious! The plate comes with fresh fruit, toast and obrien potatoes (BOMB). My friends ordered the buckwheat pancakes and LOVED them. The service is awesome too. 

fyi... On weekends, prepare to wait at least half an hr before being seated. This place is packed! Parking is okay."}
{"text":"very popular, that can lead to waits for table

very local:  sitting at the 4-seat  breakfast bar (if you can snag a seat) you'll notice that all the patrons know the server very well

fine breakfast (tho a lilttle expensive for area) like excellent bacon and toast."}
{"text":"As below average as one can expect of any restaurant in South Scottsdale.

We wound up here, I don't know how, for breakfast this morning... and let's just say - it was everything I thought it would be.

Snooty waitstaff - check
Overpriced completely average food - check
Pretentious crowd - check

I got a $10 waffle and a $3 bottle of Figi water.  My husband had a sip of OJ for his $2.50, then spent another $2.50 on coffee (no creamer).  He also had really greasy potatoes and an \"eh\" omelette (and he is not hard to impress with food).

Why two stars?  His fruit was good.  Last I checked, that's thanks to God and good farmers, not snooty Scottsdalites.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food.  Service is OK, not outstanding.  Huevos con masa - amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast! Delicious beyond delicious! Very friendly wait staff, top quality ingredients, this place is an absolute win!"}
{"text":"There was a little wait to be seated but the coffee bar had seats and it was great to be able to get our coffee while we waited. Service was fast and friendly. Despite our numerous menu modifications, all our orders came out perfect. Parking is easy, location is great...This is THE breakfast spot for us when we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! I got the breakfast burrito - monster style and my boyfriend did the border bowl. We both left feeling like that was one of the best breakfasts we had! 

Mimosas were great and staff was attentive & thorough."}
{"text":"Good spot in a great location.  I had an omelette with tomatoes, pesto and mozzarella, and my companion had chocolate chip waffles.  Both were great.  Service was good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding and the day after....let's just say we were starving. While in town we kept hearing great things about the Breakfast Club. We called to see how long the wait would be and were quoted 45 minutes. It was only .05 miles away so we decided to walk in the sweltering heat there. Upon arrival the time wait was now 55 minutes, but bar was open seating.

We were lucky enough to get 3 open seats at the bar. The place was really crowded. I ordered the Huevos Con Masa and just thought it was okay. The corn bread was pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the poach egg and the potatoes that come on the side lacked flavor. The Chili dish it came with help spice it up a little bit, but I have had better. I'm a huge brunch fan so it was a little disappointing. I also had the breakfast soda mixed with pineapple juice. Again nothing to write home about. The staff was really nice and it was definitely pack! I would probably give this place another try and order something different if I was back in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy food when you can get it. It's typically packed for brunch - especially on the weekends. Most of the girls that work there are hot and young... that doesn't make them the best waitresses, but they are usually nice. 

The atmosphere isn't anything terribly special - it's basically just the place to go to be seen and people watch. It's full of the same douchebags and plastics that went out the night before - they still look like their hair gel and guyliner is holding up and their designer shirt maybe has one or two extra wrinkles. The ladies seldom look like they left the house unshowered or without makeup. Mostly pretty people anyway... I always feel like a disgusting mess when I'm there because I just roll out of bed and go dirty.

The food is fairly delicious, but I think it's pretty difficult to fuck up breakfast. It's not excessively greasy though which is nice... There are many breakfast favorites that serve greasy meals. Their standard eggs, bacon, fruit, bread, and hashbrowns is very light as well as filling. Their omlettes are slightly above average. 

It can also be rather inexpensive here which is nice for the $30,000/year millionaires. It can also be fairly pricey depending on what you get... it's the drinks - that's where they get you. They are priced like mixed drinks, but it's just orange juice or coffee. 

The problems with this place are that it's tough to find a seat, you have to keep your appetite while eating around douchers, and there are half a dozen other breakfast places within a few miles of it that are as good if not better. I do like this place though and I'll continue to go... food is 4 stars, ambience is 3, service is 3.5... this place really gets a 3 and a half. Go check it out."}
{"text":"I came for breakfast, obviously. After a short wait, we were seated outside. The outdoor seating is very nice, but when the sun is hot, it can be uncomfortable as the shade is a little awkward. Anyway, the food: the fresh squeezed orange juice was really good. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, but they simply didn't stack up (ha ha) to the quality of pancakes I get at other breakfast restaurants. They were on the dry side and a bit too bready. Needed to be drowned in syrup to improve. They also could have used more blueberries. Based on the pancakes I received, I'd say there are better places to get breakfast. The Breakfast Club looks and feels more upscale (and has prices to match), but you're better off with your cheap, diner-style breakfast."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating for breakfast was great.  Food came quickly and was delicious.  Great waitperson too"}
{"text":"I really like the feature Of being able to put your name on a wait list. So that when you get there your table is waiting for you. Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a little bit of a wait but it wasn't bad.  Our breakfast was delicious.  I had the Burrito with chorizo and it was a bit spicier than I typically care for so I had to eat with care.  Had I liked really spicy food it would have been great.  The french toast looked amazing and my son said it was very good.  All in all it I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent breakfast place.  I was in town for business, and I came here three days in a row.  The first day I had Huevos Con Masa, the second day was Huevos Rancheros, and the third day was a Quick Start of eggs and bacon.  I was always surprised at how quickly my food came out (about ten minutes).  They were all excellent.  The servers are all pretty and cheerful.  The only small complaints I have are the exhaust from cars on Scottsdale Road I smelled sitting outside (not the restaurant's fault), and the fact that a server short-changed me the fraction of a dollar on my bill.  I'm a 20% tipper, but when she did that, I reduced her tip accordingly.  All in all, a great place for brekkie in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great!!!!!! Service(Mark) sat at the bar greeted by Mark and took the time to ask my wife and I name and to get to know us. I am sure he noticed that we come to this place a lot.   

Order was fast and before we left he offered to top off my ice coffee. Thanks Mark. 

Tell Mark this : ice coffee Breakfast club and Hot coffee Hash Kitchen. He will know what I mean and who wrote this."}
{"text":"I think this my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale so far.  The Bloody Mary was super spicy and pretty dang strong. A little bit pricy though, $10 for a pint glass. I also had an iced Americano that was really good.  So I never order pancakes out because I don't usually like them but I was really in the mood. I got the sweet cream cakes just plain with butter and syrup on the side and seriously I think they're the best pancakes I've ever had. Also the presentation of all the dishes is so lovely it's almost hard to dive in to them! 

I have to comment though that the service at the bar wasn't the friendliest I've ever experienced, but really that's the only negative."}
{"text":"This is a cute brunch spot.  It seems to be popular, but the wait for an outdoor table at noon on a Saturday was only about 30 minutes.  

The hostesses and our waitress were very professional and seemed to know exactly what they were doing.  We lacked for nothing and didn't wait for anything either.

I opted for the breakfast burrito. The description said two eggs, but this bad boy was huge!  It was also a good blend of flavors, especially when a little hot sauce was added to the mix.  I neglected my poor potatoes because I wanted to experience as much of the burrito as possible.

We easily split the check between the three of us and were  our way. A very pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Very modern place. 
Good food. 
Had breakfast:
-Potatoes ok. Could have been cooked more. Not great. 
-enjoyed variety of dishes. Had proteins, fruit, & veggies. 
-Hollandaise sauce ok, but tasted too much like cheddar cheese. 
Noise level: Loud, but great for noisy kids like our kids.  
-Service good. Nothing above & beyond. 
Overall, good, but not awesome!"}
{"text":"PANCAKES! everything about this place is the best. I eat here more often then I should."}
{"text":"2nd time here & still very good. It's a very busy weekday breakfast place w/ communal tables a la Le Pain Quotidien wannabe.  Had a little Greek yogurt w/ berries & oatmeal w/ side of raisins & brown sugar."}
{"text":"It's no great shock that breakfast rocks my culinary world, and The Breakfast Club rocked it, socked it, picked it up and dropped it! 

I built my own omelet with spinach, mushrooms and turkey sausage folded into 4 light and fluffy egg whites. It was definitely way more omelet than I could chew, but it was cheaper in the end than doing a two egg omelet because it came with potatoes and fresh fruit. Everything was cooked to perfection: Flavorful, but not too heavy for an early morning meal. I washed everything down with some tangy grapefruit juice, which I'll say wasn't as good as I can squeeze at home, so save your $2.50 and perk up with a specialty coffee bev from the espresso bar."}
{"text":"Fun, vivacious & lively atmosphere in a great location - the food and coffee were subpar - nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good... I enjoyed my breakfast grilled cheese. There definitely could have been more seasoning but a pretty standard breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, ordered a breakfast grilled cheese, mixed berry pancakes and an iced tea. The breakfast grilled cheese was amazing! Wish that the waitress's mentioned that the pancakes are each the size of a normal dinner plate because you have the option to order one pancake as opposed to a full order which is three. They were good though, however the berries are just thrown on top of the pancake and not mixed into the batter. Iced tea wasn't good, had an orange slice in it and tasted old. Atmosphere is very loud hard to hear the people you are with.  Service could have been better. Waitress seemed like she didn't have time to take our order or provide proper customer service, it wasn't overly busy so unsure why that was. I would consider going here again, as the food wasn't bad but probably wouldn't do this for an outing with family or friends as you can't really have good conversation here l."}
{"text":"Probably about the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had in my life! The \"large\" is a regular sized drink, it's sour and just not good at all. Skip this!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad me and my girlfriend tried this place out! I had a mushroom omelette w/ onions. Tomatoes. Spinach. And cheese. The omelette was definitely full fulling! (pretty huge) and delicious! Along with the O'Brien potatoes, they use green and red bell peppers that gives it a kick out of  it!  my girlfriend had the banana waffles with a scoop if ice cream on top.. Very good too! Hits the spot for a sweet tooth! 

Over all the food was good! A little pricey but its worth it! Definitely will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast, brunch or even lunch. The Breakfast Club is a trendy little restaurant located right in Old Town Scottsdale, so be advised that this isn't the place you come looking like crap after rolling out of bed.  Be prepared for a long wait too, especially on the weekends.  But there are plenty of guys and girls to spend your time looking at, so that might help the wait go by for your table.

I've had the breakfast burrito and the veggie omelette- both were delicious.  They serve them with potatoes and fruit, but you can rarely finish everything because the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. We been here couple times and we will come back here for sure. Good food, good service. Hot servers :) They always busy and our food came after 10min! That was unbelievable. Even if you have to wait for a table it's worth it to wait because service is very fast. One thing I didn't like - honey cup was so sticky and dirty, I feel like you should clean before you bring it ...."}
{"text":"The menu is thoughtful and the house decor offers a cohesive gesture of casual. Tv's and charming booty butts everywhere, kinda like any given home that offers good food, tv and a honey combined for a gratifying result. 

My stomach was rumbling this late morning so I ordered up the BLT with a fried egg and a side of sweet potato fries and water. A solid meal that came in at $8. I was in need of a relaxing moment to fuel up with a sentimental meal that would ease my mind and uplift my spirit. 

The guys and gals delivered."}
{"text":"This breakfast was well worth the 45 minute wait for a table. I had the Quick Start Loaded which was delicious. I love places that don't use a grill lube that you can taste. Potatoes were good and the 9 grain toast was tasty. The service was quick and I appreciated seeing how quickly they cleaned and reset tables - it really kept things flowing."}
{"text":"We ended up at this place when we tried to hit Over Easy at 11:45 on a Sunday morning and were told they were closed. Bummer! 

Didn't want to wait in line at Matt's and had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Took the trip down Camelback Rd. to The Breakfast Club. 

The wait was pretty decent for a Sunday morning in the middle of old town Scottsdale. The host was friendly and helpful and seated us at a communal table with plenty of room between us and the other couple that was seated there.

I started off with a cup of coffee and my girlfriend went with a glass of fresh pineapple juice. Our drinks came quickly. The coffee was pretty great at this place. Hit the spot nicely. My girlfriend's pineapple juice was perfectly chilled and crisp. 

She came back to take our order. I went with the Mignon Benedict and my girlfriend went with the roasted turkey benedict. The food arrived pretty quickly, and my glass of coffee was refilled a few times in the meantime. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, despite the expected ridiculousness of some of the people that hang out in Old Town. 

My food was fantastic. The steak was still red in the center. At $13 for the sandwich, I wasn't expecting the quality of steak I got. My girlfriend's dish was actually even better than mine. Our waitress was fantastic. Definitely hitting this spot again."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast club. Its a super cute spot and the food is great!  I highly recommend to try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to every weekend. Their BC iced coffee is incredible and the eggs Benedict is good. Get there before 10AM if you don't want to have a wait."}
{"text":"Breakfast starts with fresh squeezed juice of your choice and the Orange juice is fantastic liquid sunshine! Today I had the Ham Bene and it is so tasty complete w potatoes and fresh fruit! Hubby had the best blueberry waffle yesterday . A comfortable walk from our hotel. We love it here"}
{"text":"Another NoWait experience where I walked into a busy restaurant during the heat of breakfast and was seated like a rockstar. All because I joined the waitlist on Yelp before leaving my hotel.

Breakfast Club gets crazy busy -- it's one of the few sit down breakfast/brunch spots in the area and, as a result, has a queue coming out the door between 9 am and noon. The servers are nice, the space is big, there's a patio, and plenty of healthy combined with not-so-healthy menu options.

As I mentioned above, I found Breakfast Club on Yelp, saw that they had about a 12-25 minute wait so I hit the \"Join the Waitlist\" button on the app and headed that way. It was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and by the time I got there plus checked in with the hostess, they had a table ready. It was just that simple.

Tinga Chicken Frittata is a very filling breakfast. For two. Except there was just me eating, so I only ate half. If only TSA would let travelers bring their restaurant leftovers on the plane, I would've gladly taken it to-go. Alas, I didn't want a full cavity search over an egg dish in a box, so I had to bid farewell to this big ol' plate of food. 

From \"front door\" (of my hotel) to paying the check, it was a 45 minute experience. With free wifi! Not a complaint from this one at all..."}
{"text":"This is a go-to for me when visiting Scottsdale. Cannot beat the food quality and the friendly service, always."}
{"text":"They have really good atmosphere and environment.
Good breakfast for family gathering. 
They brew their tea which is great. We had mignon Benedict , breakfast burrito and we love it. Not a fan of their side potatoes."}
{"text":"First of all, my best friend and I came here on Sunday when there were floods in Scottsdale so we thought, \"holy hell we have to eat outside.\" 

The wait was about 20 minutes, but very worth it. I had to use the process of elimination to choose my breakfast because all the options were to freakin' die for. I decided the get \"The Bird\" which is an omelet with Turkey, avocado, mushrooms and Boursin cheese. The plate also came with delicious potatoes and fresh fruit. The portions were huuuuge so I'm glad I didn't cave and get the side of pancakes too. Ouch, that would've been painful. 

Overall, the service was great, the food was greater and the stormy weather made it all so much better. This is definitely a place to try at least once!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, great staff. Worth a wait. Drinks are very well made and the food is spot on.  Great place for a boozy brunch or something with the family. Good music but not too loud for conversation."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my dad. I had the huevos con masa which was 5 stars--poached eggs on jalapeño cornbread with a spicy chorizo \"queso\" on top. It was definitely spicy which I really liked. Our waitress was less than enthusiastic but I can't really fault her for that--seems like a busy spot. Service nevertheless was super fast and we were in and out within 30 minutes. If you want something more relaxed and slow paced this may not be the spot, but for our purposes it was perfect."}
{"text":"We loved the counter seating and the food was delicious! The restaurant? itself was busy, but the staff was able to turn tables quickly. The server was nice and the fooddidn't?t take too long which I was surprised considering the place was full."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great waitress who definitely knew her stuff, rest of staff was beautiful to boot as well."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a long time and I finally got the chance. There was a long line and they dont accept reservations. The portions are huge. The service was good. I think you definitely get the quality and taste you pay for. I ordered the huevos ranchers and I really enjoyed it. I love their fresh juices as well."}
{"text":"Loved this place for a hearty brunch after hiking Camelback! We did a call ahead situation and still had to wait on a Friday morning - dang. Luckily, the wait was not long and we were seated shortly after we all grabbed a coffee for the wait. 

I love that they serve fresh squeezed juice to order, and promptly ordered a grapefruit juice, which came in a gigantic glass. I also ordered an omelet with tons of veggies. It came with a small mountain of homefries. I added avocado on the side. This was a ton of food but I killed the plate and was satiated for hours. 

My only gripe is that the check was placed on our table when we were just about halfway done our meals. The standard \"no rush!\" was directed our way, but I definitely felt a little rushed nonetheless. Our meal was paid for before I was even done eating! Aside from that, great spot."}
{"text":"The struggle was real. I came here on a Sunday around 1:00pm, thirsty, hungry and desperate for replenishment from my binge drinking fiasco the night before.

Usually, when I'm hungover food tastes extra amazing, so that doesn't bode well for this place because I left feeling underwhelmed. The omelet was just okay, nothing special, same with the potatoes it came with. I didn't even touch the fruit. 2 small glasses of OJ ran me $8 bucks! 

All things considered I've had better omelets at Denny's and at a cheaper price so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This uber-hip breakfast place is definitely built for Scottsdale-ites looking for a great breakfast in a beautiful place. The staff is attentive and prompt; you can clearly see as you enter that the vibe is deliberately established by the management to attract dealmakers for power breakfasts and early meetings.  
    The food was quite good, and doled out  in generous helpings, but a highlight was  the potatoes O'Brien, which I would recommend you try, no matter what else you order.  
    At the right time of year, I'm sure the outside seating would also be amazing, but the fact that it was Arizona in August prevented me from sitting on the sidewalk.
    The prices seemed about on par with an IHOP, but the ambience was much cooler, and the entire dining experience was more enjoyable.  (I'm not bagging on IHOP, just saying this place has a different feel- one that I enjoyed more.)
     All in all, if you're up early enough in Scottsdale, and looking for a good meal, this could be a good choice."}
{"text":"I really like this place! My boyfriend and I are from
New York and we are always seeking places that have a sense of urgency and The Breakfast Club definitely has that. In addition to that, they try to use more wholesome ingredients in their food than other places. They also have good coffee and decent prices. The area that it's in is pretty nice as well and it's just a great place to be for brunch."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food! Long waits on weekends unfortunately and slow service too sometimes. I've had pleasant results with the french toast, breakfast burrito, egg white combo (forgot the name of it - a healthy start?), and most recently, the biscuits and gravy. Definitely tasty and I will be going back for brunch."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant . The server Michelle was so rude and disrespectful from the moment we sat down . She was condescending and confrontational. After she ignored us she decided to argue with us about the lack of tip she received. She flat out said \"If you're not going to tip don't bother coming back\". I was so upset and hurt I asked to speak to the manager and she walked away from me . On our way out I found the manager and told her what happened and she dismissed it too. Never ever am I coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a leisurely weekend breakfast...just don't make it too leisurely if I'm waiting for a table, okay?  Every time we hit The Breakfast Club we end up waiting; but it's worth it.  You can always wait in their coffee bar...but good luck as that's always packed too.  I love their Eggs Benedict with the spicy sauce and smoked salmon (can't remember the name of it).  They also have  a board with daily \"specials\" and list some great breakfast burrito options...my husband has gotten pretty creative with his and he loves them every time.  I don't suggest going here if you are in a hurry or have somewhere you have to be in an hour...it's just unpredictable.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"J brought me here for Sunday brunch during my first trip to visit him in Scottsdale. Cute restaurant for brunch, pretty tasty food, and fairly decent prices, though service does leave something to be desired. Also, substitutions are pretty much out of the question.

I had the Whole Wheat and Honey Cakes with Vermont Maple Syrup and Butter, with a side of Applewood Smoked Bacon. So simple, yet so delicious. I was in quite a happy state after eating this meal. Full, but oh so happy. I slathered on the butter like there was no tomorrow and full enjoyed my fatty fat fat meal. 
Boyfriend had traditional eggs benedict which were ok, not the most amazing, but still pretty good (note: I don't eat eggs so I have no idea how the eggs were, but I thought the rest of it was pretty good).

Overall, the food was pretty good, so I might come back here again for the pancakes."}
{"text":"Very good fresh breakfast many healthy items to choose from. Very busy place if you're in a hurry watch for a seat at the bar its first come first serve. We walked in and sat right down when there was a 45 min wait for a table. Very clean. Excellent service. The woman that was sitting next to me asked for a diet coke and the waiter told her that they only served coke in a bottle because they didn't have fountain soda. So she passed on the soda and just asked for a water. The waiter took it upon himself to go next door to another restaurant to get this woman a diet coke. Now that's service. Above and beyond."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast in beautiful Scottsdale! The food portions are huge, and delicious! They make their own vegetable juice which I wished they sold in stores. Overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"Almost 2 hours to wait... one hour wait and one hour wait on your food... I was bored I had other things to do... the food was ok but if you wanna wait two hours of ok food be my guess... honest true"}
{"text":"Good food, a bit pricey. Definitely has some high class clientele, but it's not a dressy atmosphere. I like Butter's in Scottsdale better for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here had the border bowl. It was amazing .. The service was super fast and friendly. A place you must stop to visit if you like breakfast."}
{"text":"Very complete, and tasty, breakfast menu. Lots of options depending on your appetite. The best restaurant coffee I've enjoyed outside of Hawaii. Noisy, and peak season probably spells disaster for parking, but these are minor complaints. Overall a really fine place my family dined at three times during our stay in Scottsdale. Go there!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic..... just moved out here from cali and have been trying to find a great breakfast spot. Well after 5 months we have finally found out sunday spot. I had the basic french toast. Which was amazing and my hubby had the lean green omelette that came with hashbrowns and fruit. The only down fall is my french toast only came with french toast. I had to order eggs and bacon on the side. Their coffee is outstanding and i am a hard critic when it comes to my iced chai and they were spot on. Our waitress Victoria is incredible. Even though they were busy she still came by at the right times to check on us. Even gave us some to go coffee before we left  i would highly recommended  this place if you are out in the scottsdale area. Parking is a pain but well worth it. Thanks Victoria!!! We will be by to see you again."}
{"text":"Great People watching and good food in oldtown!"}
{"text":"High quality food, wonderful atmosphere. A little too busy on Saturday/Sunday AM. Great location right on Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. The atmosphere isn't terribly inviting but the food is off the hook. I ordered the huevos rancheros (comes with black beans, shredded lettuce and green chili verde). This monster was BOMB. Mr. Muscle ordered a breakfast burrito bowl or something like that. Verde, hash browns, eggs, it was delicious too. These are hardy meals that actually packed a great flavor. Pancakes were very good - had some flavor and chew to them. Excellent place for breakfast - highly recommend. 2 meals, coffee, milk and side of pancakes about $27.  Worth it. Service was great. Also serve all kinds of fancy smoothies, coffees and alcohol based breakfast cocktails."}
{"text":"My first experience to the Breakfast Club.... eh.  There are much better places to eat breakfast for the price.  We often drive by and see it crowded so we tried it on a Sunday morning.  Our server was very helpful, but the food was nothing to write home about.  Much prefer Butterfield's, Taylor's, or Cafe ZuZu (favorite) for breakfast."}
{"text":"The potatos are sprinkled with fairy dust (or perhaps a healthy pat of butter) with a nice punch and multiple hued bell peppers.  I ordered the chipotle laced hollandaise on the \"traditional\" eggs benedict.  On the menu they'd mentioned the virginia ham - and it was worthy of special recognition.  My friend had an omlette - every bite oozing with cheese.  She raved about the potatos as well.  
All in all - LOVED IT! Loved the name, loved the minimalist decor, loved being close enough to walk off the cholesterol coma with a brisk walk through beautiful old town Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Went on a friends recommendation and couldn't have been more pleased. I ordered the waffles Banana's Foster, it was to die for. Love this place and I will go again. P.S. I drove 50mins just to try it. It  was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Has the usual variety of egg dishes, pancakes, omelets, etc.  The wait can be long for weekend brunch.  If it gets longer than 20 minutes, I would just go somewhere else.  It's obviously very popular, but not in a trendy/hip way - more of a classic way.  It's a good place for families."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich. It was delicious. Big enough to split, since I don't eat big breakfasts. For a breakfast place, I was kind of expecting a bigger menu. However, I'm not that let down since I liked what I ate. I really like that there is alcohol here for a day I might come back with friends for mimosas with brunch."}
{"text":"Grabbed the kids for a late breakfast at 10a on a Friday, late March. 1 hour wait, with a bustling atmosphere, outside waiting area, Scottsdale friendly, ordered orange juices, milk and Mexican coke. Order of chocolate chip French toast, chocolate chip pancakes, waffle and breakfast burrito with Pork verde. Short wait for food, kids happy at arrival. Burrito was large and not overly spicy. Potatoes were pretty good with precooked peppers on the soggy side and not crisp. The burrito was average taste and nothing extraordinary. Kids enjoyed their meals, decent price point for quality. Second time eating here with about the same experience."}
{"text":"Our hotel, and our friends suggested this as THE spot for breakfast. I am so glad they did, in fact, we came in 2 mornings in a row we liked it so much!

The hubs had a breakfast burrito one morning and a Mexican scramble the next - both awesome (and HUGE). I opted for my usual classic egg breakfast and then splurged for banana pancakes the next day. By far, some of the best pancakes that I have had (shhh...don't tell my mom).

I loved the decor of this place, and with all the windows & high ceilings it's really bright and airy. Plus with their tasty coffee (which they offer to fill up for you to go) it's a great start to your day.

The only thing I would say that they lacked is effective hostesses, (which is common) and the service was a little slow when it came time to pay the bill. Other than that absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"There's always a long wait here but you'll fit right in on a Sunday morning jumping out of your Escalade or Mercedes, geared up in full lulu lemon, running up to the hostess stand to put your name on the list as your boyfriend parks and then you both stand outside starving for an hour, waiting for your name to be called. I swear I witnessed this exact scenario about 10 times in a row. But then after standing there for about a half hour, I looked down and realized I was one of them. Damn.

Oh well, the food is obviously decent, (it's really hard to mess up breakfast after all) but the people watching is even better. My favorite are the walk of shamers, stumbling across the street in last night's sexy outfit, high heels and smeared makeup only to turn back around after interpreting the situation and the wait time. Sometimes you just need food, I get it. I just happened to have time to get somewhat dressed."}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD, staff are super friendly! Parking is a little difficult. You also could wait for up to two hours for a seat, but most of the time, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress Shannon!!  My husband and I split the French toast and an omlette.  Yummy  The French toast is a must.  The atmosphere was special."}
{"text":"Omellete's are amazing; however the Mimosa's are over-priced. Also, you have to wait at a table in order to be seated. They really should serve people at the tables inside of having 6+ tables designated as waiting tables.

Basically you have to wait at a table to get a table. Sounds pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"A native of Scottsdale, this establishment BELONGS here.  
Great service. Fast. Friendly and healthy.
A little noisy inside, but they have \"mist machines\" outside if you can handle the heat."}
{"text":"Went this morning for the first time for a meeting with one other person. Wanted to sit at one of the high top tables to have some privacy and be able to speak without people close by. Was advised there's no service at these tables. They had us go to the counter and order carry out. Ok, we did and explained we would be eating there. So, instead of bringing out food out on plates. Everything was packed in individual plastic containers. Between, the omelettes, toast, fruit, etc we had 6 containers in two plastic bags for over $38 w/o tip. The restaurant was very nice and clean. For 8am on a Monday morning they weren't packed. Kind of surprised they wouldn't have gone out of their way a bit.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Typical Scottsdale! 

It felt a bit pricy, long wait to get a table, and just did not come through on the expectations.

The ambiance was nice and cozy for a breakfast nook but after the long wait in line my pancakes were not up to par and the coffee was burnt.

Although, I would recommend it for tourist because of the location. It's good, just not great."}
{"text":"Love this place, short wait on a Sunday. .friendly staff and great food! Not to mention they have mimosas! I came here a while back and they seemed tight and cramped for brunch...now I can tell they've done a renovation that really opens everything up and accommodates more. Well done BC!"}
{"text":"Fast service, social atmosphere, amazing breakfast! 

Originally was looking for a place to drop in and eat breakfast but stayed a bit longer due to the friendly wait staff who made me feel so comfortable and welcome. Additionally, sitting at the bar enhanced my experience. Everyone around me was friendly and outgoing. 

No better way to start a day than with positive vibes all around!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! 15 mins to get a drink after being seated and there wasn't a large crowd. The cokes are pay per bottle and not fountain drinks. Go across the street for music and great food at Montauk. We left after paying $12 for drinks at Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews that the service and food are both fantastic. Considering how busy they, the BC  is able to churn out satisfied customers and that includes me. My friend and I arrived and 10:10 with people waiting and by 10:15 we got a table...the key is to tell the hostess that you want the first available table and poof...! Voila..

My friend got an omelette and I got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon. I also like  the fact that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. Our server McKenzie was very pleasant and the food came out in no time. Prices are moderate considering what we ate."}
{"text":"Plan on having a long wait... If you're okay with that, \"The Bird\" omlette with turkey, avocado, and gruyere cheese is oh-so-good! Not a very thorough review... but I only order that dish (don't want to ruin a good thing)."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Great atmosphere. Got seated (for two) immediately. Very very friendly waitstaff. 
Breakfast choices (breakfast grilled cheese) was great. We will return for sure. The beautiful morning and open air dining was perfect."}
{"text":"Unlike the movie, this place isn't about good times and making new friends and memories (actually I haven't seen the movie so my plot description may not be accurate). This is a popular contemporary diner where you can expect a wait, and correspondingly lots of noise and bustle with the people.

For food I had an omelette and chocolate chip pancake. The chocolate chip pancake was the best thing here and was loaded with chocolate chips inside and out. One on the side was a great deal and a good splurge from my attempting to avoid sugar. On the other hand, the omelette was just average. There were a decent portion of ingredients but it seemed kinda sloppily cooked and the eggs weren't fluffy but had too much of a burnt crispy texture. The side of potatoes was too oily for my taste and unfortunately a lot of oil seeped over to the side of fruit. While the portions are generous, I'd rather have quality over quantity.

Come here for the pancakes and coffee, the proteins are sadly disappointing."}
{"text":"Ahhh...a restaurant with a name right out of the 80s. Bestow my heart! The BC as the regs call it, caps the end of little strip of shops in Oldtown Scottsdale. It is the Hugo's (West Hollywood reference) of Scottsdale. Lots of eye candy for boys and girls. The staff is mostly women, and quite the hotties they are. The space is very uncluttered and has great views of the passersbys and cars whippin' down Scottsdale Road. The oatmeal (add blueberries) is fantastic. The breakfast burrito is muy excelente. Orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and the coffee is strong and robust. Just like my Aunt Helen. The place is packed on the weekends, so expect a wait. Truly a hot,  hip spot on boulevard I call Snottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place!  Food is fantastic and service is outstanding. I personally like the Border Bowl but everything is good.  The place is usually busy but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"High energy place for breakfast or lunch! Usually there is a waiting list to get in. I have waited ip to half an hour. There is inside and outside sitting, however the outside is literally the narrow sidewalk so you get people passing by your table all the time. Good quality food. One big inconvenience is the lack of parking. You may have to park far and walk to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nicole Weepy: New Manager at the Breakfast Club who treated me like a criminal seconds after seating me; telling me I have to get up from the table because my friends were not with me at the time that she sat me. I mentioned that they were across the street closing their tab and she continued to threatened me with a 5 minute window. I am a very easy going guy and completely understand policy to not sit someone if they don't have a full party, however, she made the mistake of being disrespectful to a customer in front of many other customers. A customer and a waitress (not even mine) apologized.  Note: My party of 3 waited 1 hour for a table. 
Food was great 
Servers were great
Manager: Well you get the idea
Quote of the day - \"Well if your friends aren't here in 5 minutes; I'm going to have to make you leave\""}
{"text":"Second time in 3 weeks where we had horribly slow service.  We have been longtime customers (8+ years) but the last 6 months have proven to be a bust... not only is the service bad the the quality of the looks of the staff have even dropped off... (my wife was the first to point that out)"}
{"text":"I came here twice, but I have to admit that in both times the food and the service were fantastic! 

The decor is really modern and fresh, and they have a coffee bar, which I love. You can sit there and order coffee while you wait for your table (if they are busy). Also, the hot regular coffee is to DIE FOR! I am usually picky about coffee but this one really hit the spot. 

Both times I ordered the lean & green omelet, which came with a side of fruit and potatoes. I was able to make two changes to my omelette with no problems. Everything in that dish was SO yummy and tasty! The omelette was fabulous, and the potatoes were made with red & green pepper and I loved it! 

I'm sad to read some of the other reviews, so I suppose we were lucky to get very nice waitresses both times! 

I would love to go back and order some waffles or pancakes. I would totally recommend them."}
{"text":"I love both the food and atmosphere of the breakfast club in old town Scottsdale. I usually order pancakes, bacon and eggs with fresh OJ. This place is always super busy since its pretty small (and popular) - so be prepared to wait at least 30-45 minutes (which is sometimes a pain). Delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"I had the best Huevos Rancheros ever this morning. Green chile pork with black beans, onion, tomatoes, etc all over scrambled eggs. AWESOME."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! 5 days in Scottsdale and we are breakfast here each day. The service is awesome from the moment you walk in. You will probably have to put your name on the list as there seems to be a wait, but well worth it. The servers were all very friendly and had great suggestions for things to try. I even ended up sitting next to someone who used to be a server there and she still comes in for breakfast often. She made some wonderful suggestions. This place does not disappoint and will be a favourite whenever I visit. Keep up the good work Breakfast Club!"}
{"text":"TBC has become a bit of a Scottsdale landmark over the past few years...I use it as a navigation landmark when I have people meeting me in town.

\"Go north on Scottsdale Road and if you see 75 hung over people dressed in Affliction tee shirts and sequined mini-dresses, standing on a street corner waiting for a mediocre breakfast, you've gone too far...in so very many ways\".

I live (for another few weeks, at any rate) pretty close to TBC and yet, I don't really \"go to there\" very often (or at all) if I can avoid it.

I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.

In addition, the food and service have left me cold (much like my last omelet at TBC a few weeks ago) on my infrequent visits.

But the amusement factor provided by TBC is (for me at least) quite high, and for that, I'm grateful!

I've been twice in the past year...once for lunch, out of renewed curiosity (I was headed to another spot for lunch and saw a couple reading a menu outside another restaurant and discussing their lunch preferences in loud Scottish accents \"I dinna want a fookin TACO, Angela...I wanna go to the fookin Breakfast Club!\").

That was almost a year ago...and I went once for breakfast, recently, because the Beautiful Carin likes TBC.

And what Carin wants, Carin gets!

But both visits featured mediocre food (esp. for the price) and mediocre service (at any price).

My last visit also featured an apparently broken exhaust duct that runs under the booths at the north end of the place.

Hot, humid cooking exhaust, coming up through the seams in the upholstery, steamy cooking aroma's wafting around me from below...I was about to call Guinness because I thought I was setting a new world record for sustaining a fart!

But the aromatic breeze didn't stop! 

And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!

Our server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old \"model\" (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!

Maybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.

At any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?

It wouldn't be fair!

TBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that."}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing! We went on Sunday before labor day with a large group (bachelorette party) and were seated without waiting too long, and the waitress split all our checks with no issues. The restaurant is clean and the style/decor is fresh. The food was yummy-- one of the best smoked salmon bene's i've had. the pickles in the bloody mary are also yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast burrito! Staff is friendly and helpful. I here on business and plan to visit any time I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Used to live here. Jessica at the bar likes goofing off while the others all work very hard. Orange juice very delicious love the turkey Benedict"}
{"text":"Great food! I was with a large party and they accommodated us quickly, everyone in our party enjoyed their food. We were slightly complicated because we each ordered 2 or 3 drinks but it was no problem for the server! All in all it was great!!"}
{"text":"Probably my fifth time eating here..  It is definitely becoming my favorite breakfast spot..  The menu is simple yet complex in flavorful choices.  I always get the Turkey and eggs combo and it is always great..  The waitresses are great, I am not a chatty person and they are always good at noticing this..  I just want to read my paper or play on my phone and not be bothered at 6 or 7 in the morning; they seem to get it.  I will definitely continue to return thru ought the week as I have not been disappointed yet..  Thanks BC staff, keep up the great work.."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service very little wait with online checkin. Noisy inside so we sat outside.  Im looking forward to going again soon for breakfast!"}
{"text":"So we get here at 9:30am and there's a 30-45 minute wait. 

I figured being from out of state (SoCal OC) I would be impressed with a really original menu and what all the fuss was about with this place. 

Well, I haven't got my food yet and I want to warn the non locals to not be quick to think the breakfast club is anything special. 

Overpriced drinks. Mediocre food. Cute servers. But that's the extent of it. 

Should have tried Almo Cafe which is more in line with a real breakfast joint. 

And the Bloody Mary was all show and no taste. Thanks for the chewy celery stick. Such a major disappointment. 

And the food was \"eh\". What a waste of our morning. Denny's would have done the job, cost half as much and not taken 2 hours. 

But hey, they have the young, cute, college co-ed girls dressed in tights if that's what you're looking for. 

Shake my head how I ended up here."}
{"text":"Hate the wait, hate the prices but I love the Breakfast Club!  The food is amazing and the menu is extensive for plain old breakfast food.  The portions are large which is great if you are starving or hung over but I wish they had some of their larger items like the omelets ala cart.  I love their a la cart breakfast sandwich, it's like an adult egg McMuffin with horseradish sauce on it.  I don't love the price.  At over $5 for just a sandwich I'll head to across the canal to Olive and Ivy's market and get a sandwich and home fries for $7.  And if you like pancakes?  O....M....G!

I have found a couple things there that aren't wallet busters if you just want a quick bite to eat.  Their 2 eggs anyway are $2, spend $0.50 to add cheese and you have a filling but cheap meal for under $3.  The portion size is more like 3-4 eggs instead of two when you get them scrambled.

If you want to look at the menu ahead of time, don't bother with their online one.  It's out dated and most of their items have risen in price $1-3.  The other bad news is they don't have an alcohol licenses so no mimosas or bloody mary's with your breakfast.  Womp Womp :("}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. After this experience I don't think I will ever return. Today I sat up at the bar and had the unlucky draw of having Wade be my server. He really does not know customer service and has no knowledge of what a regular means for business. He completely turned me off of this place. He was not friendly, he made me repeat my order 3 times while he was putting it into the computer (still came out wrong). When my food came out he asked me how it tasted while I was in the middle of my first bite, he did not ask if I needed anything else I had to ask 2 different servers that weren't even behind the bar for silverware and hot sauce. Additionally he dropped the check while I was still eating(nobody else really was at the bar so I don't understand the rush)  he also wanted to charge me an additional 4bucks for a Togo Arnold Palmer that I have never had to pay for the 50+ times I have been there before. He said it was new policy or something. Either way I think he should see the value of someone who frequents the place over double charging someone. Regardless I will not be back I would rather give my breakfast business to a place like snooze, matts big breakfast or even daily dose!"}
{"text":"We had Brekky here on Sunday morn. It was a small wait which I filled the time enjoying the awesome Bloody Mary I ordered. The Egg Benedict was the best ever and I loved the Obrians. I recently moved here from Seattle WA and am a Chef who has been in search of a fave place for breakfast, I think I found it. It is a noisy bustling place so you have to be able to hang."}
{"text":"Great, go-to brunch spot. I've been here several times. Maybe it's because my boyfriend and I get up so late on the weekend that we never have to wait for a table? 

I've tried several things on the menu that are meat free-some better than others. Love their omelettes! Yum. The Bello Bene is so-so, I'm a huge fan of portabella mushrooms but I think it was the Bourdelaise sauce that threw me off. I've ordered the quick start breakfast as well, and the only thing that irks me is getting charged extra to sub out the meat for potatoes. WTH? 

I like that they have a coffee bar, an option that I have not yet taken advantage of-due to it being far too much work to think of a fancy coffee drink I would like when I'm not fully awake. 

Service wise, I've never had an issue. The waitstaff is always friendly and I've never waited a really long time for food. 

Overall, it's a great place to grab standard breakfast fare and I predict many more visits to BC in my future."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting Arizona ... Came across the breakfast club. This place had Amazing quick and Fast service .. And they have one of The best breakfast places I have ever ATE..  

 You must stop by here if You visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!!! I had the burrito with chorizo and my fried had \"the bird\". Adrianna was our server, and she was awesome. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the Bird Omelet and the Turkey Benedict - tasty and flavorful - they are more than amazing! Nice and friendly waitress, cozy environment, plus the breeze - nothing could be better for a family brunch at this place."}
{"text":"This place is between 3 and 4 four stars. I'm not dying to go back but I definitely would try it again ~ nothing \"bad,\" just nothing to get truly excited over (yet.) Portion size was good-large. Egg sandwich a great value w/some very delicious bacon. I love when chefs add a twist ~ chipotle to hollandaise ~ however this combo didn't work for us. Husband is a finicky eater (I'm certainly not) but both of us hard a time on that hollandaise. The menu has a lot of other great choices (check it out) so that's a plus.

I did enjoy my chai tea. Just a milk was $3.50. Food is reasonably priced; drinks are at coffee bar prices.  

BEST THINGS: our server did forewarn us of hollandaise so we got it ~thankfully~ on the side /  good service though busy and mostly with a smile. Definitely goes a long way to bringing me back for another go."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes. The Breakfast Club looks so CUTE and DELICIOUS on the outside. and there's all those happy people eating on the tables out front. WHAT COULD GO WRONG? 

ok ok ok so I went in pretty hung-over hoping to get a Mimosa to numb the pain a little but they don't have booze. We should have just left but the group figured that \"ehhhhh we're here we might as well?\"

K so then we go to our table and the waitress takes FOREVER to come to our table and offer us water. Wait for water? Really? In Arizona? Does that seem right to you? Bring us water! Right away! Thirsty people are unhappy people.

Anyways just to torture us our waitress is all over the table next to us and those customers even go \"oh we get the BEST service here\" while we are sitting are there all unhappy without beverages and food. suckey.

K so there's that u know which was not really cool. Then I mean the food comes. takes a while which isn't really shocking consider the lag to just get us water and coffee. I ordered 2 eggs scrambled with some feta cheese [my idea to add in cause I'm creative]  along with some nice thick bacon and some fruit and toast and shizzz. It was all ok, I mean I didnt order anything to crazy. There bacon was very tasty though.  All my friends that I went with got way more exotic breakfast stuff then me but I dunno it all looked a lot better then it tasted- which was a let down. Everything was just kinda blah. I mean my order was sorta blah, but the non-blah orders still tasted blah. BLAH!

I just... yeah. I just really wasnt that impressed. I'm trying to think of something nice to say besides the bacon was good and the oj looked tasty. I got nothing, 
All in all Breakfast club was kinda expensive for what it was [mediocre food] and it was just, forgettable...."}
{"text":"I had the beef hash for breakfast which initially was very tasty but developed a sort of sweet taste which was odd.  The potatos were very good and the fresh orange juice was great."}
{"text":"I called ahead to arrange a table since it was Sunday brunch. I was impressed with the text notifications that was very nice!

We arrived and waited for less than 5 minutes to be seated. The service at the front desk was marvelous-the young hosts were cheerful and eager to greet my guests and I. 5 stars to the front desk.

Our server Kelsey asked what we (4 of us) would be drinking - girlfriend answered \"water,\" 1 of my guests answered \"water\" and before I or my friend could say anything -server walks away. Eventually we get to order drinks when she comes back.

Shortly after, we all order our food. The wait for the food was short! Wonderful. The food comes out- server approaches the table-not to ask if we are enjoying our meal-if everything is delicious-no the server came to the table to bring us our check and ask how we're splitting it. It came across as impolite to all of us. No one asked for the check, so I asked her to take it off the table. We just receive our meals and the serve is already trying to flip the table? It ruined the experience. Server did not inquire at any point if we were enjoying things.

I had ordered the Huevos En Masa but server ordered me Huevos Rancheros instead. I'd never been there so I didn't realize and I ate it. When the check came out was when I saw.

We were visiting from across the country. We wanted to enjoy brunch and the service at the table disappointed each of us. I would come again to give the place another chance - but a very disappointing first time eating there."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast bowl it was amazing and the service was awesome yes it was very busy but the wait was not long and the waitress was very attentive I will definitely come back maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"2011 is gonna be a real banner year!  This place has a little bit of a wait to get in, which is a good thing.  Great service and the food is good too.  Plus it has a great name!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast... huge menu, yummy adult breakfast drink options, fun atmosphere, great service, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Good food, snobby staff... nothing outstanding about this place."}
{"text":"Delish!  Fantastic bloody mary and an excellent bene breakfast! Wait wasn't too long and managed well.  Server was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! A little over priced but the service is great and so is the food. The last time I came in, they were close to closing but still were very accommodating and provided great service!"}
{"text":"Went in around 2:30 to eat they lied said the card machine wasn't working just so they can close early. Bad Business to be in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Quickstart breakfast of 2 eggs,2 strips of bacon, cranberry bread toast 
(sooooo yummy) and fruit for $5.99. Can't beat it'"}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out last weekend, and I am so glad that I did! This place is great overall. We sat outside on the patio, and it was fun people watching and looking at the cars going by. I had a mimosa, which was a bit pricey at $10, but it was in a huge class and was very tasty. My dining companion had a Bloody Mary--also $10 for the big size--which he enjoyed. The coffee was very nice as well.
Following the recommendation of my server, I chose the Cinnamon Challah French Toast. It was SO good! Unlike some breakfast places, where you only get a minimal dusting of toppings on your french toast, my plate was loaded up with candied nuts and blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. It was well worth the $11 because it was a HUGE serving. I think it came with 3 giant pieces of bread.
The service was really great, friendly, and attentive. I can't wait to check this place out again. There are lots of other items that sound tasty, and they also serve lunch."}
{"text":"Sorry but there is always a wait here but you'll just have to get over that because this place is so frikin delicious! They serve pancakes with ice cream on it!!! Ive tried the cherries jubilee and bananas foster pancakes with the honey wheat pancakes I believe it is and bananas foster definitly better but it depends which you prefer because both were fan frikin tastic.  (im sure only like 5 calories too right??, ha ) And I have also had the eggs benedict with the portabello mushroom on it (don't remember what it was called) I dont eat meat so I get it with out it and with out the other sauce it comes with, but still get the hollandaise and man, its good! It has a little spice to it and I love spice.  The iced green tea is yummy also. The servings are big so you can always order to share (or if you cant decide, order a couple things and  share everything) When the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. All in all, love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a local gem. While on a trip to Scottsdale had breakfast here two days in a row. Love the fresh squeezed juices and they make a mean cappuccino.  Had the cheese and mushroom omelette the first day which was good but not a lot of taste. The second day had a veggie scramble that was fantastic.  Be prepared to wait as this is a very popular place."}
{"text":"I ate here once and we still talk about it. We stopped here on the way from the airport to Mesa. I've never had a fluffier pancake in my life. The benedict was amazing. The fruit they serve your food with is fresh and delicious. The portions are great. The coffee is good. Seriously, we joke about driving to Arizona just for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club was a great choice for eating breakfast on our stay in Arizona. Our party of 6 went in a busy Saturday, but the BC was on top if it's game. The coffee bar was great for while you were waiting for a table. When we ordered and got our food, it was tasty and delicious. Everything was great for breakfast, even the drinks from the bar. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I had an amazing breakfast here yesterday.  If you don't have a lot of time, call ahead and ask them to put you on the list.  It's THAT busy....and why not?  The food, the service, the environment ~~~ All incredible.  I had the heuvos rancheros and my buddy had the heuvos con masa.  We both got a side of applewood bacon (done your way) and jalapeno biscuits.  The portions were large and in charge, but so good that I couldn't put my fork down.  The jalapeno biscuits were not spicy, but the flavor of the pepper did come through well.  I did have to spice up my huevos a bit, but that's because I'm addicted to hot sauce.  Next time I'm in town, I HAVE to try their mimosas....the waitress made at least 50 while we were there (we sat at the bar).  

The Breakfast Club is a must!!"}
{"text":"Amazing OJ - freshly squeezed. I first ordered a mimosa and then had to order just OJ because it was so good. I got the lean and green omelette, it was good but needed something to elevate it. I like a little kick so even some red pepper flakes would have taken it to the next level. My husband had the Border Bowl and it was full of flavor, every bite a little different. I think it became his go to dish. The Huevos Con Masa has a lot of flavor but had only one texture, it could have used some crunch. 

All the juices are fresh, the salty dog with fresh Grapefruit juice was perfectly balanced. Coffee was good. There is typically a long wait, you can put your name on the list via Yelp or in person. If you find yourself waiting you can order a drink (coffee, juice, mimosa, etc) and enjoy while you wait."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. This place is not excellent. Middle of the road breakfast place with all the traditional arizona plates. I had a traditional eggs Benedict. Not bad, definitely not awesome. Maybe I had the wrong dish and eggs Benedict was the wrong thing to order... Maybe everyone is here to look at hot chicks in spandex. No idea. But this is your average snobby Scottsdale breakfast place with the value just not up to par. You can do better. But if you want average over priced food. This is a place for you!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately welcomed. I ordered the house Bloody Mary and unfortunately, I wasn't impressed one bit. However, the food made up for it! I ordered the bird omelette that looked like it had a whole bird and avocado inside. The portions are huge so I wouldn't recommend kicking your plate clean. My brother ordered the border bowl and my oh my was it tasty. There were so many flavors in the bowl and it too was a large amount. I need to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Really great find and a 3 min walk from the W Hotel. We sat on the Patio and just took in the early rays and service was really fast and efficient. 

They make fresh smoothies and juice drinks as well as my Cafe Latte was amazing. Food is fresh, healthy, and good sized portions."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the food here due to the mixed reviews! Recommended by my Inlaws and well worth it! Apparently in the summer months no one is busy in Scottsdale so we came in about 9:30am and were quickly seated by a cheerful server. I ordered the grilled cheese breakfast sandwich which was absolutely amazing. No complaints at all! I ordered the mimosa which tasted like only oj, meh. I ordered a side of fresh fruit and it was delicious and ripe slices of watermelon, honey dew, cantaloupe and pineapple, mmmm! I had a great experience here, I hope you do too!"}
{"text":"at a friend's suggestion we tried this place out.  it was a mere 35 miles from our home in Anthem!  We were so happy we made the trip.  My husband has been dreaming about the pulled pork since our visit!  I loved my breakfast and the coffee was the best.  We are going back to meet the friend that suggested it this week.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I only go here when my family or friends from out of town come here to Scottsdale...I believe it has to be the fact that I want to bring them to the best place to eat breakfast in town.  This is the place, people!  I can't stop thinking about those Huevos con Masa and the fresh fruit it comes with."}
{"text":"Whoaaa, before I dive into my review, do the women that work here have to meet a certain \"good looking\" quality?  I don't think I saw one woman here that was not good looking and they were efficient with our order...Welp onto the boring stuff ha.

I really enjoyed the environment, it had different types of people enjoying there tasty breakfast.  We arrived before the rush and I was well pleased with our food.   I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, the fresh 
strawberries and almonds were a nice touch.  DEF COMING FOR MORE Ha."}
{"text":"Great and maybe best iced coffee and latte.    Clean fast and while we only had coffee I would go back for breakfast"}
{"text":"Absolutely not disappointed in this place! Fanatic food and service. Food is OUTSTANDING...we had the boarder bowl and the banana fosters French toast...was out of this world. Fresh squeezed oj, good coffee and love the fact the patio is dog friendly. The best part is you can be put on the \"waitlist\" on Yelp so you don't even have to go and put your name on the list ..BIG BONUS POINTS there! We will absolutely 100% be coming back to enjoy the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Awesome food!  We dropped in Monday mid-morning.  The best eggs benediction I've had in the USA. Their fresh squeezed V18 nice is gray (just needs some vodka). My kids had waffles and when the server brought over a free-pour bottle of syrup it made their day.  Not like other places where you get a tiny little serving of syrup that disappears into the waffle."}
{"text":"Great place in downtown Scottsdale at reasonable prices. Outside seating is awesome and the green chili was fantastic. Would definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try the Breakfast Club during Spring Training but it is usually pretty slammed. Not the case on a Saturday morning in December at 9:30 am. I like the interior and we sat at the breakfast counter. Quick food!!! It was also delicious - good coffee, and my husband had the biscuits and gravy while I had the wild mushroom omelette. Who doesn't love fresh melon on the plate in December! Also, the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was absolutely fabulous. Served in a frozen glass made all the difference. Service was ok.....and as a tip, to really feel like you fit in, make sure to come straight from the gym still outfitted in your yoga pants/workout gear."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent except the coffee.  Didn't seem to match the quality of food."}
{"text":"Consistent, quality food - we enjoy going there about once a month!  Special note to early risers, they open EARLY so you can avoid the weekend crowds."}
{"text":"Get something with chorizo in it! I had the Wild Hog omelet and it was great. Use Yelp to join the waitlist early, usually a size able wait."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. A little too posh for my taste and just a tad bit $$ for French toast but excellent quality and service."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Beautiful upbeat staff to sling breakfast with a purpose. Love the hours!  Personal favorite is the health conscious breakfast - egg whites, fresh tomatoes, broccoli, cottage cheese and fresh fruit. It never fails."}
{"text":"We were originally going to grab something real quick at Einstein's after our hike at Camelback, but I saw this place and asked about it.  I jumped out of the car to find that there would be a 40 minute wait, and we were up for the wait.  I hear that there can be an hour long wait or more at times.  I was already warned about the people who come here seem to be overdressed for brunch, and it was true to their word.  I love that we were there in our exercise and hiking attire.  We did get some coffee from the coffee bar area in the back.  They have excellent coffee here.  If you are a coffee snob, you could fall in love with the java here or some eye candy around you.  There was a healthy stack of papers near the coffee bar, and we waited outside until we were called in for our table.  I was told that we were lucky that we had the nice waitress.  They are all really pretty.  I decided on an eggs benedict a la crab meat style and asparagus.  It was quite delicious.  It had a orange red color sauce with a hint of spicyness to it.  If you are a crab lover like myself, this is something that you would appreciate.  It also came with a side of fruit.  They have very limited outdoor seating and our waitress was pleasant, which I hear is not usually the case.  The prices were reasonable, and I wouldn't mind coming back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Theresa was the best!!! The food was delicious and the entire staff was so sweet.  I highly recommend coming here for a quick bite to eat.  I had the BLT on sourdough with sweet potato fries.  Made our bachelorette experience so great!"}
{"text":"If you are missing some real southwest chili flavor check out their southwest items.  Their homemade hot sauce is the real red chili deal!!!
Pancakes were phenomenal and the service is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Brilliant, and possibly my second favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale now. The food was exceedingly yummy, the service was excellent, the price was totally right on, and it's in the middle of town. What's not to love? I did ding it a star for the 25 minute wait we had to get in, but consider that simple logistics... Be warned that this is a VERY POPULAR spot to eat, so if you want solitude, you're going to the wrong place."}
{"text":"MEH. 

One would think that this place would (and could) pay homage to the cult film, The Breakfast Club. But when you see the interior, you immediately notice how bare the walls are. The rest of the decor is plain and boring, too. This places looks like something you'd find in Terminal D of an airport. MEH. 

Service is spotty. My lunch date and and I ended up having to ask permission to sit somewhere, since nobody acknowledge our entrance and earnest appraisal - where do we sit? do we wait to be seated? 

The menu offers a range of things to pick from, though don't expect to be blown away by your options. They are of \"average\" variety. Sure, some looked intriguing, like the eggs benedict with crab. 

Of course, we had coffee. This would be, in my opinion, the best thing they offer. All I needed was a little cream and presto... the coffee was delish!

For lunch I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon, with a side of sweet potato fries. Of the latter, I ate about 20. Just okay. I ate 1/2 the sandwich and noted that I could have easily made this at home. My date commented that he was expecting his sandwich on dark marble rye. While the food was okay, it wasn't great. And considering I hadn't yet eaten all day (and this was 2 p.m.) you would think that an average sandwich would taste like the tears of Jesus by this point. Nope. It was merely MEH. 

I have no reason to go back here."}
{"text":"So my wife has been raving about this place ever since she and her friends ate here a couple of months back. Everything was fine until I asked for a diet soda. I was then informed that they only carry regular coke in a bottle. No fountain drinks?!?!?! Not coming back."}
{"text":"After putting my name on a list and waiting for 45 minutes the hostess staff made some random decision to just take my name off the list.  I started to notice that people that showed up after me were being seated.  Makes me furious that I wanted so long to just carelessly have name taken off of it.  Horrible waste of my Saturday."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this breakfast spot, and it's money every time. The food is great, the service is solid, and the drink choices are even better. If you're in Scottsdale then this is a must try for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here twice last weekend. I tried the lox salmon eggs benedict and enjoyed it. Then, I tried the waffles which were pretty good. It's a nice location and they also have mimosa's and bloody mary's for a weekend brunch. I'd like to come back here soon."}
{"text":"Not bad. I thought the cinnamon challah French toast was good - big portion covered in fresh berries and nuts. Jalapeno biscuit was pretty good. I would skip the chipotle cornbread. Hash browns had a nice mix of bell peppers and onions, which I liked.

Food was pretty good, not wow. I don't know if I'd make a special trip to eat here, but if I was in the area and the wait wasn't too bad, I wouldn't object."}
{"text":"I ordered the Quick Start Loaded breakfast, and overall the meal was delicious. I especially enjoyed the potatoes O'Brien and applewood bacon! The only negative comment I have is the scrambled eggs were over cooked for my taste. I will definitely order the meal again, but ask for the eggs scrambled lightly. Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and my meal was exactly what I needed. The coffee is the best! I came on a Friday morning so it was busy but I didn't have to wait for a table I just sat at the breakfast bar. Will return. :-)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast as usual...my wife and I have not been here for a year since we live on the East coast. The inside looks great since their remodel. Food is really good and tried the pork green chile this time along with the mushroom omlette."}
{"text":"I am here every other week to pick up breakfast on my way to the office. They have great quick breakfasts you can order to go. It's cheaper than the nasty Deli in my office building. You can't beat the prices for the \"quick start\" options. I am so excited they expanded the restaurant, the plentiful bar seating is perfect if you need to eat and go quickly."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club usually has long lines outside the window as you are going through Scottsdale Rd in Old Town Scottsdale.  I had a visitor in town, so I wanted to see what all the hype was all about.  The place is kind of small, so it has partial explanation of why it is so busy.  We came on Presidents Day, and I forgot that many people would have the day off.  The wait wasn't horrible, as we waited about 30 minutes.  While we were waiting, we had an opportunity to buy some coffee at the coffee bar.  

As we entered, the interior looked very busy.  There was a long table where we sat, and there was another couple sitting on the other edge of the table.  This is the first time I have shared seats with some one at a restaurant.

I ordered mushroom eggs benedict that came with potatoes.  My friend ordered a chocolate chip Belgian Waffle.  My food was good with decent portion, but my friend just got one small waffle for $8.  You could have gotten 6 Eggo Waffles for $4.  The quality is not comparable, but it doesn't make sense why she did not get eggs or potatoes.  We had a tough hike ahead, and it wasn't enough food.  I gave her the potatoes to fill up extra carbs and starch.  

I would come here again, but I don't think it lives up to the hype or long waits."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club is awesome. It's one in a handful of trendy little breakfast spots in the Scottsdale area. It's located right on the north end of Old Town, the area is really chill and perfect for lounging on a nice day. So if there's a wait, which there usually is... it's not a nuisance to hang out; it's a pleasure! 

Like a lot of Old Town Scottsdale places, there is a certain hipster vibe you get from this place. If you go for a later breakfast like we usually do, you'll most certainly notice that about three fourths of the people eating there are club-goers from the previous night that went to bed way too late and drank too much while partying. Most of them look like they have not showered since getting home the previous night, and smell like a ridiculous mixture of B.O. and cheap cologne. Not exactly our crowd, but it does make for some fun people watching. 

They have a lot of dishes that are more on the adventurous side of the breakfast spectrum, but also have all the tried and true's as well. We opted with the cinnamon challah french toast which was very good and an omelet which we just loaded with all sorts of good shit... it was also quite yummy. It's also cool that there is a little coffee bar inside that you can order from while you wait or get stuff from to accompany your meal. 

All in all, we quite enjoyed The Breakfast Club... it's just a fun and chill little spot to grab a fresh and tasty morning treat."}
{"text":"Had the traditional eggs benedict which was very good  with potatoes and fruit. Also the best wait staff ever. Always come here every time in town."}
{"text":"I expected great things about this place and was disappointed - maybe because we came for lunch instead of breakfast?   I ordered the BLT - probably my most favorite sandwhich - how could you mess it up?  Well, I will give props - the sandwhich was good - lots and lots of bacon, fresh tomato and lettuce.  the bread was typical nothing fancy there.   

I am most disappointed in the sweet potato fries - they were sooo bland - I couldn't even tell I was eating a sweet potato.  I ate ONE fry and not one more.  Just because sweet potato fries are so trendy doesn't mean everyone should try to serve them.   

The service was ok - nothing great - we had a table of 6 and it was the tail end of lunch, so the place wasn't busy.   the main complaint is that we were having a discussion about a friends dislike of eggs - when the waitress chimmed in and said \"yeah, I hate eggs - maybe because i work in a breakfast place and I know what happens with eggs\".....did I mention that one of us at the table was eating eggs???     Well she put her fork down after that comment.   Not so smart there....

I won't be going back - not because it was so terrible, but since it was so bland!"}
{"text":"Best BLT sandwich I've had. Unfortunately, The service was so-so, the only thing that kept me from rating 5 stars. 

Fresh squeezed juices are excellent, overall experience was above average and we would come back."}
{"text":"Great portions, lengthy wait.  Clean and yummy.  Would return."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because everyone else does but I personally wasn't impressed with what I ordered. I had the breakfast burrito with no meat and a carrot juice. The juice was FULL of pulp which I'm not a huge fan of and the burrito was stuffed with eggs which I'm also not a huge fan of. The service was fair. I did however really enjoy the fruit served with the meal and the banana foster French toast my friend ordered."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I'm from LA and know my breakfast well and BC is an awesome place for regular american breakfast.  Pancakes, Waffles and French Toast are awesome.  Eggs come out hot and cooked exactly as ordered.  Love the iced t!

Popular place with locals, so you will most likely wait for a table as it is busy.  

Wait staff is great, very efficient and nice people there.  

NO CRAYONS for kids tho, so just know that when bringing kids."}
{"text":"Weil it was my first trip to The Breakfast Club and I ate real healthy but I did oodle the Eggs Benedict and friend to the right of me ordered it and I was jeoulous. The Eggs Benedict looked \"Scrumdelicious\"!!!! I  had eggs poached with bacon and fruit. Great price at $5.95 and plenty of food for me. Bacon was not scrimpy but nice and thick, crisp and perfect!
Maybe as a reward for myself, after I finish running the 1/2 marathon, I'll eat a big breakfast on Monday. Looking to give it the fifth star it probably deserves. By the way, it's worth the wait....and you will wait at this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Highly recommend.   Biscuits and gravy was different then you'd normally see and very good.   My husband had the breakfast scramble and really enjoyed it. Large quantities so you'll leave full."}
{"text":"I'm giving breakfast club three stars because the food was good but not great. The service was wonderful and the ambience is diner style. I did not try any of their cocktails but they looked great and were decently priced!

The wait time on a Wednesday around 10am was about 10 minutes! I will go back but it might not be my first choice for breakfast in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy being told, \"I can't believe you're not tipping me more,\" by a blonde waitress in workout clothes (that obviously doesn't workout or enjoy her job), then this is the place for you! She took our order out of obligation and never came back to check on the table after the food reached us, yet some of our party of 6 still tipped over 25% of their bill. Before leaving, the waitress literally called out one of the cash tippers because her tip wasn't what the waitress wanted and told the rest of us to tip her more because she \"isn't working for free!\" I have never had an experience like this. The food and portion sizes were great, but the service totally negated that aspect. There are at least 3 other breakfast places in the immediate area that are better than Breakfast Club, and they have great service. I would give 0 stars if possible!"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time ever while in town for Spring Training.  The place was busy.  I ordered a Breakfast Bowl which was apparently pork with chile verde sauce on top of an egg scramble.  It was okay but nothing special.  I think that I could do better making something like that at home.

I also had a Bloody Mary.  I got what tasted like a Virgin Mary.  Very light pour of vodka.  I opted not to complain to my waiter because I didn't want the hassle.

I won't be back on my own accord but if I'm with a group of friends who would want to go,  I wouldn't object.  I won't be ordering the Breakfast Bowl or a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Second time visit. Both bad. Staff wants to be helpful, but wind up being pompous, not helpful and working with a kitchen that obviously defies the owners intentions. Distant and why they are so busy, I'll never know. Stay away."}
{"text":"Eggs scrambled with jalapenos! Need I say more! They were spicey hot and I loved them. I had the Belgian Buckwheat waffles and they were cooked to my specs ... crispy on the outside with butter to smother and it was heaven! Coffee was nice. Sun was warming us to a crisp while we waited but it was all worth the wait. You need to go to know!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast but overrun by Scottsdale hipsters.  Cute cafe with well prepared plates.  This is not a greasy spoon.  Beware of long lines on the weekend. Go early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"So, I've been to this place a couple of times.  It is currently going through a renovation, so things are a little tight around there.  It has not stopped the speed that kitchen works though!  I've been 3 times in recent months, and my food came out very quickly.

I'm giving this place a 3 because I probably will go back, but I was not happy with the way they do the wait list.  It appeared to me that they were discriminating on people based on the descriptions that they wrote down about each party.  I stood there and watched them for a while pick over some parties and then pick others with the same number of guests in the parties.  It was a little weird.  I want to believe that they were not doing that.  So, perhaps I need to get there on teh weekend at 8am or whatever time they open so I don't have to witness that.

Anywhoot, The Whole Hog is my favorite thing on that menu if you want to venture off the beaten path into the artery clogging.  When I have ventured into the high saturated fat realm, I have definitely enjoyed that option!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu. Friendly staff. This is a popular place, but you can add your name to the wait list right from Yelp. I had a mimosa and the French toast. Very good."}
