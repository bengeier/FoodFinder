{"text":"I order from Yen's pretty frequently.  I'll admit, the primary reason is that they deliver to my area.  I find the food to be exactly what I expect.  Decent flavor, decent portions.  I don't expect high-end gourmet from your typical Chinese take-out and I have been satisfied with everything I have ordered."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews unless I'm extremely satisfied/impressed or extremely disappointed. I wish I could say for Yen's I am the former, but unfortunately that is not the case. I am actually writing this review while i am still eating the delivery I just ordered. I wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE ordering. I was initially going to order from Wei Wei which has never disappointed, but I figured it was late and Yen's was close...my mistake. 

I ordered Chicken Lo Mein for my son and the General Tso's Chicken combination for myself. The same thing I always order. My General Tso's has the texture of a soggy, squishy sponge and it tastes like my first (and last) attempt at making my own sweet and sour pork at home. That was a complete failure. This \"chicken\" tastes exactly the same as that horrible experience with pork. I have three, dry broccoli florets and dry pork fried rice. I am, however, enjoying my egg roll, but that may just be the buyer's remore talking. 

I haven't tried my son's Lo Mein. I'm afraid.


*post-note: I have just tried the Lo Mein. I am a horrible mother for feeding this to my child; only Satan would feed this to a child."}
{"text":"So... I ordered for delivery at 9:13. It was quoted at being delivered between 10:10 and 10:20. Received a call asking me if I still wanted the food delivered at 10:30.. To be delivered in 30-35 min. When I asked why I received a reply of \"we are very busy... Do you still want food?\" Awesome!!! Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Have had Yens for many years and need to acknowledge them. Good price, always have leftovers, and quick delivery. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place might be good for ordering dinner at home, but when you are trying to order for a large group, forget it.  The last time we ordered from them for a large lunch, they screwed up the order.  Instead of giving us five PANS of food like we asked, they brought five individual meals, which was absolutely not enough to feed 20 people.  When it happened again yesterday, we were amazed and decided not to order from there again.

It's a shame because we had ordered large quantities of food from them in the past and never had a problem-- they must have someone new there,"}
{"text":"the food here is really great and really fresh and not over priced
the best thing is the vegetables are are so fresh, like they were just picked and cut and cooked up just for you
best chinese vegetables I've ever had"}
{"text":"I think I found my friendly neighborhood cheap Chinese restaurant!  (FYI: The sign on the awning says China Star, but the menu says Yen's and they say Yen's when they pick up the phone.  Not sure of the reason for the discrepancy.)

The previous tenant of my apartment left the menu lying around, and last night we were desperate for dinner so we decided to check them out.  Two vegetable spring rolls and two entrees cost less than $20 and were ready to pick up in 10 minutes.  (Delivery would have taken 40 minutes even though we live half a mile away.)  My boyfriend picked up the food and said the place seemed very clean.

The spring rolls were good and crispy.  The vegetable fried rice had more than the requisite peas and carrots - there were mushrooms, corn, and even zucchini, which I don't think I've ever had in Chinese food but it was pretty good.  The Mongolian beef was not just a pile of beef - there were plenty of onions and green onions to add color and texture.  Portion sizes were more than adequate and we both had leftovers.

The best part is the price.  The only entrees over $10 are the ones with seafood.  All of the lunches (with rice and soup) are under $5!  (Except for the ones with shrimp, which are $5.25 - still a good deal if you ask me.)

I would definitely recommend Yen's if you live in the neighborhood - it looks shady from the outside but I thought the food was better than Silk Pagoda's."}
{"text":"1.5, but I'm rounding down.

I ordered some crab rangoons and steamed beef and brocolli from Yen's. I am almost certain that one of the vegetables they steamed was rotten, because I had to spit it back out (it had a horrid sour taste to it). Also, the beef looked and tasted like rubber.... Overall, I was just very dissatisfied with the whole meal. I basically threw it out and for sure will not be ordering from this place again.

Some other negatives:
- The entire restaurant was empty. Because the restaurant is spacious, it made the emptiness seem that much worse.
- There is a sign outside the restaurant that states \"$5 for walk-ins\"... Ok, what the hell does that even mean? So, if I placed my order on the spot instead of calling in ahead, then does that mean that I would have gotten my meal for only $5? There needs to be some clarification on that! Plus, it made me feel pretty crappy as I paid more than double that for my shoddy (aka. sh*tty meal)."}
{"text":"well, i never write Yelp reviews but i feel i should!  and i should say i am generally easily pleased near everywhere i go.

this place would only do in a drunken pinch, and even then it's not a guarantee.  i could buy a frozen bag of \"whatever\" from the dollar tree and have it be infinitely better!

the food, as others have stated, is fake.  frozen, fried, sugary thick sauce, not hot.  soup served in styrofoam bowl.  it offended me. the waitress was nice, though.

on the plus, the broccoli was bangin and the place is SUPER cheap.  eat at Target across street."}
{"text":"Food so bad I had to throw it away! (was delivered).   Greasy, overcooked, and disgusting textures. No resemblance to the delicious Chinese food I am used to.

Don't say I didn't warn you .  ."}
{"text":"If you want a colon cleansing, eat here!

What a waste of my $$ and toilet paper,"}
{"text":"This place is awful.  It's always totally empty, and for good reason.  I went for lunch today since it's walking distance from my workplace, but I will never go back.

I got yelled at for asking questions about the menu, it took forever to get my food, the food wasn't that good--and then it made me feel sick all afternoon.  I got the lunch special with vegetables and tofu, steamed rice, and hot and sour soup.  It was all bland--amazing, since this restaurant is one of the few Chinese places that still uses MSG.

It looks like they used to do a buffet, but now the food tubs on the buffets are filled with old magazines and trash.  Not even kidding...I don't usually write entirely bad reviews, but I can't think of a single good thing about Yen's.

If it were the zombie apocalypse and I were locked in this restaurant, I still wouldn't eat the food.  Gross."}
{"text":"Unsafe! Do not order. First time we ordered was great. Second & third times were meh. Fourth time the garlic sauce was sour and has so far caused 2 days of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Decent food and fast delivery service.  The prices are great in comparison to many of the other Chinese restaurants around town.  Love the ability to order online."}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood restaurant and family-run.  The kids wait and do deliveries.

You will not mistake it for 'Plum' located a long block physical by distance and half a universe gastronomically.  But it is low priced and filling.

Is it fake?  I don't think so, but like many other Chinese restaurants across the country they order their menus from a central supplier probably in New York or California and pictures of food from that supplier/wholesaler as well.  So the menu doesn't have any mystery or excitement.

Since it's across the street from Target, this will give you an alternative to that snack bar or a place to fill up before you go to Kelly's."}
{"text":"I gave them 2 chances. Both times they messed up my order, forgetting or just not bothering to add string beans to either order, even when the meal said it came with them. 

I called and asked for a partial refund, and was denied. I was told \"already went through sorry\" and other such phrases in broken english. I'm not giving this place the privilege of a 3rd strike."}
{"text":"THE WORST!!! NEVER ORDER FROM HERE!!! We placed our order online and quoted 45-1 hour, after an hour 15 we called and were told the driver just left.... 45 minutes later (as we were calling to cancel) the driver arrived. 
The food was awful. Sickening, actually. We threw out most of it, only ate some bc we were so hungry. 
Wish I had checked reviews prior to ordering...."}
{"text":"My Fiance ordered here late last night because it was the only local place that would deliver. 

What we sampled: 
General Tso's Chicken (strange, the sauce tasted weird and it wasn't crispy at all.  We left it untouched and tossed it)
Pork Fried Rice (very oily with no vegetables, just a greasy mess only ate two bites before we threw it out)
Singapore Mei Fun (one of the best take out versions we ever had)
Crab Rangoon (decent, but not crispy)
Egg Rolls (decent)
Steamed Dumplings (gross)
Spare Ribs (another great version)

Overall if we needed another late night meal we might order from here again, but probably not."}
{"text":"this was some of the worst chinese food i've ever had. everything i ordered was incredibly salty. the tofu was not cooked very well and the fried rice, aside from being too salty, was rather bland. plus they didn't throw in any spicy mustard.

on the plus side, the food was pretty cheap, and the delivery was free and quick.

this place might be good in a pinch, but otherwise seek out better chinese options."}
