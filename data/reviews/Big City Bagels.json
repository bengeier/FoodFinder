{"text":"There aren't a lot of good bagel places in Scottsdale...,this place is ok but certainly not 4 stars.

Bagel quality is fair, not great. They're small and not full/shapely like good bagel places have.  They have a basket with old bananas and a small tray of muffins sitting out that's sometimes empty. The service is ok as some of the workers there have friendly faces.

Again, it's ok for a quick bagel stop but definitely not worth 4-star rating....which is what prompted me to go there in the first place."}
{"text":"I was never excited about bagels before in my life until Big City.  Now I look forward to sneaking over there a few times a week for one of their freshly made delicacies.  BCB is family owned and family run and the kids are just wonderful, hard working people.  

I know that they have specials after two for a dozen bagels and they look like they wonderful sandwiches.  All that I know thus far is that the quality of their bagels is second to none.  They are larger than the competitors and prepared better.  The coffee is great, and is self serve.  The store is clean and has about 5 or 6 tables outside so you may enjoy your day or take your dog along for a bite.

I never thought I'd be raving about something as \"blah\" as a bagel.  But BCB is so much more than that.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They microwave the eggs and meat and didn't have any bagels at left at 9am.  Won't be returning, though the service was ok."}
{"text":"Every time I stop here I am reminded of WHY I like this place. The bagels are fantastic; crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The coffee is good and the staff is LOVELY. . .always friendly and eager to chat with customers. I've purchased bagels here for events and every time I do I get compliments from guests. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in scottsdale.. Excellent coffee..family owned. Great service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town! They put toppings on the top and bottom of the bagels, so you taste the wonderfulness in every bite. Family run business - nice people!"}
{"text":"While on vacation, we stopped in for breakfast and had a fantastic experience!  The food was fresh, and the service was friendly and attentive.  My breakfast sandwich ingredients were high quality and of the same prices you would pay for fast food.  The coffee bar was extensive with different flavors, spices, and additions.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"I've only stopped in here once because I was running late for work and every other place in the area was crazy busy except this one.  Order an everything bagel, toasted with cream cheese.  I'm not sure where they came up with $5.92 for a bagel with cream cheese but I even said to the guy \"I only ordered 1, right?\"  Yep.  That was the cost.  That's double every other place I've been when in the mood for a bagel.  Sure, it tasted fine but I now have a better understanding of why they didn't have hardly anyone in the place.  Funny thing was they also had a tip jar staring customers in the face.  Here's a tip.... it's a bagel for pete's sake, price accordingly."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Great selection of bagels and way better than the chain bagel places here in AZ ( but not as good as bagels from back in NY!)

I really like that the bagels have toppings on both sides and they serve boars head meat...along with snapple.  Good place for a quick breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"In my constant quest to find good bagels in AZ I came across Big City and figured I'd give them a shot.  The bagels are great!  Again, the salt bagels here don't have the rocky salt that I'm used to but this place does a nice job.  The salt, everything, poppy and onion are delicious and they have a Hawaiian, which I didn't think would be good but I ended up loving it (it has coconut and I think pineapple).  The cream cheese is very good and they put the right amount on, at least for my taste.  I like the fact that these aren't the pale bagels you mostly see out here, these are crispy outside with a nice toasty brown color.

Husband loves the weekend omelet sandwich.  Convenient location and parking - major plus.  I take bagels to go each time and I freeze them - these defrost and toast up great, another plus."}
{"text":"Very good bagels and creme cheese.  Next time we visit the area we will be certain to visit again.  Try it, I'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy it.  Friendly service although I felt a bit lost as a newbie."}
{"text":"Authentic bagels that slap the silly out of posers like Chompies, Einstein's and many others. I will travel the 30 minute drive to pick up a few of these beauties on a Saturday or Sunday morning and be happy to no end. Funny, when I spool up \"Best Bagels\" from my address in Yelp, there are more than 40 entries before Big City. Feh!! Big City Bagels are the best in the entire Valley of the Sun, as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"After many visits, I'm disappointed that prices have been raised, yet portions are getting smaller. Loyal customers like me will not be returning. I ordered a bagel sandwich, and the deli meat was barely visible. Aftereards, the manager told me they used 2.5 oz of meat, which explains why I could barely identify the 2 slices on the bagel.  That's pitiful.  At nearly $7, I feel ripped off. The price would be fine, as long as they give you enough meat to justify it.  Even Subway uses more meat on a 6 inch sub. 

I can't imagine the cost to this bagel shop is more than a few quarters, for another ounce of meat. I'm sure their response would be to order the \"Skyscraper\", which is listed as twice the meat, for a higher price. But let's be honest, why should I pay nearly $10 for more meat, for a still underwhelming bagel sandwich. and really is the name Skyscraper even accurate, for 4 small slices?  My point is, please don't take advantage of your customers, as the smart ones will realize they're being ripped off, and not come back. The bagels are good, but nothing else is worth the money."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place 3 weeks ago and have gone at least once a week since.  The place is very clean, everyone is extremely nice, and the breakfast bagel I keep getting is bomb!!!  Best bagel place I have found since moving to AZ from WA."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! The bagels are pretty close to New Jersey and always friendly service. The only negative is that half the parking is gone now for a Chase bank being built, and parking was already an issue."}
{"text":"Just finished inhaling my \"Weekend Omelet\" Bagel Omelet Sandwich for breakfast here at Big City Bagels & Deli. This is my very first time visiting and I couldn't be more pleased with the experience.

The bagel sandwich was large and tasty, the service was excellent, the food came fast, and the coffee station is clean with numerous decent options. Pricing is also more than fair. I only paid $5.49 for my bagel sandwich. Well worth the price.

The interior is bright and very clean with plenty of colorful, informative signage. Plenty of seating inside and out, and Wi-Fi is free thanks to O.H.S.O. Nanobrewery just next door. I'd camp out here to work in the mornings, definitely.

More than anything, I appreciate the sense of urgency amongst the staff. Everyone here today has shown a distinct pride in their work and care for customer experience. Every one of them is full-speed ahead, and ultra-attentive to us customers, especially Omar.

The place has been buzzing with customers and pleasant banter ever since I arrived. Feels very east coast. I enjoy it here. If you've never been, I'd recommend stopping by. Their breakfast menu has been tasty and their lunch menu is extensive.

Good work, Big City Bagels! And good work, Omar! Thanks for a satisfying breakfast and for such respectful, fast-paced service. I'll be back.  :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot.  I'd say their prices seem pretty reasonable.  Everyone seemed quite friendly. I've been there twice and not disappointed. Manly for bagels and cream cheese but their sandwiches look pretty good as well. 

There aren't that many breakfast places left, and this one is one of the better, if not the best one."}
{"text":"Had The co-op sandwich (bagel and lox) here today and it was excellent! Great Java City coffee too. Happy to finally find a place worth driving to for our bagels and lox fix. This will be our go-to place for bagels here on"}
{"text":"This is for the bagels and the service. This guy perhaps Jared from looking at the family photo was helping me at the counter and had great charisma and was nice looking. He seemed to be making eye contact so I was feeling so special, but I think this was just his personality. He just smiled nonstop with a nice grin while we were waiting for our bagels. He even helped us carry our bagels to the car as our hands were full. Too bad I'm not from here, or I'd stop in all the time for the bagels and his grin. I'll remember him as my bagel man. O yes the bagel was wonderful too."}
{"text":"Great service, recommendations and food on point. Awesome place here and they just gained another regular. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast/bagel shop in North Scottsdale.

If I had to compare it to another local restaurant, it would be \"Lox, Stock and Bagel,\" but \"Big City Bagels\" is a big step up from them in my opinion.

The atmosphere is really fun, with cool little signs all around.
The staff is very friendly.
The bagel sandwiches are delicious.
Prices aren't bad at all.

My wife and I will definitely be back.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Big City Bagels is somewhere between a bagel cafe and Einstein.  They don't have all the trappings of a cafe (no egg salad, none of that)  but they do have nice normal bagel flavors and the bagels were slightly better than Einstein.  

They have a huge Snapple fridge which excited me, but alas, no regular Snapple.  Why is everything diet here?  I don't get it."}
{"text":"Typical bagel place, good selection of bagels, bagel sandwiches, and coffee. I've had the asiago cheese and the parmesan, both were good. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I know a great bagel when I eat one. These guys are the real deal. I love their bagels! They have great cream cheese as well, but if you really want to set it off, get yourself a bagel sandwich. They are mighty good. I love mine with some egg, sausage, cheese, onion, and peppers. Throw some ketchup on that and mm, mm you got yourself some boom"}
{"text":"I went back for another try at this shop and had a better experience.   The same staff was working.  They did a very good job and were very friendly.  That said, I was 1 of 3 customers in the building so it wasn't busy.   

The bagels tasted very good (one everything and a cheddar cheese).  The meal was excellent and I had plenty of time to read the paper in silence.   Once again, the hot coffee was excellent.  

I like this shop and will go back again.   I really like that it is tucked in behind a number of other businesses.  It's a bit of a hidden spot that is fun to find. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Been awhile, but whatever lettuce they are using needs to hit the road jack. It looks like parsley and has no place on any sandwich. Look at the photos. Otherwise, things are unchanged on prices and food quality."}
{"text":"Easy and fast breakfast:) i had the nova lex (bagel and smoked salmon) and my husband had the sausage burrito (lacked sausage but it was good).

Thanks for a polite service!"}
{"text":"Great Bagels and people were very nice. We will be back soon! Love the mom and pop feel."}
{"text":"Awesome bagel place. Fresh bagels with super friendly staff and a great bonus program: buy 9 breakfast omelette sandwiches get the 10th free!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. I am addicted to their lox bagel with capers. Most polite owners with such fast service. Quaint seating inside or out, sort of retro. Don't forget the punch card for free sandwich after 6 punches, you will definately want to go back."}
{"text":"My first time here and I got an Asiago bagel toasted with cream cheese. I can actually taste the Asiago cheese with every bite. The bagel is very fresh and soft. I definitely recommend this place.  I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Big City Bagels has excellent service and bagels to match. Each week I order 3 dozen bagels and the staff is attentive to any special requests. Thanks for the butter!"}
{"text":"Big City Bagels does a very nice job.

Now that Brooklyn Bagels (Desert Ridge) is closed, Big City is the only game in North Scottsdale.  They tend make what I call plump bagels.  In other words, you might not see an opening in the middle.  But they are great for making sandwiches and tasty too.

If you are an early riser, I would highly recommend coming here early and getting the bagels when they're still toasty hot.  The smells inside the store are amazing and don't forget to get your card stamped.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely in Scottsdale, but I had meetings all day.  I asked a coworker where to go for lunch and he made the suggestion we hit up Big City Bagels.  I'm so glad we did.  

I had a BLT Bagel to fulfill my bacon craving.  The bacon was crispy and there was plenty of it.  The sandwich was great, filling without being heavy.  The veggies were fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly and I was quite impressed.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back to Scottsdale for another lunch!"}
{"text":"Respectable variety of bagels and spreads.  My heart fell when I walked in and saw that the everything basket was empty, but I was actually in for quite a treat, as a new batch was about to be ready.  So I ended up with fresh, warm everything bagels - so delicious.  And I noted that the \"everything\" (sesame seeds, poppyseeds, etc.) wasn't burnt or falling off all over like at some other places."}
{"text":"HUGE portions! 
Refillable coffee.
Friendly service.

...and jalapeno cream cheese!

I love bagels"}
{"text":"Hungry, I ventured out to find Big City Bagels. I plugged the address into my new phone and headed out. 15 minutes later and I was pissed off and wondering if I had a retard sandwich for breakfast. I could NOT find this place, and kept being told \"you have arrived\" when passing an empty field. I looked online for better directions and still couldn't find this place, I finally decided to give up and head somewhere else when I exclaimed \"holy shit!\" I found it. 

The moral of the story? Their address of N Pima doesn't work well with GPS thanks to the city of Scottsdale changing the road but NOT any of the business addresses so here... 


Corner of Hayden and Frank Loyd Wright next to BedMart and Staples and 4 Peaks Brewery. 

Okay now I am over it.... 

I very much enjoyed the veggie sandwich on the onion bagel, everything was very fresh and very tasty, with drink and cookie it came to about $5.50 for lunch. Well worth it. I will go back for sure and have lunch."}
{"text":"Great bagel shop! I love their selection of bagels and sandwiches. They cater our business meetings on Friday mornings and everyone is always satisfied to see their smiling faces as they deliver them. I stop in occasionally for breakfast and they always remember exactly what I order. Amazing customer service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I like this place the employs are pleasant and fun .i walked in one morning .....first visit   Slightly hung over and hungry glad to see they had lox and cc sandwich . It was excellent"}
{"text":"Being from Tucson, I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend that lives up here. I have to say this is the absolute best bagel place I've ever been to. It's family owned and operated. The owners are very nice and remember you and what you typically order. The food is fantastic and there iced blended mocha drink is so good too! Every time I had to go back home I would crave this place. So glad I just moved up here as I'm sitting in the deli right now eating a bagel with garden veggie cream cheese and drinking the blended mocha drink. In heaven right now!"}
{"text":"Remember High School football when there was the A & B Freshmen teams? Well Big City is on my B Team. I go here when my top choice is swamped.

They have a decent selection of Bagels and assorted breakfast type sandwiches and sodas. There is a nice outside patio.

The major problem I have with this place is that they don't understand the phrase \"EZ    on the Butter\". Invariably I have to sponge off the extra gobs of butter from the Bagel. It must be a New York thing. Someone please pass me the secret code."}
{"text":"Great bagels.  I had an everything bagel with sundried tomato cream cheese.   Perfectly done bagel NYC style!  Not too chewy. Not too crunchy.    And that alone would be worth 4 stars.  But add in the clean decor, good parking, friendly staff and they are at 4.5 stars.  

But the thing that won my heart..... Java city coffee.  Oh how I miss thee from my days in Sacramento.  It's like this place blended the favorite places from my past. NYC and SMF. 

I'll be making the drive from chandler to come back here!  

5 freaking stars!  And some rock star hands.  

\m/ \m/"}
{"text":"I get the lox and bagel! We always get breakfast to go and enjoy it at home. Such a decadent and heavy weekend breakfast. I am usually the one at home waiting for breakfast so I can't comment on the restaurant itself but I love the food. If I am craving a bagel and have the time, Big City is my first choice!"}
{"text":"Seems like a good place to grab a bagel and a coffee before work. It's nice that it's open early. Not too many people there at all, so it was quick service.

I got a sub par breakfast burrito. My guess is that the eggs were microwaved - which is fine..just not what I was expecting. Maybe I had too high of hopes, but it wasn't a solid place for the breakfast burrito is was in search of. It got the job done though.

It's a knit picky thing, but I have to mention that my burrito wasn't actually wrapped up in the to go tin foil. It was just kind of smooshed around it. It's clear that it was quickly tossed together in all aspects.

I appreciate the service and food and I'll go back to give it another shot when I'm back in the area, but I will not be getting breakfast burrito next time."}
{"text":"I really didn't think there would be any decent bagels in AZ. Thanks for proving me wrong. These are true bagels that a NY native can enjoy. Interesting flavors too."}
{"text":"Ummm, if I could give this place 10 stars I would! I come in here every day almost (not good, right lol) but every time I get the best, fastest service ever! And everyone is so damn nice I just love the environment and the people. And the food....oh my! So amazing. I have no had one time where I was the SLIGHTEST bit unhappy! Namaste!"}
{"text":"Perfect little breakfast spot in N. Scottsdale. Fresh brewed coffee and ny style bagels really get me going in the morning. Try an Asiago or Cinnamon Sugar bagel; so yummy."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious bagels! I was in need of a bagel and wanted to try a new bagel place, I think I found my new go-to. My favorite kind of bagel is a salt bagel and their salt bagel is delicious! Not too much salt, just right. The bagels are also big but not too dense. Love it!"}
{"text":"Always super friendly staff here.  My egg and cheese bagel was very good.  It was nice to eat out on their small patio.  They have a good selection of various coffees."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for a bagel shop.  Made to order sandwiches and great variety of bagels.  I get the co-op and it is a generous helping of smoked salmon."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. They are my favorite bagels. Always fresh and delicious. The staff and owner are super friendly and get orders done quick. I highly recommend the salt bagel with the locks cream cheese, crazy delicious!!"}
{"text":"Really friendly folks serving up good breakfast grub and great coffee."}
{"text":"Real Bagel's start with boiling them!!!   Had an Egg'n'cheese on Poppyseed!   Great Bagel. 
Had a cup o tea too, my only dis was boiling water for tea was TO HOT.
I'll come again when I'm nearby. Yummy"}
{"text":"Great place! Great people! Awesome food! The White fish salad is perfect along with everything else they serve. Hope they remain in business for a long time.."}
{"text":"Delivery is on point, fast, easy ordering, never had a screwed up order in the 3+ years we've been ordering."}
{"text":"Great selection of bagels and super friendly staff. I love the fact that they don't dilute their whitefish salad with cheap fillers, like so many others do these days. They carry the Acme brand whitefish, which is my favorite and the best in my opinion. Their bagels are delicious. Their lox spread cream cheese is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Great Bagels! For a really long time I would hhave had to say that Chompies was my fav bagel... NO LONGER!

We went middle of a Sunday...and they were out of a few varieties, but what they did have were all very fresh and tasty.

We also took home a few of there blended cream cheese selections... also very good.

Stevie G gives Big City Bagels a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Real boiled bagels and the nicest staff on the planet.  I order bagel and lox everywhere, and theirs is the best I've ever had.  They don't skimp on the cream cheese like some places - they pile it on!  My husband and son like to think they are bagel connoisseurs, and I will say this place is definitely their favorite."}
{"text":"The best bagels in Arizona.   Delicious bagels and cream cheese fillings.    The bagels have a crustier outside and a soft inside.  
(not a hard crust)   They have fresh orange juice, great iced tea
and coffee.   You can sit inside or out.   If it isn't 105 degrees we sit
outside.    They also freeze great, and sometimes I like to toast them and put on lox and cream cheese.  Their lox is dellicious too.
A GREAT WAY TO START THE DAY ! ! ! ! !"}
{"text":"family run bagel place. Great bagels, good service. Quick turnaround. Their hot breakfast foods are nuked in the microwave, so don't expect great 'cuisine'... But their bagels are delicious and I definitely will go back there over and over"}
{"text":"Got here first thing on a Monday morning. Everyone was super friendly, and very knowledgeable about the surrounding area.  Anyway. This was the best bacon egg and cheese I've ever had.

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My most favorite bagel EVER is at Ess-a-Bagel in NYC. Obviously, I can't run down the street and get one of those whenever I want, so I'm continuously on the hunt for a substitute here in Phoenix. We decided to try Big City Bagels because it's close to our new house and I was hoping I'd finally find THE bagel. While it was good, it was nowhere close to my favorite (alas, I will have to keep looking). I did like that the bagels were small. While some may not feel the same way, I feel like bagels are already filling so with a smaller bagel I can get just enough of a fix ;)  

The lox tasted fresh, which is a good thing here in the desert, but the BEST thing about this place?? They have jalapeño cream cheese!!! Some bagel places have started carrying it, but not all, so I was happy to find another one that has it. It's the BOMB.COM!

Parking is a little scarce because it's at the back side of a shopping center and it shares the lot with OH-SO, which always seems to be packed."}
{"text":"This is the type of place we should support in the economic times we are in. A family owned and operated business with GREAT food, for a fair price, with friendly service. They dont hassle you will bull$#!t promotions like the major chains do. I eat here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Legitimately a great bagel/sandwich shop. Get the power bagel. Better than brueggers."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bagel in the area. And I would know cause I eat bagels everywhere all of the time. This is at least a weekly stop for me. What makes these bagels so delicious? I am guessing small batches. Once and a while, if your lucky, you can get one fresh out of the oven. No need to toast these! Their egg sandwiches are pretty good as well, but mainly because of their bagels. For any other bagel place to get 5 stars from me they will have to be as good at Big City."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It felt like a neighborhood deli which is what I miss from NY. The bacon egg and cheese bagel was delicious. When I go back next time I will give them the real NY test which is seeing how much cream cheese they spread on the bagel!"}
{"text":"Fairly average bagel sandwich place. Took about ten minutes to get our food after putting our order in, and I wish my bagel sandwich had a bit more mayonnaise on it. Coffee selection was nice and had great variety. Parking was sparse. Nice place to grab a quick average lunch. Definitely prefer this place to a Jimmy Johns or a Panera."}
{"text":"You're not going to do much better in the Phoenix Metro area.  Sure you can go to Chompies, but after 25 years, its nice to have another option.  They get my business when I'm in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A nice little spot where you can get a really good bagel.  While it's not the best that I've had in the valley, Big City Bagels is certainly better than any of the chain Bagel places.

Prices are really low, especially when you consider the area Big City Bagels is located.  I'll take $2.50 for a bagel with cream cheese anytime.  BCB also offers a good list of other breakfast food, sandwiches, and a decent variety of coffees.   It's a little bit hidden in that massive shopping center at Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright, by Four Peaks.  But when you find it, Big City Bagels is definitely worth skipping your usual chain bagel shop for."}
{"text":"Great selection of delicious bagels.  I love the Everything bagel with their yummy schmear of cream cheese.  The coffee left a lot to be desired, and okay, fair play - the name of the place isn't Big City Coffee... but I'd love the awesome bagel AND a great cup of coffee!  The folks at the counter could not be friendlier.  They are always really cheerful and seem genuinely happy to be there."}
{"text":"We dropped by here while in town a few months ago to get some bagel sandwiches for breakfast. The place looked pretty busy and we were on a tight schedule but the guys behind the counter ninja'ed up our 4 bagel sandwiches and some coffees very quickly while being super nice. We all enjoyed our sandwiches which were huge (I got an egg one with some veggies) and the coffee wasn't bad. Would definitely stop in again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bagels. I feel like im back east.  They have half priced bagels I believe after 2pm and close at 2:30pm  Im not positive about those times.  But go here you wont be disappointed and if you are you dont know good bagels."}
{"text":"Closest thing to NYC bagels out here. Makes me feel less homesick! Bagels aren't skimpy small like the ones at Chompies. 

Friendly staff. Great bagel selections. Wish they had more cream cheese selections. They have yummy cold cuts as well! They don't place a lot of cheese on their sandwiches so ask for a double of cheese. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after I found them on Yelp... Checked out the \"SPECIAL of the day\" and thought I'd pop in..  When I asked about the special I was told that they don't do it anymore. I said I saw it on the website. I was told that it needs to be removed.. Sooooo no special then.. Nope.. I ordered a sandwich and walked out.  I got a pastrami sandwich with Swiss and dressing on sourdough. Was very good. However, I'm not big in places that don't make things right. He could have honored it and moved forward..  Sandwich was 5 star. Service was 1 star.. Thus 3 star rating.. Probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"The bagels were chewy and delicious! Much better than the chains - husband had an everything bagel and I had a cinnamon sugar. Perfect after a long hike in the McDowell Mountains nearby!"}
{"text":"great options for bagel sandwiches.
came here for breakfast to fuel up for skating practice.  
ordered the ham omelet bagel.
they have egg beaters, meaning a nice protein packed sandwich with less cholesterol and fat.  
the bagel was very good and chewy.
very happy with the service as well.
friendly place."}
{"text":"Good selection of bagels and cream cheeses. My toasted Everything Bagel is so warm and soft inside - perfect!"}
{"text":"Ever since visiting New York City and eating at Ess-a-Bagel I've been in search for an amazing everything bagel with lox here in Phoenix.  We stopped to grab a bagel here and the location is perfect, but parking is a bit of a pain in the rear.  It get's a little congested during peak hours.  We placed our order which was made fresh as we waited and we received it within 10 minutes.  The bagel was nicely toasted and it came in two halves instead of pressed together like a sandwich.  I didn't mind, but there could have been a little more cream cheese on it.  the bagel tasted great, but I do miss those NYC bagels.  I would come to Big City Bagels again to get my fix."}
{"text":"Very good bagels compared to everything else that is around. I am from the east coast so I am used to better bagels than I get here in Arizona, but this is the best place around. I have gone here many times and have never been disappointed. I enjoy their everything bagels and cinnamon raisin bagels. 

I have tried one of their lunch sandwiches before, which was also very good. If you are looking for a good, quick breakfast and enjoy bagels I would definitely suggest going here."}
{"text":"Great spot that I usually visit when I'm in the area.  I like the fact they use Boars Head deli meats and I'll add that to a toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese for a few extra dollars.   Staff is friendly and food is consistently solid!"}
{"text":"The bagels here were worth the drive!  They are generous with butters and spreads.  The coffee was delicious and I liked all the flavored creamers that were already out without having to ask.  In the last hour of business they sell the bagels for 70 cents.  I would come here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Big City every Sunday for around a year now, and I have never been disappointed. Amazing fresh, soft bagels every single time. Every time I say to myself..... Not today.... But some how my truck makes a left into their parking lot and I'm ordering a bag of em for our staff or my usual 2 Cheddar bagels with bacon, egg, n cheese with two coffees to go or sit outside and enjoy Az weather. Great place, Great friendly staff, great coffee, an all around great place! See ya Sunday Big city bagels!"}
{"text":"Great food I'm a big fan of their breakfast burrito and awesome staff everyone is so friendly !!! Haven't had one bad experience at this place and theres never a long line :)"}
{"text":"Definitely returning next time I am in the area. New York style deli with excellent coffee to compliment their wonderful bagels."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in December. I had the \"city hall\" on marble rye and it was great for lunch. We went there today to get breakfast for all the relatives and bring back home. Pizza beagles, lox, omlette sandwich were all very good."}
{"text":"Great family owned business.  Best bagels in town! Big portions on fresh sandwiches at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I loved their bagels are so good! Once you try them you will not go back to the other chains. The service was friendly and very corteous. I had a dozen bagels to go for my co-workers and for my self had the french toast bagel. I must have to say it was delish!"}
{"text":"Decided to try after seeing the good reviews on YELP. Clean and welcoming interior.

Breakfast sandwich was good and service was excellent! Enjoyed the bagel - better than most in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"From a girl who was spoiled by NYC bagels for 20+ years, I have yet to find a better bagel in AZ.  Einsteins, Lox, Stox, Chompies and most other are chewier and tougher, but Big City, is simply a big, soft bagel the way God intended it.  It's a small, straight-forward, no-frills store, hardly a wait, nice people, low prices and they just make the damn bagels right.  You should try it if you like bagels. 
If you enter the shopping center from Hayden Rd. you'll find it right away, as the store is on the back side of all the stores on Pima; roughly behind Staples."}
{"text":"Sure beats Einsteins...The bagel and lox...not too shabby.  Bagels are a little more chewy than bready which is a plus!  Good coffee."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for a quick lunch one day and enjoyed the food! We each got a sandwich and each were fresh and tasty! Staff was friendly and welcoming too! My only suggestion for them is to have some sweet stuff out where we can see them because if I saw something sweet (and I know you have sweet stuff for sale) then I would have probably bought something sweet :) Oh and when the weather is nice this would be a great place to chill outside (they have a patio out front)."}
{"text":"Very nice people working there. The bagels are good but they sell out of many of the flavors sell out early"}
{"text":"I always order a cinnamon-raisin bagel toasted with butter, and every time I always complain that I wish there were more raisins in it!    It seems like at least half of my bites are just dough, no raisins.  But that is the only thing I could complain about!

The service is always fast in the morning and the people who work here are super nice.  I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great little bagel shop. Their bagels are always fresh, coffee is delicious, and their cream cheese is to die for! I stop in whenever I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"Came in from NYC to visit family and was hoping to find a decent bagel West of 12th ave in Manhattan. I have to say the bagels were way better than I expected especially compared to the rest of the bagel stores I've visited in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very tasty bagel sandwiches here.  Many coffee choices in the morning too, which is nice.  Prices reasonable.  Staff was friendly.  Parking good.  Not much more I could ask for."}
{"text":"Below average bagels. Eggs had no taste. Fast service."}
{"text":"Lox and bagel for breakfast was the best I've had in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Coffee was OK.  Only complaint, they need to drop the side on breakfast sandwiches.  That said, I'll be back."}
