{"text":"I have to downgrade Gabby's. After my last two visits I have to say the food should be avoided. Yesterday, of the three meals served to our table only one was edible. Coleslaw was brown and dry. Obviously days old.  I am surprised that the server allowed it to be served. The wings were hard and overcooked. We had a similar experience a few weeks ago.
I am not waiting for the third strike...I won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst service. Sat ourselves, because that's how this place works. Waited 10 mins. Not one person that worked there said hello or even acknowledged us. As the server passed us 3 times and then stood at the bar looking around. We ended up leaving. This is not the first time this has happened. Been happening for a few years now. Manager is a joke. She has ignored us on numerous occasions as well. No wonder the employees don't give a shite. I'm not sure why I bother going back. The bartender with all the tattoo's is nice tho. And that's the only reason this place gets one star from me."}
{"text":"Great service really friendly staff and great food 

Great place for any occasion or just any random weekend"}
{"text":"Yikes, the place is disgusting!  I wonder how they pass  Dinesafe?
I think I would prefer to eat in the back alley! 
Very trailer park!
I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they're attending to make a name for themselves as the world's smallest wings. I also asked to put rugby on during the world cup and the server struggled for about 30 mins to get the correct channel. I literally told her the correct channel it was on like five times."}
{"text":"Really.  Eat one bite from an over cooked meal send it back and demand payment.   WORST place on Kingston  Road.   Would not take my worst Fenway here unreal.   

Go to anywhere else.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Gabby's on Yonge Street north of Eglington when I lived in Toronto back in the late 90's...and it was really good. I had beers and wings here last night and I found it o be marginal at best. Service was good, beers were cold and the wings were just okay. The bathroom was filthy! The bill was $60.00 before tip for mediocre wings / fries and 4 beers. (Nothing special but there were plenty of tables and it was St. Paddy's Day) I guess that tells you something right there?"}
{"text":"Went here for half price wings on Wednesday. I've never seen such miniature wings in my life. Was really disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered wings with both ranch and blue cheese. We only got one dressing. Not sure which it was. Blue ranch? Meh...

Pace of service not so great. Mains came after we'd only managed to eat one wing. Fries were super undercooked. My husband ordered a fried chicken sandwich. It came out as a crispy critter. Sent it back. Second time, still extra tasty crispy (not in a good way). Gave up. Hubby ate all the wings while I was eating my main, so I guess it kind of worked out since he was waiting for his inedible chicken. I had the Mediterranean wrap. It was okay, except the wrap was burnt on one side. It has goat cheese in it, which was somewhat redeeming. Hubby said the wings weren't bad. 

Not a bad looking bar, but I wouldn't recommend eating here. Server was nice and took a percentage off the bill. She said the cook was new. Maybe he'll get better? Maybe if all you want is to watch sports, eat wings (without dressing), and have a beer, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Look, a Gabby's menu is a pub menu so you know what you're going to get. I stick with the staples at most of the Gabby's locations I visit and am usually satisfied. 
Burgers, nachos, wings & beer. 

As the Missus has relocated further East down the Danforth, this location is our closest and, in fact, the strip of fantastic pubs along this run of Kingston are our closest pubs altogether. 

So, this location seems relatively new as it has updated decor, all HDTVs, it's clean and well designed. The staff have been very friendly, engaging in conversation with us as I tend to do.

The best part of this store? They have the Super Sports Pack and KNOW HOW TO USE IT! So many spots that have the out-of-town games (and there really isn't many) are rarely on the ball when it comes to programming the sporting events. These guys, at least on all three visits, are all over it. Multiple NHL games from out of town, all in beautiful HD. Love it.

They have Golden Tee (oh how I use to love Golden Tee...) and a Megatouch Bar Game. Wing nights, promos during the Leafs games and Tall Boy Tuesday. Apparently they do a great job during NFL Sundays as well. 

This Gabby's is a go for me."}
{"text":"Popped in when the Feathers was full, and found this place lack lustre. I didn't have high expectations, given it's a chain pub, but really it was cold, slow on service and the wine was probably the worst I've had since cheap uni-days wine. It was dead compared to the Feathers, and it was clear why. Improve the drink and food selection/prep, warm the place up and speed things up."}
