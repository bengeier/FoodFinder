{"text":"Solid breakfast sandwiches. Pair it with one of their funky drinks (shout out to Club-Mate) or a coffee from Reunion Island and you've got the best quick breakfast on Roncy"}
{"text":"This place is my go to, as my boyfriend lives three minutes away. I'm not gonna lie I love their breakfast sandwiches. But only recently have their management, staff and \"house rules\" gotten slightly meaner and rude. They recently introduced a rule where the won't allow modifications. I asked them for no pickles and they're like \"sorry no can do we don't do mods on weekends\" in a b*tchy accent. I see the cook behind her listening in and putting four pickles on my sandwich simultaneously. This rule I assume is to curb the traffic but there were literally no other people in the line and it was as empty as can be. As I've been coming to this place since it opened, I would just appreciate better service. I might have to stop coming."}
{"text":"It's hard to say no to any food item offered out of a window. It just seems so casual and fun, and the convenience can't be beat.  So we walked up to the aforementioned window around 1:15 on a hot Wednesday and I ordered the Telway Burger (\"detroit classic, all beef patty, mustard, american cheese, onion, pickles\"). The dude behind the counter pulled a burger out of a drawer and I was immediately a little concerned. How long ago was this hamburger assembled, exactly?  My concerns were needless. The foil wrapping essentially steams the burger, and all the flavors wind up kind of melding together. The soft, pillowy bun works really well, though it is admittedly a little too big for the small-ish patty. (My first few bites were bread only.)  The concoction actually resembles a traditional slider more than an actual hamburger, but given that legitimate sliders are completely absent in the city, I am definitely not unhappy about that."}
{"text":"My experience at the gold standard breakfast sandwich takeout counter.   I'd like to start off thanking the English. They fucked up most things in the world that they endeavoured to do but they invented a hell of a muffin.  There is no breakfast sandwich without an English muffin. So to you, Queen Liz.. I solute you. I'm forever in your servitude.   Now lets get to the gold standard. Thats a hell of a name considering it could be argued that the real gold standard for breakwiches comes from under a certain set of arches. Also gold.  But I have to say that I am going rate my experience as a 9.5/10. Yes those are some Tonya Harding numbers, but the only thing broken here is the drive to roncesvalles. Why is Dundas always slow?  Theres NOTHING on it? I digress...  The sandwich - The muffin is perfect. I didn't know there coulee be a 10/10 muffin but there is. The mayo, the hot sauce, the PICKLES?! Its perfection. I order the one with bacon and the one with kale and ate both. Was the bacon one better? Sure but theres bacon in it. The kale one held its own much more than expected though. It was delicious.   The coffee shop was great too. Fast service and great coffee. They even had a rare flavour of Loop juice that my wife didnt know exists. Ha she's so silly. The only negative form the whole experience was that $6 was a tad high for a breakwich. But Fuck it, its beyond worth it."}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...  \"Traffic at the tiny window was steady while I waited. The guy rotated between handling cash and going back to the griddle to prep la nourriture. I'm all for multi-tasking, but I'm not sure if he washed his hands in between. About once every ten minutes, the would call out orders. People practically ran to the window to fetch their gold packages. I watched as one customer unwrapped his sandwich and sunk his teeth into the English muffin. The scrambled egg, melted cheddar, pickles, aioli and hot sauce dripped out from the corners of his mouth. It looked like a sandwich dreams were made of--striking a balance between greasy and glam.  Twenty minutes went by. The guy came to the window again and called out an order. Two people who had ordered after me went up to collect their gold packages. I was getting a little peeved. But, at the 30-minute mark, my solo sandwich finally arrived. I carefully folded back the gold foil, observed the thin sandwich, and took a big bite...\""}
