{"text":"Might not look like much from the outside but this place is great! Food was delicious, especially the fried mushroom appetizer! Even the black bean burger was great, a tough burger to do correctly! Sweet potato fries were also great!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!! Burgers are amazingly juicy and cooked to perfection!! Am very picky with wings and was pleasantly surprised with how good theirs are!! Always a friendly smiling staff and great service!! I've tried a few entrees too, all delicious home cooked meals!! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"The food and service from the owner himself was something out of Gordan Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. The mac n cheese was soupy and looked like velveeta with no bread crumbs or toasted cheese on top - too pricey for what it was, and it was the worst mac and cheese I've ever had. I'm not even that picky! The fish fry was over cooked and there was still big chunks of soft batter inside while the outside was burned. The fish itself looked and tasted odd -soaked in grease. It was inedible. I was never offered a warm up on my coffee, no one asked how the food was, or checked in on us. The owner just dumped off food and watched the baseball game. I flagged down another waitress who was very sweet and quick to put in an order for something else - I wish that she had been waiting on us the whole time. The owner came back to clear dishes, and he said \"You don't like our mac n cheese huh? It's not children's mac and cheese -it's prepared for adults.\" Clearly my palette was not sophisticated enough for their menu. I ate the fries and broccoli which was good, but was very disappointed that I wasted $20."}
{"text":"With other reviews extolling the virtues of the burgers, we decided to give the KCT a try before a play at Lakeland CC. Wife had the onion soup and said it was good. I had a burger - it was outstanding. Previous reviews were correct. My wife had a turkey burger and thought was very good too. 

Place has the atmosphere of a small town hang out. Kids were in abundance but after 7pm, the place began to fill with adults. 

The bartender was friendly, not too talkative. Just right. 

Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Last night, a miserable rainy Tuesday (election night) the place was packed. Every seat and the bar was full.  Reason? Great food, great service. Period.  You cannot go wrong at the Kirtland City Tavern.  Casual atmosphere with serious food and they make a good cocktail!"}
{"text":"Best Cuban sandwich in the area and their wings are also top notch.  Sunday wings and beer specials make for an enjoyable end to the weekend."}
{"text":"Per my previous review, food and staff are very good but recent visit was a bit disconcerting.  We sat at the left end of the bar and there are 3 flat screen TVs at the bar, one on each side and larger TV in middle.   Left TV had on FOX News, middle had on Indians game, right had on Indians game.  A regular customer comes in and sits in the middle of the bar.  Bartender knew the guy and he asked for left TV, by where we were sitting, to be switched to hockey game. She changes TV to hockey without even asking us if okay.   Okay, that's fine because we were watching the Indians on the middle TV.  Well, this guy is barely watching the hockey game and 15 minutes later he asked the bartender to change the larger middle TV to hockey, which she does.  So now we can't even watch the Indians game because she catered to this inconsiderate jerk instead of checking with those at the left end of the bar.  Right TV had the Indians game but we couldn't see it.  We didn't bother to ask her to change the left TV back to the Indians game because she obviously didn't care.  We reflected our lack of consideration in our tip, which is usually 25% but not this time.  When the Cleveland Indians are playing and you switch 2 out of the 3 TVs to hockey for one person, that is just crap."}
{"text":"Loved the bartop.  I went with the burger for lunch.  It was good, not great.  Yes it is huge and juicy but the burger itself needed to be seasoned.  Bartender was very friendly.  The place draws lots of locals so I will definitely go back and get somehing else off the menu."}
{"text":"Hidden jem!!! The dive bar menu is great lots of made from scratch items on the menu. My wife and i both enjoyed are food and friendly service. We ordered the stuffed hungarian peppers and tavern chips with there house made cajun and ranch do. The chips were well cooked and seasoned, the peppers were nicely stuffed and spicey! 
Mains we ordered were the french dip that my wife got and said it was delicous and it was a huge portion. I orderd the KCT boy and it was a well seasoned house made patties and there special sauce is good. 
All in all it was a great experience, glasses were never empty and servers were very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back and refering are friends and family."}
{"text":"We have been going here for many years and have never had a bad experience.  Excellent food and cold draft beers.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Don't expect to get your meal quickly, but that's OK. It's worth it. Their burgers are the best and the Cobb Salad is huge and chock full of everything a Cobb salad should have. I can get 2-3 meals out of it. Pleasant servers."}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers around . Fresh cut fries also a delicious side. You won't find another burger better than this"}
{"text":"We went after a trip to the Holden Arboretum. So glad we decided to go in and check if there were seats for us b/c the parking lot looked full but everyone was out back on the sand volleyball courts. So if it looks full do yourself a favor and go inside first. The food was beyond delicious. I got the BBQ pork flatbread, husband got the KCT Boy burger, daughter got hot dog and fries and son got mac and cheese. Their fries, homemade chips and wings with the Grandad Rub were amazing. Everything is homemade including the Ranch and Italian dressing.  Wish it wasn't so far away from us. Defined a meal to remember."}
{"text":"I like KCT but did have one time we were shunned because we asked for PBR to drink at the bar.  (You would of thought we asked for a glass of bleach) Otherwise, food is good and service is fast/ good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is delicious, consistent and affordable.  Their burgers are the best.  Literally, the best burger in Cleveland.  Their fries are hand cut and yummy with vinegar on the tables.  The pot roast sandwich is also great.  For appetizers the mussels and nachos are great.  Recently had a remodel and was a major upgrade.  The owner is always there helping customers-I like that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch because my wife loves the steak sandwich. Waitress mentioned they have the Tuesday wing special so I like wings so I ordered them. I was reluctant to try the Vern's Burns sauce but like hot so I asked for a side of the sauce. I was very impressed, just hot enough but not enough to drive you to sweat, excellent sauce and the wings were prepared to perfection."}
{"text":"This place was really great. It's an unassuming little tavern with absolutely fantastic food. My half-pound (!!!) char-grilled burger was great, and the hand-cut fries were warm and crispy and wonderful. The bar had a nice selection of beers on draft. The only downside was that there was a bit of a wait, but I think that was because we happened to come on a 50 cent wing night, so they were pretty busy! Next time I'd like to try the wings, french onion soup, and fried mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!  Dim light to hide the dirt.  Smelled like old fish.  Went with girlfriends today Saturday and ordered the special open face roast beef, first came cold, they took it back and nuked it.  No flavor at all.  We will not go back!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!   Food is as awesome as the very friendly and personable service!!!     My highest recommendation"}
{"text":"Awesome local bar! Great burgers, delicious stuffed hot peppers appetizer, and we found a couple cool brews in the beer list."}
{"text":"J.K. is pretty on with his review.  The burgers are worth going back for, again and again.  Monday is half price burger night just as an FYI.  I've also tried the Nacho and that was pretty good too.  They participate in the Lake County Bar Crawl every year and I'd be lying if I told you I didn't get excited when Kirtland's weekend was coming up.

Bar and bathrooms are small.  Long bar and lots of tables.  It appears they do outside events in the summer which sounds fun.  The no Credit Card policy stinks but I always come prepared.  Beers were cheap as you would expect with a small town bar like this.

Recommendation:  Go Monday, around 7ish, for Burger night and a beer.  My favorite is mushrooms and bleu cheese with a little mayo....did I mention they are 1/2 lb burgers....sorry......enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came in on the weekend, on Labor Day, and they have one waitress working. They have an amazing menu, and an excellent atmosphere. That nice lady worked her butt off and made excellent meal time. I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"I was told the ribs were delicious so 9 family members went here for dinner.  The first bad sign of trouble was the ribs were COVERED in 1/2\" of BarBQue sauce. Must be hiding something- & I was right. They were the fattiest toughest ribs I have ever experienced. Ribs are suppose to fall off the bone from hours of slow cooking- I couldn't even get my fork to saw through the meat/fat.  I truly should have sent the order back to the kitchen but I knew it wouldn't make a difference since everyone  else's  were just as bad. Not one redeeming thing about this meal. The coleslaw was lousy & the house salad consisted of iceberg lettuce with one piece of green pepper @ one slice of red pepper. Oh!  And to top it off when the waitress brought the bill she informed us the credit card machine was down!!  Don't bother w this place for ribs- head over to bugaboo creek."}
{"text":"Great, juicy burgers -- very large. Friday fish fry done well, if a bit heavy on the breading. Very friendly staff. Avoid the \"French\" onion soup -- was liberally sprinkled with something like chili powder. Warning: takes cash only; there's an ATM inside.

Addendum: Having eaten here several times since, I regret to say that any attempts to stray away from the burgers leave us disappointed. Like the odd French onion soup I had early on, my adventure with nachos left me wondering if this was what a dish would be like if it were created by a very well-meaning space alien who attempted to duplicate Earth food with only photos of the finished product to go by.

However, the burgers remain awesomely good."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior of this place stop you from coming in to try the food. I stopped in with my girlfriend after we had a rigorous day of cold weather hiking and we were really hungry for something hearty. This was recommended by friends and their endorsement of the tavern food was spot-on.

I had the andouille sausage sandwich with fried shrimp, French fries, and cole slaw topped with the house habañero sauce. It came with homemade chips, which were thick and crispy. My girlfriend had the California burger, a thick, juicy hamburger topped with avocado and bacon and plated with a giant pile of fries. We had a side order of onion rings that were coated in a tempura-like batter. We had so much food, we each halved our food and shared it.

We topped all of that off with their homemade peach cobbler served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Wow!

For all that food, plus two glasses of Coke (that were refilled without asking), our bill was very reasonable. Everyone seemed friendly and families were beginning to stream in for dinner hour.

I thought this was a very comfortable and enjoyable place and I'm eager to come back and try more food!"}
{"text":"Went there for their Tuesday half off burgers. I was a bit disappointed with the deal, because apparently everything is a la cart (fries are extra, for example).
So all and all we paid the same price as for a regular prices burger meal elsewhere.
However, the burgers taste fantastic! I have to give it to them."}
{"text":"Great Food all around!  Burgers are in my top 3 of favorite burgers.  Newly updated feel to the place, neighborhood friendliness and charm.  Service is always great!"}
