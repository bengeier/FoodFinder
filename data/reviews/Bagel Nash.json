{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat. I'm referring to the restaurant. They also have a bakery but I haven't tried it yet. I tried many Shawarma places and this is the best around here. All food is fresh and tasty. Greatly recommended"}
{"text":"100% complete disappointment this place was for me. I went in for a breakfast sandwich as they advertise breakfast anytime. And they only have eggs, no bacon, no sausage , no ham, no hashbrowns, just eggs, LOL! So I decided to try there Montreal sandwich. It was ok, for the price..never worth it, it was small and comes with lousy pickles that they use for there shawarma. So I go in again and give it another shot to try there chicken shawarma wrap or pita as they have. Customer service? What's that? , I walked in and I heard the lady saying to her worker, \"ugh shit\" cause I came in and no one else was in the store so I must of interrupted her conversation. So once again the shawarma was a complete let down, I asked for hot pepper tomatoes and pickles and I don't remember seeing any of that. Hot sauce didn't even taste. The pita was like a circle sandwich that the bottom was ripped open and the top also I asked the lady I thought this was a wrap? She replied \"what you never been here?\" I wanted to Burt out laughing! As no one was in there. I felt like telling her to start looking for a new job because I don't think anyone will be \"going\" there on a regular basis especially with the rent they pay there and everyone in there no matter what time maby 1 other person is there and 4-6 employees LOL what a money pit! Mind as well take money and light it on fire. The only thing I would get there are small chocolate croissants if I decide to ever go back for a sweet craving but nothing else."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of bagels plus many other great baked goods. Everything is fresh and tastes like home. This place is awesome for quick meals, light snacks, sweets and more. Nice and welcoming atmosphere too. Will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Tried it twice. Food is kinda bad. Very overpriced. Bagels are decent, but you'd expect much better given the place has \"bagel\" in the name."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese bagel sandwich (Nash Grilled Cheese) was so good!!!  I have never had a bagel sandwich like this where there was no hole in the bagel -- which is what a traditional Jerusalem bagel must be.  Instead, it was a flat bagel and within the gooey melted cheese, there were olives, onions, and mushrooms.  It was such a great combination!

The tomato and cucumber salad (Nash House Salad) that came with the sandwich was so refreshing and was light thanks to the lemon vinaigrette!

Falafel Pita on a Plate: The falafels were crispy on the outside but its insides were slightly seasoned with a little heat, but really tasty.  I ate the items on the plate individually at first to try out the falafels and then later used the pita to wrap up the items to try it out that way.  It was really tasty.  I especially liked the hummus which had a little bit of spicy oil on top of it.  The hummus was really flavourful and tasty!"}
{"text":"horrible place. Doesn't even deserve one star. Horrible service. Terrible because the food is great. The employees are very rude. This old lady is specific. I asked for sauce on the side on my shawarma sandwich and she was rude and said that was a plate, and I wasnt allowed to do that. The sauce is included with the pita so I should've been allowed to do that. That lady ruined my experience and I will never be coming to this rude, terrible restaurant ever again

Update: went again to see if it got any better and it was the same. Same terrible attitude with the same horrible lady. Never returning."}
{"text":"Great chicken salad bagel. Open industrial friendly feel. Prices OK.  Clean. Lots of electrical outlets for connectivity. Staff talk to eacj othet in groups a lot. Been here 1 hour. Good customer service. Will definitely come back. Fantastic baked goods for sale."}
{"text":"It's nice having a good, cheap, bagel shop nearby. The downsides are the service (which isn't all that impressive), and the atmosphere, which is a bit barebones. Also, there are two counters, one saying \"ORDER HERE\" on a sign in large writing. If you attempt to order in there, they look at you like you're nuts and direct you to the other counter.

Their Sunday bakery deal is great-- 12 bagels (of good quality) for about $3.50, and they have pretty nice deals such as a $5 breakfast and coffee, or a $5.95 wrap."}
{"text":"What goes well with a warm Sunday morning? Bagels and Brunch! Second time here at Bengal Nash- more of a bakery it seems, than a restaurant due to its non table service approach to dining. But there is a distinct division between its bakery side and hot table. 

The seating area is quite spacious. You simply order and pay at the front, grab your tray and coffees and enjoy. My company ordered thrn?$4.95 breakfast which comes with two eggs, bagel and coffee. Literally you get two eggs, no starchy potatoes or any other goodies. I ordered some crispy turkey bacon for the table, and a cup of cream cheese with sliced tomato and cucumbers. For everything, 3 specials, extra bagel cream cheese and sliced veg came out to about $23.90. 

The bagels are delicate and fresh. Coffee is got and good (watch those flimsy cups without lids) whixh is begging for a traditional rugelach: a delicious buttery Yiddish pastry from the old world. 

Overall, good service (don't believe the negative reviews as it is not a full service and is geared predominantly for take away). So next time you're at Steels and Dufferin on a Sunday with Bubbi- drop in for a few bagels and coffee and you'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"So this was my second time coming to dine in, but I've bought bagels from them multiple times. They advertise a breakfast deal for 4.95$ comprised of 2 eggs any style, a bagel or toast and a small coffee or tea. The first time I came here, I ordered just that and it was fine.

Today, I decided to try out their omelette. I ordered the omelette with onions and cheddar cheese, roasted potatoes for an additional 0.50$ (have the option of a salad or sweet potatoes), a bagel and a tea to go. It all came to about 14$. Everything smelled really great and I was really looking forward to having a nice and filling breakfast. 

As usual, their bagel was delicious - I have nothing to say about that. However, when it came to the eggs and roasted potatoes, there was waaaaaay too much oil. My mom tried one piece of the potatoes and wouldn't finish it, since she found it too oily. I was really hungry and ate about half of the omelette and the potatoes. Boy do I regret that. I don't think I tasted much of the cheese, but there was a hefty amount of onions (which I appreciate). Right before writing this review I had to take some tums. In retrospect, I should have probably either stuck to their plain eggs or ordered an egg white omelette (big maybe though). Either way, I would never order the potatoes again. 

I will most definitely come back for their bagels, as they are absolutely delicious. But, I would order their omelettes with caution or not at all.

----------------------------------
This is an update review..

I have to say that their bagels are indeed delicious. I come back almost on a weekly basis to get bagels or their sandwiches (cravings!!). Their borekas are also yummy, whenever they have any left.

I still don't think that I would order their omelettes anytime soon, but I'm definitely a returning customer for some of their other products. Their customer services is also very good, as they always welcome me with a smile and are very kind to their customers."}
{"text":"Bagel Nash can be a good lunch option if you work around this neighborhood. The bagels here are always fresh and prices are reasonable. Decor is pretty basic though.

If you want a bagel - grab a bagel on the side and bring it to the counter to order your options. Cream cheese and lox is hands down my favorite.

The other half of the bakery serves full lunch/brunch options. Portions are big and again, prices are not bad. Order from the counter and take a seat. The cool thing here is that they don't mind you bringing drinks from outside to this area. So I usually grab a starbucks and order a brunch here.

Overall, Bagel Nash is A-OK."}
{"text":"I love bagels. I am a fan of Montreal-style ones. When I am either in Montreal or Ottawa, I buy dozens and bring them home. I freeze them. So good!

If I manage to find a job in either one of those cities, I'd be in heaven, simply because bagels would keep me content. 

I have driven by Bagel Nash on my way home from work. I decided to stop by there for a light dinner bite. 

There is plenty of parking space here. I went in and there were a few people. 

To get a bagel sandwich, you choose the bagel or speciality baked good (for example, a croissant) from the front, put it in a white paper bag, and bring it up to the front. You then select what filling and toppings that you want. 

I went with a corn bagel with corned beef. The bagel isn't exactly Montreal-style -- a little bigger. However, I liked it. I have never had corn. The place also has sun-dried tomatoes, which I'd love to try. 

The sandwich itself wasn't spectacular. It was skimpy on the corned beef. The dill-mustard mayo was divine, though. I love anything with dill. 

I also ordered these thin cinnamon pretzels. The cinnamon was generous, but there was no sugar. It needed some sweetness to it. The pretzel was soft and chewy. 

If come back here to get corn bagels. The best bagels are still out east.

{"text":"The place is new and big and full of promise, unfortunately it falls flat on its face as soon as you reach the order counter.

I don't mean to offend anyone, but is English even a requirement for a customer service job in Toronto? It was impossible to understand the difference between the regular sandwich and a special, multiple hand gestures didn't help either. 

The egg salad sandwich I got was mediocre at best. Skimpy amount of egg salad tasted stale and the chunks of egg whites were huge. The bagel was chewy with a big hole in the middle, so half the egg salad ended up in the bag.

Overall, for this place to even have a fighting chance at surviving ever expanding WAB they need to up their game big time. I'll try coming back for a second taste if they are still around in 6 months, but for now I'm out."}
{"text":"Last Time!
I've been coming to the new location on Dufferin, since they opened. I originally was going to their location on Bayview Ave., but stopped going because of the poor service and surliness of their employees. 
I've been a loyal customer at their new location since it opened and have recommended it to many, mostly because of the freshness of their bagels, NOT because of their service or helpfulness.
Well, today was the last time for me. I continually excused this locations poor service, lack of communication with employees ( some barely speak English or seem confused by the simplest request) and lack of customer service, thinking, that this was due to their initial \"birthing pains\" of a new business in a new location.
Unfortunately, I suspect that this is just the overall atmosphere that's permeated and has infected BOTH locations. Surliness and unhelpful employees is NOT helpful to ANY business. 
There's too many choices out there to put up with this kind of rudeness, especially to a customer, that up to now, with all I wrote, was loyal. 
NO MORE!!!"}
