{"text":"I used to frequent here a lot when i lived down the street but quit going a few months back after the service just became so bad. It didnt matter if i was the only one  there, it took forever to get drinks and service and a few bartenders acted like you were a huge nuisance being there. Plus, the place isnt near the deal it was a couple years ago. Most all of the food and drinks have gone up in price. The food quality has detoriorated also. Like someone said, this place caters to the VERY old who come here to literally die. There are a lot of chronic gamblers and heavy smokers so the place is almost impossible to breathe in. Its best attributes were during football season when it ran good beer specials and appetizer deals. Not even sure if it does that anymore. The TVs were of poor audio and visual quality also."}
{"text":"Great little place!  Trish and Zeke are tend a great bar! Anthony the cook makes the Best Potato Skins in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time. It's an ok place as far as 24/7 gaming lounges / restaurants go. But the main reason to go here is happy hour.  For happy hour, most of the appetizers are half off, and drafts beers and margaritas are $1. So it's a pretty good deal. The food itself is just average. Similar to what you could do at home after shopping the frozen food aisle. But with a group of folks sharing 4 appetizers, my total was just $4.50 - and you can't really beat that.  When you walk in, there's a lounge section and a restaurant section. The restaurant section is just booths and tables. The lounge section is the main bar (with video poker, of course), a few rows of slot machines, and it is all bordered by a line of booths.  There's nothing particularly of note here. No interesting decor of unique quirks. But if you are short on cash and in the area, the happy hour is a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger ... onions were old and the bread was as hard as rock. The food was just old. And the waiter had on a dirty shirt and I kind of regret coming here to eat."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  We were the only ones in there on a Sunday morning around 10am.  Strange.  I think our waiter was also the chef and busboy and bartender too  Lol."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas and was excited to live within walking distance from a sports bar with video poker.  I enjoy video poker!  I live across from Greens.  I've been there 3 times and each time has been so disappointing,the last time insulting.  The first two times, which were on Saturday's during the day, I had a hell of a time getting a drink, at a bar. I spent $40 playing .$25 video poker and got one drink.  Terrible service.  The last time I will ever visit this place was tonight.  I was ejected on a Saturday night (9/17) at 12:30am because I was whistling to music.  Apparently the unhappy lady sitting 10 feet from me complained to the bartender who asked me to leave because my whistling annoyed this woman.  This is Saturday night with music blasting.  This woman, who must be having an affair, and was rude, convinced this jerk of a bartender to ask me to leave for whistling.i will complain to Stations Casino.  This place needs to be shut down.  15 minutes later...... I realize I left my card and did t get my station credits.  After ringing in, the bartender confronted me and I told him I left my card and didn't get my 3x Station credit.  He gave me my card and told me to leave.  I asked him, \"are you really asking me to leave because i whistle?\"  His girl said \"No, I asked him to throw you out because I couldn't stand your whistling\".  At that point, I was escorted out, with no station credit.  I told the bartender I would complain to management, and he laughed saying \"tonight was his last night.  He called me a douche, and slammed the door.  Don't go here!  I'm 52, no record, and raised two kids who graduated college.  To be 86'd by this loser because his cheating wife said so, says a lot about this place."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service when Zea is working, great if Trish is tending bar!  Machines are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  Dont bother with this small little bar!   I was here at 2pm....the menu is meager, my burger was cooked without an ounce of flavor, my onions were frozen and the lettuce was a slimy brown color.  The fries were hot, but zero seasoning.  The bartender had the personality of a dead fish...perhaps it was the throwing of the menu at me and long stares that creeped me out.  So many good local bars and so many options ... But this isnt one.....  Bypass immediately ..."}
{"text":"Didnt go into the restaurant section, but hung out in the lounge for a few hours with friends after eating sushi at The Ka in the same shopping center. It was smoky, and like a tiny casino. And everyone there looked like they went there to die, probably the oldest crowd I have seen in a bar in Vegas/Henderson. The bartender was very nice, and even cracked a few jokes with us. Best part....cheap drinks. :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times because my parents walk here to gamble and eat. This place is what other yelpers have commented \" a place to die \".  The food is terrible in my opinion.   I ordered a chicken sandwich and only ate half my meal.   The bartenders are nice and their service is decent.  I just can't see anyone under the age of social security collection enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Walked into have a drink bald bartender tells us we need to keep it down. Well there are better options. Never seen him before been here plenty times just means won't be back"}
