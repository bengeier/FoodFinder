{"text":"Stumbled across this spot while out in AZ on vacation.  Went on a Saturday night and they had a live band that was off the chain.  The lounge was nice and the service was great.  We danced until the spot closed at 2. We also met the manager and he  gave us access to a back room lounge.  (Good looking out)  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely be stopping through.  Not just for the music and atmosphere but during my 5 days in Scottsdale it was the first time I actually saw a bunch of people that looked like me  (Finally)  Go check it out you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Kenny and Jimmy were the best bartenders ever!!! They were so genuinely nice and made us feel so welcome! Ken definitely has a gift to make people laugh. My sisters and I felt like we knew him all our lives. We will be back!!!       Thanks Jim and Kenny!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was here back in 10/13 and thought this place was on its way out.  Thankfully the little details that make a nightspot a gem were all addressed. Diversity, Class & it seemed like folks come to Casablanca to have fun.  1. ALL the staff were on point.  From the gal at the door; the bouncers were cool; the bartenders were smooth with drink prep.  Who slices a lemon to rub on the rim of a glass and then takes a towel to wipe the glass down????  I'd expect that from a place charging more than just $10 at the door.  Nice touch.  The guy in the restroom seemed like he knew each paper towel personally & actually pointed out an upturned collar and another dudes tie that was tucked into his pants.  Classy.  2.  The live music.  The band was SWIF Music...hands down the best band I've seen in AZ.  PERIOD.  A full band playing R&B and doing it well....never seen it before in AZ.  They had the floor packed & folks were getting it in.  The back vocalists were dancing, the lead was dancing.  If you've ever seen a local band with big talent, you'll know how it felt.  They had a song about remembering to visit the bartenders.  You'd think it would come off as trashy but they grooved it.  They did Treasure by Bruno Mars & Remember the Time by MJ back to back and killed both of em.  If you like live R&B with a seamless band, you can pay $$$ to see Mint Condition or you can check SWIF out.  (https://www.facebook.com/SwifMusic)  3.  Patrons.  It looked initially like the normal mix of scottsdale pretty people and the folks that came to watch/touch them.  That changed quick.  This goes back to the band cuz they turned up the energy and the well dressed folks in the room started dancing.  It was over from there.  I like seeing folks that put in effort to look their best put in work on the floor.  Old folks, young, white & black....everybody was rocking.  This mix is seen all over scottsdale but not in such a classy & fun way.    4.  DJ's.  Reggae outside and a ridiculous 90's/Top 40 mix that never sagged indoors.  The DJ's were in tune with the room and it showed.   The owners & investors at Casablanca should be very proud."}
{"text":"This place is great. Each dish is carefully made and they always make sure the customer is happy. Top shelf drinks, food, and staff... But more importantly the atmosphere. Shelly our bartender/waitress and all the staff members are so nice and attentive. I cant say enough good things about this Lounge! Simply put, if you get a chance to go, go. Just. Go."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. Couldn't get any bartenders or any staff member for that matter attention inside or outside. When we finally got a bartenders attention and asked for a menu she said they didn't have one and didn't even try to locate one for us.  Maybe it was an off night."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's the perfect place to either sit inside and dance the night away to the live bands or amazing DJ, or sit outside on the patio enjoying music and relaxing. The food is fabulous as well as the drinks. The staff is so attentive and helpful. This is our new favorite hangout!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to report that \"The Casablanca Lounge\" that was a welcome oasis in a sea of cocktail mediocrity has morphed into just another downtown Scottsdale bar.  What attracted me instantly to The Casablanca Lounge were skilled and thoughtful bartenders that would produce wonderful and interesting craft cocktails with quality ingredients and were absolutely focused on quality, artisanal recipes and most of all, the experience of mixology from a time long forgotten.  I was \"this\" close to recommending it for my companies in flight magazine as one of the last great American bar experiences, but I'm sort of relieved that I never got around to submitting my recommendation.  It starts like this.  My wife and I thought we'd drop by for a cocktail this last saturday night for a delicious and interesting craft cocktail.  We approach the door and there's a podium set up and a lady we hadn't seen before who asked us, \"May I help you?\"  \"We're just here for some cocktails.\"  A pause.  \"Well, it's $10 for men, $5 for women.\"  That's odd, well, it was already past midnight so I didn't think it was worth paying a cover, which we hadn't been asked to pay before so I turned around.  \"$5!  $5 each! $5 for both!\"  Odd.  But then she let us in free.    We walked into the bar and it... was... disgusting.  Dirty floors, glasses across the bar, unattended and it looked like a disaster area.  We find a couple of clean seats at the bar and wait.... and wait.. and wait.  I disappear to the restroom and my wife is going to order a couple of drinks.  Then I realized that they must have had a management change because I've seen better kept restrooms in a Greyhound bus station.  During previous visits, this would have never happened.  I return to the bar and our two cocktails have arrived.  Instead of orange and lemon zest in our cocktails, we've literally got orange and lemon peels (thick pith and all) in our drinks, an incorrect liquor was used (we ordered Basil Haydens and we were charged Basil Haydens prices but for something with much lower quality) and the drink was absolutely incorrect.  After another 15 minutes, and watching some strange man walk in and out of the bar area that seemed to be a manager (tall guy, coat, scarf) but didn't seemed concerned with the operation of the bar, but seemed more interested in drunken female patrons and collecting numbers), we finally found a bartender to talk to about our cocktails.  He agreed that they weren't made properly and that there are a lot of new people and training was fairly lacking.  Sad.  We're already 45 minutes in, at this point, and I haven't had more than a couple of sips of my re-made beverage when one of the nastiest things on earth happens.  I feel something sticky on my pant leg and there's a large glob of gum was stuck on the leg of my chair and was now smashed into my pants.  I grabbed a napkin and did my best to remove it, but I'm afraid even as of Sunday, 22 hours later, my pants are permanently ruined.  I'm both pissed and sad.  I'm pissed about my experience and paying $30 for two drinks that I could have gotten poorly made ANYWHERE.  And I'm sad because one of the reliable greats, and oasis of cocktail wonderful in downtown Scottsdale has died under what seems to be horrific management, unskilled bartenders and a lack of basic bar cleanliness.  My favorite pants are absolutely ruined.  How this place went from a place that I would recommend to all of my friends and colleagues to an expensive, pretentious version of \"Patti's\" should be a federal crime.  Disgusting.  Unclean.  Pretentious.  Save this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and AMAZING food! The cocktails are carefully crafted and tasted great."}
{"text":"awsome sexy place..... the theme is romantic and the belconey views are high up and magical...lol with the right date im sure u can light up the sky"}
{"text":"Out for the night in Old Town for my Birthday and decided to stop by for a drink or two after dinner.  $5 cover charge which is understandable as they had a band.  However could not get service and every table was reserved even though the place was empty.  Sister in Law asks where we can sit for a drink.  Bartender replied that we should try Kazmierz, a wine bar across the street.  So, out the door we went to never go back.  Certainly will be letting all the friends know not to visit."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was Estate House..... though I never ate there. Just drank. Lots. But I did love the fact that it was a rooftop bar, with a great view of downtown or the waterfront, depending on which side you sat. Who doesn't love a good glass of wine on a warm spring day, while watching the sun set? This girl loves it.  I was sad when Estate House closed, but was hopeful that something else just as great would open up. I think some sort of Cigar bar opened there... which I never went to. But then, as per usual in old town, that closed too, and then I heard rumblings of this new lounge opening.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm no longer hip. A big night out for me is staying up until 10:30pm. I was a bit worried about heading to Casablanca after dinner one night with friends and all the cool people at the bar laughing at me. Well, I can say, they didn't laugh. They were actually very low key, nice and welcoming. We sat outside, enjoyed some great drinks - and my husband just adored their Scotch selection.  We have gone back a few times for after dinner drinks - and each time we have a blast. I love this place - I really really hope it sticks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Friday for date night. I enjoyed the decor and the outside patio. It was a nice crowd and you can tell the people came dressed to impress. The DJ on the outside patio was superb and the views of the city made the evening. I really wanted to kick up my heels with the crowd but the music was too loud for the space and the inside seating was very limited unless you reserved a table."}
{"text":"Worst place in Old Town Scottsdale. Do not waste your 10 bucks walking in the door if you want actual customer service."}
{"text":"A group (4) of us went there after dinner mainly to just chill and   listen to the vibes from the patio DJ. We had Katie taking care of us that night and she did us justice. She kept our drinks coming and even helped us with inside seating when the rain drove us in. Which we're glad it did, the band that was playing was on point, we all enjoyed ourselves.   This is a nice chill spot we all enjoy but hadn't been since new management. Service (Katie) was great and everyone else made us feel appreciated. Definitely will keep this spot in the rotation. ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner mostly to see the view. Live band was playing, which was nice, but not nearly nice enough to make up for the terrible service. I can't stress this enough, the service is rudely offensive. Not too mention slow and/or non-existent. I'd give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I wish I knew about this place before just last week. After dinner at the Herb Spot, we went upstairs to the lounge. I had no idea what i was getting into.  The evening I went, the crowd was much older.  There was a band playing with the smooth sounds of George Hamilton busting out some Motown and R&B hits and sounded really good.  There is a nice outdoor area.  I'd much rather head to this place to hang out for drinks then some of the trendier places around the area.  Drinks are reasonable and received my drinks pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I made reservations here last night for a group of girls on a bachelorette party.  When we got there our table was ready with a reserved sign on it.  The host seated us and the fun began.  We had drinks flowing and were enjoying the atmosphere and music.  The singer was very engaging and we had a blast dancing with the group.  We were positioned close to the stage and we just was able to engage with the staff and the band.  I would highly recommend this spot. IT was roomy and had a great feel to the place. Our waitress was adorable and spot on with keeping to our group of 11!! Thank you Casablanca for a good time!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD for a lounge. As with most bars, I expected the food to be mediocre, but NOT HERE. The lobster and cheese sandwich and the wild boar sliders are an amazing partner to the many many local beers on tap.   The atmosphere was very friendly and comfortable. This lounge is good whether you're in a large group of 12, or just an intimate group of 2, there is a place for everyone.   Great bands, great music, and great staff. I'm not a local to Scottsdale, but I will always drop in and have a great time here!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place, good small plates, especially the tacos.  Sunset was beautiful, service great with personal attention. Wine and cocktails were delicious and of good variety. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Casablanca Lounge on a Thursday night. First impression was it's very hard to find. Upon entering, a great looking room with awesome patios. I like to think of myself as a cocktail enthusiast. The cocktail menu read well and a couple of drinks really stood out. Had their seasonal mule and a couple of shots of whiskey that were harder to find in the valley. Bartenders were great and happy with the drinks. Then the music went on, we had migrated to the patio to enjoy a wonderful AZ night and were blasted by distorted and terrible guitarist / vocalist. I really wanted to throw him a fish! We lasted about 4 songs then tabbed out and left after we couldn't bare the musical ear infection anymore. As we left we realized how awful the music really was, we heard 2 more groups on the street comment on where that awful music is coming from. All in all, Place is cool. Drinks and bar staff great. Minus one star for location and signage. Almost minus two but just one star for music. Maybe they were just entertaining one of their investors and letting his son play or something!"}
{"text":"Great vibe here with upscale decor (lounge style). Bartenders made great drinks, patio had excellent views and nice to go out onto at night, comfortable seating and killer live band (Friday night). Will certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Fun place to go and sit roof-top on comfy couches with a great view of downtown Scottsdale.   Entertainment was good on a Friday night and I would recommend for either a date or a group event.  Food was just ok, that's why it didn't get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is very amateur.  We had a couple margaritas downstairs at the Herb Box (which rocks) then we went upstairs to the Casablanco, only to find they just won second place in a margarita contest using the same recipe we were just drinking downstairs!  Really?! Well at least the service was horrible."}
{"text":"The patio...awesome.   I went on recommendation from a friend of mine who took his wife there for their first date, now I found out why he got a second one. Tasty cocktails for my lady, craft beer for me, both were tremendous. The food was even better, and the staff was on point. Next time I'll have to check out the whiskey selection, and if I'm feeling froggy I'll have to acquire a cigar for the patio. I just missed the tequila dinner, which isn't really my thing but they did say that they are doing beer dinners, which is RIGHT up my alley. I immediately signed up for the mailing list, and look forward to the next one."}
{"text":"Excellent food ! Great view, and the hottest and most classiest women around.. I have been to many clubs seeking some nice women and this place surpassed any club that I've ever been to in the Phoenix area and I will continue to go there enjoy myself like I always do thanks so much for your great ambience classy women to mention beautiful women and the delicious food !!!"}
{"text":"This place is not organize and has management problem, we had a birthday celebration and everyone decided to meet up at the lounge at 8pm,there was about 15 people in our group, I was expecting a server within 20 minuets, our table was outside and it was hot and humid, 45 minuets later still no server and we are so thirsty and uncomfortable, I went to the bar and I asked a waitress if we can have a table as I see there was a lot of vacant tables, server explained that in order for me to be set inside I have to spend a minimum of $160.00 and I asked per table ??, server replied \"no each one has to spend 160.00\" per person, this is ridiculous !!!  @9pm there was 4 waitresses inside just happy chatting away and there was no server outside within an hour, I heard another table complaining about service, we walked out the place at 9pm and went to another restaurant to eat and drink and came back to Casablanca to join our friends again, and stayed just an hour and had 1 drink, all the time I was in Casablanca and  1 round of drinks to birthday girl, we could have spent more money on this place, I would rather spend our money someplace else that deserves our welcome, because of the service fiasco and the way your snooty server treated me and my friends we will not come back to this place, whoever owns this place my heart goes out to them, this place  is a money pit and their staff and management are huge liabilities, band is great and location is great, I am a business owner and entrepreneur..shame how they handle business."}
{"text":"First time there..loved the interior lounge, velvet slipper chairs, low tables, window seats, intimate yet open, dark rich colors, warm lighiting. Out door patio several seating areas a fire pit. All comfy and cozy seating. Ginger Basil Ciphirina...WOW! Great music and on Friday nights a jazz trio. I am definitely going back there with my husband next time."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something unique and satisfying check this place out. I love the welcoming, knowledgeable staff, the comfortable lounge and possibly the best patio in the valley (and I love patios). Great music, awesome staff, amazing selection of liquor and most importantly: a patio to die for. A must see on Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We used a Groupon which included 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine for about $20. The chicken wings were small and chewy and not very good. The cocktails were good and we ordered them during their happy hour. When it came time to pay our bill we were presented an iPad and didn't look closely at the itemized bill. We selected the 15% check box for the tip as the service was good but we weren't happy with the food or wine. I requested to have a receipt emailed to me and after seeing it after we left I was shocked at the total. We didn't get happy hour pricing on our cocktails as promised and our tip was now at 20%. A $15-$20 dollar bottle of house wine was listed on our bill at $45. This inflated price was obviously used to increase the overall total check to increase their tip. Based on what our overall bill with the Groupon amount included, we were charged a $20 tip for a $38 bar bill. After calling the restaurant to discuss and several emails, Cody the manager has failed to address my concern."}
{"text":"This place used to be classy, now it's very ghetto. I thought I'd keep going to see if things will change but they just keep getting worse not sure if there was management change.  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Have always planned to go there but after trying to eat dinner across the street at Kelly's while some obnoxious DJ talking nonstop with the volume overwhelming the entire neighborhood to the point it was difficult to even have a conversation a few hundred yards away I will never step foot in that place."}
{"text":"The dj system was like for a house party.  I paid $550 for a table plus a $100 mandatory tip, I waited a hour before I saw a server to give me ice or mixers for my bottle service then only twice throughout the night. I had to go to the bar myself to get mixers on table and bottle service.  Horrible service! Would give them negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Went there last night (Sat night) with some friends and had a pretty good time. I appreciated a mature element of Hip-Hop and R&B with no cover charge. Live band played between DJ sets. The DJ was actually pretty good which is quite the contrary of how I personally feel about most DJs in AZ. The setting and Aura were very nice too to bring a lady friend for a date. Balcony with heated lamps if u wanna step away from the music but still hear it in the background. Good eclectric group of people as well. I gave it four stars on their nightlife because they didn't have their bar fully stocked and were lacking Tito's vodka and several other requests I made for myself and my friends. The hookahs stopped being served a little early in my opinion but to be fair I don't remember the exact time we requested it. I just felt like we had time to kill when our request was made. Overall it's a nice spot to chill on a Sat night so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great place for the 30 plus crowd in Old Town Scottsdale. We loved the live music and dancing. However, the dance floor is small and unfortunately their servers often walk through the middle of the dance floor with drinks they are serving. Show up early on the weekends if you want to find a place to sit and enjoy the music and cocktails."}
{"text":"We were excited to Casablanca for date night, as we loved it when it was the Estate House. We arrived a bit early for our 7:30pm reservations and were led outside, past all of the cozy seats inside. I thought it odd we weren't asked for a preference.   But wait--it got worse. We were also taken past all of the cozy couches outside facing the movie playing and seated at this strange area way in the back. Between our two chairs, which overlooked the street, we had a giant heater and small table (in May). So much for date night. (The light-up menus are totally cool, though the selection is small.)  But wait--it still gets worse. Apparently our corner was the smoking area (!?), so they actually seated me, a severe asthmatic, in the middle of it. Thanks.  We ordered a crab dip, the sliders and the tacos. While waiting, we did get our well-mixed drinks. But then our waiter totally disappeared. After 35 minutes a water guy apologized for our slow food service. After 45 minutes it finally appeared. The two pork dishes were ok--but served totally lukewarm. The tacos were beautifully plated; the limes even had perfect grill marks on them. But couldn't they put that much care into getting me my damn food in a timely manner? While it's still hot? We didn't care for the crab dip, but that could be a personal thing. The plantain chips were yummy.  The final rub came with the service. Our waiter literally never came back after taking our order. When we decided we had enough, we actually went inside and stood at the empty bar and asked for our tab. Interestingly, no one thought that was odd.  So there we go. Bad service, mediocre food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I just went to this place yesterday with my older sisters for the first time.  The Casablanca is awesome!  Before I was 21, I would always walk by this place hoping to visit it someday.  When I went inside, this place was much classier than I imagined.  My sisters and I opened up our menus and were in awe of their light-up menus!  I think I kept opening and closing mine for a short while, lol.  Everything is clean and prestine.  When my beer arrived, it was in a beautiful glass with NO water stains whatsoever!!  This is not a place where you have to check your glass to make sure there aren't lip stains from a previous customer...  Jimmy and Ken were the bartenders taking care of us last night.  They were both VERY friendly and funny!  Ken should be a comedian!!  He had my sisters and I laughing for 2 hours!  Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey, but the drinks are fabulous!  It is definitely a treat to go to The Casablanca, and well worth the price.  :)"}
{"text":"The pros: cool place, nice decor, not too loud, comfy seating, great outdoor patio areas, Yummy drinks, nice crowd but not overcrowded. The cons: tip was added to bill, and when I paid, waitress never brought me back my change. Very tacky."}
{"text":"I went here while in Scottsdale a couple weeks ago and out of all the places I went I had the most fun here! The atmosphere was amazing, the drinks were perfect and the chicken wings I had were so delicious. Only thing I didn't like is the fact that I didn't spend more of my trip at Casablanca."}
{"text":"I love this place for Live music, atmosphere and good service!   The only tip I would share with Casablanca is to add more red wines to the menu and add in some bolder tasting ones too.  The current wine selection is the only reason it's a 4 star."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Great vibe. Good crowd, Well made cocktails and friendly staff. Will defintely want to go back there. Haven't tried the food yet, but that's happening next visit."}
{"text":"It was a Friday date night. Ventured in on a whim based on the name of the lounge entirely. The cocktail menu was very cool because I could actually read it in the dimly lit lounge thanks to the brain surgeon that set up the back lit menu. You are brilliant. The atmosphere is definitely a high end lounge feel. High back booths, dark woods & the deor is appealing for sure. The cocktails were delicious & very pretty. This night was apparently an old school R&B night & it was fun, fun. I really enjoyed myself & will be back with my friends in tow. Just a great place, name, location, drinks & DJ."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great..good location.. great starter place with friends, or a date night.  Love the music.. (A live jazz night would be awesome)  Lost a star for service.. they seem confused, Drinks are expensive"}
{"text":"This place is in a very nice area in Scottadale.  It was very easy to make a reservation and they allowed us to bring a birthday cake.  In the end we had a good time and will come back if we are in the area.   Pro- atmosphere was positive with great views of the district.  the drinks are made really well and the staff was knowledgable with friendly service.  Con- drink prices are really high. $14 for a basic cocktail with 1 oz of liquor is a $$$ bar.  The live band was great but we could hardly hear it outside."}
{"text":"My wife went there for the first time recently, and we were extra impressed! We sat on their beautiful outdoor rooftop patio for drinks and an appetizer.   My wife had a nice glass of Chardonnay and I had a generous, well-mixed Manhattan. For our appetizer we chose to share the meat and cheese tray, and we were most pleased with that choice. Not only was there a nice selection of meats and cheeses, but it also came with olives, pickles, and several other goodies that set this appetizer apart from similar ones at other places.   We're looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"This was a cool night spot. 2 DJ'S, indoor and outdoor.  The white dj outside was banging for real . Friday night was reggae set and Saturdays was hip hop and live band. Very diverse,  no craziness,  just everyone dancing, smoking cigars on the patio and having fun. Some sexy ladies and 2 for 1 cirocs and Henny 's happy hour  till 10pm both nights. I would come back again. ."}
{"text":"I first found this diamond in the rough when I was invited here for a seminar with Zymogen. Now, I came back to experience the nightlife. It is a quaint live bar with class and upscale drinks. I can't believe it's not packed all the time...amazing place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bluesy jazzy music from the band;  Ashley's bar-tending and drink-making skills and friendly banter; the talkative patrons; the comfortable surroundings. Parking can be tough but if you need to be a couple of blocks away, it's not a problem as the area is lively."}
{"text":"I think this place is at 3.5 stars for the moment, but I will round up based on my drink and bartender alone!  The 5 STAR moment: I had a VERY VERY good Tom Collins, made by a handsome bartender.  My friend and I decided to move to a table since we decided to order food, and the bartender continued to serve us, even though he had to continually walk around the bar.  It was nice and professional of him not to switch us over/close us out. The management was also very polite to come over to inquire about our experience at Casablanca.    The unfortunate part in our experience was our food was VERY late.  I know the food comes from the Herb Box, which is tasty and the restaurant was very busy (Saturday night), but the food was less than desirable how and when it was served.  The staff apologized and they did discount the food, so they did try and make it right. My biggest issue with the whole food experience is this has happened to me before with a large group here.    As far as the ambiance goes, this place is 'loungey' as the name says, with dark corners, dim lighting and cozy seating.  There is usually a band or a DJ playing enjoyable/soothing tunes.  It was dead when we arrived, but it picked up around 9...I am not complaining though because we were therefor able to have an outstanding bar experience.   Main point:  Go to Casablanca for drinks and the lounge...not the food."}
{"text":"They pair drink with a cigar for you, play live bongos and sometimes there is movie night. Great chill bar on a rooftop with river view."}
{"text":"If you have ordered anything here please be careful. Double check your credit card statements. I had two charges that went through for different amounts. I had called them and they can not provide me with the receipt for the second transaction, they said they don't even know which terminal it had gone through. Just wanted to keep people aware. I have been told that I would be refunded, but then they stopped responding completely.  Update: What's funny is that I have proof. I have the bank statement which I had sent to you guys. If you don't have it then go find Ashlynn cause she has the email. I also have an email from you guys saying that it will be reversed. I'd be more than happy to publicly post it if you would like. I never refused to not work with you guys. Let's make this right, Check your email."}
{"text":"Where to start... I run a wine club and once a month we meet at a different restaurant for a couple glasses of wine and apps (30 people). I made a reservation for last night at Casablanca and talked personally to the manager a  month ago. I specifically asked \"Do you have food?\" because I had only been there for drinks and wasn't sure. I was reassured by the manager that yes, they did have food no worries.   Well we showed us last night, 30 hungry people. NO FOOD. The bartender told us that their chef had quit last week. Okay so stuff happens, on to plan B. I went downstairs to arrange for food from The Herb Box. I talked to the manager there. He told me that Casablanca hasn't had food for TWO YEARS!!! Yep the manager LIED to me.  We had great service and the outside patio is superb. But the fact that they blatantly lie to their customers is unreal. Wow. Who does that?"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Thursday night and the place was empty but seemed cool. the cheese plate was the best I've ever had. Good experience...."}
{"text":"The Friday night DJ is the most obnoxious I've ever heard. He is continuously on the mic, screaming all night over top of every single song. Total amateur hour."}
{"text":"My gf paid 1500 for a table for 12. When we arrived we waited outside in the cold for at least 20 minutes. We were chaperoned to a table that seats 6 people. How do you pay for 12 and get seated for 6?!?! The service was horrible! We were constantly out of ice. I asked a server for a food menu and she never came back. I then went on a hike to find another server. I told her I asked for a menu and never received one. She said \"ok\" and walked away. Incredibly rude! Needless to say I never got to eat. Oh and the kicker?! In her total was 2 bottles of champagne. NEVER received!!! How do you advertise champagne for the new year. Charge for it and never deliver. UNACCEPTABLE! I will never return to this poorly run establishment!"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night and there was no cover. There was a live band that played jazz until around 10pm then a DJ took over playing hip hop. The views are gorgeous so definitely head to the patio. The servers and bartenders were kind and patient. This place is known for its scotch and cigar selection so definitely ask for a menu. As for seating, it's mostly reserved so call ahead of time to reserve a table.  Getting to it can be tricky. Look for a ground level sign that points in the direction of the stairs and just follow the stairs all the way up to the third level. You won't hear much of the music so look for a security guard.  I would say this place is good for all ages. I saw some people in their 20's all the way up to their 50's."}
{"text":"Best music i've heard in a long time. Great DJ (joe malloy, the proper villain entertainment), good vibe and good drinks! And, fancy menus."}
{"text":"In the 30 minutes I was at Casablanca, I was underwhelmed. To say the least. The service is absolute shit. It's a really great atmosphere and there was an amazing live band and I even liked the light-up menus, but the service killed it for me. The manager tried to come over and salvage an experience that was spiraling downward for myself and seven other girls. She made it worse. Trying to get our checks sorted out was a nightmare. I almost felt sorry for our server because she clearly wasn't capable or prepared to handle a table of eight. We were told she was new by the manager, which I also didn't like. Why would you assign a new server to a group? She didn't know what was in the drinks and wasn't familiar with the menu. One of the girls in our group had to flag down the manager just to get my one (and only) round of drinks. I'd love to give this place another shot if they can invest in better service. The company, however, was fabulous! To all the ladies out on Saturday night, I had a blast with you all! Despite the Casablanca shitstorm. Does anyone know the name of the band that was playing there on Saturday? I'd definitely love to see them again (at another venue!)."}
{"text":"If your looking for a low-key place to have a couple drinks, this is the place. The balcony has awesome views and its in the heart of old town. Its a must try at least once or twice. The menus are electronic! Innovative, I must say :)"}
{"text":"It's places like these that really makes me hate going out in Scottsdale.  A pretentious, somber lit establishment where waitresses look like Dita Von Tease.  The one pro of this place is the lit up menus.  Those are pretty rad.  I will not be coming back!!"}
{"text":"The NYE PARTY is over priced with poor service. We purchased the table with bottle service and were required to include gratuity. It's clear why this is required. The service is poor and if it were not required, they wouldn't make tip. While I understand this is their \"busiest night\" one would think they would be prepared for this event as it only happens once per year.   Additionally, the club advertised no waiting when a VIP table was purchased. We waited nearly 20 min and an addtl 30 for a waitress to provide the mixers and open our bottle. Finally, the changed and increased the price twice, claiming incorrect information on their FB page. Not exactly the customers problem. STAY AWAY FROM HERE...save your money and hit somewhere, anywhere else."}
{"text":"Thanks Cody and Barbara very much for making my Birthday Celebration a night to remember. Everyone had an enjoyable time. everyone complmented the Speak Easy Room and the food was delish. Customer service was impeccable,  the hostess, went above and beyond to accommodate everyone. Then when we went into the main room, the band (Painted Soul) was on it, an added value, we partied hard until closing. Oh yeah!  not to mention, bottle service,  the hostess was also accommodating. The mixologist on the patio, served up a secret drink that was absolutely delish, I loved it. Casablanca's is definitely a great place to have a good time."}
{"text":"Sigh... If this place had a little better service, I could over look their high priced cocktails. They are all set up for an upscale lounge, but they don't quite deliver. We've been there several times but every time it gets a little worse.  Though I can't give it under 3 stars because they have the best roof top deck in Old Town and they do make killer drinks. If you want to smoke a cigar and drink a cocktail on the roof, this is the place to be. Just go to the bar to get your drinks, it's faster I promise!"}
{"text":"This hidden speakeasy is the epitome of class and ambiance. This is not the kind of place you accidentally stumble into. It's the kind of place where you would see the lights on the rooftop patio and wonder what's going on up there. Parking can be a challenge so I suggest valet parking.   The lounge is dimly lit and cozy, yet definitely upscale. The clientele ranged from 30's to early 50's. Seating is very comfortable and perfect for long conversations. They layout is arranged to allow adequate privacy and intimate conversations.  The \"mixologist\" (aka bartender) is friendly. Made us feel like old time friends. The server was a wee bit on the snooty side, but friendly enough and quick to empty ashtrays and check on us.   Outside, is a rooftop patio which quickly became my favorite area. There are misters under the cabana portion of the patio as well as sofa seating. Open seating consists of comfortable chairs and side tables. Outdoor heaters are present for chilly nights.   Entertainment that evening was a vocalist, accompanied by a guitar player and bongo player. She was talented as were the other two. Her voice was soothing and it was the perfect compliment for this type of environment/establishment.   The drinks were generous, well presented and flawlessly made. They were not watered down or weak. I was expecting a dainty little glass for my cocktail, but it was presented in a large, chilled tin cup and garnished beautifully. So speakeasy-esque.   This is the perfect place to enjoy a good cocktail and cigar, whether you're unwinding after a long day, or gearing up for a night on the town.   I will definitely be back. As often as I can."}
{"text":"Visited using a Groupon a had a good time. Gabrielle was our server and she was amazing! She was very attentive and great conversation. Chicken skewers we're alright, lobster grilled cheese wasnt fresh and tasted lobsterish (NOT fresh), wings were good though. Bottles of wine were tasty."}
{"text":"Had a nice stiff drink on the patio.  Can't comment on late night atmosphere, but the patio is very enjoyable.  Drinks are pricey, but expected for a handcrafted cocktail.  The views at sunset were a lot better before the condos across the canal went up."}
{"text":"Yes, the place is nice, but it is true, the service needs a lot of work.  When I came in, I asked the hostess to direct me to the group of girls I was meeting.  On my way there, I girl jump on my path, I didn't know who she was, but she was so rude, she cut me off, and on top she gives me the \"EXCUSE ME\" with the two snaps and a zig zag attitude. Later I realized she was a server.  Way to go, customer service.  I just laughed it off, because I was going to have fun with my girls.  I love meeting girlfriends out and there is very little that can upset me enough to not enjoy my night.  I really wanted to like this place, but the owners need to hire more experienced management and servers.  Not everyone is cut out to do customer service, specially in the \"service industry\".  My drink was good, I stayed with a safe bet I have had before.  I asked if I could have a taste, instead our server said she would ask the bartender to match my taste and  if I didn't like it she could switch it. I hate returning drinks.  It would have been so much easier to just let me have a taste and if I liked it, I would have had it.  The cheese platter was really pathetic for $25.  Hopefully they will take care of the kinks, because the place is very nice and the music was great.  This could be such a great place to hang out with friends and chit chat, without loosing your voice."}
{"text":"Best place to go in Old Town Scottsdale, hands down! I love this bar for a night out with friends, or even a date night. The live music is always great, lots of dancing, and a fun environment. They have a huge patio area with a fire to sit around if it's cool outside. The view is beautiful! The food is REALLY good! They obviously put a lot of effort into making the menu creative and are always switching things up. And the drink menu? AMAZING. I recently went there with my girlfriends and the hand crafted cocktails were the best they have ever been! I wanted to try them all! So much better than your typical rum & coke type bar! I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Nice lounge, good views and neat menus. The service had high points and low points. Upon walking in and wandering around looking for a place to sit down a waitress approached us and offered to help find our group a place to sit down and relax. Within 5 minutes she had a large seating area cleaned and ready for us. The low point was when I ordered a vodka martini on the rocks with a twist but got a regular martini, in a martini glass, with an olive.  I thought that was a bit odd for a high end lounge but maybe I should just learn to order more popular drinks in the future.    Full disclosure - I am rooting for these waterfront places to succeed. It has been a tough few years and I admire the business owners who keep putting these places out there hoping that one day their venture on Southbridge will make it for the long haul."}
{"text":"We came here because my friend loves rooftop bars and our friend suggested we check this place out. I guess rooftop bars in Cali are very different then in AZ because we were very let down. I'll break it down as simply as possible.   Pros: Quiet- Don't have to shout to be heard. Quick service Light up menus- LIGHT UP MENUS! So cool.  Cons: Over priced drinks- Payed like $60 for 3 drinks. Ouch! Even in Cali that would be crazy. \"Specialty\" drinks- Our waitress assured us this is what they are known for. The drinks had liquors I had never heard of before, so I asked what would be the closest to rum. The suggestion she made sounded great but when it came it was blech in my mouth. It tasted of just straight up ginger. There was no notes of any alcohol, or pleasant flavors. I decided to give it another try and got a drink that claimed to have pineapple, orange, and other flavors I like. When it came it tasted like I was drinking cooking sherry. Where was the pineapple? The oranges? NOTHING! Gross, gross drinks.  cougar/creeper town- When we arrived it was empty. By the time we were going to leave I needed to use the restroom. I had to push my way through a crowd of people at least twice my own age. The dance floor was full of just older people. This place is definitely not the place for the younger crowd.   I will keep away from this place like the plague to save my taste buds and my wallet."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Called ahead and was told they don't require reservations. Arrived and was told the owner was having a private party on the patio and someone from the restaurant had wandered out there so they closed the restaurant down so they wouldn't be disturbed Will never go back and will tell everyone about the terrible experience"}
{"text":"During the craziness of the PGA tour weekend we were pointed to Casablanca as a cool chill spot to have a cocktail or two. Seeing that Casablanca is one of my top 5 movies of all time we had to go.   Since it was a beautiful evening we sat out on the deck. We were immediately greeted and we ordered our cocktails before we even sat down. As the sun went down the gas heaters were a great addition. Our bartender/server (gosh I forget her name but she was wonderful) made sure we never lacked for thirst. There is live music and the band was setting up as we left for dinner.   If you are bothered by cigar smoke (I'm not) be aware they have a humidor and you can smoke a heater on the deck. This venue was a nice change of pace from the other bars in the area and highly recommended for date night."}
{"text":"Nice lounge but owner never calls back with the info u request regarding tables n the prices. I wanted to do a VIP thing w a patio table n 10 friends but apparently I was not important enough to get back to or they don't think we have enough money...or no rump shakers allowed."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awesome! I had the cantaloupe mule and the lavender mule and the drinks were amazing! This bar is very classy and chilled with a great rooftop deck! Will definitely be a go to spot for me when visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Atmosphere is the best...beautifully designed interior and great patio with exquisite views.  Well mixed cocktails...try the strawberry thyme royal...you won't be sorry.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Damn this place was a lot of fun! We had already been to two other bars & was in the mood to party. Saturday night is the best night to go. They had a band on the inside & a DJ (playing hip hop) on the outside. Who knew so many white people loved rap & hip hop (it was awesome to see)? The patio seating was the best & the staff was amazing. The server took our orders & returned quickly. He even started our cigars. The only downside is they DO NOT HAVE FOOD! Make sure you eat before you go here. That atmosphere was amazing, surrounded by cool people. It was a great way to close out the night (pictures attached)."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife for some event. Cool location, beautifull rooftop, great live R&B band playing.  The tapas looked good as they passed by us. I looked at a menu and it seemed to be in the $10-$12 range. My only problem was, I asked for 2 different bourbons and 2 different beers and they were out of both. Kind of killed my what could of been a positive experience.  Ehh.......this place was just OK.  2nd trip back for Raven's Events.  Wow, didn't read the owners response.  Well Sir, I know what I like and I like what I drink.  As my father said, \"Never be ashamed when it comes to YOUR money.\"  As I was ready to change my review because the experience was awesome this time. I'll keep my star rating because of the pretentious and arrogant response to my first review. Is it lonely up there on your pedestal? It's really hard to hear you from WAY up there SIR."}
{"text":"Comfortable, loungie atmosphere inside with a nice patio outside on the 2nd level of a building at Southbridge in downtown Scottsdale. There was live music the night I was there. If you sit at the bar, you order your drink off of an Ipad. In my opinion, this is very impersonal. I couldn't request a certain drink off the ipad either, so we waited to order from the bartender. He was super busy and when he finally took the time to talk to us, he didn't seem enthusiastic about making a drink that wasn't on the menu.  In the end, my drink did turn out pretty good (some mixed whiskey drink), but that's not the only reason I go to a fancy bar. I expected a friendly bartender ready to bestow some mixology wisdom on me! This didn't happen. I recommend going during happy hour, if they have one. The drinks are very expensive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The service was quick to take your order as well as bring your order. The music between the live performance was awesome and the live performer was what really made the experience! Definitely will be going there again for drinks and music.  The only downside was the creme brûlée. It seemed thrown together and was not as classy as we'd expect as compared to the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"Wow Has this place gone downhill. Now we get attitude and poor cocktail skills The people who opened this place are gone, and it shows I won't be back. Not fun any more."}
{"text":"We came to Casablanca on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday.  We thought it would be a good starting place, since it was more a lounge then a lounge/nightclub and somewhere new.  The positives were being able to talk to my friends without yelling.  The staff almost had a pin-up style look to them which gave a unique style to the place.  Drink prices are average, but the selection of Scotch's were spectacular.  The music was great playing a lot of classics we haven't heard in a while.  It was busy, but not packed. The menus had a nice lit up LCD screen that made them unique.  With that in mind, it couldn't keep us there for a long time.  The bar was very bright making the cozy atmosphere almost seem sterile.  The bar staff took forever to serve my friends, and it just wasn't one person.  A guy friend had to go to one side of the bar and a girl friend had to go to another to see who could get service first, and it wasn't even busy.  The music, albeit great, was old school hip-hop played in a classy bar with the staff dressed to form.  It'd be like going to a Chinese restaurant and listening to salsa music.  For now, I think I'd rather just hang out at Olive and Ivy and look over to see if Casablanca has gotten any better."}
{"text":"Place is always awesome. Bartenders never disappoint, always super sweet and fun and fabulous! Find Keegan! He's got some great conversations while making you fabulous drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Just a tourist passing through and saw this walking by and it looked like great space.   Friendly staff, great sunset view, good drinks. Probably a little expensive for scotsdale crowd but as a SoCal native it was decently priced.  Hope they do well."}
{"text":"Awesome patio view and a wonderful staff. Great service every time I go and the hand crafted drinks on the menu are so good! I suggest the old fashioned."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and soak in the ambiance. The drink prices reflect the high quality assortment they carry. Nice selection of single malt Scotches by the way! The outdoor patios (3) are cool. The patio allows you to enjoy a cigar with your adult beverage. Always a plus. The service was outstanding all night long."}
{"text":"I attended an event at The Casablanca Lounge, and was disappointed with the staff of the lounge.  The event went really well, but I ordered a beer (from the provided beer list with pricing), but was not charged the price on the list.  I ordered what I thought was a $5 beer, and was charged $12.50.  I was at no point told that the pricing on the beer list was happy hour only, and that happy hour pricing is not honored during events.  I will not be returning to this bar."}
{"text":"Came upon this nice rooftop lounge when I was on a walkabout in downtown Scottsdale.  It was a Wednesday night so not crowded.  Actually at first we thought we had accidently got into a bar that was closed.  But all the action was outside  You are on a roof patio so you have a nice little view.  I immediately ordered a margarita and it was great.  My friend wasn't super impressed with the wine list but their cocktails are legit.  I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale.  Love the lounge feel and being outdoors on a rooftop."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with my sisters. Night went well until it was about to be closing time and the bouncers were extremely rude and were essentially harassing my sister encouraging her to fall down the stairs. Will not return."}
{"text":"This is a nice casual upscale bar/lounge. The ambiance makes this lounge good for friendly outings or dating. They have a nice inside area and two separate outside seating areas (one including a DJ).  The drinks were good- I ordered their lemonade concoction.   The staff/servers were all very accommodating. The age range seemed to be 27-36 yrs. old. We went on a friday night and paid  a $5 cover. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I booked a ten person table on NYE. While we were looking forward to an entertaining night at this venue, as a group, we were very disappointed. For paying over $1000 on this night, we deserved better service. We are not blaming our waitress, as we understand it was a very busy night and she had a large area to cover while going up and down stairs in heels, while being subject to a lack of glassware. But the management could have organized that night a lot better. Initially, our table was not prepared, which wasn't too terrible since we arrived as doors opened for the festivities. However, we waited for a very long time for the alcohol (one hour plus).  It was not until 8:45 that we saw our server.  Once our alcohol arrived, we had no glasses, napkins, ice, water, or mixers.  It was another hour before we received any mixers or water (at this point it was 10 PM). Unfortunately after borrowing glasses from the bar upstairs, the group started to drink since we were already eating into the time we paid for. But when alcohol is involved in a large group of people, water is a must.  When one of us found a staff member to bring the group more water, unfortunately it only amounted to two wine glasses of water. Two wine glasses of water for ten people after two hours of drinking. The consumption continued throughout the night without much in the way of water or mixers.  We were told they were setting up speakers so that our table could hear music, but this never happened. The whole point of getting a booth or table was so that we could hear the music, talk with each other, and utilize a server so that we wouldn't have to push through the crowd. If our group wanted a romantic night, we would not have spent the money we did to go to a club. If we knew that it would take almost two hours to get our alcohol (as doors opened at 8 and table was not ready), then another 45min for mixers and water, no music because we were the one booth isolated from the party, and still hardly any follow up service on needing more mixers and water for the group- we would have not spent the money that we did at Casablanca. Thanks for ripping us (and what from what it sounds like- a lot of people) off. It was unfortunately a huge disappointment and we will not be returning again!"}
{"text":"I only went to see the grown and sexy local band called \"Painted Soul\" but while there I found out that Casablanca is the place to be on a Saturday night with your special someone.  It's a small place that extends to the patio.  The dancing floor is a bit tight so there's no room to really get groovy.  The menu is very limited but drinks are plenty. I suggest you go a little early before it gets too crowded later in the night."}
{"text":"Nice spot.. I liked the fact the that its a 30+ crowd. Nice balcony seating if you want to be outside. They allow you to bring your own cigar's or you can purchase from their selection. The DJs were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Came to Casablanca Lounge on a Friday night. We were the first people there and were given many free drinks to start (since it was our first time there EVER). The atmosphere was upscale and the bartenders were very awesome. There was one named Charlie who stood out from the rest!About an hour after we got there, a DJ started playing music and apparently it gets pretty packed later in the night. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"With the right company, this place is awesome!   Particularly, because the few times I've been it hasn't been crowded, it's like having the world's best bartender make craft cocktails to suit your personal palate as you sit by a fire pit and enjoy live music!   Shell, mixed a delicious Manhattan with a Croatian cherry liquor for me -- a super cool giant ice ball to keep it chilled and, after finding out about my desire to keep the calories down, treated me to an awesome tequila drink with a natural juice fresh fruit.   The pork sliders were good... but, she's right, those short rib tacos are awesome!!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. We had a table and bottle service. Dj was great. Danced the night away. Loved the patio areas. The service was pretty good. Overall a fun atmosphere and good for small groups. Enjoyed the fact that the crowd was not too young. Lots of 30 somethings. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a turn-around.  I'm really glad I gave this place another shot.  So, the week after my first visit (see previous review) I was invited back to Casablanca for a very good friend's birthday party.  There was no way I wasn't going, and I admit I was interested to see how his HUGE party would be handled compared to my previous experience.  I have to give props to both Trisha and Mandy for a job very well done.  Everything from check-in to service was well organized, the food was beautiful, seating was arranged for maximum capacity and there was still plenty of room to maneuver through the crowds.  Both Mandy and Trisha, along with Amar the owner were nice enough to speak with me about my previous concerns and acknowledge things that could've been better.  I was very impressed with their willingness to listen to their patrons.  To me, that shows a lot of promise that Casablanca will continue to improve and ultimately succeed.  I had a wonderful time with my friends at a fantastic party.  The live music was again stellar and I really appreciate the sexy and upscale vibe that's very different from other lounges in Scottsdale. Now that I've seen what this place is capable of, I would be happy to spend girl's night here again or enjoy an intimate booth with a date.  Order a Seasonal Buck and enjoy your night!"}
{"text":"My husband threw a party for 45 people to celebrate my 40th birthday here. I must say the ambiance alone was amazing. The roof top patio is very unique and perfect for celebrating with nice seating set up and beautiful views, which made for fabulous pictures! Casablanca also catered our event. I highly recommend the carnitas.  They were delicious and perfect for a large crowd. We also enjoyed the lobster grilled cheese and a few of the appetizer platters such as hummus, vegetable and bruschetta. The bartender and servers were very friendly. There were a few minor glitches having to do with the party booked before us not leaving on time, but once it was brought to the owners attention it was rectified right away.  Our guests loved the venue and had a great time. Thank you to the owner and staff at Casablanca for making my 40th so fun and memorable!"}
{"text":"We went here for a girls' night out.  We had an amazing time.  We sat outside, enjoyed reasonably priced bottle service and great 90's R&B in a cool, laid back environment."}
{"text":"What a great lounge to go to after dinner. The DJ outside on deck was playing some tunes I hadn't heard in a long time and you couldn't help but either sing along and dance or even say \" yes that is my jam. Oh and let us not forget the live band that was playing inside. *side note: you could not hear the band inside while sitting outside and vice versa. Loved that\" *  Back to the band, Vaughn Willis and the band were on fire! It was a great way to end my 40th birthday celebration. Great company, great dj, great band, great drinks, one hell of a good time!"}
{"text":"I must say the music here is ever changing and I like that... The lounge area is perfect for some fresh air,  sight seeing and have a cigar.... Yes, they have a cigar room.    This is the go to place on a Friday or Saturday night......"}
{"text":"On my 40th birthday, my girlfriends and I went there after dinner at a nearby restaurant. WE HAD A BLAST!!! It was a Friday night (grown and sexy night) and the live band was off the chain, AMAZING!!! After the band played, the DJ kept the jams rolling. Looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and thought it was a pretty cool place..I love lounges, great patio, good place to hang out with friends and have a drink.....but that was last year.    Walked in here last week on a weeknight.  There wasn't a single person in the place.  The bartender and the waitress were kinda hanging out.  Bartender hands us menus.  I ask if they have blue cheese olives to make a dirty martini.  He gives me some story about how they can't because they aren't a kitchen (huh?..whatever) and he walks back into something that looks like a kitchen.  Then he doesn't come back.  And doesn't come back.....5-10 minutes go by and we are awkwardly sitting at the bar wondering what the heck just happened?!!..  So we leave.  Clearly they didn't want to have to serve customers.  This place needs to either shut its doors or get better service that cares about keeping customers there."}
{"text":"4 stars for the patrons that attended. good looking, generally friendly, and hardly any douchebags. 2 stars for the cleanliness. I was there last night for a reserved, catered party and even though the food had run it's course on the patio, nobody cleaned it up. fantastic decor coupled with disgusting expired looking food 2 stars for the bar service. ordered drinks three times and despite being at the barfront, it took 15mins each time to get a drink - which was generally underserved and overpriced. and this wait time wasnt just because sex girls were getting served... the bartenders were just that poor 3 stars for the ambiance. music, staff, mood of the club.  2.75 stars overall. with places similar to this such as mabels and az88, i prob wouldnt go back to this place unless invited."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a table for my birthday on a Saturday night.  Mind you it's my birthday and we're going to Pop bottles and spend money like Bruno Mars in 24 Karat.  They tell us there's an entrance fee (umm, we had a reservation we made 2 weeks in advance with the Manager) even if we had a table.  Why the heck would we pay for an entrance fee if we have a table and will spend hundreds of dollars.  It's very distasteful for them not to warn us about this when I made the reservation with the manager 2 weeks in advance.  It was my birthday and I was so disappointed at the principal and the way they acted (not even apologizing, acting like total douches) my 15 person party left, all of us and our money.  No thank you!"}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend this place! We went there, because it's one place we've never tried. There was live music, which was awesome. However, the service and appetizers were horrible. The place wasn't busy at 9:00 p.m. yet it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. The appetizer choices were bad. We selected the lobster/ cheddar cheese sandwich. Soggy and tasteless for $12.00. We polished off the tasteless cheese sandwich 10 minutes before our cocktails were delivered. Later, we ordered more drinks, and the wait was equally as long for those drinks. Why??"}
{"text":"Ladies Night Out! We have finally found our perfect place!  The Casablanca team welcomed the group of eight of us with amazing hospitality and service. The venue has comfy seating, beautiful patio space and a classy upscale vibe. As a member of the late 30's club, I enjoy a chill spot with seating, live music and the ability to get a drink with ease.   The band, Ear Candy, kept us dancing and grooving all night. I cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because we had a Groupon! Came actually right when they opened on Friday and so it wasn't busy when we first got there. I know they're open late so I'm not sure how crowded they get later in the night. Sat inside because it was raining while we were there so we couldn't sit outside. Normally they do have outside seating and it's right on the waterfront so the view looked nice. Dim lighting and tiny little booths, very intimate so this would be a great spot for date night. As part of our Groupon we got a bottle of wine and then chose the charcuterie board as our appetizer. The board was an interesting assortment but everything was very good. The main reason I'm giving this review 5 stars is because of the excellent service we received. Our server was very attentive, super nice and then I'm not sure if it was the owner or manager, but he was walking around making sure everyone was doing okay too. Loved the service! Would definitely come back for another date night!"}
{"text":"Found this place via Groupon.  It has a nice vibe to it.  Hard to find though....it's located on the 2nd floor and it's not obvious how to get up there.  It's also not obvious where you should park....there are 3 options:  1 - Street parking.  However, arrive at happy hour and you'll be circling around forever trying to find a spot.  2 - Parking lot.  There are a few small parking lots around the area.  Best bet if you want to self park.  Just be careful you're not in a tow zone for a building that only allows you to park there if you go into one of their businesses.  3 - Valet lot.  There's a valet parking service that on the opposite corner of this place.  It will cost you $$$.  Once you get inside the place, it's a cool joint.  They have live music outside on the patio and if the weather is great, it will be packed out there.  The vibe inside is pretty cool too....it's dark, which I like.  I don't like lounges that are well lit....to me, that's not a lounge experience.  The food is pretty good too.  The Better Half and I shared the Short Rib Tacos ($13), Jerk Pork Sliders ($10), Pita & Hummus ($9), and the Edamame ($6).  The Short Rib Tacos were fantastic and my favorite out of the bunch.  The Sliders were good too.  The Pita & Hummus and Edamame were nice appetizers to get us started.    Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun on a Saturday night. Not your typical Scottsdale night club...thank goodness! Diverse crowd. Great dance music. Live band. Gorgeous outdoor patio high above Stetson and the canal."}
{"text":"Ok. Well last night was horrible. It started off ok. We arrived waited 20 mins at the door then were taken to our table.The table I purchased was advertised for 12 guests at a cost totaling $1483. When we sat down it was only prepped for 6! No way to seat 12 comfortably. 6 glasses for drinks & 6 for champagne! So we order Drinks and mixers and we're ready to start the night. I ordered 3 apple Ciroc and one grey goose. So out to the table comes two big apple Ciroc one small Apple Ciroc bottle and a regular vodka. I ask the girl about it and she apologized and brings the regular size Apple and never returns with grey goose. She pours our drinks which I have to help with because her arm is broken and she's struggling opening bottles and pouring them. As the night goes on we basically never had a waitress again we never had refill on mixers never had more cups no ice everything was empty all night we had to go to bar and ask for cups which they didn't have and ask them to fill up our empty cranberry craft, pineapple bottle, and orange juice bottle, And then ask Another table to use their cups. We ordered food that never came and to top it off we had no champagne ever it never arrived! We had no toast for the New Years count down! Waitresses would occasionally walk by and if we asked for something we needed it never was delivered back. The total price included mandatory tip. This establishment was completely unprepared for the New Years event and sad the patrons were the ones who had to suffer on such a special event for many!"}
{"text":"The Casablanca is officially my new favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale!  Wanna know why?  Read more!  My girlfriend and I went here on the two week anniversary of The Casablanca's opening, a Saturday night at around 10pm.  Before sitting at a table, we toured the place to see where we wanted to sit.  The decor was beautiful and would have been happy anywhere.  The weather was perfect so we wanted to sit outside, but all of the tables were reserved.  Empty, but reserved.  We grabbed a booth inside while we waited for our friend's to arrive.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress who handed us our light up menus.  That's right, these menus had fancy LED lighting in them.  It was a very cool effect that I have never seen before and it made them easier to read in the dark booth.  So not only cool, by useful.  Our friend's joined us at our booth and were also intrigued by the menu lights.  I asked the waitress for a mixed drink recommendation and she went off on how great the Seasonal Buck tastes.  Another waiter came up and also stated how it was his favorite drink.  I figured it's a new place, that's their specialty drink, everyone is raving about it, I've never had it or heard of it, so why not.  A round of Seasonal Bucks please!  The waitress brought the four drinks out and they were in this cool as hell copper mug that we all wanted to steal.  (Don't worry Casablanca, we didn't).  Then we all tried the drink.  I'd say it was a unanimous decision that it was the best tasting mixed drink each of us has ever had.  I'd go back just for this drink.  Seriously.  We had to order another round.  More friends arrived and they informed us that they had a reserved table outside with drink service.  We joined them for some Red Bull and vodkas.  Comfortable seats, perfect weather, nice views of the streets below, more friendly wait staff.  I think the lounge is going to take off once more people hear of it.  The Casablanca will definitely be my go to place when looking for a fun night out in Old Town.  There are plenty of reasons to go, but if for no other reason, go to The Casablanca Lounge for the Seasonal Buck drink.  Damn, that's a tasty drink!  PS: Just found a YouTube video on how to make the Seasonal Buck: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz1Q-cLFDDw"}
{"text":"I wouldn't know they wouldn't let me in, pretty much discriminated against.  The door man is not the owner but believes he is.  Thanks for letting me not spend money at your joint."}
{"text":"I had my B'Day party at this establishment Sat the 19th. We had a party of 12. First of all let me state that I heard abt this place on the radio 104.3. So I yelped for the reviews and checked the website.   The website indicated that they opened at 6:00 pm. Well we got there early to get seats. We found out that they do not open till 8:00 pm. The gentleman at the door indicated that 8:00 pm are the summer hours. This should have been on their website. The marketing on the radio was incorrect as well strike one.  Secondly: Once we got in and found seats for my party of 12 we tried to order snacks. The website indicated that they served a light fare of munchies. Well... No munchies at all! No food served. So my girlfriend and I walked to the Mexican restaurant on the corner to get snacks.   You may Say you should have called. Well I did call and left a mssg telling someone in the cloud that I was having a party their and wanted to reserve a space. To date I never received a call back. Strike two  Thirdly: I ordered a strawberry type of drink it was delicious my friend ordered a Raspberry Martini again delicious. We tried to order another round and a different waitress said we do not serve that kind of drink. We looked at each other and told the waitress we just order those drinks and wanted another round so you are not familiar with your own menu. Strike three  We wanted to speak to a mgr or better yet the owner but nobody knew who they were working for. Can you say strike four just for GP  Then the website indicated that there are two patios one facing old town Scottsdale the other facing Camelback Mtn. This is not true. If one of the patios face Camelback the other buildings are blocking the Mtn. Strike five  It was advertised on the radio 104.3 that there is reserved seating with bottle Svc started at $100.00. Well when we inquired about this service they indicated that this service started at $150.00. Strike six  Ok you may say darn what a bummer. Well I took my party with me so in-spite  of the false advertisement, outdated website and waitresses that did not have a clue over all we all had a great time.   The DJ was awesome and the band.....all I can say is wow. The keyboard player Josh Harley was awesome....the lead singer I met in the elevator coming into the establishment could sing to me anytime and everyday just loved loved loved them.  Overall I would not recommend this place. I recommend that you have dinner first. This is not a pickup place. If you bring your own party you will have fun. Please take heed to the six strikes that NEED TO BE RESOLVED."}
{"text":"I really like the Casablanca Lounge!  The Casablanca Lounge overlooks a small strip in the historic district of Scottsdale, Arizona.  The outdoor rooftop patio is very accommodating to cigar smokers and is arranged to be conducive to any size party.  There is a large movie screen where various films are shown (without sound), which is a neat touch, but I don't know that it really adds anything to the ambiance.  I have been to Casablanca Lounge on at least three separate occasions and each time, the inside of the lounge is empty."}
{"text":"Went to Casablanca because we heard there was a live band. Went across the street forst to another  spot that had music playing and then headed to Casablanca. It's upstairs o. 3rd floor i believe. The spot is nice and comfortable but the female singing wasn't all that great. She had a descent voice but was singing the wrong songs. I thought she did well when she sung Uptown Funk but when she went to the Jackson 5 song....i was like Whoa...  Im sure with a good band that is a nice spot to chill and enjoy. The DJ was great once the band went on break. I would go again on a better night."}
{"text":"A great new place for cocktails and edibles in a high-end atmosphere. The staff is extremely attentive, friendly, and helpful. The decor and design are impeccable, and the location is both convenient and comfortable. This place brings creativity to new heights, and combines the best of all worlds into one extraordinary place."}
{"text":"This place is a great lounge. The place was very classy. Lots of seating both indoor and out. They have a variety of liquor. Lots of high-end brands. The drink prices are a little high, but normal for a place like this.   The music in the inside area was too loud to have a conversation without yelling. But, if you were sitting outside it would have been fine. The staff seemed friendly and helpful.   This would be a great place to go with friends for drinks if you wanted a more low-key, upscale place to hang out."}
{"text":"Nice cigar bar. Good choice of drinks, great service and a perfect view of the \"Oldtown\" area. No food available but the view and service make it a great choice for a nice upscale place to chill with a cigar and Mojito.  Lighted menu's helped our aging eyes too"}
{"text":"Stopped in Casablanca on 8/16. I was in town on business.   It was winding down with very few people.   However I liked the decor and feeling. Kyle and Sarah were excellent.  Next trip I hope to catch the live music"}
{"text":"This place was really cool. You can call for a reservation or make one at Opentable.com (which is what I did).  The one complaint I had (lets get it out of the way now) is that I tried to reserve a table for 8 (girls night out) and opentable kept giving me the message that that wouldnt be possible for several months. When we got there, it was empty, and even after it filled up there were plenty of tables for a party that size wide open.  Ok. Glad I got that out of my system.  The ambiance here is great. Dimly lit, very lavish comfortable seating areas. The staff was friendly and the menus light up! I just think that thats a brilliant idea. There are so many places that I see people using their cell phone to read menus or sign their tabs. here, both the menu and tab jacket light up. They also leave an Ipad at your table that has lists of all their cocktails, beers, wines, and spirits at your table. Which was cool. I had their cocktail that has \"japanese\" in the title. It was good, but not really my thing. My second drink was mixed beautifully however. I was suprised at how limited their vodka selection was though (personal preference).  All in all, this was a great place to start the evening."}
{"text":"Really nice spot in Old Town Scottsdale. The ambience is very posh, with dim interior, two rooftop areas with pretty views at night.    If you cone at night on a weekend like we did, it's not easy finding a seat. They have lighted menus so you can see, and it's a short menu which is great - fewer choices.   Their drinks are great and the appetizers were so mouthwatering! I had eaten not too long before we went there for drinks, but this grilled cheese number they have... couldn't resist... worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here on a double date as we all wanted to listen to live music in a lounge environment and Kazimierz's had a long line winding from it's front doors, and we just weren't havin' that nonsense.  The venue is pretty dark and sultry, but sexy. On this particular Saturday night, there was a Jazz musician and he was GOOD! But, it shouldn't have been so loud because of the smaller space, Jazz genre, and being a lounge... you want to converse without shouting/lip-reading, right? Sigh. Maybe I have aging dog ears, but some notes he hit truly pained me, causing me to utterly wince, and this isn't a pleasant experience. But he was talented and had passion!  We only stayed for 1 round of drinks and decided that due to the noise level, we would relocate to a quieter place to eat and shoot the shit. While we were there, menu items/drinks looked appealing and service was friendly and quick. ** NOTE: I liked that they fully considered how dark their venue is and made their menus automatically illuminate so you can read food/drink selections. Cool touch! I'd definitely try this venue again!"}
{"text":"Great little nightlife spot in Old Town. Friday nights Are hip-hop/R&B with live music then DJ. The spot has a private VIP lounge, dance area, and patio partying in different areas. The doorman, host, service staff and servers are wonderful to work with. The Promoters for table service are also very nice. The lounge is neat and classy. It's always a good time with a great crowd.   The food is very good here. Plenty of tables to sit down and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"This was the furthest thing from Rick's Cafe American that has ever existed."}
{"text":"Loud!! I can't hear myself think. The music was unnecessarily loud both times I went here. Bring your earplugs and it might be tolerable. Really loud karaoke sounding band on Wednesday night... So fun!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. You feel like you're in an exclusive speakeasy. There is a pleasure associated with sipping a refreshing cocktail on a warm day, while looking out over bustling old town Scottsdale. Great view of the camel's hump as well."}
{"text":"This is my go to and send to for anyone visiting or a local.  Love the drink selection and recipes.  All the mixologists are spot on ith presentation and palate selection.  If you're looking to get a vodka soda or something to that degree you may want to try something out of your comfort zone and go with their specialty cocktails.  It's got great outdoor and indoor seating for groups and one-on-one type convo which is great.  Days for being busy and energetic are hit and miss but it's more of a place to enjoy the people your with and maybe starting light conversation with a fellow patron.  Everyone is always very polite, professional and knowledable.  They also have a private room for rent for private parties which is great as well.  Always my go to for any type of classy or casual occassion."}
{"text":"Alex the bartender made this a great experience. I wanted a drink that I had in another state and he took a stab at making it. It didn't taste the same but it was great, I ordered another. We got there right as happy hour started, the cook wasn't in so he made the lobster Mac & Cheese himself. If you like to sit at the bar they could use more bar stools."}
{"text":"Our 4 person group stopped here for a drink before dinner and were pleasantly surprised! Although it took us a minute to figure out how to get to the lounge, it surpassed out expectations! The atmosphere was perfect for cocktails and the outdoor space with a fire pit was wonderful. I had a \"seasonal mule\" and it was quite possibly the best drink I've ever had! The live music was a very nice touch also. Would definitely recommend and looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The bar is superb. Rich and Tyson are the real deal. This is the only place I've been to in a Red State that matches the authentic quality of East Coast bars.   Food? Never tried it, and who cares? Go to Applebees for that. A bar is all about the drinks, the bar tenders' personality and service, and the vibe. I will definitely be coming back.  (Anyone who is a regular, feel free to connect with me. I just moved to Phoenix from Boston and I'm looking for other expats...or those who are East Coast at heart)"}
{"text":"I love Casablanca, every time I'm in town i make sure to stop by and enjoy a delicious cocktail. This place is a staple in my Scottsdale itinerary. I highly recommend you grab some friends and start your night here."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in here last night around 9 for drinks and music.  What a great setting, we loved the vibe.  We are in our late 30's (ugh can't believe I just said that) just looking to chill, not party.  The vibe here is perfect for that, exactly what we were expecting/wanting.  The rooftop section is gorgeous, we sat out there a bit then moved inside when the band started up.  We got a seat immediately but the longer we sat the busier it got.  I'll remember to get there early, especially if we have a group.  The drinks are pricey, to be expected for a venue such as this, but the pours are too small.  My husband's first old fashioned was literally 2 swallows, with his second old fashioned being about 3 times as large.  Not sure if they made a mistake?  I don't like inconsistency.  Also, I was expecting a lounge with such a great 'theme' to have some amazing craft cocktails but the list was unimpressive at best.  A little disappointing.   That being said, the band was phenomenal and fit the atmosphere of this old school lounge.  We will be regulars whenever we get the chance to go out and about later at night without our kids in tow! Thanks Casablanca for providing a more classy establishment compared with the majority of loud bars/clubs in downtown Scottsdale.  Not everyone likes to get sloppy drunk and party!"}
{"text":"I'm very discouraged. . I've called 3 times and left vmails trying to make a reservation.  No one returns calls. I've sent an email... no one replies. I've been the before and liked the venue but it's not that serious to have to chase them down to reserve and spend my money.  I may just look elsewhere.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Fun location and the layout makes for an eventful night...Bathrooms were pretty clean so that is a big plus for a night club"}
{"text":"Classy, fun, and comfortable. Friday night live band playing R&B and Hip Hop hits always delivers great entertainment."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a couple drinks around 5 pm on a Saturday night.  Looks like more of a club than an evening hangout. There were only about 10 other people there.  DJ was playing 80's/early 90's R&B, so if that's your style, roll in here.  Small selection of apps, but we just came for drinks.  Great patio.  Friendly staff.  A decent place to grab a drink if you're in Old Town."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and there was live music! Unfortunately, not the best live music. The drinks were fantastic and the service was good all but the doorman. The outside waitress was extremely helpful and accommodating with seating. The ambiance was so beautiful but I wish the music was better. If you bring in an amazing singer and band it would make a difference.  I would suggest LadeeJ or Rosco for live entertainment and it will change the game."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time there. Live Music and environment was excellent. They also have a. Wet good food menu."}
{"text":"Stacey our server was Top Notch. The food was awesome. I recommend the cheese board and the chicken wings and the rose a champagne worth $100 bottle when I come back Scottsdale I'm definitely going back to Casablanca"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible!!!  Subtract stars!!!!  Patio singer was great and we decided to check it out.  We became a party of 7, continuously ordering drinks for 3 hours...Only to have an employee come by our section and put a sign on the table indicating it \"Reserved\", while we're there.  She then came by a few minutes later and told us we had to get up from our section and stand somewhere else unless we ordered a bottle!!  They wanted the section free in case anyone showed up and was willing to order a bottle-otherwise, it would sit empty.  What kind of \"business\" does that to paying customers??!!  We live within walking distance and frequent a number of the places there.  Will NEVER go back there...EVER!!!!  And I let everyone I know and meet what occurred.  Go to KAZIMER across the street.  Awesome live bands and they don't KICK you out of your seats!!!"}
{"text":"If, I could give it a negative star I would. We made a 7 dinner reservation and then were called to say it was 7:30. then a text saying it had been changed to 8pm. Once we got there they 'apologized' but they don't serve food anymore. No accommodations for maybe some drinks to make up for the inconvenience. They indicated that they had to let their chef go and did not give a courtesy call to let us know. We had friends came out  for a special event and they traveled from tempe which made me look like so improper. So inconvenient. When I called to talk to the Manager she was very sarcastic to me and said to me \" I can keep my reservation and I will go in the  kitchen and make  your food for you \" So rude!! Stay clear of this place!   ***In response to your email Samantha whom made the booking my friend she has email confirmation and text messages to prove that reservations made and she spoke with Ashley to make the reservation, there was no communication, there was a lack of care for the customer and owning up the mistake while we were present. Samantha stated she will be in touch with the manager.***"}
{"text":"Finally a place in AZ, I can actually dance in without feeling like the odd ball. Decent size dance floor with a stage (only for after the live entertainment is finish) two outdoor patios, one side has heaters the other side has a fire pit. There are two DJ's at this spot one inside and out (got to love that) keep the party going.  The restrooms are clean and have no waiting lines. Tons of room for sitting and VIP areas. The Strawberry Martini that the bartender made me had fresh crushed strawberries and was on point. Must I add the shots here ALL top shelf tequila may just do the trick, by only the first two hits LOL.  I gave Casablanca four stars because the DJ inside wasn't really paying attention to the crowd body language is key. Too many slow jams people were complaining and waiting for a faster beat. Faster songs more shots and drinks were flying just an FYI.  Now that that's all out; will I return a little visit? Yes, why not!!! I may have to bring a bit more friends this time grab a bigger table and dance my boot'a off."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 2nd shot a few months after our 1st experience.  Service was terrible both times.  No music.  the movie outside was distracting because it was complete silence and this bright movie.    Cocktails are VERY over priced especially for the amature \"mixologists\".  I will not go back or suggest this place.  I am shocked they are still in business.  Sad because it could be very cool."}
{"text":"They way over charge for drinks! We had vodka and redbulls, they charged $12 for the vodka (1 shot kettle one) and $4 for the redbull. So basically $16 each drink. Not to mention the drinks were very small and mostly ice. They charged us for 8 drinks when we only ordered 6. Horrible service! The dance floor is tiny but music is good. Don't waste you money on this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars; one for having good food and drinks and one for having a great atmosphere.  However I did not feel like I had a good experience here last night.  A Group of friends and I sat on the patio last night. The gentleman in our group was about 150 pounds and he sat in one of the patio chairs.  Within the first 10 minutes of arriving one of the legs on the chair broke and my friend fell flat on his back on the patio. The manager or supervisor never came over to make sure he was OK and not injured. Later in the night a server brought over an extra martini that we did not order. We triple check to make sure that everyone had a drink before she set it down and we said we did not order that, everyone has their drink nobody is done with their drink yet. She left it on the table and said \"I'm sure someone will drink this if I leave it here\" and still charged us for that drink that nobody drank. Finally when it came time to go I was in a little bit of a rush to get home when I realize the server hadn't come back to our table for half an hour.  It took us half an hour to get our check, we had to stand up and get her attention to come over and bring us the check. This place is beautiful with a great atmosphere and great food and drinks and has such potential to be five stars. Unfortunately, The experience we had was terrible."}
{"text":"My friend and I just went in, asked for cocktail menus, and then sat for 20 minutes trying to get the bartenders attention to take our orde.r, while he immediately took the orders of groups of men who .walked up to the bar. It wasn't even crowded and it was completely futile to get a drink in there. Needless to say we walked out drinkless."}
{"text":"Really cool joint. Very nice view from the deck, excellent music, good drinks. The food is a little different but really good. A great way to spend an evening out!"}
{"text":"I love this place, its great for hanging with friends over some very fabulous cocktails or just chill'n with your fave. The rooftop patio is really awesome but with the warmer weather I love the inside too!"}
{"text":"Never book a party here!!!   I have to first say that the waitstaff and bartender who worked our party were great, but the party planner is an idiot!  Our party was suppose to be from 7 to 10 on the patio.  We were told that they opened at 6 so we showed up at 6:30 set up for our party only to find that they had booked another party on the patio the same day from 3 to 7. (This is kind of funny since we asked to use the inside party room and were told we couldn't because there was a party there starting at 10.)   We had no time to set up before the birthday girl arrived and had to fight to get the DJ from the previous party to leave so that would could finally set up. Also they were suppose to \"rope off\" part of the patio for our party, but they had nothing (not even a sign) to indicate that it was a private party so we had people eating our food and sitting with our party (can't really blame them since they had no idea it was a private party).  The food was mediocre and they had no lighting on the food tables so you couldn't even see what there was which I think lead to most of the food going to waste.   Luckily, like I said the waitstaff and bartender were great, so we manage to have a good time despite the stressful way the night started."}
{"text":"I was looking for live music and stumbled across this gem of Old Town! Aside from an amazing band (Ear Candy) the view from the rooftop patio was stunning. They had a small appetizer style menu... Lobster Grilled Cheese? ! Yes please! I had the Lavender Mule to drink & was thoroughly impressed... Edible orchid infused ice cubes?! Yep! Though I don't get out often, I highly recommend Casablanca and will be back the next time I have a babysitter!"}
{"text":"No live music on Sat! Very very dark . Very loud .... not a fan. Artist outside painting ... was cool. Smoky."}
{"text":"The band and music is always great. There is always a crowd. I invite all R&B lovers to come out on Saturday nights. It is free and always a good time. Plenty of comfortable lounge chairs for a nice evening enjoying good R&B music both from the live band until midnight and then an awesome DJ takes over. They also have a cigar bar area on the balcony outside. The menu items are perfect for the evening."}
{"text":"This place is great! My group of friends and I enjoyed the outdoor atmosphere. The manager Viet was very nice and set us up in a really cool seating area.  We'll be back to visit this place the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the music outside in the patio. The one thing that pissed me off was the bartender charged my friend and I $6 for beers. I went back an hour later and ordered the same beer from the same bartender and he charged me $5 for the same beer. Wtf??!!"}
{"text":"Casablanca Lounge is such a fun hidden gem in Scottsdale, Arizona.   Here is why it's awesome: -Beautiful, classy interior: dim lighting, high back booths for privacy -Service is always kind, courteous, respectful and attentive -Music has never let me down (depends on what you like)  -Theme nights: 2 weekends ago I went for Reggae night and it was so much fun!  -Outside roof lounge area, with plenty of comfortable Canopy seating and a great view of the city. -Music easily can be enjoyed outside too -Cigar roller if you're feeling extra fancy   Drinks are fancy, so they are a bit pricier- but that is to be expected given the alcohol brands. Drinks are delicious here!   Always have a great time. Careful taking the stairs back down if you're tipsy!"}
{"text":"without a doubt the worst service I have ever received ... last night, Thursday Oct 24th, we arrived at the lounge which is absolutely beautiful ... a band was playing and they were wonderful ... we were three of maybe 20 customers in the entire place and we took seats at the bar. it took a good 8 to 10 minutes for the bartender to get to us although we were trying to get her attention ... she appeared to be a new bartender as she was searching for bottles and did not seem to know the location of things behind the bar. we enjoyed our cocktails and listened to the band, after about 25 or 30 minutes I was ready for another cocktail, try as I may I could not get the bartenders attention, mind you, at this point there were maybe only 10 customers in the entire bar including the patio area ... I finally got the attention of the manager who came behind the bar and he got me a second cocktail.  during the time that he was getting my cocktail the band took a break between sets, when the band was ready to start the final set, it took about 7 or 8 minutes for them over the microphone to get the attention of the manager and bartender to turn off the house music ... at this point there are only 5 people in the bar who were all laughing because it was so funny that the band could not get the attention of the employees, the manager finally turned off the house music and the band began playing the final set, at this point my two friends were ready for their second cocktail and we again could not get the attention of the bartender or the manager ... we were literally waving our arms for a good 5 minutes trying to get their attention, I finally got up from my seat and walked to the end of the bar where the manager was socializing with the bartender and I asked him if I could speak to him for a moment to which she said sure and stepped from behind the bar to talk to me and I explained to him that although the bar was beautiful and the band was very engaging and wonderful that the service was absolutely horrible ... his response was, and I quote \" well then I think you've had enough and you guys should leave\", absolutely no apology for the poor service, just told us to leave, mind you, my friends were still waiting for just thier secnd drink and I was still enjoy my second. I absolutely will not be back and I will be contacting the general manager to discuss the situation.  On a side note, The manager on duty seemed to be flirting and making himself very familiar with the bartender. I did pay my $30 tab and tipped the bartender $5 ... even though the service was very slow, she was friendly and again it was obvious that she was new.  The managers attitude on the other hand was horrific and completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Loved the live music (Thursday night) as well as the ambience.  Had an old Audrey Hepburn movie playing in the background (Breakfast at Tiffany's, I think?) outside on the deck.  Great place to have it and a nice set up.  Wasn't overly crowded either.  Considering there weren't that many people, service was a bit slow.  Drinks are also on the pricier side too.  But I'd come back, esp. if there's live music."}
{"text":"to the extent that this site is for rating places according to their food, please ignore this post.  We did not eat here, just came in to hear the \"live\" music.  Caveat for those of you who think that \"live\" music connotes human being(s) playing some kind of instrument (s), usually with vocal accompaniment.  A guy with all kinds of fancy electronics and lighting, thumping out mixes of dance-inducing R&B, as talented as the guy was here, is not \"live\" music and should not be advertised as such, IMHO.  That said, the Saturday night crowd was having a great time, and the patio seemed like a very nice setting for dining out above the fray."}
{"text":"I love playing here. There's always a nice mix of people. Never heard about anybody getting shot here or and fights breaking out here. Now I've seen some drunk people fall. I've met some great people. Also met some celebrities I thought I'd never meet. And as a drummer it really is one of the best places in old town to play at. Because I always keep it 1000 my only gripe as a musician is the route to germ drums up to the 3rd floor sucks but it's totally worth it. No matter what time you come here it will most definitely be a good experience. Beautiful classy staff as well what more can ya ask for."}
{"text":"I went here for my 21st birthday last night and I do not think I could have had a better time. It started when my friends and I arrived and was greeted by Taylor the Hostess who was so welcoming and friendly. Trisha the event coordinator was absolutely amazing and so accommodating to my every wish. We sat outside on the patio by the fire pit, and it was probably the best seat in the house It was so comfortable for my 15-20 person party. Ashley was our server and she was the best. She had great recommendations and knew EXACTLY what she was talking about when it came to explaining all the different drinks. Rich the Bar Manager was just as wonderful and even created a special drink for my birthday so my friends and I could enjoy something personalized just for me. Prices were totally fair, music was great to dance to outside, and the view from the patio was to die for. I am so so happy I came here for my birthday, and will continue to come here. Again thank you so much everyone. :)"}
{"text":"I always have a good time when I come here. I don't go to people watch or even really to drink, I come for the dj on the patio. He kills it everytime, and I am so obsessed with him. He plays all of the music I grew up listening to..east coast hip hop, reggae, to name a few. I don't know his name, but I tell everyone about his skills, and people that frequent the spot, all agree....he is on point!! I will be making a trip there soon so I can!"}
{"text":"When it comes to hospitality, Rikee at Casablanca takes care of it all. Whether you want to book a corporate event, a nice date with special attention to detail, or a fun night out with friends, Casablanca has all the ingredients and potential for a memorable time! I am really looking forward to returning to the area during Spring Training to soak in some baseball, sunshine, cervezas, and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Casa Blanca has a beautiful view of the city. Romantic with fire pits. Nice background music. Staff very nice. Good for a romantic evening or to gather with friends."}
{"text":"Definitely the best spot to start your night! Awesome atmosphere and amazing hospitality."}
{"text":"Needed a night out with the girls. Wanted something relaxed, classy. Good spot, No cover, reasonable drinks. They don't serve food anymore on Friday nights, but we were able to get a cheese plate out of the kitchen : )  Crowd appeared 30's and Up. Music was a mixture...."}
{"text":"This was the last of 5 stops on our Valentine's celebration adventure. What can I say, my man knows I have to see the town. After Kazimierz we were elated to actually have a cushy place to sit, with service! The entertainment and crowd were more of the mid 40s-50s variety but we had a good time. And I appreciated a little ethnic diversity here in Scottsdale (a bit more like I was back home in L.A.). I got up to join in on the Cupid Shuffle at one point, and my watermelon cocktail (while heavy on the jalapeno) was refreshing."}
{"text":"I attended a private party in the speakeasy.  It was quite a fantastic set up!  Super cozy and intimate with a decent sized patio and pool table.  Television, couches, chairs.  It was really great.  The ordering was a bit confusing, there was an ipad involved but it was just easier to ask to server for what we wanted."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Thursday evening and waited 10 minutes to be seated, some one walked up to us and in a matter of fact way said \"sit any where\" and also said it's a slow night we only have 2 wait staff. We then waited another 15 minutes and one of the staff brought ONE glass of water for two of us. About 5 minutes later another glass of water and the drinks menu. 20 minutes later and no one came by to take our order, then a few minutes later we were told they were not serving dinner on Thursday's (this was at 7.30PM) he also said I'll buy you a free drink cause you waited so long - we left! He can take the free drink and ... I understand the challenges but the cheap unprofessional attitude surprises me. Won't return!"}
{"text":"I just love the patio here.  And actually there are two patios.  One faces more the city of Scottsdale, but the real gem is the one on canal with the tall buildings in the background.  I would love to come here to see the sunset.  Also, the band we saw was very good but not really my cup of tea.  I would like to try again with a more jazz or blues band.  The drinks are really good too.  I had a Moscow Mule but they have some other mixed drinks too.  We also had a chochloate lava cake that was really delicious.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Update review::: Casablanca lounge invited me back and it was wonderful they treated me so well they comped what I had paid for on NYE and it was great the treatment I received was so wonderful thank you to Ashlyn and Kristina and the staff and also thank you to Cody for handling everything so professionally.. I really appreciate it. You GUYS ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere, with great music and drinks. However, the ladies restroom was poorly maintained and needs some repairs. I was also disappointed that I paid for tickets through their website for the Labor Day Weekend event, and when we showed up there was no line, no cover and the place wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Horrible place! Mangers and bartenders are very rude! I'm a bartender and I will never treat ppl the way they do. They hate friday nights with African Americans.. They all act like we don't tip!! It's sad.. We're all not the same. But they see why all the other clubs in the area out beat them every weekend.. Because they don't know how to treat ppl!"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is really neat. It's dim and intimate inside (in fact, it's so dim they have to give you a menu that lights up!) and they have some really comfy chairs to sit on. The DJ who was working on Saturday night was playing some fun music, but the volume was a little too loud for a \"lounge.\"  I could only talk to the people sitting immediately next to me, and even then I had to yell a little.  The patio was a nice escape from the loud music.  They had a lot of seating out there and a nice view of the courtyard to people watch."}
{"text":"Interesting spot that I have been to a few different times. The service can be good some nights and poor other nights. They have a decent selection of cocktails whiskeys and other drinks. Has live music most of the time. Best part of the place is the Outdoor patios. Up on the 2nd and 3rd floor you can Overlook Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow Worst service ever We came in and sat down and no waitress ever came by to visit us When we finally asked for a waitress she came over and asked us what do you want  Our response was menus would be nice No refills of  water we were just pretty much ignored the rest of the night We put a credit card down to hold open a tab Then tried to pay cash and that confused the waitresses even further As I write this review we are  still waiting for the cash and the credit card and a manager it's been 15 minutes"}
{"text":"This is a great, comfortable place to hangout, meet friends, dance and enjoy good appetizers and great drinks. They always have a friendly crowd you can have cigars on the outdoor patio that is very large with a nice fireplace, heaters and a great view of downtown Scottsdale. The live band is terrific, they play a great combo of contemporary pop, Motown, and disco. Service is great the services are attentive and friendly. Great place to stop in after dinner."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night, must have been after a happy hour crush as the outdoor patio was mostly empty but the place was trashed with un bused tables with leftovers and empty glasses.  Gross.  BTW the inside area had no seating up other than the three booths across from the bar.  If you didn't know there was an outside rooftop seating area, you would think the place had closed down.  They need to make the bar MUCH more presentable when you enter the front door."}
{"text":"Wow, lots of interesting and covert language about urban music and attracting the \"wrong crowd\" in Richard's reply to my review. Also note the frown upon \"booty shaking\" as if that's not a fairly universal pastime amongst all age and race demographics. Other cultures may call it \"boot scooting\" or \"shaking a tailfeather\", but the concept is the same Richard.   I get your point though, you don't want people moving rhythmically at Casablanca. You want them to be sedate. Got it!  I'd encourage Richard to maybe visit SumoMaya and other upscale establishments in Scottsdale that cater to the \"lounge\" crowd Casablanca aspires to attract. They play current pop music (the kind that's on the radio and pop charts!!) and some rap (!!) and still manage to attract a classy, mature, sophisticated crowd. It's regretful Casablanca couldn't pull this off, but IMO wrong to blame a genre of music for their failure to attract the \"right crowd\" to their establishment.   Also just who is \"the wrong crowd\", Richard? We who frequented Casablanca Lounge when the music was better are all childless professionals with disposable income who've traveled extensively. I have a career in Wealth Management. My girlfriends who I frequented this establishment with are Vice Presidents of Strategy, Directors of Operations, Business Analysts, District Managers, etc.. So, professional women who like to dance (and yes BOOTY SHAKE!) on the weekend are amongst the wrong crowd Richard would prefer not to have at Casablanca Lounge? Interesting and GREAT to know!!  Lastly, maybe they should update their menu to highlight these many cocktails that cost less than $12 or $14 instead of leaving patrons the responsibilty to \"guess\" drinks that may be better priced, but are nowhere to be found on the menu?"}
{"text":"Casablanca. With a name like that you expect great things. What comes to mind for me is the movie, which could very easily go down as one of the top ten films of all time. Casablanca might go down as one of my top ten worst dining/going out experiences of all time, so I guess there is SOME similarity? That's stretching it...  I am going to relate my experience here to the early stages of dating. You meet the guy and the first impression is fantastic. You even think \"Oh my gosh, maybe he's THE ONE!\" and you can't wait to spend time with them. Maybe you meet for drinks for the first date, the guy was late, but you have delish drinks and great convo. You can't wait for a second date. Second date, you go to dinner. the food takes almost an hour to come out and is awful but you don't want to be a debbie downer and say anything. You pick at it in awkward silence as suddenly the glamour of what could have been has worn off and you realize you don't have much to say to this guy. But hey, maybe it was an \"off\" night. Then the guy pulls the whole \"I forgot my wallet\" act and you are stuck with the bill for something you didn't even enjoy in the first place. On top of that, there are items on the bill you didn't even order, but you just want to get the heck out of there so you pay. There are lots of apologies, he still tries to kiss you, and you leave irritated and pissed off wishing you had those two hours back, BUT that musician at the restaurant was super hot. Hmmm, wonder if he is single?   Casablanca looks great and sends out a great vibe. I was initially excited we were kicking off the evening there. Then to discover they weren't ready for our group (and they had weeks of notice) and made us stand around while they pushed tables together, etc. AWKWARD. The light up menus and drinks were fun and began to turn things around for me. I LOVED their seasonal drink and the Sophia bubbly. Then the food came (literally after an hour of us ordering it, I don't think most realized this otherwise we all probably would have been disgruntled a lot sooner) The food is a JOKE. The cheese and meat plate, all I could think was \"WTF?\" It was pathetic. We all had the thought about Postino being way better. But to be honest, I can't even help you understand how bad it was. The fact that a classy Scottsdale joint would serve that to their patrons (with a $25 price tag) and think people will be okay with it blows my mind. Tiny pieces of cheese. Pre packaged, presliced salami. Crackers I can find at Safeway. The hummus, also pathetic. It should be called the tzatziki plate. And we were given maybe three pieces of actual pita and told they were going to charge us for more. WOW. The blue cheese olives were the only thing I found yum, unique and not disappointing.   Now we get to the fun part. The god awful service. Some girls got there late so I decided to hunt down our server so they could order a drink before we left. I was wandering for five minutes (and the place is not very big) before someone FINALLY asked if I needed help. I don't blame our server for this at all. This is management and the event coordinator's fault. (Oh, and the event coordinator, I'd like to know what exactly her job is. She greeted us, said she'd be back to get us a round of drinks and was never to be found again. It wasn't that busy nor did it look like there were any other large groups there) The manager finally came out as if to our rescue and made things worse. I would rather have dealt with the newbie server and walked her through it patiently. Instead it took us 30 minutes to sort out the bill, which was separated into eight difference checks (when we had asked that three of us get put on one to \"make it easy\", we were charged for items we didn't order, and even when they \"fixed\" it there were errors but we just rolled with it because we so desparately wanted to leave.   Luckily we went to Mabel's after which was a 5 star experience so the night was quickly redeemed and we had a BLAST.   The ONLY reason this place gets two stars instead of one: The entertainment was AMAZING and the place has potential to be better. I really hope they get their act together."}
