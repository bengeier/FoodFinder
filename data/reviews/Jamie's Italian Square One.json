{"text":"Food portion was good. I had the prawn linguine. It was okay nothing special. I also got the meat plank. They said it'd be good for 3 people but no it's only good really for 2 as an appetizer. Ambiance and decor of the place was really nice. Our server was very attentive and quick. Dessert was overpriced though for items you can get anywhere else. I would come back but would not be in a rush."}
{"text":"Jamie's Italian at Square One was mediocre at best. I shared the Italian Hot Pizza and the Porcini Fettuccine for lunch. The flavour of the pizza was very underwhelming. I prefer the pizza crust thin but this pizza crust was so wafer thin, it definitely could not support many toppings.  Incidentally, the toppings were scant for a $17.95 pizza. The Porcini Fettuccine was definitely better than the pizza but still not a dish I would recommend. The flavour of the dish was appetizing but the portion size for $18.95 was slightly meager. The pasta also tasted better with the seasoned bread crumbs mixed in, which came separately on a spoon. I found the food somewhat lacking and overpriced. The d√©cor inside was rustic and aesthetically pleasing. I asked to dine in the patio but later regretted my dismal view of just the parking lot. Our server was great - relaxed but attentive and efficient. There was a notable food stain on one of the glasses but it was quickly replaced once mentioned to our server. All things considered, I probably would not revisit Jamie's Italian at Square One again."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday last night. We were collectively unimpressed. The atmosphere is lively and even though it was busy, the staff were extremely polite and attentive. We were originally at a table where some ceiling condensation kept falling on our table. After bringing it to the attention of our server they promptly moved us, which we appreciated. We got some bellinis which were ok; maybe it was the fruit they used, but it tasted kinda syrupy.  Now on to the food. We got the bruschetta and the calamari to share. The bruschetta was literally one piece of bread. It looked beautiful, but tasted like an herb garden was blended into a paste and spread on a piece of bread. The calamari was ok, but again the portion was ridiculously small. For our mains we got the gnocchi and the ravioli. The gnocchi was completely unmemorable and way too herbaceous. I had a piece of the ravioli...meh. For dessert we got the lemon meringue cheesecake which was very good. Definitely the best part of the meal.   Overall, a mediocre experience at inflated prices. Meh."}
{"text":"I visited Jamie's Italian one month after it opened. I was quite disappointed by my meal and also the service. To start off I liked the rustic ambience and the look of the restaurant. I sat at a large booth that was very comfortable. The hostesses at the front requested that I leave my baby stroller at the front of the restaurant by the door. I complied and carried my baby with my diaper bag and purse into the restaurant. I noticed that there were 3 other guests who were allowed their strollers by their tables so I was a bit confused. The restaurant was mostly empty because it was 2pm on a wednesday.  For apps I ordered the crispy squid and \"rice balls\" (I cant remember what it is called on the menu) both were very bland and had very little flavour or seasoning. I was extremely underwhelmed.  I also ordered the crab spaghetti. My server brought the wrong order out and gave me the prawn linguine. My friend ordered the bolognese pasta. I informed the server that he had the wrong order.  He didn't apologize but offered to bring me the right order. My friend had already started her meal so I said I would keep the prawn linguine so I wouldn't have to wait.  There was something terribly wrong with the prawn linguine. It was soooo extremely salty!  Like the chef had accidentally dumped the salt into the plate. I am a sodium fanatic and love very salty food but this was exceptionally salty! I have read many positive reviews about the prawn linguine so I am guessing this mistake was a one time thing. It was so bad I wanted to ask the server to take it back and make me anything else that wouldn't take a lot of time to prepare. However, my server didn't come back to check on us. He was sitting at a table speaking to someone who I assumed to be the manager. My friend's wine glass was empty and she was trying to wave someone down to refill it. By the time my server finished his meeting and returned, my friend was finished eating and I had managed to get down half my plate before I gave up. I had picked out the 5-6 prawns in the plate and tried to have some of the pasta but it was just too salty. By then it was too late to order something else.  My friend ordered another glass of wine after her plate was already finished. My server didn't ask how my meal was after seeing my half uneaten plate nor did he ask if I wanted to pack it to go.  Overall, the poor service and salty food experience were definitely not worth the $100 for lunch. I am willing to give it one more try since it is still a new restaurant. I really want to try other items on the menu because they look well crafted and interesting but I am afraid of having another terribly made meal."}
{"text":"Was looking very forward to going to this restaurant, the menu reads great but when the dishes arrive they don't deliver as expected. Antipasto board was pitiful. Tiny slice of mortadella and prosciutto and a few pickled veg. Wife's pappardelle was tasty but a little dry, my porchetta was all fat not much meat . Our server was quite pleasant and new the menu well and had good suggestions . Prices were better than I thought they would be ."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this restaurant by Jamie Oliver.  After almost an hour waiting for a table (they don't take reservations), I was disappointed with the calamari appetizer.  The preparation was great and very tasty, but the serving was sooo small.  There were maybe 7 ir 8 small pieces of calamari.  For a price of $12.99? I mean, seriously.  The main courses were not much better and while the food was good, the portions were small.  The biggest disappointment was the desert.  $10 for a little piece of tiramisu.    All through dinner, they were blasting the music really loudly.  It sounded more like a bar than a restaurant.  The only positive about this experience was that our waiter was nice and prompt."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the pesto gnocchi with purple potatoes. I recommend the tiramisu dessert. The service and food were great. The flavours, the crunch and textures in the pasta was terrific.  I do recommend this place for a nice experience or to meet people after work."}
{"text":"So it was my first time going there today evening. I've heard a lot about this restaurant from my friends who are in the UK and I couldn't wait to try it out. I must say it was one of the best Italian food that I've ever had. The pasta was just delicious and not to mention the appetizers are a must eat. Plus the ambience is very nice. A little bit pricy but it's worth visiting."}
{"text":"Giving Jamie a bad name! My family was so disappointed. The food was below average and just OK at best. The serving sizes range from extremely small to a medium on the smaller side. I would not recommend the salads at all as the sizing is really off - even our server confused the large salad as a small. I can't even begin to wonder how tiny the small size is!  I'm obviously not Italian but imo... Taste-wise, The pizza was average. Pasta was average (I had some cream based ravioli). The milanese was good (you can't go wrong with tenderized, breaded turkey), but for the price point on all of these I would recommend going elsewhere, like Papa Giuseppes,15 minutes away in Port Credit.  Something awkward about the plating and offering of the mains is that they do not come with any sides like most restaurants would (vegetables? potatoes?), unless stated in the description. So when they brought us our turkey milanese, it was served to us on a lonely plate and it just felt like a barren meal. It just leaves you... wanting more of a meal but who wants to pay an extra $4 for potato chips!  Points for the nice decor, delicious gelato and the server/manager were extremely kind.  We did go to the restaurant during the first few days that it opened, so hopefully they worked out some of the kinks we experienced.  In sum, this place is just your typical, westernized Italian chain restaurant. Don't let the Jamie Oliver branding fool you!"}
{"text":"Costly, small portions, not amazing flavours. My friends and I were still hungry after 2 appy's and mains.....Disappointed with the experience although the decor was awesome. I guess I had higher expectations bc it's Jamie Oliver... Wouldn't return here...."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since it opened. Always have had friendly service, orders are done right, food is fresh. Usually have gotten the pizza and pasta, some of their cocktails and desserts. All in all a good resto.  Only complaint? Price. Food is good but it is a little over priced for what you get. Protions are too small for the price, again drive the 20 minutes to Toronto and you can get better food at the same price with good portions."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is awful. Servers make you feel uncomfortable and rush you. No smiles. Disappointing to the max and not worthy of having the name Jamie Oliver on this resto."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing so say the least. The service was pretty bad . Nice  enough waitress but she didn't really seem to care much about our order and what was missing and what we needed and how everything was ...and didn't bother to acknowledge when someone joined the table a bit later. Like not even an offer of water. Luckily we were done our meals so we left to go to a better restaurant in the same mall with way better service. It really doesn't take much. The food was okay but nothing that would make me return or recommend. I would say a Jamie Oliver restaurant fail and surely he would be embarrassed.."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times but after today's experience, I am never going back. I went there for my mom's birthday with my family and brought a cake in to celebrate. The manager, Alicia made us charge $3 per plate, a total of $9. When we spoke to the manager about the plating fee, she said it's because they plate and cut the cake for us. For the record, the cake was not cut for us and a knife was not even given to us in the first place, we had to keep asking for it. Extremely poor customer service from the manager and the staff. I do not recommend hosting birthday parties here because their service is not accommodating in any way.  To the manager, Alicia: You and your staff should learn a thing or two from The Keg, Moxies or Earls where they do not just allow outside birthday cakes but also initiate to fridge the cake, present and provide a plenty of plates and forks and knife."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here! Sat on the patio and it was wonderful weather! It faces the parking lot, and the view is often ruined by cars with obnoxiously loud exhaust noises, but it was nice nonetheless.   I had the porcini linguine which was pretty good! The porcini taste itself is very mild, but it's definitely present. The spoonful of breadcrumbs was the perfect touch because if offers just the right counter-texture to the soft mushrooms and al dente pasta.   The pasta was cooked a little too al dente, but it was still good. The mushrooms were softer than the pasta (which is to be expected), but the pasta could have used another 30 seconds to a minute in water.  The sauce is very infused with mushrooms and a little bit of garlic/shallots. The sauce was very \"minimalist\" - there wasn't very much to it.   I was kind of disappointed there was no crustini of focaccia bread to finish up the rest (often a staple in Italian food), but the food was excellent otherwise!  We ordered the pizza as well (zucchini) and the crust was super thin! If they had out any more toppings to it, it wouldn't have held it's own, and the toppings were sparse at best.  Server was new (was obvious) but she tried her best. I really enjoyed my experience, the quantity was on the small side, but is awesome.   Comparing this I Scaddabush, I would go to Scaddavush over this just for the quantity of food (same price, approximately), but the dining experience and presentation itself is better here.   Overall, pretty good for a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"We arrived at this location on a weekend back in July and it was around 4:40 pm when we arrived. We asked to be seated at the patio and we were seated immediately. So far so good. We were handed our menus and the server walked away.  I noticed that they had a drink special up until 5 PM for a lower price then the regular. Since we still had 15 minutes before the special was up we thought we would get it. We waited and waited for our server to take our drink orders and she didn't come back until 5:02 PM. We asked if we could get the special and she said its past 5 so the discount doesn't apply anymore. And I said well we got here before 5 and waited for someone to take our drink orders and waited for 15 minutes. The server just gave an apology but still said she couldn't do anything about it. At this point we were pretty pissed. The only thing that got us not to get up and leave was that I was very hungry so had to stick around to grab food. Since we waited for so long we gave our drink and food order at the same time. Didn't want to wait separately for both because we could tell the service was going to be slow. One of the things we ordered was the crab and avocado bruschetta. It had no flavour and I couldn't even taste the avocado. Also ordered the Jamie Italian burger. The burger was excellent but due to their service i will NOT be coming back to the Mississauga location."}
{"text":"Our first visit was to the Yorkdale location and we had a nice meal with generous portions.  Based on our positive first experience, we visited Jamie's Italian at Square One with our family.  The experience between the locations could not have been more different.  Appetizers came out with so small of portions that we had to order multiple more to feed our family of four.  We ordered more because the appetizers tasted good, just give more food in the orders!  I convinced my Mother-in-law to order the Crab Spaghetti which was totally different from what I had experienced in that it literally had very little crab in it.  We complained and their attempt to rectify was to bring a portion of crab which was little shreds like you would get from a cheap can of crab, verity disappointing.  My Chicken Cacciatore was a burnt breast of chicken topped with a sauce that could have been good if the charred taste of the chicken did not ruin it.  Impression is that they re-grilled a piece of roasted chicken and burnt it trying to heat it up.  Looking around the restaurant it we could overhear that other people were having similar issues with portion sizes and quality versus the prices.  Great concept, poor execution.  Would give them another chance if they address the issues cause you gotta love Jamie Oliver."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special. Not bad , not good. Service was good and restaurant looks cool but that was it. My salad was dry and my clients burger was $15 dollars for just a mediocre burger. No sides!  My biggest issue was that the girl who handles all the food after coming from the cook and wipes the edges clean before the waiters bring them to the table was sick. She was sneezing and coughing. The manager went and talked to her and asked how she was doing and yet she continued working handling the plates. Worse yet SHE brought our plates over. Common, restaurant 101  no? If you're sick don't handle my food."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the food. I initially wanted to order the fresh crab spaghetti. Unfortunately, it wasn't available. The server therefore recommended the prawn spaghetti to me. That dish was claimed to be very popular internationally. It was surprisingly good. I am usually not a big fan of prawns. It has made an exception this time.  My friend ordered pork chop. He was also very impressed because it wasn't dry as he anticipated. The service was fairly awesome. I had a great time there."}
{"text":"This is the worst food we ever had in a big brand restaurant. It's bland, insipid, stale and terribly cooked --nothing Italian. It costs phenomenal for the substandard quality and portion size, and in return you get rubbish to eat. It's robbery. Staff are good so two stars for them; they apologized for the chef's lack of knowledge, and failure to stick to Jamie Oliver's name when pointed out how horrible the food is --the stale cold tomato sauces used on pizza, half cooked chicken and porks kept in fridge for reuse, soggy old salad leaves, polenta chips so soaking in fried-refried smelly oil that you wouldn't want to put it in mouth (or if you press the chips with fork, chances you will spray oil in your eyes), the Turkey Milanese so bad and nothing to match with menu description as \"truffle\", cream and whatnots; no dips, no side tastiness with thick layer of bread crumbs --so very thick that you feel you're only having unevenly fried soggy bread crumbs --you wonder where's Turkey because there isn't any in all likelihood. I think the only stuff we liked was freshly made hot potato chips of all shapes and size --funky, spiced etc. But for that I would go to any Burger King, or McDonald. Right? They all taste more or less same everywhere. And if served hot --dip in tomato-mustard sauce and with cold beer it tastes fantastic. Don't tell me Jamie Oliver only makes best finger fries. The restaurant is coming with a new menu soon. But will we go again to waste our hard earned money ($190 for three people for a moderate portion meal). Nope. Not likely."}
{"text":"Portions are on the smaller end, highly recommend the meat as it's all free range and wonderfully cooked.  Came here at the start of a long weekend and we had no problem getting a table for two - they have a ton of seating inside and a small patio outside for ~25 people. The inside is very loud and busy so the patio is nice as it's quieter, however it's not a great patio as it's literally just a couple tables on the sidewalk overlooking the parking lot. Needs some greenery and umbrellas! Servers are very attentive, though I can tell they're new to the industry as they aren't too assertive or confident. But they get the job done!  We had the Pimm's Cup, Bellini and Hurricane for drinks - loved the Hurricane, though some may find it sour. Don't be like the lady beside us who complained about it being sour after the meal was done. That's not a good look.  For apps we had the pork & fennel meatballs, the plank for one and the Arancini (risotto balls). Risotto balls didn't have as much flavour as I expected, and the plank really was just for one person - it was tiny! About 5 thin slices of salami/prosciutto, a piece of cheese on a sliver of pita bread and a small piece of buffalo mozzarella. Not the best charcuterie board I've had, nothing amazing or adventurous. The meatballs were the best app by far, wonderful seasoning and tenderness. I think meat is their strong suit here. For our mains we ordered the prosciutto and melon salad - came with buffalo mozzarella and pesto, overall meh as I thought the flavour combination would be better than it was. I definitely don't think it was worth $17 but I'm glad I tried it. My partner ordered the porkchop with seasonal vegetable and again, was blown away by how well they do their meats. Best porkchop I've tried - not dry at all, was complemented nicely by the jams/jellies/sauces on the plate and grilled vegetables. Makes me tempted to try their steak, even though it's an Italian resto! For dessert we had the tiramisu with orange zest and lemon meringue cheesecake. Not your typical tiramisu as it's layered. The cheesecake is a sight to see, and big enough for two people.  Overall - good meal. Will definitely come back to try their pasta, pizzas and more of their meats. Scaddabush is going to lose a lot of business to these guys."}
{"text":"I went to Jamie's Italian for a friends birthday this evening. There were six of us and not one good meal was had between us. We ordered the gnocchi, prawn linguine, porcini fettuccine, meatball pizza, burger with polenta fries and the bolognese. For appetizers we had the squid, garlic bread and Arancini Margherita. All of the food was very bland. The gnocchi was such a small portion, the pizza toppings were sparse and bland. The burger was salty and so were the polenta fries which were also too crispy. The fettuccine did not have enough sauce, there was very little prawn in the linguine and it was bland as was the bolognese.  Two cocktails were also ordered, the very berry and the mojito, both average.  We were all so surprised at how bad this place is....wondering if Jamie is aware fully??? It's not a place I would ever recommend to anyone not even for a drink. We didn't want to even bother with dessert that's how disappointing it was.  My one star is for the servers and staff they were all courteous and well presented.  We were initially looking forward to trying this restaurant as Jamie is one of our favourite chefs to watch but it was all very tasteless.  I hope the can adjust their menu or something but we all regretted going there and wished we had gone to Moxies or anywhere else actually.  Overall it was lacklustre and as much as we love Jamie, his restaurant doesn't reflect him well at all."}
{"text":"This place was really cool it had a nice of vibe and a rustic and Industrial feel our server Maria spent too long describing the specials there is no change table in the men's washroom however there is one in the accessible washroom the specials seems to be about $5 more than anything on the menu we showed up at 11:30 which was pretty good because it filled up quickly around 12 the staff were pretty good and professional I would go again"}
{"text":"We decided to come here because we thought Jamie Oliver would be associated with a good quality restaurant, but boy were we wrong.  No one liked any of the dishes we ordered. Considering every dish cost about 15-20, it was quite a disappointment.  The chicken lollipop kids meal was dry and flavorless. The linguini was undercooked and hard. The zucchini pizza was soggy.  If the service was good, I can understand a bad day in the kitchen, but service was non existent. We saw our waiter when we ordered and never again. We didn't get cheese for our linguini at all. No top up on water. We asked for our bill twice and it still took 5 mins to get.  Not sure if all Jamie Oliver restaurants are like this, but you can bet I'm never taking that chance again."}
{"text":"Crab pasta was way too salty and buttery. I think more of the anchovies oil was poured into the sauce than the anchovies itself. Barely any crab either. And using phones to enter your order does not look professional. When we ordered I thought the waiter was texting. At least change the otterbox into a case that says jamies or even a 6\" tablet."}
{"text":"Food, cocktails, and service is absolute garbage here. We ordered a slice of cheesecake which was served on a wooden plank and placed on 2 tomato jars...seriously?!?! 2 tomato jars?! Is Jamie Oliver maintaining a quality control standard on his restaurants??!! Or did some morons decide to run a restaurant chain and slap his name on it to bring in the masses? No wonder Gordon Ramsay shits on him. This  was one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever encountered and we will definitely not be returning. I would avoid this restaurant at all costs...especially if you are celebrating an event!"}
{"text":"I visited opening weekend. Service was mediocre. My waitress seemed \"out of it\". Not attentive, not friendly, she did not recommend anything. She read me the special directly off the chalkboard as if I couldn't read it right in front of me.  But I get it.... they just opened. Due to everyones Yelp Raves about the Turkey Milanese ($22) which is apparently HUGE, I ordered it and was disappointed. Meat was dry, portion was tiny and seemed to be half the size of other diners who ordered same dish. Pizza was over cooked leading to a nearly burnt crust and crispiness that was unedible. Star of the night was the Prawn Linguine but even that was medicore. 3/5 stars. This place is just another mall restaurant chain. I would have expected more from Jamie Oliver."}
{"text":"When you need a break from shopping, Jamie's Italian is the perfect spot to have a seated meal.   It's less loud here than Bier Market. I like the menu more than Earl's and it is family friendly!   All the items that we ordered were good and the service here was excellent!   The meatball bruschetta was a great saucy starter.   The chicken puntenesca is a large serving and the chicken was perfectly cooked.   As for the desert, the brownie with caramel popcorn and gelato was delicious!   This is my new dinner spot when I am at Square One! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is truly mediocre and the service is just average for a place like this.   We ordered nachos that turned out to be this awful tasteless ravioli that really punished my stomach. The sausage pasta tasted like bricks and salty tomato sauce. In contrast the only thing good here was the calmari.   Will bring my girlfriend here when I decide to break up with her."}
{"text":"Jamie's is perfect for a little break in between shopping as its located in the newly renovated section of Square One. Boy that mall has changed from my teenage years! For the better though :).  Jamie's is definitely hot & new. I love the d√©cor they have going on, its fresh and welcoming but homey too. The service is pretty good as well, you can really tell they are trying to achieve that downtown classy feeling of a restaurant.  For our food, my table ordered:  Porcini Fettucine Porkchop  Gnocchi Ravioli Spicy Fries Calamari (I think its call something else)  All of our dishes had great flavours, with the exception of the Calamari, which I found a little underseasoned for my taste. Definitely had to squeeze some salt on that.  Portion wise however, I think they need to improve a tiny bit on that, especially for the prices that are being charged. My husband ordered the Gnocchi, and gobbled it up in less than 5 minutes (and he is a slow eater). He left the restaurant definitely feeling hungry and wanting more. But at $18.00 a dish for a vegetarian dish, you're not exactly jumping to order.   Every other dish portion wise/taste was GREAT. Just be careful with the gnocchi as its definitely not enough to feed one.  :)"}
{"text":"The service was great but the mushroom pizza wasn't the best because all you tasted were the mushrooms and the bolognese spaghetti was very bland and the tomato sauce was as vibrant as it should be and the meatball spaghetti was also bland but the tomato sauce was very vibrant and the meatballs didn't look like meat but another animal but they were still very delicious and the mushroom fettuccine wasn't bland but didn't look as appetizing as it should from a very well known chef on TV"}
{"text":"We came at 2pm to the restaurant it was quite empty but clean and cozy .Extrem nice waiter took really good care of us. Service was very fast too.Food was good too I had the prawn linguine and pizza was tasty too. The pizza was very good so far the closest to the real Italian pizza. I was really impressed. I will definitely go to the restaurant again if iam craving pizza.Would recommend this place for dates and friends get together."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and each visit became worse than the last.   The first time I came, it was only open for about 1 month so the hype was still there and I'm sure that's when they really tried (\"they\" as in the cooks and waiters/waitresses)!   The food was actually very good when I first came (pricey but good) and because of that, I wanted to come back! I kind of made a big deal out of it....it is Jamie Oliver of course! And for all you foodies out there, you would know how amazing of a chef he is!   The second time I came, food was okay, and at that point I looked like (1) I had bad taste in food or (2) I'm a liar. And nobody wants that!   The third time I came, I didn't really have a choice. It was for my father-in-law's birthday. He was craving Italian and had been wanting to try this restaurant. And as a new daughter-in-law, I wasn't about to tell him not to go where he wanted to on his birthday! Their soup of the day was bland and only lukewarm, one of their pasta dishes were too salty, overpriced menu and not enough food! Not very \"authentic\" and didn't satisfy the Italian craving at all.  I'd say the service has been pretty consistent, in a good way...they're very attentive, helpful, knows the menu well and very friendly!   Would I come back? Probably not Would it be bad to say I'd rather go to east side marios? ....because I would."}
{"text":"Was treated to a pre birthday meal by a friend here, the night before my birthday. Firstly, I was surprised by the level of service that I received entering this restaurant. The servers all welcomed me, and when I told them my friend was already inside waiting, they then addressed me by name and brought me to where she was sitting. We started off with an appetizer - I have forgotten its name, but it was basically fried risotto balls with mozza cheese inside and tomato based sauce with chili peppers. Very nice, but the sauce was needed to give it its flavourful kick. It was therefore very disappointing when the server took the plate full of sauce away, when my friend and I still had the balls left on our plates. I'm not a fan of fried foods nor cheese, but I found this acceptable and fairly tasty. I then ordered the crab spaghetti while my friend got their gnocchi. The crab spaghetti had only a few pieces of crab, and the house-made spaghetti was very chewy and sticky. The broth was very good, and I loved the fennels and scallions! It was nowhere as salty as the reviews for the Yorkdale location claimed. The gnocchi was also very good - extremely chewy! I am a big fan of pesto, and so loved the base. The potato slices tasted like kettle chips, and even like Lays! We then ended off with the sorbet dessert, which consisted of strawberry, lemon, and mango. I made the mistake of eating strawberry before mango - as the strawberry is so sweet, I immediately found the mango to be bitter. The mango had a very rich taste of coconut. The lemon was both tart and bitter. Overall, a pricey but satisfying meal! Maybe a bit too expensive for what it is truly worth, but I did enjoy this dinner very much."}
{"text":"Both staff and atmosphere is fantastic.  They have a patio area but the patio is nothing great since it faces nothing, but the interior is decorated very nicely.  The bar area faces the mall and has a great vibe.  They've only been in business only a few days and everyone couldn't be more friendly and happy.  They're eager to explain their menu and very enthusiastic about their specials.  I hope this stays that way!  Tried their artisan pizza and pasta -  I do think their pasta has less flavour than I'd like, but I'm a big fan of the pasta texture.  The pasta was a bit bland and I did have to add a decent amount of salt.I find that their menu is quite limiting (not a lot of  choices) and i find myself going over the menu a few times in hopes that something will catch my eye.    Again, this place is quite new and so far not very crowded.  I enjoy the environment where it's just enough people to feel lively but quiet enough for a conversation.  This may change as the restaurant gets filled with people later on."}
{"text":"great location, great look. Servers could be better trained (had to ask for a second round of drinks...how often does that happen?). Food was interesting but a little bland. Tried several appetizers, vegetable plank, crispy squid, olives on ice...good not great. Also tried the fungi misto pizza and the spicy meatball pizza. Pizza was excellent, meatballs were not really spicy, but the sauce was terrific. Biggest disappointment was the \"crispy music bread\". Great story but v v v v bland taste."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with some friends. 2 couples for a total of 4 people. We ordered 3 drinks and the mojito was definitely the best out of all 4. We ordered 2 apps, the meatballs and the tomato and ricotta bruschetta,... you should have honestly seen the reaction on our faces when the appetizers were brought to the table...  3 meats balls and one piece of bruschetta, obviously we were expecting alot more, alot more. .... For the main course we order 2 spinich and ricotta ravioli's ( they were so bland and tasteless that we had to get some hot sauce to make it some what edible), the jamie's Italian burger ( decent, but honestly, if you screw up a burger how bad can it be), And the Italian steak and fries (nothing to wrote home about). We ordered 4 desserts ( 2 epic brownies which were decent, cheesecake was ok and the tiramisu wasn't good at all).In total our bill came to $205 for 4 people. I have no hesitation spending that much on a dinner but it has to be worth it, and this definitely wasn't.... It's sad that we were jokingly debating on going to a burger king to grab some food.. Sorry, i would not recommend this to any friends looking for a good meal at a reasonable value..."}
{"text":"Food has gotten so much better since this franchise first came to Canada. They've changed practically all their pastas and meat dishes. The classic meat plank was a hit! Don't be fooled into paying per person. Just getting one serving of it is enough for 2 people to share as an app. Such great selections on this plank!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, I'm from Vancouver and just visiting Mississauga. First of all took forever to be seated and once we were seated we had no idea who our server was. Someone didn't come to help us for a very long time and finally when we ordered, Our food took awhile to come and the pasta I got was super salty. Afterwards I asked for a spoon from a server never got that spoon. I'm honestly shocked at how bad the costumer service was and feel awful for Jamie Oliver's name to plastered all over this restaurant gives him a bad name. Not to  mention we didn't get our bill so I walked up to the hostess because it was taking way too long. Finally when we got the bill it was all wrong so she went to go fix it and still got it wrong, finally the third time it was right. Honestly felt so bad for the bartender working she seemed super stressed not only did she had to make drinks and also deal with our bill, very poorly staffed. I've never ever at a restaurant seen the bartender have to deal with the costumers sitting in the lounge eating as well. Wish I had spoken to the manager but unfortunately I was so frustrated I didn't want to stay a minute longer in there."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Jamie's Italian. I've heard mixed reviews (more bad than good unfortunately) reviews at the Yorkdale location, so I decided to try out the Square One location. It was a Friday night, very busy obviously. We had a choice of waiting 20-30 mins or sitting at the bar right away. We were starving so we chose to sit at the bar.   I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara because parmigiano carbonara sounded so so good, and I wanted to enjoy something cheesy. Both our pasta dishes came out within 15-20 minutes. We were very impressed because it was quite busy at the restaurant!! Thought we would have to wait longer.    The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and the cream sauce was actually light and cheesy! I was expected sorta a heavy sauce dish, but was very surprised to see that the pasta was tossed in the sauce instead of being drowned in it. I also loved the crispy panchetta, it added a wonderful robust flavour to the dish. So scrumptious, I know this is already my favourite pasta dish.   The FHubs ordered the Porcini Fettucine. It has wild and field mushrooms, mascarpone, garlic, white wine, gremolata, parmigiano, and pangrattato. It has a wonderful mushroomy aroma. The flavour wasn't as robust as my spaghetti carbonara, but was definitely tasty.  It was a light herby and garlicky flavour, with a hint of citrus. The white wine sauce was light and wasn't heavy. The fettuccine was also cooked perfectly al dente. He really enjoyed this dish!   Next time I would love to try out their handmade pizzas!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit torn about the rating I wanted to give JISO (Jamie's Italian Square One), but after going back and forth I feel like A-OK best describes the experience. Nothing was mind-blowingly great, nothing was awful. A decent dining experience that when in the area I'd come back again for.  I was having a Mother-Son mall day and we had been schlepping around Sq1 for several hours and we were getting tired, hungry and a little cranky. I'd been wanting to try Jamie's Italian for quite some time since they opened at Yorkdale and then more recently Sq1, so we walked in and grabbed a table.  We were greeted by the server and she ran through the specials and provided some solid recommendations for lunch options. My mom, looking to be healthy, went for the mixed grain salad (Super Food) and I, not so healthy, went for the Burger with a side of their garlic and parmesan chips (fries).  I was a little surprised that there was no, complimentary... anything, while we waited, especially for a restaurant chain as well known as Jamie Oliver. I felt like this was a miss, some bread or pickled veggies (something) would have gone a long way I feel.   The restaurant wasn't very busy but I couldn't understand why our meals took so long to come out, neither were overly difficult, and didn't require excessive cooking, yet we waited over 25 minutes for 2 mains and no appetisers to appear.  Food then arrived and the superfood salad was very healthy. If you're dining vegan, Gluten free or paleo, this is definitely a solid option. If you're looking for a kick of protein I would recommend adding either a filet of salmon or chicken breast. Definitely a healthy choice menu item but hard to eat when someone at the table it killing a burger and fries.  My burger was impressive at first glance, nice bun, good size - especially for the price, and well dressed. Where it fell short was the pattie. Over cooked and crusted on the outside, dry on the inside, I would have sent it back but I was too hungry to wait any longer. Aside from the overcooked meat the burger checked out and was pretty good - definitely has potential.  The star of the meal was the chips (fries). Cooked to piping hot and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and doused on truffle oil, cooked garlic and freshly grated parmesan cheese. I'd give these 10 stars if I could, a must have!  I'd like to return to Jamie's and try some other signature items reassess this place in a few weeks time. Don't write them off as they're definitely worth a try.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some girl friends on a weekday and ordered off of their Super Lunch menu. This is my second time at Jamie's Italian and my first experience was pretty pleasant so I decided to bring a different group of friends to this place. I ordered the beef carpaccio, tagliatelle bolognese, and the epic brownie.  To start off, there was some old food encrusted on my utensils. It was quite a big chunk and having them replaced was not a problem. The beef carpaccio was mediocre and definitely could have used more of that balsamic glaze they drizzled on top. The tagliatelle looked like they had skimped on the bolognese sauce. The noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente, but the lack of sauce ruined this dish. When I felt like I couldn't chew on these dry noodles anymore, I asked if I could have extra sauce and our server gladly brought us some more. The sauce could have also used more seasoning. Finally, dessert - brownie was nothing special, tasted like the stuff you can get at grocery stores. This was also another dish that lacked in sauce (fudge sauce this time). Asked for more fudge drizzle, and our server was more than happy take our brownies back to the kitchen for more drizzling. I didn't really appreciate the popcorn in this dessert - it definitely could have used more vanilla bean gelato though to balance out the richness of the brownie.  The only redeeming this about this place was the service we had that day. Our server was polite and professional and our waters were filled regularly. I don't think I'll be coming back or bring friends here again."}
{"text":"There is only one word to describe my experience here. Mortifying! We came inside, wondering why there was no one sitting down to eat. Unfortunately, not long after, we got an answer. When the steak arrived before the vegetable dish and pasta dish, we knew it would only go downhill from there. And it did. The steak was stone cold and the cheese felt and tasted like fat. One of the members at our table is allergic to tree nuts, so she explained that to the waitress. When the pasta arrived, there were tree nuts sprinkled on top and in the pasta sauce. As she was waiting to get a new dish, they told her it would be 3 minutes. Ten minutes later, the dish arrived. However we waited the span of our whole meal, waiting for our garlic bread to come. Eventually we asked the waitress when it was coming and she tried to play it off as if we did not order it. The warmest thing we got was the garlic bread that barely had any garlic taste to it. They said they would remove her pasta from the bill, but instead they removed the price of the vegetables, which were the cheapest thing we ordered. If I could, I would give it no stars, but that is not an option. If you want to spend your money on horrid food than go ahead but I do not suggest it. Not impressed. I should have gone to The Three Brewers."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We were seated and had to go back to the hostess after 30mins of no one serving us (no water, no menus, we just sat there). Manager came out to apologize but was very condescending. Food was cold and then after all of that, the manager spoke to us about the lack of tip. It was unbelievable. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Came here hungry. Left angry and unsatisfied.  I have been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time ever since it opened a while ago. After all, it is helmed by a very well-known international celebrity chef inside one of Canada's greatest shopping malls: Square One Shopping Centre.  There are regular and high tables lined up along the railing of the restaurant looking in. After you walk past the wall, is a very large, open-concept dining area. You will be very impressed with the industrial d√©cor of red and silver stainless steel lamps and exhaust ventilation that discreetly covers the high ceilings.  The long rows of banquette style seating make for enough patrons to dine with or without reservations. Walk around and watch staff working hard to prep appetizers and main courses on either side of restaurant is always great entertainment.  The Service It wasn't very busy at all so I would have expected our dining experience to move along quickly. My wife and I were seated next to a wall at a very small table for two so I'm assuming the servers thought that we didn't need to be served. It took 1.5 hrs from the time were seated to the time it took to pay our bill. And all we had was a pizza and pasta to share.  The Food Margherita Pizza ($14.95) Greasy. Can you see the shine and glossiness in my photo? When you lift up a slice, it goes limp. Probably the grease is weighing it down. Famous Prawn Linguine ($20.95) Bland pasta. Even when we tried to add parmesan for more flavour to the small batch, it was beyond repair. Two prawns to share for $20.95. That was it. Two prawns. My battery died at this point. Sorry folks no more photos.  Stuck with the bill: Over $40.00 No wonder Gordon Ramsay thinks Jamie's cooking is a joke.

{"text":"Came here on a Saturday late afternoon after a couple hours of roaming Square 1.  Walked in at 5pm and was told the dining room was full.  We were seated at the high tops near the bar.   The hostess showed us to the table with menus in hand.  Within a minute we had decided our wine, app and mains.  About 10 minutes passed before anyone came to our table to take our order.  Our water glasses remained upside down and empty this entire time until 5 minutes later when the wine was brought to the table I had to ask the server for some cold water.  We ordered:  1 glass of rising 1 glass of sauv blanc Truffle chips/fries Porchetta  Crab Spaghetti   Truffle fries were unseasoned and boring, the server zoomed by as if he was sitting shotgun and asked how the fries were. I responded with a \"mehhh,  they're OK...\" and he just left. I was going to ask for salt after my response but he already removed himself from the conversation.   I placed the Truffle fry bowl to the side for it to get taken away. Server came and I asked to \"pick up\" the mains, Truffle bowl remained on the table.  It took about 15 minutes for the kitchen to pick up on a spaghetti and a precooked Porchetta dish.   As the food arrived the food runner just left and we had to ask for a spoon,  fresh ground pepper and parm cheese.  Porchetta slice was less than 1cm thick, dry, unseasoned and boring.  Crab pasta was tasty but lacked actual pieces of crab, more like crab mush here and there.  our server has not been seen since before the mains arrived and the empty Truffle bowl still remains on the table after 45 minutes..."}
{"text":"I love everything about Jamie Oliver so i was excited to try his restaurant. I had the bolognese which is usually my go to when Im undecisive. I was so excited when my dish arrived , it looked good , very nice presentation even have a great aroma to it. The taste was blah. I was so disappointed I had to add salt, pepper and chili flakes to my meal.Im not sure if the chefs were super busy and forgot to season my main dish but it was very lackluster. The cheesecake was awesome loved the pomegrante seeds. I am definitely wiling to give this  brand another try but at a different location, maybe 2nd time will be the charm."}
{"text":"very underwhelmed.  expected the price points, but the flavours weren't there to back it up.  also we had a special request so the hostesses called in the manager to discuss with us.  noticed that this manager kept shaking his head and rolling his eyes after talking with us as well as when he was taking us to our seats. like another poster mentioned i'd rather go to moxies."}
{"text":"I had such big expectations for this place! I have been wanting to go since it opened and I'm SOOOOOOOO disappointed.   service is good & it's clean, average price blah blah   But the food was so ughhh. nothing special at all to be honest I didn't even like my food ....   I got the carpaccio to start & my boyfriend got a soup. and for our mains I got the chicken club and my boyfriend got the Fettuccine bolognaise.   it was so brutal. Neither of us finished our meal.   The pasta had these super crispy breadcrumbs which tasted like seeds or something. Not a fan And my Sandwich had the weirdest taste ever   I'll never go back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.. there is not much to say.. service is below average..Appetizers: fried mushrooms are OK.. tapenade is vaguely related to actual tapenade (lacking in taste) and the fried calamari is bland and undercooked! The porcini pizza was a joke, trying to be artisanal but not even acting up to it.. the mushroom fettuccine was lacking in salt and flavor and the sauce is almost non existent (charged us 2 dollars for extra two spoons of sauce, what a joke).. the portions are small for the price you are paying!  Our waiter never asked how the food was! I do not recommend this place and will not visit again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Jamie Oliver, so when I heard about this restaurant I was very excited to try it. However, I was deeply disappointed. The restaurant is no better than any other Italian place around the corner.  First they don't take reservations after 5 pm from Thursday to Saturday, so please don't go with a party of 10 or over since you will probably have to wait for at least an hour like my party of 15 had to. We called the restaurant ahead of time to confirm if they could seat a party of 15 on a Saturday at 7 pm. On the phone, they said yes but forgot to mention the fact that we would have to sit on 3 different tables. Now that's just ridiculous! Why would I want to come with a party of 15 and sit on 3 different tables. They should have made that clear on the phone so then I would have gone somewhere else. Second, the food lacked flavour. Please don't order the Bruschetta. It's a tiny piece of bread for $10, and the bread was hard to bite in. The pastas lacked flavour and the portions were a good size. The service was good. Also 18% tip is automatically charged for party of 10 or over. So just be aware of that.  Overall, I will not go to the restaurant again because the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Had a great night with my friends last night!    Jamie's Italian is a nice modern/hipster restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  Customer service was great, our server was attentive throughout.  The food was okay for me...I had the gennaros famous porchetta and the pork belly was tender with the crispy skin on the top!  I just feel it needed more flavour or a different type of sauce to go with the pork to give it that kick in flavour.  The cheesecake I got was delicious and smooth.    I would probably try out this place again and try something else on the menu.  Overall, I enjoyed my night."}
{"text":"For being Jamie Oliver's restaurant, I was expecting more bite to the food.    The Square One location of Jamie's Italian is absolutely beautiful. The decor is very pretty and the presentation of the food is just as beautiful. Unfortunately the taste of the food is not entirely on point. I ordered the porchetta (One of my favs). The plate was wonderfully presented. It look so pretty I didn't want to get the utensils in though it was pretty bland once I did eat it.  It didn't have much flavour to it at all. I've taste some very good porchetta but this plate was way too simple in taste. It was pretty much just a fatty steak with pear sauce beneath it and some veggies for decoration.  It was cold as well.  Our waiter tended to us twice and that was it. After it was four different waiters tending to us. The place wasn't packed to have four waiters tending to us. We would have enjoyed more the company of only one waiter. We felt rushed as well.   Service was just as crappy as the food. Unfortunately in the food industry you can't get away with just a pretty plate.  $90 for two mains, two plates of bread and water. Overpriced crappy meal. This place is just a name."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Jamie Oliver I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant out. I love his TV shows. I had high expectations for this place. Sadly it was a disappointing experience. I also finally got around to writing this review.   Food: 1/5 Presentation was lovely, and the food looked mouth watering. Sadly most of the dishes lacked flavour  We got the buratta to start. While the texture was soft one gooey the whole thing lacked flavour and salt. I can't help comparing this to Scaddabush burratas, which I love. This just didn't compare.  Not sure what was going on with the pasta dishes. Most of the pasta dishes were either salty or under salted. I got the Gnocchi Genovese, which tasted ok, and the texture of the gnocchi was light and fluffy. Overall this was an okay dish, but not one of the best that I've had.   The Prawn Linguine was way too salty and we sent it back to the kitchen. The chefs were prompt in redoing it. In the second attempt, the prawns were nicely cooked, but overall the dish lacked flavour.   My sister ordered the Procini Fettuccine, which also was so salty we had to get them to redo this dish as well.   My mom enjoyed her sweet potato salad special. It looked lovely and had a nice mix of sweet potato, fig, and greens. It had the right balance of texture and everything worked well together in the dish.  For drinks I ordered the Refresher, it sounded interesting and I love elderflower. But it was way too sweet and I didn't even finish it.   4/5 Servers were friendly and kitchen was prompt in redoing the orders. The server did come up and check on us to make sure that everything was okay through out the meal, and quick to act when we said the dishes were salty.  Decor 5/5 The decor was nice and I liked the wooden decor elements. It looked modern and  hip. The chairs were comfy. It was cool that you could see the salad bar and the chefs working behind that.  Sadly I won't be back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for ages since Italian is one of my fave foods. Right from the start, the ambiance is just right. The kitchen is open so you can see the cooks working which is a nice touch because you never see the back of the house staff. I was going to try the pizza, but I decided last minute for pasta, the spicy sausage cassarecce. The pasta was too hard for my taste (even though I love al dente), the rapini was cooked perfectly, the pork was spicy, but I would have loved it if was spicer. We tried the calamari as well, but I wasn't a big fan. It was such a little portion that you couldn't really share it. I also find the prices to be expensive but I realized that all the food and produce is organic and locally sourced. Maybe I'll come back and try some of their pizza, which was my first choice, but from first impressions, I wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Second time at Jamie's Italian and I'm underwhelmed. Ingredients are used sparingly and service was lacking. Our waiter didn't come around much and when my pizza came out I asked for fresh parmesan but had to wait ten minutes and had to ask another staff member to get it for me. Didnt live up to my expectations for a Jamie Oliver restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Jamie's Italian for a while having dined there a handful of times since they opened about 6-8 times a year.  My last visit was terrible and I will not be returning.  I arrived 5 mins prior to my reservation and checked in with a hostess I was told to go to the bar with my 7yr old and wait a few mins while they got my table ready.  Not really a big deal, however, I was forgotten there for about 10 mins while they began to take walk-ins ahead of me.  I addressed this issue with one of the hostesses working the front check in area and she was resolving it, when from out of nowhere storms over the \"Assistant General Manager, Alicia(sp?) who was extremely rude and condescending towards me.  She did not ask me what if any issue was going on only proceeded to inquire with her staff who told her they were seating my party, instead she spoke to me in a rude manner as if I was abusing the hostess and causing a scene, she was exclaiming, \" I resolved the situation\", \" I handled it well\"?!? I was just standing there in disbelief, explaining to her that it wasn't necessary for her to intervene and I wasn't sure what she was told about why I was waiting and that her staff had forgotten about me?  It was literally one of the most rude and incompetent displays of service I've ever experienced.  Her behavior was the exact opposite of what their website claims to be warm and welcoming.  Needless to say I will never spend a dime in their restaurants again.  Thankfully I've had the opportunity to continue to share my experience with friends and colleagues and saved them from this type of disastrous service."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Jamie Oliver so when I found out he opened up a restaurant in Square One; I just had to check it out. Love the d√©cor and the ambiance of this place. It's very rustic, yet contemporary, with a homely feel to it.   The service and the food were great! I ordered the Porcini Fettucine, Epic Brownie and Jamie's Mojito.  Porcini Fettucine - very delicious. It had lots of mushrooms and the sauce was very creamy. The breadcrumbs gave it a very good texture. I will say it did need a *tiny* bit of salt and pepper but nonetheless it was great. I would order it again.   Epic Brownie - it was okay. The brownie itself was very 'fudgy'. Wishing it had a bigger scoop of gelato to balance out the heaviness of the brownie. I thought the caramelized popcorn was really random. It didn't add to the dessert at all. The popcorn either froze in the ice cream or soggy from the chocolate sauce, which was really awkward to eat. The vanilla bean gelato definitely saved this dish - it was the best part!  Jamie's Mojito - this was VERY strong. I couldn't taste the freshness of the mint, lime or sugar. It was just rum and ice. Now for some people this wouldn't be a problem, but I ordered a mojito not a shot."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  My husband and I ordered the burger and prawn linguine.  It was good. Although the portion could have been bit bigger.  My sons spaghetti and meatballs off the kids menu was bland.  There was no taste to it."}
{"text":"As most people have stated, this restaurant is quite disappointing. We expected a little more since it is named Jamie Oliver.. anyways. We came in on a Monday night it was quite quiet, we were seated right away. There's two stars - one for the server, she was nice and had great service. The other star is for the calamari. We ordered the calamari, it was about $12-13, the disappointing thing was how small the portion is! Me and two others shared and we legit had 2-3 pieces of calamari each... we also ordered a main, everyone ordered something different, I got the ruchine (?) fettuccine pasta. At first it was good but the food got very boring very soon. I couldn't even finish it. My other two friends agreed. We had half our dish and couldn't continue eating it. The restaurant itself has a nice vibe, but with the food / portion size delivered..  don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Service is slow and not the best.  Food is ok. Nothing great.  Don't think will be returning."}
{"text":"I can understand why the overall rating here is struggling. When you have a celebrity restaurant (especially someone so down to earth as Jamie Oliver), people expect the world! I did too.   D√©cor: Tries a little too hard to be \"Barn-door chic\"- it's not just accents. It's everything!!!  Drinks: Got the house wine. Totally fine for the price. Not dry...very drinkable in general.   Food: I got the Margarita pizza. After doing a low-carb thing for 1.5 weeks, I wanted to devour a freshly made pizza. But I was heartbroken. The sauce was lacking flavor/seasoning. The cheese was sparse. And the crust lacked flavor. I really wanted to love it, but I feel like this was poor even for a generic Italian restaurant.  Also, I was surprise to find out they didn't have a charcuterie board. Isn't that an Italian restaurant staple? Seemed like they had a lot of options for different dietary needs, which is nice. But the overall I did not love the food. Oh but the spicy fries were great!!!  Couple of my friends had the famous shrimp linguine. It was good, and simple. Nothing to die for. I feel like 3 stars is fair here... Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Being at the Yorkdale location, this one is no different. I love the wooden cozy decor, and high ceilings even for a smaller space. the first time I went there, food was amazing. Since it's been around for a bit, things have plateau'd a little bit.   Food I like here. My favourite is the Porcini Mushroom pasta, and I had the option of getting it with gluten free pasta. Although, it came to me dry, I remember it being a little more saucier. I also recommend the deep fried mushrooms. try also a fancy juice and you don't be disappointed.  there is an entrance within the mall, as well as outside."}
{"text":"After dining at Jamie's Union Jacks at Covent Garden, London our expectations were similar from Jamie's Italian. The place offers a super ambience with awesome customer service. The food was also good, which we expected it to be excellent. I liked the porcini fettuccine. Spaghetti Carbonara was like any other home made dish. However please try to orange blossom polenta cake which was outstanding. I'd definitely go back to Jamie's Italian to try some of their other dishes. Cheers"}
{"text":"The Square One location opened just 3 days ago and I have somehow already managed to visit it for the 3rd time. It may be due to the abundance of management and trainers for the opening, but this location's service and food is superior to Yorkdale's. Service has been spot-on for all my visits. Food is very good with only a few minor gripes.  The Crispy Squid is tasty and the fresh red chilli peppers provide the perfect hit of heat. Only issue is it was cold upon arrival (happened before too).  Famous Planks of Cured Meats looks impressive but is fairly standard fare. Nothing wrong with it, nothing outstanding compared to all the charcuterie boards being served at restaurants all over Toronto. As for the seasonal vegetable plank, probably best to skip it all together.  Prosciutto & Melon was good. The basil pesto (it seemed to have a hint of mint) freshened up the dish.  The Crab & Avocado Bruschetta was unimpressive.  Spicy Meatball Pizza with 'Nudja is a must for meat lovers who like spice. Nice thin, rustic crust and 'Nudja on anything is delicious.  The Famous Prawn Linguine should deservedly be famous. It had the perfect amount of spicy heat, garlic and tender shrimp.  The free-range Turkey Milanese was a massive portion that filled a large oval platter. Fontina cheese was oozing out of it and it had nice crisp coating. The fried egg and shaved black truffle really elevated the dish, while the greens with a very lemony vinaigrette provided a nice hit of bright acid.  The Grilled Pork Chop, the accompanying roasted veg, and spiced apple sauce and salsa verde was tasty. The pork chop was well seasoned, however quite dry. Coating the meat in the sauce, oil and pesto helped moisten the meat.  Desserts were excellent. Had the Tiramisu (so good with many delicate layers) and a very tart lemon cheesecake balanced with some berry compote and torched meringue.  I have to reiterate that the service was exceptional from hosts to server to manager. Most of the food was absolutely delicious with only a few misses and some temperature issues. For a restaurant that's been open less than a week, it's far better than most that have been open for years."}
{"text":"Before writing this review I wanted to come back a second time to see if it would be any different. I would like to say I left here the second time even more unsatisfied than the first. I really had high expectations for this restaurant, since it is a celebrity chef's restaurant and all. The service overall is acceptable, but not over the top, maybe because they are still new. But the food here is very underwhelming. I am actually confused as to how some of these people was able to give good reviews. The first time we ordered Gennaro's Chicken Primavera, Crispy Squid, and Pork and Fennel Meatballs. The chicken was dry and the squid was chewy. The meatballs was the only thing I liked. The second time we got the Jamie's Italian Burger with Spiced Fries and Artisan Breads. I haven't paid for bread at a restaurant in my life before and this was the first time, so I expected it to be good. The bread was dry and cold, the burger was dry and burnt to a point that it tasted bitter and the fries was soggy. The flavour of the food here is decent, but the execution of these dishes needs improvement."}
{"text":"Sadly I'm only giving this restaurant three stars and that was mostly for the impeccable service. The restaurant is beautiful very nice open kitchen lots of staff and as I said service was impeccable. With that being said I really had a high expectation and the menu was Innoway a little limited.   We ordered italian nachos and they came as described - little stuffed air light flufy ravioli with a tiny bit of cheese inside and a tomato dipping sauce with parma on top.....kind of tasteless  really  We ordered burgers: two with truffle fries and a side of a Garlic Aioli  and a side of their special sauce they  - they  were very good ....the burger was a little tasteless it was a very good size, the toppings were great but the meat didn't have much flavor. Another burger came with polenta fries and Georgia said those were really good. Lynda had gluten-free pasta penne with tomato sauce and salad and she said it was very nice.  We ordered coffees and I had a double macchiato espresso which was very nice, Georgia ordered a brownie which for $9.95 I thought was a little outrageous for this very small brownie with a tiny scoop of ice cream on top and Irene had a cheesecake that looked very nice I forgot to ask her if it was good. All in all the meal was nice because it was shared with friends but I don't think that this would be a restaurant that I would return to, it's a little pricey other alcohol is a little pricey .....their variety of wines was very nice.   The menu had a couple of salads there was some seafood there was lots of pasta and there were pizza's.... but all in all I was really expecting something a little bit more of a variety from Jamie Oliver. I was expecting maybe a family-style menu where you could order - you know his special of the day, possibly lasagna or cannelloni like family style with a beautiful big board of salad something very similar to what he will cooks on his shows and my expectation was not met."}
{"text":"When I first heard that this restaurant was coming to square one, I was really excited as Jamie Oliver is a big name. However, after visiting the place on a Sunday afternoon, it did not meet my expectations and was mediocre, at best. Neither the service nor the food was anything remarkable. We ordered the garlic bread starter and watched it sit for 20 minutes because our server did not pick it up. The bread ended up being cold and stale and we were given a new one, which wasn't much better, to be honest.  The pasta dishes are not much better than what you would get at a chain restaurant, which is disappointing considering the price. Overall, it's  not terrible, but it's not great. If you're looking for good Italian food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is just the most boring restaurant. Average service average food average environment, but expensive price."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this place.  The hostesses are airheads.  They said that the bar area is a first come first serve basis, and then told us that the two empty tables were reserved for others.  hmmm.... hmmmm?!?  Anyways, had the calamari which was pretty good.  The server said that it was made fresh and never frozen.  Also had the prosciutto and arugula pizza.  There was a lot of prosciutto on it.  The beer seems small and the place seems overpriced for what they offer.  The bar table area does have a good view of the mall, you can people watch at ease.  Had to hunt down our server in order to pay.  Not cool if you have a ride waiting for you to pick you up."}
{"text":"What struck me the most about Jamie's Italian is its service. I was at the Starbucks next door before meeting my friend for dinner, and I had half a cup of my drink left. Our server told us that no outside drinks were allowed in the restaurant, which makes sense. I was expecting her to say that she'll have to take it away, however, she offered to pour it into a cup for us to be more discreet. I was pleasantly surprised by that! Our server was also really patient when answering our questions about the menu.   Our food came really quickly after we ordered. I ordered the porcini fettuccine and my friend ordered the gnocchi genovese. Although I did like the pesto base in the gnocchi genovese and I liked that the pasta didn't feel too heavy, I felt that the dishes were average at best. They weren't too special and felt like typical dishes that can be found at chain restaurants. I'd say the price is consistent with other chain restaurants. I was a little bit disappointed in the taste, especially since the Jamie Oliver name was attached to the restaurant.   The decor of the restaurant was absolutely fabulous and I loved it. I also like how the restaurant is located in the mall, and it is really convenient to get to. Overall, despite the average taste, I'd come back again just for the service and location, but I'd get something else instead of pasta."}
{"text":"Was I expecting too much ...perhaps I was. The food is mediocre and the service not as good.  We visited for lunch and it was not as busy.  I ordered the shrimp linguini and my daughter The carbonara. She liked her but mine was just ok. I don't think I would visit again.  I don't mind paying the price if the food is really good."}
{"text":"2.5 stars-Final verdict!!!  Everything was great but the food!!!We came here on a Sunday evening when the restaurant was not super busy.Our hostess was super friendly and so was our server Nick.  The restaurant itself is very modern and contemporary looking with lots of seating and open kitchen concept.  The service rendered to us was quick and Nick was super friendly but our food was so average that I really didn't enjoy my experience at all.  So we ordered a burger kids meal which was almost $14.The pattie was super dry and the sweet potatoe fries were soggy.For $14 I expect them to put a slice of cheese in the burger but it was just a plain old burger with barely much flavoring to it and the bun kept falling apart my daughter was so disappointed since it was her birthday dinner.  Coming down to the pizza-i would give it a 3/5.It was dry and lacked pesto.It wasn't anything out of this world-a little of mine was burnt too.I mean I could taste the burnt dough, it wasn't like a pleasant wood fire lightly burnt taste.  We also ordered a prawn linguine which was decent, the sauce was flavorful and the shrimps were fresh and yes this dish is garlicky which I don't mind.But the dish wasn't was soaking in sauce felt like I was eating a Thai curry bowl rather than a pasta dish.I hope that's evident in the photos.I wasn't too fond of the linguine either I mean I know they make it in house but I thought it was a little too thick for my liking and general Italian standards and mind you I have had authentic hand made linguine.  The highlight of the meal was the epic brownie with ice cream and caramel popcorn-it's definitely a must order here.It was moist and delicious and the popcorn were amazing.  Overall a very disappointed experience here-I definitely don't see my self coming here any time soon."}
{"text":"I was SUPER excited to try this restaurant. I had high expectations, but unfortunately it fell short.   I started with an appetizer of the avocado salad. HUGE PLATE. At first glance, you'd think you get alot, but its just the salad spread out, it was quite pricey too.   The main was ok. Honestly, wasn't more than just East Side Marios.   Was really a bummer. I have no complaints on the service though, that was great!"}
{"text":"I'm over in Canada for a trade show and decided to eat here last night. Just want to say it was exceptional !!!!! Skyler the manage and his staff took great care of us, the food was delicious, we had the Beef Carpaccio and the tagliatelle bolognese and both we delicious. Thank you guys we will all be back."}
{"text":"Walked in after 7 pm and hubby and I were quickly seated without a reservation. The restaurant has a casual vibe and open concept with lots of wooden panels, red and blue leather booths and bench seating, and red pendant lighting fixtures. The kitchen is also open concept so you can see what's going on.   The menu has lots of choices of salads and appetizers, pizzas, pastas, and mains. I appreciated that most of the pastas (except for the gnocchi) could be made with gluten free penne. Hubby ordered the porchetta which a friend had recommended. The porchetta was good although a little fatty for my liking. The skin was deliciously crispy. There was an apple pur√©e and a few roasted vegetables but the serving seemed small and the plate fairly unfilled. The famous shrimp linguini (with the gluten free penne) was delicious and had a good kick from the chili pepper in it. I did miss the usual al dente bite of freshly made wheat based pasta. They cooked the GF penne to the right doneness but it felt \"light\" compared with regular pasta.  Overall we had a decent dining experience and the food was tasty. The food is on the pricey side, but I would have expected this from any restaurant bearing a celebrity's name."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the Linguine Pomodoro and the Tomato Bruschetta. The food was very unappetizing. The pasta was firm and the bruschetta was overpriced and tasteless consisting of just a slice of cold bread, some cheese and tomatoes."}
{"text":"I like the people watching tables near the front but the chairs are god awful to sit in!   The bread is delicious, mushroom pizza was topped with a lot of flavor.   Their polenta bites were crispy and cheesy on the inside. The server put in the order wrong at first and sent over fries instead but no hassle in correcting it.  The superfood salad was meh, very odd tasting.   Pricing is the same I think from the Yorkdale location.  I'd come back for apps and drinks but I can find better Italian close by."}
{"text":"The pasta is okay, food is overpriced because of the restaurant's location. Personally don't recommend it. (And personally don't recommend having any meals inside the shopping centre)"}
{"text":"The food is really awesome and just hits the spot but of course, with all Italian food, a run on the treadmill will be required soon after. It's all about the dough, y'all!!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly overhyped, it's very basic and honestly the menu wasn't as extensive as I thought it would be. I wish they had more meat options! Also - the food itself did not feel fresh in the sense that it was kind of bland and typical (like I could probably make it at home!). Probably wouldn't come back here again    Smashed potatoes - wish they had more flavour/butter   The service was amazing though, very caring and friendly people!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both occasions were quite good, not outstanding but good. The location is only good if you are going to the mall otherwise why would you want to fight square one traffic and parking to go to a restaurant. The first time I came we did apps and drinks, we got the polenta and the crispy ravioli, both were really good appetizers. This last visit I got the margherita pizza and added on saut√©ed onions, they had just ran out of the vegetarian pizza special (it was only 2pm! That was disappointing and should not happen at 2 pm), my dad got the crab arancini. My pizza was cooker perfectly so the crust was crunchy and not soggy middle, the sauce is really good there. My dad really enjoyed his food as well and said the flavours were great and inventive. It was far too loud in there and this is after the lunch crowd or so you would think. I was basically having to tell across the table. The service has been good both visit, but it feels like a chain and being in the mall takes away the charm."}
{"text":"Rustic/industrial decor. Not bad. I had the Heritage Tomato Salad for $15.95. Very refreshing! However, my accompanying Jamie's Mojito for $9.95 was more crushed ice than mojito. Would love to try the pasta or pizza during the next time we're there. If it wasn't for a dinner date elsewhere a few hours later, we would've chose more from the menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions. Our server was rude and inattentive. We ordered the pork belly and crab spaghetti. I asked about the small portion as directed on menu waiter told me don't bother it's literally 3 spoonfuls for 4 dollars less. Was i glad I ordered the full size which would have been a small portion at most restaurants. It was spicy and i could not taste any crab. The pork belly was crunchy and flavourful but it was a sliver not what I would describe a main. With a 5 oz glass of wine and beer our total before tip was 69.00. Atmosphere felt like a cafeteria or fast food."}
{"text":"**Update**  Can't believe I gave this place 4 stars before.. dropping it to 3 now, but it's more like 2.5  Service was slow and terrible even though the place was practically empty. Our empty plates stayed in front of us after the appetizer and far into eating our main, then our server passed the table many times when our main was finished and didn't grab our plates then either. You would think they could've cleared them by the time we got our bill but no such luck. Ive never paid a bill and left before my empty plates have been cleared, wow just the absolute worst service. My pasta was way underdone. We ordered the vegetable platter for $10 and what a rip off that was, the only thing good on there was one of the cheeses which size-wise was a joke. The rest of the seasonal veggies they throw together in a small bowl in the middle so they all taste the same. Everything has meat or seafood except one or two dishes, so it's not too great if you're a vegetarian (however didn't ask if they offer tofu as a replacement). Very small menu. Dessert menu was not very appealing especially since I tried the tiramisu before here and it wasn't good. They got rid of the salad I liked so much last time .. boo. Will not be back!   First review: 4 star  First time here I ordered the rigatoni pomodoro and the heritage tomato salad. Pasta was cooked absolutely perfectly, not one second overcooked! Also it was delicious, all the ingredients tasted well together, for one of their more simpler mains I was very impressed. Cheeses on both dishes were very fresh and tasty, also they use the real kind of Parmesan brick that they shave on to your dish as you please. Thumbs up for real parm. The salad was better than expected, heavy on the tomatoes (obviously considering the name), if you like tomatoes you'll love this. Salad was fairly big, I also got the marinated chicken which was fresh, juicy and a big size. I'm not a huge salad fan but I will order this salad over and over again when I come back, it's really that good. Also ordered two drinks, a ceasar and the hurricane. Ceasar was just average, also a fairly small size. The hurricane was much better, very citrus-y. The dessert was tiramisu, which in my opinion was not that great, wouldn't order again. I am a tiramisu fanatic and this one probably lands a 6 on a 10 scale. The restaurant is quite nice, a very rustic atmosphere. We had a very polite and friendly server but the service was slow the night I went (Friday evening) although they were about 90% full. I would come back based on the mains, and try a different dessert next time as well. Also hoping to have better service."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of celebrity chefs but I am a fan of Italian food.  So what am I supposed to do when I'm invited to dinner at Jamie's Italian at Square One in Mississauga? Being open minded, I go of course!     I ordered the Parma (Margherita pizza with Prosciutto and slices of Parmesan along with Arugala) along with a bread appetizer.  The bread was okay but not worth the $6 charge but the pizza was really good.  It still doesn't top some of the authentic Neapolitan pizza joints in Toronto, but it certainly competes.  There's nothing better than a pizza that pays as much attention to the crust as it does the toppings.       I finished off with an Americano (very good) and an orange zest laced tiramisu.  I thought this was a nice touch to what is an often ill attempted dessert at most restaurants/bakeries.    Prices were fair and service was on point.  If you like Italian food, don't let the celebrity chef name scare you away."}
{"text":"I have given this location several tries before posting this review, I was so disappointed at the lack of authenticity of the restaurants menu and lack of flavour in the food!   The customer service was good but our server had a hard time getting some dietary information from the kitchen for one of our vegan guests. Which was frustrating.   For the price there are far better options available in the Italian food department. Sad because I really wanted to like this place.   I had the mushroom pasta, forget the name of it. The pasta itself was fresh but was lacking in salt and dry, not enough sauce. I had to cover it in Parmesan for it to taste anything resembling the price I paid for it.   If you're looking for good Italian find another place, this isn't it."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time and this place was 'okay' in terms of food. Its a hit and miss in my opinion. My pasta dish was a little \"watery\" when it came to me but I didnt want to complain just because I was already hungry and I didnt want to waste time to wait again.  The price ranges from 10-20+$ on the menu. So its fairly inexpensive since it is a nice, casual restaurant.   The place was aesthetically pleasing and am glad its located inside the mall for easier access after a good run of shopping. There is also an entrance if your coming from the outside.   The staff was also very nice and accommodating despite it being busy.   Overall, I would recommend going here despite my three stars... I WOULD have given them a four but I need to go back there again to cement that."}
{"text":"I came for cocktails and stayed for an app  I was pleasantly surprised with the drinks although a bit over priced I guess your paying for the name oh well it is what it is ..but it was good and I did enjoy it and would recommend anyone trying it if your in the mall !"}
{"text":"Horrible, like all of his other restaurants in London.   A friend brought me to this place to try, I was very hesitant as I was quite familiar with Jamie's other restaurants in the UK. All horrible, and this is no different. Very expensive for food with no taste and no creativity. Would not come back ever."}
{"text":"I came in with high expectations, expecting great food but I was not impressed. The service and cleanliness was good but the food was nothing special. We ordered the pea and ricotta ravioli, artisan bread basket, and the shrimp linguine. The portions were decent, and the plating was nice, but man did the food suck. I didn't not care for my boyfriends ricotta, he said it was OK, but overall both pastas tasted quite bland. The bread basket was quite good, but then again it's really hard to screw up bread.   Probably won't return again."}
{"text":"Ordered the prawn linguine and it was really good.  The sauce was not too thick and the prawns were not overcooked.  The service was great as we were there from 7:30pm to closing and no one was trying to rush us."}
{"text":"I'm of two minds about this restaurant. In some ways the customer service was great; in other ways, it was not.  First off, when I made our reservation, I was asked many questions about our group's needs: high chairs or stroller space for the children? Any special diets in the group? Any other special needs?  The morning of our lunch, the restaurant called me to confirm the reservation and our needs, which was nice.  When we arrived, though, our table had not been set up for us, and once we were seated we had to wait quite a while for our drinks.  The food, however was good. I had the prawn linguini -- light and tasty, but it was struck me as odd that the entr√©es came with nothing. No \"side salad\", no vegetables, no bread.   I ordered an arugula salad - which was quite good - but it just seemed strange that an entr√©e would come without an accompanying side dish or bread.   Pasta without bread? It feels like the customer is being \"nickled and dimed\" by having to order and pay extra for bread.  Again, the service was spotty - friendly, but not very attentive. We had to flag someone down to get drink refills. One of our group was served her salad long before our entrees arrived. The rest of the group were given their salads at the same time as their meals. One person never got the salad she ordered.  We finished our meal with the polenta cake, which was very tasty.  Finally, I noticed that, despite the restaurant touting itself as being \"family friendly\", there is no baby change table in the women's washroom."}
{"text":"I have gone to Jaimie's twice now. I find their pricing to be pretty decent with their fresh ingredients. We had their fried calamari both times and it it highly recommended I love it! I am normally not a fan of restaurants fettuccini alfredo and I make it at home and I find it not as fresh, however Jamie's got two thumbs up from me with their porcini fettuccini. My boyfriend ate their burger which was also very tasty especially the fries!!!  And for dessert we got their brownie with caramel popcorn and vanilla bean gelato! Will definitely be going again in the future"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick snack. Loved the decor and the atmosphere. Quite spacious place with high high ceilings.   We ordered:  1. Refresher(Fresh Lemon Juice, Elderflower Cordial & Cranberry Juice Topped with Lemonade)  Drink wasn't bad it was quite refreshing.  2. Jamie's Mojito(Bacardi Superior Rum, Martini Bianco, Fresh Mint, Lime & Sugar, topped with Prosecco  3. Mushroom Fritti (Herby breadcrumbed Portobello Mushroom with Garlic Mayo)  Portobellos were crisp and the mayo was very tasty!  4. Heritage Tomato Salad (Fresh & Slow Roasted Tomatoes, Whipped Ricotta, Herby Croutons, Basil, Pine nuts, Crispy Capers & Arugula)  Salad was refreshing but the tomatoes didn't really taste like they were roasted.  But regardless it tasted pretty good.  We'll come back to try more of them other Items next time."}
{"text":"We came to Jamie's for a small birthday dinner (4 people) on September 4th. Restaurant was half empty. The waiter was very chatty. We've been at Yorkdale location before so we knew what to expect. So we ended up waiting for beer for 30 minutes, steak instead of medium was rare, waiter did not come over for more than 15 minutes, it took him 25 minutes to bring the bread, coffee was served after the deserts, he simply forgot that we've ordered tea. Being very nice, we left the tips. I explained that the experience was very disappointing and I'm not sure we would return here again. Instead of apologizing (or at least saying something like \"thank you for the feedback\") he simply said \"Ok\"."}
{"text":"Tried a BUNCH of different items here, ranging from the Pizza Margherita (quite good and literally the only thing on the menu that wasn't child sized) to the desserts.  Unanimously, across the board, value was among the worst I've ever seen.  Flavors incredibly average, and pretty much every menu item should be at least $6 less since everything is tapas sized.  Honestly the portion of $18 spaghetti carbonara they served was laughable, me and the wife split it in two and it was honestly 2 forkfuls..  Just awful"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner as a surprise! Loved the atmosphere, definitely had that Jamie Oliver vibe to it! We shared the bruschetta, spiced fries and the spinach ravioli and everything was extremely good! (Get the garlic sauce with the fries it is to die for!)  Staff was super friendly and the open kitchen was really fun to watch!   My only small complaint was that I would have personally preferred the bruschetta bread to have been warmer when served. I understand it may have lead to the cheese melting but I doubt it would have lasted long to allow that!"}
{"text":"This was not a great choice to go for Italian food . Will never go back , the food was mediocre at best and the service was pretty bad as well . Do not recommend this restaurant at all ! Even the atmosphere was like a cafeteria"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening for dinner with my friend! We were seated immediately, super clean and the decor is cozy! We ordered the garlic bread appetizer to start and i thought it would be warm bread or something exciting considering the name of the place it was just sub par hard pita crisps squared that were not got andno taste of garlic, do not recommend! On the bad part the steak and fries entree sooo spicy and salty i am still hurting and it was too much!   I thought this place would be better, i really was ready to adore this considering dinner for one was $45! Don't think i'll return!! Rest of the menu looked too boring and expensive to pay $30 for pasta with meatsauce.. or a piece of grilled salmon!!    Service was spectacular"}
{"text":"We had a girlfriends' afternoon lunch on Sunday, Sept 17 at this venue. I had the prawn fettucine, and my friends had Spaghetti bolognese, Veg Gnocchi and seafood pasta.   Pasta is approximately $20 a plate..and it was good.  Serving size is average, my pasta was al dente, although my friends claim theirs is a little overcooked.  Sauce was ok, I guess.  What forces us to write this review is the fact that they dont serve any bread at all along with yr pasta order (considering its quite pricey, and this is a typical italian resto, that's surprising).  When we asked for it, they told us that they dont serve it but we can order bruschetta as appetizer.  Each bruschetta order is about $8 and only has 2 slices. One of my friends who ordered iced tea asked for a refill..there was no free refill to her order as well.  The bill for all of us (with taxes and tips in) came to $110.00.  Considering we only ordered 4 pasta dishes and pop (San Pellegrino, diet coke), that's really steep.  Not worth your while..you are only paying for the Jamie O name."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a few of my friends and thought it was just decent. I think Jamie's is one of those chain restaurants with very few standout dishes but surprisingly great service (looking at you, Milestone's). This place is on the pricier side (dinner was over $40--no drinks, shared a starter and a dessert), but the restaurant itself is gorgeous, and if you make the right choices, you might even have a stellar meal!  ARANCINI - Deep fried little risotto balls with a peppery tomato sauce, molten mozzarella on the inside, and bird's eye chillies. Sounds good right? Nope. Surprisingly dry, lacked flavour. (3/5)  GNOCCHI - Such a pretty dish. However, I thought it was quite odd that they paired a potato pasta with crushed potatoes and garnished it with (essentiallly) potato chips. Again, the seasoning for this dish was so off--the gnocchi itself were well seasoned, but the rest of the dish was essentially tasteless. The pesto didn't even have much flavour. So disappointing. (2/5)  FRESH CRAB SPAGHETTI - This was alright. Perfectly al dente pasta, if anything, the sauce was a bit fishy. (3/5)  TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNESE - Delightful. Not spectacular in any way, but the flavours were all there. A safe bet if you're a meat eater. (4/5)  PRAWN LINGUINI - Absolutely delicious. Best dish of the night. Sauce was bold, not heavy, and super tasty. Will order again! (4.5/5)  BURGER - So average, in every way. (2.5/5)  SPICED FRIES - Delicious! A great side. Thin, crispy, well seasoned. (4.5/5)  BROWNIE - Reaaaaal good. The bitterness of the caramel popcorn, the fudgeyness of that brownie, and vanilla ice cream to top it off? What an incredible combination! (5/5)  TIRAMISU - Horrendous. Probably the worst tiramisu I've ever had in my life. Never again. (0/5)  All in all I'll probably be back, but I'll definitely stick to the dishes I know were good."}
{"text":"They just opened 3 days ago and it's so busy and that's good so the place is amazing and cool atmosphere and great service and the food is amazing and fresh and I enjoyed my experience so I will be coming again . So I high recommend this place !! Try the Pasta"}
{"text":"I had the best pasta dish here in recent memory. There are not a lot of places that do squid ink pasta so I was immediately drawn to the Squid and Mussel Spaghetti Nero ($23.95). It comes with squid, prawns, and mussels in a semi-clear sauce. The dish is incrediably fragrant, well seasoned and pasta is perfectly al dente. Absolutely delicious. I think I had the best dish at the table, even though I was the only one without the liberal grating of permesean. Would order this again the next time I'm here.  For the restaurant space itself, it is a large space with plenty of rustic touches.  There are plenty of tables but it gets filled up quickly so we had to wait 30ish minutes for a table of 4. A good idea to put your name on the wait list and browse the shops nearby as you wait."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, but it was such a downer. 3 stars only for the wonderful customer service and friendly staff. Otherwise the food was just so-so. We had the arancini & another forgettable appetizer to share. I had the seafood nero (squid ink pasta) which in theory sounded great but was just ok. I've had better, cheaper more authentic italian in scarborough and vaughan. Skip this one guys, not worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place for the pasta. I ordered the mushroom fettuccini. It was delicious and very filling. I also ordered the funky chips. Fries with rosemary and garlic, was delicious but I wished it came with some sort of garlic aioli instead of just ketchup. Service was okay. Asked for a refill of water near the end of dinner, the server acknowledged but didn't bring anything. We just paid and left afterwards."}
{"text":"Jamie's Italian restaurant serves good quality pasta and their pork chops. I had their prawn pasta and rightly so, they were bigger than expected all right! I had the chance to try their pork chop and it was not dry at all - would recommend those two dishes if you plan on going.   I tried their crab avocado bruschetta before and I think it's too small of a portion for me to enjoy for the price"}
{"text":"I went with some friends last night and it was alright but overall we weren't impressed with our experience. It's one of those things where you drop $200 on a meal and your expectations fall short.  Service was great, our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  For appetizers we shared the burrata and it was great. Definitely give this one a try.  My friend had the turkey milanese and it was tasty, but served only a bit warm. Actually all of our entrees weren't served hot, but just slightly warm. The restaurant was maybe at 70% capacity so I was surprised at that detail. My main was the spicy meatball pizza. Our server came by with freshly grated cheese, which was great, but it wasn't spicy at all, like not a hint of spice.   Dessert was good as well, we had the tiramisu and sorbet. Both were good for the price you paid but not really worth getting into detail about. Standard stuff you know?  Overall it was only ok and we expected more from a celebrity chef restaurant. Based off our experience I  wouldn't revisit but I hope your experience is better!"}
{"text":"- Bland food - Good service (was a Monday eve so no crowd) - Substandard ambiance  - overpriced considering the food was nothing special.   We ordered: - chicken lollipop for kids - dry and bland  - garlic bread & tapenade - good but very little portion  - chicken cacciatore - flavorless/ I added salt - burger - standard nothing special.   I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"wood interior suspended charcuterie visible kitchen  cages full of cans tomato sauces galore very italian  prompt waitstaff service though awkward, taking orders using smartphones? uh  scrumptious margherita plenty of cheese and basil nice sprinkle of salt  great crunchy thin crust though, difficult division with a fork and knife  on the pricey side but that pizza was top-tier it isn't bad here"}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. We came here during opening week excited to try Jamie Oliver's first venture into Mississauga. We started with an appetizer special which was a spicy eggplant dish with artichokes on top of a buttered crustini which was delicious. We found the serving a bit lacking though considering it cost about $11. My gf ordered a funghi misti pizza which was delicious and we would definitely order again. The portion was decent for a personal size pizza. I ordered their famous prawn linguine which tasted good but I did not find that it was anything special. I felt like the prawns were just regular shrimp and I enjoyed the pizza a lot more. We finished off our meal with tiramisu which we both enjoyed.   The service was great as our server was very friendly and personable. The only downfall is the value you get for your money as I feel that the portions do not justify the high prices. Definitely a place to try but only every so often."}
{"text":"Delicious for lunch  The decor is upscale rustic. The seat waiting time for lunch was 20 minutes so we took a table at the bar area with no waiting. We loved the superfood salad and the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce. My daughter's 7-item pasta size small was tiny, but flavour wise was good enough. - last visited October 2016"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars but the food is really good! There's just a lot of things that fell below our expectations. We went here three times since it opened so I know that it wasn't just a one time thing.  Their portion sizes are way too small. I eat very little and never finish my food, so it's crazy that I'm complaining about portion sizes. Generally when we go out, we get 1 appetizer, 1 main, and 1 dessert to share. The first time we came here, we got the bruschetta, a pappardelle pasta, and a chocolate cake. The bruschetta was two tiny pieces. It was really good, but we would've had to order three of them for it to be enough for an appetizer. We left still hungry after that meal and it cost us around $75.  The second and third times, we went with a third person, and upped our orders so everyone had their own main and desserts, which made up for the portion sizing, but we still weren't full after our meal.   The other problem is with the service. The waiters seem to seat us and then forget that they seated us. We were ready and waiting for almost 20 minutes before our waiter finally came back. Then once we finished our food, the waiter was nowhere to be found for another 30 minutes.  If they fix their portion sizes and their service, this could be a really good place to go in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Went to Jamie Oliver at Square One for dinner. The environment is very modern but a little dark in terms of lighting. Service was exceptional and the food came at a reasonable time. We had made reservations with OpenTable so there was not a wait. Pricing is expected of this class of restaurant for \"premium\" Italian food. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Service is still very informative, friendly, slightly less attentive depending on how busy it is when you visit.  The reason why I lowered my rating is:  1) portion sizing (Fried Calamari - pretty darn small.  Yes, it's not from frozen, which is good, but maybe good for 1-1.5ppl) 2)  Mojito - Suggestion of the waiter and the glass was more than 50% crushed ice!  I wished I had taken a photo, but I am not exaggerating.  Barely any liquid...or alcohol for that matter.  Not really a great way to win over the customers  I was leaving before my friends, and it did take quite some time to get the cheque."}
{"text":"3rd time eating here but the food for me is still \"just ok\". I have ordered pasta most of the time and its always been very saucy. Not that I'm complaining but somehow I feel like bread should still be included in this type of meal. Actually, few months ago I had ordered the zucchini pizza which was one of the special that day and it was pretty good. It's kind of a hit or miss I think. Some dishes do lack salt thats for sure. Service was quick but she didn't mention the special to us. I didn't ask her about it for this sole purpose. I would come back only if I get invited for dinner but I will not recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Good food without being exceptional, great service and open kitchen ambiance was also fun.  The unusual dishes were the mushroom starter and the tiramisu with orange zest, both excellent.  Fresh olives on ice were also delicious in its simplicity.  Amongst the mains, shrimp linguine was good with plenty of shrimp and the crab spaghetti was average as there was barely any crab.  Pasta itself was perfectly al dente and fresh.  Al dente fresh pasta is an art, which is done well here.  Overall we enjoyed hanging out, and we would visit again to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The service was fast, friendly and knowledgeable. The food was ok. Not great. The pasta portions were small with no side salad or bread included.    The gnocci was super garlicy and is still repeating on me. I got 1 and a half under cooked purple potatoes and my soda never arrived.   My boyfriend got the spaghetti which was pretty good. Each dish was around $20 and were meatless. Not sure if there was an option to add meat.   The value for the money was not worth it.   Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the food was decent. The service, however, was a different story. It took forever for our waiter to take our order. We all ordered the Jamie's Italian burger and we all asked if we could get garlic mayo on the side. Our waiter wasn't rude at all though which was nice. The portions that you get at this place does not match the pricing. We got the crispy squid as an appetizer and it was so little that we could barely share it (there was only 3 of us). When our main food arrived, they only gave garlic mayo for two of us. We told them that we had ordered 3 and if we could get an extra one. The girl that brought our food was incredibly rude. When my friend asked for an extra mayo she said \"well that's going to cost you extra\". Yes, we know it will cost extra. Honestly it's not worth coming here. Take your money to a better place with better service"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the seasonal vegetable bruschetta, margarita pizza, and another vege pizza (forgot what it's called and strangely not on the menu online, it had tomato sauce, roasted veggies, cheese, potato, onions, and parsley)  When the bruschetta came, we honestly thought we got the wrong order because it was literally one slice of bread with the veggies/pesto on it. We were underwhelmed to say the least.  It lacked flavour and it was cold! NOT WORTH $10!!!!! It was not even good enough to make up for the insane price. DO NOT get any of the bruschettas!  The pizzas however saved the meal from totally going south. They were a decent size and both were delicious! Flavourful and very thin crisp crust.   The total cost of the meal was $50 however which was not worth it for essentially 2 mid sized pizzas because honestly that one slice of bruschetta didn't even count. Not sure if we will be going again considering the price and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Amazing! Calamari was amazing. I had the crab spaghetti which was delicious. Our server Nick was very nice. Great experience."}
{"text":"We've come here for lunch about five times. Our go to is the arugula salad and one of the pizzas. Last time, we took advantage of their lunch special and had the tagliatelle bolognese with the salad. Everything has been delicious and the service has been first rate every time. We highly recommend and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.  The menu seemed fun and not terribly over priced compared to others. However, when the food arrived, it was either far too greasy or way too salty. Neither of which is a good idea. Whether intentional to have you buy more overpriced drinks or not, hard to say.   I got a very standard pizza. When I say standard, the toppings were interesting, but what i received was standard. Nothing to write home about or put a famous name against. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"They rammed my disabled uncle and his 5 friends in a very tight 4 seater table . mind you due to my uncles condition we don't go out very much, but considering it was his birthday we thought we would give this place a try. When we asked to change spots to a larger table, the server huffed and puffed and said that they would have to start over and change the system, insinuating pretty much the hastle. The food sucks and it really just does a disservice to Square one. Shame. I'd take the Chinese food court food they took away \"gourmet Chinese\" or wutheva as opposed this this. Accommodate for the disabled would be nice at the Very least for basic human experience."}
{"text":"Pasta dishes were great ! I was a bit disappointed in their bread appetizer as it really lacked flavour and was very dry, in comparison to places where you don't even have to pay $5 to buy it off the menu.  For young children please inspect the clasp in the child seat. We were given 2 broken chairs before 3rd was safe for use and we could settle in to order."}
{"text":"I loved the food here.  Yes, it is a bit on the pricey range and it definitely has its pros and cons.  Con:  My boyfriend and I started off with the crab bruschetta and although the flavour was all there, it was definitely not enough for two people let alone one.  It was basically ONE very thin sliced bruschetta bread with crab and all it's fixings on top of it. We were not expecting ONE thin slice of bread for the amount we were paying ($11.95).  We basically had to divide this small piece of bread in half and shared it amongst the both of us.   Pro:  I had ordered the gnocchi genovese and it was delicious!   As far as the appetizers go, if you plan on going with someone or a group of people, definitely ask what apps they recommend are great for sharing."}
{"text":"For barely mediocre lousy service thought it would be nice because it's in square one but it's notttt it's just over priced n it doesn't match quality"}
{"text":"When I first heard Jamie Oliver was opening I was excited. Jamie and Gordon Ramsay were always chefs I follow. The atmosphere in this restaurant was lovely and casual. Upon sitting down our waiter presented us with menus and took our order shortly after. They have an electronic ordering system, so it looks like the waiter is texting, but he really isn't.   The food was fantastic. It was fresh, very tasty, well seasoned and not overly salty, peppery or bland. My fianc√© and I both had an app, an entree and dessert. This would have been a 5-star rating but the portion size the the price you pay was too small, even for Jamie's. $10 for a single slice of Bruschetta (although it tasted very good) and $30 for an inch wide slice of salmon was asking a lot for the size of the portions.  Overall it was a great experience. Service was awesome and food was tasty, but a tad expensive. Would I come back? Absolutely... But maybe next year after I've saved a little."}
{"text":"Pricey...but then again, what else would you expect with a famous name and in a location like this?  The food and atmosphere are both amazing. It's upbeat and fun and the service is great and friendly. The food is great from the appetizers to the entrees.   Definitely a great place to have a work lunch or go on a date night!"}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant goes against what Jamie Oliver believes in: fresh, homemade, real food. I was pretty surprised to discover their breads and desserts aren't made in house, and also disappointed that it meant the only option for someone with nut allergies like me was sorbet.   The food was hit or miss - my coworkers didn't have great things to say about the squash bruschetta or the tomato salad, but they liked the polenta cake (although not made in house) and we all really enjoyed the porcini fettuccine! And if I want to be nit picky, I'll mention that the Pimm's Cup, although good, was not authentic at all.  My overall impression was that it just feels like any other chain restaurant and nothing really wowed me enough to make me eager to go back."}
{"text":"I was waiting for a special occasion to try Jamie's Italian. So when the day finally arrived we went there for dinner and then went again after for lunch, based on how much I enjoyed it. During my first time there, I fell in love with the restaurants sophisticated decor. It was classy but yet not too uptight. We started off with the bread basket, which came with an assortment of breads e.g. ciabatta, focaccia, and some crisps (which I did not like tbh), accompanied by a sun-dried tomato and olive tapenade. That tapenade was so good, to the point where I almost licked the bowl clean. My mum got the funghi misti pizza and my brother got the crab spaghetti. I got the super grain salad with chicken. The portion sizes were perfect and service was friendly and attentive. Now to the food. Since having that salad, I can't see any other salad the same way. It felt less of a salad and more of main meal, since it contained mostly grains and lentils. But the avocado and harissa layed on top really amplified it to something extraordinary (and very filling). My mum is a pizza snob, as she has on the regular and therefore tends to be very picky. According to her, this was one of the best pizza's she's had in the GTA, which says a lot. My brother praised the pasta a lot, especially concerning the fact that they were cooked to perfection (\"al dente\").  Yes, this place is a tad pricey but it was definitely worth every dollar.  When we went back for lunch I got the same salad and my brother got the porcini fettuccine, which were both, again, delicious! I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you've been to SQ1 and to Moxies, Earls and whatever other restaurants they got in there - This one's different. They got a better interior and walking into the place I felt like I was at a restaurant but also at one of those cooking shows, where you see the chef's in action - minus the swearing from Gordon Ramsey. I tried the Meatballs here and they were dope - a little smaller in Size. I did a pizza which has mushrooms and some other goodies and that was BALLER ALERT! Their pizza's here are great - the crust has this softness and just that RIGHT pizza bite. I havent been here for a second time to make sure they maintain that consistency. Service was good as well. I would go back here if we have a group of people going or if I felt like a close to home Pizza."}
{"text":"We decided to go here after trying the one at Yorkdale and as it is fairly new we weren't expecting too much but this one is just as good, if not better. It seems like they aren't as afraid to use seasoning here as everything was delicious and perfectly cooked.   We had the crispy squid, tomato and ricotta bruschetta and arancini marinara to start and I can't fault any of them. They are more generous with the marinara sauce at this Jamie's and the sauce with the squid was amazing. The bruschetta was something new for me and I'm very glad I tried it, it was simple but the flavours were all there.   For our mains I had the fresh crab spaghetti and my husband had the spicy meatball pizza. At the other Jamie's I wrote that their spaghetti was a little bland/salty but here it was perfect, well seasoned, big chunks of crab and zero regrets for trying this dish again. As for the pizza, at first my husband was disappointed as it doesn't come with any cheese (apart from when they offer to grate some Parmesan over the top at the table) but his opinion changed pretty quickly once he started eating, the spicy sausage and meatballs were amazing! He even said that this was the best no cheese pizza he's ever had!   Dessert, we shared lemon meringue cheesecake. The husband loved it, said he wanted all his lemon meringue pies to now be cheesecakes. I was more on the fence, it was good but I didn't feel particularly strongly about it either way.   The drinks were all good. I had the hurricane and something else with amaretto (can't remember what kt was called) and both were fresh and well crafted.   I also have to mention the kids menu. It comes in print but also in those old school little 3D glasses where you push a button and the picture changes (check my pictures.) this is genius, it amuses the little ones and also lets them actually see what they're ordering in a very fun way. They're also provided with crayons and paper to draw on so overall, very thoughtful. 100% will be returning here."}
{"text":"Disappointed! The food was good but not great. The prices don't reflect the quality. Way too high prices for drinks and basic main entrees. The service staff was way too efficient, took away our plates before we were done. While the restaurant was half full, lots of empty tables for a Thursday night.  I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place.  Wait an hour for a table to be ready.  We got: Olive starter Brushetta starter Meatball Parpadelle And vegetarian pasta $80  The olive dish.  I'm not a fan of olives so I'll give it a pass.  Very basic   Brushetta was 1 slice of baguette and I honestly expected maybe two pieces since we were sharing... the waiter didn't mention it wasn't enough for 2 people.  Pasta was prob the worst Parpadelle I've ever tasted in my entire life.  It honestly tasted like one of those microwavable pasta dishes.  The second vegetarian dish was terrible had no flavor. I wouldn't recommend trying pasta, although I don't think the rest of the menu would be much better.  The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of the service.  The guy that served us was very nice.  Explained the menu well and had small conversations with us.  I don't recommend this place.  Waste of money"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was better than average. I guess all reviews are relative to the writer's experience as I had low expectations of a chain restaurant located in a shopping mall.  I will go back when I visit Mississauga."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant two times now and each time I really enjoyed my food.  The first time I ordered a salad that was the special for the day.  The second time, more recently, I went for lunch and ordered from the super lunch menu.  I ate: Appetizer: Crunchy Italian Nachos - this was OK but let's be honest, these are not nachos. It is exactly what the description is: Crispy fried ravioli stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta & Bella Lodi, served with spicy Sicilian tomato sauce - and should have a name that properly reflects that. Main: Spaghetti carbonara - yum. So good and creamy. I would order this again. Dessert: Italian Style baked cheesecake - so delicious.  I also tried: Appetizer: Roasted squash and ricotta bruschetta - this was good but my only complaint is that you only get one piece of bruschetta.  Really small serving if you ask me. Main: Porcini fettuccine - this was good, I'd order this again. Dessert: Orange blossom polenta cake - cake flavour was unexpectedly good.\\  All in all, I really enjoyed my food here. If it's your first time visiting note that the servers take your order on their phone so they're not being rude - you slowly realize this as you're ordering.  My only complaint is that the server took my dessert away without asking when I wasn't paying attention (was playing with a baby) and I still had a few bites left and had every intention of finishing my dessert. The server also attempted to take my appetizer away before I was done eating it and had to stop him from taking it.   My other issue with this place is that it's not cheap.  I'd recommend going for lunch to get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Coming into the restaurant, I was met with a very friendly waitress who was just part of the excellent service. However, this was perhaps one of the very few redeeming factors of my experience, as my food was very subpar. I had ordered the prawn linguini, which to my disappointment had a very small amount of a weak sauce that was far too watery to have any impact on the linguini itself. Coupled with the already weak flavor of the dish, it also contained an almost unpleasant amount of garlic that overtook any flavor that the dish may have had. With a disappointing entree, an overpriced menu, and past experiences of flavorless meat based dishes, it is relatively difficult to recommend Jamie's Italian to casual and formal diners alike."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Jamie's Italian restaurant when I visited for the first time a few months ago. I was very disappointed when I got a burger with the patty as thin and tasteless as a McDonald's cheeseburger. It was incomprehensible how they could serve that sad burger in a mall where you can find a real gourmet burger in the food court for a fraction of the price.   I wanted to like this place, and I was willing to give it another chance and try something else in the future. I went again last night, ordered a chicken sandwich this time. I was expecting a nice juicy and tender chicken breast, and I got an unrecognizable tiny piece of chicken. My heart sunk again when I bit a chicken joint cartilage, I removed the cartilage, tried another bite, got another joint cartilage, I picked out the remaining joints and I was left with a tiny piece of chicken. How can a tiny and thin piece of chicken have so many joints? They got an unwanted part of the chicken, opened up three or four times to stretch it. I felt helpless with the server, he is not the type that would care or listen. He saw all the chewed up pieces of chicken left on the plate and he didn't bother to ask if there was anything wrong with the food.   I didn't want this bad experience to ruin my evening, so I didn't complain. I asked to refill my Pepsi, and I was going to enjoy my fries. The server told me that there was no refills for the fountain-watered-down Pepsi and I would have to pay for another Pepsi (c'mon Jamie, this is not the UK). So I said that I would gladly pay for a real Pepsi in a can or bottle because it is not watered-down, and he told me that the watered-down is the only option available. That's when I realized that I wouldn't give any more chances to this place. Not because I had to pay a couple of dollars for another drink, but because of:  - the poor quality of the ingredients; - the misleading menu that doesn't indicate you are getting the \"knee\" of  the chicken instead of the breast; and that you are getting a McDonald's cheeseburger instead of a gourmet burger.  - their misunderstanding of the North American market;  - their greed and arrogance; - and complete disregard to their customers.  I left the place extremely dissatisfied, helpless, hungry, abused, and robbed. I don't think this restaurant will stay open for too long, not everyone is willing to give it a second chance. Hope this review help others to choose wisely."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 on Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was more than half empty. They could accommodate us with one stroller, which we had to leave at the front, no problem. The food was ok. We had bruschetta with ricotta for starters and for mains we tried shrimp linguine, penne pomodoro, porcini fettuccine. The shrimp linguine and penne were incredibly al dente. Like... it was hard, too hard. Not enjoyable. The fettuccine was al dente but it had all clumped together. The strands were glued to each other, a sign of poorly prepared pasta. The taste of all the mains was mediocre at best. The bruschetta was incredibly delicious. I would not go back. Service was bad. We ordered a soft drink which arrived too late, after the meal was done. And our server seemed very bothered in general, he wasn't friendly at all. At the end he brought us one bill, without asking if we wanted separate bills. When we asked for separate bills he said he couldn't do it. If it was such a final decision, he should have asked us first. We had to ask for cheese, we had to ask for the dessert menu, nothing was offered by our server."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favourite restaurants! My friend and I stopped in for lunch around 12:30pm on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. The hostess seated us quickly and our waiter was quite attentive at the beginning of our lunch.  The menu had a good amount of dishes and we ended up choosing the garlic bread to start. To be honest the garlic bread was more like garlic flatbread but it was still tasty. My friend ordered the Gnocchi Genovese ($19.95) and she absolutely loved it. Well worth the price. She also got the homemade lemonade and said it tasted like Sprite. Perhaps it needed more lemon in it.  I ordered the Gennaro's Tagliatelle Bolognese ($18.95) and it was so delicious! It had a pork and beef meat sauce slow cooked that was probably one of the best things I've tasted in a long time. Did you know their pasta is handmade? You could definitely taste the difference. I also got a ginger mojito and it was tasty and refreshing.  The lunch rush picked up and it seemed that our waiter forgot about us well after we stopped eating. I'm pretty sure we waited 30 minutes after we finished eating before he even got to our table again. He needs to work on this.  Other than the service, everything was amazing and I definitely have to come back here for more delicious pasta."}
{"text":"We came for a family dinner Sunday night. The overall ambiance, food quality and service was exceptional.! Would definitely come back. Oh the brownie is out of this world!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't read any reviews before going but did have some expectations knowing that Jamie is a celebrity chef.  We all went for a family dinner night but weren't too impressed. Upon sitting down and placing the order, we were surprised to see that we didn't even get served any bread at the table while waiting for food. The food service did seem a bit slow to us. We had to ask for a few things through the course of the night. I wasn't too impressed with the portion sizes. Although I can't say the food wasn't flavorful  But didn't excite us much  The worst was that after finishing our meals and appetizer, we were still hungry. We had to buy bread so ordered garlic bread. What a disappointment that was- it seemed like a store bought pita naan with some Ghee and garlic thrown on it. Believe me that's exactly what it was. And it cost us almost $9. The fries were good, probably the best item The chicken sandwich was just ok... The salad had toooo much dressing on it. My wife left half of hers untouched coz of that. The ambience was very nice, I must give them that. Will I go there again? Maybe not"}
