{"text":"This place reminds me of being back home in the UK.  The fish is always fresh and perfectly battered.  The chips are yummy and the coleslaw is just like Mum makes.  I have taken to ordering the popcorn shrimp with sweet thai chilli sauce ... So. Good.    My Mum will generally have the hallibut and chips and has yet to walk away disappointed.  I refuse to go to other seafood establishments since finding the pleasent service and value for money dining experience at Sea."}
{"text":"I thought it was only an OK experience. Staff need to be better trained. A bit pricey for what you get.  I agree with Jag S. that the batter was a bit bland.  I hope the owner reads this because I do want them to get better.  I think it is a great location and a nice interior look.   I will try again and give an update."}
{"text":"Wow! I guess we had a very different experience than the other reviewers for this place. We ordered 2 pieces of haddock and 2 pieces of cod, and my partner opted for the yam fries. Everything was amazing - so fresh and tasty! We both preferred the cod, as the haddock was a bit dry (as it normally is, that's just the nature of the beast). The service was also excellent and our waitress was very, very friendly and pleasantly chatty. They only had lemon loaf for dessert when we went, but there is an amazing frozen yogurt shop (Yogurty's) in the same area to better satisfy a sweet tooth. If we didn't live so far away, we would probably come back often."}
{"text":"Loved it. The cod was cooked perfect, fresh and crispy. The servers working were great, they never stopped moving and were super friendly. Thanks for a great meal:)"}
{"text":"very disappointed, had heard good things and my Mother was dying to try here (she's English and loves good fish and chips) so off we went one Tuesday night. Small restuaurant which was half full, one server. We all ordered fish and chips and I ordered the curry sauce for the fries. Really, fish and chips is hard to muck up - fresh fish, good batter and hot crispy fries at a reasonable price. This place is expensive. Couple next to us, when she went to clean up their barely touched plates told her much they didn't like it, her response was \"you should have told me earlier\" - my reponse would have been \"you should have asked\" - anyway, I was still hopeful. Food was okay, nothing special but like I said expensive - curry sauce was horrible but unfortunately I put it all over my fries before tasting so I was stuck. I did try to catch her eye a couple of times to no avail. When she came to clear the plates she didn't ask why I hadn't eaten my food but I told her anyway and again \"you should have told me\" - I told her I did try to catch her eye and she shrugged. Nothing off the bill, no sorry no nothing so needless to say, won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a bit fishy indicting the fish is not really fresh. The actual fish is smaller than it looked cause of the batter... and it's over cooked. The okotoks fish and chips is way better than this one"}
{"text":"It used to be so much better, ever since the new owners took over the quality and service have definitely gone down."}
{"text":"I have been to Sea twice and experienced friendly service and decent food both times. I really like their Squid Vicious calamari appetizer (clever name!). It is delicious but kind of a small portion for the $9 price point. For an entree, I'd stick to the fish and chips rather than some of the other offerings. My husband did not care for the fish tacos ($12) which he ordered off of the specials board. He found them to be pretty bland. I've tried both the cod ($8 for one piece) and the haddock ($8.50 for one piece) fish and chips, they are satisfying, not too greasy.  Other reviews complain about Sea being expensive. As I mentioned above, some portions may seem small for the price but I wouldn't call it expensive. It's a small business that needs to cover its costs to operate. It is casual dining, not fast food, so you have to expect to pay a bit more than some other fish & chip proprietors."}
{"text":"zero consistency. I work near by and used to get poutin here often. when it was good was great. large portion lots of cheese and just enough gravey. next time no cheese and drowned in gravy cold fries.. its sad to see what was once a descent place run its self in to the ground. have to agree with the other yelpers staff sucks as cold as the fries obviously not impressed to work there."}
{"text":"I used to like it here. So much that I drive in from the North side of the city. Now I'm literally sitting in the restaurant writing this because my disappointment is palpable.  I hate confrontation, I will do almost anything to avoid it. Which is why when I walked in with a 7 year old I was perturbed by having to ask for a kids menu. Even worse when after asking for it, instead of getting it she asked if we were ready to order. Do you know any telepathic 7 year olds? Because I don't.  So we order two one piece cods and a kids chicken fingers (fish is still mostly evil). And we wait. And wait. And wait.  Finally food. Except the cods are tiny and mostly batter, the fries are greasy and almost the size of quartered small potatoes and the tartar sauce has gone down to the tiny little sample cups that you can fit the tip of your thumb in. Really?  But wait, kids meal is.... Fish. This place is small, it's hard to confuse the only child in here. But it's fish, not chicken. It makes me wonder what she wrote down.  But I hate confrontation, so the kid eats it.  She didn't give a menu to the next kid who walked in.  I don't know what happened, but I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying service was great and welcoming. At first glance, the menu looks reasonably priced and has ample choices. I was pleased to see that they offered a grilled or poached fish option instead of just deep fried. They were able to accommodate a special dietary request because the item was fresh to order. I chose the classic, fish and chips. My husband ordered crab cakes. I was sat facing the kitchen and was able to see most of the action in the kitchen. I was disappointed to see that they were using bare hands to dish the salad from the large storage container onto the service plate and also to transfer my fish from the cooling rack to the plate. Two separate employees did this so that tells me it's a common practice. The lady who used bare hands with my fish is also the server who deals with cash and customers. I just hoped their hands had been at least freshly washed right prior to touching our food and tried to forget about it. The portions are small. Husband was disappointed with the small size of the crab cakes. They are quite thin, and maybe, barely, 2.5-3 inches in diameter. He said they tasted good tho. My fish was not hot which was disappointing. It had obviously sat too long and not under a heat lamp. Some of the fries were undercooked in the middle and were just ok. I had high expectations for fresh cut fries!!! Fish looked like a decent size but the fish in the batter was thin. I really would like to go back and I love supporting small businesses in my community but the bare hands in the kitchen is really bothering me. I hope the owners or managers read this and start to use sanitary serving tools."}
{"text":"Have frequented several times but each time less and less impressed. The fish portions initially look large but in actuality tiny pieces of fish in A LOT of batter. Coleslaw tasteless. No plans to return."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here with an open mind. I had read the reviews and was hesitant. There was some confusion about the groupon and we could not upgrade to the halibut even though we were ok with the charge the server said it was not possible. We both had the haddock and it was ok. Nothing special. The fries were good, big and crispy. We tried the clam chowder and again, just ok. The server was very nice and very informative about the meals, she had a good answer for all of our questions. My boyfriend had a Guinness while we were waiting for our dinner and they keep their beer in a wine fridge so unfortunately it wasn't cold, thus not very good. I think I will try some other fish and chip places before returning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here and we have raved about this place to so many of our friends because it is literally the ONLY fish and chips joint we have found in Calgary that makes fish the way that they do in the UK. The batter is perfect!  However, lately I have noticed that they are decreasing the portions and leaving the prices at the already high amount. I have also noticed that there is a particular older staff member that does not write down our orders and subsequently messes them up. In one instance she forgot to order our appetizer while a table beside us (that arrived after us) had already received their appetizers AND mains... and in another instance she ordered the wrong main dish for us as well.   I really hope they work out the kinks because the food is delicious and we would like to continue to support this place!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Sea after a long hiatus. I am understanding now from previous reviews that the ownership has changed. This explains my recent experience and why it was so different than previously.  Sea is not cheap. In fact, considering the location and style, is fairly expensive. In the past, this was relatively excusable, given that the food was of such high caliber. I would even say that Sea was THE place for fish and chips in Calgary at one point. I've been on the hunt for a while for a place that could at least shake a stick at the west coast shops. So Sea was always relatively good for that.  What happened? The fish used to be served in massive portions, with ultra light batter and amazing crispiness. Flaky, just the right moistness, with a healthy dosage of sides. Can't say that's the case anymore. The fish was extremely greasy (though the batter was still fairly good), the sides were miserable and overpriced, the seafood chowder and an offense cut to the flavour, and even the fries were surprisingly disappointing. How do you make fries disappointing?  I  can no longer recommend this place, and would instead suggest one of the other local staples such as Boyd's. Not that I particularly enjoy the others in the city. In general, I'm more just disappointed that Sea has fallen from its previous greatness and now offers a generic run-of-the-mill albeit overpriced fish and chips experience."}
{"text":"O my.. I've been so excited to go here for so long and was completely let down.   Fish and chips consist of such simple items such as: fish, fries, tartar sauce, lemon, and coleslaw.   Fish - the fish was so sub-par, I think I've had the same (or even better when u factor in the fries) at Joey's Only fastfood in Market Mall.  The batter wasn't anything I would ever go back for and could probably make my own much better.  The worst part, after getting over the bland generic fish, is the FRIES. O god.. worst \"Chips\" (fries) ever. I don't think it's much to expect good quality fries. I'm not sure what to blame it on, the cut of the fries or the way they were cooked, they aren't crispy, and they aren't those big yummy fries either.   Lemon - they gave me one little piece with two pieces of fish. come on is it much to ask for two slices?   Tartar sauce - u get barely 1oz of tartar sauce, i'm sure they charged me for more.  Coleslaw - the exact same stuff you buy from the grocery store.   Not only does the quality of the food suck, but the menu is also outdated. The waitress told us that the menu was developed by the old owners, and they no longer offer some of those items and such... uh... poor business practice?   Needless to say, I won't be going back. I'll definitely check out Joey's Only on 130th next time."}
{"text":"Health violation notice posted on the door. Closed until further notice.   Owners had another note indicating their hot water tank is not working. Apparently they were running their restaurant with no hot water.  Hmmmm.... and how would they sanitize, well, anything?   Yuck!"}
{"text":"I just got home from a late lunch/early dinner at Sea. Fish n Chips. I'm pretty disappointed. While it wasn't dreadful, it definitely won't have me returning.   First, the food. I ordered the \"Jaws\" meal, with the halibut as my choice. \"Jaws\" comes with 2 prawns, 2 scallops, 2 oysters, fish, slaw, and chips. Sounds great, right? Well, not so much. I received a TINY spoon of slaw, a handful of chips (honestly, about 12-15 pieces?) and the seafood. The chips tasted as if they had been fried in old oil. Not very good at all. The prawns and scallops were decent enough, the fish was a TINY portion though (i'm guessing 2 oz. TOPS, which when paying the premium for the big meal with the premium fish, I expected a bit larger) -- the fish portion tasted fine, but I am dubious as to if it was actually halibut. (I used to manage a Fish n Chips place -- I can identify fish by taste/texture. It was more akin to cod or a haddock -- not dense like halibut usually is...hmmm...) The oysters though? There was something definitely off with them. I was actually frightened to eat them for fear of becoming ill later.... and I am not one to be persnickity usually. The \"off\" oysters now brings me to my next issue with Sea.... the service.   The service was friendly enough, but the server was completely inattentive. We were one out of the 2 tables in there and they didn't appear to busy with take-out service or anything. Both myself and my dining companion ordered coffee and we waited a very long time before being offered a refill. When we received our meals it was still awhile before we ever got more coffee, and she dropped our plates so fast that we couldn't even catch her to ask for more. (where she was off to, I have no idea... like I said, we were one of two tables) We never got any sort of quality check. I was waiting, and waiting, hoping she'd come by so I could let her know about the strange/off oysters, but nothing.... I finally went to the counter and told the young man, because the server wasn't even IN the dining area. (??) The response? \"Really? Huh. That's weird. Let me get your server.\" (I would have apologized...???)  The oysters were replaced with 2 other prawns, which was ok. But it was frustrating not having a check-up shortly after food was dropped.   I'm in the service industry myself. I am actually VERY forgiving with less than stellar service if I can see the server is overwhelmed with tables, or appears to be in training or whatever. Our server at Sea. just seemed to not really care one way or another. When she was at our table she was \"friendly\" I suppose, but I felt like there was no actual SERVICE.   Given the disappointment in food (value and taste), and service, I don't think I'll ever be back. Wouldn't get take-out either.   No wonder the place was pretty much a ghost town.... :-("}
{"text":"Went for some awesome fish and chips always good not too greasy! Service was ok. Nice and clean. Calamari is really good also! Would go again."}
{"text":"Good English style hand battered fish and friendly service. Nice prawn appie too. The only low point was the coleslaw as it had a strangely sour dressing."}
{"text":"First time eating here, probably won't be back.  I found the batter bland and the order was very greasy, dripping oil.  A little undercooked in spots.  Price was $21 for 4 pieces of cod takeaway, not worth the size of the fish pieces."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I've given this place too many tries hoping for a miracle. The batter is no good, so ordered pan fried, came out like cardboard, dried and shrunk. This place is a cute little boutique attempt at some kind of English fish and chippy joint but they've missed the whole boat literally. The food comes first, the high prices come second. It's not the servers fault they don't cook the food, they have to answer for it all. Shame on the ownership trying to gouge customers with a poor excuse for real fish and chips. Captain Highliner is better quality seriously."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. Food was horrible, service was horrible and unbelievably over priced. Be warned and don't eat here. I wish I could give a negative star."}
{"text":"On the way to the airport,  we stopped at Sea for a quick dinner.  Ordered the beet salad which was just beets. No salad. Also had the fish chowdah. Not good (very bland with a slimy consistency). So we tried to doctor it up and asked for tobasco. No tobasco anywhere in the restaurant.  No hot sauce whatsoever.  The 'Sea'sar salad was good and salmon fish and chips were ok.  We usually don't complain about food,  but after being talked into a huge bowl of the chowder (originally only wanting the cup) and being charged full price for returning a full bowl, i have to recommend you stay away from it.  Not sure how it remains on the menu."}
{"text":"I found myself craving this today afyer having it for dinner yesterday.  Batter amazing.  Coleslaw... best eva.  Staff super charming and sweet.  No one else in the place and the staff was cleaning bottoms of chairs.. not chatting and on phones.   This place got 5 stars for that alone.  Amazing..  i may have to go back again today!! Perfection  thank u!!!"}
{"text":"Does it look appetizing? No. Was it delicious? Not really the clam chowder did not taste great chunkys clam chowder in a can would have been better. The soup had a strong fish taste didn't enjoy it at all. Their coleslaw was way too over dressed and the French fries didn't even come with ketchup! It only got 2 extra stars from me because the salmon was good! I would order the salmon again but nothing else"}
{"text":"Small restaurant, but fairly good fish and chips.   I like the chips a lot, not salty.   The fish is pretty standard, nothing that stands out."}
