{"text":"Really bad place I have ordered 4x and those 4x they have sold me spoiled rotten rice and chicken. Already reported them to the health department . Most discussing place I ever ate at!!"}
{"text":"Great place for express Chinese food! My favorite would be Sesame Chicken, pork egg roll. Free Pepsi and delivery for over $10. The people working there are all really nice and humble Chinese. Especially the cute Asian who works there on weekends. Also, the cute delivery boy knows the area very well and great at delivery!"}
{"text":"I went here today after reading the reviews and ordered the chicken w/ broccoli combo dinner, shrimp egg roll and the crab Rangoon's. The good was that the chicken and broccoli was really good and the egg roll was good as well. The bad was that crab Rangoon's were cooked really hard and the flavor wasn't great at all. I love crab rangoon's and order them anywhere i go and these were lacking. The woman taking the order was very rude. She could definitely use some customer service skills. Will I go back? I always give a place 2 tries so I'll be posting again."}
{"text":"Met my mom for here during lunch time, which is the only time they have the buffet. Evenings are dine-in or carry-out, no delivery service.  We were greeted and invited to take a seat anywhere we like. The offerings are limited to one hot station, one cold station, and a ice cream chest of different flavors of ice cream.  The hot station contained your standard offerings, fried rice, lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, general Tso's chicken, chicken and broccoli, egg drop soup, hot and sour sour, fried garlic green beans, and more. The portions in the treys are small, however the chef from the kitchen was continuously refilling the goods - keeping everything fresh, we all know there's nothing worst than crispy morsels of fried rice!  The hot station contained some desserts as well, fried sesame balls and sugar donuts!  The cold station had seasonal fruit offerings, as well as canned, pre-made desserts, and tapioca pudding, which I had two helpings of.  I really like the offerings of all the different tubs of ice cream, there was cookies and cream, vanilla, chocolate, rocky road, butter pecan, and two others. It's self-serve too!  There is probably a saying, if you've been to one Chinese buffet, you've been to them all. But I really like the cleanness of Moonstar and of course, the choice of ice cream flavors!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Cheap, greasy, and delicious Chinese on the Lakewood/Cleveland border. I had my usual wonton soup, chicken & broccoli and egg roll and Ming Moon hit it all out of the park.   Delivery took way too long, but it was worth the wait. Something tells me that waiting almost an hour for delivery isn't the norm at this place, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  $10 minimum for delivery. The delivery guy also happens to know a lot about trees, so if you have one in your yard, he WILL talk to you about it."}
{"text":"I really liked this place back when it was in the strip mall that Bill's grocery store is in. We would get the take-out all the time and it was almost always good and tasty. Now that they moved into a stand-alone restaurant with a buffet the quality has really gone down hill. My family went for the buffet once and it was quite disappointing. I'm sure it doesn't help that buffets in general gross me out but the food was abnormally bland. At least a couple times after that we tried ordering take-out. Again, disappointing. Nothing like the fresh food we had gotten many times at their previous location. In fact, I'm 99% sure that the last time we ordered take-out there it was given to us from the buffet! Yuck. It wasn't hot or fresh tasting when we got it home. So, that's the end of our relationship with Ming Moon. Too bad because Oregon could use a good Chinese restaurant. Or Indian. Or Thai. I'm not picky if it's good! :)"}
{"text":"New location in the past few years and my first visit in a while. I first looked at the buffet and was very unimpressed so I ordered to go.  I had Happy Family with garlic sauce and it sucked. Bland and under cooked. No reason to go back."}
{"text":"For Chinese takeout, Ming Moon is pretty damn good. I always go with my usual combo: sesame chicken, vegetable fried rice, and one shrimp egg roll. The chicken pieces are lathered in a thick, tasty sauce and lightly sprinkled with sesame seeds. Sometimes I find that they're not always very crispy but that's only because the chef literally stuffs your to-go plate to the brim, so no complaints there! The fried rice is very flavorful and not overly greasy--the same can be said about the shrimp egg roll. My mom always orders the spicy scallops/shrimp with mixed vegetables and this dish, too, is delicious. I don't know what's in the sauce but it's to die for. I'm warning you now that ordering can sometimes be a drag, especially if you need to make alterations or inquire about a dish because the female employee/owner does not speak very much English. Her son is fluent and helps if he's around but even if he isn't, I'm sure you'll survive."}
{"text":"Man this used to be our place. The past few times the food has been awful. And they also started forgetting stuff ex: gravy for Egg foo yung, Duck sauce, Fried rice for entree ect.  I will wait a few months and try them again but for now, I have wasted too much money on overcooked, bland and not fresh food.  If youre reading this Ming Moon get a new cook! Please!"}
{"text":"Never again. Extremely dry General Tso's chicken, tiny pieces of chicken wrapped in extra breading, crab rangoon had pea-sized cream cheese inside overcooked dough , and they shorted me an egg roll in my order. Fried rice was good though."}
{"text":"Reviewing just the vegetarian food, a very big fan of the bean curd and ma po tofu. The vegetable egg roll was very crisp and tasty.  The service and attention was very spot-on. Bathrooms are clean. I'm curious how the buffet is and look forward to trying it sometime. It's a very typical american-chinese menu but with very good vegetables and tofu(some places aren't as fresh in my opinion)"}
{"text":"Nothing here is bad, I will say that. At the same time it does not have anything that will really knock your socks off good either. Its pretty traditional Chinese food with some seemingly exotic attempts at authenticity but none the less it is still good in my opinion. I have been a sucker for the hot and spicy shrimp, chicken, beef dishes. Generous portions, great egg rolls, good prices. Only real Chinese place we have in Oregon so whats not to like?"}
{"text":"I, like many others, ordered Chinese take-out on Christmas night. I ordered the General Tso's chicken combo, a sweet and sour chicken combo, wonton soup, and an order of crab Rangoon. The lady who took my order was very friendly, the delivery was crazy fast (like 15 minutes fast), and the delivery guy was also very friendly. Most importantly though, the food was awesome. It was piping hot and fresh. I'm so impressed. Sometimes you order Chinese and immediately regret that decision, not this time and not one bit. I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"My steamed dumplings came out cold. How is that even possible? We were the only ones there. Egg drop soup was green. Entrees were bland and flavorless. Bathroom was really clean though so that's a plus right?  I won't be here again. Very disappointing. Bummer."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have the buffet with my daughter. The buffet was low or out of most of the food choices, and they were never refilled. We asked when they would put out more and we were told they wouldn't. The server said she tells her friends not to eat at ming moon any more"}
{"text":"On a whim I decided to try Ming Moon--I'd been going to a competitor up the street. Ming Moon is now my \"place\" for Chinese.  They are fast, friendly, and everything is made fresh when you order."}
{"text":"I cant complain and the people here are very nice.  I usually call ahead and its always read in \"5-10 min\".  Orders more than $10 and they throw in extra stuff...$20 and even more extra food......Lets face it, when you go to these take out places all menus look the same.  Usually I try to find one thing I like and stick with it.  They are open till 11pm Sun-Thurs and 12 on Fri and Sat"}
{"text":"Oregon is fortunate to have a Chinese Restaurant in town where you can eat buffet or order to go.  I finally got a chance to check this place out and I have mixed impressions.   The portions are the typical large amount which is great,  they advertise that they use no MSG in their food which is also terrific.   The flavor was nothing spectacular and I found this disappointing.    I ordered a hot spicy dish and there was no heat to it at all.  The vegetable egg rolls were very very good though.  The decor is not very pleasant but the place is clean.  If they could step up their flavors and spices they could move this place up to where it needs to be.  BTW, the left over white rice was pretty much awful the next day.  Had to toss it.   We didn't care for their stir fried veggies too much."}
{"text":"Beat choice in 15 mile radius, at least, for Chinese food.   My family's favorite crab ran goons anywhere.  Reasonably priced.  Very quick."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for lunch at Ming Moon at 2:30PM because we had never been there before and it was on the way to our event that started at 3PM. The biggest complaint was the young woman waiting on us. We felt as though we were intruding instead of being welcomed. She brought our appetizer of steamed dumplings and left. The dumplings had not been drained long enough and were served in a plate of water. We had to ask for plates as she brought none. Less than a minute later the main course came out before we had even started our first course. My friend's sesame chicken was very good, but my cashew chicken was just barely ok. The vegetables were undercooked, almost raw. The tea was good. I will never return."}
