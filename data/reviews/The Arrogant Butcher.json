{"text":"Great place and cool staff!  Cool atmosphere too.  Always good to know another great downtown spot!  Sit at the food bar!  The cooks are so awesome to talk to and you always have people taking care of you!  Crab legs are amazing too!!!"}
{"text":"Was told great things about this place but was left disappointed. We started out with oysters on the half shell, and a cheese and meat platter. Can't really go wrong with those (as long as everything is fresh, which it was). For dinner, we asked our server what she recommended. The sea bass was so highly recommended by our server (Amber) that 3 out of 7 guests ordered it. When we started eating it, the 3 of us were shocked by how flavorless the fish was and the side \"salad\" it came with was a mystery to all of us. We weren't sure if we were eating corn or noodles or weird oats. We all returned our nearly $40 dishes and ordered new things. The waitress messed up the order and split the scallop ravioli between the three of us. The scallops were chewy and the thick cream of the sauce left me feeling nauseous. The server had a really hard time remember our requests throughout the entire dinner. The only reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars is because they took off the sea bass charges, comped our split ravioli and had good apps. Don't think I'll be returning any time soon. :("}
{"text":"Jambalaya in Phoenix?  Just had a great bowl of jambalaya. I lived in Cajun country for three years, so I know it when I taste it.  Fresh ingredients and a great local beer to wash it down. Chef even delivered it and stopped by after to give me the scoop. Now I see why 1000+ rate this 4+ stars. Thanks ROBERT!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I had great customer service and the food was soooooo good. I had the Grilled Salmon with Yukon Gold Potato, Roasted Mushrooms, Cipollini, Green Bean, Sherry Mustard Jus. Fresh, cooked to perfection. Loved it! If ever in down town Phoenix definitely make your way here."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to be invited to the soft opening at the Butcher.  Wait staff was exceptionally attentive and whatever we ordered was complimented by another similar item off the 'brunch' lunch menu (by 'accident' of course, but you know they were seeking more input on the recipes). Started with a mimosa and coffee, both fresh and aromatic.  Fresh squeezed OJ for the mimosa, a nice surprise. Sampled the cinnamon toast: fresh in-house made rustic bread with nooks and crannies that would make any Thomas' english muffin jealous.  A perfect combination of butter, brown sugar and cinnamon to cover those flavorful bread curves.  Not too sweet so it may not meet your taste buds if you have conditioned by the the overly sugared American fare.  Toasted just right but the plate was a bit cool, so get to them right away while still warm.  They brought out a plate of cinnamon toast with almonds that was just as tasty. Smoked salmon benne style followed as one entree and sausage & egg baguette the other.  A third entree of bacon egg and cheese  with avocado on a soft roll also arrived as a 'mis-order' that we had to try as well. The smoked salmon (in-house smoked) was light, flavorful and cooked before sandwiched between a perfect poached egg (yoke soft but not runny).  Eggs Benedict done exceptionally well.  The plate could have been larger to display this elegant compilation.   The sausage flavor made the baguette, bringing a savory spice to the eggs and peppers, as well as slightly soaking the inner layer of the baguette with juices.  Not like as mightily as say a Mr Beef in Chicago or Luke's here, but enough to grant your senses a pleasant reminder of au jour times. And while not on the same field as the other plates, the bacon egg & cheese on a soft roll was nicely executed. All the plates came with a side of potatoes delicately fried.  The potatoes were light and clean in taste but perhaps could have been kicked up with red pepper or cajenne to clarify the kosher salt.  A S'mores latte served as the dessert finish.  A fun, original and witty drink presented with chocolate and spices melted over the soft marshmellows.  enough said, we will be 'checkin-in' sooner than later."}
{"text":"We live and work downtown and find Arrogant Butcher consistently good.  The menu is imaginative, with many main course, small plate, and side dish options so one can make a big meal from several small plates or order a main with or without sides. And now they're open on Sunday on which we enjoyed dinner last night which included oysters on the half shell, smoked garlic, artichoke hummus, beet salad, and jambalaya with shrimp, chicken and sausage -- all quite good. And server Brent did an excellent job."}
{"text":"After a 20 minute wait on a busy night with a convention in town we were seated and our drink order came out quick. Our waitress helpful. I had the surf and turf filet with lobster topping. Perfectly cooked and delicious. Others ordered ribs and carnitas. Both enjoyed their meals. Wait staff was attentive. The atmosphere was fun and the patrons happy and having fun. Good vibe. This is a good \"go to\" in downtown. Here I think you will get your moneys worth. Our primary waitress got the orders to us fine but seemed to be having a bad night."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great service.  I reco pretzel roll turkey pastrami.   Decor is great, nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Wow, first time there and the server was one of the worst. Food was mediocre at best, especially for being the Saturday evening special. Very loud atmosphere, generally uncomfortable. Our experience downtown has been great. Sorry to end our weekend on such a downer. We should have listened to our friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here, especially for their happy hour.  Their appetizers are hard to beat.  The cheese/bread/jam combinations are delicious; and the pretzel fondue is addicting.  The main menu is just as delicious, and has a great variety.  We've yet to find something we don't like.  The service is quite good as well, some waiters can be a bit spacey, but for the most part they are good and quick.  My only complaint is that they close far too early, even on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday night with some friends on our way to the Orpheum. The place was packed and there was a line out the door, but thankfully we had reservations so we got right in. The food and drinks were incredible and the staff treated us like royalty. Unfortunately, I didn't get our waiters name but he is one of the best waiters we have ever had. A friend of mine who has traveled the world,said this is her new favorite place. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We were in town for a couple of days and looking for a bite on Saturday night.  After we checked online and saw no available reservations, we called and they told us that since it was a huge tourist weekend (the last of spring training), they were holding most of their tables for walk-ins.  So we headed down and were quoted a wait of 15-20 minutes.  Off to the bar!  The place seemed pretty packed and buzzing.  A couple of local brews later, our table on the patio (as requested) was ready.  Service was perfectly friendly and helpful.  We shared a plate of ham, mustard and bread to start.  I had the sloppy joe, my boyfriend had the pastrami sandwich.  Food was solid, but short of phenomenal.  It's a fairly curated menu considering the size of the place.  You know where you see 6-7 options that sound just okay but nothing that sounds like \"OH MY GOD I HAVE TO EAT THIS NOW\"?  That was pretty much my feeling towards their offerings - hence the sloppy joe.    Only hitch was that I ordered a glass of wine and wound up getting charged for a bottle - a fact I didn't catch until I reviewed the receipt the next day.  But I gave them a call today and the management happily agreed to refund the difference.  (Thanks guys!)  I was happy with their selection of wines by the glass - they seem to make a point of serving some of the less available varietals.    We don't come to Phoenix much, so I'm not sure we'll be back.  But if you're staying downtown or attending something at the US Airways Center, this is a good option for an easy bite."}
{"text":"The business name is appropriate - arrogantly providing a less than exceptional value.  Drinks - a few sips of liquid but mostly ice.  Food - $8.00 antipasto was a small cube of cheese, a few paper thin slices of salami, and a few marinated olives with a teaspoon of mustard and a teaspoon of cherry compote.  We were supposed to get a couple of slices of bread but had to ask three times and wait ten minutes to get it - by then the entrees had been sitting there for five minutes.  The Thursday night chicken special - highly recommended by our waiter -  was basically \"OK.\"  The  short rib stew was a bowl of gray gravy with very little in it - really had to search for any evidence of short rib meat - a few very small bites were finally located.  The locatiion is terrific - sitting on the patio people watching before a Suns game was enjoyable.  The waiter was reasonably attentive except for the bread problem.  Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, but the food is nothing special. The highlight was the Butchers Platter charcuterie- a delicious variety of meats, cheeses, and accompaniments. It was also a good value for the amount of food provided. Our cocktails and entrees were fine, but lacked sophistication and overpriced.  The service was prompt and friendly, but I'll likely not be back since I can get more interesting and higher quality for this price point elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had an amazing night there right before the ballet they were fast friendly and the food was great we will defintally be going back"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Very small menu, but everything I had was quality. The service was right-on. We were in and out of that place in 40 minutes and it was pretty busy. The AB cheeseburger was a good choice. We also had the prosciutto appetizer which was a bit pricey ($11) for 2 pieces of bread and 1 oz of prosciutto. But, overall a good place to eat before a suns game/event at the US Airways Center."}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner here before the Symphony. It was excellent. The main entrance was a little tricky to find. It isn't actually on Jefferson but is around the corner off First Street.  But once we found it, it was a great start to a great evening.  We shared the pretzel fondue as an appetizer. There was plenty for four people. The pretzel bites were soft with that wonderful pretzel crust. Cheese was warm and was plenty.  Our table ordered the filet mignon with creamed spinach, carrots and potato.  It was cooked perfectly to medium.  Coming from the Midwest, I am picky about my steak and am rarely satisfied with beef outside of the region. This was quite possibly the best filet I have ever had this far west.  The pork chop was more of a pork cutlet (no bone) and had a very flavorful breading and a mushroom gravy that really defied your usual mushroom gravy standards.  The sweet potato tortellini was spectacular as well.  The tortellini was large and generously filled.  Personally, I think the tortellini was too rich (if there is such a thing)  but delicious.  The service was excellent. Everything arrived just when we needed it to and was piping hot.  The decor is upscale but casual to dressy casual.  There a lot of people who looked like they were just coming from work and others like us who were starting their special evening out.  The noise level was moderately high but we all were able to talk with one another without yelling across the table.  The wine list was mediocre.  Nothing particularly special about it.  Their mixed drinks and beers were more note-worthy. I suggest the Pink Drink if anyone likes a fun version of a Cosmo. It was a healthy pour.   We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good service.  Staff was friendly and energetic.  They left you to dine, but still paid attention.  Still, at little 'over the top' with friendliness (anyone ever watch Office Space...well, I met the female Brian...friendly, but 'over the top').  So the pretzels were supposed to be fantastic and they were good with the cheese.  But Rock Bottom (chain) serves better.  However, Tabouli salad was very tasty.  Overall, it was a good experience outside near the Suns stadium, but, the food was average.  It's part of a larger chain where they just change the name of their locations...so don't be fooled, this isn't a local establishment such as as Three Doors Down in Portland.  For what it's worth...decent food, good service, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have you tried the Prime Rib, best in town.  My girl loved it!"}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing. Convenient location and parking was very inexpensive after validation. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally found a good restaurant in PHX! Sat at the bar for a glass of wine and mussels appetizer. HUGE portion of large delicious mussels! Delicious. Thank you for not serving crappy Mexican!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy anything about this place.... The decor is o.k. but the food is so bad that it really didn't not matter what the place looked like. First we started with the mussels recommended by our server and they were very bland, nothing special. So we tried again with the pretzels and cheese fondue (If everyone else was eating it how bad could it be?)  Not worth the $10 for the appetizer... nothing special about the cheese or the pretzels. the rock shrimp were good, a little small, but really the only thing that I could stomach at the table.  The deep fried cheese and bacon fritters were dried out and when I put them in my mouth it felt like I was chewing on salty, raw, uncooked dough... Thank god the bf and I split the fillet or should I say \"hamburger\" I know better ordering steak from a place like this but he wanted to try it.... I don't know how they get the hamburger meat in the shape of a fillet but they somehow managed to pull that one off. The \"after school special\" cocktail that sounded like a delicious margarita with a splash of modello, was literally the worst alcoholic beverage that I have ever tasted. I am not picky when it comes to food, wine, or booze.... and this place sent me running for the hills.   And now for the finale of the review, I got food poisoning! After about an hour or two I was so sick to my stomach that we had to go home and cancel our plans for the rest of the evening.   How in the world this place has so many rave reviews is beyond me.... literally the most disappointing meal of my life. No chance you will ever catch me near this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The food is good. The kale salad is my favorite. Slightly over priced but an overall good experience."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I would recommend the green chili stew w/ a fried egg!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, the cheese platter and cold cuts were wonderful."}
{"text":"I had the tortellini.  It was ok.  The flavor was a little flat.  Prime rib was chewy and iver priced.  Waitress took my plate twice before I was finished.  I had to ask her for it back.  It was obvious she was rushing us.  Overall I'm like \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent customer service. Our waiter made recommendations to us about the food and what was his favorite. The dinner tonight was delicious.  I had the filet and Marty had the meatloaf."}
{"text":"We went for apps before Disney on Ice. The pretzels and zucchini fritters were tasty. The service was great! And the drink menu had a lot of options which is nice."}
{"text":"We visited Arrogant Butcher before the UFC fights. LOVE this place! Local favorite and fills up fast when there are events downtown! Worth a wait but if you can call ahead or make a reservation or get there early to avoid the wait I would recommend it. All of the Fox Restaurants are amazing & local favorites. If you haven't tried all the Fox restaurants, I highly encourage it as they are all different and delicious! I have eaten at this location twice before events, once the busy & hustling bar (despite being immensely busy, the bar service was really good & they keep high levels of coverage/ bartenders!) and once at a table. I loved the sweet potato tortellini and the crab stuffed chicken. My husband enjoyed the steak. Great wine list & drink menu. This is my FAVORITE go to restaurant before events."}
{"text":"we were treated extremely well and were taken care of, even though we were 10 people.  Got our own private little room with excellent service. The food was top notch and the staff was very friendly. Love loved this place"}
{"text":"Ate lunch on the outside deck before a Phoenix Suns game. It was around 5 so I tried \"The fix\" $5 cocktail during happy hour. Amazing! Tried the zucchini fritters while waiting for entrees. The sauce it was paired with made it truly mouth watering. I ordered the jumblaya. It was a big portioned bowl with just the right amount of spice. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak cooked medium- he said it was the best he'd had in awhile! So marinated, he didn't even need sauce. The patio was very clean however there is a lot of traffic on the corner.. The women's restroom was also very clean, I wasn't a big fan of the lighting but it was very trendy, and spacious. With chairs and a full body mirror. Our waitress was very attentive but not hovering- making sure to refill drink or clear plates as soon as we were done with them. After being offered dessert, we were given the check and didn't wait long at all to have our card back and attend our game."}
{"text":"The hubs and I went to AB last weekend for dinner. The food is ah-mazing! We sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails. The service was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. He had the short rib stew.....OMG! if you like stew, this is the one for you.  It's almost like a chili verde as there was a delicious green chili flavor. It came with a corn muffin that was a nice compliment to the stew. I had the seared scallops plate. The scallops were cooked perfectly; \"succulent\" is the word that comes to mind (I never use that word!). For dessert, we HAD to have the butterscotch pudding....and yes, it is as good as everyone says it is!! We'll be back..."}
{"text":"So on a spur of the moment trip with my family (to see Basketball-March Madness) in Tucson, we stopped at the Arrogant Butcher in Pheonix. We were lucky enouhg to get a table after a short wait. The food was amazing. One of us has the Halibut Fish and Chips and it was as good as it gets. I had the most amazing Kale salad with almonds and currants that rocked my world. I also had crab cakes, pan seared not deep fried. Super fresh. We all loved our food, the house wines were really good. So why not a five star rating? Our waiter, he was arrogant. He took the name of the restuarant to heart. Which is crazy 'cuz its really loud and laid back. He just was a lousy, judgemental waiter. Other than that I highly recommend this restuarant!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of FOX Restaurants, but just had an ok experience.  The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.  We decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.  The food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.  Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.  Overall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.  Oh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.  Make sure to dip in."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher was one of the best meal experiences I have ever had!  If you are in Phoenix, you must go.  We had the mussels as apps and pretzels - both were amazing(and I am not a pretzel fan). Both the swordfish and rib entree we're great.  My son had the ravioli dumplings. The flavor was good, but it was a lot of very filling food.  The atmosphere is cool and casual, but their commitment to food is serious!"}
{"text":"Went here before the Jason Mraz concert and the Rock Shrimp appetizer, beers and cocktails were very good, however the service was a little slow. I ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles, a glorified Bigmac, what a disappointment."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great; but there was nothing about it that I would really come back for. It is a way from where I live and the fact is I wouldn't go out of my way again to eat there. It's like Chili's or some other chain restaurant. Everything is good but nothing is \"Out of this world\". We had the green chili stew and pot pie. The stew was not very flavorful and was disappointing given the hype from the waiter and the posts on Yelp. If your in the area, try this place. If not, save your time and go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is great- short menu never changes- basically comfort food but all done very well. The problem is that they can't seem to coordinate service. Waiters are always pleasant but if you order your app and main course at the same time expect that both will come VERY quickly right after the other. However, drinks seem to take forever, and often are not correct. They just cannot coordinate the food with the beverage, nor at any pace other than fast food. That is consistent after many visits ( I did say the food was good). Last time, our mains arrived while the apps were still on the table- literally grab the last bite of app and then immediately start the main- while the glass of wine I ordered to go with the main arrived in the form of a martini after the dinner was already consumed. Gets busy so book arly- maybe eat at the bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat if you are downtown for a game or concert. We tried the Sirloin (excellent), turkey pastrami sandwich (very well seasoned meat on a soft pretzel bun, Short rib stew (a keeper) turkey sloppy joe (outstanding). We took the Salted Carmel Pudding to go and we're glad we did. It was to die for. This place will go on our must eat list when we are at the AZ SkillsUSA Championships."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Overpriced and wretched food. I ordered the $27 seabass and I was served a previously frozen, dried out hockey puck that resembled TV dinner fish. Sent it back and got the $18 canned Campbell's stew...errr I mean....the short ribs stew. Awful. The appetizer was the 'world famous' pretzel fondue which you could order from any TGI Friday's or Chili's for a few bucks less. I'll never go there again. I'm usually not this hostile in my reviews but these guys should be ashamed of themselves for their menu prices.."}
{"text":"Went to the bar, no acknowledgement after a few minutes, got up and left, no body cared, to concerned w/ their wknd plans to worry about a customer leaving unserved, disappointing Sam Fox!"}
{"text":"The appetizers and entrees were wonderful.  Our party of 16 experienced several items on the menu.  Celeste was knowledgeable of menu, patient, pleasant and full of energy.  This is an excellent place to unwind from a Day of meetings."}
{"text":"I love this place!  In fact I went a couple of times. . Once to their Happy Hour which is 3PM until 6PM (even on Saturdays) and then for lunch.  I love Fox restaurants but even though I've lived in Phoenix for 7 years had not tried this one. Just recently moved to downtown Phoenix and take the lite rail home. It's in a great location and I ordered the hummus which was outstanding. The people next to me ordered the pretzels and decided to order them next time. I also ordered the Rum drink and it was so good. A few days later, I was early for their Happy Hour but so hungry ordered lunch. I got the squash salad and it had an interesting ingredient...gingersnaps!! Delicious!  Also ordered the pretzels but there were so many, could not eat all of them so they were wrapped along with the cheese dip to take home. Service was outstanding and very nice atmosphere. I will definitely go to the Happy Hour again.   I was so impressed that I told a lot of my friends about this place too."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar due to busy lunch crowd.  Good service.  Decent ambiance.  Had the chicken chili and turkey pastrami sandwich.  Both very good.  Fries were so-so.  Decent value for downtown restaurant."}
{"text":"European way to close seating.  If I wanted to make new friends while eating, I'll go to a food kitchen."}
{"text":"Rating this as an \"American (new)\"/bar-grill sort of place, then definitely 5 stars.  Food: well-prepared, and good diversity on the menu without being \"and the kitchen sink.\" I liked that they had rotational items throughout the week, too (I think meatloaf was the night we went) along with chef specials. I went with the night's special of filet with crab, and it was very good.  They even have raw oysters, which were cleaned and prepared very nicely (it's funny, it always seems to me that the fancier seafood-focused places are where they leave them gritty, and places like this place just get them right).  Environment:  Cool vibe, energetic, and well-done lighting/decor.   Service: Special kudos on this front. The servers seemed to really know their stuff, had thoughtful explanations/recommendations, and were knowledgeable about the food they were serving. It appears that management here cares that their staff know what they're selling/serving, so this shows, and they seemed genuinely interested in our experience.  Tip: I'd recommend a reservation, even if you're just reading this and about to walk over from a local hotel. They were fairly busy, and we were a group of five. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table (no problem), but they did ask if we had a reservation when we arrived. But I also don't think it's a problem if you don't have one, just FYI for those that are able.  Opportunity for improvement: I really wish they'd list the abv on their beer listings! With more craft brews and focus on IPA-styles, some can start to get high, so it'd be nice to see at a glance to help plan if 2 or 3 is going to be too many for some.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our visit was with high anticipation. We love some of the other (Fox group) restaurants.  Our first impression was good as the place was busy and energetic.  We were greeted at the table with little urgency but the unique and popular entrees were described when our server learned it was our first visit.  We decided to try a cheese and meat starter which came to the table much too late.  The entrees were good but in our minds not a great value.   With high hopes in all we found our experience to be an average one."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with a large group coworkers. You would think having the word \"Arrogant\" in the name and the fact it's a steak house they would know how to cook a steak. Well you'd be wrong. Every single one of us that ordered steak received it overcooked. I ordered mine medium and was served leather on a plate. We made management aware of this yet when the bills came we all were charged full price. Which was about $70 per person. After my friend went up to the manager to fight for my bill, because I had only 1 bite of steak and the rest sat on my plate, were we all given a 50% discount. I will not dine here again. With all the choices in Phoenix, I say skip this place."}
{"text":"For our second visit to the Arrogant Butcher, the place was hopping ... We were seated in the back, where it was much quieter than our previous visit where we were seated in the room closest to the front door. We had different items from the menu. This time for a starter, I had beet salad, which I loved! My husband had deviled eggs with prosciutto which were delicious! For our entree, we both had the smoked chicken Waldorf salad. I must say I was a bit disappointed with the dish. If everything about this dish was tradional, I would have been a happy camper, but in my opinion, there was too much vinegar in the salad, which left me missing the sweetness of the grapes and apples, as well as the nuttiness of the walnuts! Nor could I taste the smokiness of the chicken.As a matter fact I don't think tradional Waldorf salad has vinegar in the dressing at all! The But our dessert of the  salted caramel pudding redeemed my disappointment of the smoked chicken Waldorf salad. It was a large helping that we shared, topped with whipped cream and we both loved it!! I look forward to coming back to explore the rest of the menu..."}
{"text":"Very packed, parking can be a hastle if a game night. Great food, a bit over priced however, if on not worrying about money, then this is a great place. When weather is nice outside seating is a must."}
{"text":"Not for the health conscious  They take reservations, which is great, because you'd be waiting a long, long time for a table before a concert or game otherwise.  There really are no healthy options here whatsoever, unless you go for the raw bar.  Service was fine.  Food was overpriced and again, really unhealthy.  Don't park underneath the building at Cityscape--it is a nightmare to get out of there--have to essentially walk down the street, through a hotel, up an elevator and down a bunch of stairs.  Super frustrating.  Pay for parking yourself (somewhere else).  It's better than being comped for parking that ruins your evening.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I promised my boyfriend I would start this review out with the truth.... So get this, we are in our way to the \"yelp party\" in downtown Phoenix. Halfway there I'm all \"Sooo what exactly did I say? Did I tell you it was tonight? Oooor\" and he looks at me with that what did you do face. \"Wellllllll, it's next week. Next Saturday. The 15th. No, the 17th. Wait Thursday. Yeh it's next Thursday\" So that's how that went and he was adamant that I should tell the yelp community I made a booboo. So Thursday he slept thru our date night, no big deal. We are on our way and I have a list or restaurants in downtown I want to go to cause I never go there. Arrogant butcher, done, no game right now, perfect.  Park, with harassment from a homeless man who saved me five dollars then asked for the five dollars he just saved me. Get a seat outside immediately. We were greeted by Pauliee. So we've had some weird waiters recently. Not this guy. Please give him to us each time. We ordered the pretzels and fondue. Even the boy I spoke of fondly earlier, who dislikes cheese, agreed that this was good! Too big for two people though, I wish they would cut it down and charge less.  Let me mention here...I love lemonade. But like the homemade sort. There is nothing I despise more than that drink minute maid tries to pass of as lemonade when it's really just a piss colored drink that tastes like nickels have been dropped in it with a squeeze of lemon. This lemonade was wonderfully homemade. And I got a refill. I died when he brought me a refill (not actually thank god). I was rationing myself then realized that and started guzzling.  Anyhow. They were out of the fried chicken. So sad. Which they didn't plan but good marketing because I will be back for it. I ordered the short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg and what I think was green chile or jalapeño cornbread. It was all sooo good. Lift up the cornbread, it weighs 10 pounds. I took home the leftovers and had enough for two more meals. Part fault of those pretzels. Man friend ordered steak over the succotash. It came sliced, unusual but great. He didn't want the horseradish. How is he my boyfriend? That would have made it so good.  A+++ on food, drinks and service. Pauliee if you ever read this, I hope that's your name...I'm sorry we were weird and talked to you about things you definitely didn't care about. But thanks for seeming genuinely interest haha, we rarely get such good waitstaff. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food is great if you know what to order and the staff is absolutely amazing. The staff is informative, kind and attentive. The oysters and the jambalaya are my favorites... make sure to get here a tad bit earlier if you want to find parking... I come here once every two weeks."}
{"text":"Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking \"who gets ...\"  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group \"guys\" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with 2 or 3 others."}
{"text":"I went here just before dinner time and it was really good food and service. The only reason I give it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because the entrée menu was completely unavailable until 5pm.  We shared three different appetizers, two of which were on the happy hour menu.  We got the crispy shrimp, pretzels with cheese, and nachos (the latter two being on the happy hour menu) to share - all very good. Finally, they honored our discount that we got from signing up for Fox Concepts emails.  Overall, a great place that I'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The good: food is decent. Good location to downtown events. Nice patio. The bad: The quality of service leaves something to be desired. It is slow and sometimes non-existstant. Some of the servers should be more friendly and take more enjoyment in their jobs. Overall, this place is okay. Will definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was pretty good. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and chips and it was solid. Nothing that overly wowed me. The chips had a good flavor... just a little overdone. Service was good but the refill on ice tea was slow. No biggie, I wasn't dying of thirst.  I was torn and almost gave it 4 stars, but overall it was just A-OK. That said, I will return.  URG! Edit to up it to a 4 star review. I just couldn't leave it at a 3. It deserves a 4. For real. Bad Cookie."}
{"text":"hostess (J)  did a super job , I made a reservation but she couldn't find it , she was very professional and took care of me . Allie the server was 1st rate ,  attentive but not intrusive , she helped me pick some wine , it was an upsell but it was well worth it . Food fab , ribs spot on . A shout out to Dave the salad man and a chill to Nic . Big fan . JZ still king of the line ."}
{"text":"Service on a sat night was slow but the oysters were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Our server Amanda was awesome with her suggestions and service! Would go here again in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Had exceptionally great takeout from here the other night! Parking was very convient and made takeout a breeze! That is usually the problem witb dinning downtwn, but they have this part down! will definatly order again!"}
{"text":"My problem is with the service. We had a party of 5 including my son who is 2 1/2. The waitress came and we ordered water for everyone, plus I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir (all other adults also ordered mixed drinks). I didn't order a specific one and the waitress didn't offer a specific one. First problem, she brought 4 waters. She did not bring my son a water. I had to ask her again to bring him a water. Second, when the bill came, oddly named item with a charge of $15. We discovered it was my glass of wine. She supposedly brought me the most expensive one on the menu. When asked if that was the cheapest glass if Pinor Noir on the menu, she said yes. It was not, there was an $8 glass. I would probably come again if I were in the area because the food is good, but I would definitely hope to not have the same server."}
{"text":"Smoked salmon rillete accidentally delivered to us, we ate it cause we thought it was a free (like chips n salsa) to hold us over. Oopsie, it wasn't.  No biggie, no charge. But man o man. It Was fantastic. My mai tai was so beautifully created too by the young male brown, wavy haired bartender.  Who i must say is outstanding at customer service and well rounded. He will go far in any service business. Wish he worked for my business"}
{"text":"Overpriced food for small portions. The good is ok not worth the money. The ham and cheese is good. After we left we were hungry that we went to Carl's junior. Terrible never again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy great service and delicious food this restaurant will not disappoint! I tried the chicken stuffed crab and it was delicious! The overall experience was pretty impressive! Looking forward to trying another dish soon."}
{"text":"The butcher deserves to be a little bit arrogant - the food, atmosphere, and waitstaff are all great! As mentioned before, beef short rib stew is to die for. Super meaty with good balance from the egg and cornbread. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, be sure to save room for dessert. The peanut butter chocolate pudding is like they melted 7 peanut butter cups and whipped it until it is a lighter version of itself. Waitstaff was also super friendly. Lastly, oh my do they pour a strong drink!"}
{"text":"We love food and it is evident on both of our recent visits that the chef at Arrogant Butcher not only also loves food, but respects it, curates it and most important, is consistent with it.  If you are \"into\" food and having a great experience you most likely will find that here.  If you want to put on your feedbag you may not appreciate what this gem has to offer and may, possibly, complain about what you get for your bucks. You are not the droids we are looking for. Move along.  Both visits we delighted in the oysters. Fresh, shucked perfectly, no grit and just the right amount of brine. It would be a crime to overlook these. Sip them. Savor them with the cilantro sauce.  The starters with cocktails are served like tapas. Golden beets, chilled. Generous roasted garlic in oil with crusty bread. The only addition needed on the garlic was salt. Uncomplicated and delicious deviled eggs. The mule we had is is an excellent cocktail. The servers are menu experts on both visits and make excellent beer recommendations.  Visit one we had the sea bass and the beet salad. Our dining partners ordered the pretzel appetizer as a meal. The portions were enough without going overboard. We all were well fed.  Second visit the short rib green chili for both of us. Fried egg white perfect with runny yoke. Absolutely perfect. Seasoned just right. Unique. Warm. Satisfying. Served with a corn muffin crispy and sweet in some places with pockets of butter and pops of green chili. Utterly delightful.  Desert was the salted caramel pudding and the chocolate cake. Both served in half size mason jars and topped with real cream, whipped. Rich flavors, deep and sweet without being cloying. Excellent dark, rich decaf coffee. Exactly what dessert should be.  Service consistently excellent with knowledgeable waitstaff. We were never rushed. Parking was validated. Great experience both times. A new Phoenix favorite for us."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to Tucson and we were very pleasantly surprised. This place has a unique interior that is spacious and inviting. I had a burger which was really great with a side salad also super good!  If you are in downtown Phoenix for any reason you would not be disappointed by a meal here."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is their happy hour. The cheese fondue is only $5 compared to the usual $10. They also have great drinks for $4. My friends usually like to get the shot of Irish Whiskey (which was Jameson) and a 12oz Kilt Lifter for $7 total.   They also have yummy little toasts for $4. I haven't tried that much of anything else here because after happy hour it gets a bit expensive. If you sign up for Fox Restaurant Concepts email list they will send you a $10 off coupon for one of their restaurants. My friend did it and got one for Arrogant Butcher so that helped with the price of food."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! The perfect place to stop before or after a game. They have a large variety of options to suit any appetite and their employees were nice and attentive. They also have a full bar with plenty of seating for you and your friends. They only negative we had was that most of our meals were on the salty side. Food portions were just right. Even for being a very busy lunch time it was a pleasurable. Can't wait to try The Arrogant Butcher for dinner."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch while in town for a conference. A co-worker and I sat at the Chef's Counter and ordered a quick sandwich and lemonade. Both were excellent. The staff were busy, so service was a smidge slow, but it was the lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"We just went for drinks and snacks.  Wonderful happy hour choices and the zucchini fritters were so yummy and fluffy."}
{"text":"Love it. Love the fondue. I haven't had anything here I don't like. The service is great too."}
{"text":"Amazing in every sense. Make a reservation before you go as they were really busy.   I had the meatloaf with puréed potatoes. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Elecka was our server at the Arrogant Butcher for lunch! What a delight! Very knowledgeable with the menu and food was amazing. It was our first time here and from the host stand to management, dining was superb! Suggest the Butcher's platter and ribs. Amazing time!!! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came for the first time for a friends's bachelorette party and I'm slightly disappointed. I've heard nothing but good things about arrogant, but as of right now I don't really see what the hype is about. Spent 9$ on a drink (the pink drink) that could have fit in a shot glass. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, didn't even seem like it had alcohol it it. And too top it all off there is a total of ONE vegetarian entree. I get that they're called the arrogant butcher, but come on... At least I can say the service was good."}
{"text":"My boss and I were out in Phoenix on a business trip and stumbled upon the Arrogant Butcher while looking for a place to eat. It was during Phoenix's restaurant week, so it was perfect timing. The place was very busy, but they were able to immediately seat us - awesome!   I ordered off the Prix Fixe menu and got the following: artichoke hummus (amazingness), beef short rib stew (heaven in a bowl - great mix of spicy bold flavors), and blueberry cheesecake (excellent - the buttery graham cracker streusel is out of this world!!!). I went in with no expectations and was blown away by my dinner. The flavors in each dish were simply perfect. Service was good; our waiter was very friendly and the food came in a timely manner. This place is a must try! I am sure I will be visiting the Arrogant Butcher on my next trip back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"so good I went there twice. Dinner was tasty. Fish tacos had generous portions of cod, with a good grill on them. Margarita was good with fresh lime, no fake sweet and sour. Salted caramel pudding was excellent. I'm a huge crème brulee fan, and the pudding was nice and thick and reminded of the crème part without the brulee. :)  Lunch the next day. had the smoke cubana sandwich which was just about the best sandwich I've ever had. Just awesome!  Another winner for Fox Restaurants."}
{"text":"WOW!!  This place was was pretty incredible.. I really don't understand how anyone could give them a poor review.. Honestly, the food was so good I could overlook any poor service.. The servers weren't  terribly frienly and chatty, but in all fairness they were sooo busy and were literraly sprinting around (probably working real hard to make sure they didn't get a poor yelp review for slow service ;/  ) My husband ànd I were in Phoenix for à few days for a convention ànd came here because it was highly recommended by someone who lived here for a couple of years.  We ordered: 1.  carnitas nacho, (my husband and i both agreed it was the most delicious nacho we have ever tasted, no exaggeration. 2.  chopped beet salad (so fresh and tangy and yummy) 3.  the short rib stew.. with the most amazing cornbread I have ever tasted. I enjoyed the stew (the shortrib was  small pieces and sparse. but the cornbread... I would fly out to Phoenix from San Francisco just for the cornbread! And I'm not a huge cornbread fan..  We ended going back a couple more times because we really found it so good!"}
{"text":"The name is what the are, we put our name in 1.5 hour wait, they sent us a text, we were at another bar we sprinted and were two minutes late, no go had to wait again, they are abusive and disrespectful this place is a S hole, I wouldn't waste a penny at this dump"}
{"text":"Average experience during restaurant week.  We had a 6:15pm reservation.  The place was packed - cool crowd and fun atmosphere.  All four in our party ordered off the restaurant week fixed menu.  We were all very satisfied with our orders, particularly the crab stuffed chicken and the caramel pudding. We were less than happy with the constant questioning  to order more drinks, the desserts came out before we were all finished with our entrees, the check came out before we started eating dessert, and the coffee was little more than colored water."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and great service. Went here Saturday night and had the prime rib with potatoes. It was the best tasting prime rib I've ever had. I love coming back here. Never dissapoints"}
{"text":"The food is great and the drinks are delicious. Also, make sure to get Andrew as your waiter, he's great!"}
{"text":"uummm not so much. The appetizers were the best part, and yes, agree with other's reviews, pretzel fondue excellent. The muscles were also delicious. The most disappoint part was the Sea Bass- would have made a better door stop. Over cooked, dark and flavorless. My friend also ordered, her's cooked the same. I was part of a large group and the service was perfect so kudos to the staff!"}
{"text":"Date of visit: 03/14/11  (I joined YELP just to write a review for this place!)  OMG... I love this place. The food was great. Just what you would expect from a FOX restaurant. Being downtown is a big plus.   The staff was helpful and Lauren was a great server. Ask for her when you go in.   The Kitchen staff was great. This was my second time at The Arrogant Butcher, so I decided to sit at the salad bar to watch the kitchen staff at work( Lauren was not in, but Chip was great too)...  Sitting at the bar you really get to see the workings of a kitchen. Watching the slicer for our charcuterie in action was really awesome, made by Chef Austin. Our food came out in a timely manner, and was perfect.   But what I really want to talk about is the desserts.   I ordered a Peanut Butter Cup, it was amazing. I watched as it was made by Chef Ricardo, he was really quick and knew what he was doing. So, I decided to try the other desserts. I noticed they had replaced the Apple Fritters with a Salted Caramel Pudding. I liked the apple fritters, but this new dessert is even better.  The caramel pudding is heaven in a glass jar( the idea is very inventive, I love it) Also the Blueberry cheesecake is really good as is the warm chocolate cake with caramel(my favorite mix), and they all come in the nifty cute jars.  Chef Ricardo was very helpful as I spoke to him about the desserts. He said when he is not here he is usually hiding in the back baking something. He stated it was a team effort and he loves his team in the pastry department and the rest of the kitchen.     I highly recommend The Arrogant Butcher,especially for desserts. And if you can, sit at the salad bar and watch them at work. Ricardo is hidden by the beautiful black slicer."}
{"text":"we ordered the oysters and a burger. the oysters were fresh and tasted great! the burger was forgettable. excellent service and an overall good vibe. if i was in the downtown area, i would go back and give something else a try."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I went to eat there on a Thursday night. The price of the entrees seemed a bit high but we thought maybe the portion sizes would be relevant. First our drinks took 20 minutes to arrive. My friend ordered the Salmon for $24. The serving size seemed less then 6 oz and the fish was over cooked and dry. I ordered a green goddess salad for $9 that claimed to have snap peas, asparagus, and peppers. When it arrived the bowl only had a large handful of lettuce. There was one snap pea and one piece of asparagus and no peppers. I was extremely disappointed. My husband and I eat downtown quite often,however I've made it clear we won't be visiting this establishment again. It's a shame because we love having a variety of choices."}
{"text":"Apple Bees or TGIF level!  Not impressed.  They get away charging their prices because of Fox Concepts; but they really are just another TGI-Fridays and Apple Bee's.  The services was okay, but the girl had too many tables and was doing her best to smile.  She was amazing.   The hosts are lazy.  The girl stood around staring at us and I had to ask her to seat us.  The food was made with no love.    I could have had a better time, spending half the money at Apple Bees.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"Went to grab a bit to eat after seeing a Saturday ballet matinee. It was happy hour so I got \"The Fix,\" which wasn't too bad, but the beer I got after that (Sweaty Betty) was better. Food was pretty average, although the pretzel fondue was really tasty. I got three shrimp which were pricey ($3/shrimp) but pretty large and the tabbouleh salad which wasn't like tabbouleh at all (but still tasty). Overall, good service, tasty food but overpriced."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, our server was knowledgeable and the dessert was amazing. The only issue was that all of the taps were warm so they only had cans and a more limited selection."}
{"text":"Very energetic atmosphere  awesome decor. Had the brie with cherry marmalade and the crispy shrimp for appetizers.  The shishito peppers with the shrimp were my fave.  Seabass was to die for!  A definite must and truly enjoyed my first meal in Phoenix"}
{"text":"We tried Arrogant Butcher for the first time on Saturday for Happy Hour. There was a 30 minute wait which was reasonable considering the activity downtown.  The hostess seated us and was pleasant. We were greeted immediately by our waitress. She took our drink order and explained the menu.  I thought the cocktails were priced good for Happy Hour. I had the Turkey Pastrami sandwich and my wife had the beet salad. I thought the sandwich was cooked perfectly and the fries were hot and crispy. My wife enjoyed the salad but commented that the bowl was too deep and the nuts and dressed stayed on the bottom. We felt the price was right and the atmosphere was great. We look forward to trying other options from the menu."}
{"text":"I went to The Arrogant Butcher for a birthday dinner on Saturday night. We were a group of about 25 and sat in the back room at 3 different tables. The server we had was very insistent we all stay in our seats if we wanted separate checks, which is understandable. However, later in the meal we were co-mingling...it was a party, after all. Our server was visibly annoyed and he even said, \"This is disastrous. I'm so mixed up right now.\" I'm a server, and even if that's how he was feeling, he could have been a little more positive about the whole thing. We all spent a lot of money and tipped 20%, so it's only common sense that you would be cordial and nice to your guests. Besides that, he also just had an arrogant, if you will, attitude. I asked before ordering if the Bolognese was beef or pork. He replied, \"Bolognese is always a mixture of both,\" and just stared at me when I cheerily replied with an \"Ok, thank you!\"  That being said, the other server (I think his asstistant), was great. She promptly refilled drinks and smiled. The food was great. We had the Rock Shrimp appetizer and Sea Salt Chips, which were very yummy and served with great sauces. For dinner I had the Crab Cake Louie salad and my husband had the Jambalaya....both were delicious, as was the Chocolate Souffle.  I would eat here again, but I'm not sure I would choose it for a large group meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Fun atmosphere. Good food. Good location if you're headed to arena or baseball game."}
{"text":"Incredible food, fun location and great drinks! A bit pricey for my taste but lovely for a night out."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to get a last minute reservation on Valentines Day. Our experience started off with our incredible server-wish I could remember his name! He was knowledgable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on to each of our tastes.  We started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!  For my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside.   We finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well."}
{"text":"The family and I went there a few months ago.I loved the atmosphere and the food. The server was a little rude, but nothing too bad.   The star of the night was the Bolognese, it was one of the best things I've eaten at a restaurant. There just isn't enough to say about how good it was.   Although, at the time of this writing, I have heard that the Bolognese is no longer on the menu. There are other great things on the menu, but if the Bolognese is no longer on the menu, I have no reason to go back.   Please bring the Bolognese back!  R.I.P. Bolognese"}
{"text":"After weeks of going back and forth, back and forth and checking tons of reviews, we decided to go check out the Arrogant Butcher ourselves. The reviews on here (Yelp!) were kinda all over the place so we weren't sure what to expect. Any-who, we came to the conclusion that:   1. The decor is pretty darn awesome.  2. The waitstaff was good. The place was fully staffed and timing on everything was good.  3. Reservations may not be such a bad idea. We made one at six and it was pretty dead in there when we arrived. However, by the time we left around 7:15, it was full. We went on a Saturday (no games of any sort going on downtown either).  4. WAY overpriced. Our breakdown: 3 cocktails, an appetizer, 3 mussels...$1 a pop, an entree (we split it) and 2 desserts = $100 without tip.  5. Filet was not worth it. At $29 bucks, you would expect something much more. It was overcooked and while the menu made it sound like it came with potatoes, it was more or less a small amount of pureed/creamed potatoes.  6. Drinks, appetizers and desserts were all awesome.     Final thought: We will be back....but for drinks and appetizers during happy hour which runs from 3-6 Mon-Sat (they are closed Sundays)."}
{"text":"Randomly went here for lunch while downtown Phoenix on a Saturday.  When we walked in at 2:00pm, the main dining room was practically empty, but the hostess asked \"Do you have a reservation?\" -- obviously I replied \"No.\"  Instead of walking us 10 feet to the side to seat us at one of the many empty window-side tables with a view, the hostess took us down a series of hallways and lead us to a windowless room in the far back full of creepy photos of children and John McCain covering the walls.   The overpriced cheese and meat appetizer was good.  My girlfriend's stew was okay (nothing special, pretty equal to Campbell's $3 chunky stew).  THOUGH, my $24 crab stuffed chicken is the main reason we'll probably never go back to this place if we're in Phoenix -- it had zero seasoning, and was served over a small bed of lightly seasoned spinach leaves.  The chicken tasted like cardboard and the crab tasted like it was dumped out from a can and heated in a microwave...  I'm not one of those snooty yelp snobs as this review may paint me to be, BUT if I'm paying you $24 for my entree, it better have some flavor (I could have walked outside and dined on some bushes and dirt for free -- would have been the same).  If you want to be shoved in a storage closet and fed wood-chips, this is the place for you.  If not, I don't know, try McDonalds, at least you get what you pay for there.   p.s. Our overly-tattooed (obviously to cover up lack of personality) waitress DID offer to get me another entree since mine was like eating a sandal -- so there was an effort there, so... they've got that going for them..?"}
{"text":"In town for the night and on a recommendation ended up here. Had a great time. Our server was very helpful in offering suggestions and everything we had we thoroughly enjoyed. The atmosphere was relaxing and will definitely come back again when in town."}
{"text":"Immediately this place felt like one of the Fox restaurants.(And I haven't been in Phoenix for over a year!) Which isn't necessarily bad - it just ends up making me feel like I have been strategically targeted through focused research groups and lulled into believing this experience is unique.    The downtown area definitely needs a place like that, and Fox has a a knack for creating successful places.  I wasn't surprised to read up on it and see that it was one of the clan.  I had already eaten by the time I met up with the group there, so I was happy they decided to do a variety of appetizers.  We ordered the Pretzel Fondue, Potato Fritters, Mussels, and Rock Shrimp.    The Pretzel Fondue and the Potato Fritters were definitely worth every minute I would have to spend at the gym the next day.  The Mussels were tasteless and the Shrimp was just a little greasy.  Their cocktails are pretty creative and are a modern twist on some oldies:  The old  fashioned was good, but my favorite was the Rhubarb Collins.  Our waiter was great.  He was attentive and fun with our medium sized group.  You could tell he enjoyed his job - and loved the food.  It was so much fun to ask him about the various dishes, and listen to him describe every texture, taste and ingredient in each.  Sadly, his description of the rock shrimp was better than the real thing.  My rating is really a reflection on the \"not really a chain\" chain restaurant concept.  Admittedly, the place is cool, the menu is fun and interesting and a gem in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I must admit I'm very shocked now to see the four stars for this restaurant after dining there lastnight. For a FRC it's extremely disappointing. Two out of the four dishes were bland and underwhelming. The crab stuffed chicken although packed with a good amount of crab was nothing to rave about. Chicken was breaded with no flavor. The chicken stroganoff although fresh pasta fell short on any favor profiling and extremely bland. The best dishes were the short rib green chile stew..this was delicious!! I was glad my sister-in-law shared some of hers with us.  The carnitas were also delicious and these two dishes are one of the cheaper meals it on the menu. If you do go, definitely stick with short rib stew or carnitas. Our server was wonderful and the drinks are stiff and that was a definite plus. Other than that, I will not be back for the food regardless how delicious the other two dishes were. Just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the right crowd. I wasn't sure what I would find, but this place is a must do in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Hey Everyone.....had dinner there last night, 2/26.  LOVED IT..  The restaurant itself, very downtown urban modern, clean, bathrooms were spotless at the time of my visit.  Reading other reviews there were several mentions of the Pretzels w/ the Fondue.  C'mon...pretzels and cheese, what's not to love.  This appetizer didn't disappoint, pretzels were hot and fresh, didn't have that 'just thawed' taste, the cheese sauce AWESOME!   We also had the white shrimp from the raw bar.  At $3 dollars a piece i thought was a little pricey, with that said they were terrific.  HUGE, plump and fresh, the taste was truly great.  My only bad thing to say about the shrimp was the 'shell on', had i thought to ask i would have asked that they peel the shrimp before brining it out.  It's a personal pet peeve of mine of having to take the shells off shrimp.  For out main meal we shared the Saturday night special which was baby back ribs and the grilled swordfish.  The swordfish was served with some kind of barely side dish, VERY good, the fish was terrific, would definitely get this again.  We were split on baby back ribs. They had a heavy char on them, which i loved my friend wasn't crazy about them but said they had a good flavor.  The meat literally fell off the both with almost no effort at all.  The service was very very good, our server Steph M, was very attentive w/o being intrusive, which can sometimes be a fine line.  Our drinks were NEVER empty, which is HUGE, we tend to drink a lot of iced tea while we eat.  On a side note, they have signs pointing for parking for the restaurant.  A sign at the exit of the elevators would be a great help.    Can't wait to go back.....i hope this place makes it!  Ciao everyone!"}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp when we landed and tried the charcuterie. Was excellent! Service was professional and knowledgeable as well. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Omg I love their iceberg wedge but I get it with chicken instead of the short rib. Somedays I crave this salad it is so tasty. You defiantly want to make reservations if you are short on time because they are always busy but you will not regret going here. I really enjoyed their hamburger also but my favorite is the wedge salad. Servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I really like the atmosphere and food.  The filet mignon was superb, the waiter also didn't bat an eye when my girlfriend ordered hers well done (although it destroys the meat).  The only really big problem was our reservation which was for 2030 was delayed for twenty minutes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the fish and chips, halibut I think.  And, an order of the crusty bread is a must.  I hope downtown keeps building.  Some of these new restaurants are terrific."}
{"text":"Charcuterie plate was awesome, and dinner was just as good, with a lively ambience, would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch after a day of travel. The customer service that we experienced from the front door to the server was phenomenal; you can tell it is clearly part of the culture and expectation of the restaurant. The server did a great job explaining the menu and suggesting some popular choices and personal favorites. Her suggestions were on point. The pretzels and provolone fondue was an excellent appetizer, the pretzels are made fresh and on site daily. By far the best I have ever tasted. The sweet potato tortellini was the servers personal suggestion and it was the absolute best pasta I have ever had; unique and different taste but absolutely on point. I wish we had an establishment like this back at home. Kudos to the management and ownership."}
{"text":"We saw great reviews on Yelp and decided to try. And we were disappointed. My husband and I had oysters with white shrimp both were not fresh. We also tried fillet mignon and he was with bad sauce and too salty. What about service - it was slow. Our waiter forgot how we ordered  our meat and it was overcooked."}
{"text":"From a food perspective this would rank very high. The only reason I knocked my rating down slightly was the timeliness of things getting to the table seemed lengthier than it should've been- particularly appetizers and drinks. Otherwise the experience was great."}
{"text":"Very good burger. Cubano sandwich as well. Service was great at the bar. Friendly. Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"This is the place to go before seeing a show at Stand Up Live. It was Thursday night and this place was PACKED. We had to sit at the kitchen bar, which were probably the best seats in the house.  The salad chef was social, explaining the difference in meats and cheeses on the menu, while still running his station effortlessly. We even got a little taste taste of one of the items. We ended up ordering all sorts of things we probably would have never tried if not for him (salad chef).  Our actual waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  So much in fact, I let him surprise me with my entree.  He chose a lovely sea bass, cooked perfectly. Absolute heaven. We we on a flavor high, so naturally we had to try dessert.  Salted caramel pudding with sliced apples, OMG. Somebody roll me out the door.... Just go there...with people who like to share....."}
{"text":"Not really a fan, the menu does not offer a lot of variety I went for dinner but I ended up just getting pretzel bites and cheese because none of the meals looked appetizing. Service was good A little pricey for the size of the portions you are served."}
{"text":"We showed up early (5ish) so we could make it to a concert after dinner.  We sat at the bar and had happy hour (pretzel, ok but salty, shrimp, yum).  The 4 dollar Mule coctail was incredible and very strong for the price.  The salted caramel pudding is a must."}
{"text":"The beef short rib stew was amazing. What was even better...my waiter Tony. I want this guy to be my BFF! He is great at what he does and I would come back just for his great customer service!"}
{"text":"The first time we went to Arrogant Butcher we sat at the bar.. We went in the middle of the week so it wasn't as busy. The food was good - but not great.  The second time we decided to go was on Friday night.. The place was packed (and good for them). The service was spot on but I cant say the same for the food. The food was  average nothing memorable about any of it..   At the end we spent 150.00 for the 2 of us. The food is not worth that price.  Also, they seem to skimp on the wine by the glass and spirit pours.. I so want to love this place.. but 2 x now and it still didn't delight."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. Went there for a party and we were treated like dirt. We came in all dressed up, and weren't given the time of day. I asked for a Coors draft and was told to go to the Tilted Kilt. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you like being treated like a third class citizen."}
{"text":"The Fox Restaurant folks know how to run restaurants.  They are all similar versions of one another, each with it's own twist on various cuisines.  We've only dined there once as we don't normally travel downtown just to dine out, but the food was excellent, service was great, and the atmosphere was very welcoming.  It has to be nearly perfect for me to give 5 stars so this 4 star rating is as good as it gets for most really good restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is great.   My husband and I came here yesterday for dinner while our girls were at an event nearby.   We sat at the chefs table.  We were given friendly efficient service.  Food was excellent.  We were given some free pretzel rolls with cheese dip on the house because they had extra orders.  Atmosphere was fantastic.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Once you get over the name, which took me a loop at first. Good restaurant. I'd say its trying to a hip spot, but should just stay as a restaurant. The service was good. The bar was a bit uncomfortable; not sure if its the aluminum bar table or the uncomfortable stools, but hey the food was great, so can't complain, plus if all else fails..its beneath \"Tilted Kilt\". lol"}
{"text":"Location is convenient. Food is alright. Drinks could improve. No bad experiences, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"There were 10 of us there to celebrate two birthdays in the family.  Reservations were made in advance and they seated us in a private room, which was great!  Service and food were both excellent and they very ably and graciously accommodated my special dietary needs.  I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic on both occasions that I ate here. First time I stopped for lunch and ordered a salad that was very good. It had fruit inside of it along with feta cheese and the flavors were near perfect. The second time I ordered a couple appetizers, pretzel bites the cheese was delicious and fried zucchini that was prepared completely different then the average slice bread and fry. The prime rib was cooked exactly as I requested (med well) and was very tender and juicy. Again everything tasted great! It is more on the expensive side so don't show up on a budget."}
{"text":"Updating my review because the management staff of Arrogant Butcher reached out and apologized, and did so in an extremely professional way.  Way to be attentive and responsive to your clients' feedback.  Hope to return at some point to give it another shot, hopefully the experience will be superior to the last."}
{"text":"First tip, make reservations! We came on a busy night in Phoenix with games in both arenas and a variety of shows, but made reservations and were sat within minutes of arriving.  Portions are not huge (more than enough to fill you up though) , and quality is amazing!  Service was very helpful and friendly.  Great place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bud light. No locals allowed. Well maybe the VIP. This is not who we want in Phoenix. This is not what we've been fighting for."}
{"text":"Walking into Arrogant Butcher will instantly increase your swank level by at least 25.6%, seriously.   This modern chophouse by Sam Fox puts a sexy spin on nouveau-nostalgic, and trendy flair on classic American fare in typical Fox fashion. Plus it's located in the heart of downtown Phoenix which is on the verge of a full blown revival, and right on the lightrail which makes it terribly convenient for anyone who lives in the area.   The handcrafted cocktails were quite impressive. I'm all over house made mixers,  vintage spirits, and super fresh ingredients that translate into something really sublime in every sip. Don't miss the bourbon infused 'Candlestick Maker', and if you're in the mood for something sensational and eclectic look no further than the heavenly gin and chartreuse laced cocktail dubbed 'The Last Word'. Indeed.  For the soft-opening we attended the service was spot on, actually more like exceptional. And the food they served up followed closely behind. We sampled the mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder with pomme frites (that's fancy for french fries), crab stuffed chicken, skirt steak and grilled swordfish with artichokes hearts.  Although slightly salty, and somewhat expected... it was still  flavorful,  delicious, and very satisfying.   Yes, Fox is a somewhat of local restaurant giant and Arrogant Butcher does have a decidedly chain vibe to it. But why so serious, downtown/midtown/cenpho elitist diner? It's a chain vibe in the best sense of the term. It really was an overall a fantastic and festive experience! Definitely joining the ranks of lively new downtown establishments I plan to frequent often.   Look for me at the bar, cocktail in hand, swag in full effect. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"Very good. Cool atmosphere. The jambalaya was the best ever. And we are food snobs! Service was great too. Busy on a Friday around happy hour time."}
{"text":"We went in for a drink and dessert. The service was pretty good but the chocolate cake dessert was so so. We will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Nice vibe. Artichoke Hummus was off the chain. I also recommend the Sweet Potato Torteli."}
{"text":"When I stayed at the Palomar next door, I thought that this looked like a decent option for dinner; after driving up from Tucson and fighting Friday afternoon rush-hour traffic, I didn't necessarily want to venture too far. And it is a decent option... the restaurant is very pretty and has a great energy. The food: it's OK. I was disappointed in the shrimp  appetizer... it was quite ordinary. The burger was good, but not out of this world. About the only thing I'd definitely recommend is the peanut butter cup dessert. It was a custardy-mousse-y concoction that was satisfying without being too heavy.  I'd come here again, but I would try different things. The place is very popular."}
{"text":"Pretzels. Burgers. Salmon. Good drink list.  This is a staple for my wife and I.  Great service as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a drink and a quick bite but after the service I was receiving I decided to only order a drink (one more min of being ignored I would have walked out ordering nothing). I sat at the bar, which wasn't busy considering there was only 2 other people sitting there at the time,and the 2 bartenders were too busy talking to each other to check the area to see if new people were sitting down. After about 3 min of being ignored, another person sat down. Because this person sat closer to the bartenders peripheral , she got served within 1-2 min. Finally after the bartender took her order and was starting to prepare her drink she noticed me, By then the damage of waiting 5 min had been done. It is not for me to get their attention, it is for them to not have conversations with their backs fully turned to their station so they can notice if they have customers in need."}
{"text":"Amazing. The food is eclectic. The restaurant claims to be a steakhouse but they serve much, much more. Try anything from the \"raw\" menu, you won't be disappointed.  If possible ask for Chip, he is attentive and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. We had so many questions about the items and he was very helpful making suggestion and recommendations.  Very pleased with our visit! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and we loved it. Terrific happy hour menu. The pretzels with provolone fondue were amazing. The staff was really friendly and attentive. The bartenders made great drinks. The rest of their menu looks fantastic and we're looking forward to heading back."}
{"text":"Me and a couple of my friends did dinner here the other night and Im really glad we did, its great to see so many new and well run venues in the downtown area. We were on our way to a Suns game and decided to stop in for a bite.  I decided to do some \"carb loading\" and had the soft pretzels and provolone fondue and they were awesome the pretzels were nice and soft and the cheese was a perfect companion,  followed by the chicken stroganoff which was very nicely done and the sauce was just the right consistency not too thick and not too soupy. The service was very good and the downtown vibe is actually starting to feel like it is getting a pulse."}
{"text":"My favorite casual restaurant downtown. Food is unique and delicious. Service is great.Be sure to order the pretzel balls :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said \"we must go there for lunch one day\" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a \"higher end\" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!"}
{"text":"Went there last night before a concert. We ordered the smoked salmon and our friends had the pretzel bites as an appetizer. Both of the appetizers were really good. For dinner I had the Sea Bass and my boyfriend had steak. Not at all worth the price on either of those. I sent my seafood back and just ordered some french fries. My boyfriend said his steak was full of fat and not good at all. Overall atmosphere was good and the server was excellent. Manager took the sea bass off the bill and was very nice, but I wouldn't go back because the food just isn't  that great and definately not worth the money. All in all our bill was still $120 with drinks, appetizer and my boyfriends steak. I do not mind paying for good food, but if that's what you want, then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for brunch on Sunday with some friends before a show at the Herberger. First impression: the space is funky, cool and inviting, and the booths are really comfortable!   The menu reminded me of the menu at Culinary Dropout; American food with a twist! The brunch menu has few breakfast sandwiches, french toast, and some other egg dishes as well as some of the lunch menu. We started off with the Pretzels and Provolone Fondue....I have had it at Culinary Dropout, and it is just as good....warm and comforting. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to eat, but I ended up going with the bacon, egg, cheese and avocado breakfast sandwich...and YUM...I picked well! I have an issue with eggs lots of times, but these were perfect, made even more perfect by being covered in melted cheese, creamy avocado and crisp bacon on a soft, homemade roll. The breakfast potatoes that came on the side were a nice surprise (they weren't listed on the menu) and cooked until golden and crisp. I wish they offered this sandwich 7 days a week, because I would eat it for lunch or dinner anytime!   My friends had the egg white wrap (which she devoured), the French toast that was served with jelly and cream in the cutest little jar and the fruit salad which was mixed with yogurt. We all really enjoyed our food, and the fun cocktails too, I had The Pink Drink....and it was STRONG! The menu also has a cold bar of oysters, lobsters and many other delicious sounding items.   I think this is a cool place and the food is good, but I don't think I would go if I wasn't already going to be downtown for another event because you have to deal with parking in the garage and all that goes with it, and that is just something us AZ people are not fans of. But with that being said, I need to find something to do downtown so that I can visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Damn you Fox Restaurant Concepts! Damn you and your salted caramel pudding!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here numerous times since we live a few blocks away, and this is our favorite downtown date night. The service has been excellent every time. The waitstaff has been attentive and on point. We have never been disappointed by the food. Overall an excellent place."}
{"text":"Was here because I got a gift certificate from work. Food was okay... atmosphere was okay... but I really liked their plates! Haha..."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked down to lunch at the Arrogant Butcher recently and had a wonderful time. The restaurant is a really interesting concept focusing on two things: charcuterie plates and upscale junk food. As these are basically two of my favorite food concepts, I was sold.   We skipped the charcuterie plates because we wanted a more solid meal (but we were excited to see Benton's ham on the overall excellent-looking menu! Benton's is ham producer outside my wife's hometown. They also make the best bacon in the world). As such, we ordered the cheeseburger and the jambalaya.  My wife' jambalaya was very good, although as someone whose family originally comes from Cajun country, I didn't find it as good as the stuff I can get in Louisiana. That said, it was fresh and very tasty (also a huge portion). The burger initially bothered me: our server didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked and I was dismayed to find it arrive well done (I like burgers pretty rare). After a few bites, though, I realized that this dish is a riff on an In-n-Out burger (it's served with cheese, freshly made half-sour pickles, grilled onions, and a sweet, mayo-based sauce). If the idea of a wood-fired, up-market In-n-Out burger appeals to you (which it should), get this. After this observation, I noticed a lot of the items on their menu are similar riffs on classic junk food (for instance, we had the salted caramel pudding for dessert, which is basically the best butterscotch pudding ever). What's really cool about this concept at the Arrogant Butcher is that they're not screaming about how this is up-market junkfood and not being ironic about it (the burger isn't wrapped in wax paper, for instance). It's just solid, unpretentious, deeply tasty food that happens to be driven by flavors not normally seen in fine dining.  We did come during lunch, so I can't speak to people having problems getting seated or with service. Our server was especially excellent and very attentive.  Overall, a really good place to eat in downtown."}
{"text":"My daughter just moved to Phoenix and we were on the hunt for a nice, comfortable restaurant that we could sit outside with her dog.  We asked a few people for recommendations and everyone pointed us in the direction of The Arrogant Butcher.  We were not disappointed.  They are dog friendly and the food was great!  We split the Waldorf salad, ordered oysters and split the meatloaf special.  The salad was fresh and tasty, the oysters were sooooooo good!  They give you three sauces to choose from which made it interesting - all three were great.  The meatloaf served with beans and mashed potatoes were awesome.  The best thing is that they split the plates without us ever asking them (for an extra plate to do ourself).  I love it when you get a great waiter - ours was Brian - an Arizona native.  He was wonderful!  We did have drinks - I don't remember the names but their version of a Mojito was awesome!  It was a beautiful night and we really had a great time!  Oh - and desserts - we had the peanut butter and one of the chocolate ones (again - I don't remember the names) and they were really good too!!!!  When I come back to Phoenix to visit my daughter this will be a must.  I loved every aspect of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped into the Arrogant Butcher for happy hour / appetizers. The service was prompt, thorough and friendly, but maybe a little too friendly? Our server was nice, but he got too close to our faces when talking and was a little intense. I won't hold it against him or the restaurant....but it was sort of uncomfortable. The food was good. We had the pretzels  with provolone fondue (fabulous comfort snack and same as Culinary Dropout), oysters (there were just OK...I've had much better, but they weren't bad). We ordered the crispy rock shrimp off the Happy Hour menu, not bad, but nothing special. I will say the Happy Hour prices were a great deal, and the food was pretty good. I can't give more stars because nothing really stood out to me. I will say I loved the upscale, modern, clean decor and the fun ambiance. Lots of flat screen TV's in the bar area where we sat, so it's probably a great place to watch Monday Night Football.  I will be back for Happy Hour and possibly dinner."}
{"text":"Sat at the Bar, since we didn't want to wait for a table. The bar stools are horrible, hard, and almost feel unsafe to lean your back on. The bartender that served us was nice, but it was weird that she never gave us any eye contact when we ordered. After looking at the menu we decided we would just have drinks and share an appetizer. \"We had the pretzel fondue appetizer which was okay.\" While I didn't taste all the menu items, just felt like the food was overly priced, or maybe seafood is just alot more expensive in Phoenix. The biggest disappointment was when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and there was no soap in either dispensers. I mean isn't that a health code violation? In a place where they serve as much seafood as this place does, it was a bit disturbing that there was no soap. I mentioned this to the hostess as I was leaving, and she didn't seam to care. I wasn't impressed by this place."}
{"text":"The concierge at the Westin recommended this restaurant and given the few  restaurant choices in downtown Phoenix it was okay, but the menu was limited and the \"butcher\" name not indicative of what was on the menu. The kale salad was nice and the halibut slightly tough on the outside and come with little for the money  The drink menu was interesting and the outside seating pleasant."}
{"text":"Good place to eat, professional staff. Can be pricey though.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a Fox Concepts restaurant.  I'm not a regular per se, but I do have business lunches here on occasion.    It's smart to call ahead, otherwise you might be waiting some."}
{"text":"Had fish tacos which were really good.  We sat outside and the street noise and people out having a good time after the baseball game made it hard to talk but still a fun place"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Loved the hummus plate and chicken tabbouleh salad for lunch. Will come here whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came here totally by accident, intending to go to the Tilted Kilt that was up stairs. By the time we had realized our mistake, we had already been seated and the waiter had promptly taken our drink order so we decided to stay because we didn't want to be rude by walking out. We had never been here before, we had kids with us, and the menu isn't exactly tailored to a younger child's palate but, we found something that would be suitable for the kids and gave it a shot. Turned out to be the best mistake we ever made. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, everything was absolutely perfect.  My boyfriend is hard to win over and even he said over & over how impressed he was.  Especially with the service. They were friendly, professional,and  on top of EVERYTHING. Not once did we have an empty glass in front of us. It was all perfect."}
{"text":"Fabulous sushi at the amazing Stingray! Great music...indoor..outdoor dining...wonderful service. A great time for a Friday night celebration!!! It's Friday! Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Service was good, the food was great but the soft warm pretzels with provolone fondue as a starter are amazing, we enjoyed them so much that I now refer to the pretzels as \"life changing\". Mad love for the pretzels!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff was friendly.  I had the turkey sloppy joe which had possibly the most perfect bun I've ever eaten.  The pepper on top gave it a nice twist and the side salad was yum, not just an afterthought.  I want to come back and try the breads and cheese."}
{"text":"I really don't get all the hype this place gets, I was totally underwhelmed.  Very expensive and not very good.  I ordered a burger and the patty was so thin it looked like something that would come from McDonald's.  I have to admit the salted caramel desert was very good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"In a city where it's hard to find a combination of good food and service - this place nailed it! Our waitress was fantastic and didn't miss a beat. I order the ribs and they were the best I've had in a long while. My wife ordered the prime rib and it was equally ridiculous.  But forget all the food . . . the service here was top notch. From the bartender to the server . . . it was an exceptional experience.   I look forward to my next visit to The Arrogant Butcher.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good.  Being downtown I did not have high expectations but everything was good.  The fondue is a must!"}
{"text":"Mark Wilson was our server, all I can say is he is absolutely incredible! I am also in the industry, but I can truly say that this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Not only was the meal amazing, but the server is what made it that much more. He was so personable and described anything and everything on the menu that would have eaten anything he described. When you come here ask for him! I know we will be back just for Mark!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Was super crowded due to Garth Brooks concert but staff was very friendly always smiling, very attentive and great service. Food was delicious and hot. Staff worked very well together."}
{"text":"I ordered take out at around 630PM on a Tuesday. Take out only took 15 minutes. I walked in, was greeted swiftly by the hostess, went to the bar to pay for my order, and then walked safely back to my hotel--food in hand. I had ordered the beef short rib stew, which was neatly packed in a disposable container alongside a separate container for the cornbread. Nestled in the bag was also a package of disposable silverware.   1) I began with the stew: floating on top of the stew was the cooked egg. I decided not to eat this little dude separately so I mixed it up in the stew and ate it. Both the taste & aftertaste were rich in flavor & spicy--my lips are still pleasantly tingling from the spiciness. The consistency was also excellent: not too thick/thin (each bite was adequately contained on the spoon, without any dribbling). The ratio of meat to non-meat ingredients was adequate, too. I truly did not feel like I got ripped off for the price.   2) I then ate the cornbread: the immediate taste didn't prove much to me. But, after oh ~5seconds the flavor did kick in, and it was suave. I often ignore breads due to it being more or a hassle to chew & swallow which poses more of a health hazard than a pleasure to consume. This bread, however, was definitely in the latter category. Idk how to describe foods well, but it was rich, suave (again), perfectly buttery, and easily disintegrated in my mouth.   There was nothing else in the bag, which was expected.   Overall: yummy, and I would eat there again and get the same thing over again. My belly feels warm, and on a cold wintery night, this would definitely warm your belly & maybe even your heart a little. I'll attach a picture of the food, but it was s/p eating (bc it was yummy)."}
{"text":"Ehh...I won't be back. Trendy isn't always bad, but Arrogant Butcher exemplifies trendiness while sacrificing the food + experience factor. With a large group, I had the cioppino ($25--which I was sooo excited about) and a martini (about $9). It was fine. No major complaints. However, it just wasn't worth it.   I definitely splurge on food more than I should, but Arrogant Butcher just left me feeling disappointed. Not because of anything specific, but a general sense of ennui.   Your money can be put to better use elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We were \"greeted\" by a semi-rude gentleman and when we decided to sit on the patio seemed to dismiss us immediately.  Our waiter was friendly, but never came back to check on us after our drinks and appetizers were served.  We were soooo excited to try the fondue and onion dip, but were sorely disappointed in both!  The fondue was super salty and \"processed\" (like cheese you get in those school fundariser crocks), and the onion dip was a less than perfect rendition of Knorr soup mix.  Overall, great location, but probably won't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"So...the food was good and I'll definitely be back for that. But...the service!!! WTF? Where did this guy Patrick come from? I dunno...BUT I do know he is one of the best servers at Arrogant Butcher. I've been here a half dozen times. Patrick's attentiveness, timeliness, knowledge of the beer and food menus and friendliness was top notch. I'd carry on but I don't have that much time and I doubt you want to read it. Look, go eat and drink here and when you do, ask to sit in Patrick's section. It'll be worth it. Thanks for the great memorable service, Patrick."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. Our waiter, Ian, was exceptional.  He clearly knew the menu, cared about the quality of food, and made fantastic recommendations. Some unique items and great 'takes' on standards. Would not hesitate to recommend.  (Just don't sit by the door, a bit crazy there)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!  The menu isn't huge, but it is all delicious.  Started off with a Maid in Mexico cocktail and sea salt chips w/ onion dip, and had the scallops for my entree.  Soooo good!  Unfortunately I was too full to have dessert. Service was as good as the food.  They substituted spinach for brussels sprouts in the Sweet Potato Tortelli - the only vegetarian dish here - and my friend loved it. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We are here after flying in from CHICAGO. Food here...southwest....seem salter than what we were used to. Nice ambiance but unfortunately 2 out of 3 kids fell sick after the meal...not sure...."}
{"text":"Last night me and 4 others went here for some grub, and I must say, it was exceptional. I wasn't particularly hungry, so I just got bread, but I knew that my table mates wouldn't be able to finish the massive amount of food they ordered so I was just fine. As we sat down I asked my server (his name was Phoenix),  if he could change the channel of the TV so I could watch the big playoff game and he immediately complied to my needs. Phoenix informed me that he was a Gemini, and I am not particularly fond of male Gemini's, but this one had just the right amount of sarcasm and wit to the point where he was likable, but not annoying. The bread was fantastic, it was laced with lines of balsamic extract and olive oil. On top of a cheese sauce dipping it was some of the best bread I've had in my young life. Other than that, everybody at my table thoroughly enjoyed their food, especially the dessert. My experience at the Arrogant Butcher was nothing life-changing, but I enjoyed my time there and I give it a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar during lunch hour and had excellent service. Ordered the butcher's platter and was blown away not only by the selection of bites but also by the quality of everything. A true treat! The platter included: prosciutto, salumi, aged white cheddar, a salty midnight moon cheese, mustard and jam, 4 huge crusty bread slices, deviled eggs, grilled asparagus, smoked salmon with capers, corn bread bites, bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, and goat cheese stuffed peppers! A great deal and so delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. We sat on the patio and it was a great atmosphere. My husband got the steak and it was delicious. I got the crab stuffed chicken and it was a little bland. Pretzles are a must as an appitizer!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place with local friends.  The service was pleasant but lacked care.  The food was good.  My wife's order was entered wrong.  Our table was done with our meals by the time her correct order was served.   Our bill did not reflect the poor service.   I would go back again and give them another shot.  Good food - please improve service."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time eating dinner at the chef's counter, watching the open kitchen and talking to a couple of the line cooks. The pretzel fondue and Waldorf salad were delicious, and the salted caramel pudding that my waitress recommended for dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the \"Arrogant Butcher.\"  I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work. We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark. He truly made the experience AMAZING!  His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesn't every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!  We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reese's......you have competition now!! =)  The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.  What a great team they are."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Had appetizer of brie, proscuitto and olives, all delish!  Husband and i both had filet mignon...so tender, juicy and flavorful, accompanied by creamed spinach and crispy potato. Dessert was well deserved prize winning caramel pudding. All of the staff were friendly and our waitress, Hailey, provided excellent service...not easy to do with a very busy, all seats taken, restaurant. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Sorry for some that didn't have the same experience but this place is great... Had all appetizers, pretzels, eggs, shrimp, oysters, and salmon rillette - unreal. Service was top notch as well."}
{"text":"Obviously this place is amazing... it already has 280 reviews.   Grabbed lunch here on a Thursday around 12:20pm with a girlfriend. Was told there'd be a ten minute but we weren't kept more than 4 minutes at best. Plus the hostesses were very sweet. In fact, most of the wait staff was good looking. Speaking of good looking, the decor in this place is fantastic. It's a bit noisy and realy thrives off the hustle and bustle of the staff but I loved on attentive the waiters, managers and hostesses were to each table, some not even there own. Small booths have these fantastic burlap covered cone hanging light fixtures and there's a romantic sheer curatined off back room that's probably for intimate banquets. Holler.  We ordered the highly reccommended strawberry lemonades and to quote my waiter, I too, highly recommend the strawberry lemonade. My gal pal and I split the House Pretzels and Fondue and the Grilled Chicken T-somthing salad. Let me tell you, the pretzels changed my life. This wasn't a dinky, over-priced pretzel basket. It has huge pretzel squares that were too big to even fit half in your mouth. THey're so worth all the carbs. And I loved that the salt didn't come off when you picked them up.  The salad was fantastic too. They wre so nice to spilt the salad in 2 bowls for us and keep the dressing to the side. Feta cheese, almonds, grilled chicken, vingertee dressing. Yes, it was sex in a white bowl.  Would go back here and try their antipasta. Sam Fox is a culinary genius."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Right across from chase field. The pretzel and provolone and shrimp appetizers were plentiful and fantastic. Easily enough for four people to share. The crab stuffed chicken was excellent and I was a fan of the kilt lifter beer. We also got the hot chocolate cake and the salted caramel pudding. Both lasted about one minute.  Rachel was fantastic!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Love the food and the atmosphere! I was in last Friday and although it was packed due to Phoenix Comicon, a Dbacks game, the Phoeinix Symphony and first Friday...  We got a table in the bar, had attentive service and made it out just in time to make it to the Phoenix Symphony for our show!   My boyfriend and I went in yesterday to enjoy some drinks and appetizers for the afternoon and had a wonderful time again! Lauren was our server and she was fabulous! Again attentive and made sure we had everything we needed! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed at all. I've heard a lot about this place, so I was excited to go. I ordered the fish and chips. And it seemed like more than half the restaurant had the same idea. So I was pretty confident I made the right choice. But I was quickly disappointed. The fish was average at best. Even the fries were less than expected. High priced food for average or less taste. However I will say that I ordered the pretzel and cheese appetizer, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The cheese fondue & pretzel bite app is the most addictive (and destructive to your arteries) food I have ever eaten. This alone is worth a wait or trip across town. Classy casual eatery, a menu that has something for everyone and good cocktails."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all! If you are going to name yourself arrogant butcher you better make a good steak .....and they didn't, sadly. It was overbooked even after explaining exactly how we wanted it. Bread was hard and cold. Wine took forever to get to us. The manager did comp us the glasses of wine that took so long which was nice. I would say only go for the atmosphere and the drinks! Not the service or food"}
{"text":"Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"The location was great, hopefully an up and coming area of downtown Phoenix. We were there for happy hour and were very dissapointed. While our waiter was very friendly, he never came back to check on us once. The fondue that was raved about was mediocre at best. It was lukewarm and tasted like processed cheese. The \"famous\" onion dip tastes just like Lipton Soup Mix... good, but not famous. The chips were very good.  We won't be going back, except for maybe just a beer."}
{"text":"The food is good and service is friendly; however, be prepared to wait for a table. Bar seating is open, but limited, and forget about sitting outside in the summer (evening or not.)"}
{"text":"We wanted a place to have a drink and a meal before the suns game in talking stick arena; this place was perfect!  Great food perfect mixed drinks; fun atmosphere!  And a short walk to the game"}
{"text":"I will try to eat here every time I visit Phoenix    Hopefully we'll have our server Mickey each time. She is knowledgeable and friendly. The charcuterie platter was a fun way to go. Crab legs were fresh and perfectly cooked. Roasted beet salad was delicious! Blueberry cheesecake comes in a mason jar. Cute."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious! Great service too. Ate and drank here several times over the week. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We are fans of most Fox Restaurant Concepts, but not impressed with our experience here. We had a $50 gift card and decided to try it out after attending a Suns game yesterday afternoon. We started with a glass of wine and beer, and ordered the pretzel fondue. Beer was good, wine was just okay but I expect a better selection from this caliber of restaurant. The pretzels were terrible- hard and way over salted and the cheese had a strange texture, like it had been sitting out for a bit before making it to the table and candle barely lit and went out. We only ate about a third of the appetizer because we were starving. Hoping the entrees were better, we ordered the cheeseburger, which was extremely disappointing for us both. First, the burger barely contained cheese, and they were so tiny they were like the size of sliders in a giant bun. Also, the bottom bun contained some kind of house sauce that was not listed on the menu, and not knowing what it was, I tossed it aside. I took the top of the bun and cut it in half and easily fit my entire burger in it. Then we tasted the burgers and they were just terrible. It tasted like some kind of sauce was mixed into the meat, but we couldn't put our fingers on what it was. The fries were nothing special, and the side salad with champagne vinaigrette was okay- the best of what we ate. I am disappointed that given what we ate (or didn't eat) that we were not offered to remove at least meal. I can say that we will never return here again and very sorry we wasted a gift card here."}
{"text":"OMG...... Let's start with the desserts first. Heaven!!!! Warm peanut butter cup is to die for and a must try. The salted caramel is amazing as well and full of flavor and worth the awards. We indulged and had be chocolate cake as well and it was rich and good but a little dry for a molten. Let's pause on all that for a minute.  Ok going back to the food. We had the butchers plate which had some great choices on the charcuterie and then followed it up with dinner. For the table of three we had the fried chicken and biscuit, the sweet potato tortellini and the short rib stew. All three were good and well flavored. I could have taken a little more spice but it was seasoned well. Drinks special we had the polish and the old fashioned and both were on points  Overall a great pick for dtown Phoenix with good service and a great fun atmosphere. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I chose this place because it's a Fox concept and reviews were inviting. I ordered beet salad to share. Lettuce and a beet well hidden  was very average.  I ordered jambalaya and ate about 3 bites. It tasted like a bunch of leftovers put together-no distinct great flavor. We also ordered prime rib dinner, the Saturday night special. Very average served with a Small mound of mashed potatoes. Meat was not tender. We all concurred the meal was very pricey for what showed up. We had invited a special guest and frankly I was  very disappointed. Nothing wrong with the service or waiter."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour 3-6pm on a Saturday and we had the shrimp, pretzel fondue, mussels, oysters, and the salted caramel pudding. The server was awesome! Great atmosphere and the food arrived quick. Everything was delicious! The pretzels are pretty big and get cold fast if you don't eat them right away (if you want to be picky). We must say that the desert was soooo yummy that we couldn't stop eating it. The salted caramel pudding is a MUST have if you have a sweet tooth like us :)"}
{"text":"I went to one of the soft-opening events for Arrogant Butcher and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was a bit hit-and-miss, but that can be forgiven, considering the restaurant hadn't opened to the public and was still ironing out the bugs.  Our party of four shared the mussels and rock shrimp for appetizers. While the shrimp were good (a bit over-fried for my taste, but the rémoulade was quite tasty), the mussels were outstanding. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and the shellfish was cooked perfectly. My only gripe is with the pomme frites included in the bowl -- were they left out, I wouldn't miss them one iota.   For dinner, our table ordered the salmon, the crab-stuffed chicken and the fish & chips, while I dined on the bone-in rib eye. The dry-aged steak was cooked to perfection and served with a delightfully flavorful jus, though there was a large portion of fat and gristle in the steak. The fish portion of my wife's dish was wonderful, while the chips were nothing more than the fries included with the mussels. The cod was cooked to perfection, and was battered in a spicy beer batter that perfectly complimented the very dilly from-scratch tartar sauce. My dining companions raved about the other dishes.  For dessert, we shared the peanut butter cup, which is composed of a warm peanut butter mousse topped with chocolate gelato. It was decadent and quickly devoured by the four of us.  My biggest gripe comes not about the food, but about the service at the bar, where some in my party waited more than 10 minutes prior to being seated for requests as simple as a martini or a draft beer. I also would have liked to see a larger scotch and whiskey selection, but Fox Concepts does score points for having a quite large selection of Arizona beers, both on tap and in bottles.   I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"A new fan of this place.  Just wondering around downtown, and did not want the standard run of the mill food.  This was a great alternative.  Had the Chicken Club and San-Tan Brew.  Great staff and great all around experience.  It will be a standard for my trips to Phoenix in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife before a bball game.  The food was far better than the game!  The stew was far and away the best i have ever eaten.  The fish and chips reminded me of washington state.  This will be a place i would eat at again and travel far to get there."}
{"text":"A typical Fox restaurant...good!  I eat lunch here regularly and the food is a steady 8/10 every time.  The short rib stew is excellent as well as the French Dip and I'm a French dip fanatic.  Fries are just slightly \"overdone\"...just the way I like them.  Servers are always pleasant and attentive.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me are the hostesses.  Every time I come here (about 1-2 times a week) the hostess seems confused on where to seat people.  I know it's only a couple minutes but the place can be empty and you're going to wait there while the confused hostess stand figures out where to seat you."}
{"text":"The writing on the front door is correct, I was welcomed to my new favorite restaurant.  Logan, or shall I rename him Logan The Amazing, completely enlightened us with a whole other genre of cocktails. Cocktails with the smoothness and subtlest flavor nuances that wine drinkers like us so adore. Starting with the Luxor cherry garnish and right on through the beautiful colors of sunrise in his Howard Hughes, the delicious smoothness of his Kentucky Draper, he wowed us with his artistic use of every type of liquor. My mind is opened and the cocktail standard has been elevated to  unbelievable heights. Oh, and yes, we did eat dinner as well... The food was completely fresh and so delicious. The oysters were as good as anything on the coast, which is a real feat for Arizona! The sea bass was masterfully prepared and the ciopinno was the best, freshest, I have ever had, and I have lived on both coasts. If you can get it, it is a must! The dinner began with the beet salad that was so nicely dressed, with such a smooth dressing that understood it's place was to enhance the vegetables, not try to make a name for itself. The vegetables (beautiful beets must be adored) were all at perfection, making this simply the most well balanced and perfect salad I have ever had. Amber was our server and we are so glad as she was a wonderful guide through our evening. She is kind, fun, and very well versed on the menu. We thank her, above all, for her dessert selection, the salted carmel pudding, and introducing us to Logan!"}
{"text":"Good food, good desserts, good location for basketball and baseball.  Really noisy"}
{"text":"Came in before a baseball game early, around 4 pm.  The place was about 1/3 full.  Immediately upon entering, the hostess told us all of the seats by the windows in the bar section were 'reserved'.  I suppose since were were dressed for a baseball game she assumed we were not going to spend much money; I think that was a bit presumptuous, and in this situation, wrong.  I'm a big fan of Fox restaurants in general---love North, Greenehouse, and Culinary Dropout.  I was a huge fan of Wildflower in Tucson when I lived there 10 yrs ago (I believe this was Fox's first restaurant).  Arrogant Butcher is not up to his standards; not sure if it is management or what.  Maybe his empire is getting too big to maintain universal standards.  The cheese dip with pretzel bread, which was incredible at culinary dropout, came out cold at arrogant butcher, as did the rock shrimp.  The beer was not well chilled.  Food, in general, was a disappointment.  To top it off, the 'reserved' tables by the windows were still empty when we left.  The hostess should learn that a guy in a t-shirt and jeans sometimes has twice as much money in his pocket as a guy in a suit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience, a tad pricey, but it is downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I love the ambiance, the people, and the food! We had Meredith as our server and she was sooo amazing! Loved her! She's fun, bubbly and personable! The only reason why this place didn't get a 5 (this place really should get 4.5) is because the hostess at the front was less than enthuse to see me as a customer, not sure why. But anyhow - this place is BOMB! Bomb bomb bomb!! You MUST come here! And ask to be at Meredith's table!"}
{"text":"We ate here as soon as we got into town. The food was wonderful and the portions sizes are great! The staff was nice and helpful if you need to know what to order and they offer a lot on the menu. The price point is just right and we do plan to visit more in the futore."}
{"text":"Long story short: we were turned away an hour before closing because they were \"at capacity\". I never needed a reservation before. I have had a few incidents of bad food and service with Fox restaurants before and this latest incident almost ruined my night and definitely ruined my feelings about this too trendy and corporate chain of restaurants. Arrogant indeed. I won't be returning here where we always spend at least $100 on dinner and drinks, or any of its sister restaurants under the Fox Concepts umbrella."}
{"text":"It seemed difficult to get attention here and it's pricey for what you get. Sometimes it's been so busy that we didn't wait. Regarding the food, it's above average."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. I would have loved to try something from the drink menu but I was on duty. The place was absolutely packed during lunch time which is always a good sign of excellent food. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Quick review.  Rushed food. (Burned Fries) Slower than normal bar service.  Boring beer selection.  Bad music."}
{"text":"Loud, but the food was great.  My girlfriend and I got seated in the back of the establishment by the TV room. This wouldn't have been an issue if the servers would have left the door closed, but this seemed to be an action somehow about the skill of their pay grade.  Normally that would have been enough to make me get up and leave. I am so glad I didn't.  The Hemingway daiquiri was spot on. A daiquiri isn't supposed to be insanely sweet or sugary, and they got it there. It was sour like it was supposed to be, and high in citrus. I got a drink and my vitamin C for the day. That's WINNING! in my book.  Then they brought out the soft pretzels and gruyere fondu. Holy hell, that was brilliant and delicious. Someone finally came up with a \"foodie\" version of one of my favorite classics of garbage eating.  After my pretzel-gazm I was offered up the skirt steak with green beans, bacon and fingerling potatoes. And again, I was blown away. I don't normally like skirt steak as it tends to be a bit chewey and hard to get through. Not so at Arrogant. It was just right. Not so tender it imploded when the fork hit it, but not so tough that your dentures would come loose if you visited this place from Sun City.   Arrogant Butcher is exactly what down town Phoenix needed. Its smart, the food is good, the service is on point, and its different. I woulda gone 5 stars if it wasn't for being sat next to the TV room."}
{"text":"I have only one thing to say about this place: They have a pretzel fondu. Get that as your appetizer, and don't order your meal until you've tried it. The discerning palette will, after tasting the pretzel fondu, decide to place a second order of pretzel fondu for the main meal. Nothing quiet finishes off a meal like a desert of pretzel fondu, so I recommend that for desert as well. Each course of pretzel fondu can be paired with a different beer from their ample selection.  Follow these instructions and you will not be disappointed. I can not speak to any of their other food since I have not wasted my time trying it."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant and bar in downtown Phoenix. The decor is warm, with a fairly open floor plan. Casual dress is perfectly fine. Service on a Monday evening was excellent. Ordered a meat and bread board, deviled eggs appetizer, a small salad, and the salted caramel dessert. Very pleased with the freshness and taste of all the food."}
{"text":"This place is a must go!! Really great food, but the real reason you have to go if for Tony! Seriously the BEST service I've ever had."}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant itself and the service was good!  But I really wasn't as impressed with the food as I had hoped to be.  A couple of us ordered the ribs and they were overcooked and dry.  I did like the pretzel appetizer - salty cheesy goodness.  But overall, just ok for me.  I would consider returning to try a couple other menu items."}
{"text":"Cool place. Very good service. Had the jambalaya and it was great. Sat at butchers table and that was fun. I will come back."}
{"text":"We came before attending a comedy show and got the distinct opportunity to sit at the chef's table. The culinary staff was entertaining, courteous and understood how hard it is for me to order meals with my dietary allergies and restrictions. They were amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"We entertained clients there.  It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.  Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.    Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.  The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.  I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the \"trendy place to go\" and not because the food was outstanding.    Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop."}
{"text":"Food was decent. The filet was cooked correctly but seemeda little salty.  Sides and veggies were good.  Service was average at best.  For the price range of this restaurant I expected better."}
{"text":"YUM (all caps)! Had to sit at the bar - Saturday night (duh). Started with the Deviled Egg as an appetizer & had Meatloaf dinner sitting at the bar (2-minute wait while Wifey was holding a table at an hour-15). Service at the bar was speedy.  Good selection of beers and spirits  If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular!!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food. Food was ready right on time. It provided great customer service! You won't get cheated out with their toppings! They sandwich the goods between the cheese. We'll be back."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant. The ambiance is upbeat and \" feel good\" from the Tom Petty music to the plaid fabric booths. The service was exceptional. I ordered scallops - they were tasty. My friend ordered artichoke hummus and pita - loved it. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the beautiful November evening  in downtown Phoenix. The prices were quite reasonable. I recommend The Arrogant Butcher if you are looking for a fun, casual night out."}
{"text":"Went here last night per a recommendation.  I was whole heartedly unimpressed - although the food tasted OK, there was no attention around presentation and plating, the bread was stale, and the desserts were large and sickly sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! Love the pretzel and fondue and all the sandwiches! Can't wait to try other items here!!! Service was amazing and they were on top of getting us everything we needed!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was meh. Not meh with an exclamation mark but just ...meh. It wasn't great it wasn't yuck ...just meh. Friendly service, cool looking place but the food was, honestly, quite ordinary. Fried chicken ...ok....the chocolate cake ...fair...the Scottish ale, well, as an Englishman it was neither Scottish not an ale. It was very fizzy and quite was not going to put hair on my chest. So I feel quite good saying it was ...well...meh."}
{"text":"Great find in downtown Phoenix. Near both stadiums. The menu is fresh and interesting salmon to steak and chicken all prepared in imaginative ways. I had the pork carnitas and the \"after school special\" from the bar which is a fun take on a margarita featuring modelo especial, raspberry infused Sauza Tequila, Ginger agave syrup, lime and smoked salt rim.   The carnitas were tender and flavorful without being heavy. The contrast of the sweet corn cake with the salty tomatillo salsa and tender pork is very well balanced.  The atmosphere is casual and fun. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Really delicious. We got the pretzels fondue, which was so tasty. The soft pretzels had great texture and went really well with the provolone fondue - and I'm not usually a fan of provolone.   I had the beef stew, which I highly recommend, it was savory and flavorful. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pretzel fondue is a MUST.  Roasted Beet Salad is amazing.  You can't really go wrong with any of the entrees - though Turkey Pastrami is a favorite of ours.  And if you love dessert, warm peanut butter cup or salted caramel pudding!  The only thing I'd change about this place is to put it closer to my house."}
{"text":"A cool spot to get some drinks and grab a bite. It has a very hip atmosphere and the food is good. With the lack of options downtown this is a go-to spot. The only thing I would say is an issue is the service. It's pretty slow and unattentive, at least at the bar, and service is key."}
{"text":"Yep, Pretty Arrogant at the Butcher's tonight.  Wife and I had our choice of places to visit in our first time downtown Phoenix to eat in years....The reviews were so in Arrogant's favor, yet really let me down, wife was satisfied....   It is obvious by the other 400 reviews that the Butcher just had a bad night with us.  Told we would be seated in 10 min, they forgot us and did not even have us on the list.  Had to ask three times for water, brought all of our food out at once, that would be cheese, salad, oysters, and our dinners, even though we asked to be sure to pace our meal.  Did not give us the \"upgraded\" wine list.  Did not have Med-rare piece of prime rib, sent back, and was charged twice for the meat.    It must have all just been a big mistake, cause everyone else has had a great experience!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Found this place close to my hotel and decided to give it a try. Took a little longer than usual to get takeout, but the neighborhood is good for walking around while you wait. I decided on the meatloaf with mashed potatoes- delicious. I was also pleasantly surprised by the sauce on top. The Cesar salad with Brussels sprouts was a little spicy, but ultimately nothing special."}
{"text":"Let me start with the fact that I loved the service here.   Our waiter Ian was very friendly and made some wonderful suggestions regarding our order. We started with the pretzels and fondue. They were better than I expected!! We chose the Friday night special which was a seafood dish and the crab stuffed chicken.  Both were so flavorful!  The chicken was tender with just the right amount of crab!  We tried the Pink Drink and another cocktail that I can't remember the name of but it had blackberries on top. They were both decently strong and I loved that they use fresh ingredients!  We ended our meal with the Blueberry cheesecake. It was very rich and creamy with a crunchy delicious topping.  All in all I'm a big fan of The Arrogant Butcher and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, sat outside and people watched.   I had high expectations going in but left a bit disappointed.    To start off we had the pretzels and the charcuterie.   Definitely order the pretzels w/ cheese fondue if you go here, it is a must.    For the charcuterie, ordered the prosciutto, truffle cheese, olives and deviled eggs.   While it was not bad, I have had much better.   It was all a la carte and definitely not worth $22.  For dinner, the waitress recommended the crab stuffed chicken.   I thought it was going to be a big chicken breast stuffed w/ crab and cheese.   Instead it was two dry thin breaded pieces of chicken with crab in between.   It was just ok.  For a side note.  A co-worker of mine ordered the scallops and said they were great.    Not sure if I will be back, unless already in the area for something else (concert or game)"}
{"text":"The place is convenient for a quick meal before a game or concert but the menu is not that creative and meals are standard offering with no uniqueness.  Our service was acceptable and understandable slower than normal since they were super busy mainly due to location. They need to update the menu and really focus on better appetizers and better sandwich offerings."}
{"text":"Looking for a family friendly restaurant for our one night in phoenix. Great reviews and they said it was family friendly. Nice atmosphere and parking nearby. But there wasn't any kids menus and not much that kids would like to eat. We got the pretzels and cheese fondue which were great, I'd highly recommend those. I got the short rib stew with the egg on top. It was so spicy I can't really say if it was good or not. Just be warned, I had no idea it was going to be so spicy!!"}
{"text":"Great zucchini fritars and the crispy shrimp was equally delicious  Excellent service  Clean bathrooms"}
{"text":"I've said it once I've said it a million times. I love (almost all) Fox Concepts. The Butcher is another delicous brain child that is a litte reminicent of Culindary Dropout. The fondue is the same at both places which is kind of sad, but other things on the menu really make up for it.  The foi gras was perfectly portioned and moderatly priced. The butternut squash salad was phenomonal. I highly recomment it!  The ambience and decor are both very aethestheically pleasing.. especially with the open kitchen. The wine list is nice and the service was good too."}
{"text":"I came with two of my girlfriends and the food didn't have anything specifically special about it.. I could of added better flavoring making it at home. My salmon was dry. My friends thought the same about their dish. Definitely not worth the money they are asking for it. My friend Cara got some pretty dry chicken as well with her crab filling. This is not a place I am interested in coming to again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and as usual it was wonderful. However I am vegan and it was not easy to figure out dinner for myself.  This is such a wonderful place I was really shocked that there were no vegan, vegetarian or gluten free options.  My friends all had a wonderful dinner and our service was over the top, the only thing you are short on is options for different eating styles.  I will keep checking back for additions to your menu."}
{"text":"Food beat our expectations, which were high since this is a FRC. Freshly shucked oysters, so good! Definitely try the cilantro sauce they are served with. We also had the pretzels and cheese. So good you have to consciously avoid filling up on them! Filet mignon melted in our mouths. The special was prime rib served with scalloped potatoes. We didn't save room for desert. Our server was Mark. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick. He definitely completed the great experience for us!"}
{"text":"Terrible. \"Beet salad\" is wilted lettuce from a bag with a couple chunks of beets and dressing that seems to be from a bottle.  \"Ham charcuterie\" is a few slivers of indifferent ham with dry toast.  Beer was ok.  Fail."}
{"text":"Just checked out the Arrogant Butcher this evening with the boyfriend. The place was surprisingly crowded- a very good sign. We were seated very promptly, and our waiter was very quick to come up and talk to us about the restaurant and the food.  We would up getting the pretzel bread fondue for an appetizer. The boyfriend got fish and chips, and I got the short rib stew.  The fondue was GREAT. It was a last minute buy- I saw another table that had it and got it on impulse. Best impulse of the night. The bread bites were warm, soft and fluffy, and the fondue light and savory. The two of us polished off the rather large bowl with more ease than our waistlines would probably like.   His fish and chips were good. They weren't out of this world, but very decent nonetheless. The fish was melty and flaky, the batter crisp and not too thick. The fries were just fries, but were also crispy and warm. They were the best thing to dunk into my stew gravy.  My short rib stew was AMAZING. It was a bowl of short rib stew in a savory, chile and pepper sauce with a sunny side egg on the top. A piece of cornbread came along with it. The spiciness of the stew was perfect- savory and with a kick, but not to the point where I was crying. The cornbread was sweet, but savory too, from what I could gather was lashings of melted butter on top. The friend egg made it out of this world.  I got a cocktail that the waiter recommended- can't remember what it was named, but it was vodka, lime and muddled raspberries and very clean and refreshing. Quite enjoyable.  But what took the restaurant from 4 to 5 stars was the service. We were unfortunately seated behind a group of very rowdy patrons. They were noisy, vulgar, and had the unfortunate tendency to slam on the table very loudly. But we're city folks, and I live in the hood. You tune this stuff out, and it really didn't bother my boyfriend or myself too much.  I liked that our waiter apologized to us for it. It was annoying, but we assured him all was well. However, when we were walking out the restaurant manager himself apologized about it, gave us his card and told him to ask for him the next time we went there, to make sure he could go out of his way to make up for this experience. I didn't think the experience was dampened THAT much by those a-holes, but I was extremely impressed by the effort made by both him and the waiter. It shows Fox's commitment to making sure that their patrons are taken care of. And that's really awesome.   Definitely go check them out."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was busy for Happy Hour.  Our server was great. We sampled a couple of the cheeses and the toasted almonds which were great.  I tried the halibut which was well prepared, my friends tried the bbq ribs and the steak and liked their entrees too.  The desserts were good too - warm choc cake, salted caramel pudding and the peanut butter.  Great location to stop before a DBacks or Suns game."}
{"text":"We made reservations at the Arrogant Butcher downtown before a show.  They were late seating us.  The menu can best be described as uninspired gastro pub.  Expect to pay $30 for bland scallops in a salty mush.  The plate was dropped or otherwise mishandled as the entree was mashed to one side and dripping off the plate.  If you really need your hot pretzel and synthetic cheese fix, this is your place.  The ambiance is that of a frat party trying to be classy. The food is"}
{"text":"Another Fox hit! Always a great spot for pre-concert food or just a  few drinks with friends. I always get the pretzel and cheese bites, it is seriously heaven in my mouth. Don't pass up adding a few oysters to your entree, either. They are excellent!   If your looking for FAB customer service in the downtown area, this place has got it. Nothing but amazing service."}
{"text":"I can summarize my experience here in one word: \"Meh.\" The food was good, though there weren't many vegetarian options (yes, I know it has \"butcher\" in the name, but for an upscale restaurant I expected at least a couple of options).  The atmosphere was hindered by the TVs everywhere, it was very bizarre to be sitting in a darker and personal restaurant and then have ESPN everywhere you looked.  The food we did have was quite good...the kale salad had delicious dressing. My zucchini fritters sat under the warmers (I could see them from where I was sitting) for nearly 10 minutes after our other food was brought to us before being brought over. The cheese was good, though the bartender didn't know much about it.  When we first sat down, she told us the kitchen was closed (at NINE?), but then checked with the kitchen and said they're still open. She remained unfriendly the entire time.  Very disappointing since this restaurant was recommended by hotel staff and a guest at the hotel who overheard. I've also visited other Fox restaurants in Denver and had wonderful experiences...not sure what went wrong with this one."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be called the Arrogant Server.   The food is good - typical Fox food - very similar menu to Culinary Dropout. Love the turkey pastrami. I would give the food a 4.5.  We ordered drinks, and the server tries to get our food order. Decided on starters, and let the server know that we hadn't decided on entrees yet. Drinks come, and while waiting for the apps to come the server asks if we've figured out the entrees yet. Not yet - sorry - plus I'd like to see the size of the appetizer before deciding between something lighter like the ramen or something hefty like the sandwich.  Appetizers come - and right away before even the chance to put a bite in our mouths, the server comes up and says \"You aren't even going to order entrees, are you\".   Ummm - well, first of all, yes, we are, and secondly, I'd like to get at least 2 drinks during the meal - isn't it better for the restaurant? Better for the server? We ordered entrees, only had time for 1 drink, ate, and left.  The place wasn't even crowded - no need to turn the tables or anything like that."}

{"text":"Okay so here's your review from a Chicagoan in town. I really wanted to like this place. Great name, great music playing and whoever designed the decor deserves a bonus. This place looks and sounds great. If I worked nearby this would be my local option for drinking. Staff are also pros and nice. Now let's get to the food. No joke, fire the chef. Not that the food is bad but it's just nothing specia i.e. bland. It sounds interesting but when it comes out you're like \" eh thats it?\" this place needs food that's WOW!! to match the rest of the package. Also you need to up the craft brew count.  For the record I had the rock shrimp appetizer - aka plain ole fried shrimp. And the beef rib stew - bland with very little meat and putting a fried egg on top didn't do much for the flavor either. Honestly the cornbread was the best part. Get a new chef and revamp the menu. Oh and they need a list of their hard liqour cause there's lots of bottles but only the bar manager knew what kind of scotch they had."}
{"text":"I must admit my dish was delicious but a little over priced for a sloppy joe, even if it was made with turkey.  Everyone else's dishes looked just as delicious but however their desserts looked to die for. A friend had decided to order dessert first before her meal and she was a smart thinker. I had a hard time not grabbing a spoon and stealing it right from under her.   Though I've had better restaurants, I know I would be lying if I said I was never going to come here again. Though next time I come, I'll be smart and get dessert first ;P"}
{"text":"My first imprison  walking into the restaurant was that It is obviously a trendy place to eat. But let me tell you, trends come and go, and this one will fade soon enough.   The menu was limited, so I ended up having the \"Tabouleh\" Salad. Dude it WAS nothing close to a tabouleh! Who puts nuts, lettuce, feta cheese, and  quinoa in a tabouleh? Plus, it wasn't finely diced like a tabuleh should be.  My date had the Scallops  Bacon, Cranberry Beans, Spinach. He hated it! He isn't allergic to scallops, but last night his lip were swollen!   My date wanted to get a gift card from this place, but decided that our bad experience was a sign not to :(  Fox... please do something to fix this!"}
{"text":"parking is ,meter street, garage or paid lot.  French Fries are really good and decent sandwiches. Good place to go when you're downtown."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure why this place is so highly rated. Maybe (probably) I ordered poorly by ordering the jambalaya, I just wasn't feeling a steak. The dish was okay. It wasn't very spicy, and just tasted 'flat', not much going on. Next time if I'm in Phoenix again, I'll go for a steak and re-review, but if they specialize in steaks then maybe they shouldn't be fiddling with other foods they don't know how to do as well. I also think that for the quality, it was overpriced. I will say that our waitress was very kind and the wine was good. :)"}
{"text":"Had drinks and appetizers at the bar the other night; excellent service from Andrew!   Good service and a great personality always add to the experience!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, average food. Don't know what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"After many trips to AB, and a varying degree of experiences I feel compelled to offer up a review.  Location is fantastic - convenient for anyone and any occasion. Menu is OK - no wow to it. Best thing there are the pretzels! The biggest complaint I have is the almost too common, TERRIBLY SLOW service. I recently went to AB with a group of 6 people for lunch at 130pm. Mind you, lunch rush was over. Took a little too long to get seated because we had called ahead and made a reservation - still had to wait 10 minutes.  After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for our beverages to arrive - sparkling water and lemonade ... really?!?!!? It was even worse when we ordered our food. Everyone ordered a salad, get this, it took a full 20 minutes for the salads to arrive in a half empty restaurant. AB should take notice and fix the problem. More and more restaurants are opening up in downtown, people will have more choices and AB will have to eventually address lousy service."}
{"text":"I love most Fox restaurants, and used to like Arrogant Butcher quite a bit. But the last couple of visits have led me to chose elsewhere.   Food has become mediocre- often way too salty and lacks the \"freshness\" I usually appreciate at Fox restaurants. Service was especially poor on my last visit."}
{"text":"The lunch menu pricing not comparable to quality of food. $16 for bland French Dip and $12 for a not fully cooked AB Angus burger. Four Peaks beers were $14 for two beers - thank goodness my lunch companion was drinking lemon water. $50 for lunch is steep, but it would have okay if the food and service was friendlier and service speed was up to par. It took 18 minutes to be served from the time we were seated(we timed it), and then another 20 minutes for food to be served a burger and french dip. Food we ordered because we thought they'd be served fairly fast. The AB was moderately crowded with business types and ASU students/staff on their lunch hour and has a pleasant decor. Very trendy indeed. We were able to wolf-down our lunch and head back to the Student Center at ASU for our meeting in an hour. Not a relaxing meal - again, slow service, loud atmosphere (turn down the music - it's lunchtime, not happy hour!), and expensive and very forgettable food. Do not recommend - there are MUCH better options for a good lunch in central Phoenix - at a lower price point."}
{"text":"Super.   I don't normally eat kale, in fact, I didn't even know kale, until this place popped up.  Now I eat their kale salad every time I'm in there.    Great place any day of the week, anytime of the day - lunch and dinner preferred."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, had drinks while waiting for table to be ready. The gentlemen at the bar were very attentive to service. We were then quickly sat at our table outside. Our waitress was also very attentive. We ordered the butcher board, which we love charcuterie but this included olives, a salmon salsa, 2 deviled eggs, 3 sauces, pistachios,  peppers, and very few salami type of meat, and a small amount of cheese. I would recommend getting the a la carte selections on just cheese and meat because all these extra items weren't that great for us for the price $24.  We split the arrogant butcher burger and it was good, not anything wow though. 4 stars for nice clean place and attentive servers."}
{"text":"ok--i 'm going to make this short and sweet. if you enjoy mediocrity, if you prefer eating at \"safe\" lower common denominator restaurants, then by all means, try any of the sam fox restaurants. but if you have any standards of criticism at all, then avoid them at all cost. i have yet to be thoroughly satisified by any of his choices ranging from sauce, true life, arrogant butcher, and ivy something...so forgettable i cannot even remember the name. i am stumped as to how these places are successful and wonder if these diners have ever had the fortune at eating at true goumet restaruants. you may save a few bucks, and that's a maybe, but the quality of the food is so mundane. it's applebees taken to the next level. sorry, sam, never met you, don't know you, nothing personal. but your business plan really sucks."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Much improved since my visit a few years ago. Good food and cocktails. Jonathan our server was FANTASTIC! Sit in his section!"}
{"text":"Horrible service...forgot to bring me my mustard I asked for (had to ask twice) and then forgot to bring our Jäger bombs! No thanks, glad I'm just passing through and will never be back"}
{"text":"I was excited to experience The Arrogant Butcher for the first time, however the experience was a negative one. We were sat and never greeted by a server. We sat for over 15 minutes while servers passed by, we were completely ignored. Finally we left without any service.   We went around the corner to Squid Ink Sushi where we received great food and great service!"}
{"text":"The place is in a great location, the food is well prepared but overpriced, the bar is nothing special and the beer list is average at best. Service is really good but overall the place is just average."}
{"text":"Wow - what incredible food.  My husband surprised me with concert tickets and we came here for a pre-concert dinner before heading over to Comerica theatre. We started with the highly recommended pretzel fondue and it was fabulous.  My husband had steak and scallops and he raved about his meal, especially the horseradish sauce.  I had a filet and crab and it was incredible, so tender and perfectly cooked.  It came with the most amazing creamed spinach.  We finished our meal with the salted carmel pudding and I can honestly say that I have never had better pudding - it was simply delicious.  They do have a nice outside patio area but in August it was still too hot to enjoy the outside seating.  I will definitely come back, the Arrogant Butcher was fantastic."}
{"text":"was there on a busy Saturday night and thought service and food were excellent.  Had the hummus for an appetizer.  I had crab stuffed chicken, another in my party had the salmon, and another had the ribs.  We all really liked our meals.  Service was fast attentive.  They have a large wine and speciality drink menu I would like to try when back in the area.  Also close to the arena and chase field.  Definitely recommend if in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service!  Tried this restaurant during restaurant week (fall 2011) and have been going back ever since.  I've been for lunch and dinner and the food and drinks are always amazing!  I especially love the soft pretzels and cheese fondue...please never take them off the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere is amazing! I had the Taco and they were just ok. Everyone else loved what they ordered so I will probably try something else the next time we go.   (FYI...Don't sit by the street because the bums will ask to eat your food)"}
{"text":"Was there last night for my daughter birthday. Started out nice....then we got a waitress was not friendly at all. Did ask if we needed anything and when we ask for something she looked like she was mad. We got our food... For a $37 filet mignon it was super dry and came with one TINY potatoe LOL. The salad was warm tastings....and my burger was overcooked. Bill was over $100. Not good feeling paying for that bill...I should of talked to a manager.  5/24/17  Got a message from manager and apologize for services .  So just wanted to say thanks for responding at least you show you care. I know everything can't be perfect but just wanted to share how I felt."}
{"text":"I had the cheeseburger and my coworker had the French dip.  Hands down the best French dip I ever had. (Thanks for sharing co-worker). Melt in your mouth, thinly sliced prime rib, just the right spice horseradish served on the perfect bread.  Worth the $19.  The burger was awesome as well.  It was one of those fancy burgers served with a horseradish aloi.  Great burger, friendly staff, slightly above average price point but worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought the meat and cheese appetizer platter was delicious. The prosciutto was absolutely delicious as well as the different cheeses. The atmosphere was fun and friendly - very busy - with lots of people laughing and having a great time.   I ordered the salmon entree. The salmon was cooked will and topped with sweet apples and pine nuts. Perfect portion to fill you up but not feel too full. Halibut fish and chips was delicious as well. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Got a 6:15PM reservation because we had a show nearby at 8:00PM.  It took them 15 minutes to seat us because they had overbooked.  Our meal had to be rushed.  Our waiter then lost our parking ticket while validating it.  He gave us a replacement.  When we got to the parking deck, we were told the replacement card was not valid and it would cost us $26.  Because of our delayed seating, we didn't have time to remedy the situation, so that snafu ended up costing us.  All in all, a very disappointing experience.  I certainly don't recommend going to this restaurant on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Every dish the table ordered was a knockout, particularly the salmon and the pudding."}
{"text":"Arrogant isn't just the name for this place, they live it. Parking was hard but not their fault. Walked a couple blocks to find the restaurant was closed. It's 1:45. Yelp says it's open at noon. I call and ask what time they open. They say 3. I tell him they should really fix that on Yelp because it's wrong. Guy on the phone says well it says 3 on our website. Honestly if the guy had just apologized I wouldn't even have left a review. But if your gonna be an A-hole, here you go."}
{"text":"AWESOME food and service! Highly recommend the shortrib stew, jambalaya and scallops. With the pinot noir. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"The attention to detail was superb! Chris our waiter noticed how my steak was not well done, as I started to eat, and had it fixed with the manager. The appetizers, mussels and shrimps, were served on time. The manager at the restaurant stopped by to check and addressed and validated. The wine selection was fantastic! A gem of a place - with excellent service."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher was just ok. The ribs were cold by the time they finally arrived. Seems like it's more focused on being a bar than being a restaurant."}
{"text":"The turkey pastrami burger was amazing.. my only regret was that I couldn't eat more than 1 entree haha"}
{"text":"Great dinner we were c coming in for a concert and it's very convenient to downtown food was great atmosphere good people watching overall back there cheese fondue was excellent"}
{"text":"I should have reviewed this place back in March when I ate there. I hope it is going strong because it was great. Somewhere between a bistro and a brew-pub, the food and drinks were great."}
{"text":"I had the Jambalaya and it was great...the bathrooms were great...and the staff was very polite and catering I would hilly recommend this place to friends and I will definitely come again..."}
{"text":"A chain-ish feeling eatery offering accessible food and drinks in a by the books \"cool and urban\" environment. The perfect place to meet other people who are meeting for drinks after work."}
{"text":"Once again, read into a few of the other reviews too much.  Arrived with reservations and was seated in Teddy's section.  service was great.  She knew her wines and was in tune to what we needed.  Food was great - short rib stew - great with a spicy kick.  sea bass was moist and well flavored.  Tortelini's was better than expected.  It was a little loud but loved it so much took customers back the next night!!!"}
{"text":"Do not order the fish. Greasy with a capital G and it wasn't cooked thoroughly. However I enjoyed the goat cheese Brie and chutney with crusty bread appetizer. My friend had the stew. She thought it was decent but wouldn't order it again. We think the fried chicken should be available every night."}
{"text":"Great environment and location is right across the street from Talking Stick Arena which is why we chose this place.  Food was delicious, especially the filet mignon. Fish n Chips were awesome.  The pretzel appetizer bites were delicious with the cheese sauce."}
{"text":"I work downtown and this place is one of my favorites.  I've been here many, many times but this is my first review.  I tend to stick to certain items I've had previously and liked, so I cannot say I've tried even half of their menu, but what I've ordered is always fresh and consistently great.  My favorite is the AB Burger.  Manager Nat is great, so is the staff."}
{"text":"We go here fairly often as it is just down the street from our place. Service is always so good and consistently great food and vibe. I love the salmon and the burgers but the cocktails are great and so are the desserts.  Great place to go before Suns or Diamondback games or whatever takes you downtown."}
{"text":"Just returned from The Arrogant Butcher with my husband. WOW! Great food (the ribs special was BEYOND fabulous), drinks, atmosphere and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I've only been there once. Wish to go back. Soon I hope as it was one of my best experiences in dining. Very busy and hard to get in without a reservation.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Decent, better options in the area... a bit over priced. Food was average,  drinks good but pricey and atmosphere was loud and distracting."}
{"text":"Arrogant Butcher - sat at the bar (score! Saturday night, duh). Started with the Deviled Egg as an appetizer & had Scallops with roasted Brussels sprouts & sweet potato dinner sitting at the bar (2-minute wait while I also was holding a table at an 1-1/4 hour wait!). Service at the bar was speedy -  Ryan, with his custom binder clip tie-tack was fabulous. Good selection of beers & spirits. If we lived in Phoenix, we'd be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Let me first say I nor my boyfriend are people to complain or send our food back, however, when you are 0 for 2 on getting the order right, we unfortunately did. The food was great once they got it right! Delicious. Waitress was nice but the times we saw her were few and far between and had to stare at our incorrect food while we (starvingly) waited for the corrected order to arrived. When we got our bill we were surprised to see no discount whatsoever. Just sucks to wait that long for a meal and being taunted by the meal we could have had 30 minutes earlier with no grace on what we paid."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant and it was yet again another great find!  The Butcher' Platter was a great sampling and amazing.   Waitress was absolutely great!  A great appetizer and beer stop!  We went before a basketball game."}
{"text":"Amazing service, cocktails, and food!! Absolutely satisfying and worth the try. Steak, desserts, fries, french dip, and the antipasti platter."}
{"text":"Never too late to write a review unless you forget the experience and have nothing to write. My husband and I have been there twice. The beef short rib stew and sloppy joes are amazing. Pass on the rock shrimp, these are not Florida rock shrimp...good sauce though."}
{"text":"The food was good but over priced.  I had fish and chips and it cost $18.  The environment was great."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service for a Monday evening, arriving an hour before closing time. Good bar selection, plenty of solid high end Scotch and Tequila. The soft pretzel and provolone fondue appetizer was simply amazing. Oysters were tasty, and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly--slightly charred on the outside and rare in the center. All food was excellent. I'm very discriminating with 5 star reviews, but this deserves a high 4 star. Will definitely return here on visits to Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pretty good location nearby US Airways Center. Sat outside patio. Pretty nice. Personally, I would have preferred the crispy shrimps if it was not salted over. AB burger was good."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The crab stuffed chicken looked a little different than I had envisioned was the blend of sauce, with the chicken and crab was great! Also, the chefs platter with cheese and was meats was a very pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! Get the pretzel fondue or the Chef's plate. Also, their specialty cocktails are amazing.  It has a \"chain\" feel when it comes to service... but if you just want a good cocktail and some apps, I'd try it out."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance, Cordial and prompt service! Had the pretzel bites with melted provolone, you get about a dozen of these full size pretzel bites! Fish tacos were also great. Will definitely make my way back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were in from out of town. We sat at the bar around happy hour. Not many folks there to begin but quickly filled up!  The bar was a great spot to people watch and enjoy the view of the street hustle and bustle.   We enjoyed the crispy shrimp and zucchini fritters. The bar service was adequate, not friendly.   The bathroom in a side note was nice!  Great place overall. I would return."}
{"text":"If in PHX . . . don't miss this place, it is ktty-corner to the Phoenix Suns arena.  Food, food and food.  The hummus was perfect, the charcuterie platter was decadent, spare-ribs not too saucy (I actually hate saucy ribs but liked theirs) and the short-ribs with the egg on top . . . a delight for your taste buds.  One of my biz partners actually had the Sea Bass in this bastion of beef and they managed to broil it just right (yep, I did have a bite of it).  To top it all off they have Tito's Vodka!!!  Great service.  Great food, You'll leave fat n happy."}
{"text":"We went for dinner before the 3 doors down concert. Amber was very good at her job. She was pleasant, knowledgeable and an all around nice person. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the variety of drinks. The plum, ginger Mojito was different bit very tasty. Dinner was equally delicious. I had the steak special and my wife had the lemon stuffed chicken. Both meals were excellent with just the right portions. We were full bit no stuffed. Kudos to the staff as the restaurant got crowded they we never lacked in service and did not have anyone loud or obnoxious by us. Although this a bit of drive from our house we will make the trip for the service and food"}
{"text":"2nd visit review.--- decided to give this place a second chance.   I am glad I did!!  Service was 5 starts for sure!  Nathan was our server and he was amazing.  Checked on us frequently and or drinks were always full.   The food was also good...  We order the fondue again,  cheese was amazing this time.  Zucchini fritters with aioli were very good.  Burger had good flavor and fries were great.  Lastly the carnitas were also very tasty.     I was hesitant to come here again after my last experience,  but the second time was amazing!  We will come back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun place, great location and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Food was super great! Very great costumer service. Recommend 100% must try the delicious crab legs and the pretzel fondue. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I found everyone in Phoenix to be very pleasant and the staff here was no exception. They accommodated my anticipated large dinner party and when we turned out not to be so large, they simply took the end table we weren't using about midway through our meal. Our server was very laid back, but made sure we had everything we needed at all times. The food came out quickly, was hot and delicious.   The pretzel fondue wasn't bad, I would've preferred like a cheddar cheese instead of melted provolone, something more sharp and flavorful to go with the fluffy pretzels. I loved the salmon appetizer stuff! That was unique and tasty, definitely recommend it to those who like lox.  The ambiance of the place is probably why a lot of people keep going back; and it's especially nice as the sun sets over the city of Phoenix, you can drink in the atmosphere and cool breeze all while inside, sitting comfortably. Next time I'm in town I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem in the middle of Phoenix. Amazing food, fab location, great outdoor seating and the best service ever. Delightful wait staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for beers after the kansas state pep rally for the fiesta bowl. They ran out of light beer, but the waitress kept our drinks coming, even though it was packed.  2 twenty-ounce hefeweisens was about $12 with tips.   Didn't try the food, but would come back."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing salad I have ever had. The chopped salmon salad was incredible. The service was great, hostesses incredibly hot and a great atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good service and food is good quality. I had a reservation but it was a busy weeknight so I had to wait about 10 minutes which wasn't too bad. The server was nice about the 4 of us splitting our checks and kept track so that everyone got the right checks. I know some places don't like that or screw up all the checks so I appreciate them doing it. Drinks and food had good variety. It's a nice spot near the convention center to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and pleasant wait staff.  A waitress was dusting liquor shelving above the bar.  Nice that they were keeping it clean but the drink condiments were under the shelving, (olives, lemons, limes, etc...)."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is good!  I really enjoyed the patio dining experience. The service was exceptional. Our waiter shared responsibilities with other on the patio making it feel like we had a crew of three to wait on us. We were seated immediately on a Saturday afternoon. The place was crowded, but didn't feel like it.  Oysters on the half shell were fresh. It was a great appetizer. I had the Jambalaya and would recommend it."}
{"text":"A barely OK if you ask me.  I went there before a Suns game and even on an event day, the service was pretty decent. That's what gives the most stars of my review.  The pretzels with dipping cheese were tasteless, the steak was uneventful and the fish and chips that my companion had weren't impressive either.  The desert was good, though.  The bill wasn't pleasant either. Over $100 for 2 without alcohol.   I guess this place really honors its name. Pretty arrogant yet just a butcher.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Lobster mac & cheese was AWESOME! The server was super nice. Pesto sauce pretty good, seemed like pesto was just mixed with olive oil, but was ok. The bread was NOT fresh or warm. Over all... 4/5 is my vote."}
{"text":"This is a weird place.  So expensive, ($30 entrees) but you feel like you're eating in an arcade or bad sports bar. Cheap formica tables that it seems are intended to have a tablecloth or something covering them . . . and neither of our entrees arrived as described on the menu. When we casually asked the waiter about that, he tried to convince us we were incorrect, so we asked to see the menu again, and then he acted so surprised that we were correct. Not returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is Absolutely fantastic! Nothing bad to say about this place at all.. Priced right, atmosphere perfect and great wait staff."}
{"text":"Just had appetizers and drinks, the pretzels were amazing.  The nachos were okay at best,  the chips were great but I don't think there was enough ingredients on top to be considered nachos.  Maybe they should serve it with a side of salsa so you have something to do with all the empty chips."}
{"text":"Everything was relatively good, however, we found parasites in our oysters. We were told they were \"baby shrimp\"."}
{"text":"Great food! Service was fantastic! I had reservation and was running behind due to traffic. We told our server that we were in a time crunch because we were headed to the  symphony and she made sure we got our meals quickly. Oysters are great! Sea Bass was delicious! We also ordered the Green chile short rib stew was good, but not enough meat. Highly recommend making reservations. They are busy!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed the Pompeii exhibit at the Science Center and thought it was time to try Fox's The Arrogant Butcher. I must sadly say we were unimpressed. My husband ordered the Beef Stew, no flavor, soupy rather than stewy and light on the beef...not good for the man. My teenagers had the fish tacos and my daughter said Rubio's were better (not good when $17 a plate). My youngest ordered the fish and chips and  said that the plate was 'light on the fish'! Two pretty small pieces accompanied by soggy and over salted fries.  My Goddess Caesar was overdressed and over-cheesed, too light on the avocado. The saving grace was the Pretzels and Fondue appetizer. I think we should have stuck with the appetizer and a charcuterie platter and saved ourselves $100. When Downtown, stick with Nook Kitchen or Bianco..."}
{"text":"I've been to this Resturant couple times and they did fair job. Today, Cobb Salad came out with a dead fly. Manger took the cobb salad off the bill but it was disgusting having to look at a dead fly and having to leave to go to another Resturant for lunch was just not acceptable! Plus if your sitting outside on patio you will get attacked by so many flys as well!!! Not happy the experience will not return."}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to say the that the Arrogant Butcher, and especially the General Manager completely redeemed themselves.  After the first review I wrote last week about a not so stellar experience, I was contacted by them and allowed them to contact me to discuss.  The General Manager, Peter, was very apologetic and asked if we would be willing to come back on a credit of what we originally spent and let them try again.  We graciously accepted and worked out a convenient time to return - which was last night, just 8 days after our original visit.  Everything about the 2nd experience was different.  We were given brand new menus (no food stains or rips.  We were met by the General Manager shortly after being seated and welcomed back and appreciated for giving them a 2nd chance.   The server was very knowledgeable about the menu - asked us on a few different occasions if we had any questions, and when we did explained the food choices in detail.  He was virtually always present and available, yet he had several other tables in the area he was also attending to - which he seemed to be giving everyone the same excellent service we were receiving - nice to see.  We ordered the soft pretzels and provolone fondue as a appetizer - definitely enough of an appetizer for like 4 people - we ended up not eating all the pretzels to save some room for our entrees - which were exceptional.  One of us ordered the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection.  The other of us ordered the crab stuffed chicken and I can't stop raving about it.  In addition to the exceptional service the waiter provided, Peter also checked in with us from time to time and repeatedly thanked us for giving them another opportunity.    Must have been an off night the first time - which happens, but what speaks volumes is how Peter and his team \"made it right\".  Also, he comped the entire meal, which was greater in price than our original - not expected, but very much appreciated.  Thanks Peter and Arrogant Butcher - we are now fans!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner before heading to an event at The Talking Stick Arena.  Service was friendly and we got our food quick and drinks were good as well.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Was in town for business, and decided to stop into the Arrogant Butcher. Really enjoyed the meal, the service, etc. Overall a good experience. The menu is a bit limited compared to some others places you might visit but that's not a bad thing. Have a solid selection of dishes done really well instead of 100 choice done mediocre is a great thing.   The shrimp appetizer was fantastic. Super easy to over-cook shrimp but this was cooked perfectly. With a nice light batter instead of heavy breading and a few shishito peppers tossed in this is something I would order again.   The sea bass was also a solid choice. Again, we found perfectly cooked fish that remained moist and tasty in an average sized dish.   The jambalaya was good, but nothing to right home about. Decent portion size, and absolutely nothing to complain about just wasn't a standout compared to the others.   Great location to stop before a D'backs or Suns game! Give ti a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy and loved the pretzel bites and the kale salad! Definitely will get to this restaurant again when visiting Phoenix. They had outdoor seating which was fun in February for this Omahan:)"}
{"text":"Good drinks and a nice array of food.  We enjoyed oysters, some cheeses and our meals were all very tasty.  Great place in downtown Phoenix.  Well recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, appalling service. Waiter got the order wrong and left half of it off with no apologies. Never checked on us, drinks went dry. For such an expensive restaurant (which means huge tip) I expected a lot more. In fact somebody did come over to apologize for the delay on the food, but it wasn't our waiter. He never even acknowledged any of the mistakes! That's too bad, because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Went to grab drinks and appetizers here before a Suns game, and really loved it. Great ambiance, and loved that they open the bar windows up on nice nights allowing for a breeze. Right in downtown close to US Airways Center, many other bars, and the metro link. The cheese plates are outstanding, and both the lunch and dinner menus offer both different and traditional meals.   Will definitely be stopping by here anytime I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for comfort food. We live in downtown Phoenix and have visited this place in excess of 6 times in the last 9 months.   SERVICE -- -- consistently poor, increasingly careless (used to be OK, now it's pathetic) -- latest visit saw our steak overdone and crab cold -- the service was inattentive at best, horrid at worst -- server forgot to place an order for an appetizer (and then delivered the wrong appetizer)  FOOD -- -- food is consistently good, if served warm (last 2 visits, food was cold) -- drinks are consistently good, if delivered promptly (which seldom happens) -- food quality has drastically plummeted over the past 9 months  AMBIANCE: -- pretty good -- outside seating / patio seating is very nice -- location is central  VERDICT: -- unlikely to visit anytime soon -- for a typical check of $110 or more (see photos), I would go elsewhere -- save yourself time, money, hassle and headache and go to a myriad of different places in the area. -- Have seen similar deterioration in service and food quality at other Fox restaurants in the area (looking at you, North and Olive + Ivy)."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and we didn't know where to eat so I asked at the hotel and they told me about this place and the guy behind the counter said the food was terrific a bunch of us about 30 of us went there for dinner and everybody agreed with him the food was terrific the service was good and the pricing was reasonable easily a five-star restaurant"}
{"text":"Like the fact that when we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and then she asked us where we would like to sit  Once we were comfortably seated the team affect over we were serve drinks appetizers and entrées all  y different servers,I kind of like that approach"}
{"text":"Frankly, not sure what all the fuss is about.  It was fine; not great, not lousy, just fine.  We stopped in during happy hour before heading to the Giants/Dbacks opening game.  (Giants won, yay!)  The place was reasonably busy, but not crazy given that there were still a lot of empty tables.  We chose a number of items from the bar menu - pretzel rolls with cheese fondue, an antipasto plate, grilled mushrooms and marcona almonds.  The cheese fondue was about as bland as cheese can be and the pretzel rolls looked good, but were more bready than chewy like a pretzel should be and they pretty much tasted like pancakes.  The antipasto plate was a few slices of shaved salami, 2 small pieces of French bread and about a teaspoon of some kind of goat cheese.  This came with a small amount of house mustard and a cherry jam or chutney.  The plate was about 5 times too large for the small amount of stuff.  I don't know if they forgot something or this is just what they serve.  We ended up dumping the mustard in the fondue and that made it taste a lot better, so at least it served some purpose.  Maybe they should use this idea and do this, too?  The service was average at best.  We were seated quickly and our server, Tom, started out on a good note, but he was not in the picture much after we were served.  Our beers were long gone before he showed back up again, and the second round that we ordered was long in coming. The other tables near us seemed like they were having the same experience.  Don't know if this is the norm for their service.  Like I said, nothing was horrible, nothing was great.  It was just OK.  This is probably a 2 to 2.5 star experience, but the Giants won so I'm rounding up.  Maybe we should have ordered a burger or something.  Who knows?"}
{"text":"Overall liked this place. I had the side salad and cioppino. The dishes were delicious just small in portion.  The dessert may have been the best part. We tried the peanut butter dessert, the chocolate dessert and salted caramel dessert.  The best one was the salted caramel. OMG SO GOOD that you would go back JUST for that dessert. Oh and may I say that the service was probably the best service I have ever had. Wish I remembered my servers name so I could mention him here.  He was so awesome."}
{"text":"As I am a supporter of downtown Phoenix and hope that Cityscape thrives, I decided to have lunch here with girlfriends. I wasn't sure what to expect but judging by the name of the restaurant, I thought this would be mainly a steakhouse. I was totally wrong. I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. This is the type of place that downtown Phoenix needs. It's contemporary American cuisine at its finest. The decor is modern and hip without being terribly ostentatious. The vibe reminded me of Chicago and NYC. It has a sophistication without pretension feel.  I had the Crab Cake Louie salad which I felt was exquisite. Everything tasted fresh without that fishy taste like crab cakes served in other places, nor was it overly breaded. The vegetables were crisp and the dressing was sweet, light, and spicy. I wanted to try more dishes but I practically licked my plate clean. My girlfriends were also enamored by this place and wanted to stay later but we all just agreed that we'll be back for Happy Hour and dinner. I would have given this place 5 stars but they aren't open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Best pretzels ever!!!!!!  Service is great, atmosphere is aweseom... but those pretzels..."}
{"text":"This place is ok, nothing special.  I have been here 4 times, 3 times for lunch and recently for dinner.  I know this place is always busy and can get pretty crowded, but I'm baffled on why.  The location is awesome, its literally across the street from the US Airways arena, and there's alot going on in this block.  The ambiance is really nice, and they have some really cool photo's around the place, but as you know what I say, It's all about the food.  The prices are pretty high and the food and portions are nothing to brag about.  We arrived on a Saturday night, it was 10 of us.  We made a reservation at 6:00 and we're seated right away.  The service was pretty poor, but since we had a big group, figured there would be more than one waiter for our table.  We ordered some appetizers which we split and my lady ordered the Chicken stuffed with crab with a side of potatoes.  I ordered the Fish and Chips.  I hear some really positive reviews about their pretzels and fondue, but I thought it was gross.  We were all talking and chatting, and by the time we dived in the fondue, it developed a thick layer on top, which you commonly see from processed cheese like Velveeta, and when I dipped the pretzel it pulled the thick layer with it. That's why its under a fire, cause soon when it gets room temperature, it hardened up.  Not impressed at all, but if you like Velveeta, you might like their fondue.  The meat and cheese board was a joke, and the hummus was bland.  The main course arrived.  Since I had a horrible experience with my last fish and Chips (The Codfather) I felt I needed something to redeem my last experience.  The fish and chips were pretty good.  I requested some tartar sauce, not this ranch cr*p they gave me and malt vinegar, but it never arrived.  So I just ate it plain. My lady ordered the Chicken stuff with crab dish.  Like I read in a previous post, I have no clue what it was stuffed with, cause it sure wasn't crab.  It was like minced crab if anything else.  Really disappointing dish, especially for that price.  Food=C.  Very mediocre.  Portions are small and very little creativity.  Appetizers were terrible and quality of the ingredients are poor.  I have no clue what that chicken was stuffed with.  If I had to bet, it was minced crab out of a can.  Terrible.  Service=D.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  We had 10 people in our group and he tried to accommodate everybody, but clearly couldn't handle the group.  I had to request my drink to be refilled several times and it took a while to get it filled.  I asked for lemons for my lady, it never arrived.  I asked for Tartar sauce and Malt Vinegar, that never arrived either.  Not impressed with The Arrogant Butcher.  I've been to several FOX concepts restaurants but this one is probably the worst.  Culinary Dropout is a close second.   I do like North a lot though.  Maybe I'll just stick to that one.  I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Butcher you get 5 stars for the Turkey Pastrami.  I meet my girlfriend here for lunch a couple times a month and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Weird beginning about getting seated.  Had a reservation on Opentable for 2 for 12:15pm on a Thursday. Called and made it for 3 and they said they could accommodate me. Showed up at 12:03 and they would 't seat us at first although there were numerous tables open. The explanation was complicated.  Once seated, the grilled fish tacos were calling my name although I came for a salad.  I made the right choice although my friend who had the salmon kale salad said it was really good. These were the best fish tacos I've had in a long time. The two tacos were of a good portion and double tortilla wrapped, like in Mexico. The fish was meaty and hot. The cabbage slaw refreshing and not overpowering. It came with two limes to squeeze. Plus had a minimal sauce inside. The white beans on the side were excellent. I would come back here again and get this same dish!!  Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.  First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.  Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.  Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.  Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.     Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here. No value  Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak. My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.  Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.  Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!"}
{"text":"On the charcuterie menu happy little pots of mustard or chutney accompany salami and an assortment of other delicious cheeses. The evoo and balsamic dip with their fresh baked crusty bread were carbohydrate heaven. The atmosphere was bustling and hip, not ideal for a romantic evening but perfect for a delicious bite prior to a downtown event. Will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten there has be exceptional! I especially love the beef stew. Food is great and service is friendly. A little pricey, but you're definitely getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the mussels! They give you a large amount and the taste is out of this world! Great service also! Highly recommend to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Came here for the pretzel and fondue and the salted caramel pudding. I wasn't really impressed. The fondue was bland but the pretzel bites were good. The salted caramel pudding was a disappointment. Tasted like a jar of melted werthers."}
{"text":"We ran in to the arrogant butcher to grab a quick bite before going to our concert. We ended up sitting at the bar high top which was great since thats where they have the happy hour menu available. We had a few orders of nachos, a cheese plate and a salad and it all was very good! It was a very quick visit but like all Fox restaurants, you get good service and a great atmosphere. Now if they would only open a True Food in Tucson I would be a happy camper! Will def be back and I loved the industrial interior!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in downtown Phoenix.  Love the local brews on tap. Be sure to have the soft pretzel with cheese sauce!"}
{"text":"Not amazing. Just \"fine\" Focused on high volume sacrificing quality.  Prime Rib was underseasoned."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang before games downtown.  Can get pretty crowded, but there's usually space at the bar.  Get there early!"}
{"text":"Very good scallops. The hot chocolate dessert cake was the best dessert on the menu. My colleagues really liked the steak and were happy with the wine. Carrie the waitress did an excellent job handling a large group. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour today with a pretty large group and they were very accommodating! We were there for pretty much the entire happy hour, although a limited selection, the prices were good. For a total of 8 people a several drinks and appetizers to keep us satisfied, the check was just over $120. The pretzels are AMAZING (served hot but cold is still delicious, especially after a few drinks). The nachos are also good, just a little messy. I exclusively drank \"The Maid\" and it's so fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Friendly service, dinner was ok....a bit expensive for what it is. The pretzel bites were awesome and so was the kale salad. Will eat here again, but choose a less expensive meal."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  Showed up with my party w/out reservations one night with three sold-out venues within walking distance nearby (admittedly my poor planning). Although we had to wait to be seated, the staff graciously accommodated us. Despite being seriously busy, our Server was the coolest ever.  All of our courses were still prompt and they were all seriously delicious!  The food was visually appealing and not hidden under mystery sauces. My husband said the prime rib was one of his favorites. With better planning on nearby traffic, we will make this a frequent stop."}
{"text":"We showed up without a reservation on a Saturday night (dumb) and were given a 45 minute way. We got seated in less than 30 minutes! And with the downtown location, there's plenty to do in the meantime. I liked the text message system to let me know when our table was ready.  The service was terrific. We were seated on the patio, but heat lamps kept us from being too chilly.  I ordered the barbecue chicken entree. It was good but not amazing. The chicken was a little dry and it didn't taste much like barbecue. I LOVED the coleslaw that came with it and the cornbread muffin was delicious."}
{"text":"We loved it!! I had the New York Strip Teak and she had the best Meatloaf I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Went to arragont butcher with the wife for mothers day.  Very nice place, open floor plan with kitchen right in open view. Ordered the meatloaf dinner. The meatloaf was very good. It came with what they called potato puree and string beans. Although the piece of meatloaf was very good and thick, there really wasnt much. The potato puree made a fork full and the string beans was two fork stabs. I did have the blueberry cheese cake for dessert, which i normally wouldnt have had if i wasnt still so hungry from the very tiny portions of food. The cheese cake comes in a little jar and even eating after dinner still leaves you hungry. All in all the food was tasty but for the money i wont eat there again because i like to leave a place feeling a bit full. Thank god i found a portillos on the drive home, we ordered dinner again and i found it much more satifying."}
{"text":"The pretzels and nacho cheese are 2 stars. Supposedly it is provolone fondue but its laughable, I swear I had nacho cheese. I'm from Switzerland and we have great fondue and so does the Citizen Public House in Scottsdale. Phenomenal Fondue and bone marrow butter. We didn't finish the fondue here at the arrogant butcher, and my buddy thought it was disgusting.  The New York Strip is 4 stars but I've had better. The mashed potatoes with reduced wine sauce was alright. Maybe 3.5 stars.  Now my food was a lot of mixed things. I love variety and got the butchers plate for 23 dollars.  My plate with mixed cheese, sliced meat, was alright but not even close to the best. Maybe good jam and mustard and really good devilled eggs but olives and bread was below par.  People are easily satisfied and give it 5 stars. Well I guess I just had really good food before around the world to say this is not bad but I won't go again. If I go to a place and it doesn't knock me of my feet I won't go again. There are too many choices and to be successful you need to be the best or have something special. The only thing special at this place is its name. Now I know why I hate arrogant people or butchers. They think they are better than they really are. Unless you have a lot of people that just don't know better, you might have a chance, which is the case in a lot of cities."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this location or the staff.  The food was sub par, the service was lacking, and overall it was not a good experience.  For the amount of $$ per dish I expect it to be prepared better"}
{"text":"Went here on a repeat visit after an ok visit last time. We were seated in an empty room in he back. The staff was back there in a meeting. We waited a while for service and while the room was set. Menus were food stained. We. Waited another few minutes without service and decided to leave. Ending it before it totally tanked. Can't review he food here but what a bummer."}
{"text":"Good food great atmosphere in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  I take a lot of my customers here for lunch."}
{"text":"I have heard about this restaurant, and decided to surprise my partner for date night.  We had oysters & the Brie cheese to start.  Both were very tasty & a good value.  For our main entree, I had the jambalaya & my partner had the ribs.  OMG...they were SO delicious.  Initially I was concerned that the jambalaya would be too spicy, but I'm glad I went with my gut because it was the most flavorful & not too spicy.  For dessert, we had the peanut butter cup and it was a surprisingly unique sweet.  The 2 peanut butter cookies with a chocolate drop center were the perfect finish to the dessert. The service was a bit slow, but we were not in a hurry.  Although slow, our server was very attentive & helpful when present. We most definitely will be back to try some of the other enticing dishes.  2 thumbs up from both of us!"}
{"text":"Really a great place: airy and contemporary decor, pleasant staff and attentive service. Not the fastest food service as all the items are made from scratch and fresh ingredients.  The appetizers are awesome such as the \"butchers block\" and corn soup to die for.  This place is great for just drinks or full blown dinner."}
{"text":"I had some PHENOM jumbalaya when my husband and I came here, but remember feeling surprised when I saw the pricing of how much our dinner cost. Will have to save this place for special occasions only."}
{"text":"Our server Michael was amazing! We tried everything he recommended and it did not disappoint. Loved the carnitas nachos! Located in a fun area of Phoenix"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite spots in Phoenix! The best things at The Arrogant Butcher are the Polish Fix and the pretzel rolls with fondue.   My friends and I dream about the polish fix. Perfectly crushed ice, lemon juice, macerated raspberries, and vodka. Perfection!   I'm a fan of the sweet potato tortelli. Last time I was there, I added scallops to the entree, which were great."}
{"text":"We took a friend for his birthday, there were 7 of us. From all the reviews I read I thought it was more of an upscale restaurant but it was more urban bar. The place was very noisy, the speakers blaring music above our table made it hard to hold a conversation even across the table! For a Monday it was fairly busy when we got there at 6PM, The service was OK, our waiter forgot our appetizer so we had to remind him. The food was very good, worthy of another visit. This would be a great place if the music was turned down!"}
{"text":"Busy place for Dinner, expect a bit of a wait. I would recommend the chef's counter as a place to dine. Great food and excellent service. Price to performance very acceptable."}
{"text":"I have been to the here several times as part of a group and a romantic date with my wife. Let's start with the positive. Great location in downtown Phoenix. Easy to stop by when going to a game or other events downtown. The food is nothin special, not bad, but not great. I'm a beer drinker and I am always underwhelmed by the selection they have as well. Would I go back? Probably. Will I be raving about my experiences to anyone who will listen? No."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. However, I would expect to have a $40 steak cooked correctly. I asked for it to be medium and received a very well done steak. I had to be somewhere and was on a time schedule so bad to eat the $40 piece of leather. Also not sure that the health department is ok for people preparing food to have their long un groomed beard without a hair net. Glad I didn't get hair in my food."}
{"text":"We love this place. The atmosphere is great and the service not too intrusive. We started with the pretzles with fondue. This is one of the best things I have ever eaten. I love bread and I love cheese. The pretzles are soft, buttery hot vehicles for creamy, warm provelone fondue...mmmmmm. Our entrees were also delicious. We ordered the bolognese and the stew. Both were tasty and well prepared. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner before a concert here at the bar. Place was packed on a Sunday night and sitting at the bar was great. Plus a poke stop near by. :)  Food was great and large portions. The only dock of a star was due to the prochutto (sorry for the spelling) being not the best. Despite the spelling I eat a lot of this cured goodness. And for ten dollars I would expect more. Other than that, the deviled eggs were FANTASTIC. Drinks were great and the bartender listened well to special requests."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time by recommendation by a friend, and loved it! I had the Pretzel Fondue, Oysters and the Beef Short Rib Stew, all of which was delicious! This was my first time but surely not my last!"}
{"text":"Trying too hard to be the hip place.   Perhaps the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat in at the bar but the atmosphere was very festive the early Friday evening we were there. The Sweat Potato Tortilini was not only meat free but creative and delicious. But for the price left both of us needing a second plates. There were too many negative factors to give it a great review, just average."}
{"text":"I had NO idea that a place called The Arrogant Butcher would feed me one of the best meals I've had in my life on 11/18/11.  I was giving my friend the side-eye when he suggested it.  Cuz I already know meat eaters look at us vegetarians crazy when we go someplace OBVIOUSLY meat-affiliated then want to complain, \"There's nothing here for me to eat!\"  But he insisted, so I went with it.  Umm...the Sweet Potato Tortelli is the BUSINESS!   Sweet potatoes, mushrooms, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts?  Who'd a thunk it?  Wow!  The combination of flavors and texture play...I could eat this all day...like for real-for real.   For dessert, we had yummy \"hot chocolate\" cake.  I left belly-full and grinning.  Just a few blocks from Stand Up Live, this was a great way to end a night of comedy!  The bonus:  they validate parking."}
{"text":"Fox, you surprised me!  After going to four different Fox Concept restaurants and leaving unimpressed every time, we tried the Arrogant Butcher.  Maybe we've just had bad luck at the other restaurants in the portfolio, maybe Arrogant Butcher is the star of the show.  Anyways, enough about that.  We came eArly on a Friday evening, managed to catch the very end of happy hour.  Had the pretzels, they were very good...I'd ask for a half size portion next time, they're so good you can't leave one behind.    Since it was Friday I had the king crab cioppino, it was excellent.  The crab was not a few flakes thrown in just for the name, big sweet pieces right on top.  The supporting cast of fruits de mer were just as good.  They did a great job on this dish.    Oh, totally need to mention the service the waiter was great.  The lady even mentioned how good the quality of customer service was here.  As we were paying he asked if we had parked at city centre....validated parking.  Not a big deal, but a really good touch.  We will be back.  Maybe we will even try another Fox...."}
{"text":"Great fun place for groups. Did a girls night out with rowdy women and they accommodated our table of nine with grace. Food was nicely done,wait staff fun, hard working and attentive. Drinks were top notch. Location across from arena made concert going even better.got very busy as night went on , loud , noisy  but then so were we! So glad we got in!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Didn't quite meet the hype, but the hype was substantial. Definitely not bad."}
{"text":"I have heard mixed reviews about this place, but I liked it!   I came on a Thursday night to watch the game, and it was busy in the dining area so we easily sat at the bar (open seating). We got the pretzel bites - you get a LOT -, the butchers platter, and the waldorf salad.  All items were good, but the butcher's platter was the winner. For two people, it worked out well. We definitely could have gone without the pretzel bites, but oh well!  As far as drinks, I got the polish fix. It was good and refreshing. I really liked the real fruit they included too.   Overall, it was a fun, chill experience."}
{"text":"OMG!!! CAn I say that this place is just fabulous fabulous fabulous!!!!! I love it!!!  First of all I went there with a friend and she said that you will love it and I am just going to order you drinks and food and just trust me!  I did it and I am so glad that I did!  She ordered me \"the pink drink\" and it was amazing!  I mean I got a buzz off of it...maybe because I had not eaten anything all day and I was saving up for this great meal!  I finished it and it was on to the next one...and she ordered me a \"maid in mexico\" at this point I felt amazing!  We had the potato fritters and the soft pretzels with the cheese fondue!  I could have just eatne that!!!  OMG!!!  I did not want these appetizers to end...I told my friend that we just needed to order those again for the rest of our meal!!  She was like no you have to try the jambalaya!  I gave in of course...I was feeling too great from the drinks to argue and I love spicy food!  They brought the jambalaya out and I was in heaven!  I was spicy...spicy...and spicy!!! YUM YUM YUM!! I wish that it would not end!  It was so flavorful and delicious and I literally licked the bowl clean!  I also had another \"maid in mexico\"....then we split the peanut butter cup and gelato!!! OMG!! I wish this place was closer but its right downtown and it is in such a great location and its perfect!  Our server was awesome and just kept it so fun and fabulous the whole night! I will be back and I want this to become a regular place for me!  This is great for a date or for a group of friends!  I love it and I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"We left the Arrogant butcher because of the supremely poor greeting and treatment from Rachel. We were enjoying the CFP experience and checked in for dinner. There was a wait and we were told they would text us when a table was available. When we received the message our foursome had become separated and I raced in to confirm our table and request a moment to retrieve our gang. I was told by an unnamed female assistant at the receiving station that we would be seated or next in line when I returned with my crew. When we presented to Rachel within 10 minutes she told us we missed our table and we would need to get back in the queue. When I pleaded my case about waiting, texting and gatherings my party she just shrugged with a sarcastic smile and told me that it was their policy to sacrifice our position if we were tardy. And she claimed that she had just sent her assistant home and therefore unable to confirm my claim. I politely encouraged Rachel to examine their texting history to see when we were contacted. My suggestion was not appreciated and we told again by the unfriendly Rachel that we would just have to get back on the wait list. No apology. No smile. I sure hope that Rachel was more polite to the Alabama and Clemson visitors. We left the neighborhood to dine at the culinary dropout where we spent our cash."}
{"text":"To start I can say that the service was very good on a packed Saturday night.  Attentive, without being overbearing and shared. The salmon \"rilette\" was basically just salomn and mayo (with good bread). My scallop entree had enough well seared scallops to make me happy,  but was supposed to come with Brussels sprouts and if there was more than one on my plate I missed it somehow.  My boyfriend seemed to like his chicken with crab and generally the whole meal more than me. Overall, a nice patio downtown and close to things, but overpriced with disappointing food."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Definitely nothing to write home about. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was just average."}
{"text":"Wow, I just walked in here sat down at the bar.... five minutes later I walked out.   The bar tending girl half heartedly says hi after I did, then walks away.... pretty tattoo boy standing in front of me wiping out a glass never makes eye contact or acknowledges me in any way. Across the bar from me, stands two female servers chatting up a storm, the dark haired one glances over then continues talking apparently blinded by her ridiculous fake eyelashes. The female bartender walks past again as if I wasn't there. There are a total of 2, that's ' two' others at the bar... the place is empty and apparently no one cares about serving a middle aged, balding patron without visible tat's. I could have look past it all if it hadn't happened the last time I was in about 6 mos. ago. It's a shame management doesn't notice. No one in the restaurant would have known any different if I hadn't said something to yet another server blonde and hostess on the way out. To their credit, they were both apologetic... \"let me buy you lunch\".... \"thanks, but I just ate\". Thank god there aren't mirrors in there."}
{"text":"I finally got to eat here. I was not disapponted either. The ribeye was devine & the potatoes delish & my grilled asparagus also good. Wish there had been more veg but hey I like veg's what can I say? The hubs had the filet & he enjoyed it too but he was a bit jealous of my sides as he didn't get any potato so I totally shared.  The drinks were great too. I will be back & thanks Arrogant Butcher for the yummy date night dinner."}
{"text":"Wow ordered the butchers platter and large enough to share.  The cheeses and meats and olives breads.  Had the Maid during happy hour, made me very happy."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with Arrogant Butcher! I the fox restaurants but never had gotten around to coming to this one. I had an oyster craving so we decided to check it out.  It's located in City Scape which is convenient and easy to find compared to other downtown locations. We were able to park in the garage which was a very short walk away. The only downside was that we forgot there was a game that night in downtown... well actually two games. So the parking prices were changed to $20 due to the events.  I got a reservation through their website on OpenTable and our table was ready the moment we arrived. There appeared to be about 3-4 groups waiting. The ambiance inside was super charming and I loved looking at how the place was designed. Such fun furniture pieces and lighting. They had several Tv's showing the games but they were not obnoxious or distracting. It blended in nicely.  Our server was personable. I got two oysters (I told you I had a little craving for them!) And a half pound of crab legs. I requested them to be steamed. I loved that you could order the oysters by the piece. I'm not sure if it's because I was craving them THAT bad or because they were THAT good but man oh man those were the best oysters I've ever had. I was in heaven. The crab came with cuts so you don't have to try to get the meat yourself. It was a win win for me.  The Arrogant Butcher will definitely be included on my rotation of restaurants. Look to reserve a table online, and keep in mind if it's a game day if you want to avoid paying overpriced parking!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here over 3 years time. I have ordered the pretzel with fondue each time, this year the fondue was thin and soupy. Maybe because it fell in the happy hour range and the extra 5 bucks of cheese was waiting for post happy hour patrons? Who knows. For entree ordered the short rib stew and this dish is by far my favorite. It has a nice heat to it without being too hot, the spices really compliment the whole dish and it has a thinner texture than most stews which makes it more enjoyable. The corn muffin was to die for, can you say butter butter butter? Overall the server was friendly and attentive. But what is with the sorority of hostesses up front who have attitude? Be nicer to your walk-ins and offer them a place to wait instead of dismissing them when you get the mobile number, it would make the first impression more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed with this restaurant. Me and 3 other ladies were serving jury duty and decided to eat here. We made it aware to the server that we were on a time crunch and she was extremely professional and have us perfect service. The grilled salmon that I ordered was cooked to perfection with a juicy pink center my only issue was that the portion was extremely small compared to a salad with salmon. And my favorite cocktail was their polish fix with vodka, lime juice, and muddled berries. I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I had invited my son  and his friend. Previously when they had happened upon this place , upon entering, they were told that Tilted Kilt was upstairs almost like they didn't belong there. That definitely gave me incentive to go just to see what would happen.  So that most definitely put a bad taste in my mouth initially.  The space is very nice... The food average. It was basically  overpriced & I just have issues with making up descriptions of food..When I asked the waiter to explain some of the menu items it was awkward. When I read a menu I want a straightforward description of what I'm getting.  for the amount of money we spent there was extremely disappointing. However the service was great. I like the open kitchen I always like that in restaurants. Watching the guy cleaning the ceiling while food was being prepared was an interesting event. Wondered about that. Other than a drink before an event or an appetizer probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Well Sam Fox your Arrogant Butcher made me a happy bitch! My hubby and I were downtown for a meeting that ended early so we took advantage and had a quiet dinner on a Thursday.  Let me say that the restaurant is very trendy looking, what I like to call classic Dallas.  I like the style of most of your places they are all inviting.   What I liked, it was a Thursday at 7:15 and with no reservations we had a table in minutes.  We were at an event with apps before hand, so we passed go and went straight for dinner.  Turkey sloppy joe is so good it should be in an Adam Sandler song! Love that roasted pepper on it.  Second, thank you for letting me substitute my cheese on the burger for cowboy creamery (which is indescribable).    Why your better than most, home-made chips and potato bread buns.  I also enjoyed the La Jota wine by the glass, was tasty with the burger.    Why I can't yet give you a five, servers need a bit more polish when the hubby doesn't eat cheese b/c he doesn't like it we are specific when ordering NO cheese.  If you don't write it down, you better get it right or should I say write. Hostesses need uniforms, they are cute and young but thier tiny skirts were making even them pull and tug at their own clothes.   Coleslaw is a little sweet, and I need to make another visit to check price point and some other items on the menu.    Overall, very excited about another visit and I love this location."}
{"text":"Good place to have an impromptu meeting with a few coworkers over appetizers!"}
{"text":"This place gets WAY more hype than it deserves. The food is Oh..K and the service is absolutely atrocious. The service was so bad someone from my party went to the bar to grab our drinks because it took about an hour to get 4 cocktails out.   The appetizers are really heavy, and are likened to glorified pub food. The entrees were so mediocre I don't even remember what I had now only a week later.   This place would get 2 stars if only based on food and service, but it pathetically redeemed itself by actually having a nice patio and ambience inside, that it's a shame it can't get the foundational things right."}
{"text":"I never met this rumored arrogant butcher. But I did check this spot out for lunch with a group of 8 travelling coworkers. Had something called the Steak Cobb Salad and it was good. Large enough to make a meal.   A few others had the burger and it looked tasty as well.   This is a nice, spacious restaurant with a separate party room in the back.   Best of all? The name of the place is easy to remember.   Still never met any arrogant people the whole time..."}
{"text":"Love this place! A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink! Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations. On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips. Zero disappointment."}
{"text":"So I went here for a featured event. That need to be stated, because it is integral for my conclusion.   As I walked in I felt a good vibe over this place. They have indeed taken a name that screams of some kind of brandishing, but I do not know exactly what. The personnel was nice and quickly showed me where I belonged. This nice approach and courteous behavior stayed with me and my party the whole time.  There was pretzel balls and melted cheese on the table. I am no fan of pretzels and cheese, as many other are, but this fakery of cheese product deserves a mention. It was really tasty, surprisingly so. The pretzel balls was all right, but became a weapon of carboliciousness when paired with this mystical melted cheese product (I say cheese product, because there is no was actual cheese can melt in this fashion).    Then a basic salad, before I had the Sweetpotato Tortellini. It was a small serving of filled pasta that came to my table, but it was worth it. Quite delishious, even if surprisingly sweet. i would eat this again, but not if I was really hungry. But since I started with lots of pretzel balls - it was very adequate.   Dinner warounded of with a Salted Caramel Pudding, and a super lemony Gin and Tonic. The SCP was ok, tasty but as pudding always become blase after a while. It is a delishious dessert that saturates the need for sweets quickly. The lemony Gin and Tonic was refreshing, I am not sure how they made it so lemony (because just adding lime or lemon wouldn't add a subtle sweetness).   So the food was nice, and tasty even if I wasn't blown away by it. What I was blown away by was the service. Our server had many people, and yet was very attentive and super nice. Also working for uncertain tips since it was a featured event. That makes his effort worth much more in my eyes. i would go back, for the food.. but even more for the service. Very nice."}
{"text":"High energy, limited but imaginative menu. Second time, first was at the bar. The bar was packed and slower service, even with 3 bartenders, than the restaurant. Food ranged from good scallops to very good pork carnitas to great burger and the service was very attentive and upbeat even on game night with a large party."}
{"text":"Colleague and I went for lunch. This was a trendy place. Hostess opened the door for us. Waiter immediately serviced on drinks and info on menu items and specials.  Ordered smoked salmon rilette for appetizer. It was delicious, however the grilled bread was too hard to chew.  Ordered the turkey sloppy joe. Ground turKey was a good value, very saucy and flavorful. Wait staff was busy but made time for refills and condiment needs.   I would recommend going just before the rush weekdays to get an immediate table, especially if you are not within walking distance. They validate parking too."}
{"text":"So, I was about 15 minutes late to my dinner date here (thus, missing happy hour) since its so hard to find.  And then even harder to park.  Then I had to walk a block.  I should have just rode my bike.  The atmosphere is very typical to other Sam Fox restaurants - loud, open, big pieces, attractive waitstaff, private rooms.  My party split a number of appetizers and I have to give a special shout out to the soft pretzels with fondu and home made chips with onion dip! Yum! Its dangerous having that many delicious carbs...  They only have one vegetarian entree - but several appetizers and salads could also appease a meat-free palate.  I ordered the sweet potato tortellini and it was divine! It so rich and buttery that I almost felt like I was eating a dessert - I didn't know that a sweet potato could literally taste so sweet! I'm glad that I split it with another person, because it would have been too rich to tackle on my own.   The kale salad was mediocre and didn't come with almonds as the menu said - but some other kind of nut.  I much prefer the kale salad at True Food.  After splitting 4 or 5 appetizers, and then dinner...there was no room for dessert.  I would come back here during happy hour for some drinks and soft pretzels!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check out Arrogant Butcher with a buddy of mine and I'm impressed. I definitely liked it better than I thought I would. We sat at the chef's table overlooking the hustling bustling kitchen, what a treat. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice, not too over the top and the service was great. It was a very laid back meal and experience.  We started out with the salumi and  a bleu cheese plate, both very good. The salumi was served with sweet mustard and crusty bread. The bleu cheese was served this jelly, It tasted kind of like raspberry. Both were verry good, and I think 5 or 6 bucks a piece. For my meal, I opted for two appetizers: Potato fritters with creme fraiche and truffles and the mussels with pork shoulder and pommes frites. Both dishes were awesome. Somehow, they managed to make the potato fritters super light and airy, out of this world. The mussel dish was great too, humongous portion of well cooked mussels in a killer broth. Add in a few Stella's and my total bill was around $50 with tax and tip. A little higher than I'd like for a quick stop in meal, but definitely well worth it. I'll for sure be back to try some of the other good looking items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. I got the meatloaf which was presented to me as a thick slice on top of some mashed potatoes. It was by far, the finest meatloaf I have ever had. The wait staff was very attentive, the atmosphere was happy, and with our reservation there was no wait for a table. I would definitely recommend coming here to anyone who likes to eat a hearty portion."}
{"text":"This place is honestly over-rate. I can't tell if it's gotten such great reviews because the AZ culinary scene has just started to become a thing and this was prob one of the first- or if it's just bc it's in a tourist section of town and has cool vibes. Either way, food is pretty mediocre to terrible. Chef's board is good, considering 90% of it is food other than meat and cheese. As for entrees, stick with a burger or meat- anything else will leave you severely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"So after hearing about this place and then reading about it in the latest Phoenix Magazine, we decided to give it a try with our friends.  We made a 7:15 reservation for 4 for a Saturday night.  By the time we left the place was hopping and crazy busy.  We started with a little salumi and Cowgirl Creamery Inverness (oh how I miss the bay and Cowgirl whenever I wanted!) as well as oysters for the ladies.  The jam with the cheese was delish and the mustard with the meat had a great kick to it.  They are not shy with the spice here!  And the oysters were meaty and divine.  I wanted more.. so many more.  Around the table we shared a bottle of the Chablis Chardonnay, which was crisp and refreshing, just what you need on a summer night in Phoenix.  Mains ordered were, short rib stew, salmon, jambalaya, and the bbq ribs.  All were enjoyed immensely.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, the stew was spicy and filling, the jambalaya had a growing heat to it (which my friend enjoyed, it just slowed him down), and the ribs disappeared so quickly I'm not sure my husband actually ate dinner. :P  The cole slaw that came with the ribs was yummy, as that's the only bit I got to try.  For dessert we ordered the blueberry cheesecake and the hot chocolate cake.  The desserts are served in little mason jars which makes the portion just right to share so you can get that taste of sweet.  The cheesecake with the graham cracker streusel with almonds was yummy.  And the hot chocolate cake's cream on top was very good and the cake was nice and moist.   We had a great time and we'd go back again with visitors or family.  They validate your parking and ours was free since the food came out so fast, we were in and out!"}
{"text":"I had the tabouli salad here over a year ago and when my boss said lets eat at the Arrogant Butcher that's all I could think of. I had it again today and again....Amazing! We topped it with this peanut butter dessert!! Can u say wow??"}
{"text":"Went with a colleague for lunch. You need to make a reservation, yes, even for lunch. There was a line outside but it was quick and we got seated right away. Staff was friendly. Waiter was attentive. We got our food right away.   We both ordered the salmon kale salad (it's not on the online menu) and it was good. Good size bowl of very bright green leaves, healthy looking. Got good chunks of smoked salmon and Marconi almonds. The cauliflower was well blanched. I can see why it was $15 - satisfying number of almonds and salmon, good size portion. I'd order it again.   We also ordered the montchevre and another soft cheese and the prosciutto. The crusty bread was good, with a touch of their mustard and the prosciutto - yummy. Bread with the montchevre and a hint of raspberry jam. Another winner. The only bad thing was we couldn't have wine with the good food - have to go back to office.   Great vibe, nice place to people watch.   I had ordered the salmon appetizer and the pretzel fondue at another occasion. The fondue was ok - nothing special but the pretzel was very good (soft in middle, nice chewy crust). The salmon appetizer was better - good combo of salmon, capers, diced tomatoes and the crusty bread was perfect.   Somebody else recommended the stew - I'll have to try that next time.   Good experience. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I dined at this spot for business dinner. It was lively when we got there, and a handful of people were waiting for a table. Since we had a reservation, we didn't have to wait but a few minutes while they got our table ready. The first thing I saw was a huge bar, equipped with a few TV screens for sports fans. They have lots of seating, goes all the way to the back. The booth seating at the back was larger than the typical four-people booth, it can comfortably seat up to six people.  We started off with a couple of appetizer to share; Crispy Shrimp and Spinach & Artichoke Dip. The Crispy Shrimp was was very tasty and addicting. The portion was a bit small, especially considering the price tag. The dip was pretty good too, and the chips were tasty!   For main, I went with Diver Scallops.  It was well made, high quality and I enjoyed every bite.   At the end, we decided to share one dessert. Our server told us that their desserts are easy to share, and most of them (maybe all of them?) come in a bowl or some kind of container. We went with Warm Peanut Butter Cup. When it arrived, I was surprised by the way it looked. It was whipped dessert, more creamy than mousse. Very peanut butter-y.   Our server, Logan was quite awesome. He was friendly and very informative, made us feel welcomed with a big smile. The service overall was very nice, all the staffs were polite and took good care of us. We had a nice dinner here, the price tag might be a bit high based on what you order, but the quality was also high. Definitely a great spot to get together with friends and family, or for a business dinner. Reservation is recommended with its popularity."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night with a group of 8, our server was not very good....forgot to bring drinks, argued when we said the salmon was over cooked. But the manager recovered by buying our apps and bringing one of each dessert for us to share.   Had the salmon, crab stuffed chicken, sweet potato tortelloni, mussels, and salads. The salads are big and they offer to split to make it more of a side salad. Pretzel fondue app and fried zucchini....delicious!!! Desserts were all good....would come back."}
{"text":"I was going to rate 4-Star; but No -- Absolute 5-Star Experience!! I had been planning to go here every time I'm at cityscape, but never did until today. My brother & I both Fully Loved our beer & burgers here -- and my craving for fresh baked bread (specifically pretzels!!) was finally satisfied in the most over-the-top way...... Better than I expected - and I had expected a Lot! :)"}
{"text":"Are we still in Phoenix? That is what you will think upon entering the Arrogant Butcher. This place is definitely first class with classy clientele to match. I met here with a group of fellow Yelper friends for Happy Hour dinning before the ballet and was pleasantly surprised I had never been here before. Since they were gracious enough to extend Happy Hour to the group I grazed my way through most of the appetizers and enjoyed them all! I really like their \"toast\" aka bruschetta offerings. I was even daring enough to try the chicken pate toast and was surprised at how flavor that one was, the pickled onions on top of it were sweet and crunchy perfectly contrasting the smooth and salty chicken liver! Yum! If you want to imbibe and don't  really enjoy the harshness of strong alcohol but want that \"lifted\" feeling I would highly recommend getting \"The Fix\" that baby is smooth! I could've drank those all night long but I'm glad I didn't because I surely would not have been able to walk to the car. All in all I'm glad Yelp turned me onto this place I will surely be back soon."}
{"text":"Love the warm pretzel bites and cheese; as far as I'm concerned, it's the best thing on the menu. I generally hate hip and trendy restaurants, but I would return for the pretzels and cheese."}
{"text":"remember, i'm a vegetarian so allow that fact to guide your critique of my review.  the cheese plate was good - served with big wedges of buttery bread. the chunk of cheese was really small though, and for $5 i would think slightly more was warranted.  the fried shrimp appetizer was good. little tiny shrimp served with a spicy aioli.   i ordered the kale salad for dinner. it was a nice size, served with a lot of roasted cauliflower, currants and hazelnuts although the menu said almonds.   it's a little pricey, but decent for the few items i tried."}
{"text":"It's a good spot if you're in the area and want to try something Fox, but as far as flavor is concerned, it wasn't worth the price. I was excited to take part in the newness, but it didn't make worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Went late on a Sunday so it was pretty empty and the service was great. We had a pretty large group. Everything we ordered was good. Pretzel rolls, fish and chips, burgers, Oysters were all good and the group was happy."}
{"text":"Salted Caramel Pudding!!! The highlight of the meal! Comes in a little glass jar, topped with a heaping mound of light whipped cream.  Make sure to push your spoon all the way to the bottom to get the pudding and when you get a spoonful of the salted caramel pudding with the cream it is perfection.  A combo of sweet, creamy and slightly salty with a smooth texture, reminiscent of creme brûlée.    Also had the Short rib stew which was overly salty, came with corn bread that was tasty but also salty.    Smoked salmon appetizer was good but wish they gave more bread with it.    Overall good meal, the dessert was memorable and I want to go back just for that Salted Caramel Pudding!"}
{"text":"I was going to give them 5 stars for the name alone, but the food was also good.  I was expecting rudeness, but they were actually nice people, too."}
{"text":"This review is for their happy hour. The lady friend and I stopped by on the way to the airport. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the carnitas nachos, a charcuterie board, and two local draft beers. Pretzels were nice but the fondue had the consistency of Elmer's glue (delicious glue). Carnitas nachos were wonderful and huge for a happy hour portion, and the charcuterie board, while lacking much charcuterie, had some wonderful local cheeses and accompaniments.   Our favorite part of the meal? $3 local brews. $3! This Californian is happy."}
{"text":"Went to the Arrogant Butcher yesterday and had a cocktail and a charcuterie plate. The food was good and the place appeared busy. I look forward to having their food on my next visit and really determining if they are leveraging off off of their location or whether their food really good. As a cook their dishes smelled good but my palate will be able to distinguish between my previous comment and the quality of their food. The bartender staff was very attentive and kept my water glass full and checked on me throughout my visit."}
{"text":"Went here because of all the amazing reviews but have to say our experience wasn't outstanding. Because I wasn't that hungry I only ordered a soup and when it arrived it was luke warm at best. My husband ordered a beer which we had to remind them twice about before it arrived. The staff were friendly and despite this I would probably go there again and hope that our experience was just a one off."}
{"text":"Spot on flavor and technique. Limited sampling of: 1. Roasted Tomatoes side - I had this as a starter and it was a perfect tease...right-sized portion and a tomato that combines the sweetness of a sundried tomato and the juiciness/flavor of a tomato that perfectly balances fresh and concentrated flavors. 2. Scallops - smoked cauliflower, peas, nuts and oranges...incredible balance of citrus, smoke and crunch that is all ridiculously fresh letting the flavors work.  If you like technicality the scallops were a  single-side sautée and were PERFECT!    Sorry for long review, I think I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive, but lovely food served in a fun atmosphere. Sit at the chef's counter and they will occasionally toss samples of food your direction to try, which was very entertaining."}
{"text":"Had lunch. The Short rib green chile stew is fabulous. Good reports on the jambalaya. Saw the pastrami pass by - looked delicious. We'll be back.   Don't order cheese - they serve it chilled. How can professional restauranters be so ignorant?"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites of the FRC. Although most Fox restaurants have the pretzels and fondue, the cheese at Arrogant absolutely surpasses that of the others!! I've been numerous amounts of times and the food always is good. The last time I went my boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get two seats along the bar of the kitchen. Its always so cool to see how the food is prepared. The guys on the line are so friendly and professional. They even threw us a few pretzels and dip just because. The servers are good but never worth remembering a name over. The management team runs a good floor but the kitchen staff deserves most of the credit for the dishes that they put together!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed, but I would return here if I were with others who wanted to go.  However, I would not go of my own volition and I really don't get the stellar reviews this place gets.  Yes, it is in a good location right in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  The atmosphere is pleasant and enjoyable.  But the food?  I found it to be overpriced for what it was.  The pretzels and provolone fondue? Meh.  That cheese is just nothing to write home about.  It may be provolone, but it just doesn't taste much better than what you get at a movie theater or Auntie Anne's.  For an entree, I had the Sweet Potato Tortelli.  I found this to be on the mushy side and quite bland.  I have a feeling this place does well due to clever marketing, cutesy name (sister restaurant is the lackluster Culinary Dropout which also carries those pretzels), and cool semi upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Amazing food, great and beautiful people all over this place, a server with the same Birthday as mine! What else could I possibly ask for??! Lovely inside or patio seating. Great mix of dishes and drinks! LOVE the Polish fix as a refreshing unwinding drink!!! Try the rock shrimp w/ shishito peppers or the Pretzel bits with fondue for your appetizer! Yum Yum!!! Nom nom!!  Oh and the Cubano, and especially the Turkey Pastrami are a must for lunch!!  Bon appétit!!!!"}
{"text":"What a yummy place! I really can't say enough good things about this spot right across from US Airways center. My Mom and I went here before a concert recently. I was able to make a reservations, which was super nice because we got in right away and the place was packed- it was awesome to just walk right in and be sat. I found the service to be quick and efficient, especially considering it was a very busy night.   The food is excellent... it is by far the best fox restaurant I've been to. Based on Yelp reviews we decided to split a couple things. We started off with the pretzel fondue and, like everyone else has said, it was BEYOND amazing. The pretzels were warm and fluffy and the cheese was sharp and tangy. Very, very good. We also shared a salad, which was fresh and tasty. Then, we had the green chili with a fried egg on top it was spicy, but the corn bread on the side was sweet so the combo was unbelievable. I would surly get it again.   Arrogant Butcher did NOT disappoint. I was so happy to get to try it and even happy with the amazing food and service we had. I will be back next time I am downtown and I will for sure being the Hubs... he'll LOVE it!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place after having an amazing experience at Culinary Dropout. Its downtown and in a niche little area. We sat outside and I really wasn't a fan of the decor. It seemed kinda all thrown together and not really thought through or maybe that is what they were going for here. Regardless, the food. Well its just mediocre at best. We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue (just okay, I could make better fondue at home) my husband got the stew (he said it was eh just okay) and I got the chicken stroganoff (had no flavor).   While the food was barely okay, the service was great! And everyone seemed to be having fun so it was just an \"okay\" night."}
{"text":"My experience entailed an absolutely amazing waitress she did everything right and was extremely pleasant. My food.. Over 60 minute ticket time, under cooked steak and a sent back soup. Super under portioned as well.    Great service. Over priced. Food at Tilted Kilt up stairs is the same quality and cheaper.  I wouldn't waste your time, Fox Concepts let me down consistently."}
{"text":"Terrible. Save your money and eat somewhere else. Oysters were full of shell fragments, they served with a nasty green sauce... Cocktail sauce is the gold standard guys, don't get creative.   Had the beef stew which was very average, and my friend had the crab stuffed chicken which was dry and boring. Even the drinks were boring. After school special is a nasty ass drink, it's like a nasty version of a michelada, I didn't think it was possible to make modelo taste bad, but this place found a way to do it. Worse of all, they saw that I only took one sip out of the drink, and didn't offer to take it back or exchange for something that didn't taste like garbage... Seriously 90 dollar bill for a place that has slightly above average buffet quality food.... No thanks"}
{"text":"Hate this place. Overpriced, food is 'good' but not as good as the arrogant butcher seems to think. Small portions. Place is noisy. And snotty people. I've been twice and had the same feeling both times. It gets two stars only because the waitress was very pleasant. Would not go back, but I'm under no illusions that the \"elite\" who want to \"name drop\" think it's a great place, so my business won't be missed."}
{"text":"I have been here now a handful of times and I fall back in love each time! The butchers board (or chefs board?) is honestly a must every time! It's full of meats and cheeses and bread and olives and everything delicious! Bacon wrapped sweet potato bites? Yes please! Also the salmon mixture on the board is so delicious! I would buy that by the jar if available! Great atmosphere, excellent service and just delicious food. Do yourself a favor and stop by for at least an appetizer and a drink."}
{"text":"We have heard a lot about this place and were finally able to go.. Service was friendly and fast and food was good. We got the jambolaya and the fish and chips which were both really good. The best part of our meal was the dessert.. We got the salted carmel pudding and it was sooo good! We would go back just for that dessert! Everything tasted nice and fresh it was excellent."}
{"text":"Had the salmon kale salad. Nothing special, just mediocre Solomon with some cut up kale and almonds.  Very slow service at 3:00 pm as well."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here today. Overpriced crap in a cool location. To start off Our waitress was obnoxious and pushy. She kept coming up and bothering us and interrupting conversations when we hadn't even had a chance to look at the tiny little menu. I got the special corned beef sandwich which was not good at all, cold caramelized onions and stale bread that was completely soggy in the middle when it came out. My girlfriend had some sweet potato ravioli which I didn't even want to try, it had no sauce and a few gross looking mushrooms. After food the waitress kept bothering us, it was clear she wanted us to leave so we did without getting any more drinks."}
{"text":"Best French dip I have ever had. It was so good. The hummus and cheese are awesome too. The staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Solid food, drinks, vibe, and service. One of my issues with ordering nachos in a restaurant is distribution of ingredients and toppings across the chips. Most restaurants pile the chips and you get a few loaded with toppings and a majority of plain dry chips underneath. I'm happy to report that this is NOT the case here. Great nachos! Goat cheese stuffed peppers are great snacks, the devilled eggs with crispy prosciutto were excellent, and even the chopped salad (which typically means boring) was above the bar. Nice vibe not only from the setting but all the staff seem to be having a good time and were yet very attentive."}
{"text":"Another top notch Fox restaurant. They do have the formula down. I cant say this place is anything really incredible or unique. But what it does it does very well. Its affordable. Its very trendy. The quality seems to be top notch. Service was excellent. Our dessert came out approximately 5 minutes after we ordered. It was delivered to us by the manager with apologies that it took so long and it was on the house. We had the warm peanut butter cup. I'm not a huge dessert person, especially chocolate ones, but it was good. The cookie on the side really deserves to be broken up and tossed in the bowl with the gelato. Getting back to the beginning of the meal, we had an appetizer of bacon potato fritters. They are amazingly light and airy. The taste of bacon was only slight. Everything is better with bacon right? The entrees were order were the ricotta dumpling bolognese and the meatloaf special. The dumpling were great. Again light and airy, almost slightly dry. A tad more moist and they could be gnocchi. The bolognese sauce were fairly oily. Most likely from the fat rendered from the cooking of the ground beef. I do think of myself as a meatloaf expert. I'm not easy to please. It was made perfectly. A perfect sweet glaze on top and a moist tender center. Nothing cutting edge with this. Just the basic meatloaf but done well. The mashed potatoes were a let down. I prefer my mashed potatoes on the rustic side. These were obviously whipped in some type of food processor. They get a slightly gluey texture when processed. We had a bottle of Stronghold Nachise with dinner. A great pairing for what we had. I was impressed they dont gouge you on wine prices. Their markup seems to be a more reasonable 100%. I've seen many places triple and quadruple the retail price of a wine. So kudos on that. I would def go back, but not right away. There are so many other places to try yet."}
{"text":"If you go with an empty stomach, you can probably justify three courses- all of which are delicious. Waiting staff know what they are talking about so you can trust their opinions. Drinks are pretty potent. Easily the best place to go to before you go to a Suns game (the restaurant and the arena are next to each other).  Recommended dishes: crab stuffed chicken, sweet potato tortelli, peanut butter cup."}
{"text":"The menu made me go WTF but the taste made me go OMG. (that was a HORRIBLE joke I'm so sorry I left this in the review.)  This is a must stop if you come here to Phoenix. In my opinion its the best restaurant in DT with out going crazy upscale. They have sports, have a bar, and comfortable dim lit seating for a great night of conversations and company.  Family style this place and get a few appetizers. The nachos are average. Pretzel Bread with Cheese Fondue was DANK. Hummus was DANK. Oysters were DANK. My favorite was the cheese fondue tho. Perth scallops were big pieces and juicy. Pops in your mouth.   I HIGHLY recommend this place. Come here and show your friends you know cool spots in DT PHX"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! The sweet potato tortellini was amazing! Perfect portion size and service with a smile."}
{"text":"While visiting the city I was excited to try this place out. So my review is as disappointing to write as it was to have personally experienced. I just really thought after reading the reviews first that this place was going to knock it out of the park.       After arriving, we were told that there was a large party in the back and that they were not seating people until the kitchen could get caught up. We were a party of two with no one else waiting. So ok, no problem we'll just grab some drinks at the bar and wait and she says she will come get us as soon as they start seating again.      Well, after 30 minutes in and watching not 1 and not 2 but 3 different groups come in and get seated in various locations we decide to go reestablish that we are indeed still waiting in case she thought we left and were told they could get us in 15 more minutes.       Fast forward now we are seated and have ordered. This place is so loud. I mean I get that it is what it is but my goodness, i felt like we were shouting during our entire meal and speaking of the meal. It was just so-so. One meal was the the filet mignon.....meh.. and the other was the diver scallops also meh...should have just stayed at the bar, speaking of which craft beer selection was very nice and staff very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We had great service- thank you Ian! He had great recommendations for beverages and food.  The meatloaf was very good and large sized.  Fish tacos were flavorful and seasoned well. I loved the Mediterranean salad with chicken added. Ian helped make the dinner fun and food well timed."}
{"text":"They have private rooms! Went on a Sat night for a Birthday party for 22, and can I just say I felt the service far exceeded our expectations for a Sat night AND a large party! Alex S. was one of two servers for our group, and my hubby and I felt like we were the only 2 in the party! He was so attentive and very accommodating to everyone in our party...and did it all with a smile and a great, fun attitude!! Love him! The other wait staff was just as wonderful!! What a bonus to the amazing food! The pre-selected menu was deeeelish! Everything served was beautifully prepared, perfect portions, so fresh, so tasty, so delectable! The chef did an AMAZING job! Again, for a large party you don't expect much, but we were so impressed with Arrogant Butcher's stellar service and quality, scrumptious food...we are definitely coming back and spreading the word! Being there for a friend's birthday was special enough, but a BIG THANK YOU to the chef and wait staff (Alex S!!) for making it a pretty incredible dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Experience the Downtown hipster vibe with the typical transformed warehouse theme. Food is a bit paculiar. Creamed corn topped with scallops? My husband said it was good. I had The salmon. It was over charred, and the sauted vegetables were lacking in their mustard cherry sauce. The service was the best part, excellent."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite! We love the place..food is wonderfully prepared staff is great! Celeste our waitress was phenomenal as is the entire crew. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Love the selection of cheese and charcuterie to start. and the olives are delicious as well. They have some tasty and creative house drink options. i go for anything that contains whiskey, so i was happy. The entrees were a good size, a fair price, and tasty. And the blueberry cheesecake dessert was delicious. Thanks for the fun meal!"}
{"text":"In agreement with other reviews, I have mixed feeling about this place. The weak point, the service. We had got our appetizers and five minutes later they brought the entrees while we where half the way through the appetizers. It was obvious we were still working on our starters, four half full plates of cheese and prosciutto. Instead of taking the entrees back to the kitchen, he dropped them on the table and left. One of the entrees was a ribeye, our cutlery was not replaced and had to ask for a meat knife, which tool me five minutes because none of the waiters was paying attention. The steak was nicely cooked, but having to leave half dish of a beautiful prosciutto on the plate or else the meat will get cold is not a good experience."}
{"text":"love this place before an event downtown!  Always lively, friendly staff.  They have the yummiest seafood appetizers.  My go to when I'm in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great staff, great food, great great great!  We made a reservation with Maria, the nicest hostess ever! Then Our waiter, MIchael, was amazing and friendly and super-attentive. Then the manager Jamie was so polite and nice and even stopped by the table to check on us and wish us a happy anniversary!  Also the food was amazing. Get the prime rib!  We had an amazing time overall and will absolutely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Fresh oysters, shrimp appetizer, sweet potato tortellini. But then the charcuterie with fresh 'crunchy' bread came out. It was the worst bread. It was like day old bread that had been left out for 2 days. When I mentioned it to the waiter he assured me it was fresh and just cut. I love bread and it can make or break the dining experience for me. It was awful but to be fair everything else was really good."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to say that I was so very let down by this place. It was on my book mark list a while with so much talk of it and enticing pictures and when I finally went, it was a big ol flop.  Our server was nice enough. We sat outside since the weather was nice on a Sat afternoon.  Our party of 4 was ready for lunch and we happily ordered what sounded like great food choices. Jambalaya, Meatloaf, fish and chips and the French Dip. I personally had the fish and chips and they were very tasty, the rest of the dishes were very middle of the bar, nothing impressive, nothing to write home about, nothing to crave another day.   The meatloaf, I tell ya, was squishy, wet and so bland... She had to send it back, it was very unappetizing.  I would say the portions were stingy. There were maybe 7 green beans on top of the meatloaf? My bowl for the yummy fish and chips dip was not even filled, just a little squirt in the tiny condiment cup. When I asked for more of it, I got the same miniscule squirt in another condiment cup. Sigh. The price of food relative to the deliciousness and quantity was very askew.  I love Fox RC, I frequent CD so very often and a few others.. This one is clearly not one I'll venture that far to revisit. There are so many other places to try nearby before I would want to go back. Sorry, it's the truth."}
{"text":"Loud and pretentious and a bit pricey for what it's worth. I had the babyback ribs and they were pretty good. Fries were ok. Coleslaw was great (so my girl said, I don't eat that crap). I was about to order the filet mignon but didn't, and I think that was wise because someone else at my table got one and it looked like a tiny 5 oz cut for $30+.   I was not very happy with the customer service, their waiters/waitresses were all over the map and not friendly. And what's with the little paper menus that look like they have been handed around to the entire world? They were dirty and caked in sauces and grime.   Martinis in Marie Antoinette Champagne glasses was a little odd as well."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher is located at City Scape in downtown Phoenix. They have a large selection of wines, beer, cocktails and daily specials.   My favorite plate so far is the sweet potato tortelli with mushrooms, spinach and hazelnuts.  I enjoy from the raw bar the oysters & king crab legs. Also you should try there baby back ribs and zucchini fritters.  Mi Vida Mi Vida cocktail Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I feel as though they do not have many food options. And only four desserts. The ribs were alright but they weren't great. The chairs outside seats were in the shade when we got there but the sun started hitting us like 20 minutes later, once the sun hit the heat was horrible. They didn't offer any shade."}
{"text":"So, the first time I tried this place for lunch on a Tuesday in July, it was going to be a 20+ minute wait for 2.  But, I went back a few weeks ago and was seated immediately for lunch at 12:00pm (for 2).    I think lunch is a bit overpriced for what you get.  The fresh pumpkin soup (which changes daily) was absolutely delicious ($7)!!  But, I also got some oysters ($2.50 each, which is fairly normal).  Oysters were okay.  Disappointed that there were no crackers.  Very west coast.  Also, no horse radish!!   My friend got a prime rib french dip ($16).  He didn't seem to care for it, and I brought half home to my dog.  The french fries were nothing to rave about.    I might try them again for dinner, but overall I expected more after dropping a total of $50 for lunch."}
{"text":"Location, decor, service were all very good. We were asked if we had reservations at lunch time (which we didn't) but we were able to be immediately seated inside at a long table with other parties. We started with the pretzels and fondue which was tasty but not unique. I went with the charcuterie board with hot coppa and montchèvre with a side of grilled asparagus. Again, all good but not unique. Prices were moderate. I think the drink menu was longer than the food menu. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return here but certainly wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a busy night but the restaurant takes reservations so we got our table right away. We ordered 2 appetizers - the cheese fondue w/pretzels and the crispy shrimp. While the crispy shrimps were tasty, they were really greasy but came with a decent dipping sauce. The pretzels were also okay .. a little dry. For dinner we ordered the fish & chips and another dish that I can't remember the name of - both were not too bad ... We had a lot of leftovers. I had heard a lot about the salted caramel pudding so even tho we were really full from dinner, we ended up getting that. I would say that this was the best part of the entire meal. The pudding was really creamy, smooth, & tasty. I'd definitely go here just for dessert & order that!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch, we had the Cubano, beet salad, philly, oysters and our son had the Mac n' cheese.  All amazing!  Wait staff was great!  For a nice restaurant they were very happy to have kids and patient with them."}
{"text":"I was really surprised how mediocre the entire experience was for a Fox Restaurant.  The tables outside were more like being at a fast food restaurant.   No table cloth, no place mat.  The service was ok, not great and the food was not very good.  All considered, I would expect a lot more for the cost.  Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place.  The pretzel appetizer is the bomb.  We ordered that and another appetizer.  I always get the salmon entrée.  Not sure what is called on the menu.  It comes with little potatoes and a good sauce.  I have never had any of their desserts and might have to try one next time."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here prior to a local event for lunch. The staff were very friendly and helpful as it was our first time trying their restaurant. We had the BLT with fries which was amazing! My mom ordered the salted caramel pudding. It was very filling and the perfect consistency. I gave the experience a 4 star because the seating was awkward. We sat on the side by the bar where one side a was a booth and the other were single chairs. The chairs were several inches higher than the booth so it was a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, it as a great first experience."}
{"text":"This is a great place, especially for right before an event at the US Airways Center or another nearby venue.    The service has been great both times we were here.    The food is delicious.  Our favorites are the Zucchini Fritters, the Minestrone Soup, and the Salted Caramel Pudding.  Prices were a little more than we expected, but overall this was a great spot for dinner."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Arrogant Butcher. The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is in a great location if you are out and about downtown. I thought the menu was a little limited so make sure you check it out beforehand to ensure there is something you want. Our server was not quite as attentive as I would have liked. We had empty drink glasses a few times and had to ask for refills. My husband's food came out a good 5 minutes after everyone else's so we were left sitting awkwardly while our food got cold since his hadn't arrived yet. The desserts were great and not too large so don't feel guilty about getting one! I would come here again and just have proper expectations about what to expect."}
{"text":"We (3 adults) had dinner here on a Saturday evening prior to a D-backs game. Although we enjoy most of the Fox Concepts restaurants I was hesitant to dine here due to the mixed reviews. When we arrived the bar was packed and very noisy. Our reservations were honored on time and we ate in an attractive, quiet room filled with Arizona memorabilia. One in our group had the prime rib special, which he said was excellent; another had the Smoked Salmon Rillette, which was good but had hardly any salmon in it (disappointing) and I had the hamburger which was delicious and perfectly prepared.  Our server, Mark, provided upbeat, attentive service (unusual in restaurants anymore). The Warm Peanut Butter Cup dessert was a lerdown. It was like a warm peanut butter soup and way too sweet. The cookies with it were stale. The wine selections were pricy but that is common at most of the Fox Concepts restaurants. All in all, we enjoyed out meal and would probably return."}
{"text":"Met friends for a large group luncheon. Had a room to ourselves and the service great. I had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and it was very good. Friends had the Green Chile Stew and they raved about it. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've gone here to try their fried chicken and it's not on the menu. Apparently, the menu changes on a daily basis. Both times it was a Saturday early evening between 5-6pm. Long island iced tea was pricy but very well made. The pretzel bites were just ok this time around. Lacking the delicious flavor they had on my 1st visit. Probably will not try this restaurant again because of my two disappointments on both occasions."}
{"text":"Great prime rib, perfect location by the light rail and stadium."}
{"text":"Pass on this place- bad food, overpriced and pretty sub-par service. Better places to eat in downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"The drinks are great and the service is fabulous. I give it three stars just because the food was \"okay.\""}
{"text":"Amazing food!  We went on Easter Sunday, and it was great.  Cocktails were strong, pork nachos were!  We had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"Visited AB for the fifth and final time tonight. Food was the usual standard and average. Service was horrible! At the beginning the female waitress was very attentive. During shift change the service spiraled down considerably.   I travel for a living so I'm constantly in and out of new places. My honest honest opinion of AB is that they complacent.   I went to the restroom and returned in 3 minutes and the bartender threw my full drink - I called this to his attention and he appeared annoyed to which I escalated my demand for the refulflment of my drink.  This led to an altercation which I can only attribute to the fact hat I'm a black guy visiting Phoenix - I honestly don think that I was black with virtually unlimited credit.  I think the owners of this establishment and it's group if establishments should seriously reconsider the bartender and management staff.  As Phoenix grows more diverse downtown they may want to join along!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Dinner seemed to take forever (2 hours) and our server was absent for a lot of it.  Pros: The charcuterie board was good. Made a reservation on the way to the restaurant just in case it was super busy (there was a Suns game) and were seated right away, even though our entire party wasn't there so that was also a plus. Cons: Oyster shells in the shucked oysters - sent them back.  The manager came over and apologized so that was nice. Dry burger - ordered it medium, came out well done. Wrong beers delivered second round.   Not a great experience. I had been wanting to go for awhile so at least I can say I did, and won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times... it's a good reliable place when you're in downtown Phoenix. Food is good, you can't go wrong with the pretzels and fondue... or The Butchers Platter. Service this time was great - we had a guy named Jonathan who went out of his way to make sure the drinks kept flowing and that we were having a great time... and he gave one of our group a sketch that ended up being a story that we'll tell for a long long time! Haha! What's also great is that the value is there for the price... the only problem is that we live a bit far from downtown and it's not really worth the 30 minute drive. If you're in the area though... definitely consider it as one of your stops during a night out... !"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a nice variety of uniquely prepared and great tasting food and drinks. The Filet is exceptional.  Beet salad is very good.  Blueberry cheesecake is outstanding.  Draft beer and whiskeys are excellent.   Service was great and prices reasonable. Fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... I really did..the only thing I liked about this restaurant is the design..it has a very cool and trendy vibe.  Service: The hostess was very rude, it looked like she was mad and had communication problems because we simply just stood there waiting for her to tell us how long the wait was.  A waitress finally took us to our table and literally threw the menus on the table and didn't say a thing. Then, another waitress brought us some water without a straw.  We had to ask another employee for straws which was kinda hard to do because it looked like all the waiters were busy walking back and forth even though the restaurant was not busy at all.  Then, ANOTHER waiter came to take our order, he was very nice and professional.  Food:  My friend order the Fish N Chips.. she said it was nothing out of the ordinary and it was definitely not worth the $17.  I ordered their cheeseburger with a side salad.  The burger was ok but it was again nothing out of the ordinary and it was a little cold.  The salad was HORRIBLE! I mean I don't expect a bar to have great salads but come on this salad looked and tasted horrible."}
{"text":"No no no, a million times NO! I did not enjoy it here. Very overpriced sandwiches, soft pretzels were NOT soft, and it was hard to get service (I was at the bar!) The only thing cool about this place was their flame under the cheese that came with the pretzels. I didn't even finish my food. If you're looking for amazing pretzels, go to Teakwood Tavern. Now THOSE are soft pretzels. If you're looking for \"gourmet\" sandwiches, you can find that at Jimmy Johns. Their service will be faster, they won't be as expensive, and their sandwiches will actually taste good. Sorry to be so harsh, but when I spot an almost 5 star rated restaurant on Yelp, I shouldn't have to be let down by several things. I rarely leave bad reviews but dang Phoenix, this place was a bummer."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. The service was good and the food was absolutely amazing. Definitely want to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food is mediocre. You'll be paying for the cool hipster vibes and not good food."}
{"text":"Went here before a show at Comerica. Parked in the garage attached - all was within easy walking distance. Parking was spendy ($24). Food was spendy. Service here was TERRIBLE. I dont know if our server was new (she was shaking, many of her words were inaudible, she down sold beer...) or what. I spent good money on appetizers and she removed them from the table before our food came out and without asking - this is not only rude, but a waste of $$/food. I should have grabbed it back or said something, but she was fast lol. Food was good. Beer was good. Overall a fun evening, but service will prevent me from coming again. There are lots of other options downtown."}
{"text":"While on a business trip, I stopped by The Arrogant Butcher for lunch. Had the pork cubano sandwich and fries and the proportion is quite generous. I've heard of this place and was recommended by several locals. The food is good and the atmosphere is very nice. Nestled in downtown, there are plenty of seating and it's right on the corner of one of the hottest spots right alongside Potbelly and Squid Ink. I didn't get a chance to try any of the other dishes, but will definitely be back next time I'm in town. Great little find in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before the \"I love the 90's\" concert and had a nice cold hefeweizen and a delicious  zuchinni fritter both were perfect. Service was good but you could tell they were doing a lot of side work before a baseball game and an event at the arena. We wanted to order more but the server presented the check and hurried away before we got a chance. She did not go to socialize or check her phone she was working with another table. I understand that \"turning and burning\" is the way servers can maximize their income but we still wanted to eat a little more. We have been back since and were treated excellent so I believe it is a one of event otherwise it would have been a 5 star place."}
{"text":"We like this place.  Usually stop in here once every year while I'm in town. Everything is nicely prepared and friendly service.  Not breaking any molds here, but service and food are consistently well executed."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour and they have some really good deals! Check out the HH menu on their site. Tried several of the apps (get the pretzel bites!) and had two of their HH cocktails. All good. Had a pretty rude bartender and an inattentive waitress, but they seemed like isolated bad eggs."}
{"text":"When you have 24 hours in Phoenix, you jump the yelp recommendations straight to #1. And that's exactly what I did.  My Uber driver told me that she gives tons of rides to this spot which made my excitement level jump to a 12 outta 10 (I think I found a winner)  I was seated right away outside with a beautiful view of the mountains. I ordered the smoked salmon as my starter and the 805 on draft.  It was great way to begin the meal. The brioche was drizzled with olive oil and the salmon could be easily spread across.  For my main entree I ordered the scallops. It took me awhile to decide on them as I had never had scallops before and just heard the sad stories of them being the overcooked and rubbery.  But I trusted their #1 ranking and went for it! They were spectacular, caramelized on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. They came with some roasted sweet potatoes and like a broccoli slaw, all with a reduction sauce. It was really nice.   The only thing that was keeping me from giving this a five star review was, as my name states I'm always on a hunt for a deal. I thought the portion of my scallops were a tad on the small side for what I paid for them and knew I would have gone hungry had I not ordered the starter.   But overall really a great place and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was on POINT from start to finish! From the hostess who was friendly and welcoming to Our server, Elecka, who was great and also made some excellent recommendations!  HIGHLY Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday dinner and finally made it to another Fox Concept restaurant! Woohoo!   Slow cooked Prime Rib: a Saturday only nightly special was cooked medium rare at one inch thickness and a deep dark pink with the most delicious side of horseradish dauphinois potatoes. Dauphinois is an origin of the French in what you may be  more familiar with the potato gratin. It's basically layered sliced potatoes with creme fresche and cheese with a bit of garlic and scallions. A version of a Julia Child type of dish. In Arrogant Butchers version I didn't really taste he horseradish which would have paired a little bit better with the prime rib. But either way it was quite exquisite and could eat a bowl full of it. $32  Grilled fish tacos:  was nothing but ordinary to me. It's made of grilled white fish, tomatillo sauce, avocado, pico de gallo and a side of white bean concoction. Still good but I could get the same elsewhere for a lot less. $17  Took a fellow Yelpers advice and parked in the Cityscape Parking garage and validated our ticket before seating. Otherwise it's $3 per hour.   All in all AB would be a swanky place for the meat lovers and a FC restaurant lover in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had a work dinner here and thought the atmosphere was pretty great, open floor plan with big bar in the middle. Great place to grab drinks and some finger food for sure. Staff was friendly and the place had a good vibe to it.  Dinner however, was just okay.   There were three of us and we ended up having to order two Charcuterie plates as the portions were pretty small (especially for the price when you pay a la carte for two meats and a cheese - over $20 a plate).  The waiter raved about the Beef Short Rib Stew, so two of us ordered it. Definitely fell short and was incredibly salty and lacked any type of texture, even with cornbread crumbled in it. Our other guest definitely enjoyed his Salmon entree.    With their pricing you'd expect more fine dining food quality then bar/bistro food, but in reality that's where this place is, upscale bar food that is overpriced."}
{"text":"Great food but the King crab (something extra in the butter sauce put them over the edge) and Polish Fix were my favorites. The Chicken stuffed crab was good, but needs more sauce and the Divers scallops were amazing!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location. Excellent service. My wife told the server how much she liked the salted caramel pudding and the chef came out and taught her how to make it! I have only had sandwiches here by they have been outstanding. Today I had the turkey pastrami, terrific! Prices are what you would expect to pay downtown at a good restaurant but the food and service keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Went here with the Husband on a Friday for dinner.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance.  For an appetizer we had the crispy shrimp.  I was really excited about the shrimp because I'm lowkey ALWAYS craving crispy fried shrimp and this place didn't disappoint.  Perfectly fried, seasoned, tasty batter, clean shrimp, and the peppers they served tossed in with it are fried as well and aren't super spicy.  For my entree I ordered more fried food....Dont Judge Me...I had the fish and chips and the fish was reeeally good.  Definitely recommend.  My Hubby had the Jambalaya, which he said was good, but could've used just a tad bit more seasoning...He still ate it all though and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We would have spent so much more money here had the service not been so bad. We sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. It was really hard to get any servers attention. Meh. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Fox is a genius. Never had bad service, staff so friendly and quality of food is top notch."}
{"text":"The pretzel and cheese appetizer was awesome! Service was awesome! Quick during a busy lunch. The hubby had pastrami sandwich which he loved. I had fish and chips. The fish was so greasy! I was really bummed! I would come back again to just try the appetizers which all Looked yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Favorite restaurant in Phoenix. We sat at the chef's counter and Jack and Dominic were awesome to \"hang\" out with. They introduced us to some great food. And of course, answered my many questions ;) and Kayla was great with her suggestions of the prime rib and the short run stew. Next up, dessert--second time ordering the peanut butter cup. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great service, yummy food!"}
{"text":"Perhaps one thing to keep in mind here is if you're going to visit a place called the arrogant butcher, they're probably not going to be known for their salads.   I tried the beet salad and my colleague tried the tabouli chicken salad and I can honestly say we were both underwhelmed. First off, the tabouli salad had lettuce, grape tomatoes, quinoa, and feta cheese...coming from someone who makes tabouli (and the proper way to make it by the way is with parsley, burghul, and diced tomatoes just to name a few ingredients), I can assure you this salad has nothing to do with the ethnically divine dish- I mean it's not even close to being its fifth cousin twice removed! As for the beet salad I ordered, well, it was more of a regular salad with a few beets. Generally, when I order a beet salad at most restaurants, the main ingredient is beets but in this case, it was mostly lettuce with a few pieces of beets here and there. Needless to say, we both agreed that if we were ever to come back, it would have to be for something off the butcher block.  One tip to keep in mind, the restaurant offers up to two hours of free parking (with validation, of course) if you park at the Skytower."}
{"text":"Ok so I wouldn't consider myself a food expert, but I eat out enough to know what's good, what's ok, and what's just out right a disappointment.  I was here for lunch with my bf and were ordered a few dishes just like we do at all the restaurants we go to. We had a the roasted beet salad, the wilted brown lettuce added no flavor to what could of been a great salad. Prosciutto that's supposed to be crispy seemed more like Bacon Bits.   Pass..  I decided for the grilled salmon as my entree, I've got to say that fillet was the driest thing I have ever had in my life. Just not good at all and the veggies they add to it did not compliment it at all.   To top it of service was horrible and there was a constant buzzing of flies.   Sorry Arrogant Butcher not coming back.   Ps. If you stay at the Kimpton ( that's how we heard about it) they recommend it all the time.  Kimpton stop doing that."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! I came in during a rush before a jimmy buffet concert. I almost left because it was so crazy. But I had heard such good things, so I found my way to the hostess. Who was so friendly and was able to seat me right away. I was a little disappointed because when I go out by myself I like to sit at the bar so I don't feel out of place at a table by myself.  I order an app and a drink which were both delightful. I explained my situation to my server Ryan and he found me a new seat at the chefs counter.  Every thing about my experience was wonderful. The guys on the line we So friendly and helpful, with pleasant attitude. The food and drinks speak for them selves. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great time with wonderful service."}
{"text":"Wow if not the best 1 of the best jambalaya's I have ever eaten. Definitely a place to come if u visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Booked our son's ASU grad dinner at The Arrogant Butcher for a party of 15. We had never been there, but it was recommended by someone at a different restaurant because we needed a nice but still casual place near the Diamondback Stadium.. (It is walking distance and great parking right across the street) This place was AWESOME!! They had our table set outside on their patio, which was perfect because the weather was just right. I honestly can't say enough about this place.. Started the evening with our waiter (Brent) He was very attentive to all our guest and had a smile the entire time!  He made sure everyone in our party had a drink in hand at all times, whether it was a cocktail/or ice tea. (excellent drinks by the way) We also ordered different appetizers, from the cheese platter to zucchini fritters & crispy shrimp. For dinner we all ordered something different. I had the grilled salmon, husband had the baby back ribs. Everyone's dinner came out quickly and nicely prepared. (the food was really really good) Our Waiter continuously checked on us to make sure everyone was doing ok. The level of service at this place is a 10+ There is NOT one bad thing I can say.. Our guest are still raving about this night. Grad dinner was a complete success! Thank you Brent, and The Arrogant Butcher!"}
{"text":"I love Arrogant Butcher - the food is delicious and the customer service is great.  I especially love the tortelli add grilled chicken.  And you have to save room for the salted caramel pudding - it's a must!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! There was a 45 min wait but we found seats at the bar and we were greeted by the bar tender right away. The drinks were tasty and we loved the kale salad and meatloaf. Definitely a great place to eat and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Saturday afternoon and sat at the chef's counter. Service was great all around, but Nick was exceptional. He was friendly and helpful. We ordered the Butcher's Platter and cheesecake for dessert. Yum! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can only rate this a four star because of the over priced food. Place is great, service is great, food is pretty good. But most items are overpriced in my opinion. I know this is a Fox Restaurant Concept but I still believe the other concepts have a better menu and better pricing. I would defiantly recommend this place to friends/family. Maybe next time I will try their cheese board."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  I'm obsessed with the kale salad and the filet.  Desserts are great too.   The staff here is THE NEXT LEVEL.   The first time I went here I was eating at a restaurant for the first time after a very strict diet due to being in treatment for disease.  I misunderstood the menu item I ordered and when it appeared I knew I couldn't eat it.   I HATE a-holes that send back exactly what they ordered, but I didn't want to risk my health progress or getting really sick in public.  SO... I just told the waitress (in a few words) my situation and she helped me special order something, no charge for what I sent back.  I seriously was mortified sending it back and she made me feel a lot better.   Since then I have frequented and I'm happy to order whatever I want.  It's all really delicious.  Even when they are super busy you get great service.  I can't say enough about this place, please go and experience it for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"The food is the best. Charcuterie board you can't go wrong. The raw oysters are huge and amazing. The salmon and the prime rib are divine. The servers are all very dedicated."}
{"text":"Very fun place. I had the scallops but my friends had the fillet and salmon. All were great and the portion size was just right!! Definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome meal here.  The pretzel balls are so good - you need to try them! We also had the rock shrimp which was amazing. I don't even like shrimp!  We also shared the fish & chips and they did not disappoint us either.    I tried the Peppers & Peaches martini and it sounds weird but was strangely good - I wouldn't drink a lot of them but 1-2 is fine.    Now I wish Fox would open one in Tucson so we don't have to drive all the way to Phoenix to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced but very good food. We had the charcuterrie board and a few small apps. The favorite part of the meal was the incredible house made mustard that came with the board!  Tip:If you're heading in on a Friday or Saturday, call or text for a reservation first."}
{"text":"I tried this yesterday for the first time with my inlaws....everything was AWESOME! Service, food, atmosphere....love it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband wasn't pleased with the size of his Salmon nor the size portion of the side - I however was BEYOND satisfied with my Turkey Pastrami! I will get that again!!!"}
{"text":"Good comfort food! Hit the happy hour from 3 to 6. The pretzels and provolone fondue are generous.  A couple of Moscow mules on the special followed by fish and chips. The tartar sauce is the best I've ever had. Some sort of chipotle influence."}
{"text":"Ok, so my wife and I have been coming here on and off for the last year, probably about 10 times. This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review.  I work in customer service, and have worked in customer service for about 20 years. Customer perception is reality. The girls at the hostess area/computer/thing just don't seem to have any desire to assist. My wife and I had a reservation tonight for 7:45. Our plans changed and we arrived early, around 6. We asked if we could be seated earlier, and they said no problem. Here it is, 7:05, and plenty of people have walked in and been seated after we came in. I walked up around 6:30, and they said it would be a \"couple\" minutes. As my wife and I sit here and see the empty clean tables, that have been empty and clean since we arrived, I myself am beginning to wonder if we slipped through the cracks or something. I must have forgot to take off my invisibility cloak or something. All 4 of these ladies are just standing there, talking and chatting, and help more people as they come in, and get seated. Needless to say, this is a pretty long review because I have lots of free time while I wait to be seated with my wife. At this point, looks like we are going to be seated at our original reservation time. Arrogant Butcher, you may have lost a loyal customer...... I started off this review with 4 stars, and have since dropped it to 2, as I'm sitting here, waiting to be seated..... UPDATE: Just moved it back to 4 stars, thanks to Alec (spelling) one of the managers, who personally came by our table because he saw this review on Yelp. I have to say, being a manager myself, it means a lot to face an upset customer, especially while they are still in the restaurant. Kudos to him, and the ownership for having him as a manager.  I did tell him that other than the initial aspect to our visit, everything else, from the wait staff, to the food, has been amazing. Thanks for helping us make our night of celebration easier."}
{"text":"Normally this place, being a Fox concept, has good service and food. Being there before a Dbacks game last night, however, they fell down on the job. Extremely busy and understaffed, we got there in time for happy hour, but didn't receive a happy hour menu, and no one came by. We waited and waited, and were able to only place one drink order. This took 15 minutes to come to the table. Some of our appetizers were missing. We ordered a smoked garlic toast, and it came in a mason jar of oil with some garlic in it.. and no toast. They were confused when we ordered toast for it, saying that was not how it was served. Um, okay. The salmon rillette was pretty decent, as was the provolone fondue with pretzel bread (served also at Cuilnary Dropout). But we were really disappointed. Zucchini was a bit on the soggy side (probably having sat for a while) and the hummus was mediocre. Have more staff on game days! The server was also incredibly irritating, rambling on about their oyster specials and all kinds of other things before we could even order a drink. We had to get a busboy to actually bring us our drinks in the end. Just unfortunate."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in Downtown phoenix, close to all the action."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Went and had the mussels w/ frites as an appetizer. I don't usually even like mussels, and I think I've fallen in love with these. I couldn't stop eating them--and the sauce, oh the sauces was amazing. Ask for some bread to soak up the sauce, you won't regret it.   I had the ribeye as an entree, and if you like your ribeye with some flavor, char, and a slight caramelization, this is the place. It was tender, juicy, and fantastically scrumptious.   Lastly, I had the hot chocolate cake. It was good, not great but good. I should have known better, I mean, its chocolate cake--nothing special.   I will be coming back Arrogant Butcher. You've stolen my heart and wallet."}
{"text":"Great establishment with good food. Pretzel with Cheese is a must here! Nice place to go on a weekend chill night."}
{"text":"Great place to go to after a show or game across  the street at the Talking Stick Arena.  Popular place with well presented delicious food."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. How did I not visit this place when I used to live here? This modern American place is amazing and a true gem of DTPHX. Our server Carrie was equally amazing. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The pretzels with provolone fondue were great! 11 pretzel rolls makes enough to share for an entire table. Carrie recommended an excellent wine to pair with my prime rib. She cleared our appetizer before our entrees and even asked when we'd like it fired - a personal touch I absolutely love. We were visiting a bit later in the evening, and Chef Robert came to explain that I would be receiving the last prime rib of the night and unfortunately could not fulfil my medium rare request. The meat was still delicious as a medium. Flavorful and seasoned wonderfully. My partner had the NY Strip, equally delicious as I sampled a bite. Kudos to FRC on this one. Will miss this experience when I head home. Photos of the pretzels but not of the prime rib, I was too excited to dive in."}
{"text":"Beef short rib stew w/cornbread,  Crab stuffed chicken w/spinach,  first time here and everything is great, very close to home and our bartender  was awesome, gave suggestions and pairings that were on point.  This will not be the last time here. Heard that it's great for Happy Hour, will be visiting and clise to Talking Stick Arena and The diamondback stadium.  Downtown Phoenix a hidden jewel in the desert."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! My husband and I have been here about 4 times and every time has been amazing. We only sit at the \"Raw Bar\" when we come. The guys behind the raw bar are so personable and make your visit special each time. They are actually one of the main reasons we keep coming back. I love this place, and we will continue coming back and telling others."}
{"text":"I love to come here! we usually only go for celebrations but it is tasty food! My husband always wants to order extra sides because the main course is never big enough for him."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was okay, but nothing really stands out. I felt it was also overpriced.  We ordered turkey pastrami and fish and chips.  I want to like the Fox Restaurant Concepts but it seems most that I have tried are appealing to the masses, lack originality in food, but have interesting decor.  While decor is important to a dining experience, I am there to eat.  Feed me something delicious for a fair price."}
{"text":"Our server was very kind and explained the menu well. Good food, and even better ambiance. Prices little high for lunch. Prices are more like for dinner menu. We were out for lunch and decided to give this a try. Server recommended it for dinner for next time.   Flavors were pretty good  - Jambalaya was an enjoyable spice. (Good kick) I usually don't eat foods with okra, green onion, or bell peppers but overall altogether it tasted great (Good flavors) - The Turkey Pastrami burger had a variety of flavors and a good meat choice! In my opinion, the coleslaw inside the burger was a downside of the burger; yet overall, would recommend!"}
{"text":"AB is one the nice places to go in downtown Phoenix with a group. Awesome pretzel bread and you have to try the blue berry cheese cake, outstanding!!!!!"}
{"text":"A place where excellent food meets excellent service. Loved the appetizers/extras and our main course! The butcher's platter is a tasty combination of cheese, meat, olives and yummy smoked salmon rillette. My favorite was the sweet potato tortelli. Any foodie would love this dish. A perfect blend of flavors...sweet potato, spinach, mushrooms, and hazelnut! YUM!!"}
{"text":"*Continue reading for sappy story  I needed to come back and write another review for yall and here's why: you are all spectacular. Every one of you. Every staff member I've encountered, everything on your menu, the atmosphere, every single thing. Even the things that I typically don't enjoy (your meatloaf is amazing and I hate meatloaf). On Yelp I am considered a regular at Arrogant Butcher because I stop by on a weekly basis (even though its usually just for your dessert 90% of the time). I always order the caramel pudding- I swear I tell everyone how amazing the pudding is and literally it makes me happy just to eat that lol there's crack in there, yall.   So I wanted to tell you what happened yesterday. I reached a really low point in my life (I will exclude the details), and I needed to get out of the apartment. I didn't want to be alone but I didn't want to call a friend and I was so upset that I was in tears. I pulled myself together and went downstairs to The Arrogant Butcher to make myself happy with that pudding again. I sat down outside by myself at a table for two within 5 minutes time even though it was clearly busy. My waiter came around and asked me what I wanted but I could barely speak words so I told him to surprise me with whatever dessert and whatever drink and he brought me the most thoughtfully created dessert platter- consisting of: Blueberry Cheesecake, Hot Chocolate Cake, and Caramel Pudding with a Blood Orange Paloma to wash it all down- it was a presentation! The platter had hand written labels differentiating the desserts with spoons to go along each and even a smiley face :)   The thing is that even though it was a busy time at TAB, they stopped at nothing to make me feel like I was the only person there, while simultaneously handling the busy crowd around me and I felt 300% better after leaving. I'm never going to stop coming here.  Dessert & Drink Details:  Blueberry Cheesecake: Cheesecake served in a mason topped with blueberry compote and graham cracker streusel. Hot Chocolate Cake: A warm chocolate cake concoction (I can't ever tell if there's caramel in the middle but it sure tastes like it and is amazing- perhaps just a really moist center?), topped with a homemade sweet vanilla whip (Chantilly). Served in a mason. Salted Caramel Pudding: A thick salty-sweet caramel flavored pudding topped with a sweet vanilla whip (Chantilly also?) and crack sprinkles, I swear. Served in a mason.  Blood Orange Paloma: A clever mix of a grapefruit flavored Izze (that's the spritz), blood orange liquor, lime, and tequila.   Love you guys."}
{"text":"The name sounded interesting.  I ordered an entree along with cheese appetizer while sitting at the bar.  Portions were ridiculously small.  Very disappointed.  The food taste was pretty average."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service.. they rush you...and food came out at all different times...go to Black Kettle Kitchen in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, and even better service! Nikki our waitress was very knowledgeable, and made great suggestions on cocktails, and dinner options. She even reminded us about happy hour! We had one issue with our sandwich being a bit dry, but Nikki took care of that for us right away. I expected the manager to come by, but pretty much stood around the hostess stand the entire length of our dinner. Forgot her name, but she has short dark messy hair. Regardless, we will be back for the great waitstaff."}
{"text":"Great food perfect location when seeing an event at Talking Stick Arena. Prices are on the high end a little. Overall I will be back."}
{"text":"Recently visited this place for lunch and was pretty satisfied with what The Arrogant Butcher had to offer. I have made it a point to try all of the Phoenix City Scape restaurants and become familiar with the lunch menus of these restaurants.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a graciously hip host who made us feel very welcomed. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty cool and the location is perfect for downtown lunch commuters.   I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and my friend has the cobb salad. The turkey pastrami sandwich was really amazing and the lunch portions were satisfying enough. I am not a big turkey fan but I will be calling this one of my all time favorite sandwiches, the coleslaw that accompanies that sandwich adds much need texture and is also refreshing. The fresh parmesan fries were great as well.  Plan on visiting this place during your lunch break if you have an hour or more. The place was not busy and it took around 25-30 minutes to receive a sandwich and a salad. This is the only reason why I did not rate a 5/5.   But overall great resaturant, good food, good prices, good ambience, good drinks, and great experience. Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"We really liked out entrees, appetizers, & beers! The fillet was very tasty & the sweet potato tortellini was amazing in its sauce! Those little pretzel bites with the cheese sauce were gone too! Finally, chocolate cake in a mason jar, oh yea!! Must have!"}
{"text":"went here with some colleagues based in reviews. so glad we did. food was amazing. service was good. wished they served coke. absolutely go again. short rib stew with fried egg - the ONLY way to eat short rib stew"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but this time I just realized that it's my last time. Either they've changed some flavor components or they've gotten lazy because things that I've had in the past (like the pork carnitas and the kale salad) that tasted fine were dry and bland. Maybe it was a bad night. But I only give a lower rating bc the last time I was here I thought similar things but thought it was an off night. I'm tired of paying higher prices for average food. My son also has a food allergy (fish) and they said they'd changed the oil to fry his chicken strips and fries, but it came out smelling and tasting like their fish and chips (and it wasn't just bc it was the same batter). But everyone else seemed to be having fun, so what do I know!"}
{"text":"Great service and menu.  We went on a Saturday night before catching a show downtown.  The atmosphere felt upscale/trendy with casual dining.  Great location and restaurant layout."}
{"text":"This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.  My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.  For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.  I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.  Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here."}
{"text":"Very good. Fun atmosphere. We got the pretzel bites as an appetizer and they were so good! We ordered the meatloaf as our main dish and split it, as our server recommended. The meatloaf was perfectly delicious, better than lots of other meatloaf I've had, but it was still meatloaf. Haha. I'm not sure why were expecting anything beyond that. We saw some of the other dishes that people around us ordered and slightly regretted our choice to go with the meatloaf. Again, there was nothing wrong with it, but we definitely could've ordered something more exciting. Next time!"}
{"text":"Park in the structure by the restaurant there is validation! The ambience is nice and chill.  Ordered the chef's choice charcuterie board. It was very good! Various different cheeses and meats. You can ask for more ciabbata bread if you ate all your bread and still need more for the meats and cheeses.  They lose one star because their burger was not good. Just very bland, unseasoned, and dry."}
{"text":"Nice lunch menu... A very relaxed atmosphere.  The lunch menu was average sandwiches, but with some higher quality meats.  The deserts are great, we got the blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate cake.  I'd like to go back for the dinner menu, but overall a nice lunch.  *use the parking garage in the center of the building and they will validate parking"}
{"text":"The food was good but the waiter didn't bother understanding my order and gave me the incorrect ones. But after all the food was good ."}
{"text":"Ended up going at 3pm. Just so happen to arrive at the start of Happy Hour (3-6)  Bartender was very friendly. She helped me pick out a few items from the menu. Try asking what they recommend, get way to step outside of your comfort zone and find new foods.  Had the Zucchini Fritters and Salumi Toast, both a great selection. Look fwd to going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Grilled tacos were delish. My sister had the short rib stew which was excellent too. In fact it was the tastiest I ever had. The soft pretzels in our appetizer were nice and soft. The cheese was just ok. It needed more flavor like a cheddar beer cheese. It was too mild for dipping pretzels. Nice feel inside and our server was very ftiendly. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! They coordinated with our big group very last minute and were able to work us in! Their service was great and servers were very professional and kind! They were very attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"Although it had good flavor my  chicken was on the dry side without enough sauce , totally overpriced for what you get , been there done that most likely won't go back ."}
{"text":"Great place this is awesome. Great service excellent food what more can anyone want this place is a must to visit while in Phoenix"}
{"text":"It's just okay  It was fun to be there in the city and near stuff. The server was super attentive and treated me on my birthday. I am all about the cheesy pretzels; They are one of the few places that has lumber yard hef on tap which is a win for me. Otherwise the food is nothing to write home about nor are the mix drinks."}
{"text":"The first time I went to The Arrogant Butcher on a Saturday evening, the wait for three people was 45 minutes. We finally sat down.  We ordered or meals which were: slow roasted prime, chicken stroganoff, and the fish & chips. -The slow roasted prime rib was probably the best piece of meat I've ever tasted. I almost died with the explosion of flavor and tenderness. It was a huge think piece of meat, too. The scalloped potatoes were decent. -I tried the stroganoff and it tasted a little off to me. It also needed salt (flavor.)  -The fish & chips with coleslaw were delicious but EXTREMELY greasy. I personally think they should strain the grease off a little better.   Our bill was $75 for three meals and two glasses of tea.  On another occasion, I went on a Friday night around 7 or 8 and the wait was only 15 minutes for two people. Our server was awesome. Very knowledgeable about the menu. Sadly I forgot his name.   LETS TALK FOOD We ordered the montechevre, the fancy deviled eggs, filet mignon, New York strip, chateau smith Cabernet Sauvignon, and after school special. -The montechevre was bomb and the cherry marmalade complimented it perfectly. I could probably eat a whole tub of that marmalade. LOL -The deviled eggs weren't that special. I'll make those at home. -The filet mignon was SO good I almost died again. The spinach and carrots were great additions to the meat. I would order this plate again. -I didn't try the New York strip but my friend said it was good.  -The cab was awesome. Smooth and bold just the way I like it! -My friend said the after school special was overdosed with lime. They needed to tone it down a bit.  The bill was approximately $150.00  The decorations are nice and the bathrooms are huge and cool. I feel like this place is hit and miss. Some stuff is amazing and then other stuff is not worth the money. It's like roulette! I'm not sure how I feel about this place."}
{"text":"The bad stars all lined up for my wife and me on a weekend getaway while having dinner here. The food was actually quite good. But the service beginning with the hostess left much  to be desired. They should consider robotic servers.   The evening was saved by the manager who was new but had the good sense to spend a few minutes speaking with us to understand the situation and apologize and then take 40% off our bill.   Recommend taking a Valium before dining here."}
{"text":"I've been dying to give this place a try, not only from the massive amount of good reviews, but just looking at the food from the outside patio makes my mouth water.  Good place for a date night, but as it started to get darker, the music got louder, darker, and clubby.. If that's a word. The cheese fondue is yummy but incredibly dosed with kosher salt if you're into that. I got the ribs and hubby got the prime rib.. Both were incredibly delicious and moist, not the best we've ever had, but far above the worst. Drinks are very strong, and strangely they didn't ask for my ID (maybe I am starting to look my age!) Fries are run-in-the-mill, not exceptionally crunchy or flavorful. The value for the money is definitely there though, we left with lots of leftovers.   Waitress was very nice and answered all of our questions, and even suggested a parking garage we could use next time to park by closer, and that they validate parking. A must come back."}
{"text":"Walking around downtown Phoenix encouraged me to try this place. The vibes were poppin with a big crowd. We were fortunate that there was no wait, seated quickly and in a booth, without a reservation. Unfortunately, the menu wasn't anything special.  It was all simple American food. I shared the ribs with French fries. It was decent. I mean it's no Texas BBQ (I haven't really had that yet but I plan to, haha).   The waitress treated us as if we weren't from phoenix (which we aren't)...it wasn't mean, but I felt that it was implied. I really wanted to try a restaurant that wasn't in San Diego. I'm glad I was able to go, but it really is just one of those simple restaurants with a fun name."}
{"text":"I think my mojo in picking places is a little off... but just a little.  I came here with coworkers and they were able to accommodate my reservation with relatively short notice, so that's a plus.  I would say that the drinks are better than the food, but that's just based on what I've had to eat there.  If you like modern cuisine, this place is for you!  First of all, the restaurant at dusk/dinner is very dim, so break out those reading glasses. Their wine list is amazing!  I would recommend the antipasti plate for an appetizer because it's the bomb.com. Be sure to get the awesome garlic and mushrooms with the antipasti plate. The house salad was one of the best I've had in a while, especially with the dressing on the side.  The squash tortelli was a little heavy on the squash.  I thought it could have been better balanced with smaller tortellini pasta and a hit of acid in the sauce.  It was overall a very heavy dish.    I think this is a great spot for a happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my lunchtime visit to the Arrogant Butcher.  I am sometimes underwhelmed by Fox Concept restaurants, so I went in with fairly low expectations which were thankfully exceeded.  The service was helpful and very friendly.  She was great at suggesting items and drinks, and steered me towards the AMAZING lemonade/vodka drink with fresh muddled raspberries.  It was refreshing and delicious - so fresh!  The crushed ice was a really nice touch.  My lunch was the chicken club sandwich with fries.  Wow! Delicious!  Chicken, ham, bacon... really great flavor, and the bread just put the dish over the top.  I also enjoyed sampling my friend's fondue with pretzel bites.    It was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Good spot if you are going to any event downtown. I highly recommend the butchers plate if you like food variety. I have been here a few times and each time I say man that was good. It is a tad pricey but I never feel like they ripped me off when I leave. Our most recent sever Xavier was great. Friendly, prompt while offering good recommendations. Give this place a stop for lunch downtown or a pregame/ event meal."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a featured cocktail which was well made. I ate there late night, and it wasn't too busy. I particularly enjoyed our waiter, as the service was wonderful. I ordered the sweet potato tortellini with organic prosciutto. It was so buttery and delicious."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here yesterday. This was my second visit and they were both the same. Solid service with an excellent menu that is poorly executed. The kitchen staff is not up to par. The cole slaw is warm and the Cubano is cold meat with hot bread. The soups are completely void of all seasoning. This is a well designed corporate restaurant with a weak kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Another jewel in the Fox crown-read amazing look and feel but outrageous prices for food that's really nothing special.  A few of us went to lunch the other day and one of my buddies orders the prime rib french dip.  The server asks if they would like mushrooms, peppers or onions to which my friend replied yes, please.  They were kind enough to charge $2 EACH for said add-ons so $6 total additional charge.  I mean seriously, I can get ten pounds of onions for two dollars... I ended up splitting a chicken club and a ~1 oz. cheese 'plate' with a friend and we both got iced tea.  $24...to top it off the waiter was kind of a dick. I probably would never patronize a Fox restaurant again if I didn't get hooked up with gift cards on occasion."}
{"text":"Want to try some of their delicious meats and cheeses but not sure how to choose?  Get the butcher's platter!  We did, and did not regret it!  It came with meats and cheeses, and also some little nibbles (deviled eggs, bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and some sort of smoked salmon dip).  For my meal I got the sea bass, and it was also amazing.  Fish was cooked perfectly and the whole dish had fantastic flavor.  A great dining option near the Talking Stick arena if you're going to an event there. But be sure to get there on the early side if you're planning to eat... we checked in at 5pm (our event started at 8pm) and had only a 30-45 minute wait.  By the time they called us up to our table the lobby was packed and the wait time was over an hour.  We were glad we got there when we did!"}
{"text":"So I crushed this food! I got the fish and chips. The fish could've been seasoned better but the tartar sauce and vinegar made it great! I've never had vinegar on fish but the waiter told me to try it and it was worth it! I usually don't like coleslaw but this coleslaw was perfectly crispy and not too vinegary. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Surprisingly disappointed.   Last 2 visits the food was outstanding.   Server Andy was great but food took way too long to come from the kitchen for an early Saturday night.   Only hot item was the stew other entrees were like warm.  Hopefully this was just an off night."}
{"text":"I'm not giving up on this restaurant, and neither should you, but a follow-up experience wasn't so perfect as the first. I ordered the same sandwich (Turkey Pastrami) because I was dreaming of it, and unfortunately, it came on a regular bun, not the pretzel bun (that makes it) and the cook forgot to put the cole slaw on the sandwich, too.  My husband had the fish sandwich and it was good but lacked the cheese that was supposed to be on it... The server was very good about correcting the issues and apologizing, but I was disappointed, nonetheless.  Still, a huge lunch crowd dictates good food, and I'm definitely going back..and hoping for a repeat performance of perfect when I do..."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to let all the haters know I am NOT an Arrogant Butcher employee or an employee of Fox Concepts.  That being said,  I went to AB last week and was pleasantly surprised.  I love downtown Phoenix and keep hoping it'll start getting more popular down there.  The ambience is great and love the decor.   Boyfriend had fish & chips which I know is hard to mess up but it was honestly the BEST fish & chips I've ever had (better than any I had in England).  I had the swordfish w/ barley.  The swordfish was cooked perfectly and I loved the tiny kick in the seasoning.  The entrees were wonderful, but the best part of the whole meal was the blueberry cheesecake!  It comes in a jar and is not ordinary cheesecake but AB's version is soooooo good.  I wanted another! Service was amazing and food came out in a timely manner.  I don't like when restaurants make their uniforms \"unisex\" because the poor girls always end up looking so manly.  Let the girls wear something a little more flattering!! I have been to several Fox places and I couldn't help but notice a lot of copy-catting from other menus.  My only wish for AB would be that they created more of their own entrees/appetizers."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher is a great place to visit as long as there is nothing else going on in the area.   The night before my visit was an 1 1/2 hour wait.   Tonight I got in with no problem and the service was excellent.    For an appetizer I had the Pretzel Fondue which was excellent.  My only complaint was that I had only eaten two bites and my entree was at the table.  It worked out well though because the bites needed to cool down so they became dessert.     I had the meatloaf special which sounds weird at a place like this, but it was excellent.   The meat loaf tasted great and the green beans were steamed just right with a little bit of seasoning.    I recommend that if you do go here that you save room for dessert.  I missed out on a few things that sounded great."}
{"text":"I dined at TAB for te second time before Neil Diamon this last week and was blown away. The restaurant was packed, busting at the seams with energy. The staff was friendly and smiling as they hurried about. I was sat quickly and greeted promptly by my server Ryan, even with so many people in the place. We had oysters (awesome!) the kale salad, crab stuffed chicken and a filet with shrimp added on the side. The food was incredible, and I still can't believe how effiecintly it all came out, one course after another without missing a beat. Even my old fashion was top notch! We ate a full meal and had an experience that rocked our expectations all within an hour. Neil diamond had some tough competition to live up to after dinner! This place is so friggin awesome I can't recommend it high enough, all I wish is that I worked here!"}
{"text":"I spent four nights in downtown Phoenix at a conference this past week, and I only got out of the depressing conference hotel a few times, for off-campus dinners. On Friday night, I walked over to The Arrogant Butcher with four friends, and we had a nice meal.  This place was actually our second choice, but apparently you can't just walk into Blue Hound on a Friday night and expect to plonk down at a large table. We had passed The Arrogant Butcher on our walk over, and it looked spacious and charming, so we went back. (It later became apparent that everyone from this conference ate at this restaurant at some point or another.) There was a short wait--twenty minutes, if that--which we spent at the wide-open bar. We could've eaten there too if we were a smaller group, but were happy to get a comfortable table at a corner of the restaurant.  I really enjoyed the place. I feel like I've been to a lot of restaurants that might as well be called The Arrogant Butcher and liked them all. This one was in line with the rest--meat-centric menu, lightly throwback Ron-Swanson-for-Pottery-Barn decor--and very obviously established in the last five or so years. Somewhere, there's a restaurateur Pinterest board that creates this exact restaurant. Service was solid, both at bar and table. We ordered food in a couple waves and did an interesting check split, and our server handled everything well.  I had a cocktail to start and a beer with my dinner, and both were great. The Snakeskin Boots was a lovely drink made with Maestro Dobel tequila, Ancho Reyes, Cointreau, citrus, and smashed lime, garnished with a shishito (or other mild/green/little) pepper. It was very well balanced with a pleasant kick. The Four Peaks Kilt Lifter was a nice Scottish ale that took me through dinner and, it should be noted, the entire conference--this beer is everywhere in Phoenix, and I adore it.  The food was solid, the menu stacked with gastropub/trendy new American fare. We split a few hearty appetizers, and these were pretty good. The house soft pretzels were nice, fresh and fluffy bites--like donut holes but for pretzels-- served with a rich provolone fondue. The artichoke hummus was also great, smooth and flavorful, the hummus cut with artichoke, olive, and tomato and served with flatbread. Then there was the Butcher's Platter, an assortment of the chef's favorite charcuterie-type items of the day. This came with deviled eggs, smoked salmon rillettes, bacon-wrapped sweet potato, a few cured meats, a spot of cheese, olives, pistachios, a few condiments, and a bread plate. The deviled eggs were a definite highlight, topped with crispy prosciutto bits, and I also liked the sweet potato and stuffed peppers. The meat and cheese weren't anything special on their own, but the house mustard was great. The bread plate was kind of strange--the crusty bread was drizzled with a startlingly salty balsamic drizzle, and the only other option was greasy madeleines, not exactly pile-with-charcuterie bread.  After the appetizers, everyone got their own salads. I'm not really a salad person, but I was the last one at the table to order, and everyone else had gotten a salad, so you tell me--WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I didn't want to get the only $30 entree at the table, so I went with the crowd and ate healthy. It wasn't a bad choice. I ordered the roasted beet salad with a filet of grilled salmon on top, which gave it some substance. The salmon was excellent, moist and flaky with a good grilled char. The salad was good too, the roasted beets mixed with grilled corn, green bean, asparagus, caramelized fennel, pistachio, manchego, and crispy prosciutto. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and they came together well, particularly with a full meal's worth of salmon on top.  I had a great time at The Arrogant Butcher. This dinner was one of the only exciting food outings in a five-day trip, and I appreciated my brief escape from the Hyatt Regency. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in this part of Phoenix. Even if you get a salad, you can't go too wrong."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.  Dined with a large group so we had a set menu. I requested no butter with my crab stuffed chicken breast but they served it on the side just in case I felt the chicken was too dry.  It was de-lish!"}
{"text":"Awesome job Yelp! While visiting Phoenix for a convention I found this place only a few blocks away from our hotel. We stopped in for dinner and although we were part of a small rush crowd we were quickly seated.   The waiter was humorous and prompt, and made some great recommendations for our meals. I ended up with the sweet potato pasta which is somewhat unusual for me. It was incredible! The broth was pretty sweet, but the waiter recommended the spicy ham which was a perfect balance. The wine was lovely and reasonable priced and they have a really cool way to create your appetizer charcuterie plate.   If you're a meat or cheese fan this is a definitely visit in the area. It also works well for vegetarians as the sweet potato dish rocked!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great customer service.  Dining area is always clean and has a lot of space.  The chairs needs some work done or maybe a replacement but overall is a great restaurant on the area."}
{"text":"This is not the best of Michael Fox's restaurants.  The food is just \"ok\".  The location is pretty central for any type of downtown event.  However, I have tried this place a few times and have never been blown away by the quality of the food.  The service, however, is good."}
{"text":"Came in for a day of bar and food hopping around phoenix. It was during comicon so there was a 40 minute wait for tables but we found a few chairs at the bar, which is open seating, right away.   We got the short rib stew with cornbread and a couple beers. The stew was very decadent with the perfect amount of spice to it from the chiles. The egg added that extra oomph to it and the cornbread with it was the perfect bite.   Happy hour is only Monday - Friday."}
{"text":"Good food in an upscale bar atmosphere. Smart design due to close proximity to Hotels and the ballpark (to capture both clientele). Seems like it was pulled right out of that Bar Rescue show. Everything is done top notch."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Crab legs are to die for but the service sucks!!! It seems like all the employees here are deaf!   this place would have 5 stars if the employees could check on us once in a while. Took forever to waive someone down!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday and was VERY excited to see they had happy hour. We had the shrimp appetizer, which was fantastic and The Fix (amazing drink and very inexpensive). The bartender was super nice and friendly, we will defiantly be back (for happy hour)."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch and was pleased to find out this place was had a connection with Culinary Dropout.  Service was great and the food hit the spot.  Try the pretzel fondue.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Been here several times, most often before a Dbacks game. Again today stopped in before a game with a large party.  The service and food were excellent and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. Great place to pre  game."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in the downtown area. Easily walkable from hotels and the convention center. We waited about 10 minutes for a table on a busy night. It was a little loud, but once seated it was ok - easy enough to carry on a convo with each other. The menu was tiny - not tiny in terms of offerings, but literally tiny. One of the smallest menus I've seen. There were several offerings that sparked my interest. And I wish I was hungrier so I could've tried more. In the end, I just had the grilled salmon. It was great - wonderful veggies and perfectly cooked. Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. She checked on us often and had good menu suggestions. There are several beer, wine, and cocktail offerings as well. Portions were pretty sizable. Good quality and quantity for the price. Nice ambiance and decor. Good overall vibe. In short, I'd readily dine here again."}
{"text":"I cannot explain how impressed I was with the service and food here. The restaurant was recommend by so many friends and so I had to check it out. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Probably the best customer service I have had in awhile. The manager accommodated to us when we wanted to watch a specific football game and opened up an area for us. The food was delicious. I had the pretzels as an appetizer and they were finger licking good. The jambalaya was amazing. Very flavorful. I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could enjoy this place often. It's a must visit."}
{"text":"I live about 45 minutes from AB so I'm not exactly \"in the neighborhood.\"  Yet, we end up there more times than I can count.  And why is that?    The service is fantastic.  The drinks (especially the drinks of the week) are extremely tasty and it's just an all around good time.  We went there last night after a less than amazing experience across the street at the Bitter & Twisted Cocktail lounge.  Our awesome server (I can't remember her name but she looks like Carrie from Mythbusters) smoothed over our rough experience and was present without being too present.  It's kind of like going to your best friend's house - comfy and fun."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix, seemed like a great spot. The room they put us in (the one with all the pictures) was ridiculously loud. Lots of big parties, hit hard to enjoy a meal.  Service was fine, appetizers and desserts were REALLY good, entrees were mediocre at best.   My wife's prime rib and my ribs were both way over cooked and dry. No seasoning or rub on the ribs (don't rely on just sauce).  Hoped for better....it was a C"}
{"text":"This place is classy, quick and reasonable. Great for lunch and groups! There's a parking lot across the street - pay lot. The food and service was perfect. I would recommend this to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Great food,  we had the hamburger and the beef short ribs, both were excellent.  The short ribs were in a green chili sauce with a sunnyside egg on top.  The poblano peppers added just the right amount of heat and flavor.  They have a decent beer selection as well."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher is a very nice restaurant but they do not advertise anywhere that their menu becomes limited to the most expensive dishes when there is a sports game playing. With this lack of certainty I think this will be my last time at the Arrogant Butcher.  This idea that the menu is centered around the most popular dishes to provide customers the best experience during events is ridiculous. The Arrogant Butcher kept only the most expensive dishes leaving you no choice but to spend twice than you normally would. The children couldn't order anything because a simple and definitely easy dish like a hamburger was refused to be made. So unlike a Fox restaurant. When the Arrogant Butcher is ready to serve for all ages I'll come back."}
{"text":"Food tasted good; however, overall, it was overpriced and the service was poor."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Great service and the food was amazing. Really enjoyed this place. Reminded me of True Foods, very fresh and yummy Beet salad highly recommend."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy the food and vibes here. Such a cool place to go with a big group of people. I recommend getting the pretzel dipped in fondue as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. Cool atmosphere. Great location. A tad pricy and not too many menu options but the quality was good and the flavors were delightful."}
{"text":"Had the awesome crab stuffed chicken on a bed of spinach that was tender and juicy. Husband had the short rib stew with fried egg and green Chile with a cornbread muffin. Their Mediterranean salad was superb! A bit pricey but very worth the \"upscale comfort foods\"."}
{"text":"This a really great lunch spot. It isn't that loud and the food is really good. Most plates run you about $15. I've been twice now for lunch both times and found the service to be high quality. The food was good for the money. The  pretzel bites are the best I've had in Phoenix and the cheese they use is really good. Would recommend for smaller groups like 4-6 people.   Not sure how good they are at accommodating larger groups but seems like their sitting area is arranged for smaller groups."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, enthusiastic servers who love their restaurant. Nice decor, reasonable prices. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The most unwelcoming staff that I ever had seen! If you are a single person they hesitate to give you a table ... I asked for a table three times and each time they pointed me to the bar... the waiter was so arrogant too (definitely goes well with the name of restaurant)."}
{"text":"My experience here was overall very good. My wife loved her cheese ravioli, and my pastrami sandwich was solid. There was a minor delay with getting us seated, but nothing major. It's a little pricey as well, but that's to be expected for the area. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Staff is rushed. They're in a hurry to get you out the door. Noisy. Food good but not up to their hype. It's not bad. I'd give it a solid \"ok.\""}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference, and we came here for lunch. The food was really good, but HUGE portions! Especially for lunch. We got the shrimp and peppers appetizer and the hummus. I got the jambalaya and it was very good! I'm so glad I got it. The strawberry lemonade was a little too tart for my taste, but nothing some sugar can't fix :D"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to The Arrogant Butcher ever since it opened, and, well, it took me more time than I'd like to admit before I finally made it there.  But, sometimes waiting makes the outcome that much better, and, boy, was the outcome fantastic.    Thankful I was with someone who is a regular, and who knew how to navigate us through the delicious menu. (Although, I didn't need much guidance as I had been eying their beef short rib stew since I first peeked at their online menu).  We started first with appetizers, and had a great sample of what they offered: the rock shrimp and the pretzel & fondue were amazing.  I couldn't stop eating the pretzel & fondue -- I was afraid I wouldn't have enough room in my tummy for my meal... but of course I would.  And I almost did. The beef stew was so delicious, and even though I was kind of weirded out by the friend egg on top (I know foodies die for that stuff), I gobbled up almost every morsel until my tummy just couldn't hold any more.  And throughout it all, I was sucking on one of their specialty cocktails recommended to me by a coworker -- The Polish Fix.  It was quite good, but very strong, and I was feeling it even with all the food I was eating.  All in all, a great treat for my senses. It is in a great location -- right on the corner of 2nd St. & Jefferson, and if you chose to eat outside in the cooler months, or inside facing the wall of windows, you'll be guaranteed a great people watching opportunity.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other menu items.  I'm glad I waited, but now I can't get enough of that arrogant butcher!"}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised to find that this place is now open on Sundays! Although, I didn't eat the Polish Fix cocktail is the perfect drink, providing a little bit of tartness and is refreshing. If you don't want to pay $10 for the vodka-based beverage, ask if they can substitute the premium vodka for well."}
{"text":"Food is meh, especially compared to stars like Culinary Dropout (this may be the weak link the Fox chain). Plentiful outdoor seating is nice, but this meal left something to be desired."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of fox concept restaurants, I really wanted to like this place! Unfortunately, it let me down.  To start, we had reservations for 6:45 and the host couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and said that someone else took it??? For that reason, it took them over 20 minutes to seats us.... with a reservation.....  Once we got to our table, our waiter was super rushed and frazzled and listed at least 5 items that they were out of. Weird!   I ended up getting the New York strip and it wasn't special at all, especially for the price.  Not planning on returning. This place is too busy and can't keep up with itself."}
{"text":"Like a shiny new car, you still need to look under the hood before you choose to buy.  I love all the exterior bells and whistles of The Arrogant Butcher including the hostess that greets you, the pleasant and hip music and the well thought out interior design.  Our waiter even kept the good vibe going with decent service.  However, our lunch choice of steak Cobb salad tells a different story.  The $14 dollar salads were lacking on more then one account.  First, the waiter confirmed our good choice and added \"I hope you like blue cheese...\"  Well the salad came with no 'blue cheese' so hence the awkward (and unnecessary) conversation pursued \"I don't see any blue cheese, is it supposed to be on there?\"  Second, the portion size was small, particularly the measly steak portions.  Consider yourself lucky to get a couple bites of the needed protein to survive.    It's weird but I was actually considering asking for the menu again so I could order another meal.  And that shouldn't be your thought process as you drop $50 for 2 salads and 2 beers...  So in conclusion, before you buy the car, be sure you look under the hood and past all the bells and whistles..."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch since I heard such great things about this place. Sat at the bar so I wouldn't have to wait for a table. Nice atmosphere and around 11:30am the business suits started rolling in from the surrounding buildings. Great service at the bar. He suggested the chicken quinoa salad, which had more lettuce and less chicken and quinoa.  Nice healthy portion and was just enough for lunch. Will be back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about the Fox concept restaurants.  My husband and I were given a gift card and we chose this restaurant to try based on our tastes and the reviews.    The atmosphere was great,  not too loud.  The service was excellent and the pretzel bites were great.    My husband ordered the mussel appetizer as a main and I got the scallop dish.  My scallops had serious grit issues,  I'm surprised my teeth didn't chip. The flavor and sear was great,  but the grit lost the dish.  The mussels had a muted flavor and the stock seemed dull and muddy.   We had a gift card so we are thankful we didn't pay for our meal out of our own pocket,  as well,  management was very understanding and surprised us by taking the scallops off the bill.  We will try this place again, just because we know they are known for their meat and cheeses.  Maybe seafood just isn't their thing :)"}
{"text":"Visited during lunch with a couple friends and we loved the food here! The atmosphere was upbeat. Even though it was really busy, our waiter was attentive and on top of everything."}
{"text":"We ate here 4 years ago - and have shared it as a \"must go to\" with anyone that we knew was heading to Phoenix.  We're totally jacked to revisit tonight and brought along a valued client.  All of us very much enjoyed the zucchini appetizers, our meals (king crab legs, salmon, & sea bass), and dessert (salted pretzel and chocolate fudge ice creams).  Ian was our waiter - request him - he's excellent."}
{"text":"I think the other reviewers were eating at another restaurant of the same name. This place is awful. I wanted a salad and iced tea for lunch. The tea that came was passion fruit not black tea and the waiter did not inform me of that. The salad was OK but the dressing was very spicy. Again no info on menu or from waiter. The noise level even at lunch was deafening. Recorded music like Coldplay very loud. I asked to be moved away from  speakers or to turn it down. No response. The wait staff was inattentive. Save your money. The arrogant butcher deserves it's unfortunate choice of names."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went on New Years Eve of 2015. We made reservations and arrived early. They were able to seat us early and quickly.  Absolutely love the butchers platter! It is a \"must-order\"! I have gotten the Fish and Chips before (which was great. Cole slaw is on point) but this time I wanted to try the Scallops. They were delicious. Cooked just right. We also got the chocolate cake desert; amazing!  Definitely a fun, hipster ambiance with great beer choices and food selections!"}
{"text":"Had amazing service. The pretzel appetizer is a big must! Two of the meals we had were great- the other two at the table were.... Really small and not what the server described- so be clear on what you're ordering :)"}
{"text":"The food here was magnificent. We split the antipasto platter, had a few drinks (the mule was amazing!), and enjoyed the pork carnitas and the short rib stew. Both main dishes were beyond expectation. The appetizer was a great selection of a variety of meats and cheeses. The main standout point, however, was the service. Our waiter was beyond amazing, constantly keeping our drinks filled, checking in on us, and offering great recommendations. A must-visit when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This super busy restaurant is serving up delightful fresh food to the hungry masses. Super friendly and efficient service tops the modern industrial decor - big light shades, leather booths, wood and tile are some of the design features. Very tasteful colors and lighting.   We tried the cheddar cheese and some olives to start and paired nicely with a well made dirty martini. The berry compote was so good and complemented the sharp cheddar very well.  Their menu features steaks, seafood and salads. There were several exciting dishes I'd like to try but was hungry for something light so we built our own Caesar Salad with a delicious medium grilled salmon. It was the most amazing blend of lemon, grilled pepper and asparagus, and bright notes of some kind of parsley or something. It was really good.   To end the meal, we tried one of the blueberry cheesecake mason jars with a strudel crumble on the top. The blueberry topping was the same compote used in the cheese plate - not a bad thing! It was really delicious. The espresso I ordered with a lemon twist came in a nice tall clear highball sort of glass which was kind of different.   Great experience!"}
{"text":"So I have been here 3 times and I really wanted it to wow me each and every time but it simply doesn't.  First time I was with a friend and we were drinking more than eating so when my ridiculously expensive bill showed up I almost threw up all the $12.66 martinis I had drank.  Seriously?!?  The only place in town where I wouldn't freak on that price is AZ88 because one martini and you are almost done in.  Our server was friendly but I had to tell her to stop rushing us, she came back every 10 minutes or so wondering if we wanted our check.  I told her I would flag her down when needed but that we planned on being there a while. Second time I went for lunch and everything was ok but not amazing. Third time was last night and it will most likely be my last.  Every month 3 of my lady friends and myself try a new place, I actually was the one to suggest here. We started at the bar to have a cocktail while waiting for our whole party to arrive.  When it was time to move to a table our bartender asked us to close out our tab.  Didn't even offer to transfer it which is standard.  We ordered a started of cheese, roasted garlic, prosciutto, cornicons and oysters.  The little nugget of cheese we received was just that, a tiny little nugget.  Now I am a huge cheese snob, I have my very own travel bag from Venissimo Cheese shop in San Diego and every time I visit I come home with roughly $100 worth of cheese.  I know my cheese, I know the cost, I felt cheated that we each only got a nibble.  The oysters were good, not gritty at all, but there were a few staple accouterments that were missing, tabasco and crackers.  I ordered the beet salad which was middle of the road, but I did like that the beets didn't have a loamy taste.  One of my dining companions ordered the steak which was overcooked so she sent it back.  It came back better but with the same sides on the plate, they literally transferred what was on her original plate to the new one.  Terrible!  You don't let a plate sit under the heat lamp while you redo something, you make a whole new plate.  The worst part of the evening was after our appetizer our server informed us that it was almost 9 and the kitchen closes at 9.  WTF!?!  We are already seated, you know we are going to order dinner, there were at least 5 tables full in our section alone and you feel the need to rush our order?!?  Lame is a word that doesn't even do it justice.  To add the cherry on that lame sauce sundae, they kicked us out into the cold to wait for our ride!  It was freezing and all I had was a thin jacket WITHOUT gloves, I was shivering pretty bad by the time my fiance rolled up.  He was pissed that there were 4 women standing outside of the restaurant we just spent a pretty penny at and if there was a place to park he would have gone in himself to complain to the manager. (Thanks for looking out babe!) I will finish this off with the positives, they had cocktail onions.  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find cocktail onion served in this town.  Second their system for splitting checks is hands down amazing with us each getting charged 1/4 of the appetizer price.  I haven't seen that before.  Third the decor is nice."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch and drinks after work. We recommend the oysters for sure and the shrimp and French dip.  Very fun atmospheres.  Especially if you get there early to avoid the wait and sit outside when the weather is great."}
{"text":"Yummmmm!  In town for a conference, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I arrived shortly after opening.  There were very few people there, but by the time I left, it was packed!  I had my laptop doing some work, but never felt rushed.    I was torn between the Cubano and the turkey pastrami...decided to go with the Cubano.  I do not regret it!  Pros: GREAT service!  The server was helpful, friendly, and attentive. OMG.  The Cubano was NOTHING like the wimpy, thin Cubano's I've had in the past.  It was thick, toasty, and savory.  It was so hearty that I could only eat half!  Cons: Umm...can't think of any..."}
{"text":"Great food and really fun setting. We had an amazing time with a group of good friends celebrating the holidays. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good clean environment and the food was good! We ordered multiple appetizers and all of them were tasteful. However, my entree (salmon) was nothing special. I also got to try three desserts and thought all of them were decent.   The thing I liked the most about this place was their service. We had top of the line service... my wine glass was never empty at any one point throughout the night. The people were nice and very attentive. They were quick to respond and I thought the customer service this night led me to leave them a star rating higher than I normally would for mediocre food."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and it was pretty packed so I thought it should be a good place to eat and relax, plus it was happy hour! My husband ordered a kilt lifter and I ordered a mr.pineapple which was not too sweet( I hate beers that are too sweet) we ordered off of their happy hour menu which didn't offer too much to choose from. We order the garlic and mushroom toast and also a salmon toast ( I forgot the whole name of that one) both were very good and only 4 bucks. We also ordered the pretzel bites with cheese fondue and omg it was so good and they give you a good portion. I wasn't impressed with their regular menu. Not much to choose from and the prices were high. Perhaps that is why it is called the arrogant butcher. We probably will not be coming back but it is always good to try new things and different spots."}
{"text":"Despite the modern decor, friendly staff, and tasty pretzel fondue appetizer, I'm sorry to say that I wasn't impressed. The burger entrée left a lot to be desired. I normally take my burger cooked to a medium, but when the waitress didn't ask, I didn't speak up. Perhaps I should have. The meat was thin, dry and overdone, and the toppings did little to help that - hardly worthy of restaurant prices. Others in my party had a similar experience with the salmon. Overall, a middling experience. With the enormous number of sports bars in downtown, I recommend trying something else in the area instead."}
{"text":"I attended the soft-opening and the atmosphere is an A.  It had a sort of old fashioned modern chop house feel and a very unique menu; however, the food was extremely rich and very salty.  I notice most of the Fox Restaurant foods always leave me thirsty for days.  The house soft pretzels and provolone fondue was really good.  The grilled swordfish with arthichokes was also extremely good but way too salty as was the ribeye my boyfriend ordered.    Service was great, especially for a soft opening.    I will definitely give brunch a try in the near future but probably will only visit for the atmosphere, appetizers and cocktails in the future."}
{"text":"Once again, a Phx bar/restaurant has a lame selection of draft beers. I guess the locals just don't care about craft beers?   More likely we haven't found the right spots. But for those seeking a nice draft beer, don't come here. But Coors and Modelo are not the only lager beers, Phx beer buyers!  Food was ok. Happy hour ok. We had dinner before. D'Backs game. Ribs were ok. Jambalaya way too spicy. Kale salad very good as was Cesar salad.  Could be much better. But isn't awful."}
{"text":"It's coo. Kinda expensive. . Nice ambiance. ... does smell like sea food though.... (I don't like seafood lol). . Fish.. super nice staff this far"}
{"text":"A nice fun place for a gathering, I had the salmon and the pudding as dessert. I loved it. And it was conveniently right next to out hotel. Perfect for a fun night."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Overall, I seem to not like the Fox restaurants, but this one is OK. We did a beer dinner here once, too, and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday for a few drinks before going to Stand Up live.  I like that they have HH on Saturday.  That's a big thumbs up for me.  The pretzel balls and cheese are to die for.  Love drinking The Mule too.  I do think they could have a few more items on happy hour and their menu seems a bit over priced.  The atmosphere is good.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant right down town by the ballpark, arena and orchestra. Reasonable prices with good food and drink. Lively atmosphere and great service. We go often and recommend it."}
{"text":"We visited this past weekend. It took on hour to receive our meal and two of the dishes were cold. The waiter was bad but gave us free dessert to make up for the food and service. The peanut butter cup gelato was inedible. Tiny scoop of gelato with peanut butter slop on top. Not sure if the restaurant just had a staffing issue or what but we'd never go back."}
{"text":"I dined here with my friend and we had the best experience we could have imagined. We sat at the bar and Andrew was our bartender. He engaged the entire bar and had everybody so entertained. He was so knowledgable and personable. A true gem! We will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this amazing Fox restaurants concept. The food was outstanding. There's really nothing else to say about it.  The bartender was incredible, and the overall experience left me giddy. In short... eat here. And have the house-made mustard. You must."}
{"text":"Was at a conference recently (TPE/NASPA) and kept hearing fellow conference goers rave about this place. I heard it gets really packed and difficult to get in during the dinner time, so a friend and I ventured one early afternoon shortly after they had opened. We had no issue being seated quickly on the patio which was perfect for the lovely weather. Several of the dishes sounded tasty and the waiter was helpful in providing personal favorites depending on our mood. We split the pretzel tots with provolone fondue, amazing. Little pillows of heaven. Then I ordered the squash & pomegranate salad with added chicken, very creative and yummy. Also a large bowl, plenty filling. My friend had the pastrami on a pretzel bun which he said was also tasty, although he expected more flavor from the pretzel bun. I had heard the peanut butter dessert was amazing, and had full intention of ordering it, however alas I was too full. I wish I had tried this place earlier in my trip, I would have liked to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Ok, but not great. We stopped here for lunch, and it was rather expensive, and the food was ok. The service was a bit slow as well. Definitely will not be back because there are so many other places around that serve lunch as well, and are much less expensive."}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue is terrific! Also recommend the turkey bbq sandwich.  I've been to this restaurant a few times and the only concern I have is that it gets too busy.  While it's great to see a business thrive, I find the staff sometimes doesn't know how to handle the amount of business it has.  More help might do the trick."}
{"text":"We stopped into the Arrogant Butcher for happy hour before a Diamondbacks game. It wasn't too crowded but our service was really slow. We sat around for a long time before anyone came to take our order and then our food got to the table faster than our beer got to the table. We were given the lunch menu and I have to say that there wasn't much on it that sounded appealing. The one thing that did sound really good were the pretzel bits with provolone fondue, and it was quite delicious. The $5 happy hour serving is definitely big enough for two people (about 10 pretzel rolls and at least an entire cup of melty yummy cheese). I don't think I'd want to eat a meal at the restaurant, just based on the menu, but I would happily get the pretzel & fondue again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, over rated, rude and a little dirty. Went before a Suns game sat at bar because even though the place was only 20% full the girl at the front said it would be 20 min. Had the stew....cold and tasteless. Took forever and although we had 1 1/2 hour before game time m, we missed tipoff. Maybe this place is better when there is not a game going on but a fun place to go before an event where you want to have fun later. Not very festive and there are many other choices. Not $150 well spent:("}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my boyfriends second. We went on a Thursday night and had a reservation for 6:30  We were seated immediately in the bar area. Shortly after I came back from the restroom I found out we had to move tables because of a large party that walked in. To me, moving tables isn't a big deal especially since we just sat but they were extremely apologetic and the manager offered to buy us two appetizers and two drinks.   We ordered the mussels and the fried shrimp. And for drinks the daisy and the sexy gin and tonic. The mussels came out on a huge platter and looked overwhelming but it was the perfect portion. The shrimp was my favorite. It had a hint of sweetness to it, like they added honey or cinnamon to the recipe and the flavors complimented each other well. The daisy was delicious and my gin and tonic was refreshing.   For our entree my boyfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the sea bass. Portion wise, his was amazing. My bass came out and it was good but it didn't blow me away which is why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars. I excepted to be wowed since the dish was one of the pricer items. And the side dish it came with had me questioning what exactly I was eating.   Our server was very nice through out the meal and everything ran smoothly. Our bill would have been $120 but they ended up taking off $50 for the inconvenience.   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. We ordered the shrimp and pretzel appetizers and they were great. However the service was awful. We sat at the bar with one other customer and the bartender acted as if we were invisible. Now granted we came in an hour before closing time but late night guests should receive same attention as day guests"}
{"text":"Nice casual but upscale spot in downtown Phoenix. A bit pricier, but the food is worth it. Especially enjoy the fresh seafood. It can get quite crowded in the evening, so I suggest a reservation."}
{"text":"Trendy place and decor with a good view of US Airways Center. Might be a great stop to grab a drink with some friends before a show.    Sweet Potato Tortellini was good, but the sauce was a bit watery.  My friend ordered the AB certified Angus Beef Cheeseburger, to which he was dissatisfied. They offer no choice but medium well, and meat is better with a little pink in his opinion. The cheese almost seemed non-existent, as were the toppings. Overall, the cheeseburger was bland, but they offered to replace it with another menu item, which was nice of them.  The switch out plate was a Turkey Sloppy Joe. He said he has had better Sloppy Joes but at least it has flavor. (You just can't please some people!) he just added that the fries were good."}
{"text":"Usually I avoid places where it costs to park (only in AZ). However I decided to check this place out during lunch. I sat at the bar, ordered a drink, and asked for recommendations. The bartender was extremely helpful and courteous, his recommendation on food choice was spot on. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have always looked at this joint and thought, \" meh one day \" well today was that day... They had my favorite brew on tap, and as I walked in seen oysters sitting on ice, on display. I thought \" I'm gonna like this place\". The wait staff is the definition of customer service (Amanda was my server). Then the food came, papadeux's was my favorite place in town. Tonight that changed. Arrogant butcher! You win. Job well done. Will be back shortly"}
{"text":"Road warrior review:  ate by myself at bar.  Fantastic service. Local beers very good.  Mussels could have used more broth, loved the creativity w the corn and fennel sausage in the dish, it's hard to nail mussels in the desert.  Oysters good, no horseradish though, I consider that an oyster staple.  Nailed the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll, food was fresh, vibe good, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious!   The Zucchini Fritter appetizers definitely hit the spot! You can really taste the zucchini and it's not too heavy even when it's fried.  The Chicken Jambalaya had a nice kick and was delicious.  The Friday's special, King Crab Cioppino was fantastic! Great amount of seafood. Well seasoned!  I would order everything I ordered again! I hope to return on another trip to Phoenix to try out more stuff on their menu!"}
{"text":"Aside from the often reviewed pretzel balls with fondue, which are outstanding, nothing really over delivered. Everything was good...just not OMG good. Service was fair. Getting a table on the patio is a must during this time of year. Will definitely return to sample the steaks. Had a nice local beer selection."}
{"text":"We sat on the shaded patio(with our dog!) and ordered the butcher's plate which is a chef's choice of assorted meats, cheeses and other apps. This was a great meal for me, everything was delicious and it was out very quickly. However, if your splitting this with your man you may want to order an entree to really fill 'me up. He got the Cubano and enjoyed it but it wasn't \"the best he's ever had\". The service was very nice but what would have made it even better is if they offered my panting dog a water dish! Anyways, would recommend!"}
{"text":"God, I love this place.  In fact, I'm obsessed and I haven't been anywhere else for dinner in months.  The charcuterie is outstanding and very well priced.  The pretzel fondue app and the rock shrimp make me cry.  They recently added a filet and, although I'm not a filet fan at all, that's all I ever get.  The wines are really well priced and the cocktails are fun and festive and awesome.  But the servers may be the best part of AB.   Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is with this place. My waiter was barely around and the food was just okay. I personally don't see what all the fuss is about. I think the fact that my waiter saw we weren't buying beer and afterwards he basically was like a ghost and I had to call other staff to get our check and refills on our drinks. I wouldn't go back unless it was a group outing."}
{"text":"All I can say is that the Jambalaya won me over.  Unfortunately we went on a night when there was a game at the stadium across the street so the crowd wasn't the best.  I would of enjoyed it more if the crowd was the typical Sam Fox restaurant crowd but it wasn't. We sat at the bar and the service was below par.  After eating the Jambalaya I completely forgot about the horrible crowd and the shitty service.  So I will go back and I will recommend it."}
{"text":"A great place to gather friends downtown.  Very busty on a weeknight and that's always a good sign.  I followed our servers recommendation and had the stew.  An excellent choice!  Good service and generous selection of  beers."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Arrogant Butcher for a while.  I heard good things but the reviews are mixed.  The service was excellent but the food was about average.  I would go back, because it is close to Chase Field, but with lower food expectations."}
{"text":"Service was poor from the moment we entered,to say the least. I was so excited to try this place but nothing I had was memorable. I would not come back!"}
{"text":"We had just arrived in Phoenix and wondered down to the Chase Field area to see what was going on, and decided to catch a bite to eat.  As we wondered looking for something a bit more upscale we ran across the Arrogant Butcher.  The staff were very attentive and offered a number of great suggestions.  Not knowing what some of the items were our waiter made some suggestions, and then said that if we didn't see something that caught our eye to let him know and he would have the kitchen pull it together for us.  Are you kidding me?  We started with a nice cold craft beer that I was unfamiliar with, and the reason I selected it was based on a suggestion from the waiter, plus a pre-sample.  Nice touch.  We were looking for something light so we decided to go with one of their signature salads since I wasn't up to a full meal.  Our waiter asked what I was in the mood for and I said salmon.  No problem, a nice piece of blackened salmon was added to the salad.  Now that is what I call service.  The salad was excellent and the blackened salmon was cooked just right.  The other menu items looked quite good and I'm sure we'll be back for something more formal at a later date."}
{"text":"A great place to come for a romantic dinner. Absolutely love the pretzel bites with provolone dip. You can sit in a booth and watch a basketball game in a fun & hip environment. There is also bar seating, where a lot of people seem to come after work. The decor, like at all Sam Fox concepts, is impeccably done. The service this time around was great -our waiter was so attentive, funny and thoughtful, as was the rest of the staff. It makes for a stress-free and totally fun night out."}
{"text":"Wow!  Food was spectacular!  Service was awesome and fast. Reasonably priced for the quality of food. Had the prime rib, wife had the filet and the salted caramel dessert. Conrad was great server. Only suggestion would be for the female tattooed servers to cover up some of the art. I don't perceive their customer base to be appreciative. I'm not, but maybe I'm old ?!"}
{"text":"This place is good but there is nothing special about it.  I come here often for work lunches and the service is quick and prices are reasonable. I wish there were more vegetarian / vegan options."}
{"text":"Best food in the whole world. This is my all time favorite restaurant.   Deviled eggs = BEST deviled eggs there are!  Jambalaya = FAVORITE food. They have the best I've ever had hands down!"}
{"text":"Pretzel bread is buttery and fluffy. But that's probably it. Everything else is mediocre.  Slow service. Plain food. Lunch menu is small and uninteresting. But VERY busy for some reason around noon.  So make reservation and you can get yourself a spot among the Very Important-looking People.   But I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"I should be better with names but I am not  so I am going with my receipt and Elecka was AWESOME!! She was knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. She didnt rush us and let us know what she liked over other things. We sat outside but the interior was really nice.The food was great. The restroom was clean."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but service was just ok. We came here on a Sat night with a few friends. Everyone was pleased with their dish. I am a huge fan of  Fox restaurants. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this restaurant before flying back to Dallas. It was in a nice location and the restaurant itself was set up really nice. They have a cute patio and a spacious dining area. We sat as the bar as we usually do at restaurants. This place was pretty busy when we went, but we were able to find two seats together.  Our bartender had a nice personality and was on her game. She was the only one working back there, so she was having to make drinks for everyone at the bar and everyone sitting at tables. Not a huge deal, but definitely helped cause a longer wait time for things than would probably be the case if she had someone else helping. Still, she was attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed.  We ordered wine which was good and priced about the same as every other restaurant we had checked out in the area. We also ordered a cheese board with two delicious cheeses. One I had never tried before  and was happy that it was on the menu. The portion size was a little small for the price, but it was still tasty.  We also got the house soft pretzels and provolone fondue. Let me just say, you get a ton. We probably should have done just the cheese or just the pretzels and fondue because you ended up getting so many pretzels. They were awesome though. A lot of people in our area had ordered them, so you know they're doing something right.  I'd love to come back to this place if I was ever in the area again."}
{"text":"A must when in Phoenix! I moved here 4 months ago and this is by far the best place I've been to since relocating here. I went for lunch and ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and the turkey pastrami on a pretzel bun as my entree. Highly recommend this sandwich! So, so delicious!"}
{"text":"From start to finish, The Arrogant Butcher was the perfect choice for our small group. There were about 8 of us, and we were lucky enough to be seated in the semi-private booth/banquette area in the back, and fortunate enough to be treated to lovely service throughout our visit. The atmosphere is so cool and definitely not what an out-of-towner who is clearly out-of-touch with how downtown Phoenix has changed was expecting. Our local person, who brought us here, explained that all of the Fox Restaurant Concepts locations have a slick vibe without coming across as contrived.  While the name \"Arrogant Butcher\" might imply an overabundance of cured meats on the menu, I was happy to see that there were many fresh options as well, for both the vegetarians as well as the non-salami eaters. We overlooked the appetizer menu (although I've heard the pretzels with provolone fondue are amazing) and went right for the cheese and charcuterie boards, passing those around the table as we enjoyed our drinks. There's a healthy selection of hosue-crafted cocktails and a nice wine selection, but the on-draught beers are lacking a bit. To accompany your meats-and-cheese boards, there are many \"Extras\" you can add for a well-rounded experience, such as Marcona almonds, cornichons, peppers, etc. It's a great way to have a more social appetizer with your group as you wait for entrees.  While meat-based mains range from seafood to ribs to chicken to New Zealand Sea Bass, there's also a nice selection of vegetarian items, such as Sweet Potato Tortelli. Personally, I opted for one of their big entree salads, and was really happy with the Tabbouleh Salad. My coworkers raved about the NZ Sea Bass, the Short Ribs, the Pork Carnitas, and the signature AB Cheeseburger.  Their desserts are also worth the cost of admission and the calories. We shared one of each of the 4 desserts; each item is $6 and a nice portion. My personal favorite was the Warm Peanut Butter Cup with chocolate gelato.  Definitely a cool, hip spot for small groups with varying tastes and varying budget per diems, but also a nice spot for when someone else is footing the bill!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. It's nothing special either. Avoid the meat & cheese appetizers...way overpriced. If there's no wait to get in, it's worth trying while you're downtown. Otherwise, go somewhere else and save yourself the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went last night for the first time, love the atmosphere and the service as well as the food were amazing! Will definitely go back when we come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My best meal so far in Phoenix. I had the Short Rib Stew served with a really good cornbread muffin. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. The highlight of the night was the salted caramel pudding (we ordered two more). I would come back just for that. Our server was cool and we got our food timely. If ever in Phoenix again, I'll be stopping by."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great.  Only two options at lunch for specials.  The fish tacos served a large portion of fish. Great fresh  pick de gallo with a slaw. The white beans on the side were outstanding.  The other special, the cheese burger was good but too well done and dry.  The service was fantastic especially for a party of 12. The menu had appetizers, soup (chicken noodle) which was raved about, and salads, but no sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, once to dine with friends on a Friday night and another for my best friend's rehearsal dinner. Both times, it was packed and the food was good! I love their cocktails and of course, the famous soft pretzels + fondue appetizer {literally a must!}.   The last time I went, I tried their crab stuffed chicken. I loved the sauce because duh, it has capers in it. However, the crab was a tiny bit fishy the time that I had it. I'm really sensitive with fishy things so I ended up scooping it out of the chicken and giving it to my fiance.   I've also had their roasted beet salad with chicken for an entree {this is great because you can over-indulge in the pretzels} and I loved it! I would absolutely order it again.   I usually recommend Arrogant Butcher to friends who are visiting and staying in DT Phoenix. I'm sure we'll be back eventually {like when i'm craving pretzels and cheese}!"}
{"text":"What's the big deal about this place?! Over-rated truly. The food was 'okay' but nothing to be wowed about."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Turkey pastrami sandwich was fantastic, also tried the salad and fries. Everything was superb, highly recommended! If you're going with a group of people, recommend you make reservations.  Just fyi, the only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 is because the service wasn't the best when I was there. Bartenders and even the hostess were rather inattentive. Also, this is not the best place for vegetarians (one of my colleagues who I was having dinner with was a vegetarian.... not many options)."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and ate at the bar - really friendly staff. The bartender was very attentive and she suggested food and drinks that I may like. The Pink Drink was awesome. Don't order an appetizer if you plan to eat an entree - they are huge! I had the pretzels and fondue. Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Cool spot in downtown Phoenix.  Lively decor and atmosphere.  Nothing about it felt arrogant, but friendly and warm.  We had a reservation, but the Thursday night that we were there, tables were not hard to come across.  My party of four ladies decided on a charcuterie platter and some zucchini fritters to start and a few glasses of wine.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  She whipped those us for us right away.  Then we ordered.  My  3 companions all had salads, salmon, green, BBQ Chicken.  They all seemed to enjoy theirs.  I went rogue and ordered the special, fried chicken.  Whoa.  The portion was huge.  Totally shareable.  It also came served over a honey drenched biscuit and coleslaw.  I nibbled on all three, but was full much faster than I'd hoped.  The chicken was flavorful, but not as crunchy as I like it.  The biscuit was my favorite.  I enjoyed the charcuterie plate quite a bit and the wine selection was respectable, so I sampled a few glasses and was pleased with my choices.  Overall a solid spot with hearty food served in hearty portions.  Prices are fair, ambiance is fun and service is great!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  Part of the fox restaurant concepts which are all good places for food and beverage. Busy atmosphere but still accommodates a business lunch!  Great place for happy hour and it is close to the stadiums and walking distance from my place of work.  Tiffany is a great server friendly and always on her game.  The food was outstanding and I recommend their Italian sandwich!  I look forward to me next business lunch or happy hour at the \"butcher\""}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a place like this arrive in downtown.  The food, service and atmosphere are all amazing.  Please send your business to this and other downtown restaurants and shops so that more businesses move into the area."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher is a gastropub restaurant in Downtown Phoenix.  It's within walking distance to the theater and sports arena.  Parking is available in the nearby parking structure.  It's $10 but you can get it validated.  We were in town for the weekend and needed to find a place to have dinner.  This spot caught my attention with the catchy name.    We came here on a busy Friday night at 8pm.  Everyone was out and about dining and grabbing a drink to unwind. Luckily it was a 30 minute wait since we chose outdoor seating.  It was nice because the weather was warm and breezy.  The hostess was nice.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  She checked on us throughout the meal.   It was a no meat Friday so our options were limited.  We ordered the raw oysters on a half shell. Not the freshest but you can't complain since it's AZ.  We are spoiled because of being in a coastal state.  Seafood is much better.   For our entrees, we had the almond crusted rainbow trout.  It was ok served with sautéed green beans, potato purée and brown butter.  The grilled salmon is the better choice.  Smoky flavor and flaky texture.  I prefer this over the trout.  Also served with the same sides.   The seafood is just average.  I want to come back to try the meat entrees.  Especially the crab stuffed chicken and Jambalaya.  On our next trip, we will definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience at The Arrogant Butcher. Having been there before, I chose it as a restaurant to bring some friends from out of town to. This was a party of nine. All women.   At first experience was fine. A little bit slow but definitely not anything I would've complained about. When it came time for the bill, one woman was brought an individual check and everything else was put on one check. We realized there must've been a miscommunication in discussing the bill. I asked the waitress, Monica, if she would please split the check so everybody could have their own bill as we were all separate. She immediately declined and said we should have told her at the beginning that we wanted separate checks. She said that we could do the math for each item we ordered and write our names of the top of the receipt totaling what each of us got to the corresponding debit card name.  While I did feel like this was a little bit ridiculous, we all complied.   One of my friends leaned over to another friend and said that the waitress just being lazy. Those same friends, after doing their math, got up went to the bathroom. The waitress followed them into the bathroom and began to yell and scream at one of them. She then came out and hysterically yelled and screamed at me as well. I kept trying to give her the check that we had taken the time to total out each patron's menu items but she refused to accept it. She said she was transferring us to the bar and wanted nothing more to do with our table. I had to personally flag down the manager even though he was made well aware of the situation. I actually had to flag him down twice before he finally came to talk to our table. Meanwhile, we still had not been given the opportunity to pay our bill.   My friend who was yelled at in the bathroom explained what happened to the manager and he made no apology. He kept saying it was an unfortunate situation and he wished it hadn't happened. He also kept trying to change the subject and asking her how she liked the food. He said he wish there was something he could do to make it better. I kept saying that an apology would make it a lot better but he would not do it. He then left for a few minutes and came back saying he was going to give half off of everyone's bill. I told him that while that was very generous, that was not what we were looking for. It would be very nice if he gave our table an apology. He still kept repeating that it was unfortunate and he wished it hadn't happened. Towards the very end of our confrontation, he said he apologized for the situation. It took us an hour and a half just to pay our check. During that time nobody refilled her waters or did anything even near our table. We were just trapped there and made to feel like we did something wrong. While my one friend admits that she should not have said the waitress was lazy, and she did apologize for that, I feel our table was treated extremely unfairly and rude by your establishment. The fact that the manager had no reaction to a waitress following a customer into the bathroom and screaming at her was shocking and appalling. I love Fox restaurants and I was so disappointed to not only be treated that way, but also to have my out-of-town guests screamed at by a waitress."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here for lunch today. We got here before the rush which was definitely a good idea. They filled up with businessmen and women around noon.  The staff was super friendly and good looking (seems to be a FOX thing). I liked their outfits: crisp, white button down shirts and a tie, jeans, and Converse.   The food was really good and came out in a timely manner. My friend got the special which was a pork sandwich w/fries and I got the fish sandwich w/a side salad. My sandwich was really tasty. The fish was flaky and the sauce it came with was delectable. The salad came pretty much dry so I had to ask for extra dressing, which I received promptly and tasted really good. My friend enjoyed her sandwich. I really liked her fries as well, which are made fresh there (think elevated In and Out fries). My strawberry lemonade was really yummy too, but unfortunately, didn't come with free refills.  I loved the interior, like I do most FOX restaurants. My favorite part was a room off to the side that had comfy looking tables with nice booths and a ton of pictures all over the walls.  I'd definitely go back here, especially for a business meeting or possibly a first date."}
{"text":"We decided to try out The Arrogant Butcher last night for my husband's birthday. Unfortunately we made the decision last minute and couldn't make a reservation.  If it hadn't been for the Josh Groban concert I'm sure we wouldn't have waited an hour for table.    However, even though we waited for an hour for a table, the food and service were pretty good. I would give the food 5 stars, the service 4 and the atmosphere 4.    We were worried the portion sizes would be small based on some reviews/pictures here, but we did not find that to be the case. We ended up taken half our food home because we couldn't finish it.    We ordered the soft pretzels with provolone dipping sauce, jambalaya and the beef short rib stew.  All three were EXCELLENT.  The kitchen/our server didn't get the soft pretzels out to us until after we were served our entrees but they were so good it didn't matter.  Our food was out less than 15 minutes after ordering.  The cornbread that came with the stew was amazing.  It was filled with corn and green chilies. It was a very sweet and savory corn bread and it was divine.    We don't drink, but it seemed like people were enjoying their drinks. The bar was packed and overflowing.    We will definitely be back - there are quite a few things I wouldn't mind trying including the desserts - warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato? Yes, please. We would have ordered it last night but we were so full we couldn't fathom eating another bite.  My advice - Make a reservation.  The food is worth it."}
{"text":"We love Fox concept restaurants but the Arrogant Butcher is a little overrated. It's not bad by any means but I think the real value is in the cheaper menu options. The location is great and it's a perfect spot before events downtown but I don't think the higher end food items meet the price points. Last time we were there we got some seafood and it was pretty bland. Considering dinner was close to $150 I was not impressed. The turkey pastrami sandwich on the pretzel bun however is awesome! Stick with the lunch items and go somewhere else for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Four stars. There were so many people and we waited for a long time. All of us were very hungry but what we can do is wait... Finally the food were served, luckily the food were delicious. The waiters are friendly too. Next time must have a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"Good food but very slow to seat our party. They told us it would be 30 minutes but we waited at the bar for over an hour. Different parties (with a large number of people) that came after us were getting seated before us. It wasn't until we kept complaining to the hostess that she found a table to seat us."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Saturday night! This place is lively, with good music and excellent service. Our waitress was very helpful and nice. For appetizers we ordered pita and hummus and the crispy shrimp! The pita was oh so soft!!!! Best pita I have ever had. Shrimp was pretty tasty tooo! For mains, I ordered the turkey Pastrami! Loved the salad it came with and the brioche bun was really soft. My friend ordered ribs And they were amaaaazing!! We were happy with everything we ordered! And I might just drop by again for the ribs!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place when in Phoenix for work. It gets busy when the Suns are playing.  I enjoyed the fish and chips, big portion, enough on it's own. Excellent fish.  Prior to eating the fish I tried one of the meats from the charcuterie selection, which was less impressive. Decent service."}
{"text":"I have to give it up to this place, it really impressed.  It has a good vibe and a great atmosphere.  Wife and I met another couple for a double date and everyone was impressed.  We ordered a sampler and everyone got a bit, very good.  I ordered the meatloaf and I have to say it blew me away, so good.   If you want a fresh experience and have some coin to drop I would recommend highly."}
{"text":"Where are you ?  The AB is jam packed on a Saturday night. Service is SPOT ON, these guys know the menu forwards and backwards.   Our Butcher's Plattter appetizer will get the evening started off in the right direction .  My Fish and Chips are one the way. Kilt Lifter beer is FABULOUS.  HAPPY !!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this.  The deviled eggs were delicious. Caesar salad had a bit too much radicchio making it a little bitter but it was a nice alternative to a caesar. Also had the chicken stroganoff that was tasty with homemade noodles."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! The food is always amazing. The service is hit or miss and sometimes the wait times are quite long, especially if there is an event in downtown Phoenix, but the food is always excellent. We have never ordered something we didn't like and we always recommend this place to those visiting from out of town. How can you turn down pretzels and cheese fondue? The only negative comment I could possibly write is that we are always too full after appetizers and a main course to get something for dessert. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for good American food and it keeps us coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Is Hard Rock Cafe really still in business? With The Arrogant Butcher across the street I just can't imagine why. The hubby and I stopped by The Arrogant Butcher before a Suns game and had an AWESOME experience there. Our goal was to try a few different appetizers and that turned out to be more than enough food for two.   House Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue=the best thing that ever happened to me. Artichoke Hummus=unique flavor that goes beyond your regular ol' hummus Crispy Rock Shrimp=damn good  Potato Fritters=worth the drive from Chandler all on their own  I can't WAIT to go back here and try everything else on the menu. :D"}
{"text":"After much hype and having been shunned the first attempt to try the new \"it\" spot downtown by fox concepts I decided to swing in with some company from out of town and was pleasantly surprised by the time we had.  The food was great and although we only ordered appetizers we enjoyed them immensely and will be back for more and to try some of the dinner selections.   In short:  Drinks - A+ Apps - B+ Service - C-   the C- for service is due only to the fact some of the staff act as if they are above you and that they are going out of their way when seating you. It is this kind of BS that has always bothered me with some of the Fox concepts establishments, but they are tasty so i more than likely return."}
{"text":"Everything here was great and somewhat Innovative. Excellent pâté, cheese and cocktails. Desserts were the big surprise. I had the peanut butter cup and my daughter had the  caramel pudding. Two of the best desserts ever. Server was extremely helpful and patient with our questions. Will return."}
{"text":"If you've read up on any of my Yelp reviews on Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, you probably know that I pretty much repeat the same story like its a broken record.  High prices, average food.  I've actually been to Arrogant Butcher before for a light happy hour, but today was my first time dining during non-happy hour business hours.  As with other Fox restaurants, each concept has its own unique twist on classic fare.  But for all the creativity, there's simply no getting around the fact that the terms \"Sam Fox\" and \"value\" are in no way synonymous.  I came here with a couple of college friends to watch the NCAA basketball tournament around lunchtime on a Saturday.  Arrogant Butcher's bar is a good spot for such an occasion with ample TVs and ample seating at the bar and the perimeter booths.  There's also plenty of seating out on the patio and in the main restaurant area.  Its the perfect location for a meal before a big event as Chase Field and Talking Stick Arena are both just steps away.  It was pretty busy for a Saturday lunch despite no big events going on Downtown that day.    We started out by splitting their famous cheese fondue & pretzel bread appetizer.  Great for sharing and pairs great with a nice cold beer.  Unfortunately they charge twice as much for it when its not happy hour.  Still, $10 isn't completely out of line.  I had read all the Yelp reviews raving about their Short Rib Stew so I went with that.  The dish came in a little pot and a side of cornbread (see my photo).  The stew was certainly spicy thanks to an ample amount of green chiles, but overall I wasn't too impressed with the dish.  I tasted the chiles far more than I tasted the meat.  And the portion of the dish was certainly not in line with the $15 price.  I also got a pair of 16 oz beers on tap which were a ridiculous $7 each.  Really?  On the plus side, our bartender was excellent.  Kept tabs on our glasses at all times and got our food orders out to us in impressively quick fashion.  I gave him a generous tip for his efforts.  But in terms of the overall food & drink bill, you could probably get the same quality food and the same portions of it for about 20-30% less at comparable establishments.  Overall, we had a good time watching the game and the aesthetics of Arrogant Butcher (as with pretty much all Fox concepts) are very pleasant with great views of the outside and a hip modern feel inside.  But as with all Fox concepts, be aware that you'll pay extra for the privilege of taking in those aesthetics (sometimes a lot extra).  I would certainly come back here for happy hour as the prices are actually quite reasonable then and the happy hour menu includes a lot of their biggest hits (both food and drink).  But as a regular everyday sit-down restaurant, you can find a myriad of places in Downtown Phoenix that give you a better bang for your buck.  After all, Sam Fox isn't the only restaurant genius in town."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and how the food actually tastes. She recommended her three favorite items on the menu and three of her customer favorites. We chose the pretzels and cheese fondue, the turkey pastrami sandwich and the french dip sandwich; all of which were very favorable and tasty. Value equaled the price here. If I'm in PHX again, I will be sure to seek out the Arrogant Butcher again."}
{"text":"First off our waiter Jonathan was amazing! We were celebrating my dads 70th bday and they took great care of us. Everyone enjoyed their food but the place is very large so a bit loud and not a very intimate experience but still recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   I recently took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we enjoyed an amazing dinner. We started off with some cocktails and pretzel bites with cheese. I had the NY bourbon, which was rather strong, but good.   We then ordered the prosciutto and aged cheddar platter. That was also amazing and super fresh. For dinner, we split a filet mignon with creamed spinach. I can't stress enough how good and fresh all of our food was.   In terms of service. I was amazed. Our server was attentive, knowledgable, personable, and also knew when to let us enjoy ourselves without continually interrupting us. I appreciated that. She did an excellent job and the atmosphere of the restaurant was also great.   I had placed a reservation a couple of days in advance. Good thing I did because this place can get really busy. Of course it does! The food and service are both very good. So be aware of that when deciding whether or not to come on short notice.   Other than that, I would say that the parking at CityScape is straightforward and easy to find. I can't wait to come back again with my girl sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom before Cirque du Soleil at Talking Stick Arena. It's right across the street so if you need a good place to eat give Arrogant Butcher a try.  It's a Fox Concepts restaurant (Whole Foods, Flour Child, etc.) and it's consistent with their brand of a nice quality restaurant.  What makes this restaurant different that I've never seen before is that as an appetizer you can build a charcuterie plate using a menu kind of like a normal sushi menu. So you go down the list and check off cheeses, meats, veggies, nuts, spreads, and it all comes to your table. I could just eat that and wine, but we also split a sea bass which was perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned. I can't turn down dessert so I ordered the peanut butter dessert that is a creaky peanut butter dish, with dipping cookies and chocolate. Do you love peanut butter? Then order this! One last point ok the food there is no decaf cappuccino so keep that in mind if you're into that after an evening meal.  You can make a rezzie, also they validate parking if you park in the garage attached to the restaurant. I didn't see it, as I parked at Talking Stick but the waitress told us about it.  There were also private rooms for big groups.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Nice bar atmosphere and good beer selection. Sat outside on a beautiful night. The jambalaya exceeded my expectation. Very nice. Very attentive servers."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Fun atmosphere.  I've enjoyed every single thing I've had here.  Always know what you are getting when coming here.  I love that there are always great craft Drinks and pretty flawless service.  Thanks Fox!"}
{"text":"Food is great. We ordered grilled fish tacos and beef stew. Waitress is friendly."}
{"text":"Had the ribs and although the sauce, fries, and slaw were tasty the ribs were tough. And for a place called the arrogant butcher perhaps this is to be expected in a sarcastic kinda way. The bartender was super nice and the beer prices are on point. Perhaps I'm spoiled in the Bay Area foodie bubble. I would come back for drinks and to watch a game but stick to appetizers."}
{"text":"Pretzel fondue was yum but what they need to showcase is thier salted-caramel pudding. I'm convinced there's no pic on here because NO ONE can snap one before devouring it. Well played butcher, well played"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place! The staff is always nice and the food is always terrific. It's helpful when they share their thoughts on the menu and the location can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food looks very appetizing. I regret not order the half chicken BBQ plate $19. That order looked huge in comparison to my beef stew. My beef stew was alright. It cost $18 for a little portion and one corn cake.  I would rate the price here as $$$ instead of $$ because it is very pricey, as expected from a location in downtown Phoenix. I'd say the beef stew I ordered tasted like one I can get for $5 in a super market. It didn't have a lot of meat I also ordered a blueberry cheesecake. Its texture is soft, like pudding, than cheesecake, $7. My price range for this would have been $5 or less because it wasn't big either.  The CitySpace E Parking Garage right next to the rest, opposite of the big parking lot, is free for 2 hours. Just give the host the pass and they'll validate it for you. Currently, downtown is having a construction so travelling down here is rather difficult."}
{"text":"Ahhh I absolutely love the Arrogant Butcher. I go around Phoenix and Scottsdale and try other restaurants (e.g.: Citizen Public House, St Francis, The Mission etc) but I keep coming back to my first love (The Arrogant Butcher) ;) This is definitely in my top three favorite restaurants of all time, and my favorite American restaurant,no doubt.   Appetizers: I LOVE their cheese and meat plate. The cherry marmalade that comes with it pairs up perfectly with the cheeses and the meat. My favorite cheese are the cypress grove and the prairie breeze (I found both of these at AJs and can't be happier). The Black mussels are my favorite as well. The butterly/garlic sauce it comes with is so so so so good. I could eat it with absolutely anything.  Entrees: I used to order the NY strip but unfortunately, they have gotten rid of it so the next best thing is the grilled ribeye. The succotash and creamy horseradish is what makes this dish AMAZING. My boyfriend always gets the burger which he said is the best burger he has ever had. I've had the jambalaya for lunch before which I thought was just okay, but maybe that's because I was never really a fan of jambalaya.  Dessert: Their award winning salted caramel pudding. Out of this world.   They have a great selection of drinks. I always get the pink drink as I like girly/sweet tasting drinks.  I am getting hungry as I am writing this review. Can't wait to be back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is meh. The ambiance is really nice and I was able to get a seat at the bar right away! I was torn about even coming here, but seeing as I really like North which is another one of their restaurants I decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the \"pink drink\" which is their version of a Cosmo and it's really good. For a starter I had the crispy shrimp, which was essentially just fried shrimp that comes with a spicy aioli. The sauce is good but the shrimp is nothing to write home about. For my main I asked the server which would be a better choice between the fish and chips or the crab stuffed chicken, he advised that the fish and chips was the better choice. Boy was I disappointed, the batter was so thick and greasy it was disgusting and the fries weren't anything to talk about  either.  I will give this place a solid review for service and ambiance but the food I had was nothing special. Which is actually kind of sad because like I mentioned previously, I love north!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Food here is quite good.  I can't speak on the quality of the ingredients, but the dishes are well prepared, good to look at and good to ingest.  Nothing spectacularly mindblowing on the menu, but certainly things that make you say, \"Hey, sounds good\".  Really kind of dig the bar (physically) and the overall feel of the place.  Bunch of TVs, and not everything was sports (hey, sometimes it's fun to ad-lib for muted movies! - I don't care for sports in a bar generally, but some people will see that a plus).  Could do without the lack of tap selection; pretty weak overall.  Also, the gin selection is odd.  Many liquors seem to have 6-10 brands/bottles, while gin has 3 brands, 4 types (can't knock them for that though, just odd, being a gin drinker)."}
{"text":"We stay right next door at the Kimpton each time we are in downtown Phoenix and make it a point to eat here at least once during each stay. Food is delicious! I especially love the carnitas nachos. The pretzels and cheese fondant appetizer was great as well!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and we went to this restaurant because a local friend recommended it. We got sat down right away, but after that the service was not that good. We waited for a drink order, we waited for our drinks to arrive, we waited for a food order. The second drink order we had to ask twice for. I had been a server for many years in restaurants so I know when we are getting bad service. We heard the food was good, but our meals were just okay. Maybe it was an off night for this restaurant, but we will not return."}
{"text":"Looks like I'm not going along with the majority here. I experienced JUST happy hr here a few months ago and was not happy with the service. The bartender was very unpleasant and not quick on her feet. Needless to say the hh drink specials can be hugely improved. Very weak selection. The food on the other-hand was good. We ordered the soft pretzel bites $5 which can feed a family of 4! and the antipasto platter was not as good. There was only 2 slices of tiny bread to eat with the cheeses, jams, etc..if I didn't have the pretzels I would have been pissed. Brussel sprouts came along side antipasto, they were prepared in a balsamic like marinade and were pretty damn great! Prob would go back fro pretzels and brussel sprouts but that's abt it."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my girlfriend. Had a reservation and was sat immediately. Very cool looking place. Waiter seemed uninterested in the beginning which was a little off putting. My girlfriend got the chop salad as a appetizer, which she thoroughly enjoyed. She got the NY strip and I got the filet mignon. The char on the filet was perfect, the spinach bed it was presented on was just as tasty, the potato was... tiny. I also got the polish ____, which was refreshing. The waiter eventually warmed up. Overall a good dinner, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Very accommodating staff. I'd recommend this place for a reliable excellent food and service especially if you are going to an event down town. The manager of this place, Nat, is a great guy."}
{"text":"The only thing arrogant about the butcher's selections at The Arrogant Butcher was the lack of butchered meat. One small menu of heavily priced charcuterie options. That's it.  We arrived during happy hour thinking we totally scored on drink specials. Our server explained in detail that the happy hour drinks were of a lesser quality than the regular menu drinks. That's not happy hour. That's ordering a well drink.  We ordered the pretzel bites as an appetizer. They arrived 5 minutes AFTER we finished eating our meal. For dinner I had the sweet potato tortellini with mushrooms and spinach that wasn't half bad. For dessert we got the salted caramel pudding due to it's high recommendation. It left us very unsatisfied and even more disappointed in our dining experience. I don't think we will be back to The Arrogant Butcher."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable dinner last night before a play at the Orpheum. Ordered the pretzels and fondue because of previous posts.  They were really good!  Four of us had 3 different entrees and all were delicious. The salty caramel pudding is a perfect ending to the meal!  Servers gave helpful menu advice and good service and also had fun personalities!  All and all a fine experience."}
{"text":"Every time I visit downtown Phoenix, I am here.  I love this place.  I love sitting at the bar or on the patio on a nice day.  They have great service and even better food/drinks!   Go there, I will continue to do so!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great spot to meet up with friends!! Lovely environment & extremely friendly service. Drinks are elegant & refreshing. Appetizers were delightfully displayed on our table, almost too perfect to eat!!! Amazing night out!!!"}
{"text":"Just another chain, friendly, lively place for groups to gather, not thrilled with the Prime Rib, will try it again and order something else.  A 5-Star Foidue"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining at the Arrogant Butcher two weeks ago to celebrate my birthday. After another restaurant \"lost\" my reservation  was unable to accommodate my party of 16, I desperately called AB trying to fit my party in. The event coordinate was fantastic and set up my group immediately. When we arrived for dinner we  were seated in Andy's section. He was absolutely amazing. So kind, so thoughtful and incredibly attentive. My birthday was during Phoenix Comicon so he was slammed with tables. He made us feel like we were the only group he was taking care of the entire night. Not only was the service fantastic, but the food was incredible. Every course from the appetizers to dessert was better than the next. I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"Got a booth right away and it was such a neat place. Loved the charcuterie option. Must get the nachos and pretzel bites. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the menu here. The place has a gastro pub type vibe, and the food is all presented nicely and is plated with care. They have a nice cocktail menu and the drinks came out fast. We shared the butchers platter and it was truly yummy. Apart from Postino's, probably my next fave in the area. Salami's, prosciutto, cheeses, olives, chutney- it had it all and was the perfect thing to pick at while conversing and enjoying some drinks. If you sit on the patio or at the window, there is some great people watching opportunities too, since you are in the heart of downtown.  My only criticism is how packed it got the evening we were there. It got really difficult to order a drink at the bar and there didn't seem to be any system to make it any easier for the customers. This wasn't the case when we were here at lunch time, but when we got back around 10pm. I would just take heed of that advice if some large event is happening downtown when you visit."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I only had charcuterie, mussels and cocktails on the patio here.  However, it was still a STRONG showing.  The patio has a great view in downtown near a lot of hotels, the staff was awesome and the only disappointing thing of the night was that they had run out of oysters... oh, tear!  The cocktails were also tasty and if I were this butcher... I would be arrogant too.. for good reason!   I would absolutely come back here again and would love to try a main course!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, great food and great atmosphere. I would definitely come back here for another date night. They validate parking as well. Bonus!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great location, awesome service, and the food is rich, hearty comfort food.  Just by the name, you automatically know that this is NOT a place for Vegans or Vegetarians, let alone in someone who's on a plant based diet.   I've been here twice, once for lunch and again for dinner, big time in a group and it was just plain good. Can get busy, so if you walk in at a peak time, you may have to wait 15 - 20 minutes, so if you're on a schedule its best to book in advance. No parking validation is probably my only gripe as its downtown diagonally across from the Talking Stick Arena where the Phoenix Suns and Mercury play so you may end up either paying an arm and a leg to park or have a bit of a walk. GameChanger: Look for an area that is a short distance away that you don't have to pay to park and use an Uber, Lyft or other ride share.  May be cheaper than parking and if you strategically park in a location that is safe, but can get you out of the traffic that is leaving faster. It could be a win-win."}
{"text":"Upon looking at the Yelp rating and the volume of reviews, I wanted to eat here at least once during our visit in Arizona. We arrived here on a weekday lunch during prime time and were seated immediately.   Our server was very nice and provided us with recommendations - I wish I remembered her name! For food, we ordered the grilled steak salad and the jambalaya. The food tasted fine, but nothing too exceptional. To be really honest, I was very disappointed with the portion in comparison to the price point. For my steak salad, I literally felt so hungry after which is never usually the case. The jambalaya portion could've been a little more generous as well.  I think this place was a decent restaurant but there's nothing about this place that would urge me to return."}
{"text":"Great service, decent happy hour, and fantastic salad! I had the chicken tabouleh salad and, although that sounds uneventful, I think it was the best chicken salad I have ever had. The chicken was char-grilled to perfection, and the dressing a perfect match. My waiter was attentive and genuinely polite.   Also, the ambiance is hip or what-not, if you're looking for that kind of thing :)  From a visitor from out of town, this was a nice welcome meal to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food. A little pricy but I guess that's how things are in downtown PHX"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and drinks and left with an overall feeling of average.  It was a weekday afternoon and the restaurant was not very busy.  We sat at the bar and felt the service was ok at best.  The bartender did't really seem to care or want to be at work.  The beer list isn't that great and I was underwhelmed with my cocktail of choice, \"The Polish Fix\".  Not bad but not delicious like I expect a good quality (expensive) mixed drink to be.  For food we shared the Butcher's Platter.  It was a large size, plenty for two people to share.  The platter consisted of meats, cheeses, bread, and other extras.  The platter was tasty, I enjoyed the majority of items  provided."}
{"text":"I really debated on giving 2 or 3 stars because it wasn't terrible but it was disappointing enough that we probably wont go back.  My husband and I tried this place a couple weeks ago since we love other fox concepts and now live in phoenix.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype for us. Everything was...okay. But for $74 after dinner and a tip we expected more.  Pros: Service was attentive but not overbearing. I asked her for a drink recommendation telling her I prefer vodka and she recommended the Pink Drink which was tasty.   We started with the pretzels which were delish. They are the same as are served at culinary dropout so that was a safe bet and didnt disappoint.   They validate parking if you use the garage attached to the building.  Cons: Other than my drink and our pretzel bites, the food was very underwhelming.   First off, everything needed salt and a lot of it. We both went to town with the salt shaker.   I had the fish and chips. They were very under seasoned and a little too greasy but otherwise okay. My husband had the beef stew. He said the jalapeno corn muffin was the best part of his meal and even adding salt didnt help it much.  So definitely not the most disappointing experience but for 20 dollars or more per plate, we will pass on future visits."}

{"text":"I came in today with a group of 22 colleagues for a last minute holiday lunch. The service was outstanding even with such a large group. Drinks were kept full and the food came out fast! As always, the food was great and at the end, Chip (our server) split the bill for all guests! I don't know another restaurant that would have accommodated us the way they did!"}
{"text":"Attended a birthday party here.  We were a party of twelve.  The hostess told us that another group took our table by claiming to be our birthday boy.  Thank you Arrogant Butcher for the royal fcuk up.  Our group sat at three separate tables.  Uncool.  Cocktails:  Pimms Cup (good), Old Fashioned (good)  Dinner:  Turkey Sloppy Joe (good), Side salad (good)  That's all I have to say.  I have to cool down from the unfortunate event that spoiled the evening before I return."}
{"text":"OMG, had the crab stuffed chicken and it was excellent but not as good as my son's jambalaya!!!  That was freaking incredible!  The drinks are very strong and well worth the buzz!!!  Atmosphere is wonderful and our waitress, not only was she very attractive, but she was very, very attentive without being impatient.  Highly recommend to anyone coming to Phoenix!!!  Oh, and you have got to try the salted caramel pudding...you died and went to heaven!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and awesome service.  Just be prepared to wait a while for tables to turn over. Maybe we went on a busy weekend but overall good food. We ordered the pretzels and fondue and zucchini fritters."}
{"text":"This was a fun place for lunch per the suggestion of my friend Jose from Portland. I had a Turkey Ruben on a pretzel style bun. Very flavorful. Coleslaw was really good with the apple pieces mixed in but I would have preferred it a little finer chop and a little juicier.  My friend Jose had the split Pea soup and said it was good, but to me it looked too much like soup and not a thick traditional style split pea so just be prepared for that. Since they make their own bread pretzel type rolls there some bread and butter to dip in to the soup would have been a brilliant idea.  The battered fish and chips (I assume it was beer battered cause it looked that way) looked awesome and I would probably try that next time.  The atmosphere is cool and fun. American modern and comfortable.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"My one (and likely only) experience at The Arrogant Butcher was for happy hour, and it was one of the best mixes of food, drink, and value I have ever had. My friend and I were in town for a WWE event at the US Airways Arena, and decided to stop in here for food and drinks beforehand. We took a spot at the bar and was pleased to see a great selection of Happy Hour specials - both food and drink.  We ordered the house soft pretzels with cheese dip ($5) and the Antipasti plate ($8) to share, and each ordered one of their toasts ($4) - my friend went with the roasted peppers and boursin cheese, and I opted for the chicken liver pate. The soft pretzel order was HUGE - I've seen portions half the size for much more at brewpubs - and were DELICIOUS. The toasts were a nice surprise - ample portions, and great quality ingredients. The chicken liver pate was divine - so smooth and creamy. The Antipasti plate provided an ample portion of meats and cheeses, all great quality. At $11/person, we were happily stuffed with bar munchies of the highest caliber.  Beer selection here is limited, but they do offer some decent options. Guinness, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, an IPA from Deschutes, and their local selection was the famous Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, that seemed to be everywhere I went in Phoenix. (They also had a Hefeweizen, but I don't remember where from.) At $3 for the local brew and $4 for the others, this is a great Happy Hour option.   I'd love to try them for dinner, but I can't imagine when/if I will be in Phoenix again. For happy hour, I give them my highest of recommendations."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch while on a business trip.  They have great food and artfully crafted cocktails.  The decor has a clean industrial quality to it.  They have a great outdoor patio near a plaza that would make a great people watching spot.  The crowd was a blend of business people, families and couples.  I imagine this place is pretty jumping in the evening.  I will definitely come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Service was great-they validate parking and the waiter brought us iced water to go as we were walking out. Food was good too. I ordered a beef stew and it was delishhh"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to stop by for a while. Finally made it. Ordered the smoked carnitas nachos with 2 old fashions to start.  They were great. Then I had the most perfect medium prime rib ever. Hubby had the short rib stew. He loved it. Paired with a delicious Pinot noir. Wonderful dinner. The place is literally next to everything downtown. We're staying next door at the Palomar hotel and walking distance to cityscape. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal in both food and service. I absolutely loved the fillet steak. The service was phenomenal. I highly recommend the cheese plate as well!! Make sure you save room for dessert and the peanut butter cup. Our server Ian was truly exceptional!! He was truly one of the very best servers that I have ever had! I would highly recommend this restaurant. We had the pleasure to meet the Service Manager and General Manager both of which was truly customer service oriented and invested in service excellence!!"}
{"text":"The portions were very disappointing, but then the check turned out to be lower than I thought it would be.  I wasn't starving today so it didn't bother me as much.  Maybe I'll try something else there and update my review later.  We had the salmon and the filet mignon.  The salmon was overly salted and overcooked - super \"sticky\" chew.  We did enjoy the creamed corn sauce it came with.  The filet was cooked perfectly.  The presentation was nice and cute but it kind of made me laugh when they first arrived on the table.  It was like straight out of a cartoon.  For dessert, we enjoyed the chocolate cake which was pretty delicious.  It was very moist and the little bits of salt was nice.  I'm more of a chocolate freak though and it didn't hit my spot but my friend thought it was the best he'd ever had.    All in all, I'd like to try a couple more things before I change my review.  There were a lot of interesting items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had to check off another place from my list before we headed home.   SERVICE - Our waiter was really nice! He made our dinner very enjoyable.   FOOD Pretzels & Cheese - They are very generous with their pretzels and cheese portions. In San Diego, we usually only get maybe four pieces out of what they gave us here. And we are used  to getting cheese in a tiny little bowl. Here, you actually get enough cheese to finish your pretzels!   Fish Tacos - This was okay. Always on a fish taco hunt but these are standard. Nothing spectacular.   AB Cheeseburger - There was a different flavor to the sauce that they used but I can put my finger on it. It was an overall solid burger.   I can see this spot being a great one when there is a game! Very convenient."}
{"text":"What a fun, yet very noisy restaurant! Went last night with family and friends and I was surprised at how busy and NOISY it was for a Tuesday night.   Food was great. We enjoyed the pretzels and the zucchini fritters for an appetizer. The pretzels and cheese fondue were awesome...like I could take a bath in that cheese sauce kind of good. The zucchini fritters were just ok and the dipping sauce tasted too much like tartar sauce so it wasn't my fav. I enjoyed the scallops while the rest of my companions has the jambalaya and the pork carnitas. All were really tasty. The scallops were perfectly done and a good size. We also enjoyed the peanut butter chocolate gelati for dessert. It was superb.   Service was very good and prompt. Our drinks were kept full and I love that. This will definitely be in my arsenal of places to go downtown when I head there for events, but definitely keep in mind--it's NOISY."}
{"text":"Bad experience. I have been here several times and LOVED everything. Something has happened... First of all we were sat 40 minutes after our reservations. We ordered Moscow mules but they did not have enough copper cups and one person got a glass. The drinks were spot on for the first round but undrinkable after that. The service was poor. My NY strip was average, similar to an Outback steak. My brother in law did not have his ordered delivered. The manger came out to apologize but his speech sounded \"canned\" as though he had been saying the same thing all night. One of our favorite appetizers is the pretzels, again disappointing when the insides were cold, they normally taste freshly baked. Many items were taken off our bill but for average food and poor service a bill for over $300 seemed steep. Overall I am so sad, this was my favorite restaurant and consistent great food was delivered in the past, not sure what happened but I will not return until I hear things have changed."}
{"text":"We ordered the swordfish, chicken pasta, hummus and daily soup (loaded baked potato). Soup was uninspiring but the hummus was loaded with tomatoes and artichokes was tasty. The swordfish was delicious, but didn't come with much else. The chicken pasta was good, but too simple for the price. I'm not from Tuscon, but I was expecting more from a restaurant located downtown for the prices. Go for the drinks though. The old fashioned is good and strong and worth the price. The polish fix is strong but less bitter flavor."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment. Had heard this was a great place but they were way understaffed to handle the customers. Sat at the bar and waited a long time before anyone came over. It appears the problem was that the two bartenders were making all the drinks for entire restaurant and the people at the bar suffered. Same comments from other guests sitting on either side of our party.  Food was fine, not great. Will definitely look for other options next trip downtown."}
{"text":"Depending on what you order the taste can be bland (like my dry over cooked crab stuffed chicken) or very moist and flavorful (the green chili rib stew was surprisingly flavorful). The pretzel app was good but nothing to rave about. The cheese was mild and the pretzels soft. The fix and tall blonde drinks again were good but nothing rave worthy. Environment is a little loud and on the trendy side. Nice evening, good service."}
{"text":"I love a good Fox restaurant. Let's be honest. They rarely let you down. I've been trying for months to get downtown to go to Arrogant Butcher, and was so excited when we finally had the time.   The decoration, as we've come to expect from Fox, was phenomenal. What a beautiful space. The pretzel fondue, while identical to the dish at Culinary Dropout, was just as delicious in it's reincarnation at Butcher.   The food was delicious, burgers cooked to perfection, the turkey sloppy joe is hearty and stays together, making it rather \"unsloppy\", etc.   The reason for my 2 star rating lies with the service. We made requests that were minor (no mayo, no lettuce, etc.), and every single edit we made was ignored. Usually an easy fix, when we brought it to the waiter's attention we were met with lots of attitude and not a lot of assistance. It's unfortunate, because downtown desperately needs more interesting and tasty options, and this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"A good restaurant that (barely) failed  to live up to its hype.  The good: 1) Really lively / trendy place, great for hanging out for drinks.   2) Good beer and cocktail selection.   3) Wait staff was very friendly.   4) The sea bass was very good.  The improvement areas: 1) Hostess team significantly under-estimated wait time for a table.  Not helpful as we had a business commitment later that evening.  This created a rushed experience 2)  Food was good, but didn't live up to the hype.  Interesting, creative menu, but lacking 'fillers' to go with the expensive fancy entrees.   Overall, good place for happy hour and when dining on the company's dime."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for a while. We've been to several of the other Fox restaurants. All have delicious food. This one is the exception. First when you walk in you are overwhelmed by the size and magnitude of the place. It's is huge, cold, very warehouse like. It reminded us of a Cheesecake Factory or TGI Friday's. Big cookie cutter chain restaurants. Second, the food was nothing spectacular. We had the salmon dish which we could get anywhere else. We also tried the beef short rib stew. I counted 4 small chunks of beef in the whole pot. It's more of a vegetable stew.  The blueberry cheesecake was yummy. Third, the service was rushed and robot like. \"Get'm in. Get'm out\".  All in all, we will NOT be coming back. Not worth the money, time, or experience."}
{"text":"We have been to almost all the fox restaurants here in Phoenix and have never been disappointed. This was the first time we were. Most of the food items were outstanding. My husband had the jambalaya our friends had the New York strip, and we shared the pretzel fondue and the mussels.  Plus for desert we all had the salted caramel pudding. All of these items were delicious. I had the carnitas and it was very mediocre. There was hardly any meat and it was in round balls, the corn cakes were slightly burnt, and the greens over powered the flavors. The service was alright he kept leaving too quickly and we ended up having to ask other waiters for things. This might be a one off situation so I would go back again and hopefully wont be disapointed."}
{"text":"Both me and my friend had the grilled salmon. It came with broccolini and loaded mashed potatoes. We both cleaned our plates. So I'm guessing it was good lol. The meal is smothered in a bacon gravy sauce type of marinade so i had them omit it from my plate being pescatarian but it looks yummy. We both had dessert as well. I tried the blueberry cheesecake and he had salted caramel pudding. The cheesecake came in a bowl which was cool and unexpecting. Both were delicious. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had the pork carnitas, very good!  The pretzel bite appetizers were amazing.  The pink drink was delish!"}
{"text":"I came in before Adele! The host stand was prompt and polite. They opened and greeted me at the door really making me feel welcome. After an appropriate wait we got a booth in the main dining room. Xavier greeted us and told us about all the features of the evening and all of his favorites. Our meal arrived in a timely fashion and it was delicious. The manager Nat even came by to check on our table. Even though it was super busy our service was excellent! See you soon!!!"}
{"text":"After walking to another restaurant I found on Yelp (and it being closed, that was a whole other review) and it was closed, I stumbled upon The Arrogant Butcher.  This is probably not a chain, but still has the vibe of one (which are not my particular favorite type of place) this turned out to be a great find.  Perfectly located across from the baseball field, they offered an excellent menu, and a good selection of local brews. The turkey pastrami sandwich I had which was recommended by the bartender was great. I was concerned about the pretzel bun, which I asked was it a tough bun, turned out to be awesome! He assured me that it wasn't and was right on!!  Very helpful and pleasant bartender!  Again not my type of place but I was pleasantly surprised and impressed!"}
{"text":"4 stars for service, 4 for atmosphere ( loud, live vibe) 3.5 for food.  The restaurant is known for making comfort food with a twist...I had the Ciopinno, it was very good but had pasta added to it, which was an unexpected surprise! My husband had the sea bass that was good as well but had a lot of accompaniments on top."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Good variety of food and an extensive beer list. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Typical Fox restaurant only with worse service. Food is decent but over-priced. Service is terrible. I've gotten take out here several times and they put you on hold forever, take 30 minutes to make a salad, forget to put dressing in, etc. Thank goodness there are more restaurants opening downtown so I don't have to resort to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent steak. We ordered the prime ribs and it's just so delicious: juicy with a balance of meat and fat. It melts in your mouth. The sauce coming with the dish fits really well too.  We also tried the oysters, which are fresh and aromatic. Just refreshing and the 2 sauces coming with it perfect the dish."}
{"text":"It was a really a 3 1/2 star. It took 20 minutes to get our first drink, so we weren't willing to get a second drink. My Old Fashioned arrived less than a minute before our food arrived and my husband's beer didn't arrive until after the food arrived. My husband liked his burger, but wasn't a fan of the bun (just personal preference ). The fries tasted much better than they looked. My Short Rib Green Chile was quite tasty and the Corn Bread was yummy. Service was good. They could have turned up the AC."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people find this place appealing. Our table had 7 different entrees and the butchers plate. The entrees came well before the appetizer and the only one of them that was decently good was the hamburger. Way overpriced with mediocre service and unimpressive steaks and seafood. I would not eat here again, even if the prices were slashed in half"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, wasn't very impressed. Overrated, food was ok nothing special to right home about, but we did kill the extra time we had before our show."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My family and I stopped in here before a basketball game for some dinner and were pleasantly surprised! We started out with the pretzel bread and provolone fondu, amazing! We had to force ourselves to stop eating then so we could have room for dinner. For dinner we had the scallops, they were delicious and as soft as butter, some of the best we've ever had. The sea bass was filled with flavor and very tender. We also had the chicken stroganoff, a great pasta dish with a white sauce and vegetables. I will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I love the arrogant butcher. This restaurant is in the perfect downtown Phoenix location. If you are planning to eat here prior to a concert, suns game or baseball game, be sure to make a reservation well in advance. Items on the menu I have tried and love include the zucchini fritters, crispy shrimp, grilled salmon and the heirloom beet salad. For dessert, the warm peanut butter cup is delicious! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best sandwiches I've had.  Welcomed by three great representatives- Jenn/ Desiree and Katie and the service by Tyler was perfect!! Try the Chicken Club---hmmmmmm ok. OMG it was truly delicious!!! Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher has a good vibe and friendly staff, however, the food was just mediocre. It was an exceptionally long wait for food as well, not at a rush time for food might I add. I ordered a burger--hard to get wrong--and it was okay. The predominate flavor in their house sauce on the burger and sandwiches is horse radish. If that's your thing you'll love the place. I prefer a blend of flavor instead of one dominate flavor--but that's just me. All in all, the food was okay, restaurant is a fun location, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"4 of my co-workers and I dined at the Arrogant Butcher for a birthday dinner after a long days work.  We split some appetizers and they were all great.  We had a meat and cheese plate and we ended up getting lucky and having 2 orders come out instead of just 1.  The salami we chose was great... Sliced very thin and the cheese was also great.  I had the bass and it was wonderful!  I was very happy with the portions and way that it was prepared.  2 of my co workers had the filet and they thought it was cooked incredibly well and everything tasted great.  My dad had the fried chicken and he thought he was interesting, but very good.  Just had a different take on Fried Chicken I guess?  We were also pleasantly surprised by the free dessert that we were given because of our co-workers birthday!  It was a great evening and the drinks were a-coming all night long.......  We had a great night.  The bar was crowded and so was the restaurant.  We had a blast!"}
{"text":"Yum yum. My ex and I came here to celebrate our first night of being in Phoenix as we just moved here. The atmosphere gave off a pleasant vibe, and it wasn't too dark or noisy. Mind you, the Tilted Kilt was right next to this place, so I thought it was going to be crazy loud, but I was wrong! Our waiter was really nice, talkative, never had an issue with him or the service. I had the jambalaya which was pretty awesome. My ex got the stuffed crab, which was good as well, though his was a pretty small portion. He shared the rest of my jambalaya, which was huge - I couldn't eat it all myself! The drinks were PERFECT. The beer on tap was awesome and I had 2 cocktails that blew me away. I liked this place a lot and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception for our small wedding of 15 guests.  It was the perfect spot for an intimate occasion.  Everybody loved the food and everybody was full!  The staff were amazing, and Kristy was so helpful with the planning.  I highly recommend this place for the private dining experience."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher is a really good name for this place. We were there on Saturday night. It's a high energy cool spot in a great location but the arrogance of a business to charge this much for so little is spot on. I had the Fra'Mani Salumi 8.00 which was a paper thin small stack of salami and The Montchevre (goat brie) 5.00 which was a small square of cheese. Normally I've always received brie melted but this was just a small chunk. It was served with a large amount of dry french bread and as little as I eat, I was hungry when we left. Another in our party ordered the 36.00 Filet Mignon with creamed spinach and a few sweet potato pieces. This was so small that it looked like a little breakfast steak in a local chain here (I won't mention the name). Needless to say he had one of our snack bars before we left and he still went for food somewhere else. Another of our meals was the Jambalaya which was good and spicy and seemed to have a good portion and quite a bit of shrimp and sausage in it at 18.00. The waiter was nice and quick so I have to say the service was great. But none of us will eat there again."}
{"text":"Love this pace and look forward to dining here whenever I am in Phoenix. How I wish there was an AB in Los Angeles (hello can someone help me with this). Love their charcuterie selection and you can't go wrong with the pretzels and fondue. Tonight' I also tried the wedge salad with Kalbi short rib. To die for!!!! So many flavors, so delicious. Our server Janelle was great. Can't wait to come to Phoenix again....."}
{"text":"Service started out bad.  We likely sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes with no employee saying anything to us.  Once we started to get served drinks though the bartenders were friendly and attentive.    Great happy hour.  Had some lemon cocktail with fresh raspberry puree on top.  So good I drank 3!  Hubby had the antipasto plate and wasn't that thrilled with it.  I had the soft pretzel bites with the cheese fondue.  It was FANTASTIC!  The best soft pretzels and cheese ever.  I can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"Last night we had exceptional service and food. Dining with a toddler isn't always easy, but they made it a wonderful experience!  For apps, we enjoyed the nachos, zucchini fritters and pretzel fondue. Everything was delicious. For dinner, we had fish and chips and the ribs. Both were amazing. But the service was the best! Thank you Brian!"}
{"text":"Food and service on point .. We sat outside , had the crab legs and colossal shrimp for an app. I had the lavender cocktail that was absolutely different, tangy and delicious !  We had the jambalaya and the ribs. Both delicious ! To top it off I had the salted caramel desert that certainly didn't disappoint. Great outdoor seating for people watching :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We just LOVED the  Soft Pretzels & Provolone fondue so much we ordered two orders. We ordered the Montchevre Le Cabrie \"Goat Brie\", super, super, super tiny portion so don't plan on sharing it if you're hungry. We followed appetizers up with a Squash & Pomegranate Salad, turkey pastrami sandwich and the sweet potato tortelli. Trust me when I say that the sweet potato tortelli is UNREAL and you will NOT want to share it. I believe you get 6 of the dumplings with the dish, so again, don't share if you're hungry, lol.  Food is great. Wish the cocktails were bigger for the amount of money they charge for them. Just saying."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The prime rib is some of the best I have ever had. The fish absolutely melts in your mouth. Love the outside seating which is what we usually opt for. The one time we sat inside it was so hot we were sweating and had to ask if they could turn the air down. It is crazy packed on the weekends but that's to be expected. Give yourself enough time to get down there and wait! Service has always been really good. I love bringing people here who have never been! Yummy"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere and a nice list of beers puts this restaurant very near the top of my list in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Another great Fox concept!  So glad he opened something in downtown Phoenix!  I hosted a large group dinner in the back room and we had an amazing experience.  The service was phenomenal - they even took multiple photos of our group on 2 different occasions.    The set menu was fantastic.  I really felt like we got a taste of what the restaurant had to offer.  I highly recommend the beet and apple salad, the crab stuffed chicken and the salted caramel pudding or blueberry cheesecake - absolutely delicious!  I went back a few days later for lunch and wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed the sweet potato tortelli - it was melt in your mouth good!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the atmosphere. Definitively a place to check out!! TAKE A DATE!"}
{"text":"We went there a few weeks ago for dinner on a Friday night.  We live downtown and try to promote the local businesses.  Now granted we did not have a reservation but it wasn't that busy.  We checked in at the hostess counter and she never said \"Give me a couple of min and let me see about a table\" we got nada...  So we stood there for five minutes and then I finally said... should we go to the bar for a drink?  It was like she forgot about us.  It is the little things in customer service that go a long way and I wish some businesses would train their staff on those things.  I swear if I hadn't been wearing heels and already walked 5 blocks to the place I would have found another place to go.  We finally got seated and we both got a glass of wine.  I had the hummus plate and kale salad which both were SO good.  I love it when restaurants have kale, its really underrated!  My bf had the butternut ravioli and it was super good.    The service was good but he seemed to disappear a lot, which was kinda annoying especially when I would have had another glass of wine had he come back to check on our meals.  Wanted to give this place more stars but they definitely need to step it up on the customer service aspect."}
{"text":"The service was great, but like all the other Fox concepts you pay too much for mediocrity. The short rib stew was good. The ribs were cold and the chicken pasta was bland. There are just so many better options in the area... What a disappointment. But I should have known better."}
{"text":"Three of us went here for dinner prior to a show at the Orpheum on a Saturday night. We arrived at 7:30 and did not strictly need reservations but were happy we had them. The atmosphere was good, a bit of a hustle and bustle to the place. The kitchen is open and this is the first place where I have actually heard the kitchen brigade responding with \"Yes  Chef\" a la Hell's Kitchen. We all enjoyed our meals. It was a good experience overall and I will likely go back."}
{"text":"Arrogant Butcher! I got into town pretty late in the evening. I was hungry and need to get something. So I reserved this place. When I got here around 8pm. It was not busy anymore. The place is pretty big, I can say it is huge. They have different part, it feels like the restaurant/bar are different in anywhere you sit! This is wonderful and the place looks cool. The kitchen closes at 10 pm and the bar closes at 11pm!  We got in and greeted with a warm smile by the hostess. We sat at our table and give water straight away. Our server came and asked whether we want to get other drinks? She is really nice and accommodating. Our party came separately and we stayed there for two hours++, she kindly enough order our food separately! The food comes out quite fast and pretty good, I took one star off because of the food! Their main course is simple i mean nothing special. However, their appetizer is amazingggg (their nachos and chicken finger tempura) outta this world! I would comeback there just to get the chicken finger tempura and beer! maybe on a football sunday or like some other sports events!"}
{"text":"Man I really don't remember this place. I'm sure it was great. I know I had the French dip and I vaguely remember loving it! The drinks were great and I do remember that! Had the garlic shrimp basket and that was great as well! Totally worth a trip when in downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"When one decides to venture into the land of the Fox, it's usually because that land is full of win. FRC has an amazing group of restaurants in the valley and The Arrogant Butcher does not let you down either. The Arrogant Butcher is in the centrally located downtown area across from the Usairways Arena but also near other venues downtown, as well. May as well make a night of it if your downtown.  On a whim we came here on a Monday night wanting to test this one FRC out that we had not added to our list. We were not disappointed.  We arrived at TAB about forty minutes before happy hour ended and were quickly waited on and schooled on the cheeses of the day and the drink of the day. Our waitress was on her game!  We started with The Fix: a mixology cocktail of smooth white rum; fresh lemon; and a fresh blackberry compote sat atop this refreshing, light drink . It was 'The Fix' for our happy, alright! For $4 on happy hour! No one can complain about that!  Our appetizer was the Antipasto plate. For $8 on the happy hour menu you get a generous serving of fresh french bread, olives, a dijon mustard, a cheese of the day , (ours was the 'Montchevre; ) and charcuterie meat (ours was a dry 'Framuni' salami). We added another cheese off the cheese board menu, because we consider ourselves serious fromage people! We were torn between more of the Montchevre cheese , which is a aged, smooth goat cheese, with the look and consistency of brie or the Crescenza cheese, which neither of us had ever heard of. Our awesome waitress explained and even suggested we go with the Crescenza since it was a 'new' cheese for our palate. It came out with a cherry compote and more fresh french bread and was an ample supply. Crescenza is a creamy, almost like cream cheese with a stronger flavor and goes perfectly on the bread with a little of the compote schmeared on top. I was full after The Fix and these appetizers, BUT, we had already ordered dinner!  My boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. It was served with Boursin spinach that was sauteed perfectly and a few crispy fingerling potatoes on the side. His filet was a good 1 1/2 inches thick and cooked to perfection. It did seem it was over salted possibly after the cooking process and that could have been lightened up a bit. Simply, it didn't need it! It was perfect without all that salt!  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Chicken. I was stuck between about three different options, despite knowing that I wasn't that hungry! I went with this option because it sounded different. It is a chicken breast that is butterflied and egg dipped into panko crumbs and stuffed with a ton of crab meat! Then served over a bed of sauteed spinach and topped with just enough of lemon and caper au jus. Again, the salt content was a bit overwhelming, but the chicken was cooked to perfection and so tasty that I don't want to knock it for that. Literally, such ample servings on both entrees we not only could have shared, we should have shared!  As if I wasn't full enough! My boyfriend 'reminded' me how much I love peanut butter. Okay. Twist my arm! We split the warm Peanut Butter Cup that is a peanut butter mousse served warm with a scoop of dark chocolate gelato. It melts into your mouth and is more for three people sharing and not just for two!!  My rating: 5 on happy hour 5 on waitress 5 on decor and atmosphere 3 on dinner (only because of salt factor) 5 on dessert Make this a solid 4! or even a 4.5!   I will be sure to trot back to Fox! I always do!"}
{"text":"Good service and environment. Easy to just walk in unless there's an event.  Great:   Scallops pretzel appetizer salmon kale salad  Only thing is it's a bit high on the price side for lunch. I think they could be a bit more competitive. Around $17 for a lunch salad? A tad high. Amazing salad...but still a tad high for lunch."}
{"text":"Ah, after a long day we were looking for great food. And here we are. These guys did it right. Thanks"}
{"text":"I was told by many people that this place was fantastic, a not to be missed experience.  There were four of us dining and we were not impressed.  The food was average, the cost was extravagant.  I would not return."}
{"text":"There are restaurants with good food and then there are restaurants with food which makes your day better and your soul happier..The Arrogant Butcher definitely falls in the second category and no, they haven't paid me to write these  superlatives. Their food gives them the right to be arrogant, and yet, the entire staff is so friendly, nice, and accommodating. I had my first and last meal during my Phoenix trip at this place, and they were both beyond great. I went for dinner on a crowded Thursday night and avoided the wait by agreeing to sit on the high chairs near the chef's corner. I had the best scallop dish in my life that night, scallops and snap peas in a brown butter vinaigrette with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes. Yes, you read that right..bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, what a genius combination, my taste buds definitely thanked me profusely. I also had a bowl of seafood chowder which was very different (in a nice way) and tastier than chowders in general.  It was nice to chat with the chefs and watch them in action as I enjoyed my food. They gave me a few samplers too and even brought me a dessert on the house...wish I could give them an extra star for this! The chocolate cake with chantilly cream is such a delight to your senses, it will make you forget all your sorrows for a while, I promise.  Lunch was equally delightful. I had the best jambalaya in the whole wide world and tempted the guy sitting next to me at the bar to give up on his cheeseburger lunch plans and opt for the jambalaya. It was a very generous portion with bold flavors and such a wonderful spice kick. I also tried the salted caramel pudding with cream, and wasn't disappointed a bit.  Five dishes and all five-star dishes without burning too deep a hole in your pocket, so worth it. Please do visit this place and make your reservations ahead of time if you are in the Phoenix downtown area."}
{"text":"Delicious!  try the filet!  Probably the most tender filet I've had. The charcuterie board was great."}
{"text":"The sweet potato filled tortellini was amazing in a light sauce garnished with cooked spinach and mushroom. Our group was 15 and straggled in but our server was cheerful and efficient.  Getting our salad took awhile but worth the wait.  Everyone at the table raves about the entrees. Favorites were the tortellini, the salmon and the steak.  Dessert was too good to skip. I had the salted caramel pudding and would have licked the bowl."}
{"text":"Jambalaya was so so good! Super spicy, but packed with flavor! Always get the soft pretzels with provolone fondue....it's amazing!  Great dinner!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. First time at the Arrogant Butcher and was not impressed. I feel like it's a trendier version of Chile's. I guess my mistake was ordering the scallops instead of something easier and more mainstream like pasta or a burger. I even asked about the scallops and how they were and waitress assured me they were great. They were nearly inedible and I only ate about half of a very tiny plate. They came with very old, wilted, yellowed parsley on top that I would've thrown away had it been in my fridge. The scallops came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes which were SO SALTY and made the whole dish very unbalanced. It just is the wrong combination for scallops, and was a huge expensive fail. I probably should've sent it back, but I just wanted to get out of there and go home after a long week.   I tasted my husband's fries and they were disgusting! They tasted stale and old, and just plain nasty. Probably the worst fries I've ever tasted. My daughter's mushroom pasta was very nice though, and I dipped my scallops into her leftover cream mushroom sauce so that I didn't leave hungry.  The Laguna Chardonnay was really nice though, and not sure I've had it before. Service was ok in terms of speed, but I didn't encounter anyone particularly friendly. Not rude, just not welcoming.   We were considering having a large company holiday event here, but it's off the list now as I would not trust the food quality."}
{"text":"Service was great, very attentive but the food was very average. Cheese plate and meats were great, but our salad had some wilty greens and the burger was definitely well done when the order was medium rare."}
{"text":"I don't take 5-star lightly.  It is a reflection of Service. Service and of course SERVICE from both the front of the house and the creative genius in the back of the house.  Reserved the boardroom for a special family event. It was set up and ready to go even though we got there early. Pre-ordered a birthday dessert. Perfect timing and presentation with no prompting from me.  Awesome craft cocktails. Good selection of local beers. GREAT menu choices.  I am ashamed to admit how many appetizers we \"tried\" (hey, its all for YOU, my readers!!).  Highly recommend the nachos as a share plate, good flavors, good quantity.  Pretzel fondue YES. White Shrimp Cocktail was over the top tasty and fresh grated horseradish was appreciated!  Fresh sliced crisp jalapenos on the side as requested.   Every entree was well received and perfectly executed (would definitely order all of it again, nothing was \"meh\").    Special shout-out to Celeste who has the patience of a saint and got her \"Steps\" in for the day with my crew.  Her patience was tested and that smile never slipped!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place located in Downtown Phoenix. I really like this place I wish I could afford to eat here more often. The the pretzel soft bread with cheese fondue was great!  I had the BBQ ribs and these have to be one of the best ribs ever! My girlfriend had the jambalaya and it was so good too. Nice place, great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"All the food I had during the visit, which thanks to some sampling of other folks in my parties fair was a good selection of things, was amazing. I had two issues with the offerings, the oysters I got were a bit gritty, and the Old Old Fashioned was similarly grainy on the mouth."}
{"text":"Every time I left a Suns game, while walking towards the valet, I swore that one day I would try dining at the Arrogant Butcher.   Then, I would get distracted by someone wanting to race down Jefferson, after my keys were handed to me, which happened to be the only exciting thing that woke me up out of my stupor from the yawner games.  That was last season. I haven't been back to watch a Suns game since. However, I finally made it to Arrogant Butcher for dinner with my Beloved wife.  This is now, to me, one of the bright spots on Jefferson street, in Downtown Phoenix!  We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and were introduced to the subdued elegance that is the interior of this establishment. The layout is open, inviting, and bustling with a fair amount of patrons.  The hostesses, servers, and bussers were cordial, attentive, polite and efficient.  I had chose the Prime Rib Au Jus with Mashed Potatoes. Although the mashed potatoes weren't particularly spectacular, the slow roasted Prime Rib had a wonderfully succulent texture. Additionally, it was well seasoned and delectable.. Each bite was just scrumptious.  About the only downside of my meal selection was the asparagus. It seemed to have been overdone, then chilled which took away most of the recognizable flavors that is inherent in this particular vegetable.  My wife had the Green Chile Stew. That too was a big hit, and the addition of a fried egg on top made for a particularly appetizing and visually appealing meal. She indicated that it was more Chili, than Stew. But, that did not detract from her overall positive comments and impression of her meal selection.  The Salmon Rillette was also particularly notable as a spread on the wonderfully prepared and grilled bread. Simply savory!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner 3/19/2011 before the symphony.  We had a reservation and, when we arrive at 6pm, the place was already filling up, which I'm glad to see for a downtown location on a Saturday night.  We started with the pick-your-own meat and cheese tray.  With just a few selections, it can get pricey for an appetizer, but it was a reasonable portion of meat and cheese, and presented nicely with preserves and toasted bread.  I started with The Polish Fix cocktail, which basically tasted like lemonade with a kick and crushed raspberries.  Absolutely awesome, went down very easily.    The menu seemed all over the map - casual fare like fish and chips, a few items on a raw bar, sloppy joes, steaks, salmon, pork and beans?  I just could not discern any theme or direction for it all.  Also, we got conflicting information from the servers - the first one telling us the evening's special was short ribs, the second one clarifying it was baby back ribs (not the same thing, at all).    I had the skirt steak, which came on top of an amazing mix of fingerling potatoes and a thick cut bacon, and topped with fresh green beans.  Everything was cooked well, seasoned well, and tasted amazing.    We shared the peanut butter cup dessert, which was weird but worked - a peanut butter creamy base (very thin, not at all like a pudding or mousse, basically the texture of melted ice cream), with a scoop of chocolate gelato and peanut butter cookies on the side.    With a shared appetizer, two entress, one cocktail, 4-5 glasses of wine, and shared dessert, the tab was $180.  A little expensive for a pretty casual dinner, but I would probably go back.    Minor pet peeve - the server had been pretty good about checking in and then went MIA when it was time to get the bill, pay and leave.  This generally drives me nuts, but particularly in the evening downtown, when so many customers are trying to get to a game, concert, etc.  Just let us give you our money and go, ok?"}
{"text":"This place is kickass. I feel like Chili's copied this restaurant with their smokehouse meals. Anyway, it's always been good. Keep up the good work in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Most amazing salmon dish I have ever had! The glaze was amazing, the fish was cooked to perfection and the accompanying medley of pieces of butternut squash, delicate mushrooms, and pieces of Brussel  sprout leafs was unbelievable....I only wish there's been a tiny bit more of it. The huge shrimp ($3.50 each) are also very much worth it!  I have found another great go-to favorite :)"}
{"text":"while serving on jury duty i decided to take in some big city eats. the AB is one of those high falutin places see and be seen all the beautiful people hipsters chicks dudes business peeps you get it . i had the kale and roasted califlower salad with salmon and a  champagne vinigerette though very tasty the amount of salmon was maybe 3oz worth and may have come from a can because it looked a little more like tunafish but again certainly tasted like salmon and was tasty as well. I sat at the bar service was good decor modern yet comfortable."}
{"text":"The server was super nice and helpful. The portions are a bit small, so you might want to order an appetizer. Their food is fusion style, which is pretty neat because the flavor is unexpected. I had their breakfast burrito and it was great! Can't wait to head back there again."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time based on other high reviews but we were disappointed in the slow service. I had the nachos and my husband the green chili stew, the food was good but after waiting an hour to receive it we felt deflated. We were seated at 8:15 pm, took an hour to receive our food and now near 20 mins to pay.  We are finally leaving at 9:55 pm."}
{"text":"I just had a great experience at the Arrogant Butcher. First, the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We started with drinks and an order of the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. The pretzels are freshly made nuggets of perfection -- golden brown saltiness on the outside and tender on the inside. The cheese was the perfect match of savory creaminess. My coworkers ordered the steak, while I opted for the green chile pork stew. The stew is presented in a covered bowl with a side of homeade cornbread. Lift the lid and the beatiful stew, topped with a fried egg is revealed. My only regret is not having enough room for the warm peanut butter cup dessert. I'm only in town for a week, but I'm already planning a return visit."}
{"text":"Our server was so personable and knowledgable about the \"spots\" to go around town. The Chinese Ckn salad was perfect, light, and not too sweet. My husband had the prime rib dip and he loves it! Nice craft beer selection too."}
{"text":"Started off with the pretzels and cheese and fritters. Both were great! Then for the main course I had the turkey sloppy joe which consisted of ground turkey, pablano pepper and pepperjack cheese on a homemade bun... Amazing! And I topped that off with the blueberry cheesecake for dessert (YUM!!!). Overall great food and a very good experience."}
{"text":"PRETZELS ARE THE BOMB!  Fun place with great patio and food!  We always stop there before or after games downtown.  Staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"First & foremost, do NOT drive to & park at Cityscape. It's a royal hosing... They charge for parking like they do in Chicago/NYC! Outrageous! This place is really fun... Good service & great food! The pretzel & cheese appetizer is a MUST! It was by far the best I've ever had. I also recommend the sweet potato tortellini entree! Absolutely delicious. This place isn't cheap, but not super expensive either. Next time I go will be to check out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato Tortelli is AMAZING!!   Dining out as a vegetarian can be tricky if you want something besides a salad. I love that they have a meatless entree, especially one as delicious as this. Kudos to the chef!!  My boyfriend had the Prime Rib (it was a little over cooked) and we shared the Salted Caramel Pudding for desert, it was yummy!!"}
{"text":"A great Happy Hour find!  Their HH promotion run for about $4 (cocktails, appetizers, brews) and runs until 6pm on weeknights.  That being said - let me inform you of what has been missing from your earthly existence.  PRETZELS + FONDUE.  Yes.  Perfect and PLUMP pretzel bits, fluffy on the inside and absolutely sinful when dipped in the cheesy concoction delivered alongside.  Massive (filling for two!) basket + fodue ramekin only $4 during HH!  Dranks: I tried the ($4!) Mexican Maid (Hornitos Blanco, Mint, Cucumber, Lime Sour) as well as the Mule (  Beet salad was   The bill for two people (two beers, two cocktails, two entrees, and an app) came out to be around $70 - - - not too shabby!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find at first, but great setup with lofty atmosphere and diverse crowd. The food is amazing and well priced. My wife and I stopped in for brunch after celebrating our anniversary the night before and we both had a great experience at The Arrogant Butcher"}
{"text":"One of the better places to get a craft cocktail near the stadiums. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  Like all the Fox restaurants - the decor and theme are on point.  The food is above average, but not super memorable.  Its better than most gastropubs and sports bars.  But, if you want an outstanding meal, get away from the arenas."}
{"text":"I had the jambalaya when I was here and it was awesome. It's not necessarily traditional but if the food is great I don't care too much about the technicalities. The layout is great just like any Fox restaurant. Unless you have a reservation, make sure there are no shows or games going on downtown because this place will have  line out the door. Amazing food and service though."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the salmon & kale. It was as substantial as it was delicious. Great lunch place. Plenty of salad options."}
{"text":"Was in AZ for business and went to this restaurant with a colleague. I got the beet salad with chicken and it was great!!! I saw people order the jambalaya so that will be on my list!"}
{"text":"Fun, trendy place to have a drink or meal down town. Cool urban feel location makes for a neat atmosphere that is somewhat unique. I have never eaten here though but would do well definitely be back."}
{"text":"Strolled into this eclectic trendy restaurant on Mother's Day before the Nashville concert. My husband and my daughter were with me and we were seated right away. Our waiter was helpful and cheerful. I noticed the wait staff all had sleeves if tattoos and skinny jeans. They were out of fish and chips so I ended up getting a burger. It is build your own and it was very good! But my favorite was the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, so addicting  had a bacon Bloody Mary to go with and caught a little buzz. It was the mild version but woo, did it have some kick!! The cost was reasonable, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was worth it. We had a great time"}
{"text":"Amazingly good. I splurged for the filet mignon and it was amazing. Not huge (7oz) but incredibly tender and prepared just right. My wife had the fish and chips, and she can never eat all her food so I got to try a bite and it was incredible too. A bit pricey, but the name says it well- arrogant and nothing but the best- you pay for quality."}
{"text":"The service was great and facility is nice, but was definitely expecting more from the food coming from a Fox Restaurant. Prices are pretty steep for the types of items offered, especially given it was off their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Food is bomb but with the price. What gives them 5 stars is the customer service!! Our waiter Micah was super nice and friendly and patient. We went late at night and we had a awkward situation with a stranger and this guy who worked there came out and helped us. He made sure we were okay and safe to get home. THAT is what I call costumer service! I never got his name but he wore a striped button up and he had dark hair and a beard. He was tall and on the fluffier side. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concept never misses the mark with any of their establishments, and Arrogant Butcher is no exception. Awesome spot to get food and drinks in downtown, especially before an event, with a great menu (NACHOS!) and very modern setting. A bit pricey IMO, so prepare to spend a bit, but a hot destination nevertheless."}
{"text":"Barbarically elegant dining with quality meat ;-)  I Much enticed by its name, I long to figure out how far stretched my taste can be at this place with the bloodiest name in dining arena. To my surprise, this is a setting for some reasonably priced fine dining. If weather is nice, you should sit at the patio, which is outdoor street level dining area.   Debating between New York Strip or Fillet Mignon, I follow the recommendation and go with the former. The Strips are tender in texture, rich in flavor, dripping in juice. [Certified Angus Beef, Succotash, Creamy Horseradish] It has plenty of meat:)  My newly made friend picked New Zealand Sea Bass, which is prepared with [Artichoke, Creamy Barley, Crushed Chile and Lemon]. It's kind of him letting me have a bite. Hmm, the soft white protein separated in my tenderest chew.  The view. Sitting at the street corner, we enjoyed the ambient sunset moments while watching people and cars passing by in no rush.   On a Monday night, it was an enjoyment."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this place, they were out of their designated specials, didn't offer to anything to make up for their mistake & over cooked the food they did have, just overall poor service and experience. If your visiting Phoenix downtown go somewhere else plenty of restaurants in this area this was a major let down."}
{"text":"What I Ate - House soft pretzels and provolone fondue - Sweet potato tortelli - Grilled asparagus  Would I Go Again? The word I would use to describe this restaurant's food is \"bold.\"  The sweet potato tortelli was fantastic--very strong sweet and salty flavors.  The portion was kind of small, for which I was grateful.  The flavors were so \"bold\" that I don't think I could've eaten any more.  The grilled asparagus were great--again, very \"bold\" flavor with olive oil and vinegar.  Lastly, the soft pretzel bites and provolone fondue were outstanding!  If only my soft pretzel at ballgames tasted like these pretzel bites and the cheese dip like this provolone fondue!  The Arrogant Butcher was great, and I would like to come back next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and a great staff makes this a downtown Phoenix no-brainer.  FOOD: Delicious.  Have had their salad and a few of their sandwiches.  They charcuterie board is a real deal.  ATMOSPHERE: Neat, comfortable place with outdoor seating.  SERVICE: Attentive, quick, helpful, warm.  They accidentally spilled some dressing on my coat and comped my entree.  Great service.  PRICE: Reasonable, especially compared to some pricier cities in the US."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on a busy Friday night. I got there a few minutes before my reservation, but my table was not ready, and waited for 40 mins.  I was initially very upset, because I made a reservation expecting to be seated at my desired time. The manager noticed and acknowledged my frustrations, and even the server that was going to take care of us came to apologize. Definitely WOWed by this gesture. When we were seated the manager made sure to cover our appetizers. My experience was turned around.   The food was very good. Most of the dishes are flavorful and hearty.  I personally got the Jambalaya rice, which was very tasty but very spicy. Make sure you pair it with the corn bread   Recommendations:  1. Butcher's Board - they even make sure to explain to you all the items  2. Nachos w/ Carnitas - very flavorful  3. Burger w/ Bacon"}
{"text":"Meh... another Fox restaurant.  The wait staff was remarkable...perfect service."}
{"text":"Delectable, salad and pastrami were mouth watering-ly satisfying. Quick seating and proper attention. Food was standout good for a deli selection.   Friend ordered turkey sloppy joe and coleslaw and said it was good, however was unsatisfied with the amount of coleslaw provided."}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you're downtown for whatever reason. Nice enough to bring clients to. Good sized portions and thoughtfully crafted menu. Appetizers are a plus such as the pretzels."}
{"text":"Would have given four stars but decided to only give three due to service. A few co-workers and I went for lunch. Service was ok during our meal. She brought the check right away and we paid right away. We ended up staying about 20-25 min after paying the bill talking. There was no one waited to be seated. Our server disappeared and we never saw her again. We were never offered refills on our drinks or checked in on. It was disappointing. We've done the same at other places and even culinary drop out and received much better service. Also wasn't overly impressed with the lunch menu options. Prefer culinary drop out for lunch now."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Scallops and fish tacos were great.....our server was awesome.  She was very knowledgeable...but service was very, very slow.  It took six of us two hours and fifteen minutes to eat.  It took us an hour and a half to get our food.  Not ideal."}
{"text":"The sandwiches okay, the fries mediocre, but the pretzel fondue was out of this world! I still dream about it."}
{"text":"Two main things to note - the portions are small and the prices are $$$.  We've been three times and there are some things that we really like, but I hate spending this much money and leaving hungry.  Their fried squash blossoms (zucchini fritters?) are fantastic.  Their salads are excellent, but the portion size is between a standard dinner salad and an entree salad at most places -- plus having protein added is an upsell (and they don't list the price).  My wife loves their grilled salmon (she's ordered it twice), but the portion size isn't enough for her, which is funny because she is always the one that brings half of her dinner home.  Final note - the salted caramel pudding is fantastic."}
{"text":"3 stars in Yelp terms means \"A-OK.\" I went round & round about this but 3 was warranted since upon my latest visit (last night), everything was simply OK. Here is the issue I have with Fox restaurants & have a few examples to back it up: they are inconsistent on all levels. When I go to a restaurant & have an amazing meal, amazing service, & leave feeling full, I expect that same experience the next time, the time after that, & so on. I recognize that the kitchen can have an off night occasionally, but that should not affect everything ordered, portion size, or service for that matter. Here is an example: About a month ago, the hub & I went to AB for lunch. We went in with low hopes since we had a less than delightful meal at Fox's sister restaurant, Culinary Dropout (see scathing review). We were pleasantly surprised with AB. The hub ordered the Saturday special, prime rib with horseradish scalloped potatoes, AMAZING! The portion size was large, the prime rib cooked & seasoned well, but the star was the potatoes which were phenomenal! I was shocked when out of the goodness of his heart (he usually doesn't have a lot of goodness in there), the hubby decided to let me try them. I wish I hadn't now because it is setting in that I will never have those delicious, creamy potatoes again   :( Anyways, I ordered the ribs, which were fall off the bone & were pretty much the epitomy of perfection when it comes to ribs. The fries it came with were pretty decent (I am picky about fries & I ate all of these) & the mayo based, non sweet slaw was a good accompaniment to the sweetly sauced ribs. We also ordered hummas before our meal & I can honestly say that it was the best hummas & flatbread I have ever had! Silky, creamy, salty, sweet, you get it all from this hummas thanks to it being made fresh (along with the pita bread I have reason to believe) & due to the sprinkling of calamata olives & sweet peppers. We literally licked the bowl, that is how good it was. Only complaint is that a couple more pieces of flatbread would have made the flatbread to hummas ratio more equal. So all in all, a delicious, satisfying meal with service on point. Only other complaints were the mixed drinks were puny & the parking can be a bit stressful if you don't venture into downtown Phx much. We are country folk & had no idea which parking garage to go into, it crept up on us several times too late, so around the block we went again & again (one way road systems suck) until we got it right. But that is the case for all downtown Phx businesses so no biggie.  Cut to last night: We decided to divert from the usual Firebirds anniversary dinner & go to AB instead & catch live music next door. Our server was really slow this time, so much that we started to wonder if we even had a server to begin with. When we finally got to talk to her, we ordered the hummas (which was divine yet again, the only consistant thing), hub ordered prime rib special again with those mouthwatering potatoes, & I ordered the sweet potato tortelli which I had seen so many great reviews on. I also tried to get a side of the scalloped potatoes but was told they couldn't do that since they only make enough to go with the prime rib. In my opinion, kinda dumb. If they are that popular, you should be able to order a side of them on the one night they are available, AB just needed to make more. However, in the end, I was actually fine with not getting them because they were not the same as before. They didn't look as good & per the hubby, they were kinda dry with no horseradish flavor. On top of that, his primerib was overly salted (he loves the edge pieces where the seasoning is and they were way too salty, I tried some non edge pieces & felt those were even too salty). It was also undercooked in the middle. It appeared raw & literally jiggled when you poked it. The creamy horseradish we requested was not mixed up enough so the top just tasted like mayo while the bottom of the cup was all radish. My tortelli tasted ok but was not even close to being a full meal. There were 6 small tortellini in a butter sauce with some spinach leaves and a few nuts. This was closer to appetizer size. Needless to say, I finished my dinner in about 5 minutes & had to have a few pieces of the hubbys prime rib to be somewhat satisfied.  I hate to do this but I am going to be particularly hard on Sam Fox. With the price points of these restaurants, I expect a good experience every time. Unfortunately, that has not happened. This same situation happened with Blanco, first time great, 2nd time decent, third time, not impressed at all. Who knows, maybe if I go to Culinary DO again, it will be spectacular. However, I know not to expect that repeatedly. I just don't understand... places like Firebirds & Charlestons have it down pat. I get a great meal at these places every time but with Fox restaurants, I am lucky to get a good meal twice. Only reason to return would be gift card/ someone else paying."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, very good environment. Can't except more. 5 stars of course. I'm Chinese. Believe me I know what's delicious food. The scallop is perfect. Short rib and salmon are delicious too. This time random choice leads to good result. I'm really happy. My father likes the dishes very much too."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hyatt a few blocks away and people raved about this place so figured I'd try it for dinner. Started with the cheese fondue appetizer which was pretty solid. Ordered fish and chips and was disappointed with it. The fish was kind of burnt, not sure how that happens. Ended with the blueberry cheesecake dessert which was really good. Server was really friendly. All in all, an okay place. Don't see the hype behind it."}
{"text":"First timer.. The sandwich selection is superb for lunch. I personally had the pastrami and turkey sandwich with coleslaw in it... I'm not much of a coleslaw kind of guy, but that sandwich was defiantly up on the list for greatness. Thank you, we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Where the heck is the darned restaurant???  Why not have a courtyard entrance to get to this place.  With all the construction going on, only a couple of cars almost clipped us.  We were greeted by a nice host.  Nice, friendly and good vibe inside.  We were seated after only a 10 minute wait.  I was liking this place already.   The fresh baked pretzels with fontina fondue was so good.  If gluten overloae gives you the bloat, then pass on this one.  My hubby and cutie pie decided to share the fish and chips, they obviously liked a lot.   After seeing the green chile pork stew on the cover of Phoenix magazine, I had to try it.  Topped with fried egg.  How can it fail?  Aaahh...after eating, I want to take a nap on the comfy booth.  I can't wait to go back to try other items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"this place is the best place ever. its pricey but its worth every single dollar. best filet in town and strong cocktails"}
{"text":"Their ribs are delicious! And all of their food is fresh (except for the frozen peas, which are listed as \"frozen peas\" on the menu). Great atmosphere and music, but not so loud that you can't enjoy good conversation. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & great service! Fun to go to before a concert downtown!"}
{"text":"First time and was i impressed. Not only was the food amazing but the staff ( tiffaney and crew)really made it a great experiance."}
{"text":"Recommended by our hotel concierge, we were not disappointed. Our crispy shrimp appetizer was perfectly cooked and not greasy. My scallop entree was fantastic-cooked perfectly, creamed corn was really light. But I cannot explain how delicious the warm peanut butter mousse with chocolate gelato dessert was. That was probably one of the best desserts I've had in a restaurant (and I've had more than my share of desserts)  Service was friendly and helpful. Atmosphere is modern -open and airy.   If visiting the Phoenix area, it's definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Only been here once for a birthday lunch but tried a decent amount.   There is only one important thing you must know. Best BLT EVER. I have had my fair share in my day and this one will always stand out as best. Tomato jam paired with the smokiest bacon I've ever had? Genius.   Cuban sandwich was also ridiculously delicious but it was hard to follow up the amazing BLT."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughters birthday and had looked at the menu online ahead of time. Unfortunately, there was a baseball game and we were informed that they reduce the menu on game days and eliminate any sandwiches, burgers, etc. We asked for an exception to accommodate my son's food allergies (plain hamburger) and they accommodated him. Food was great, service was exceptional -recommended!"}
{"text":"This is such a unique place to go and unwind.  They do an excellent job of service and their food is amazing.  They really put their best foot forward when it comes to customer service.  Thanks for the great night out!"}
{"text":"Not worth wait or hype. Ran out of the sea bass, the scallops had gone bad (um yea) and had to wait 40 min for food. I wouldn't go here again if I am in the Phoenix area again."}
{"text":"Very busy , noisy and crowded. I thought the menu was odd and not consistent offering. Entertained a client at this restaurant which was a mistake. Food was just ok and nothing special. To many options in Phoenix to consider."}
{"text":"I had two meals here, in December 2011 and in April 2012. The decor and concept are cool. The menu reads with the promise of a great meal. When your food arrives, it looks good and is well-plated. Then you take a bite. And think, with almost a mental shrug, well, it's pretty good. The edge of disappointment. I don't remember but one thing I ate from either meal. But what I do remember is the gold lining, a delicious dessert version of a peanut butter cup. Warm golden peanut butter pudding of sorts with chocolate sauce. It is an eyes rolling back in your head kind of dessert. Coffee and dessert after a show would be a great option for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was below average. I had the crab stuffed chicken. The chicken was flattened (think Smashburger style) then breaded and pan fried. More breading than meat. As far as \"stuffed\" crab, it was a piece of crab patty laid between the two smashed pieces of chicken. How does that qualify as crab stuff chicken? Also lacked flavor. Presentation on the plate was excellent. Was better to tweet than eat.  If you want a place to be seen, sure, this works. If you want a place to eat, might want to skip it."}
{"text":"Stayed the weekend in Pheonix and went twice. The beef short rib stew w/ cornbread is the best meal I've had in a long time. Incredible flavor. The chef deserves the Nobel prize for the corn bread. Also tried the pretzel bites w/ cheese dip which were delicious as well, but the stew cannot be beat."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because afterwards we were going to Stand Up Live comedy event a few blocks away.  We are so happy we did...  None of the people in our group had ever eating or drank here prior. When we arrived the place was jumping for a Thursday night.  We were immediately greeted and seated.  All the employees were friendly and smiling. You can sit outside on thier patio which offers cool downtown views and movement of the city.  We chose to sit inside the resturant.  This is a very nice, clean, modern atmosphere with a open kitchen concept.  On to the food.... They nailed all four of our meals.  My wife and I both had the crab stuffed  chicken breast, with spinach and lemon butter caper sauce.  Yum yum!  My brother had a 4 piece hand batterd fried chicken meal they offer every Thursday as a special.  Comes with a honey butter biscuit and a side coleslaw.  Wow was that amazing too...  For dessert I reccomend trying thier chocolate cake in a cup! From start to finish this place rocked.  We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had the tabbouleh chicken salad.  It was good. It had nice balance and was dressed well. Either the dressing or the chicken was a bit salty (couldn't get ring off afterwards) but it tasted good.  Are on the patio which was really nice.  Would return."}
{"text":"I had the Zucchini  and I must say they were yummy. For the Main course I'm having the Short Rib Beef Stew. It also was AMAZING! this place is trendy with a full bar with lots of beer and wine to choose from. Tue night had no shortage of people and my service was GREAT!  Thanks for the awesome dining experience."}
{"text":"The scallops were awesome! Service was a little slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent ~  I created my own ~ cheese~ garlic~ roasted peppers~ almonds~ crusty prosciutto deviled eggs w White corn tortilla chips instead of crusty bread because of my gluten allergy. Husband had the seafood stew... Everything was excellent. The lighting. The server Syndey ~the music. I never leave reviews. This spot is well worth givin a shout out!"}
{"text":"We went here before the symphony. First time visit. Really enjoyed it. The chef's platter was great! The detail the kitchen put into each item was amazing! We love trying different things, and that's what you'll get here!"}
{"text":"Service 10/10 Generosity 10/10 Selection 10/10 Quality 10/10  You had me at double meat burger. I almost had to hold the bread, but am happy I didn't because it was warm and perfectly slathered with homemade mayonaisse and as requested, a little bit of butter and blue cheese ... The king crab ciopino is the die for ... I am just so grateful I can enjoy all that shellfish without having to go to war to get at the meat ... bread sopping yumminess!!! And the cubano ... oh Mr Arrogant Butcher ... don't ever be humble !"}
{"text":"Reliably delicious Fox restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Similar to Culinary Dropout. Friendly waitstaff. Energetic atmosphere (but not to the point of obnoxious...it's a pleasant energy).  Always my go-to spot for grub when I'm in that part of town."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to try the food, but the happy hour wine specials were great.   Service was as nice as the weather!"}
{"text":"Already a huge fan of Culinary Dropout and other Fox restaurants, I was super-excited to try this place. We had reservations, so there was no wait. The place has a very cool ambiance - nice, but casual. Everything we ordered was pretty amazing. To start, we split the roasted beet salad. Delish. My date had the Halibut and I had the Salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and I would have licked my plate, had it been appropriate. We were done with our meal, enjoying some wine (good selection, by the way) and had some time to kill before the event we were going to was starting. Even though there was now a wait at the door, our server (who was awesome) made NO attempt to rush us out. Excellent experience, great food, great service. Can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"Great, fun atomosphere! Service was great! My wife and I had a wonderful date night here.  The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good.  Average prices but great value! Highly recommend this place for date night!"}
{"text":"Overpriced menu, marginal service- not that busy, fish tacos were awesome a year ago, this time, burned and tough- microwaved too long?  Two fish tacos, two glasses of wine, an appetizer salad, almost $50! I will gladly pay that for good food and service, but lacking both, it's a stretch!"}
{"text":"Our service was excellent!   Had the After School Special cocktail, which was limey and tasted like summer. Had the pretzels and provolone fondue for an appetizer and it was SO GOOD. Also got the scallops for the entree, they were fresh and good for light dinner, the corn/cheese mash that they were sitting on was a little salty/strong for the delicate taste of scallops. And the dessert was really good - warm peanut butter cup, basically a peanut butter sauce with a scoop of gelato served with 2 peanut butter cookies.   Overall my husband and I weren't blown away by the entrees, but I think the apps, charcuterie, cocktails, and dessert are worth going back for."}
{"text":"I don't know how you talk yourself into eating stew when it is 110 outside...but, do it.  Beef rib is amazing and totally worth it.  As a southerner, I love that it comes with cornbread on the side and the cornbread exceeds stringent expectations.  Just love this place.  You won't be sorry, it's all good...but that short rib is something special...even at 110 degrees."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, the service is decent.  I would come back, but would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside and get your meat and cheese fix. Is it the best? No, but it'll definitely do the trick. I came here for lunch and it was fairly busy but I still got great service. I'd stop by again to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Went there again for lunch and had a much better experience. I would just say don't get the burger. Everything else works :)"}
{"text":"The service, ambiance, and food were all spot on. I went here with my boyfriend last night and had a wonderful experience. Whenever either one of us had an empty drink it was almost immediately offered a refill by another employee, regardless of if they were our server or not. Everyone working there genuinely wanted all customers to have a good experience even if they weren't getting tipped for their service. The pretzel rolls with provolone fondue were AMAZING! But super easy to fill up on (so hold off on eating too many). I had the king crab cioppino which was great and my boyfriend had the diver scallops. I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the scallops are seared brown on the tops of them on the diver scallop plate, which I don't personally care for, but everything else was great. I will be back again to try more of what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork carnitas.  The dish came out barely warm and the pork was very dry.  Overall the dish lacked flavor and was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I dined at The Arrogant Butcher last night while a Suns game was in progress. The place was packed on a Saturday night and you could definitely feel the vibrancy and energy throughout the restaurant. I was with a group of about 10 people and we had a great time conversing, our service was spot on and water glasses continuously filled.  I loved the round dunkin donut sized pretzel nuggets as an appetizer. I ordered the Swordfish ($23) for my entree. The fish filet was about the size of my fist, so I'm thinking it was about 6 ounces. It was accompanied by artichokes, creamery barley, crushed chile and lemon. The Swordfish was just ok for me, I have had better. Oh how I miss Crab & Things.  I will return to sample some other items on the menu. I'm guessing Swordfish is not their specialty."}
{"text":"Excellent service at the bar.  Food is dialed in.  The Crispy shrimp and peppers appetizer comes with a mildly spicy aoli. This is my favorite thing on the menu.  The grilled salmon entree is very good, but it is not the biggest dish so don't just get that if you have a big appetite. I don't have a big appetite so it's a go to for me.  The fish tacos are also very good."}
{"text":"We came in extra early for dinner on the way to an event. The place was packed and on a wait with mostly sports enthusiast also on the way to an event. That normally is a good sign that things should be running well. I did notice the hostess using great restraint not filling every single table to pace the kitchen. Eventually we got seated, my husband ordered a drink off the drink menu, I thought they might run too sweet so I ordered what I thought was a common drink that you can get anywhere a bloody mary. The waiter comes back very apologetic and tells me they don't have the ingredients to make a bloody mary and hands me the drink menu so real fast I picked skinny mojito not realizing it was raspberry flavored because I picked it out too fast and didn't read it all. He brings it over and the color is bubblegum pink. So I tried it and there was no way anyone anywhere can drink this drink, it really was that bad the chemical taste was overwhelming. IT WAS THE WORST DRINK I EVER TASTED ANYWHERE and I wasn't even able to chug it for a buzz. I do note my husbands drink was drinkable but left an after taste in my mouth and he also couldn't believe how horrible the raspberry mojito was.  We decided to share and start with two cheeses that come with two chunks of bread each and a tiny pot of rasp berried cherries. This was the highlight of the meal and I am not a fan of rasp berried cherries. However the cheeses and bread was fresh cut to order and that is how it should be done.  When we finished my waiter did notice I pushed away the drink and asked me if I wanted to try another drink. I said no, I will just drink water and he took it away. (and off the bill)  I decided to try the salmon and envisioned it tasting good with apples and farro. But what I received was less than a dieters portion as a whole, the fish had a nice sear on it but wasn't as fresh as I like and was a little over cooked but edible. A very small amount of spinach and fennel garnished the fish that was approximately a tablespoon total. I could tell just by looking at the farro it wasn't cooked. I was brave and decided to try the farro and it was undercooked being very chewy and also was what I am thinking might have been end of the pan because it also was HARD AND CRUNCHY and I could have damaged my teeth eating it. I also wasn't a fan of the flavors because this entree was as sweet as dessert. Little tiny light like small water chestnut shape things were elevating the salmon and they was odd, honestly I thought they were water chestnuts but they turned out to be the apples that I forgot about. I doubt that this dish is suppose to be this was and do chalk it up to them being massively busy and running out of food. But this dish WAS A TRAIN WRECK and I was steaming over the crunchy farro that was HARD to chew.  My husband had the jambalaya, he said the chicken in it was very dry and he thought all the ingredients were cooked separately and then just tossed together.  We were checked on when we were finished at that point I really didn't feel like bringing up the farro after that traumatizing pink drink.  My husband meant well and was sorry he picked this place for dinner."}
{"text":"7/29/17 Had reservations for 6:45 and our table was ready on time...off to a good start. This was my first time here, as it is one of my co-workers favorite restaurants. The bathroom was clean and I love the soap that they have...smells very good. I ordered the soup of the day which was corn chowder....flavorful, but I prefer my chowder to have a thicker consistency.  My chowder was supposed to come out first, but my food ended up coming out first. I ordered crab stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes on the side. When my food arrived, I asked them where my soup was. They apologized and brought it out.  A few minutes later the manager came over and apologized and said dessert would be on them. I thought that was amazing customer service and I greatly appreciated the gesture. The crab stuffed chicken was good, not delicious and mashed potatoes were just ok. I ordered the \"hot\" chocolate cake and that definitely was the star of the night. Would I give this place a 2nd try, yes."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar, had two glasses of wine and ordered the filet mignon. While the food and drinks were mediocre, the service was extremely slow. I left content until I checked my credit card a few days later. I left a $13 tip on a $75 bill. I had written evidence of this on my receipt. But I was charged an extra $2 on my credit card. I have decided not to call the restaurant to deal with this because I expect this happens often enough. Instead, I would like to warn others to check your credit card statements if you decide to eat here. Or, avoid this place altogether, especially if you are attending a conference in the area. There person who served me was a young woman who worked behind the bar. I hope someone does something about this."}
{"text":"I went here for a recent business meeting with colleagues.  We picked it because of its central location and decent Yelp reviews.  It had okay food and service, and the atmosphere was pretty nice for a relaxed business meeting. Elements of our experience, however, were very strange.    We stared with cocktails & oysters, which were great.  When it came time for entrees, things got weird.  The waitress kept telling us the dishes we were considering when ordering were \"mediocre\", or \"not the best I've had\", or \"only okay\".    Our meals- the salmon, the scallops, and a kale salad with chicken- turned out okay, but the overall experience left something to be desired. I don't think I'll go back, especially considering the large number of great restaurants from which to choose in the area!"}
{"text":"A little bit fancy for our quick food fix with two small children on a special event weekend with what seemed to be a temporary extra special fancy dinner menu. However, after hearing some of the other less elegant options, I settled on the meatball sandwich. It was absolutely delicious and I devoured it! Very elegant atmosphere"}
{"text":"Fox restaurants typically are delicious, but people like myself and other Yelpers are weary of chain restaurants and although this is the only arrogant butcher and not a chain like Sauce or True Food its easy to lump it together into a \"chain restaurant motif\" being a Fox restaurant.  Fact of the matter is that's not fair, this unlike a quick in and out concept like Sauce, its a sit down restaurant that turns out to be excellent.   I've read reviews where people were disappointed with the quality, I think those people just drove out of there way maybe living in the west valley or something and amp'ed it up too highly, kinda like when you see a movie and it sucks then its better the next time.  Either way I've been here 3 times and every time had a delicious meal every time.  One thing that's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an \"antipasto\" menu that looks like a sushi bar menu (single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil) full of various cheeses, meats and extras (grilled asparagus, olives, elephant garlic, $1 mussels, etc.) this allows you to get your appetizers going right away.  Whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that's honestly to die for, so delicious!  I could go for the antipasto menu alone.  To eat I've tried the turkey sloppy joe, which sounds dumb, in defense of the sandwich first off it was lunch and it came with a grilled poblano chili on top, it was amazing.  I've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini (excellent) and my favorite thing so far which I will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg, cornbread.  The flavor with the egg is mindbogglingly awesome and the cornbread is fresh, moist and delicious.  I've never had a bad meal and/or experience here, after here (as far as other bars @ citiscape) is a different story because I have an alcohol problem :)"}
{"text":"Bar area is really crowded given the location next to the stadium, food was good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is totally cool. If you're looking for an awesome place to eat in Phoenix, this is it. We were there over the holiday weekend and it seemed like everything was closed, but this place was hopping. The service was excellent. We highly recommend the pretzel appetizer, and the Turkey Sloppy Joe."}
{"text":"So good! Their butchers board is fantastic! Loved the scallops and the peanut butter foam for desert was out of this world. I love it!! And the atmosphere is so great!"}
{"text":"We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.    All in all, a really nice meal!"}
{"text":"This was a great stop during my trip to Phoenix. We went on a Friday night, reservations at 6:30. We showed up a little early, had a drink and were seated pretty close to our res time. Great atmosphere, loved the look of the place.   We didn't try any of the appetizers but our food was excellent. I had the grilled salmon, husband had the sea bass. Both very well worth it. Portions could've been a tad bigger, but we walked out feeling pleasantly (not overly) full.  I will say I was a tiny bit disappointed in the [lack of] menu options. I wasn't looking for pages and pages of options, but I was looking for a little bit more of a variety with a name like \"The Arrogant Butcher\".   For dessert we also had the warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato. My husband absolutely loved it, but it was a bit too much peanut butter for me."}
{"text":"Everything I tried here is amazing!! Whenever someone's here from out of place this is the place I take them. It's right downtown Phoenix next to the stadiums. The location is awesome! This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff, attractive dining room, interesting menu, quality food at moderate price, and perfectly located for downtown PHX events. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to join friends for dinner. I would definitely recommend it if you are going to go down town."}
{"text":"I was here on business and was staying downtown. Decided I'd try to go here if even just for a seat at the bar. When I got here they were busy and told me I'd have to wait for a spot outside, no problem I thought, I'll grab a glass of wine at the bar. The hostess never came back to me to seat me outside. Oh well, the bartender was kind enough to let me sample a few of the wines by the glass, their offering is fairly one dimensional but I found one that worked well. The food was fantastic though. Will try it again."}
{"text":"Always so much fun to grab a bite to eat here before heading to date night at the Symphony. This may sound extravagent, but its so worth it. Invest in your marriage with great food and fun date nights!"}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour! Meatball board & bottle of wine! Yummy,  comes on top of pelenta & Italian bread toasted lightly,so good! Also the sausage board! Oh so good! Lots of fun!  The bartendersare great! The Italiano drink is awesome!! Yummy! Gets busy by 6! We got there at 4! So we got the bar seats!"}
{"text":"I met some friends here to celebrate a birthday and I was very impressed! Our waiter was great and very attentive. We were a somewhat complicated table, splitting bills and being on a time-crunch, but he handled everything with grace.  We ordered the pretzel bites to start, which are DANGEROUS! I could eat a whole basket by myself.  The food was delicious and they have a great selection of wines. I ordered the Prime Rib, which you can only get on Saturdays. It was truly cooked to perfection! I also tried the scallops and the filet, both of which melt in your mouth.  Overall, the Butcher is a cool spot right in the heart of downtown. It's worth a try!  PRO TIP: The hostesses won't seat you until your whole group has arrived and they don't accept reservations. If you're meeting a group or headed over to a sporting event or concert across the street, make sure to give yourself ample time!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Kimpton hotel near, we tried the Butcher. The food was very good and the service outstanding. The prices were a bit over the top is the only reason for not giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"What do you do when you only have one evening, basically enough time for dinner and drinks in Phoenix before taking off for an early morning flight? You make the best of your first time in town and scroll through Yelp to help you find good food and drinks!  Hubby and I are notorious \"small plates/tapas kind-a-people\" so when I came across this place I could tell from looking at the pictures, this place would be right up our alley. The place is huge so take your pick! We chose to belly up to the bar and start the night off with a few cocktails. And, seriously, what's more fun than getting served by a Jake Gyllenhaal's doppelganger?? Okay, I'll admit it was more fun for me, than for hubby, but he couldn't deny this guy was his identical twin separated at birth.   We decided on ordering a charcuterie board (aka Butcher's platter $24) because that's our jam. It was the chef's daily favorites and while it was different, it was good minus the blue cheese.We enjoyed the spin on it with the deviled eggs, corn cake muffins, pistachios, and bacon wrapped sweet potato bites.   The cocktails we had were all very good. Prices ranged from $11-12 bucks which is about average for hand crafted drinks. They also have a variety of beers on tap as well as bottle/canned beer too.  The rest of the menu looked appetizing as well with dishes ranging from meatloaf, salads, stews, fish, burgers and a raw bar too!   Overall, who wouldn't like sitting in a hipster bar being served cocktails and appetizers by Jake Gyllenhaal? Ok, well don't ask my husband, but take it from me, I'd definitely go back if in Phoenix again and well, of course try more of their dishes and (probably) sit in the dining area! No, just kidding of course at the bar!"}
{"text":"Good not great. Nice salad but nothing spectacular.  Had a couple cheeses as well that were the same.  Good not great"}
{"text":"Not a fan of atmosphere. I understand the hipster vibe, but the establishment should worry about the food quality more than the appearance. I would give it 1 star, but the food was okay...although it should be for the price."}
{"text":"Ambiance: awesome! Really cool large lamps that made the restaurant look so big!   Appetizer: the pretzels and fondue are a must!! To die for. But be prepared to eat more than you plan to. They are addictive and will fill you up big time!!  Drinks were fantastic. Wine was wonderful nobly problem was that boyfriend wanted to try a unique beer there and they were out. We went there so he could try a couple he has never had. So that was unfortunate.   To eat we got the fish and chips- delicious!! And the pork carnitas were so good. Amazing. The combination of flavors was so good.   The service was super fast! We got the meals so quickly! And out server was great wit recommendations.   Overall, besides the beer being out, we had a great dinner date. Would definitely go back. I highly recommend the pretzels!! Yum!"}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher happy hour actually makes me happy! :-D"}
{"text":"Really good so I came twice in two days haha  The beef rib chew  The king crab  The steak salad   And the reselling   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 or 4 times, and will def go back again. I really wish they could up their service a  notch.It is the only that drags it down to a 3-4 star experience. It really bothers me when the servers come with an attitude. Just tone it down a bit, be a bit more friendly and seriously it would be good for business. Heck I might even tip more.  =)   I cant complain about the food, every time we have been here the food has been delightful. Just the kind that makes you want to really go back again and again and again.   Also the bar tender doesnt know to not drown your single malt with ice, so make sure you specify !"}
{"text":"Great place for downtown. Interior was open and interesting. The menu left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious but the menu was limited. I ordered the scallops with sweet potato wrapped in bacon. It was so tasty but there was no side dish. For the price of this dish there should have been a ton of the snap peas on this plate. For desert I ordered the salted caramel which was so good but it was runny inside. Next time we will come in just for wine and the meat/cheese platters that they offer. You can choose your cheeses and different meats to accompany your wine and nosh."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for my birthday today and I do not have one single complaint. Everything was incredible. The two waiters were absolutely kind and timely with all our requests. They recognized my birthday and brought out my desert with a candle. We ordered a salmon salad, salmon entree, and chicken entree which were all top of the line good, and I have been to extremely good restaurants and this has definitely topped them. The food was fresh, perfectly seasoned and the service was more than kind."}
{"text":"Cool place....  great wins selection, I ordered a newyork steak and it tasted great. It was a bit under cooked but seasoning was just right."}
{"text":"Really good steak and nice server!"}
{"text":"Very cool spot to grab some food. We came here on a weekday for lunch and there was a 20 minute wait. We are not from the area so maybe that is normal in these parts.   For food we started out with oysters which where prefect. We ordered the chefs creation Butchers plate. It was over priced but still really good.   Jambalaya was spot on. Spicy, very flavorfully and piping hot. I tried a salad with steak and that too was delicious.   Our assigned server was not the greatest but whatever. It happens.  Parking was a nightmare. So, do what I later found out you can do instead...park in the parking garage next to the restaurant and you will get a ticket from the restaurant to give the parking attendant so that you do not have to pay $10 for parking. You will need the money; this place ain't cheap.   Overall, you should try this place out."}
{"text":"Cool Vibe. Good food. The cooks Messed up my Crab stuffed chicken, BUT the waitress made it right! Shout out to Sydney! The IPA was Gooooooooood. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had the house pretzel as an app, the ab cheese burger and salted caramel pudding. It was all fantastic and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I came out here to visit my boyfriend and we got the Butcher's Platter to share; it was absolutely fantastic! Loved the balsamic-drizzled bread, the prosciutto and salami that were on it that day, the spicy mustard, and bacon-wrapped sweet potatoes. The salmon salad was also really good, and it was the perfect amount for sharing between the two of us. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I ordered a simple chopped salad for dinner Wednesday evening at around 7:00 PM.  The dish was delicious and the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"came here for lunch after climbing camelback mountain. needed to treat myself after doing that! had the crispy shrimp for an appetizer.  the shrimp were large and fried perfectly. the dish came with fried jalapenos as well which was a nice pairing with the shrimp, but i think maybe fresh slices of jalapenos would've been better instead of deep frying them.  ordered the AB burger with bacon. amazing. one of the best burgers i've had. came with a side of garlic fries. will definitely come back if i'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Ok, Yelp comes through once again. Saw all the recommendations on the peanut butter cup.  It was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.  If you like peanut butter and chocolate, this is your dessert!    Now, let's back up a bit and go back to the beginning part of my meal.  I had the tabbouleh salad and crab stuffed chicken.  I guess we were all thinking in synch because everyone at my table ordered the same thing.  The only odd thing is that one of the 4 people had a slightly smaller chicken piece.  Other than that, the dinner was delicious.  We sat in the outdoor seating, but I stepped inside periodically to check out the eclectic decor inside.  Lots of big screen TVs everywhere for sports fans.  Service was a little slow at first. Meaning, it took forever for them to bring waters and the drink orders, but once they did the food arrived not long after. But, we were part of a large group so that may have been part of the reason.   I would say It is still a solid place to have dinner with a large group."}
{"text":"Worth a try, but not a return visit.  First of all, the happy hour letdown. Be sure to sit at the bar to receive their happy hour deals. The hostess forgot to tell us this and by the time we switched over to the bar area it was packed. In terms of food selection, the happy hour is limited to five appetizers. The biggest highlight of the happy hour was their rum, lemon and berry compote cocktail, The Fix. They also have wine, beer and shot deals, so if you are just going out for drinks and need a place to validate your parking pass, then the Arrogant Butcher's happy hour might not disappoint.   Next up, the flavorless fare. I was really surprised by the how bland all of food was. The AB Cheeseburger with double the meat was pretty small and sad despite the double meat price tag. While the cheeseburger didn't taste bad, it certainly wasn't anything memorable. I also tried the Fish and Chips, which I would recommend avoiding unless you like your Fish and Chips quite greasy, with a heavy and smooth batter rather than the traditional thin and flaky batter. The Zucchini Fritters were bland on their own, but tasted okay with the parmesan aioli sauce. Maybe I caught this place on a bad day, but the food was certainly nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I went here thinking it was going to be great due to all the five reviews; however, it did not live up to the hype.   First, when my friend and I walked in we had to get the hostess attention. She asked how many and then literally went back to her computer without saying anything. We waited for a few moments and then asked whether or not there was a wait and if we should just sit down. She said no and continued to do nothing. Finally, a waitress sat us where she pointed to the table and threw the menus as she walked away. We got our waters without any straws and had to walk up to ask for some. The food was over priced for the portions we received and the strawberry lemonade was bitter for being four dollars. Though, the waiter we ended up getting was a kind gentleman.   Overall, the food was good but small and over priced, they seemed over staffed and not very busy but everything all together seem like a slow process. There were employees gathered at the back just talking and the managers didn't seem too friendly. I wouldn't go back or recommend this restaurant.  P.S. for being a meat based restaurant, they sure didn't have any sauces. They only had to offer ketchup, ranch, and blue cheese. No bar-b-que????"}
{"text":"The best Chef board in the valley!! It would be 5 stars but the hostesses are always really rude if you don't have a reservation. Even if you go when it's empty inside. Just have that as an expectation so it doesn't ruin your mood when you arrive. Other than the hostesses the service and vibe are great"}
{"text":"Food was great, lovedddd the butcher platter and the drinks were awesome! will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Happy hour until 6 e/ a decent selection of appetizers -Soft pretzels + cheese fondue -Bruschetta  -Location!!! Sit on the patio and watch the hubbub of US Airways center  Cons: -Not a huge vegan/vegetarian selection -Entree items were just okay -No official kids menu/ not the kid-friendliest place"}
{"text":"Very good place to day drink on a beautiful Saturday. The oyster and mussle bar was awesome,very fresh could taste the sea :) their cocktails a wonderful I had \"the last word\" and my boyfriend had \"the after school special\" very refreshing!   We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Turkey pastrami all the way. Some of the specialty drinks are hit & miss, but overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I was there a few days ago, my girlfriend and I sat at the bar, the bartender was on point, very tentative, and didn't have a problem putting on a hockey game when football was going on.   Service was great! Food was great!  Will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I had been anxiously anticipating when I was going to be able to try this place. I had heard so many good things from reviews and friends but I was underwhelmed with the food and the service.  We went during happy hour after we did the Yelp Shopping Crawl so the place was packed and the atmosphere was nice. We sat outside but the space heaters kept us nice and toasty.   We didn't have to wait to long before we got our drink orders in and we started off with an order of the soft pretzels and fondue. I have had this same dish at Culinary Dropout and they are so good (plus during happy hour they are a discounted price so even better).   I ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe which was pretty good (I did like it didn't fall apart like crazy), but I wished they noted that it comes with mayo on the menu. They didn't mind giving me a fresh bun that was mayo free. I really liked the side salad that came with it.   A friend ordered the beef burger and they got his order completely wrong and our server didn't seem to care. I hate making a big deal out of messed up orders since you never know if it was the kitchen or the server and people make mistakes, but I think they could of been a little better about it.   Everybody has a bad day occasionally, so I think I need to give this place another shot. The crabbed stuffed chicken sounds particularly tasty."}
{"text":"I had never heard of The Arrogant Butcher until last week when some friends and I were trying to decide where to meet for lunch. Needless to say, we chose somewhere else... so when I saw a Meetup group doing a happy hour here, I thought it was the perfect time to try it!  We ended up get the pretzel bread balls and fondue and the hummus. Both were amazing! The hummus was a little spicier than I thought it was going to be, but it was actually quite flavorful.  I kinda wished we stayed for dinner since there was so many things on the menu that sounded delicious. I'd definitely go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Never Disappoints  The Arrogant Butcher was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Arrogant Butcher is  trendy and has a relaxing vibe.  As we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who made us feel genuinely welcome. Then a few minutes later our server, added to that feeling. All our questions were answered about the menu, and our server made suggestions based on our perferences.  We started our dining expeirence with appetizers, which were delicious.  I highly recommend the freshly made pretzel balls served with provolone cheese fondue. The pretzels are so fresh and fluffy, our server told us the pretzels are made on site every day. On this visit we also sampled the roasted peppers toast, smoked salmon toast, and the prosciutto deviled eggs.  All which I would order again.    For dinner I had the sea bass with creamy barley.  My entree  was absolutely delicious.  My dinner companions had the crab stuffed chicken which he said was the best he ever had. The portions were the perfect size and cooked to perfection.   As good as the entrees were, they were matched by the dessert selections.  We split the salted caramel pudding (my favorite), the peanut butter cup, and the pumpkin cheesecake, you couldn't go wrong with any of those. The desert were fantastic.  The service was perfect and our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Halfway through my meal, I wondered if the Arrogant Butcher is authentic and real as the Grouchy Chef of Mukilteo or the Soupman (Soup Nazi) of Hell's Kitchen.  There's something about bad behavior accepted widely in restaurants. Disappointingly, an arrogant butcher is a concept, not a reality.  WHY GO THERE? Good selection of comfort food in a hip industrial space. On a nice day, outside seating means people watching.  WHATCHAGOT? I enjoyed the Turkey Pastrami served in a pretzel bun. It's a marriage made in split-personality heaven: turkey meets pastrami, pretzel meets bun.  Crispy rock shrimp is great tasting appetizer. On Mondays, I like the special meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Good selection of cocktails.  YOU GOT SERVED. Water doesn't go dry.  Service is attentive. There's nothing arrogant about this place."}
{"text":"Perfect name.  Terrible meal. I get why diners might enjoy this place.  Convenient, cool decor, good happy hour. However I was there to eat dinner.  I ordered soup of the day and a Brussel sprout Caesar salad to save room for dessert.  The soup for the day was split pea with ham,  one of my favorites. Terrible. Tasted like canned soup watered down. Brussel sprout Caesar salad contained chunks of bitter red cabbage and barely discernible traces of Brussel sprouts. I thought well at least there is dessert. How can warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato be bad? It can, trust me. It was a bowl of molten oversweetened peanut butter pudding with the tiniest portion of chocolate gelato known to man. Alongside we're 2 cookies that were surely pillsbury refrigerated dough with a lone chocolate chip in the center. Disgusting is not too strong a term. Disappointed is how this dinner left this diner."}
{"text":"Pretzel Bites with Provolone....I'm not the chick who runs to the pretzel place in the mall like I haven't eaten in weeks. Not really a pretzel aficionado! However, these may bring me over to the twisted side!  Light, square, perfectly baked and salted...and the provolone? WOW! Delish!  Presentation is simple, yet impressive! Dinner is a New York Strip with Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Asparagus! Delicious and prepared perfectly! We will definitely come here again...the dessert menu beckons!"}
{"text":"My wonderful Yelpy App helped me discover this place while at a conference at the PCC. Myself and four friends came here for happy hour after our conference and were not let down. We were immediately seated in the patio and greeted by a very friendly server. Since we had never been here he was very helpful in explaining the menu, happy hour options, and making recommendations. We took a little while to decide, but they were patient and accommodating. Between the four of us, we ordered \"The Mule\", \"The Maid and \"The Fix\" as drinks and \"The House Soft Pretzels,\" \"The Artichoke Hummus,\" \"The Zucchini Fritters,\" and a cheese plate to split. All were delicious. However, there is a reason that the Pretzels and Fondue are mentioned in 53 reviews! If you come here for nothing else, at least try these once in your life. Each of us ended up liking the others' drink and for our second round ordered two Mules and two Maids. Our waiters knew there were four of us, yet they only brought two pieces of bread with the cheese plate. This made us all look at each other awkwardly, and we had to wait a little bit before we got more bread, but this really wasn't a huge deal in the overall experience.  Yes, I switched our server from he to they, because all of a sudden it seemed like we had four different waiters. I'm not sure how they did it, but every time we needed something, any server would help us, bring us what we needed, and the other servers somehow seemed to know what the others had done. If this was just a fluke then it went over just fine, but if this is their serving concept, I recommend that they explain it when they approach the table. A lot of other reviewers have mentioned the awesome atmosphere, corner hugging location, and decor, and I must agree that this place has it all. Upon sitting, I immediately recognized the red metal chairs and asked if this was a FOX concept, because they were the exact same ones I had sat in at the newly redesigned NoRTH in Tucson. Now I see why they were trying to duplicate the look of the Phoenix location, it's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I use this place for business meetings. The food is great and the service is fast. I have never had to wait and everyone is really friendly. They also have a pretty good beer selection."}
{"text":"Attended a birthday party here. The food was AMAZING especially the BEEF SHORT RIB stew, highly recommend. I also really liked the Salted Caramel pudding, it was to die for! Overall, the service was stellar and the ambiance was just right for the start of a wonderful night! Great job! I will be coming back...and so will the other 20 people in our large party! No one had any complaints."}
{"text":"Walked here from the Sheraton food was good and the service was friendly! I had the short rib stew would happily eat it again."}
{"text":"Kale and Smoked Salmon salad - blows your mind!  Finish it off with this crazy peanut butter fluff treat at the end.   Crazy good food."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD. AWESOME SERVICE. We had a few servers throughout the evening as I believe we arrived during a shift change. Nonetheless, we still had EXCELLENT customer service throughout the transition (especially before a SUNS game- busy time). The manager, Joshua was great. He validated our parking ticket and ensured our check was accurate. Highly recommend this awesome restaurant. ***TRY THE MULES!!!"}
{"text":"Been in downtown Phoenix for a week, never eaten at the same place twice.  Far and away the best place we've had yet.  Yes, it's expensive (I'm not from a major metro area), but so has been everywhere else I've eaten.  Came for lunch, sat at the bar in front o the chefs.  The chefs talked to us like we were old friends, the wait staff was SUPER attentive, and truly knew their menu and product.  I never had an empty drink glass.  I was refilled before it was empty all throughout lunch.  We all had the Prime Rib French Dip (w/carmelized onions, per the chef's suggestion).  Also had a piece of aged chedder w/cherry marmalade and brioche - So very tasty, and the flavors complemented each other perfectly!  OMG, amazeballs!  Great job guys, I hope you keep things just how they are for a good, long (and profitable!) time."}
{"text":"Been here three or four times now and frankly just do not think it's worth it given the occasional attitude and what you actually get.  If it was horrible I would have rated it lower so obviously it's a decent place.  I have no issue with spending money for great food and service period.  Tonight wasn't happy but still tipped the server 60 bucks on a 280 tab.  I would say the bar tends to be underwhelming over all three visits.  There are simple drinks they just don't know how to make and literally have had to tell them how.  My friend and I asked for an old fashioned but light on the simple syrup because we want to taste the whiskey.  He did a pretty decent job but the waitress almost went out of her way to tell us that she didn't pass our request on because she knows that they would never do that.  Ok, interesting and weird. Prime rib, Waldorf salad, burger and sea bass were the entrees.  We tried the board beforehand.  The board was ok but very little meat for what they charge.  The sea bass was fishy smelling and all of us eat seafood often and noticed it.  The burger was supposed to have some additional items like ketchup, mustard and tomato but received none of the above.  Prime rib was tasty but was told by server that they don't have real horseradish, only the creamy version. Asked another guy for it and he brought the real stuff out.  She didn't deserve the solid tip but we're not assholes so we left it anyways.  Either way, the 4 of us have probably spent close to $1000 over the last couple months at this place and won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Definitely recommend this restaurant for the great food, excellent service, and cool atmosphere. It was a busy day and a few conversations had just let out but our wait time to be seated was only a few minutes.  We were greeted by our waiter who made some great suggestions.  We ordered the charcuterie platter and the deviled eggs.  The eggs had a TON of garlic so beware of garlic breath.   The table next to us had been waiting a few extra minutes because of the convention rush and our waiter was so apologetic and brought them a completely item and made sure they had their drinks refreshed.  Our amazing waiter also brought us the artichoke hummus (which was super yummy) to thank us for our patience during our wait.  We eat out a lot, and this was a normal wait time but I appreciate him going the extra mile.  For lunch we ordered fish tacos and the New York.  When we asked to hold the butter on the steak, the waiter mentioned there was dairy in the potato accompaniments and offered to substitute vegetables without us even asking.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the fish was super fresh.   At the end of the meal he brought us ice tea to go since it's so hot and gave us tips on parking and offered to validate for us.  Great food, and great experience."}
{"text":"Was here couple days ago for a Pre-Xmas dinner get together with some girl friends. We waited about 25 mins or so before we got a table. We sat at the patio where the corner diagonal from the US Airway. Since there are heaters and the weather was not too cold so it was very nice and enjoyed the view. Everyone in our group ordered the Chicken Fried Pork Chop except me. I had the Scallops. When the food brought out together, the Scallops were cold. My guess was maybe they waited until all the food is ready and brought them out together and mine was the first one done and waiting for the rest to be cooked. Anyway, I was not going to mention to the waitress but my friend suggested that I should for what I am paying for. So I told one of the staff that was nearby and he was very nice and offered me that they can make me a new one and apologized for it. After about 10-15 mins later they brought a new plate and warned me the plate is very hot. This time the Scallops were too salty, I thought it might just me so I had a friend tried the cauliflower that came with and was salty as well. Since I was so hungry and everyone was done with their food so I didn't say anything to the waitress. Besides that, everything else was great. I highly recommend the Tabbouleh Salad and the desserts were good too. We had Warm Peanut Butter Cup and Blueberry Cheesecake."}
{"text":"What a special  treat!   I came here with 3 of my friends and our server was so friendly, prompt and positive.   I had soup and a side house salad. The soup had bacon flavor and was just amazing.... I wish I could remember the name of it because I seriously want to go back and have more.   I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the smoked salmon rillette. Outstanding! Next had the burger and was as good. The service is over the top and Ian was awesome!"}
{"text":"Just finished a delicious dinner at The Arrogant Butcher! Arrived downtown during a DBacks game, but we were still able to secure some of the best seats in the house with no wait. I highly recommend sitting at the kitchen bar if you get a chance. Brian & Brian (unless they were kidding us) were great to watch at the apps/salad station. The charcutterie (salumi, pate, cheeses, antipasta) is the way to go!! We sampled salumi, pate, olives, elephant garlic, and a brie like goat cheese. It was the highlight of the meal!  We also ordered the soft pretzles & cheese fondue, which was good. I prefered the mustard that was paired with the meats on my pretzle pieces. My husband had the prime rib special which he said was quite good, and I had the sweet potato tortillone. It was also very good.  Next time, and there will be a next time, we plan to skip the entrees in favor of more from the antipasta options & hit up the salted caramel pudding dessert!  The only reason I cannot give my visit 5 stars is that one of the managers rudely and vulgarly reprimanded one of the chefs right in front of us. I had been having a great time until then. I didn't appreciate the cursing & I certainly didn't need to be a part of seeing a person belittled & demeaned with my dinner experience."}
{"text":"At happy hour on a Tuesday. Food and drinks are a bit limited but that's typical  for HH. Loving the artichoke hummus accompanied with the Fix cocktail. Hummus is warm with a tinge of sweetness. Goes well with the Fix which is a bit tart. Happy crowd, bartender not very attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and atmosphere.   Yo Yo"}
{"text":"Okay so server was rude and acted like we were bothering him by patronizing the restaurant but we persevered and ended up with some amazing and flavorful cuisine. We sat outside so we got to people watch the Phoenix locals. Definitely interesting for us being were SF bay Area locals."}
{"text":"Pricey, lively, loud and pretty good. This place was hoppin' the night we stopped in for dinner. Fortunately we didn't wait long for a table. Our server was very friendly, helpful and attentive.  My wife and I enjoyed the food but given it's location and prices, we probably won't be returning here anytime soon.  We're also older and this place is decidedly oriented toward a younger, rowdier demographic."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because of the service. The food was incredible. I highly recommend the Butcher Platter charcuterie board for an appetizer. So many great flavors and textures! 2 of us ate it but it could be stretched to 3. For my entree I ordered the New York Strip. 12oz! It was a very hearty portion. It melted in my mouth. Perfect temperature of medium rare as well. The mashed potatoes weren't as creamy as I prefer but still great and so we're the Brussel sprouts. My friend ordered the crab stuffed chicken which he said was absolutely delicious too. We topped it off with the warm peanut butter cup. We couldn't eat another bite! Though our server kept our glasses full, he spoke to us only once in almost 2 hours to ask me how the temperature was on my steak; not how everything was. It was just a bit odd."}
{"text":"After a \"rigorous\" evening of flow yoga at Lustre Bar upstairs, my friends and I were hungry and found ourselves at The Arrogant Butcher. I've always wanted to try this place and despite my friends wanting to get \"salads\" and the title of the restaurant didn't really yell salads, I made them come here and I was extremely glad I did!  I learned several things that evening!  1. Order the Candlestick Maker. (Well, if you're a bourbon fan like me!) It has Makers 46, lemon, Thatcher's Spiced Apple, honey and angostura  2. Order the Old Fashioned. (They do it right here!)  3. Share the Penn Cove Mussels with a friend -  Spicy Salumi, Charred Tomato,   Grilled Bread  4. Enjoy the house soft pretzels with provolone fondue. - You may also want to share this one, but who knows, maybe you're extra hungry with those cocktails and want something to \"absorb\" the potency of those cocktails.   We enjoyed ourselves so much here that we were there past when the kitchen closed. To my dismay, I didn't know that the kitchen closed at 9pm, and my husband, who was at home, wanted something to eat. When the waiter informed me the kitchen closed, I shamefully whined, \"Wait! I was supposed to bring home something for my husband! You can't let me go home empty handed. He'd be so angry with me.\" The waiter then asked me if I knew what I wanted to order to go. I said, \"The short rib stew!\" He answered, \"Well let me see what we can do..\" He then proceeded to head to the kitchen. My anxiety reached all new heights as I awaited his response. It wasn't long before he returned and said, \"We still have some stew, which means, yes, you can still get it to go!\" I was so elated! I loudly exclaimed, \"You and the kitchen just made my night!!!\" I love how accommodating they were there! This is a great example of how great their service is!!  5. So the whole point of this story above is... Spectacular food (at least the stuff I tried that night), stupendous service, and too cool to be kitsch décor yet almost farm like and trendy. I will always recommend and return to this place again, because I love them!"}
{"text":"The manager on Saturday night was great! The staff was kind and made a lasting impression on my sister and I.  Food was great."}
{"text":"Wanted a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel so picked this one.  Was ok:  Nothing major to complain about, but also really nothing to rave about either.  There are better restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Not worth it.. kinda misleading. We both had crab stuffed chicken. (Grilled) but it was breaded. I didnt think (i myself is a good cook/chef) didnt think it was worth $24 and being breaded when it states grilled (which i cant have bread) .. didnt think it was flavorful kinda bland... environment was nice thou/people watch outdoor which we enjoyed.. limited menu and kinda pricey..."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and it did not disappoint they have a great happy hour and a large patio that's awesome for people watching.  I got a specialty cocktail for $4 called the fix which was refreshing and delicious. Vodka with mint and berry puree.   We ordered several plates of oysters, which adds up at $2.50 each. The mineit sauce came with the oysters was fantastic, but the oysters did have quite a few shells in them.  They need to be more consistent with the plating the first plate had yummy veggies on it second one didn't.  The pretzel fondue was very good too. I can't wait to come back and try dinner soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink before a Suns game ... They were pretty busy (as are all the places right before the game) but we got a table for 4 pretty quickly.  I only had the hummus, but it was so amazingly addicting, I can't wait to go back and have it again.  I also had the Candlestick Maker... a wickedly delicious concoction of Maker's 46, lemon, apple and honey.  So good, I had a 2nd one. =)   There aren't many main entrees that appeal to me, but I would go back for a couple more of those apps!"}
{"text":"Great gastropub across the street from the Phoenix Sun's arena. The light rail stop is just a block away.  Recommendations: 1) Fried Chicken, Honey Biscuit & Coleslaw 2) New York Strip Steak, Brussel Sprouts & Smashed Potatoes  3) Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there on a Saturday night recently and must say that we really enjoyed the experience.   Our server was very friendly and made some excellent suggestions based up our tastes.    Yes, it is a little pricey but I firmly believe that you get what you pay for.  The ambiance was very cool and the food was quality.  I got the bbq ribs and I must say that they were delicicious.    Make reservations as it can get pretty crowded."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! We were seated quickly - every single staff member we came in contact with had a smile, went above and beyond and had a conversation! We sat next to the kitchen and they explained what they were cooking and kept us entertained! Can't say enough amazing things"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful filet mignon at this fine restaurant the service was excellent they wanted our steaks to be just perfect what a great atmosphere this is the best filet mignon I've ever had and I am from Texas and I know what I'm talking about Trye the food wonderful"}
{"text":"Came in during happy hour and enjoyed every second. The food was great and I needed to order a second basket of fries (geez those are good). The burger was amazing, the scallops were freakin awesome and the salted caramel desert......WOW! Good service and an neat environment! Must visit if you are in town!!!"}
{"text":"My boss and I came up on this place riding around looking for a place to have dinner.  We are here on business so don't know the area. We didn't have a reservation, but was seated right away. I wasn't disappointed with my food choice.  We share the soft pretzel and cheese fondue. I had the slow roasted prime rib plate for my entree, and it was cooked to perfection.  All in all a good experience.  My only disappointment was while parking in the garage nowhere did it state you should bring your ticket into the restaurant to have it validated to avoid paying parking.  Upon reaching the exit, the gentleman quoted $16.  I stated I had just finished eating at \"The Arrogant Butcher\", and I had my receipt to prove it.  He stated he couldn't use the receipt and I would have to go back to get the ticket stamped to avoid the charge.  That was easier said then done; there vehicles behind me.  I hesitantly and very disappointed paid."}
{"text":"Had dinner @thearrogantbutcher and the sweet waitress accidentally spilled soda all over our entire table and my husband!! She looked absolutely horrified and was so apologetic! We understand that sometimes accidents happen so we were on our best behavior. Dinner was delish and the manager even comp'ed our entire tab! We left her a little note and a tip to cheer her up.   But onto the important stuff...  The jambalaya was great. A little spicy, lots of proteins (chicken, Cajun sausage, shrimp), and I loved the addition of okra! Some places make their jambalaya too wet and it becomes mush. But this place makes it perfectly moist.  The short rib green chili stew was the best! Super flavorful and spicy. It comes with a sweet cornbread which is the perfect compliment to the spicy savory of the stew.  Great for big groups, lots of room, good food, and friendly service. If you're in the downtown Phoenix area, check out this place."}
{"text":"Great food was impressed with the food we received had the tortellini and fried fish. Service seemed a bit slow."}
{"text":"I am fan of a any fox concept restaurants and was really happy when they opened one downtown. I normally go here for lunch a few times a month. I would highly recommend their turkey pastrami sand which which is on a pretzel roll and is amazing. I also get it served with a chopped salad to try to make my lunch a little healthier and love whatever dressing they use."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Arrogant Butcher I just can't get enough of the kale salad with salmon but I've been on a mission to try everything on the menu!  The staff has always been wonderful and so helpful, if I lived closer I'd be there all the time :)"}
{"text":"Arrogant Butcher is exactly what Downtown Phoenix has needed for awhile: a restaurant with a great atmosphere, yummy food, friendly staff and one that takes reservations!   This afternoon, I dined here for lunch and was pleased from the get-go. I arrived a little bit before my fellow lunchers, so I put our name in. It must have been perfect timing because about ten minutes later, the place had a line out the door. So for note one, I say to come at off hours, so for example, come at 11:50 instead of 12.   The atmosphere here is open, airy and fresh. I love the sidewalk patio and the windows so that even if you aren't eating outside, you can still experience the fresh air and outdoor feel. The bar is seated in the middle and I noticed several local brews on tap. I also noticed several tasty drinks such as a skinny berry mojito. Since it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, I didn't get the chance to try it, but you better believe that I will definitely be back!   Now let's move on to the food. Have you been to Culinary Dropout? If you answered yes, then you will be well familiar with this food. Sam Fox did an excellent job of mirroring the menu from his Scottsdale restaurant for the Arrogant Butcher. I saw that they have a similar Turkey Pastrami on the menu and I was told that the sweet potato tortellinis are to die for, more like dessert. Unfortunately, I personally didn't try either, but I did have the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh with avocado added. It came in a rather large bowl and I will admit that I ate every last bite it was so good. The dressing is an Oregano vinaigrette and the salad is graced with grilled chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, almonds and a couple other secret ingredients they didn't list on the menu.   After our \"ladies who lunch\" 'esque meal, the staff happily validated our parking (making my parking free!) and sent us on our way. As we walked out the doors, we were met with the carpenters union who decided that today was the day to protest, but that's what happens when you're in a real city right? And if that's the case, Downtown Phoenix...you are well on your way!  This seems like the perfect spot to eat at before a game, especially since they accept reservations and they are across the street from the stadiums! I did overhear the hostess say that there aren't many tables that seat more than six, so if you are coming with a large party, you should probably call ahead to ensure seating.   Bravo Sam Fox. Another job well-done."}
{"text":"This is what I call OMG food AND service.  I was visiting Phoenix for the PFChangs RnR Marathon and was just walking by this place.  Stopped in for what I thought would be just a \"bar food\" quick lunch.  I had the BLT and the Market salad.  They were orgasmic...yes, I said orgasmic.  The waitress was so incredibly nice, and the chef even came out and talked to us because we were so oh'g and ah'g over his food.  A MUST GO if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a business trip and chose the restaurant based on the proximity to my hotel and the good reviews on Yelp.  It is conveniently located in the downtown area.  The restaurant is housed in a warehouse/loft and you can feel the energy and liveliness when you walk in.  I started out with the beet salad which was outstanding.  The dressing has a subtle sweetness and acidity and the whole dish was fresh and satisfying.  I like the added textures that the pistachios, green beans, and asparagus contributed.  The grilled salmon was a tad bit over seasoned, but otherwise it was perfectly cooked and tasty.  It was served with green beans, smoked potatoes, and a very yummy sweet corn puree which complimented the fish.  I finished the meal off with the hot chocolate cake which was delicious.    My server was attentive and I had a great overall experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. Issue with server, took US finding manager and asking him to come to our table to resolve the issue. An hour after trying to begin our checkout, we were finally paid out. Poor customer service; poorly managed."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. Neither time was remarkable, good or bad. Service was spotty with the bartenders being the most disappointing, host and wait staff better. The food and layout resemble more of a tired chain than an interesting establishment sporting this name. There are few great options in this area (IMO), so not a bad choice if needing a quick bite or drink and you are close. If have a bit more time, opt to go toward the Roosevelt area and settle into a proper cocktail and meal."}
{"text":"I lobe this place every time I come. Great location in Phoenix for a \"city\" day. The food is always great and the service is good. If your catching a game or seeing a concert this is a great spot to go to before and walk over."}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 head there for lunch. Only 8 of us stayed after the long wait (we had a reservation). We didn't get our food until over an hour after we were seated. I ended up ordering an appetizer, which was pretty good. One of my friends sent her burger back because it had a funny smell. Everyone else enjoyed their food.  The server was pretty awesome. The hostess that seated us was sweet, but the other girls were surprisingly snooty.  The food was a tad overpriced.  It's not a bad place to grab a bit to eat downtown, but I don't see myself going there again."}
{"text":"Very very small portions for the price. Food was very basic, not anything to brag about or even bother going a second time. Service was ok. Priced wrong for the salad but didn't have time to point it out. Salad was not flavorful, turkey sloppyjoe was plain and the turkey sandwich was just ok. Spent about $45 for only 3 people and left hungry."}
{"text":"I caught up with my girl for happy hour at this spanking new restaurant and since it was a beautiful day outside we chatted it up outside. From what I saw the place was filled with a young professional crowd and a sprinkle of folks that were in town for a convention. I had a glass of chardonnay and the pretzel bites with cheese fondue...I was surprised something so simple could be sooo good!   I will def. be back so I can dine inside and eat off of the regular menu."}
{"text":"I was reasonably impressed with AB. We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal.   We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me.   The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird \"arrogant\" staring at you.   I do plan on returning for dinner, to see what catches my eye."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal with some unusual but very good twists. Good value Convenient location to convention center and sports arena.  Very busy place, but did not ever feel rushed"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my wife after the Suns/Warriors game. We wanted to go somewhere in walking distance and this restaurant is really close to the talking stick arena. We started out with the Brussels sprouts Caesar salad. The dressing was amazing but I wouldn't really call this a Brussels sprouts Caesar because there were barely any Brussels sprouts in the salad. My wife got a half dozen of the blue point oysters and she really enjoyed those. It was a Sunday night and there special was their Chicken Pot Pie which was very tasty. It is extremely rich though, my wife and I were sharing it and we still couldn't finish it. It had great flavor with all the veggies and nice pieces of chicken. My only complaint is that I wish the base of the soup was a little looser because it was super thick and almost gelatiness at times. Overall a cool restaurant but it is on the pricey side. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here since it's in a busy area of downtown but if I'm down there for a sporting event then I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I went here for a recruiting event. The bruschetta and pretzels were both very good. The business did a great job of using the space and keeping the food at the right temperature. If I still lived in AZ, I would go back. It's a little pricey for what you get but definitely still good."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Love the appetizer hummus and nachos. Ordered the sea scallops, which were awesome until I pulled out 3 4 inch pieces of hair. I know it wasn't mine because my hair is blond and 18 inches. Only ate two of the scallops. Manager comped the meal, which was great for my billion dollar company, as it was our holiday dinner, but I went home hungry and bummed.  hair nets are there for a reason."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Fox Concepts.  Food and service are great!  It is a little difficulty to get into, so make sure you get reservations.  If you are going to a concert or sporting event make reservations way beforehand."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. Ordered their newest appetizer plate filled with all sorts of yummy things. The best was the sweet potato bites wrapped in bacon. There were some thinly sliced salumi and prosciutto to lay atop the toasted and drizzled with balsamic slices of french bread. A soft spreadable cheese and a buttery chunk cheese. A wonderful little pot of salmon confit. The madeleines were actually jalapeño cornbread! Some marinated olives and a few stuffed Peppadews. The deviled eggs were the only thing in need of a bit more. Perhaps a splash of spice? Overall, the most amazing meal I've had to date in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I came here after a baseball game..  Easy access, and I only dinged them a star because they ran out of the one item I was interested in.   Note to self:  come early if you want the entire menu available: the food is THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"Sadly, the food is really delicious at the Arrogant Butcher, but waiting 1.5+ hours for our meals THEN subsequently finding a hair on the plate was truly unacceptable.  You will not be seeing me again Arrogant Butcher. And I would not be able to recommend this place due to the fact that they only wanted to compensate us with a $6 dessert. Really? That's all you can do for a $100 dinner? Appalling.   We waited over an hour an a half for a medium rare filet mignon, and a hamburger. THEN once we were eating there was a hair UNDER the creamed spinach on the filet mignon's plate. My hair is brown and curly and 6+ inches long. My companion's hair is blond and about 3+ inches long. The hair on the plate was black and thick and about 1.5inches long. Yet you refused to comp us anything but a $6 dessert? Really?? Really? Arrogant indeed"}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with FOX. I am not much of a meat eater, but when I want meat I want a good bloody piece of steak and Arrogant Butcher did not disappoint. Its not the best steak I've had, but the service, sides, drinks and atmosphere def. make for an overall great dining experience."}
{"text":"Many, many open tables and yet a 45 minute wait?  How can you not handle volume at your location in the center of town?  Understaffed?  The meal was excellent and the service, once we got it, was exemplary. Seems to be a scheduling issue. Definitely will go back when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A couple reasons why this place didn't get 5 Stars...  1. Hours of operation. This restaurant clearly resembles a bar like atmosphere, however having the huge bar in the middle, it does not stay open late. Week nights 9pm and Weekend 10pm close time.   2. The excitement put off from the person who looked like he was a manager of some sort, definitely killed the vibe by hounding the kitchen staff about completing orders in a timely manner. The restaurant was not slammed at all and the staff was moving quick as it is. I came here upon recommendation and after hearing the excitement put off, it definitely killed the experience.   Don't get me wrong tho, the food was delicious! I went with the Fish Tacos being that the kitchen was \"closing\" and I wanted to be mindful of the staff. And the Bartender fixed me a nice Jameson and Pineapple which complimented my dinner.   Will I go back? Yes I most likely will and not around closing time."}
{"text":"What can I say...great service by Andrew, good selection of beers...loved the fresh squeezed ipa, charcuterie of smoked ham and  sharp aged cheddar yum, and entrees delish.  We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Ian did a great job  Food was good  Desserts were the bomb  Good wine All of the staff were very personal  Good price value"}
{"text":"Amazing place, cured meats, cheeses. Great service, full bar and beer options. The wedge salad is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had a really delicious meal. Our server was really  friendly and helpful, did a Google search on where to go dancing  in the area. The food was good and came out really quick. Had oysters on the half which were delicious. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very nice higher end type of gastropub right in the stadium district of downtown Phoenix.  Food was restaurant quality on the entrees and bar quality on the appetizers.  The drink options were a little week in my opinion considering the pub-like atmosphere and location to a sporting venue haven.    We began with the buffalo chicken appetizer.  Sauce was underwhelming, especially after the waiter hyped it up so much.  The wings themselves were dry rubbed rather than wet which I typically don't like anyways.  Tasty but not the best buffalo app I've had.  The cheese ravioli was cooked perfectly, slightly under-cooked, and huge portion size.  The scallops was an interesting dish at a pub, but considering Arrogant likes to promote their raw bar, I had to give it a go.  The entire dish was fantastic from the brussel and green side to the scallops themselves.  Big dish once again and very well presented.  We finally ordered the blueberry cheesecake.  Tasty graham cracker topping and perfect compliment dessert all around for our meal.  Drinks were limited for draft and bottle beers.  They had some nice champagne and wine by the glass, but nothing too absurd.  We ordered an incredible rose sparkling wine for $50 and it was well worth the price tag.    In total, the meal came out to about $130 in all.  Pretty cheap considering the quality and the amount of food and booze.  Arrogant Butcher is rightfully so a staple of Phoenix.  Crowds are expected so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great spot for pre game or business lunch. Excellent value!"}
{"text":"First time and last time here. We went for happy hour but didn't know we had to tell the hostess we want to sit in the happy hour section. Waited twice for a table. Pretzel bites were great and a good value. Antipasta plate did not have much on it for the $8 spent. I had the mule. Very disappointing since we had just left Bitter & Twisted and had amazing cocktails there, only to come here for a sugary pre made drink mix. With so many great places to go downtown, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food made by owner. Meat shop that's local  Clean, but it is a meat market.  Friendly, nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into the door, until we left, service was the key word.  A nice comfortable atmosphere, with amazing food, great service, and pretty affordable pricing, made this a great spot for our company dinner.  We walked out full, and with a great feeling.  Definitely a spot to check out."}
{"text":"Another overpriced place where you pay 14 bucks for a small plate with 7 tiny pieces of meat in which most are too fatty to eat. Great customer service. But overpriced with crap food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and our server was AWESOME!!! However, I was not impressed with the gluten free options, especially with it being a Fox restaurant. When I asked the hostess if there is a gluten free menu and she said 'no, but anything can be made gluten free'. However, that is not the case. I decided on getting the fish tacos and they were less than average. I love Fox Restaurants, but won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great location and I love eating outside.  The food is great, service is great, drinks / happy hour is great, too! Great spot to try downtown!"}
{"text":"Hamburger was burned on the outside and cold on the inside, and even the buns were burned. The service was bad. We couldn't get anyone to help us. I asked for ketchup 3 times from 2 different people. It was a really simple request, but it never came.   Poor service & poor food. I wouldn't go back. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place for its pretzel bread fondue and salted caramel pudding! I've been here twice now with coworkers for lunch and I dream of the next time just so I can have the appetizer and dessert, I don't even remember what my main course was, but it was good, too."}
{"text":"Way too salty. Seriously, even the bread was too salty. The scallop dish was creative but the salt levels ruined it. Super expensive given the very small portions and few ingredients.  The service was slow and unattentive. Saw our waitress only twice. The hostess texted that our table was ready but had no idea what table it was and kept us waiting at the counter another 10 minutes to figure it out.   The drinks were good. I liked the pink drink."}
{"text":"Hands down you're going to have a delicious meal when you come here! Everything from the appetizer, to the entrees, to the dessert - everything is freaking delicious! I definitely recommend trying their truffle cheese... seriously to die for. And their pretzel  fondue is amazing! I got their sweet potato tortellini which was recommended by our waiter and he was not lying, it truly is delicious! And even though you'll probably fill up on all of their delicious appetizers, make sure to save room for dessert! Their sea salt caramel pudding is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"First time at Arrogant Butcher. I was there for lunch and impressed with the menu. I will have to come back and try their raw bar, cheeses, meats, and apps! I ordered the Turkey Pastrami with fries. It was soooo good! The meat was seasoned to perfection. The fries tasted and looked home made. They also put some sauce on the sandwich that was killer, yum!   Service: They have the right amount of people, now they just have to figure out the glitches. Nothing HUGE, just minor things I would have changed. (I use to be a server in college my days, so I have high expectations) One server though was odd, he kept saying weird things. I don't remember what the word was but he said it to everyone at my table. I didn't mind but my conservative co-worker was taken a back so it made me feel awkward.   Def. coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place for pre-game beers and a crafty burger."}
{"text":"Never a big fan of DT Phoenix because of its traffic, but I was in the area and looking for a great place for lunch. So decided to go to Arrogant Butcher because of its rave reviews. Pretty packed during lunch hour, but got a seat right away at the bar. I know a lot of people recommended the app: House Soft Pretzel and Provolone Fondue, but didn't feel like it. Instead, I ordered Crispy Shrimp with Shishito Peepers & Spicy Aioli. For entree I ordered BBQ Half Chicken Plate served with Potato Puree, Gren Chile Cornbread, Coleslaw and BBQ Chicken Jus. The app was good but quite greasy on the bottom. The main dish was also okay, the chicken was not as flavorful as I expected. The bartender's service was great, he was busy but still able to be attentive. I'll give this place another try and order something else if I am around the area again."}
{"text":"Very bad mother's day special prime rib.  Ordered rare, got brown, no red, no juices coming out.  They said they could not do better.   We requested bread and that seemed unusual and a problem.  We finally got it with our bad meal.  We order a side of asparagus, since they said no sides come with it.  The asparagus was overcooked and served cold.  This is not a place for meat eaters."}
{"text":"Good pretzel/fondue appetizer.  Good zucchini fritters.  However----- They have no idea how to prepare meat. I asked for a medium well filet. I received rare, sent it back, received another medium rare, sent it back, third try was a bit better. I was able to eat the edges. My dining companions were done with there meals well before I was served an edible (to me) dinner. Awful. Manager was apologetic and comped my meal."}
{"text":"Typical Sam Fox.  Good, but nothing I'd scream and rave about.  Solid comfort food, a little on the heavy side for my taste.  The menu has been through a few changes.  The salads are good, (although the salmon one is not my favorite).  The HH appetizers are actually better than the lunch offerings.  There is a pretzel fondue that is amazingly delicious (you know exactly how bad it is for you).  They have house made chips with their own french ranch dip that is amazing.  The cheese plate is good, they will always push the charceurterie plate on you when you enter the restaurant.  You can always orrder a pre-assembled one on the menu.  the drinks are strong and delicious.  One of the favorites is the skinny raspberry mojito which should be served in pitchers.  The rest of the drinks are tasty and pack a decent punch.  HH is still the best way to try it out.  It's a great downtown location and chances are you will run into a ton of lawyers or lobbyests.  It's a power place and its nicer than Tom's Tavern."}
{"text":"Awesome service and even better food. Incredible food. I had the scallops, my brother had salmon. Mom had beet salad. We also had desert. We each had something different. All were fantastic. Already planning a return and we live 700 miles away. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. Great food, great location, great atmosphere, and some of the best service I have ever had.  I had the New York strip steak (naturally) medium rare, which the waiter guessed what I was ordering exactly correct pretty cool. The steak was top 3 for and reasonably priced. Best of all it was cooked to perfection. This paired with an excellent beverage selection. I couldn't have been happier!"}
{"text":"I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars. In fact, I wish we were using Star Search scoring because I'd give 3 and 3 quarters stars.   Really cool decor. Like a retro, train station kinda feel. There were these ginormous beehive lamp shade light fixtures that weren't cohesive and I wish they'd take them out because they were an eyesore as well. The restrooms were splendid, very clean, nice large stalls. Aside from the snooty hostesses, the service was splendid.   My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week. It was packed when we arrived at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, I would recommend rezzies. For starters my friend had the soup and I had the cheese plate, both were delish. The cheese plate came with the cutest, tiny spoons and jars for jam and mustard... took everything I had to not put them in my purse. I can't remember what my main dish was called but it was two pieces of fried fish with a crab cake in the middle, topped with gravy and capers and a side of steamed spinach. It tasted like really good cafeteria food, nothing to write about here. For dessert I had the blueberry something or other. It tasted exactly like a pretzel torte I use to make in my early 20's, tasty but again, nothing to write home about.   I will becoming back for sure. I know they're has to be more to that kitchen that what I was served, I just know it!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar here a few times. Can't comment too much on the food but I've always had impeccable service.  Brittany is THE best.  After looking at the drink list and being indecisive she immediately told me not to worry and whipped up a cocktail just for me. It was pink, sweet, but not too sweet and just the ticket! Many thanks to Brittany for going above and beyond, she apologized when our pretzel bites were a little cold and took care of it promptly.  Checked on us numerous times (something I myself as a former server value a lot).  Pretzel Bites and cheese sauce: Amazing Amazing Amazing Simple chopped salad: simple yet delish Meatloaf: not your mommas (in a good way)  Will def return to try more food! Very impressed! Check menu online for the special of the day, fried chicken and waffles on Thursday :)"}
{"text":"We had about a 30-40 minute wait, but it was a Friday night and game day for the Suns. We were actually seated faster than expected. Food was excellent. Lots of great options. Loved sitting outside too. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this restaurant! The food was delicious, great ambiance and friendly service. We came on a Friday night and the place was packed. I would recommend making reservations because we did have to wait awhile for a table. ( side note- there was no waiting on the patio but the patio is right in the middle of the foot traffic for the game at US Airways. While this is very downtown I feel like people are gawking at me while I eat. Or maybe I feel that way because I can't help myself from staring at other people to see what they are eating...)  We started out by ordering some drinks. I had the skinny raspberry mojito and my husband had the maid in mexico. Both drinks were really good. I loved my drink so much I vowed I would try to copy it and make it every day. Our service was very friendly and efficient and I felt like the staff knew the menu well. My husband ordered the grilled swordfish and I had the Friday night special the king crab cioppino.  The swordfish was cooked perfectly but the very best thing by far was the King crab cioppino. Our waiter said they almost always sell out of it on Fridays.  The broth was so delicious and it was loaded with scallops, king crab, mussels, some sort of pasta, and some other delicious seafood. It was a big enough portion that two people could easily split it. It comes with some bread so you could soak up the broth. If you come here on a Friday night I highly recommend you try the King crab cioppino."}
{"text":"OK if you like to wait for greasy food, and poor presentation."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but nothing really stood out to me on the menu when I visited. There wasn't a ton of variety. That said, the food quality is fine and the location is very convenient."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things. Every thing you've read in other reviews is true. Great service and sublime food.  We were a group of 8 and the waiter gave everyone equal attention. We ordered the fritters and the pretzel bites for appetizers. Both were great. The pretzel bites and cheese are addictive.  As an entree I ordered the short rib stew, and attached a pic of it. The rib meat was tender and tasty, and it had just the right amount of heat from the green chilis. Amazing cornbread too. Others ordered the fish and chips, and the sloppy joe; all were happy with their orders.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in town for a couple days with friends and came here for happy hour since it received great yelp reviews and a thumbs up from our hotel staff. We had a few of the happy hour cocktails- house white, the maid (was ok,  tasted like a margarita couldn't taste the cucumber at all and had way too much ice. It was literally 2 large swallows and gone) the fix (too sweet and again way to much ice) and the mule (served in a glass not the standard copper mug a mule should be in and was also just filled up with ice) none of the drinks seemed to have much alcohol so it may almost be better to skip happy hour drinks unless you're getting beer or wine. We had an app from the happy hour menu, house soft pretzels which they came out nice and warm but the provolone had no taste, just a cream sauce. Definitely  did not taste like provolone. For our meals I had a cheese and prosciutto board, the truffled crescenza cheese was really good, the prosciutto was just ok. I've had a lot of similar meat boards in NYC and Boston and this was not even comparable. Not good quality of meat and not enough for the $10 price (the crusty bread and mustard accompanying the dish was also a disappointment. I mean, who serves mustard with a prosciutto plate??) The bread was flavorless and too thickly cut for the small pieces of meat. I ordered a couple of the extras - prosciutto deviled eggs (awfully dry and flavorless) and roasted beets (honestly the best part of my meal). Two in my party had the cheeseburger they said were good, not great, and one of us had the crab legs which were ok but after she ate them she was still hungry so ordered a burger to go. The prize of the meal was the salted carmel pudding which the waitress told us won a couple awards in the city and it was delicious! All in all, we would probably not go back next trip, there are so many restaurants in the area. I also want to mention how lovely our waitress was, very friendly and attentive and answered all our questions. Great service here but the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was trendy, but very loud. We had difficulty hearing each other. Our server was fabulous, very attentive and helpful. We made reservations and the table was ready on time.   The food was excellent! I had the scallops with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes. It was beautiful and delicious. However, I was a bit disappointed on the portion size. The dish had 5 scallops and five small pieces of sweet potato.  The entree did not come with any bread, sides, or salad so 5 scallops was not much of a meal. But what was there was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the selection of food.  It is really close to Dbacks and Suns stadiums.  Staff are great, food is great.  Pick this one if you are downtown Phoenix.  or Jump on the rail for a special treat."}
{"text":"Salmon was salty, potatoes were somehow chewy and dry, green beans were undercooked and flavorless and I only received 4 small, dry mushroom pieces. For a $24 dish, I am VERY unhappy and dissatisfied. Clam chowder was good, boyfriends scallops were not bad. This restaurant is full of itself and pretends to be NYC hip. My guess is they spent too much on decor and didn't have enough in the budget for a decent chef, which is surprising based on their expensive dishes."}
{"text":"The menu was simple and the food outstanding.  Recommend the peanut butter mousse w chocolate gelato.  The meatloaf was excellent.  We also had a scratch made (everything here is) tomato saffron soup."}
{"text":"Awesome! Way cool atmosphere. Awesome food. Great service (although the waitress did call me \"kitten\"...weird). I got the sweet potato tortellini. Blew my mind. And the cheese and meats were delish."}
{"text":"Waiter was always forgetting things,atmosphere  fun. Food negative.Dont waste your money here"}
{"text":"Excellent menu and service. Wait staff very accommodating and seated us sooner because we waited inside."}
{"text":"Cool hot spot ready to explode!  I must give Mr. Fox some credit...he sure knows how to put together restaurant.  I love ABs for its flare and ambience.  I only had the AB Burger, but I tell ya; I looked around at everyone else's plate and was impressed.  Nice plating and delicious all around.  Next time I'm hitting the bar for some HH.  Service was delightful and informative...they're really on the ball.  The place itself has two identities. The front is your basic bar spot and eating area opened to the kitchen; love that!  The back is 2 private rooms with \"Edison-like\" lighting and \"Hollywood-like\" lounge seating.  Well placed and so is the restaurant.  Located in CityScape, but also diagonally across from the stadiums this place has the ability to really pop! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for the first time before a midweek Dbacks baseball game at Chase Field. Happy hour ends at 6pm, so I enjoyed two $5 mules after we were seated at 5:15pm. Great start. Absolutely loved the outstanding beef short rib green chile stew with the fried egg on top and the side of olives. The chopped salad was okay and the roasted peppers were bland. Received terrific service from Meagan and the rest of the staff. We made a reservation for 5:15pm and it was beneficial. I would advise others to call ahead and reserve."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and while I like the general atmosphere, the food and service have been hit or miss. The Arrogant Butcher has a snazzy name and an equally snazzy downtown location, and there's always a bit of a wait to get seated. I've noticed that the dining room isn't ever completely full, so the wait must be due to a mismatch between space and servers.   On my first visit, I came with a group of friends and we were seated outside. The service was superb, and our waiter was even nice enough to offer to roll down the plastic shade on the outside so the sunlight wouldn't be in our eyes. On my second visit, the service was lackluster and dismissive, to the point of being negligent. There was also a huge hair ball floating around the floor area I was sitting, which wasn't a pleasant sight during dining (I did think it was slightly funny that our waitress nonchalantly stepped over it multiple times).  Fish and chips: The first time I had this dish, I was blown away by the light crispiness of the fish and the freshness of the fries. The portion was generous, and I was so excited to try it again the second time. When I did recommend that my friend order this the second time and we shared, I found the fish to be super oily and the coating to be too thick. The fries were also limp and borderline cold.   Beef stew with cornbread: This stew was homey and comforting, especially when paired with the cornbread. The cornbread was lukewarm though, and that put a bit of a damper on the pairing. The seasoning is also on the spicy side, but the cornbread does a nice job of off-setting that.   Cheese ravioli: A pretty solid dish, but the portion is on the small side for the price. The ravioli was made well, and the sauce was nicely seasoned.   Turkey pastrami sandwich: I only had a bite of this on my first visit, but I thought the pastrami was pretty tasty. This is a hearty sandwich, and our server let us know that it was one of their most filling. Side salad can be substituted for the usual fries.  I may be back to the Arrogant Butcher, but the mixed experiences I've had make me a little wary."}
{"text":"A group of us ate here by recommendation and it did not disappoint! We were going to attend a basketball game and this was in a fantastic location (right across the street!). We ordered several dishes and a few that stood out were the butcher's platter and the scallops! I felt like it was a bit overpriced but it was a very busy restaurant and I can see it is a very popular place to go. I recommend it to others who are looking for a good place to eat! (Great ambiance too!)"}
{"text":"We've been coming to AZ for many years - stumbled into the Fox Restaurant within the last 5 years and have fallen in love with the quality.  We had never been here before and have already made it intended stop on our next visit!  Ian was an awesome server by the way...enjoyed chatting with him."}
{"text":"We had a nice long debate about whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars (from an account that has given 5 stars to pho places in the avenues). In the end, it came down to how well the restaurant met EXPECTATIONS.  If you have been to Tucson, for example. a very comparable restaurant is Hub. Similar atmospheres and rich, hearty, flavorful foods. But that place is in crappy Tucson so, pretty much having some edison bulbs down there scores you a 5 star review on the 'hip vibe' alone. But Arrogant Butcher is in downtown Phoenix and has nearly 300 reviews around 4 stars. One should EXPECT more than the typical Fox template.   The decor and service is excellent as expected.  However, the letdown came when, after enjoying the hummus plate and pretzel fondue, the angus cheeseburger came to the table. Good but so far below expectations. With all the other great items on the menu, they should have just axed the forgettable burger plate (or improve it to Zinburger status).   Also, be aware that they stop taking reservations 48 hours in advance. So, though our wait on a Saturday night was only about 15 minutes, you may want to plan ahead."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, Phoenix is the first city I've been to where yelp steered me wrong on almost all occasions. Arrogant Butcher fits that. We arrived on a Friday night, it was busy, understandably, so instead of waiting 45 minutes we sat at the bar.  Luckily there were menus at the seats because the bartender couldn't be bothered. He was obviously out of his element. We waited a good 8-10 minutes before he even \"greeted\" us. The greeting was, what do you want. Literally. That is what he said. This dude had no business being behind the bar, he was a dick, flat out. Other customers got the same treatment. Maybe he was a fill in for someone who called out, but there should have been 2 bartenders doing service drinks and taking care of the bar guests. I asked for an IPA his response \"which one\", aggressively, like I was an inconvenience to him and his poor bartending skills.  We ordered food, my colleague ordered a salad and I the burger. The burger was meh at best. The patty had zero flavor and really all I tasted was whatever mustard style sauce they had on it. The fries were good, I'll say that. Of course our jolly bartender never checked in only when both our drinks were empty and food done.  Maybe table service is better, maybe the entrees are better, but I'd skip this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Went there today with my four-year-old granddaughter, step granddaughter and daughter-in-law for lunch after having gone to the circus.  I had the beef short rib stew; she had the pork carnitas; the girls had the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich with added bacon from the children's menu.    I tried the grilled cheese sandwich with the bacon.    Yes, it was good.    I didn't try the mac and cheese.   I tried the pork, and that was good.   What I had was delish.   It had enough chili in it to make it a little spicy, which I like.    I think without it, it would have been rather bland.   It came with cornbread, and yes, quite tasty as well.   The restaurant is part of the Fox family of restaurants.   Therefore, would it be anything other than good.   Every one of their restaurants I've tried is good.    Would I go there again?    Yes.    I don't know if there are any other locations besides the one downtown, but I'd go."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Fox restaurant concepts and the Culinary Dropout, then this place is for you! I've never had a bad dish here. Their soups, salads and entrees are all spectacular. All of the flavors of their dishes are married beautifully and every bite you take will dance in your mouth. Pure happiness! You won't go wrong with any of their signature drinks. Their only downfall is there is always a long wait so make sure you plan accordingly especially during large downtown events."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was just mehhh.   We split  the soft pretzels and fondue, which are the exact same as every other Fox concept restaurant that serves them. The candle attempting to keep the cheese warm doesn't do a sufficient job.  The BLT I had was alright - a little too much lettuce and I wasn't particularly fond of the bread it was on.   On a more positive note, the place was completely dead, so service was quick and both servers were really pleasant."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious. Great food, awesome atmosphere. Great for celebrations or a date night."}
{"text":"I'll admit. I like FRC. I also like that you can get a pretty good discount by buying some gift cards for yourself at Costco. Hah.   The mussels - are really really great. My husband who claims he does not like seafood (but whose favorite foods include salmon, scallops, and ahi tuna..... yeah) loved the mussels. I may or may not have had an incident involving a flying piece of corn cob.... I just can't eat it from the cob!!!   We ordered the jambalaya and short ribs. We usually order 2 different dishes and split them. We basically fought over the short ribs like little children. It was really great.   I highly recommend TAB, as well as *most* FRC restaurants. We will be back. With our Costco gift cards, too. Don't judge me!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The Filet mignon and Salted Caramel Pudding was worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious and fun environment in a great location. Very reasonably priced with great dessert."}
{"text":"Best service! This place was pretty hip. Food was fresh, perfectly seasoned and delicious. Best part was the dessert. Loved it! Recommended leaving room for dessert Salted Carmel and Hot Cocoa cake was Spectacular."}
{"text":"I was one of the hosts of a private event here and the food was fantastic! I had the sweet potato tagtelle and the salted caramel pudding, both delicious and would definitely order again on my own dime. Service was great and atmosphere was lively and comfortable. My only real complaint is the noise level. My guests all complained that they shouted at each other all night. But it was still a great event!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has received four stars. In my recent visit, I order buffalo chicken tenderloin appetizer. It was so fatty, I spent most of the time cutting away the fat. My guest took a whole one and ate it without inspection. The look on his face indicated to me that he felt the same way. When I asked, he said \"Not the best I've ever had and almost comes across a little vinegar flavor to the sauce.\"  My salmon kale salad was alright. Not the best I've ever had.  The ice too was good though and the service was decent.  When we exited I said, \"Well that's one I can mark off my list.\" My guest concurred. Maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 8:00 on a Saturday for 10 for my wife's birthday.  It was busy when we arrived but nothing out of the ordinary for Saturday night.  We waited for almost an hour to be seated while the staff kept saying the group before us was here for almost 2 1/2 hours and that's why we weren't being seated.  The entire time we stood at the front door we watched the back room where there were two sections of tables with seating for 10-12 each which were fully set and nobody was at the tables.  We asked several times if we could be seated there and were told yes those were our seats but they couldn't find anyone to seat us.......um why can't one of you who keeps saying we can't find anyone to seat you?  When we were finally seated the gentlemen walked us half way to the back and then pointed and said those seats on the left our for you.  Thanks for making us wait 45 minutes for that.  Our drink orders took almost another 45 minutes to arrive and when they started one person at the table received their drink twice and the rest of us were still waiting.  The table next to us who sat down after us was so fed up they started walking up to the bar and were able to get their drinks before our table was served!    When the food finally arrived around 10:30 it was horrible and outside of the steak and meatloaf ordered everyone at the table was disappointed.  Needless to say my wife was unhappy we chose this place for her birthday and would never want to return."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious carnitas nachos! First time at the restaurant. Sat at the bar. Good service friendly and lively atmosphere prior to the Suns game. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! My boyfriend and i have dubbed this place our \"Sunday Spot\" for a number of different reason.   My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar, so of course i could start by saying they have an excellent drink menu. They have specialty cocktails that are all carefully hand crafted and delicious. I am more of a wine drinker, and the wine list is perfect for anyone with a sophisticated pallet. My boyfriend has a little less knowledge about wine and the bartender took the time to help him to find a wine that he would like. Brent is another reason we come to this place. He is an amazing bartender and incredibly knowledgeable and skilled at his craft.   Moving along to the food. I have yet to order something here that I have not enjoyed. Everything had been so tasty!! If you're in the mood for some comfort food you have to try the meatloaf. It is so delicious and the portion is perfect. If you have decided on wine with dinner, I would recommend trying the cheese board. It was fantastic and a little different then ones I have had before in the best way. Even the dessert is amazing.   I have nothing bad to say about this place and we both have told multiple people about it and have suggested to our bosses that it is a great place to go for a business lunch. Do yourself a favor and try this place. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"We were in town for lunch and decided to try this place. It was busy on a Saturday for brunch but only had to wait about 15 minutes. Our server was very friendly and I loved my food. I got the turkey pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and swiss on a pretzel bun and a side salad. It was all delicious. I wish I had the recipe for the champagne vinaigrette that was on the salad. It was cold in the air conditioned back room but it's probably just how the place is laid out."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night before a comedy show at Citycenter, and the place was packed already at 6pm.  Sat at the benches that overlooked the open kitchen.  Kinda cool and the staff did a great job getting the food out fast.  Atmosphere was modern and present, similar to other Sam Fox restaurants.  Food was good, had the scallops, but for the price the portion was on the small side."}
{"text":"Two words...sloppy joes! Ok, two more PB cup!  Loved the lunch here. They have all my favorites! The turkey sloppy joes were delish! I miss this childhood classic.  The desserts rock too. We had the salted caramel pudding and peanut butter cup. My taste buds were thinking of salted caramel gelato when I took a bite but the pudding was not as savory or salty. Still good but could use some umph. Loved the creamy PB cup!!  Every dish looks great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to AB.  Nice decor and friendly staff.  The weather was nice so we sat outside.  I had the turkey pastrami sandwich with a side of cole slaw.  It made for a great lunch.  I'd like to stop in here again when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Avoid during concerts/events. We went here for drinks & dinner before the concert and had reservations and were seated quickly, that's when the disapointment started to kick in. Our server was nice and attentive however it took forever to get anything as the bar and kitchen were backed up. It was clear they weren't staffed appropriately to handle a full house even though they knew this concert was on the calendar MONTHS AGO! On top of that they don't provide you with their full menu on event nights and you are pretty much left with a majority of it being seafood choices which nearly all in our party don't eat. Not sure why you take simple things off the menu that everyone enjoys and can be prepared quickly and instead keep complex dishes that take longer to prepare when you know you are going to have a full house and timing and throughput are key. Drinks took about 15 minutes to get after ordering and food much longer. Suffice to say the majority of us just had drinks and picked up some greasy food at the arena which was more appealing than what this place had on their menu. It's a pity as I've been here before on non-event nights with a full menu and under those circumstances would give them 3.5 stars. Definitely a Jekyl & Hdye inconsistent offering and service type place, beware on event nights."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix on a business trip and gave this a chance based on the Yelp! reviews. I can confirm that this place is very good. Coworker and I both had steaks (NY strip for me, filet mignon for her). They were both cooked perfectly, our waitress was awesome, and I will let everyone at my job know to stop by this place if they are here for a visit."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good service, good filet, shrimp sucked.  Didn't live up to the hype for me, but I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Great lunch on the patio (in May) with great friends.   Just a note...be sure to know your parking options before you go downtown. There is close parking for this venue."}
{"text":"We came I Arrogant Butcher this evening with a friend who has been before and wow! This place does not dissapoint! All of the staff are very friendly and on point with everything from the greeting to the goodbye. But let's honestly get down to why we go. The food. I can honestly say that tonight's meal was one of my favorites I have ever ate! I enjoyed to chicken and crab and it was cooked perfectly and was a great portion for the price. It's been a very long time I have done appetizers, entree and desserts, but this restaurant made our night with all three!"}
{"text":"I had the honor of hanging out with three lovely ladies after stopping at Filmbar for a happy hour. We were STARVING so I looked up restaurants close by and The Arrogant Butcher was agreed on by all parties. After wandering aimlessly for parking (damn you Phoenix Suns for having a game) I was able to secure a parking spot and sashayed on over for some eats.   We were greeted and seated immediately. The decor I must say is very different but nice. I was fascinated by their lamp shades. ( I know silly but hey I was) We started out with the crusty bread and olive oil however we had no plates, but we dug in anyway (an let me just say this was some damn good bread) Our waitress was like hmm would you guys like some plates for your bread? Hmm yes please ( ya think) lol  We all ordered something different from the sweet potato tortelli, yum, the turkey sloppy joe, which had a slight kick but not as spicy as you would think, fish and chips, and of course my dish which was black mussels with pommes frites. OMG! My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived. It had the most mussels I have have ever had and the fries were just perfect. There were even bits of pork shoulder as well as cloves of garlic throughout the dish. Sweet baby jesus. Now mind you I was full, but I ate every last bit as it was not like I could take any left overs home. I liked it so much that I am contemplating going back ASAP just to have some more, so yes it was that good. A word to the wise, if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4.00. A very small portion. (that is all)  The service was good, the company was freaking fabulous and the food was divine. They even validate parking (thank goodness) so it made it all the better. An all around win in my book."}
{"text":"The food was not good for the price you pay. Everything was bland tasting. It all looked good on the plates, but the taste was just not there."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the arrogant butcher before a Suns game. It was great!  First of all the atmosphere was great.  We started with spinach and artichoke dip which was fantastic. I had the salmon and my friend had the fish tacos. We are outside and it was the perfect day for eating outdoors.  We both enjoyed our entrees. I will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"Logan & Brittney were extremely helpful!!! Fantastic service, excellent quality, everything cooked to perfection! You know how picky i am and how much I love my scallops! They were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Decent on just about every front.  Convenient location for suns games and events. Don't have high expectations for the food though."}
{"text":"It was our first time to go to the Arrogant Butcher. The food was good and the prices were reasonable for the location. Our server was friendly and diligent. The atmosphere was relaxing and the noise level was comfortable enough where we didn't feel like we had to raise our voice to have a conversation. It was great choice for our date night.   I had the prime rib (medium) with potato au gratin. The prime rib had a pleasant smokey flavor as they use their smoker to hold their prime ribs at temp after they are finished in the oven.   My wife had the diver scallops on a bed of wilted spinach (substituted from cream corn). They were perfectly cooked and buttery tasting."}
{"text":"Had a great visit here with some friends- the staff were awesome, the food tasty and the beer COLD- how can you go wrong?  There is lots to choose from on the menu, were ordered several appetizers just to share, all good. Short Rib Stew was great!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Arrogant Butcher and I know it will not be my last. Excellent food and perfect service. Thank you, Brent, for taking such great care my friend and me.  The scallops were (wait for it) perfect!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Overpriced. Overrated. Snobbish service.  Typical Fox concepts. Elitist/Hipster employees.   Unimpressed."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Had a birthday lunch with coworkers and it was a great experience. The food is similar to the other Fox Restaurants, but has enough variety that I don't feel as though I'm sitting at Culinary Dropout again.  Service was great for a busy lunch rush and I will likely be going back."}
{"text":"Incredible ambiance, food choices plentiful!  Had the Slow roasted prime rib ajou--wow!   Horseradish infused potatoes--divine!  Prime rib was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great meal, excellent staff, amazing ambiance!  Another Fox success.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS!  had dinner here last night with my boyfriend and it was amazing.  Cheese fondue and pretzel rolls are a must!!! had some cheese and meats that we picked at and we shared an entree.  The steak was really good. perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed the horseradish cream sauce that came with it.  Even the seasonal veggies that I normally just pick and and leave were really good."}
{"text":"I ate at one of Sam's first restaurants in Tucson call Gilligans when I found out he was here in Phoenix I decided to try some of his new concepts. We were downtown and I saw that Arrogant Butcher a Fox restaurant was in the area so we decided to give it a try. We started with the Carnitas nachos with white beans which was a surprisingly tasty and filling appetizer. For lunch I had the prime rib French dip sandwich which was quite tasty a bit pricey but what do you expect for the downtown area. I will definitely try some of his other restaurants and plan to come back for a few other items that I saw on the menu like I would want to try the Salumi as well as some other cheese plates and other appetizers."}
{"text":"Great vibe.   Awesome service!   We had drinks and appetizers. The drinks were very tasty and unique.   We will come back."}
{"text":"Busy on a Sunday at 4:45pm. It took about 20 minutes to get seated then served the food. Our waitress was very sweet. I enjoyed my bbq chicken dish and all the sides that came with it. My hub liked his tasty rib steak stew. Large place with very cute clean restrooms.   Glad I made a Rez for after the Opera."}
{"text":"Traveled the light rail downtown to go to fuego. Fuego was closed despite our reservations we made, so we ended up at arrogant butcher. It had been a restaurant i wanted to try. We got sat at the bar area by the kitchen and it was awesome getting to watch the kitchen in action! zucchini fritters were amazing with the parmesan aioli! I got the short rib stew. Cornbread was light and fluffy with a buttery taste. The stew itself had a fried egg on top and was quite spicy. A little too spicy but it had great flavor. My friend got the sweet potato tortelli. the butter sauce was rich and the pasta sweet. The peanut butter cup was a warm peanut butter mousse with chocolate gelato and 2 cookies. The warm chocolate cake was a little dry and not very sweet. just okay. All around thought, i thought the meal was very good and i would go back!"}
{"text":"Ask for Chip ... it's really like going to Disneyland, except it's restaurant.  Great, knowledgable service, good food ... fun times."}
{"text":"Service, service, followed by amazing service.  Here's the scoop.  Arrived Saturday night to a 60 minute wait for a table. Wife did some magic wifey stuff and all of a sudden we were seated at the chef's table on the side where salads and apps are created.  We sat down, and were greeted, immediately by a server with amazing energy and passion for his work.  Efficiently he took our drink orders, made recommendations, and went to acquire the goods.  Next, an equally energetic line cook welcomed us to the restaurant and asked if this was a repeat visit.  No we advised.  He truly beamed with excitement and welcomed us, telling us about how excited he was to have us and started offering us what I expected to be small samples.  At this point, I felt like they thought we were actually important.  As though we were famous, knew someone in their corporate office, etc.  BTW - were just normies.  Wife asked for an off the menu item due to food allergies.  Did they respond?  Yes!!!!  I was able to watch the employee hand cut a head of lettuce, grill it for a moment, hand slice chicken.  He then confirms what the allergens are and asks if he can add more to the salad to make it better for my wife!  He then turns to a line cook to coordinate the timing of the delivery of our food.  I am soooo impressed at this point.  Everyone was getting along, no egos were bruised as the staff (tactfully) hollered to their peers, what they needed.  It was amazing to see the true team work and the fun being had!    Salad - perfect 10.  Turkey Sloppy Joe - 9, just a bit sweet.  Portion of fries served with Sloppy Joe, enough for (4) four adults.    Overall experience?  11 out of 10!  (Or 5/7 for my Imgur peeps).   One the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Made my last $250 dinner at Dominicks feel like a dinner at Chillis.  Two entrees, one draft, one soft drink - including tax, title, license, and docs fees - $40."}
{"text":"We waited about 20 minutes at the table and no one would help us but one did was the shining light, Cody. He was so sorry about the wait and we felt relieved! :) He was so outstanding and gave us a discount for the food too! The food and Cody were excellent! Btw, the waitress who has tattoos all over her body could help us but she didn't WANT TO- we were mad and almost leave the restaurant but he saved it... thank him."}
{"text":"Overall this was very good.  Service was friendly and fast.  The menu has some unique and interesting items, in particular some of the cheese plates were really great.  The pretzel dip appetizer was really awesome."}
{"text":"Although I usually like the food there, last night episode was really bad!  I ordered the Jambalaya and after eating a few bites, found a one inch long metal wire in it.  The manager replace the dish very rapidly for the same. Not sure if I will be able to go back there with that experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a really fun environment along with the staff who is professional and friendly. The food is creative and tastes so good. My favorite is the pretzel appetizer, but I was happy with all of my food. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a cool energetic place to eat downtown."}
{"text":"Only had the Chefs Choice Charcuterie, but it was absolutely amazing!  The device seriously rocked!!!"}
{"text":"Okay my wife and I visited last night sans kids for an adult dinner with drinks.  Started with an old fashioned which was pretty good even though I prefer mine a little less sweet.  My wife and I settled on oysters and shrimp for the starter.  The oysters were as fresh as if we were actually somewhere off the east coast where they came from off Long Island.  The giant prawn were great and meaty.  Fresh horse radish and separate cocktail sauce was nice but they added this third sauce that was supper tasty as well and I couldn't put my finger on it but it was delicious.  Finally for dinner my wife chose the scallops and I chose the jambalaya.  My server helped me navigate as I couldn't decide between that and the braised short rib stew.  But since I told him I was starving and preferred a larger dish we went with it.  Next time I'll try the stew.  The scallops were perfect.  The server actually told us the chef vetoed the first batch as they were slightly over cooked which takes me to the three ***.  Before that my jambalaya was super flavorful.  He advised it was 8 of 10 on heat index and I would put it about 6 but I have higher tolerance than many.  Okay the 3 stars is because it took sooooo long, 30 minutes, to get raw oysters and cold shrimp.  Granted the manager advised the seafood guy had to shuck 80 oysters.  Next it took forever to get the entrees which above I said the server advised that the scallops had to be redone.  This was what appeared to be an average Saturday night.  The wait was about 5 minutes although we had reservations.    Lastly our server was top notch.  Knew the menu cold and had great descriptions about and opinions of every dish.  This guys has to be one of their best.  I was a little disappointed when the restaurant forgave nearly half the menu of the couple next to us for their inconvenience but didn't even offer us a free dessert.  I guess not complaining and being pleasant has its limitations as it appeared the server and manager recognized the delayed service therefore no need to chatter about it or complain.  Squeaky wheel gets the grease!  Regardless we will be back.  Great food,  good atmosphere and hopefully the kitchen will be more organized next time."}
{"text":"Nice, good service, AND CHEESE!!! Variety of fine cheeses = amazing. Like all Fox Concepts, unique food and cocktail selections. I'd go again... and I'm a vegetarian."}
{"text":"We ate at this place last week. Food was very good.  Weather was great for their patio. What really made this a great experience was our waitress.  Elecka (not sure if spelled correctly) was so good and so friendly.  Made good suggestions and so attentive."}
{"text":"My friend and I went into the Arrogant Butcher because the pizza place down the street had closed at 1:40 pm for lunch. It ended up being a happy instance. We wandered a block down into The Arrogant Butcher.  This place looks great! The ambiance is comfortable and the hostess greets you immediately. The staff is dressed in what I would imagine a butcher would wear under his smock, Dark pants, white shirt, suspenders, looking very trendy and sharp.  We opted to sit at the bar, he had a hamburger, I had their cubano. It was delicious, and the portions weren't too much or too little. The bartender was friendly enough, and march madness was on the television.   There was nothing that really made this place amazing, but it was really good. We met some great folks, and had a great time chatting it up with them!   If I found myself in the downtown area again, I would gladly re-visit the Arrogant Butcher."}
{"text":"Really delicious menu. My three highlights and two areas for improvement are below.   1. THE PRETZEL BITES WITH PROVOLONE FONDUE. there's really nothing else to say. Do it.  2. The loaded nachos were really loaded. There is delicious guacamole, beans, a scrumptious cheese sauce, and much more. We licked this plate clean!  3. The seating- there is a cool room in the back corner, a large square bar surrounded by tvs on each side. Also had community tables where 12 people can sit, first come, first serve. This is my favorite type of seating and it was great!  The rest of the food was also salivating (shout out to the tacos). But two things keep this place from being a five star rating. First, it's a bit pricey. Food was good, but each entree item was over $20 (except for the fish tacos. Hence why I got them). Second, the special margarita was very sugary and did not have much alcohol. I'm not the biggest fan of spending $11 for juice."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of twenty and the team was great! Shout out to Tiffany especially :) they were kind, polite, and efficient. And best of all - calm!   Food was excellent from appetizers to desserts. Particularly recommend scallops."}
{"text":"Saturday was a ladies night out. So as I meet up with the girls glacing across the street I see this cute, fun looking place called Arrogant Butcher.    Upon walking in a group of ladies all at once asked us if we would likevtoo be seated, feeling overwhelmed I said Yes.... she walked us to our table.   I was starving and I already knew what I wanted.  Our waitress was tall as a stripper pole a killer smile with Ruby red lipstick.....  She rattled of some drinks specials in honor of Prince which I thought was a great idea.   I ordered the sea bass. Delicious!!!! It  was moist and flaky with a bed of amazing creaminess covering the bottom. I had no clue what is was but boy did it taste good.   My girlfriends had the jambalaya. It was the biggest bowl I had ever seen and it taste like you were transported to New Orleans. BEADS PLEASE.....  It had big chucks of shrimp, chiicken and sausage. I could'nt help sticking my fork in their bowls to get more. It was so good with the hint of heat at the end of each bite.  Yessss! Am I on Bourbon Street...  We decided to get extra greedy and order the hot chocolate cake with whipped cream.... have I lost my mind? MAYBE...but I was worth it.   Better get there early on Saturdays around 4pm for dinner. This place gets crowded pretty fast.   When Im in the downtown phoenix area I will make it my business to have round two at this special place."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner tonight at our leisure. We were sat immediately and had a couple minutes to peruse the drink menu before someone stopped by. The boys had beer in a bottle, I ordered the Pink Drink. A little skeptical but it was delicious. After reviewing the menu we decided on pretzels and fondue to start, 6 shrimp from the raw bar (delicious) and 2 NY steaks cooked medium and a stuffed chicken.  The NY steaks came out Med-well to well. Good flavor but charred and cooked more than we liked. The stuffed chicken had a strong lemon flavor but lacked in other substance and the cooked spinach left him hungry. We went back for 9 more shrimp from the raw bar to wrap up our meal. Service is unreliable, hard to find. Pleasant when you can find them. Not sure we would come back here for dinner."}
{"text":"4/2/13: Dinner with a large group of coworkers, I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich served with coleslaw. Bread really tasted salty almost pretzel like but otherwise well made. Excellent location if you're either headed to see a baseball or basketball game."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great atmosphere, and even better food. Had the Carnitas Nachos as an appetizer which were amazing. Huge portions, great for sharing. The Jambalaya was also amazing! 5/5"}
{"text":"I have never had the kind of amazing food like the food I had at the Arrogant Butcher!!!  Not only is it very trendy and fun, but it is also just a great place for hanging out!    I order the pretzel bun sandwhich...have never had anything like that before I tried and it was out of this world.  It was one of the best dining experiences I had in a long time.  Everything was fabulous from the experience to the staff.    They also had wonderful cocktails and the happy hour was decent as well!    Highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Ate here before Dbacks Opening day, menu was very limited (we went for Fish&Chips or a Cheeseburger & neither were on the menu). For appetizers had the nachos- huge & good, pretzels & cheese- SO bland, needed spicd or really anything more. Had meatloaf which was ok (mashed potatoes & green beans were divine though!) enjoyed the hot chocolate cake but it needed ice cream or something- very dry with out. Overall- service was quick & great but food was Ok, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"When I walked into the restaurant I stood there for well over a few minutes while the hostess carried on a conversation. Finally one of them stepped away, and I still kind of stood there waiting on a acknowledgment from the other young girl. After realizing she carried on with a lot of busy work I approached her and asked is this a seat your self restraint or do I need to continue waiting to be seated. She apologized for not realizing that I was waiting to be seated (how she didn't realize that is unknown to be since she was the hostess). She told me that there was a fifteen minute wait unless I wanted to set at the bar. I seated myself at the bar, and the bartender ended asked if I had been here before and of course I said that I have not. She brought over the menu, and left. Waiting, waiting, and more waiting. I thought well maybe she  doesn't realize I'm done looking  at the menu. Literally I started me stop watch 8 minutes and 53 seconds go by before she comes back, and the almost 9 minute wait before I actually turned on the stop watch who knows before then how long it actually was long enough to actually started timing. FOOD A MAXING. I have the NY Steak and it was delicious, but the service is HORRIBLE. Had it not be for the steak I would have given this place a 1 maybe 2"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and ordered the chopped salmon salad - delicious! The salad is pretty large (and rightfully so for $13) but I managed to eat every last bit. Plenty of chunks of salmon on a bed of kale.  I'd recommend making a reservation - at 12:30p it was packed!"}
{"text":"In town for a convention and heard good things. The food was excellent. The service was a little slower than expected, but it was quite busy because there was a Suns game that night as well and the arena is adjacent to the restaurant.  Overall, I would recommend trying it out...I would return when I come back to Phoenix or lives nearby."}
{"text":"This is a downtown Phoenix must! Fun, creative appetizers including house made soft pretzel bites with cheese fondue or zucchini fritters, excellent cheese or charcuterie plates, simple or sophisticated salad choices, and excellent entrees with nightly down head me style specials. Right off Jefferson St near Chase Field, so great before and after a game. Oh yes, dessert game is on point too! Use Open Table or otherwise reserve a head, busy busy spot - but worth it! As name would imply it's a protein palace, but more than enough meatless options to keep all happy."}
{"text":"Ate at the Arrogant Butcher for dinner. Service was excellent.  However, it too so long to get our drinks we were done with dinner.  Had their famous salted carmel pudding - yuck.  Waited 10 minutes for a cold premaid dessert that was so salty we couldn't eat it. Thank goodness the whip cream was good.  Overall a good dinner but expect more for the price."}
{"text":"The 4  rating is for the Butcher's antipasti platter, which for $23.00 for the tray, really hit the right spots.   A 3+ for the Saturday special, the 14 ounce prime rib. The horseradish I believe was in the scalloped potatoes which accompanied the prime rib. The beef itself was not herb crusted enough for my own personal taste. It didn't have any richness or depth to its flavor. The salty au jus didn't help.   3  for the seafood soup   3  for some serving faux pas, such as bringing out our main entrees while we barely got our antipasti for our appetizer. Because of this, our prime rib dinner was quite cold by the time we started digging into it. Secondly, being given butter knives to cut our prime rib with, made it a tough ordeal just to try to slice off a small piece. We did get steak knives as soon as we requested them.   4 1/2  for the decor and the ambiance.   I'm continuing on with my search for the holy grail   prime rib dinner."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was absolutely delicious!!!  It was cooked just right (I ordered medium to medium-rare) and was so entirely tasty! The veggies were really good too!   Last night I got the kids burger and that was totally good too.   I have two more days here and I think I'm going to eat as much meat from the Arrogant Butcher as I can.  Oh yeah, baby!  Also, I totally love the vibe here.  Good music and decor. The cooks look like they have fun. And the servers are hot."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good ---- we went with 5 people, and everyone enjoyed what they had, from the stew, to stroganoff, to salmon, which I had.  We started with the suggested (by waiter) appetizer of pretzels and cheese, and it was a nice start for one order to pass around the table.  We all had salads which we enjoyed, and we must say something about the caramel pudding dessert.  Very good.  Parking was easy (one of us parked on the street, the other in the garage and used validation) and food was good.  However, the two negatives are a bit of a limited menu, and pretty pricey for what we had.  I like a restaurant that doesn't overfeed you, and this one did not ---- but it was on the expensive side for the amount of food we did get.  But then we were in downtown Phoenix (we are usually on the outskirts) so it is probably comparable to other restaurants in the area.  We would go here again."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Service was a little confusing. Didn't really know who our real server was but other than that, everyone was friendly. The food was fantastic. The Nachos were amazing and so was the butchers platter. Definitely will go again, next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Got a few appetizers including the pretzel fondue, artichoke hummus and zucchini fritters. The pretzel fondue is what dreams are made of...seriously.  Drinks were well crafted and worth the higher price! Hummus was a bit disappointing but everything else was ah-mazing!!!"}
{"text":"Was at the Arrogant Butcher meeting up for happy hour with fellow Yelpers for the CMYE: Opening Night of Giselle and I have never been here before but had researched the reviews and knew right away I wanted to try the Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue, it seems Yelpers can't help by to Yelp about them, and let me tell you, OOOMMMGGG believe everything you read about them, they are soft yet firm bites (more like 2 or 3 bites) of balled up pretzel dough with the right amount of salt that gets to be dunked in this heavenly pot of provolone fondue, yes this is a perfect dish!   Ok enough of them, everyone talks about them, now onto other things I tried. The artichoke hummus with olives & tomatoes and flatbread, yes that was good, was it memorable, no, it was ok.  Also tried the chicken liver pate with pickled onions toast, my friend ordered these because she wanted to try it, I was game, my 1st bite was great, the red pickled onions and the pate mixed together was a perfect blend, but the 2nd bite, that's where it turned way too salty for me to enjoy.   Now the local ricotta & roasted peppers toast was so delish! It was toasted perfectly, the ricotta & peppers with balsamic vinegar was omg cosmic, was very very sad when it had disappeared!   Yep I think the next time I am their I am just getting the pretzel fondue & ricotta & roasted peppers toast haha oh and I heard The Fix is the drink to get!"}
{"text":"Slow Service and not much food selection. We came in around 1pm for a reservation and Its Almost 2pm and our food hasnt arrived yet. Kids meal is not in the Menu so you have to ask for a verbal kids Menu. And still not much selection..."}
{"text":"I had the mussels and chopped salad.   Mussels good not spectacular  chopped salad didn't arrive \" chopped\" but nonetheless very tasty. champagne vinaigrette dressing was the star   No desert but had the pretzel fondue. Not worth the calories  Good vibe but perhaps I'm too old to embrace the ambient noise and chatter"}
{"text":"The prime rib, hot chocolate cake and zucchini appetizer were all good. Nothing amazing but solid and tasty. My only real disappointment was the hostess and wait. When I make a reservation I expect it to be honored my reservation was for 6:15pm and we were not seated until 7:05pm. The hostess was rude and although the manager comped a couple appetizers the whole situation soured the evening.   Be weary. They had difficulty honoring a number of groups reservations."}
{"text":"Came here for a work celebration for a project we have been slaving over for months.  Finally back to a normal working hours, no more 80+ hours a week.    We were in the private room in the back.  We had champagne and apps already out for us. We had a set list of items to order from.  I got the turkey pastrami.  YUM!  Pretzel bread anything is good.  Blueberry cheesecake is to die for!   The service was good considering we had 25+ of us.  I did had to ask a few times for refills."}
{"text":"Just based on the name, I wouldn't have come here - I'm vegetarian. But we had a work event here, so there wasn't much I could do. It was a prefixed menu, and I was delightfully surprised to find a vegetarian option! Just for the record, this is the only vegetarian entree on the menu.   Dinner started out with a Simple Chopped Salad. This was your standard chopped salad with a light and fruity dressing. I ordered the Sweet Potato Tortelli for my entree, and I was absolutely blown away!! It was sweet, savory, and so flavorful! In fact, everyone sitting around me wanted to taste it because it smelled so good. I wanted some type of bread on the side, and the server brought me toasted bread with balsamic vinegar. For dessert, I had the Blueberry Cheesecake and it was the perfect ending to my meal. The crumble on top was crunchy, and the cheesecake was the perfect sweetness. I did taste the Salted Carmel Pudding and it was delicious as well. Personally too sweet for me, but delicious none the less. I loved how the desserts were served in individual mason jars.   The service was great, and I would definitely recommend hosting an events here. The staff was very attentive and the party room felt like it was part of the restaurant but secluded at the same time. Overall, I give this place 4 stars only because there is no vegetarian variety. The service was great too. My coworkers enjoyed the place and said they would return."}
{"text":"Loved the place!!! Loved our food!  Appetizers (pretzel/cheese fondue and salami/cheese) were awesome.  Filet, jambalaya and crab leg dinners amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience this week with our large party along with all the prom couples that came in. Apps and mains were all delicious - no complaints what so ever. Though very busy, the service was excellent!  Had the seafood linguini and it was tasty!"}
{"text":"My family stopped in here after a visit to the Arizona Science Museum on a weekday, early afternoon.  Our group ranged in age from 4 to 65 and included 2 kids and 3 adults.  There is a kids menu although it is not written down.  The kids menu includes mac and cheese, chicken fingers, cheeseburger, and one other item.  The server offered to put our kids' orders in right away (2 mac n cheese), which we greatly appreciated.  That dish was tasty enough for adults and kids alike.  It would have been even better if it had come with a small serving of fruit or veggies for a more balanced meal.    The 3 adults in our party shared the prosciutto appetizer, which also included some sliced bread and delicious sweet mustard concoction that i had never before tasted.  Yummy.  For mains we chose the turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun and side salad, chinese salad, and sweet potato tortelli.  The tortelli portion was a little small. But there wasn't much conversation after our food arrived because we were all enjoying our lunch too much to talk.  For dessert we shared the blueberry cheesecake, which featured crumbles on top.  1 was definitely not enough for our group, particularly because the kids loved it!  Fun ambience, good service, great food.  Thank you, downtown phoenix!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out the Arrogant Butcher last night.  I was not sure what to expect  but we are very glad we went.  The restaurant was busy but not slammed.  We made our reservation for 6:00 and were seated right away.  Our waitress was Amanda and she was out of this world!  She knew the menu (answered all our questions as we were debating on what to get/offered suggestions). Her service was spot on!    We started off with Potato Fritters which were delicious.  And for our main course we had the special Italian Seafood Stew and the Bolognese off the menu.  Both were outstanding!   The Italian Seafood Stew was a tomato based broth, King crab, Mussels, Swordfish, Halibut and a little bit of pasta.    We did not feel it was expensive and would come back again.  This is my favorite Fox restaurant.  I have dined at Zinburger, Olive and Ivy, True Foods and Culinary Dropout.   My only negative which I shared with the Manager was the lack of signage.  We parked in the garage below CityScape and had to walk all around.  With the construction on Jefferson it was really hard to see the \"A\".  The Arrogant Butcher is located on the southeast side of City Scape near US Airways."}
{"text":"Start with the pretzels.  Pastrami sandwich is outstanding."}
{"text":"went for breakfast and and although the selection was a bit limited, the food was great.  i had the cajun breakfast burrito and french toast; of which both were amazing.  service was friendly, and loved the atmosphere.  i have yet to try lunch or dinner so cant give 5 stars just yet.  too bad they are not open for sunday brunch....they might just give Local Breeze some competition if they did."}
{"text":"Eh wasn't impressed really. I mean it's a nice place and downtown City Scape is a pretty cool area to hang out in but the restaurant itself offered mediocre food to be honest. I probably wouldn't go back here. Lots of other options in the area"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time on a Thu. Night. I ordered the daily special of fried chicken which was fantastic. My wife ordered the scallops which were great too? We both sampled some cool different beers.   Overall great experience.  Parking was right around the corner and they validate.  If your going downtown I highly recommend the arrogant butcher.  Great inexpensive place with high energy super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, prices are reasonable, drinks are poured perfectly and service is great, even though they are always busy! Have been back numerous times and will continue to enjoy this establishment."}
{"text":"Friday night HAPPY HOUR and we were HAPPY! $4 Mules (ginger lime, yum!) and $4 basket (yes, BASKET!) of pretzel bites with provalone fondue. DEElish. Market Salad was fantastic. Fresh ricotta, grilled corn and just the right amount of dressing. Turkey Pastrami on Pretzel Bread was a great as well, but a bit small for $12. Service was excellent. He advised us on parking, gave us plenty of time between apps and the main meal and even managed to get me an extra drink for the Happy Hour price (it was 15min. past 6pm). Overall, a great experience. We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of state, and had a great experience . Our server was very attentive, and the food came quickly,  and it was very good. Wide variety of food on the menu. My husband and I split a ' Charcuterie' pictured here. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Chicken thigh appetizer was ok. Not what I expected, too much breading for my liking."}
{"text":"Celeste was our server and she was an absolute joy! From the moment we sat down to the very end, it was awesome. The food is fresh, super delicious and melt in your mouth- YUM! If I lived in Phoenix,  would totally come back for another date. I can see why this place is around and it's def not going anywhere. The pretzel and fondue was to die for- FYI. As well as the turkey pastrami and the melted pb cup. Totally worth your time. My belly thanks me. And now I am off to take a nap from my glorious food coma."}
{"text":"Our party of nine was promptly seated in the back room per our 6 pm reservation. Having never sat in the back room, I was pleasantly surprised at the wall art which consisted of vintage sports photos and eclectic items.  We started off with drinks including Bloody Mary's which were well-made and spicy. Next were the appetizers. We  ordered zucchini fritters, hummus, and 18 oysters. The zucchini fritters were light, airy and not oily. The hummus was good although it's hard to really mess up hummus. The oysters were very fresh, and interesting in that they were very small. The oysters cost $2.45 each.  For the main meal, I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on an onion roll. It had a wonderful coleslaw type of dressing and was joyful to eat. Others in our party ordered jambalaya, steak, chicken stroganoff, and fish and chips. We all tried each other's food and seem to agree that everything was excellent.    Although we were stuffed, we ordered the  chocolate peanut butter dessert. It was nothing like I have ever seen. It's consistency was almost like a thick soup. Extremely decadent, it really hit the spot. Definitely more than enough to share with two or three people.  Service was on point and our particular server was very patient with a party of nine which included four children."}
{"text":"Server was young and new, but tried hard so no knock on them as the place was packed. Food was OK to bleh.   I can think of 100+ better places to eat in the Phoenix metro area that have the same types of food at better prices.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The tabouli is amazing, the drinks are awesome, and the salted caramel pudding is super tasty. The meat and cheese plate didn't have much meat and cheese though. ;) Our service was excellent and we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We went to the Arrogant Butcher for New Years Eve dinner. The New York Strip steak was amazing, possibly the best steak I have ever had. Our son had the Chicken stuff with crab and that was great too. Then we had the chocolate cake type dessert and that was well worth it too. Our server Shi was very helpful since it was our first time there and she would check in with us at the right time. We were very impressed with the food and service. I can't wait to go back and try to filet or possibly the jambalaya."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been added to my favorite restaurants in Phoenix for sure. The decor is upscale but open and modern at the same time. I really like it. Big bar area, all the top shelf liquor you would want. They have a raw bar with oysters, crab legs, and shrimp. The salads are big and awesome. This place has PRETZELS with PROVOLONE CHEESE for a starter.  They are perfectly golden brown little pretzel bites with melted provolone cheese. Freakin YUM!!! I have to say with a name like the Arrogant Butcher I was expecting lots of big cuts of grilled meat like, pork, beef, lamb, veal, fish etc, and the menu was disappointing in that area. I did go there for lunch so maybe the dinner menu has these things. I asked and our waiter said they do have more entrees on the dinner menu but did not specify, but that's OK cause we will be back to find out anyway. My girlfriend and I shared the Beef Stew and the Chicken Club Sandwich. I'll put it this way, the Beef Stew was probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Oh my god, so much flavor, green chilies, huge pieces of tender steak. I have dreamed about this stuff since i went last week. This is another must get on there menu, $15 and worth every penny!!! The Chicken sandwich was good. Thick piece of chicken, thick bacon, Swiss, and the fixin's. I liked it alot. We are so going back for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in here before the Diamondback's Social Media Night.  We arrived at 3pm, just in time for happy hour (not planned, but a welcome treat.)  My hubby ordered a Kiltlifter on tap (his go-to beer when it's the only good craft beer on tap) and I ordered a drink called \"The Fix.\"  It was a mixture of limeade with a dash of raspberry compote on top.  The glass was full, and I mean full, of ice, but it was ok, because it was the good kind of ice.  You know, the kind that comes in little, easy to bite apart balls.  Mix in the fruit compote, and the drink went from a little sour, to delightfully sweet and lemonade-y.  We ordered the Jambalaya and the burger and we split each item.  The burger was juicy and the sautéed onions on top were so flavorful.  The Jambalaya was full of chicken, shrimp and Andouille sausage, but I took a bite and got a monster chicken bone in my mouth.  Not enjoyable.  We had to signal the bartender for her to come over because she never just checked on us to see how we were doing.  If we lived closer to this place, it would be a happy hour that we would frequent."}
{"text":"Went here after a conference in the downtown area for dinner one night. I came later than everyone else, who was told there would be a 10 minute wait for 6 people. It wasn't 10 minutes before they were seated, so I joined them inside. Our table mates had ordered a few appetizers I happily shared. The smoked salmon dip was good, the pretzels and cheese were amazing and the artichoke dip was good. There is an off dollop of sour cream on the artichoke dip that didn't really belong, but it was tasty all the same.  I ordered the turkey pastrami and opted for a side salad instead of fries. The salad came with a champagne vinaigrette, which I wish came in bottles for purchase because it's so good! The turkey seemed like it was smoked or slow roasted and was way better than I expected for a sandwich. Many others at the table got steak, and one ordered the fish and chips. We all enjoyed it very much! Food deserves 5 stars, but it's a very loud restaurant and it closes at 9, so I couldn't give it more than 4 stars in my opinion.  The service deserves its own special shout out, as our server was kind and attentive and always refilled our water. It was a little hard to communicate because of the noise, but he patiently repeated every order until he heard us all correctly. It was also incredibly impressive that one in our party ordered to go dessert but forgot it at the table- and he ran after us to make sure she got her dessert! We were all over the moon at this kind of care and attention."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here. The first time was when I had jury duty and this time I got to enjoy myself with my wife. The chicken sandwich is just so freaking amazing. My wife said she loved the cubano very much and of course loved our beers on tap. Great place love the week days lunches."}
{"text":"Elevated bar/American food. Service is good, food is good, drinks are good, location is good... I guess what I'm saying is that it's good!"}
{"text":"Best lunch I've had in a long time.  If you are ever downtown, The Arrogant Butcher will not dissappoint.    Jonathon was an excellent server and was very knowledgeable and hospitible.  He made great suggestions and was amazing at his job.  Order the Charcuterie platter.  It featured a great mix of their specialties.  The green goddess ceasar was to die for as were the fish n chips.  Treat yo' self and dine at the Arrogant Butcher."}
{"text":"Love the nacho and pretzel appetizers- awesome!!! Great steak, fish tacos everything! Friendly wait staff, great atmosphere. Very clean and professional! Cocktails were also delicious!! Hot chocolate cake for dessert was good!"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Phoenix based off of the yelp reviews. I really don't understand why this place seems so popular. I thought it was just like an overpriced TGIFriday's. I got a burger, my husband got scallops (three scallops for $23!). Food was just OK, service was fine but not too friendly. There was a hour and a half wait if you didn't have a reservation. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great prices for the quality and quantity.  Everything that hit the table was gone in no time.  I will return."}
{"text":"Delicious beet salad! The pretzel appetizer was a hit with everyone at the table. Super friendly service. Bright and happy atmosphere.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my Hubby's and I first time here after a Sun's game. I had the salmon which had a banging vinaigrette sauce and my husband had the crab stuffs chicken with a lemon caper sauce. Absolutely fabulous! The service was fantastic. The wait was only 15 minute which is not bad considering this restaurant is about a minute walk from the front of Talking Stick Arena. We'll definitely dine here again! Great comfort food and service."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after a long day of traveling. It's our first time in Phoenix and a friend had suggested checking this place out, so we did. The inside looks great- modern, clean, very large. A bit noisy but hey, it's Saturday night. I went with the fish tacos while my boyfriend stuck to his usual burger and, as we usually do, we split halfsies. The burger was tasty, though nothing spectacular- worth the price. The tacos were pretty bland- not much flavor and they only give you two in corn tortillas with a small wedge of avocado in esch. Not worth the $17 what so ever, and I'm usually not one to complain. The staff was friendly, the place is a fun spot to be at, but be sure to choose your plates wisely."}
{"text":"I am only giving it a 4 since I took my order to go, but it probably deserves a 5. I wanted to grab a to go order of food before my flight back to Burbank.   I searched on yelp and decided that this would be a good place to grab food. It is located next to the sports arena and was within walking distance of my hotel and the convention center. The area reminds me a lot of LA Live in Downtown Los Angeles.   Since it was lunchtime, it was pretty emoty when I walked in, but it was happy hour. So while I waited for my to go order, I did get a beer to hold me overm the Grand Canyon American Pilsner hit the spot perfectly.   The service was great. The food came out quickiy and it was pretty good. I got the turkey pastrami sandwich, which would probably have been better if i ate it in the restaurant, but it was pretty good to go!   If I find myself back in Phoenix, i will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I don't get it...bad service, bad decor, and over priced...I'd rather go to a Ruth Chris or Morton's...the bartender put ice in a 16 year old single malt, and when I told her you don't do that, she took the class and poured it into another glass, keeping the ice! WTF?? Am I taking crazy pills? She said everyone orders ice in their scotch...yeah, maybe if they're a 17 year old boy and stole it from their dad's liquor cabinet...."}
{"text":"We had dinner here before the final Suns game Sunday evening. This is a fairly large venue with tables inside and out. We chose to sit outside.  We ordered our drinks, starter, and salad when our waitress greeted us. They have runners for drinks and food service. Our drinks took quite a while arriving after both the starters and salad. There were a number or empty tables so Service shouldn't have been overwhelmed. The house salad was fresh and nicely dressed. Our drinks are now empty we ordered wine to accompany dinner. The waitress brings the wine glasses and shortly thereafter a runner dropped our entrees off. Now we have food but no wine. Waitress checks on us to see if we are 'still Ok'. We have empty wine glasses sitting in front of us so no we aren't OK. Better than halfway through our entrees a runner arrived to pour our wine.  I had the scallops and my wife the salmon both dishes were good as would be expected given the price point. We dine out frequently some places work well and make for an enjoyable experience. This just isn't one. Mechanical unfriendly uneven service"}
{"text":"The food and service are both excellent here. We made a reservation  and we're seated promptly when we arrived. The waiter was very attentive and helpful with the menu as it was our first time.  The food was great as well,  we had the scallops and the prime rib. Parking is in the neighboring lots and they validate so make sure to bring your ticket with you!"}
{"text":"I think this place is good. Not great. Everything we ordered was pretty good (French dip, jambalaya, beet salad).  I just wouldn't say it really stood out to me and I probably wouldn't go back for dinner. The service was great. Drinks were just o.k. Maybe we should have ordered a steak..?"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Can here for my anniversary dinner and was pleased with the food. Our waitress was so nice and she was extremely helpful with any and all questions I had. The food was amazing! The salmon was cooked perfectly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher never disappoints. I leave happy every time we visit. The food, drinks, and service is always above par. Thank you for being an enjoyable establishment and for providing a quality of food that I continue to enjoy again and again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Arrogant Butcher twice, and both times have been phenomenal.  I've never had a problem getting a seat during lunch. The hostesses are really sweet and service is always prompt.   I suggest getting the pretzels with the provolone fondue. I made the mistake of filling up on it before my meal but it was SO WORTH IT. I also suggest trying the shrimp appetizer. It was also very good.  I had their burger which was cooked to perfection. My girlf had their fish and chips, also amazing. My beau loves their beer cocktail, the long legged blonde. Its the perfect summer time drink.   I have nothing negative to say about the Arrogant Butcher, except I wish it was a bit closer to me."}
{"text":"Decided to NOT go to the Arrogant Butcher today because... It was the night before Thanksgiving and we walked in and were asked if we had a reservation. There were quite a few empty tables. We were told there would be a 20 min. wait. So we sat down on the bench. No one filled the empty tables. Two guys came in and were told 20 minutes, and left. After 15 minutes of me watching this idiotic charade, the hostess came and said they had a cancellation, so we could be seated. More tables had emptied and were never filled while we were waiting, and during our meal, more emptied and were never filled. I thought about the two guys that left. They were lied to like we were...for what purpose, I have no idea. I guess you have to prove you want to eat there bad enough...and being a business owner nearby, I can't help but think that, at least to the employees, profit is not a concern. Why would I want to go back? I don't."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING service.  I mean it.  Selling without being pushy, attentive, prompt, and courteous.  Wine selection was great and I felt an excellent value, we had a Syrah and a Chardonnay.  I could make a meal out of the pretzel app, that cheese fondue is fantastic.  For the main course we had the Sweet Potato Tortelli and the Turkey sloppy joe, which paired well with our wine selections (I'll give my date credit for that) although we felt the tortelli could have been better.  Sloppy joe was delicious and the fries were perfectly cooked though not extraordinarily flavored (properly salted).  Blueberry cheesecake for dessert, it was good but I think if we went back we'd try the hot chocolate cake.  Fun lively atmosphere, open feel and comfortable booths.  Huge U-shaped bar and large windows."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here.  Food is great and the staff is awesome! We can't stop ordering the pretzel fondue.  It is delicious!  Highly recommend coming here if you want to impress your friends or family.  Such great drinks...awesome atmosphere and cool games to keep you occupied."}
{"text":"Pretty good! The best of the handful of places I've tried at Cityscape. Service was good, food was consistently good. Of anything my party ate, I recommend the pretzel & cheese appetizer--I've had plenty of similar appetizers at other restaurants, and I think this one is the best."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite downtown restaurants. I like taking out of town guests here. I've gone to many receptions there and I had my wedding brunch here in May 2016. The food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  Staff was friendly and overall the restaurant has a lively atmosphere. Our food was delicious and dish presentation was attractive.  One thing I wish we knew before we came to this restaurant is that there is a parking garage under the plaza where the restaurant is located and they give you a parking voucher when you leave."}
{"text":"Great service, vibrant scene, good food.  Charcuterie board was a bit parsimonious with their plating.  Entrees were appropriately sized if not larger than necessary.  Service very friendly and prompt even during the dinner rush.  Restaurant was bustling and buzzing at dinnertime."}
{"text":"The service was superb. The food was fabulous. The Pretzel fondue and the turkey pastrami sandwich were amazing! I Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't recommend this place for anything more than a beer and some very basic bar food. Very average menu, outside seating is nice and plenty of tvs around the bar. Had the chicken dinner - it was fine."}
{"text":"It was my first time and probably my last.  I went here for my birthday dinner and we ordered:  Pretzel Bites, Crab Stuffed Chicken, Sloppy Joe burger, Mussels, and Beef Stew.  I was not impressed.  The pretzel bites with the cheese fondue was just that.  Pretzel bites that were pretzels you can probably get at the mall or even at softball game in smaller pieces.  The crab stuffed chicken was a chicken sandwich!  Two chicken filets as the bread and the crab in the middle.  It was not good.  The sloppy joes was ok, but can't distinguish if it is better than any other sloppy joe burger i've tried before.  The beef stew and the mussels were forgettable.  I was pretty disappointed to have spent my birthday here..Happy Birthday to me."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, so whenever I'm in the area for a Suns game or for business, I try to stop here for a bite or drink.  My favorite item on the menu is the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich (Coleslaw, Swiss, Pretzel Bun), $12....it is soooo good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-arrogant-butcher-phoenix?select=oALX-Epc5ncGx6Aa93_DfQ#oALX-Epc5ncGx6Aa93_DfQ  The atmosphere is very casual and fun.  It's across the street from US Airways Arena, so it will be extremely busy on nights when the Suns play.  Awesome place to meetup for a pre-game drink though.  Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"The chicken stroganoff was darn good.  The salad was less than impressive but overall, I enjoyed it and would return."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.   From the pink drink, the salad with the champagne dressing and the turkey pastrami!!!!! I sat outside and the service was a little slow is my only complaint but I think the server was new -we all have to learn sometime!  I'd come back"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Solid. We came here during the middle of the downtown lunch rush hour with a party of 13 and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. Given the amount of people in our party, the waiters did an excellent job. The servers were polite, prompt and knowledgable of the menu. It is nice coming to place where your menu questions are answered without an eye roll and with confidence.  We started with the Pretzel Bun and Fried Shrimp with Jalapeño appetizers. These were amazing. The breading on the fried stuff was seasoned nicely and the Pretzel Buns coupled by the cheese sauce were simply irresistible.  I ordered the Cubano sammich and of course it was delicious. The amount of smokiness in the pork was a punch to the mouth but in a good way. Normally I don't like going back to work in a borderline food-comatose state, but this place was too good to not channel my inner fatty."}
{"text":"Ok RAVING REVIEWS for our waiter, Grant- & the manager- the team that seated & took birthday pics graciously for one of the best dinners EVER! Charcuterie - New York steaks were so delicious, perfectly cooked & beautifully presented-  too many details to speak of frankly.  Delish choc dessert too."}
{"text":"Love their appetizers, especially their pretzel cheese fondue. I prefer culinary dropout over this place."}
{"text":"Fox hits another one out of the park! Great place for lunch and dinner. Fun cocktails and a good wine selection."}
{"text":"delicious food, very small place. took forever to get seated and we asked if we could sit on the patio (which was EMPTY) and they said it would still be 45 min wait. not sure why since there was no one sitting outside. kinda far for us but great food"}
{"text":"This place was, hands down, amazing!  I'm visiting Phoenix for a conference, and decided to check out Arrogant Butcher after reading many positive reviews. I really liked the feel of the place as soon as I came in, very modern and industrial-looking. Although the hostess was missing, a waiter saw me looking confused and immediately seated me. He was very friendly and sent a waitress over quickly; I wish I could remember her name, she was really personable, too.  I ordered the short rib stew, and the waitress said it was her favorite dish. I can see why! I'm not a big fan of spicy food, but I took a chance since I'm in the southwest. It was incredible! The meat melted in your mouth, and the fried egg was the perfect touch. And the cornbread? I would go on a Zombieland style, shotgun-toting Twinkie-run for that cornbread, it was that good.  This place might be a little pricy, but it is worth every penny. There is a lot of thought that goes into their menu and food preparation. I hope I have some excuse to come back to Phoenix just so I can eat at AB again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at the Arrogant Butcher several months ago while running an errand downtown. The food and service were both excellent.  We had the nachos and the beef short ribs stew. The nachos were excellent.  The beef short ribs stew was unique, flavorful, and delicious.  We left the Arrogant Butcher feeling happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites. This is a very nice restaurants part of the Fox chain. It is more higher priced than others around it but you certainly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Mark Wilson:   The man, the myth, the legend. If you want a dining experience of a lifetime, Mark Wilson is your man. This man is a walking thesaurus and uses every descriptive word known to man kind to describe every dish on the menu. The positive energy thrives and he distributes his soul modestly to his guests. He is very passionate about his job and as a fellow fox restaurant server, I can appreciate everything about the way he went about his work."}
{"text":"The prime rib had the best rub or crust or whatever you call it that I've ever tasted. The meat was very flavorful too.  Other people at our table were a ltitle disappointed in the size of the meals for the price.  They had stuffed chicken and salmon.  The prime rib meal I had was great and good size.  Service was excellent. I'd love to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great spot!  I came for lunch while traveling in Phoenix on my own.  Sat at the chef's table and really enjoyed chatting with the staff and watching the busy kitchen magic.  Loved the pretzel dip (I'm slightly obsessed with little cast iron coquottes!) and the salad was incredible.  And huge, I might add--I took half mine home for dinner.  Everyone was incredibly kind and welcoming, and I came back for dinner a few days later :)"}
{"text":"Andrew S. the bartender was awesome and very attentive to all of his guest. Great conversation and personality made the food even better. The deviled eggs are to die for and the nachos were a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Lots of love in the salad!  Chilled bowls, attention to detail. Excellent Kale salad!  A few Loire wines by the glass-nice!  but the New Zealand Sea Bass($27) quite pedistrian....good but not worth ordering again.   I am from SF Bay area so never been here before.  I should of stuck with my instinct and stayed with the bar food.  I bet that have a great burger and meat loaf."}
{"text":"Several of us girls did a pub crawl and this place was our first stop.  Started off with Bloody Mary's which were very good.  We added the pretzel appetizer and it was really good....the pretzel were soft and salty the way they should be and the cheese was great.  We discovered one of the gang had never had oyster's on the shell so we ordered them...they were extremely fresh and great!  We ate 24 between us!  The table allowed us to enjoy the breeze and we had a great view of the sidewalk traffic so we could people watch.  The only issue we had was our server found an old friend and kind of forgot about us until we got his attention.  Bottom line we will go back again!"}
{"text":"From Sam Fox's Restaurant Concept group that brought us Culinary Dropout, Arrogant Butcher lived up to their name.  Long wait times, even with a reservation; self important wait staff; and prices higher than the food warranted- good, but not amazing.  After waiting at the bar for about 25 minutes past our reservation time, we were seated in a comfortable booth, but waited another 10 minutes to see any wait staff.  We also waited almost a half hour between courses.  It was a good tactic if the goal is to keep you ordering drinks.  We started with the Tabbouleh Salad $8 and the Crispy Shrimp $13.  The Tabbouleh Salad was good, but not exactly what we expected.  It was more akin to a dinner salad than Tabbouleh you would expect at a Mediterranean restaurant.  The shrimp were drenched in oil and not something I would recommend.  For entrées, three of us ordered the special- a 5 oz filet and 3 scallops with creamed spinach.  The entrée was good, but given the menu prices, we were surprised when we received our bill that it was $56.  The fourth in our group ordered the Sweet Potato Tortelli for $15.  She seemed the happiest about her meal.  For dessert we picked the warm peanut butter cup chocolate gelato and the salted caramel pudding for $6 each.  Both had a cloying sweetness where you could only eat a few bites.  However the peanut butter cup was pretty tasty if you dipped a piece of the cookie in the gelato."}
{"text":"Really cool place with a great menu and drink options. Was visiting on business and went back after my first trip. The scallop dish was amazing."}
{"text":"The bad service started at the door with the hostess in the gray dress black hair horrible, Did I say horrible, I really meant horrible. We were a party of four that ordered two meatloaves, Fish and chips and a salad. We had two house cabs and two sodas the bill with tip was just under $100. Fish and chips was very  greasy, meatloaf was just like the hostess horrible and the salad was something you would pick up at a gas station store. I wish I could post negative stars for the hostess alone."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Went to The Arrogant Butcher during its first week and for a place just getting its sea legs, it was pretty good.  Clearly the place is popular with the downtown crowd - which is clearly starving for more quality restaurants.  Casual, kind of loud atmosphere with an industrial feel to the decor.  The apps we ordered, the potato fritters and rock shrimp were both deep fried and solidly average, even though they were the top reocmmendations from our server.  The brussel sprout and squash salad, though, was excellent - I split it with a colleague.  The crab stuffed chicken was fine, but nothing special.  And, it was pan-fried - I had no idea I was ordering so much fried food.  We sampled a couple desserts and they were ok.  The server was very friendly and even comp'd us, without us asking, my colleagues' jambalaya which was too spicy to eat.  The manager also came over to apologize.  They're clearly trying hard at The Arrogant Butcher, and once they iron out a few kinks, I'm sure they'll earn at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful steak house. My steak was cooked to perfection.  We got lots of samples of food (we sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen...I highly recommend).  Everyone was super friendly and attentive.  We will visit the Arrogant Butcher again, next time we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. I feel like the first visit I would have rated a four. Service, for me, has been really accommodating and attentive which I love. The first visit, the food was really really good. We ordered the salted caramel pudding to share and it was about the only thing I remembered after about five cocktails. I hate...HATE pudding so I was very blasé about ordering it. UMMMMM.....amazing. It's super super rich and has a thicker consistency but it is out of this world for pudding.   Based on the previous experience here, we were looking for a centralized place to have dinner for a huge group of friends. We decided on Arrogant Butcher and made reservations for 7. We arrived at our table promptly and our server handled our huge group really well. We got our drinks in a timely manner and placed our orders. HUGE downside was when our food was being delivered to our table, half of our guests didn't have their food. We waited about ten to fifteen minutes for the other half of our table to get their orders. Once ALL the food was delivered almost everyone was happy with their choice. We ordered the zucchini fritars as an app and we couldn't even figure out what the heck it was looking at it and TASTING it! It looked and tasted nothing like zucchini. It was basically a basket of greasy, fried, nothing. It honestly looked like someone scraped whatever was at the bottom of the fryer and put it in a basket and served it as an appetizer.   The ambience is great and the service is good. The food is a bit lackluster for the price ."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about the Arrogant Butcher. Four visits on varying occasions have each resulted in different experiences and levels of satisfaction. I love the atmosphere and the overall experience, but the lack of consistency is noticeable and I have heard similar criticisms from friends.   My first trip to AB was for drinks and a snack during a break from a sporting event downtown. I went over alone (to escape) ordered a Manhattan and an appetizer. The Manhattans were perfect (who stops at one?), and the charcuterie and cheese were terrific and served with some unique accoutrements. However, it was some time before I was able to order that first drink, and in fact, almost left after waiting at the bar for quite some time without acknowledgement - and there were only about 5 other patrons nearby. Once I did get someone's attention, everything was brilliant, but I can never understand a bartender not promptly taking a drink order.  My succeeding trip was very similar to the first, waited at the bar with a friend for an inordinate amount of time before finally having our drink and order of cheese and some appetizers taken. The restaurant was not particularly busy and the bar staff was sort of milling around chatting rather than trying to make money by serving the two thirsty girls in front of them. Once we had our (very well crafted) beverages in hand, everything went swimmingly. This place does a stand out job of mixology and the bartenders, while less than attentive, do know how to make a great drink.   Third visit - dinner date (no worries boys, it didn't go that well): Service was wonderful in the restaurant and I wish I could recall the waiter's name. We ordered a couple appetizers again went for charcuterie and cheese. The stand out for me was the pate - then again, I am always a sucker for pate. My dinner date had a steak and I had the sweet potato tortellini, which was simply wonderful.   Fourth visit - birthday party for ten. This was again a super mixed experience. The restaurant seated us in a private room in the back, which was decorated with some very cool photos of Phoenicianicana. I was a little late in arriving so the crew had already devoured several appetizers and a plethora of oysters. From what I heard the mussels were a big hit and they liked the cheese plate as much as I did. The waiter was super nice, answered questions, took our orders and kept everyone's glass full.   Dinner was a bit of a mess. Two of the guys ordered steaks with the $18 crab add on for a surf and turf, one filet and one rib eye, both of which came out overcooked. One of the gals ordered the crab, and the waiter came and explained it had 'fallen apart' so they were bringing a new one. They did fix the errors, but it is ever so awkward to have part of your party finished with dinner while others are waiting on theirs to show up. I ordered the scallops and they were perfectly cooked, but I had to bite through sand in about half of them, which is just a bummer. After we'd already had so many issues I didn't want to add to the aggravation in sending something else back to the kitchen.   The GM did come see us, apologized and brought out a round of deserts. In a nice effort he brought two of each of the four desserts on the menu, which we all tried out. The stand out for me was the salted caramel pudding. No one really understood the warm peanut butter gelato, which essentially tasted like peanut butter soup. We were having a good time and we did appreciate the manager and waiter's efforts to apologize and take care of the issues.  The Arrogant Butcher has a pretty sweet little happy hour menu and now that my office is now less than ten minutes away, I will probably be stopping back in to check that out and am certain I will eat here again. I just wish they could regularly be as great as I know they can be."}
{"text":"So disappointed in my last visit.  I make it a point to stop in to this place every time I am in Phoenix on business because I love the food and the vibe of the place.  This last time I was in town I had to bring my wife for the first time and she was excited to go based on how much I talked about the place.  We had a reservation on a Sunday night a few weeks ago.  Despite the place being half empty, we were originally sat in the very far dark corner where the only people sitting near us had a small child that was screaming its head off.  Not the best setting for a date, so we requested to be resat outside.  Our waiter greeted us and was very friendly.  He took our drink order and a few minutes later returned with my drink, but not the wine my wife ordered, and said he would be right back.  We didn't see him again for another 15 minutes when he finally brought the wine.  He apologized and took our appetizer order, which was oysters, and our main course order.  We don't dig cocktail sauce so I requested one of their three other sauce choices at the time we ordered.  I appetizer was brought out by another server shortly after with, you guessed it, only cocktail sauce.  We let the oysters sit there and waited for him to return so we could get what we ordered.  After another 15 minutes, another server noticed we weren't eating and asked what we needed.  He informed us that the kitchen was out of the other sauce we wanted.  Our food came, by way of yet another server, and we ate.  Our original server never came by, never refilled our drinks, and in fact we did not see him again until we asked another server to bring our bill and then he magically appeared....apologized....and tried to kiss our butts.  Long story short, although the food was good, I was completely embarrassed that I took my wife to a place I held in such high regard only to have the worst service I have had in a very long time.  I will not frequent this place again if I get the same horrible service.  Time to look for a new hangout in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've decided that I like places where the menu is not 5 pages long. This way, you know what the restaurant is good for and known for and you go there for those specific items or specialties. Arrogant Butcher was a place that fits this description.   It's located in downtown Phoenix which is very close to US Airway center and the Chase ballpark. The place itself was quite huge with three different seating areas (the bar, main dining, and private rooms). The staff was nice overall and service was prompt because every server pretty much helps out each table. I know this may not seem like a huge factor but I liked it.   We ordered the pretzel and fondue which seems like a hit for everyone. it was good no doubt, but you would prolly get sick if you ate too much of it. As for the main course, I had the King crab cioppino which was excellent! Gf had the short rib stew which was also excellent. We polished those dishes until it was clean and was full with satisfaction.   Drinks were on the okay side. I had an old fashioned which was kinda watered down. Overall though, it was a very enjoyable experience with the food being the best part. Will definitely repeat again!"}
{"text":"We just had A-1 Garage repair help us with one of our garage doors. They were awesome!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I decided we were going to do the First Friday artwalk downtown in Phoenix this past weekend.  Living in north Scottsdale like we do, we don't get a lot of opportunity to get down south so it sounded good.  Apparently, tho.. we are not very arty as  our artwalk consisted of walking in one bank building and the room in it with old pictures of Phoenix on the walls and then we were done and ready for a cocktail..  Hey, go with what you are good at I always say!!! We started at Copper Blues and had a drink there first.. I had heard about the Arrogant Butcher and that was going to be ultimately our final destination.     BTW.. Copper Blues is pretty darn young.  I hear that the bands are good later but at 7 pm.. not so much my style.  So anyway, we were in the City Center but I swear we could not find the Arrogant Butcher. We walked in four bars along the way trying to find it... and the one on the roof was pretty cool.  When we finally got to the Butcher, we sat at the bar and were immediately attended to by a very nice bartender.  My friend had been asking for some kind of   liqueur that she got in Europe when she lived there and not one of the bars that we entered had it but the Butcher did!  Made her night...:)   We decided to eat light and ordered the pretzels with provolone  fondue and the Kale salad.  OMG.  I could have eaten the entire bowl of pretzels with cheese myself. Screw the diet!!! LOL... super tasty. And I really liked the kale salad too.. I personally am not a fan of their salad at the Quarter but this one was delish... it had marconi almonds and an amazing dressing.. and it was $5??? And that was not a happy hour price? Score!  BTW, the bar can get pretty crowded because of its proximity to the arena ... a game let out and there was some nice eye candy walking around which was enjoyable... so the whole trip was worth it... even with seeing no art."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Came for a dinner with the parents and wife.  Pretzel bites are amazing and reminded me of a childhood treat. The Beef Short Rib Stew was to die for, as long as you aren't scared of a little fried egg. All around an amazing dinner!!"}
{"text":"For the price point and menu and for the service and location we were completely happy diners! Greeted and seated promptly by a smiley hostess. Server introduced himself and welcomed us as this was our first visit. Explained some options on the menu and made some suggestions as well and never did we feel rushed.  We started with the Butchers Platter comprised of the chef's favorite cheeses and meats. A true charcuterie with this AMAZING house mustard! Aged White cheddar, goat Brie, truffle crescenza, prosciutto, hot coppa, salumi and all the fixin's like cherry marmalade, pistachios, olives... we. Ate. It. All.  Not sure about the oysters ( after all he's a butcher not a seaman ) we ordered two. Then two more and then another two just to be sure. The jalapeño mignonette was zesty and the perfect concomitant, a simultaneous explosion of flavor when eaten with the oysters.  Our little had the kids cheeseburger and he demolished it! Usually the fries are the first to go with him but not here, he was all about that burger.  The hubs and I had the french dip large enough to share with coleslaw. The horseradish was fresh and made this sandwich one of the best I've ever had.  Feeling like a couple of gourmands, I would have to say we left the Arrogant Butcher five star satisfied!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally went today with some coworkers for lunch. Got the Butcher's plate which was amaaazing! Also had the cheese ravioli and one of my coworkers had the short rib stew. Both were delicious. Need to go back and try some of those awesome looking drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"Love the pretzel bread and cheese- so delish! I also love the Carmel pudding and would go back just for that. My husband is not as impressed since his burger was burnt:( friendly service great atmosphere. Very hipster."}
{"text":"When I go into a town that is predominately one race that I am not, I can't help it but be more cautious about my surroundings.  It irked me when we got there first but another couple and group got seated first that came after us.  Hmmmmm.. ok we didn't wait that much longer so that's fine.  We ordered the double burger with seasoned fries.  Burger was over-cooked and so salty but fries were amazing.  We also ordered the beef short rib stew that had a nice kick to it.  I would order it again.    The waitress was upbeat and super friendly.  The hostesses on the other hand gave us the same experience as our burger.  ---- Serviced on 5/9 around 2:30pm"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but I also wasn't incredibly blown away. In retrospect, it's very possible we didn't make the best dining decisions though.   We'd JUST missed Happy Hour by a few minutes, and decided to sit outside to enjoy the sunset. If I came back, I'd probably sit inside since the decor and ambiance inside seemed very special.   Food: Zucchini Fritters - omg. AMAZING. Would definitely get again!! Beef Short Rib Stew - I think maybe this wasn't my cup of tea. I found it to be a little overly salted, and I forgot I don't love cornbread. I'd try something else next time around.  Drinks: Tried some of my friend's lavender drink and another friend's strawberry drink and both were good. Not overly sweet but not too dry either.  Service was SO sweet (including when I cut my finger under a table outside), but I found it to be just a tad slow. To be fair though, my friends and I were seated so it's very possible we were out of close proximity to frequent service. We were also in a rush to make it to the symphony, so that could have set the tone for maybe skewed perception of time."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The New York Strip I had was served pre-cut and the meat was chewy. I expected a lot more for $34. Compared to the steak I had at Durant's the next night, this was a joke.  The various charcuteries were just meh. They weren't horrible but definitely not memorable.  The name of the restaurant is a little presumptuous given the meal I had there. They should re-name it \"The Humble Butcher\" and reduce the prices of everything on their menu by about 50%."}
{"text":"In all accounts, everything is just fine. The best thing about this restaurant is it's location."}
{"text":"what a great place.. trying to be edgy and pulling it off.. very hard to do. great food."}
{"text":"Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Cheese plate and bread were delicious!!!  Prime location to sit outside and enjoy good weather.  The cheese plate was a good choice paired with a small salad and grilled asparagus.  I thoroughly enjoyed relaxing a sampling the quality food.  I wish I had time to sample more items, the menu was pretty extensive.  Quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Was pretty good but overpriced for what you get. We both ordered a steak salad and the amount of meat we each got was less than 3 oz."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best filets in Phoenix.  I was skeptical but VERY impressed.  You can pay extra for some steak toppings such as lump crab meat or shrimp, but be forewarned those sides are miniscule.  Not worth the price - stick with just the filet and the sides it comes with.  Plenty of food.  Be sure to order to pretzel bread with cheese as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"I was attending a conference in Downtown Phoenix...that's the only reason I was downtown! Arrogant Butcher was only a few blocks from our hotel, but we decided to drive since we were headed to the airport after wards.  It was extremely difficult getting there by car.  The roads were blocked and major construction was all around the restaurant.  Whew! We finally were able to park in the deck!  The restaurant did validate our parking, so that was a relief. The restaurant was packed, but our wait was only 10 minutes.  We started our meal with hummus, artichokes and sweet red peppers.  We added roasted elephant garlic as a side.  It was yummy...and the bread with the appetizer was pretzel bread.  My friend ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe and I ordered the Turkey Pastrami.  Both sandwiches were on a pretzel bun.  Both sandwiches were yummy and I would order again in a heart beat!  Turkey can be dry, but mine was the right amount of juice with a great spicy flavor. Nice way to finish my trip to downtown Phoenix, but not sure if it's worth the trip if you're not already in the area."}
{"text":"A really decent downtown spot. This place is good for all occasions and crowds. I've been here with family, friends, and colleagues for lunch/happy hour/dinner and it is consistently good here. I always have to order the pretzels and cheese, it's that good. The menu is full of many excellent options to eat and the wait staff is always attentive and helpful. It can get crowded here sometimes so making a reservation is not a bad idea. This place is very good, 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve a long review as i usually give.   Extremely overpriced for the quality of food you're getting. Over salted. Undercooked. No. Just no. We ordered the jambalaya and two burgers. All were terribly mediocre.   The service is a joke as well. It took 15 minutes to get water, another 15 to take our order, and 45 minutes to receive our food. Absolutely disgraceful.   This place has a great name but has a terrible attitude. I guess the name arrogant really fits! Will NOT be returning and will be spreading the word about how bad it is here for the price."}
{"text":"I had an epic dinner here before we hit up a show at the Van Buren. Our waiter was on point and super helpful. We tried multiple specialty cocktails. The butcher board, meatloaf, and the crab stuffed chicken. I had a visitor from out of town and everything was just so delicious. Will 100% be back."}
{"text":"This place is close to work and is often the choice for group lunches. I've only dined here once but I enjoyed the experience. I ordered the fried shrimp which was very well seasoned and fried to perfection. The servings are a nice size as well. The location is close to everything downtown and a great place to go for happy hour or group lunches."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but it does not live up to its Yelp hype, Phoenix.  I had a very nice beet salad, followed by the short rib stew. The waitress warned me that the stew was spicy but it was very very mild, I could not detect hardly a hint of the green chilies that are supposed to be in there. A menu like this could be a place that does good basics so well that it changes your life, or it could be above-average pub food and sadly I think it leans more toward the latter. Don't hesitate to go here, though, if it's where your friends want to go. You'll get good service and something tasty."}
{"text":"This looked like a decent place for lunch, plus it was walking distance from my hotel.  I wanted to grab a quick lunch without waiting for a table so I decided to eat at the bar. There was only one person working behind the bar so the service was  a bit slow.    I ordered an iced tea and the Chopped Salmon Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-arrogant-butcher-phoenix?selected=btFQyXf2UcCAS_X5F5zHeg#OIWtDNNlHFG-m1lmJaEztQ).  I was expecting a warm, juicy, piece of salmon on a bed of Kale, but the salmon was actually cold and smoked.  The salmon was on the saltier side, and I wish the menu let you know the salmon is smoked in the description.  The salad was made with kale, cauliflower, currants, almonds, and champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was okay, but the dressing was a bit overpowering in my opinion.  Overall, it was a salty salad with salty salmon.  I should have gone with the braised short rib stew.."}
{"text":"My girls were attending a concert at the US Airways Arena and I didn't want to be far from them as they are a bit young to be going to concerts in my opinion.  Anyway...  across the street is Arrogant Butcher and I'd heard great things about it.  I had high expectations and was not disappointed.  A great beer selection, great service and unique riffs off of chicken and shrimp made for a fun meal for my wife and I.    The crab stuffed chicken on a layer of spinach was delicious.  Before that we had a shrimp appetizer with fried mild peppers on top that was shockingly good.  We closed out with a salted carmel pudding that was small and tasty.  I'm glad they didn't give me more as I would have eaten that as well.  The portion was enough to be satisfying yet not so much that I was disgusted with myself afterward.  It's very likely that I'll be there once a month now!"}
{"text":"The food was great but over priced. The fire alarm kept going off every 5 minutes for about 30 minutes. The staff was friendly and it was in a nice location. We went for lunch and got the Butcher's Platter. It was well worth it."}
{"text":"We tried this with some friends after hearing good reviews.  We started out by splitting the Butcher's Platter, a variety of meats, cheese, and little goodies. I could have eaten the entire thing myself! The smoked salmon rillette and the crispy prosciutto deviled eggs were my favorite.  My husband ordered the meatloaf while I ordered the filet mignon. Our friends ordered the BBQ baby back ribs and the Prime rib. I remain partial to my filet, as it was perfectly rare and juicy. My husband's meatloaf was tender and flavorful and the smashed Yukon potato was sooo yummy! The prime rib was tender and the au jus was the most flavorful I've ever tasted. The ribs were also delicious, fall off the bone tender with just enough sauce.  I tried the After School Special, Snakeskin Boots, and Strawberry and Thyme cocktails. My favorite was the Strawberry and Thyme! Well worth the money!  We ended the night by ordering some desserts.  Our friends got the blueberry cheesecake which was so light and fluffy without the density that some cheesecakes have. I ordered the salted caramel pudding. It was heavenly! A grown up version of a dessert I used to enjoy as a child.  The service was friendly and the staff was able to answer all of our questions. It was a modern, trendy vibe without being pretentious or TOO trendy. There was a wide variety of people there, some dressed up and some not. Neither felt out of place. We will certainly be back! In the meantime, I'll be dreaming about that filet mignon..."}
{"text":"Pretty decent quality. Good selection of drinks, DELICIOUS appetizers. Slightly pricey, however."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday very busy I didn't have a reservation when I went for dinner. For how busy they were the 15 minute wait was not bad at all. We were seated for a table of. I ordered the ribs with fries, it was a bit pricey but it's a nice restaurant downtown, what do you expect. We split the order between two people and it was quite a bit, I couldn't finish the fries. We both order dessert and our bill at the end came to around 55$ together. Service is good as well, no problem with the service, they're well staffed."}
{"text":"Great service.food was wonderfull"}
{"text":"The service was great. But the food was just \"meh\" and overpriced. I ordered the crab stuffed chicken which was not actually stuffed. It was flattened, stacked, and pan fried which I wasn't expecting. I was looking forward to a healthier selection of chicken and seafood.  I was presented with an oil fried plate. :-/. First time and probably the last."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I went with an afterwork party of 4 on a Thursday night, and the place was already packed.  I'm glad I took the advice to make a reservation!  I ordered a few beers, the beet salad, and the Chef's Selection charcuterie plate.  The beet salad was big and bright - there were several types of beets, so it was more colorful than the standard red beet & spinach salad.  If you're not super hungry, the beet salad would be enough to fill you up.  The chef's plate was a fun rectangle full of food, everything from plain old pistachios to slices of smoked meats, two deviled eggs with truffles, a few thick slices of toasted bread with vinagrette, and more.  There was plenty for everyone to try everything.  Overall, a fun night in a loud and vibrant space, with good food.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, this will be the place to go with a group."}
{"text":"Great lunch options...  Including, but not limited to, the oysters, raw shrimp, steak salad and cubano sandwich...  Well executed and fresh ingredients..."}
{"text":"Add me to the growing list of fans..... this is an awesome place; another well thought out Sam Fox concept.  The Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel roll is one of the better sandwiches I've ever had.    Lunch is a bit pricey; but perfect for entertaining out of town clients, etc.  The wait staff is amazing; very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I love the filet mignon from here! It is paired with creamed spinach and a little toasty potato that I like to \"crack\" open! This all goes perfect with the cold Modelo's they serve. And for dessert, the salted caramel pudding is exquisite!!! I can not get enough! Enjoy coming here, they have indoor and patio seating as well. Always a treat when I come here!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar overlooking the food prep area.   This provided one of the most interesting nights out in an unexpected way. We were impressed by the management's final inspection of every dish before the server was allowed to take it to the table.  Our meals were tasty. My wife likes the stuffed bread sticks dipped in fondu. I prefer the mini sandwiches.  We had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"They were just ok. Nothing spectacular. Overpriced in my opinion.  No soup or salad with the meals. Tiny portions of sides. Service was good."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Had a blast!  Service was great and the food was even better.  Everyone in our 18 person group loved it.  Nice, clean, and fun....  A great place to spend part of your day......"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved everything about this place! Amazing service and melt in your mouth dishes. I highly recommend the beef short rib stew."}
{"text":"Only got to stop in for a minute before we had to go to the Chris Titus show so we just got some quick drinks and an app. We ordered the shrimp which came out fried, nice and crispy with a zesty sauce, considering we were in a hurry we enjoyed it, wished we could have had time for their full menu but next time for sure. Also loved their whole prohibition erA themed uniforms, will return if ever in Phoenix again and also recommend"}
{"text":"Everything was good-fresh drinks, delicious apps, and tasty entrees. Wait staff was polite and friendly. My only complaint is my water glass had lipstick on it and my fork wasn't clean. A little pricey but worth it for food quality food made from scratch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  My family goes here any time we're downtown:)  The environment is great, the food is unique and delicious, and the staff are always helpful and happy!!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken tabbouleh salad and it was very delicious! The relaxed lunch atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Service is attentive w/o being intrusive.  Had the pretzel/provolone appetizer (again!); and the short rib stew for something different.  Both were excellent.  Manager - Melissa, stopped by a few times to ensure everything was A-ok!"}
{"text":"Very hipster surroundings.  Has TVs.  It is a bit on the noisy side.  The food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the regular menu since I only came for happy hour, but my server was as awesome as the food. I had nachos and the salted caramel pudding which were so so good. Nachos are really rich so I gave them a squeeze of lime. I tried all of the happy hour cocktails (woops) and the taste was great but they aren't that strong. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I was visiting a friend in town for Super Bowl week Sunday, and we decided to watch the game and have dinner at the AB. We were not disappointed! The staff had no problem with us holding down a table for the whole game, and we enjoyed the craft beers on tap as well as the delectable menu. Our favorite item was the burtcher's platter appetizer: there was plenty of everything to share, and we decided it was easily one of the best fancy cheese plates either of us had ever had. I had the AB cheeseburger for dinner, and it was also pretty near perfect. At the end of the game, we had the hot chocolate cake and coffee for dessert. The cake was delicious! Warm and very chocolate-y (this is not a molten chocolate cake, it just has a very hot cocoa taste). I also really liked the house coffee blend.  I highly recommend this place to anyone passing through downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here.  They treated us excellently.  We had a table of 12 and ran late due to traffic and they saved our seats still even though the place was packed.  Definitely worth trying.  Since it was my birthday and my friends know I am such a foodie, I got a sampling of a few things that were ordered :)  I love my friends!  Fried Chicken - double coated and fried, very crunchy, excellently cooked tender flavorful chicken. It's a special of Thursdays. It was great! Pastrami Sandwich - great meat with cole slaw and excellent bread (pretezel, a chicago favorite!) Jambalaya - Very yummy, perfect consistency and great tasting.  Comes with Shrimp, chicken, sausage and okra, each piece cooked to the perfect consistency Cheese Burger - Perfectly cooked burger, great flavor, excellent bun made of angus beef, and cheddar and with grilled onoins   Salted Caramel Pudding - a nice sweet and salty treat to top it off, a bit overly on the salty side, it kinda burned my throat, but still very good.   Tid Bit: Free desert on your birthday Tid Bit 2: THey validate in the lot under them for 2 hours, after that it's 3 dollars for the first hour."}
{"text":"The filet mignon is to DIE for. ;) also I recommend the smoked ham and sharp cheddar cheese for an appetizer..."}
{"text":"Good place to stop into before a game at nearby Chase Field.  Had the House Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue as an appetizer. A bunch of mini roundish soft pretzels to dip in melted provolone. Very tasty and filling.  I had the AB Double The Meat Cheeseburger with Mushrooms and my other half had the Shrimp, Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya. Both were huge, tasty and filling.  We left stuffed."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre service was great the ambiance was great too. But the food wasn't as good the fish and chips had a lot of batter and were laid on top of the frjes so it was an oily soggy mess. My friend ordered the BBQ half chicken plate and at best was a ketchup sauce on chicken. The peanut butter cup was my favorite but would definitely not be back"}
{"text":"Just an amazing meal. Cool, industrial, yet cozy vibe. Excellent service from waiters who were knowledgeable and fun without being in-your-face friendly. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decent and interesting grub, service was a bit scatterbrained.  I would definitely go back and try more food. Eclectic menu."}
{"text":"3.5/5 it's aiite.  place already has a ton of reviews, but it's alright. i mean better than subway, but not the experience it sounded to be. or maybe i'm an SF food snob (likely)."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place before from coworkers as I work downtown but went in for the first time last week with my boyfriend. A random location we selected based on the Yelp reviews. It was about a 15 minute wait to get seated on a Tuesday night. For appetizers we had the fried shrimp and zucchini fritters. The fried shrimp...lawd... so delicious! The coating was sooooo very well seasoned and the perfect crispness. Would definitely recommend and is the primary reason why I would want to return. The zucchini fritters are actually puréed zucchini fried in a light batter. They were okay.   Entrees: My boyfriend had the sea bass and enjoyed it. I had the chicken stroganoff dish. Not impressed with it.  I wish there were options for sides as the sea bass was just the fish on a bed of creamy something (forgot what is was). The stroganoff could probably be eaten in 7-9 fork fulls. I can't say exactly because I didn't finish it all. The portion sizes are quiet modest so definitely order apps if you're hungry.   My boyfriend and I go out to eat often which include several five star restaurants and we were both throughly impressed with our server, Ian. Very knowledgeable about the menu, congenial, and pleasurable. He is amongst the top servers we've had. His happiness with his job exudes. Thanks Ian for the awesome service!!!   Overall, I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"First time last week for a large group dinner! The staff was friendly, just pretty slow.  Salad on the fixed catering menu was great, as was dessert. The steak was just not as expected to match \"arrogant\" expectations. It was not cooked how I ordered and lacked flavor.   Great branding, fun atmosphere.   My least favorite #fox so far!"}
{"text":"Sad to report this downtown destination was not too memorable. Had the New York Strip and it was on the dry/chewy side with that undercarriage of flavor that reminds you ever so slightly of liver - the sign of a cheap cut. Mentioned very politely to the waiter that the meat wasn't perhaps one of their best that week, and he pretended not to notice. My date had the salmon - it was noticeably devoid of flavor and also dry. Would be hesitant to return. So many better spots downtown."}
{"text":"First I need to address the decor; coolest, most relevant joint in town. The open kitchen and large dishes make you feel right at home. Multiple styles of seating and spacious. The server was friendly and offered great recommendations.   The prime rib French dip was over the top in flavor. And the fried shrimp hit the spot."}
{"text":"I tried the zucchini fritters with aioli as an appetizer and thought they tasted like hush puppies. I tried the crab stuffed chicken (with capers, lemon jus and spinach) and sampled some of my brothers filet mignon (Boursin Creamed Spinach, Crispy Potato for $36) and his gf's beef short rib stew with a side of corn bread (Green Chile, Fried Egg). The stuffed chicken was great because there was a lot of crab meat. The lemon added a great zesty and fresh flavor to the moist chicken. The filet mignon was very tender and was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The stew was a bit bland but the cornbread made a nice accompaniment. I also ordered a pineapple pisco sour (Pineapple Infused Mistral Pisco, Snap Molasses, Giffard Orgeat, Orange & Peychaud's Bitters) and tried my brother's butcher's blood and sand scotch cocktail (Pig's Nose Scotch, Cherry Heering,Carpano Antica, Orange Juice, Clove & Orange Bitters) and his gf's Modelo beer cocktail (after school special: Raspberry Tea Infused Jose Cuervo, Ginger Agave, Lime, Modelo Especial). The after school special cocktail was my favorite one because you got the side of beer in a can so it was the most bang for your buck. It was also the most refreshing to me The cocktails were about $10-12 each. Our waiter was extremely friendly, helpful and awesome. They have \"daily specials\" that aren't actually daily (only Thursday-Sunday). The decor here is really awesome and trendy. They have private rooms that you can rent out and also a larger dining area that has plaid booths. They have cool chalk art on the wall and a pretty snazzy bathroom with nice tiles (if anyone cares). The waiter said all of the appetizers, particularly the pretzel fondue were really good so I'd be interested in ordering more appetizers in the future."}
{"text":"I was in town from San Diego and stumbled upon this gem thanks to all you yelpers! Great steaks and hip young vibe. Will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If I had to describe this place I'd say: it brings the memories of growing up in a white picket fence home collecting baseball cards and a touch of industrial design (exposed ducts, concrete walls, etc). If this isn't the vibe they're going for then I can't tell you what the vibe is. Either way I'm still struggling to figure out what their menu and aesthetic is supposed to invoke.   We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening. The wait was roughly 20-25minutes. We were seated and the waitress arrived right away. The booth seats and the diner bar remind you of a 50s mom and pop place. The back with the poster filled walls remind you of a pub type feel. The bar in the front give a modern look to the place.   The menu, despite its charcuterie apps and steak entrees, still has a homey feeling. I got the rainbow trout because I wanted something light. I wished I ignored my logic and got a burger or a steak (because that's what they're known for said the waitress) because as much as I wanted to like my entree it fell flat. My favorite part of the whole fish was the green beans, because it had flavor. I truly did want to like it because I was impressed with the ambience and decor but I can't lie. The trout had a delicious crunchy crust on it but no flavor.   We saw many reviews mention the salted caramel pudding so we gave it a go. It is very creamy and sweet/salty. I'd suggest a cocktail that is a bit more strong or a coffee to pair with this dessert.   All in all, this place caters to a demographic that isn't me. And that's not a bad thing but it's just not my thing. I'd say if this review peaked your interest then give it a go."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in right as the doors opened and were greeted immediately. Everyone was very welcoming and we loved the decor. Our server Tony offered us the daily specials, answered all our questions and even made suggestions. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had the pretzels with cheese for appetizers. They were the best we've ever had! Our sandwiches were tasty and proportions just the right size. Loved everything! Everyone should give this place a try when downtown. They'll be thrilled with the atmosphere, people and most importantly the awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool and easy vibe, the customer service is top-notch and the menu has a great mix of items. We decided to check this place out for lunch based on all the yummy looking photos on yelp, however, we didn't realize there was a different menu for lunch. Though the lunch menu items looked good, we had our eyes set on the Crab Stuffed Chicken dish on the dinner menu, and our waiter made I happen for us! I'm so glad he went above and beyond to ask the kitchen to accommodate us, because we were not disappointed! The chicken had a crisp breading and was stuffed with just the right amount of crab in the center. The cream sauce with capers was light and tasty, though next time I'd ask for some extra sauce.   Also, most restaurants don't have Super Tuscan wines by the glass, especially for $10. Huge plus!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good but a little over priced. But the cheesecake was delightful with a tart, lemony-blueberry twist.  I felt it more than made up for the price of the sandwich.  The restrooms were clean and trendy.  I noticed a particular kindness of one of the  waitresses.  She held the door for me as I headed out.   Years ago I came here and ordered a salad.  I happened to get a bonus dragonfly... They handled it very well.  The dragonfly wasn't happy but they certainly remedied it to my satisfaction."}
{"text":"First off, first impressions are important and The Arrogant Butcher failed to make a good first impression. We had a 5:00pm reservation but were greeted, actually not greeted at all, by two very young girls who seemed to know little about hostessing.   Once seated, the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were given water right away which was appreciated.  The menu had some good options and we decided to go with the zucchini fritters, short rib stew, and the sea bass.  Zucchini fritters: light, fluffy, a perfect sized appetizer for sharing but very underseasoned. The aioli, however, was very tasty.   Short rib stew and corn bread muffin: amazing! Live up to the hype! Well done! The meat melts in your mouth and there was just the right amount of spice. The cornbread muffin was fresh, sweet, crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Yum!   Sea bass: This is the meal that I personally ended up with and it was terrible. I would've preferred a bowl of  just the barely because the fish was dry and flavorless. Horrible dish. The menu says it has artichokes but fails to mention that there are two paper thin slivers of artichokes! The barely was decent, under seasoned, but decent. I would never order this again. Worst sea bass I have ever eaten in my life. Might as well throw a fish stick on the top of this dish.    Service: It was just okay. The kid disappeared constantly and took quite a while to return but his colleagues picked up the slack. Service was very average.  We may return but we'd be more specific in the reservation and steer clear of that sea bass. Bleh!"}
{"text":"The pretzel bites with the cheese is to die for. Our waiter, I believe his name was Jeremy?, was informative and full of personality. I loved that.   Pork Carnitas was good and the burger was good. I would have liked the burger to be a little more seasoned, a little more pop, but we were so filled up with pretzel bites that I didn't really mind.   Definitely check this place out for a good time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was noisy and hectic.  We had to wait for our table even though we had reservations.  My brussel sprout caeser salad had tiny shreds of brussel sprout and huge hunks of bitter cabbage.  The only part that was really tasty was the warm peanut butter cup which was like warm PB mousse with chocolate gelato on top. Yum!  all of that being said, they appear to have amazing charcuterie, with many cheeses and meats available, but we didn't order it bc no one else at the table was interested.  Next time (if there is a next time) it will be charcuterie and dessrt for me!"}
{"text":"Happened on this place and it just wasn't a coincidence that we found the best place!!  Menu is well balanced the food, great starters plus selection of meats and cheese.  The Deviled eggs are in many restaurants right now and these do not disappoint! I ordered the salmon with no potatoes and extra vegetables, they didn't charge me more for the substitution, nice.  I would have paid but it gets tiring when some restaurants inform you of this.  Great find for a walk by!"}
{"text":"Extremely average food for an above average price. The drinks are not very good. The old old fashioned was watered down and lacked body."}
{"text":"The food and service were okay.  I was not WOW'd by my meal (carnitas) although the place has a great reputation.  Good environment.  Big bar area."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a pub crawl. Meh selection on tap, however I had the \"pink drink\" which was delicious (the rest of their signature drinks looked tasty as well).  We did try the pretzels w/ provolone fondue. I would come back soully for that.   Really interested to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! My friend and I made a reservation for dinner before the show we were seeing at Comerica and we had a fantastic time. My friend had been there plenty of times before and suggested we go. I had the strawberry thyme cocktail, which was delicious and refreshing. As a starter, we had the pretzels and fondue. As someone who is not a fan of cheese and pretzels, I didn't know how I'd like it, but I was pleasantly surprised! I am a fondue fan, so I think that really tipped the scale there. For the entree, I tried the meatloaf and absolutely loved it. The portion was large, which made it a great value, and the potatoes were rich and delicious. It was an elevated take on the home style classic. My friend had the sea bass, which she raved about. Overall, we had a very enjoyable meal. The atmosphere is lively, the servers were attentive; I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Certainly not a place where you go to eat a kale salad but that's what I had and it was pretty good actually.  It was kale that was heavily sauced with some vinaigrette dressing.  $3 draft beers for happy hour is a great deal.  I also had the pretzel appetizer that came with a container of cheese.  It was fine but a lot to digest.  Service and staff are what you'd expect out of a sports bar type establishment.   Not the best and barely attentive."}
{"text":"Lively bar, great drinks and yummy happy hour bites...if you are in downtown, come here for sure..menu is awesome.."}
{"text":"Cheese plate is amazing! Always a great meal here. It's a must stop when in town for Baseball Spring Training."}
{"text":"We picked this place because it seemed like a nice restaurant by the ballpark. I was very disappointed by the food. The prices were fine for the location. I got a french dip. It was small and had very little flavor. The bread was dry and without the au juis, would have been hard to eat. I ended up eating the meat off the bread because it was just too much. I didn't like the beer selection, and the one that I ordered was way too sweet.  As far as the service, our waiter was slightly obnoxious. He was trying to be funny or whimsical, but it came off as annoying. Especially when our food took way to long to come out. He didn't even mention it or apologize, he just kept flirting with the girls at the table next to us.  We ended up missing the beginning of the baseball game, even though we told him we were trying to make it there in time. This place is just a fancy covering over an okay chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!!!My husband's birthday party was held there and we had an AMAZING time. The service, atmosphere, and food were impeccable.  There was at least 100 people there and my water glass was never empty :). I haven't had service this good since I was on a cruise. I look forward to going back real soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. I had the salmon chopped salad and a side of fries to balance it out.   The salad was delicious. One of the best salads I have had out. The salmon was smoked and added great flavor. All the ingredients paired together beautifully.   The side of fries was huge. More than I expected. And tasted good. You can't really mess up French fries.   Service was great. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful.   Restaurant had great ambience and there was an open kitchen.   Overall, I had a great experience and will definitely try them again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  Service was fantastic and atmosphere is relaxing and modern.  Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner, before our comedy show at the stand up life at cityscape. Made reservations ahead of time and we were seated immediately.   Really nice place to hang at. A decent menu where they had a selection of food and drink options. I selected the fish and chips. And ordered the \"After school special\" cocktail which I asked the server about ahead of time, as it has tequila in it, and I'm not a huge fan of it's flavor but I do drink it. Server said that the ginger and beer flavors would wipe out the taste, which had they did. It wasn't a great drink, it was just average.   The fish and chips on the other hand was a hit for me. Good flaky fish and the batter was very light. I would definitely come back if in the area, despite the fact there are other options near by, but this place was decent. Personally not a fan of chain restaurants but Fox Restaurant Concepts have been doing a great job here in Arizona. Good menus and flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Good service. I can particularly recommend the pretzels and cheese, as well as the turkey pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"Such a gem. My son and I walked in, looking for a drink and decent food. This was so much more.  The meat and cheese platter was outstanding. One of the best I've had.  Spicy mustard.  Truffle aioli.  Cherry preserve.  The cornbread and toast and pistachios and sliced meats and smoked salmon and cheeses along with all those condiments was just fun in our mouths.    Then my son did the kale salad while I did Mediterranean.  He won.  Lemony goodness with almonds and cauliflower and kale. Yeah it may also be healthy.   My Mediterranean salad was good but just a little overly tangy for me.   The Pinot noir wine suggested by Ty was outstanding. My son had Deschutes ipa, a favorite of his.   Lovely afternoon lunch.   Sigh."}
{"text":"Fish and Chips were great, light and flaky.  The Burger was a little dry.... Good flavor.  Artichoke hummus was Great, make sure they give you enough pita bread up front.   Biggest disappointment was the Ranch dressing !!  It had a really weird vinegar taste.   Service was great!!! Thanks Alejandro."}
{"text":"This is a tough restaurant to rate.  The reason being is the service is good but the food is definitely not good.  Especially, for a Fox Restaurant.  Save yourself from the disappointment.  I tried all 4 dishes on the table and my Girlfriend couldn't even eat her Kale salad.  Pass on this overrated restaurant.  If it wasn't across from US Airways Arena it would not stay in business."}
{"text":"LOVED it here!  Great service (well except the greeting hostess), food was excellent, drinks were excellent and everything locally grown and sourced.  Mmhhh"}
{"text":"Went here after a work meeting downtown after a friend recommended it. We got pretzels with cheese, shrimp, and zucchini fries for appetizers. All were delicious, especially the pretzels. For the main meal I got the Filet Mignon with creamed spinach, potato, carrots, and a side of asparagus. The Filet was cooked perfectly and could not have been more tender and juicy. The spinach complimented the roasted potato very well. After it was all said and done I was very happy and satisfied. The decor was modern and was just an all-around awesome downtown dinner and drinks sport in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there for lunch on our \"day out\" downtown.  We had a little bit of a wait when they discovered we didn't have \"reservations\", but it wasn't bad. The food was very good.  She had the sweet potato pasta dish, and I had the turkey sloppy joe.  We shared a pretzel/fondue which was pretty good.   It seemed like mostly the business crowd there, and our first waitress seemed to \"dump us\" onto another waitress so that she could go waite on some \"suite and tie\" small group, but our new waitress was very nice and helpful with wine suggestions.  Overall it was pretty good food, but not sure it was worth the prices.  The atmosphere was not too bad, but again, more business crowd than others.  We sat out side which was nice, because I don't care for most of the inside tables that seem to be so close or \"shared\" areas.  It seemed like trying to have a private conversation in those areas looked impossible, and pretty much saved for \"certain groups\"."}
{"text":"This was my third time, and I just keeping chasing the high that was my first time at Arrogant Butcher. Looking like I will never get the quality that I got the first go around. I ordered the scallop dish and the first time it was amazing. One of the best all around dishes I had ever had. The second visit I ordered them, and they were raw in the middle. Fluke perhaps? Last night I gave it another go and the vegetables were undercooked and the scallops were chewy. Sad, really. I seek out restaurants with consistent food quality. This is another to add to the list of unpredictable, sub par meals.   Plus side: Waitress was friendly and relatively fast. The Pinot noir wine offered is one of my favorite bottles ever. The ice water is good, and thankfully doesn't have a weird taste that is commonly found in restaurant water.   Was hoping that the third time would be the charm but sadly, I don't think I will go back for a fourth."}
{"text":"I wanted to really love this place, but I could only like it. The service was spectacular. They messed up our order and admitted the problem up front and worked hard to make it right. Our server was the best ever...I don't remember his name, but he has been referenced on here. The food was creative, but the flavors didn't really come together. The food is a two, but the ambiance and service a four."}
{"text":"great outside patio, terrific service, outstanding food.  Get there for happy hour, enjoy the food, but get the salted carmel pudding, it's to die for."}
{"text":"Great fried zucchini fritters with fun aioli! Had rib eye sandwich like French dip Not so good. That salty bland and plain weird au jus sauce on the side was inedible Ate the sandwich with the aioii.  Choked it down from pure starvation and too uncomfortable to complain-business lunch and short on time. :( Great lemonade Beautiful sparkely waitress Nice atmosphere Would go back again to try other items that are raved about and of course a Long Island ice tea"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and Yelp comes through again with another winner!  Nice place across from Talking Stick Arena in downtown Phoenix.  We walked in and the asked if we had a reservation. We didn't but they accommodated us anyway at the chefs table.  Nice assortment of salads, sandwiches, entrees and chartreuse.  I had a turkey sloppy joe which was seasoned perfectly in a tomatoey sauce with pepper jack cheese, and a poblano pepper on a delicious brioche bun. It came with a nice side salad of baby greens, tomatoes & curls with a wonderful oregano flavored dressing. Great service and decent prices too!  I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my gold standard of food. An incredible (seriously incredible) steak on top of a perfect ratio of spinach to Boursin, topped with a few carrots and a potato on the side. It wasn't too much food, and I truly savored every bite."}
{"text":"I have always been a Fox fan, but my first expeience here wasn't the best. My BF and I went here before a Suns game for our anniversary. We made a reservation because we know how the places around get on game night. They were 25 minutes late for our reservation, and the hostess seemed irritated and gave us a bad attitude when I asked how much longer. We finally go to the game after the fun intro stuff. Our dishes were just mediocre that night. Like I said I am always a huge Fox restaurant fan, but I think next time we will choose something else before a game."}
{"text":"9:30 pm We came here to eat after a concert we had left early from. We don't live here and didn't know what to expect?  We were referred by our hotel valet so we thought we would try it. Walking  thru the front door we had  to interrupt the hostess/host to ask for a table. They were in a deep conversation. Got sat,hostess not friendly at all,actually never said a word to us. Server came by super energetic but come to find out he was just  taking the drink order, All drinks came out fast expect for my wine from the bar. This place wasn't busy. Ordered an app early from the drink guy. When our server finally showed we ordered an another app after finding out all they serve is kale and leaf lettuce. She said your Nachos will be our before pretzel . Since we ordered nachos earlier that's what we expected. Well that didn't happen of course. Pretzels came out then eventually the nachos. Would never order the nachos  again!!!! Pretzels  snd fondue were yummy though!!! Not sure why the lack of service here... They had have many employees just standing around."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, tap water isn't filtered, so have to get Pellegrino, but I like this place for business lunches or a nice dinner out downtown."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Have had dinners here a couple of times, so time to catch up on my Yelping. Reservations for 8 on a Thursday night. Seated quickly. First thing you notice is the place is LOUD, but that also seems to be trendy these days. I had the Short Rib Green Chili Stew, which is always very good here. Wifey went with the Fried Chicken, this was ok. Not great, little too much with the honey drizzle making it more sweet than anything else. We wanted the Charcuterie board, but our Waiter forgot to put our order in, so that will remain a mystery. If your feeling the need for a hipster/trendy joint, this place will fit the bill. Nothing spectacular, but great location means we'll be back."}
{"text":"Well the arrogant butcher lives up to its name. I think they are very proud of their food and the prices show that.   I went with a co worker and we both left with sorta of a meh  feeling.   Swevice: While our server did nothing wrong he seemed to have a very fake attitude. Like he did not enjoy his job but is pretending to.   Drinks: This was our biggest complaint we both had Titos with Juice and Coke respectively. At 8.00 this was the weakest drink I have ever had.   Food: Chicken Stroganoff and Short rib stew.  Both entrees were fine but I would not go out of my way to come back for either. I also had 2 oysters that honestly seemed a little shy of fresh.   Desserts. This is where they shine. I had a wonderful chocolate cake and the other dessert was a peanut butter cup with 2 cookies and a kinda if peanut butter soup. 5 out of 5.   If I was downtown I would go grab some meat and cheese but skip the entrees and drinks."}
{"text":"Another Sam Fox unique concept. Took some colleagues for lunch had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel bun tasted excellent. Great place for a lunch meeting in Downtown! @debbieporterfrc"}
{"text":"We were underwhelmed with our dinner experience.  Sad to say.  We wanted to love it!  The place is probably really fun for young professionals out for happy hour, but for a family dinner it is nothing that delicious or comfortable.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with large group and they seated us outside with hanging screens to separate from sidewalk. Area robbers must know about openings between these screens because we a member of our group get her purse snatched. A chase ensued and thanks to the courage of strangers, the purse was retrieved.   The food was mediocre at best and took forever to arrive from a fixed price selection.  Incorrect drinks were brought. We were almost charged for two in our group who couldn't make it and obviously didn't order food. The waiter had an attitude when we challenged the extra charge. It was until we reminded the manager about the purse snatching that they backed down. I would never return here. There are much better options with better service."}
{"text":"This place is good but not great for the price. I had the scallops for $27 which is on par for fine dining but not executed like fine dining.  I prefer my scallops with more of a high heat sear on the outside but a little rare on the inside. My boyfriend had the prime rib French dip sandwich served with fries for $19. The fries were hand cut but not very crispy; neither shoestring fries nor thick steakhouse fries. It was definitely worth trying but it won't be part of my regular rotation.  I might come back for Happy Hour, 3pm - 6pm weekdays."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix. The ambiance is great, staff is friendly, and food is incredible. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came in for restaurant week and found that it wasn't that great of a deal.  Had my husband gone with the prix-fix menu for $30 and ordered what he wanted, it wouldn't have come to $30.  Well, they did include a glass of sangria, that I suppose would have put it just over $30, but not everyone likes sangria. So, he ordered off the regular menu. We started with the homemade chips, which I believe are the same ones on the Culinary Dropout menu.  We like them.   He then had the roasted poplano chicken chowder.  He said it was tasty, but wasn't (temp) hot.  Then, after seeing the stew on the cover of Phoenix Mag., he ordered that.  He was quite disappointed.  The egg was overcooked and the stew was bland and it was a very small portion (unlike the picture). I had the prix-fix menu and started with the tabboulleh salad.  It was quite good.  My entree was the crab stuffed chicken.  A little odd and way too much breading on the chicken. I will say, though, the salted caramel pudding was very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place on a Saturday night and had a drink at the bar. Nothing special when it comes to beers. 5 or 6 on tap..... Came back on a Wednesday night for dinner and WOW! Visiting Phoenix we had a great experience at Culinary Dropouts and decided to try this place again. It was a pre lady GaGa show which we weren't aware of so the place was packed. We scored some really good seats by the chef area.... 5 white stools right at the kitchen where they make salads and the pretzel fondue. If you can get these seats grab them!!! I had filet mignon and friends had jumbalaya. Food was excellent. The chefs at our station were non stop busy filling orders for the restaurant yet they gave us a plate with toasted bread, home made jelly and mustard, cheese and their thin sliced meat. I was also given a horseradish sauce for my filet. At the end of the meal out of the blue the salad chef put a desert infront of us before the waiter could even offer it.... We weren't going to order desert but couldn't resist. Staff was super friendly and food was excellent. Been in Phoenix for 10 12 days with only 2 left... Wish we had found this place sooner! Def don't have places like this in NJ/NY."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and we had fantastic service here. My only issue is  I would have preferred happy hour but didn't realize it was just in the bar, and the host didn't mention that.  I was interested in a lot of the menu options, but we were waiting for a concert, so I didn't want to eat a lot of heavy food. I ordered a can of some kind of beer that I wish I remembered because it was delicious. This is the type of restaurant where they always bring you a chilled glass and pour most of it out for you. Not necessary, but it was nice.  We were in a quiet corner in the back but noticed everyone seemed to be eating the pretzels as a appetizer, which we ordered. We received a fairly large basket of pretzels plus a fondue pot of cheese with a small tealight under it to keep it warm. What a cute idea! The cheese stayed warm without overcooking while in the pot. The pretzels were delicious, just the right amount of flaky salt.  I ordered their caesar salad, and it was delicious. It came with a few vegetables I didn't expect, which I really enjoyed. I don't care for brussel sprouts but didn't even notice them. The only issue was the dill in the salad. Instead of chopping it, it had had a lot of dill sprigs in it, which wasn't great to eat. I just moved them to the side and picked off little bits here and there.  Overall, a bit pricy, but you'll enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is solid, good food & friendly service... this is one of the places that does it right day in and out. Please keep up the good work, thank you.  Update, best staff EVER. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the acoustics are terrible. It's always so loud inside! The pretzel cubes are delicious!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant after seeing all the great pictures and reviews on Yelp. I was here on a Sunday night and the kitchen was slammed. They were sold out of the pasta dish I wanted and it took an hour (not exaggerating) for our plates to arrive.   My friend told me you should never order seafood in the desert. Now I know why, because my salmon was so overcooked and dry that I had to ask for extra lemons just to make the taste bearable. My colleagues had burgers and a kale bowl and only 2/6 of us enjoyed our dinner.  Maybe it was an off night during our visit, but our experience was really disappointing. Although our server tried to be nice about the slow service, he did not really do anything to make up for it."}
{"text":"Had this bookmarked for a place to go before a Dbacks game. Went on a Friday around 4:30 and after a brief wait got seated in the bar area for Happy Hour.   I'm not big on pretzels or pretzel buns but the House Soft Pretzels are really good, particularly with the fondue. Draft beer specials (12 oz) were cold and reasonably priced. I indulged in a few nice IPAs. Nothing else on the HH menu demanded our attention.  For dinner I had the King Crab Cioppino, others in my party tried the ribs and assorted meats and cheeses. All-in-all, I found the entree quality good but the portion size is smaller than I would expect.  The charcuterie was a joke though. With several meats and cheeses ordered, there wasn't much to show for it except the desire for more. I believe the waiter said portion size is meat 1 oz and cheese 3 oz. Regardless, good quality but lacking seriously in quantity.  Service was good although a bit more attention desired, particularly to my empty water and beer glasses!  I would go back but I would be very selective in what I ordered. Sandwiches at next table looked great, so I would probably go that route, along with some other appetizers."}
{"text":"Chose this place because of good yelp reviews. They are very busy but walk in wait times were reasonable. The ambience is welcoming!  The food was excellent! My daughter had steak, was perfect. I had the tortellini, absolutely amazing!  Service was above par! Had a great time!  Suggest a reservation if you do not want to wait!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the food is pretty good.  Pretty good is about all I can say though.  There are a lot of items that are greasy  or just lack flavor.  For the prices you're paying it isn't exactly value.  I prefer almost all of the other Fox Restaurants to this one.  What it is good for is happy hour before a Suns game.  And desserts.  The desserts are solid!"}
{"text":"We were headed to Stand Up Live last night and looked for a restaurant near by so decided on The Arrogant Butcher.  Great choice!  We dined with another couple and shared the Provolone Fondue with Pretzel buns which had us licking our fingers.  The entree choices included the Chicken Stroganoff, two of the Jambalayas and the Sweet Potato Tortellini.  All were excellent but the Sweet Potato Tortellini took the prize as the most original and delicious dinner.  We had reservations for 4:45 and were seated immediately.  We were surprised at how crowded the restaurant was but City Scape has an ice skating rink set up in the middle of the block so there was a lot of activity in that part of downtown.  We don't get downtown that often but would definitely make a special trip to dine at The Arrogant Butcher again."}
{"text":"I had always seen the sign for this place when I was in Phoenix and I loved the name. Finally got a chance to stop in for a bite.   It was a Friday night and it took about 15 minutes to get a seat but the hostesses were great at getting everybody's name entered in to receive a text when a table was ready. The atmosphere and decor is super warm with all of the candles on the tables.   We ended up eating on the patio area because it was a nice evening and an event was just letting out which allowed for some great people watching.  The waiter recommended the pretzel fondue which I was totally ok with because I adore pretzels and cheese. It came out ridiculously fast which almost made me wonder if someone had cancelled their order of the pretzels and cheese because the cheese had a touch of a skin on it and the waiter kind of stuttered a weird little apology about how sometimes they have them right there and ready to go.  We enjoyed a couple of local beers that were on tap and dove right in to the pretzel fondue. The pretzel bites were delicious while the cheese was just merely satisfactory. The only thing is, as I was eating the pretzels, I was still perusing the menu and started to become full. I was debating whether or not to even get an entree. When the waiter came back, I asked him about entrees that were on the small side but I also told him I was considering the pork carnitas or maybe just ordered a side or a salad. He ensured me that the carnitas were on the small side so I would be just fine. I realize in retrospect that a waiter is always going to have you go for the more expensive option to have your bill increase (along with their tip).   When the carnitas came out, they were actually a decent sized entree. Some of the bulk did come from the cabbage slaw that was piled about 3 inches high on the two corn cakes. I was so full that I only took about two bites and had to ask for a to-go box. My review on my entree was eating it the next day. My next-day pork carnitas were delicious. I really enjoyed the slight sweetness of the corn cake and I felt like I could eat just those by themselves. I liked the combinations of all of the flavors although the cabbage slaw was on the excessive side. I also had a weird bite where I swear that there was an errant walnut, which must have fallen in. My dining partner had a burger and I believe that he was sufficiently satisfied with his burger for the evening.   Overall, the food was decent and the staff were very efficient and friendly in all of their interactions. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the location of this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I enjoyed the variety of foods and the nice quick service. I had the nachos and I really enjoyed them. My friend and I shared our food and we went home with left overs."}
{"text":"We came downtown to see a comedy show and stumbled upon the Arrogant Butcher to have dinner first.  We arrived about 6pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately by a friendly hostess.    The star of the evening was our server Tony, who was ... I never use this word .. delightful!  He told us all about the menu, the place, himself - very fun server and always on time with everything.    The food was great!  That was the best hummus I've ever had and I'm a big fan of trying it from everywhere.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the crab-stuffed chicken.  We loved our food and cocktails.    All in all, a great dinner out!  Thanks to Tony and the crew."}
{"text":"I had stew it was good, decent, spicy and fairly priced. They brought us an appetizer with spicy mustard which was really delicious"}
{"text":"On a quick trip through Phoenix we stopped by this restaurant to grab a bite before heading to the airport. Loved the location, atmosphere, and food. Great place to chill an enjoy a drink or nice meal. Service could of been better but maybe it was an off night for everyone it was New Year's Day. Other than that we enjoyed everything else. Will return next trip."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are fantastic. And the happy hour deals are phenomenal. Unfortunately, our server, Meagan, certainly put the \"arrogant\" in Arrogant Butcher. She was nasty to our whole party from the moment we sat down. A table for 14 people, and when asked for more than one happy hour menu, it was a huge inconvenience to her. She was unfriendly the whole time, and specifically told us we couldn't move seats if we wanted our checks to be correct. It was a social visit with people getting up throughout the evening! And when it came time to pay our individual bills, she refused to take my credit card TWICE because she would only take EVERYONE'S payments at one time. Finally I told her I was wanting to leave and she begrudgingly took my payment. If it weren't for her, I'd be returning soon."}
{"text":"Had a great time at The Arrogant Butcher. The food was absolutely fabulous & flavorful. The drinks were great as well. I ordered the Crab stuffed Chicken. The chicken was a deep fried, lightly battered, boneless breast which was complimented by a crab cake that was absolutely heavenly. I loved it so much, I actually cleaned my plate (which is very rare for me). The Service was nothing less than \"stellar\" simply put, this was a great restaurant with great food, great drinks and equally great service. If ever back it Phoenix, I will definitely come again, the rating found on Yelp is well deserving. Give it a try, I'm sure you won't regret it; Bon Appetite! Addendum: Now that my trip is complete, I can honestly say that if you are visiting and near the downtown area of Phoenix, put this spot at the top of your list, it is my top pick of all the Restaurants I've visited."}
{"text":"Holy AWESOME! We had the pretzel fondue appetizer which was KILLER! I had the fish & chips and that was great to! They serve local micro brew beer from Sun Up  Brewery (I had the Light Rail Ale, of which, I was not a fan of).  The interior is beautiful and has a very open feel (high ceilings). There's really no way to describe it, but it appears that this place has a few themes that all work together just fine.  They have outdoor sidewalk dinning!  Now for the bad side ... it aint cheap. My girl and I had an app, two entrées and one drink each and our bill was $80.   This place has the best location in CityScape and I have little doubt that this new Fox creation will THRIVE here. Yea!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great! Definitely worth a visit! Our apps were delivered after our dinner so the waiter gave my friend and I each a free glass of wine. Such great service!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on impulse. Three different lunch meals which were all tasty. I had some delicious oyster as an appetizer followed by the fish tacos. Others has fish & chips and Cuban sandwich. Fair service and pricey."}
{"text":"I stupidly ordered fish. Obviously not a fish place.  Should have gotten red meat.  Stupid me.  Great service."}
{"text":"Traveled to Phoenix on business & visited this restaurant on a friend's recommendation. I started with the deviled eggs that were topped with prosciutto... DELICIOUS! The cocktails were awesome. The decor is very \"trendy rustic\" It's a little pricey but not stuffy. Great place for a few non typical drinks, a date, or casual business drinks."}
{"text":"Ask for Andrew, best waiter ever! Was in Phoenix on business and by recommendation of yelp and hotel we ended up at the Arrogant Butcher. The food is absolutely amazing, I had the sea bass but subbed the sides for the sides of the sea scallops. I cleaned my plate it was amazing. Wine selection is fantastic and the salted caramel pudding is not to be missed. I'm so impressed and will make sure any one visiting downtown Phoenix should check this place out."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Eclectic decor and a really fun menu. Good vegetarian options with generous portions for the price. Next time I'm in the area I'll be certain to stop here!"}
{"text":"Our first stop in a wild bachelor party weekend around the Phoenix area. After doing some research for lunch I decided on the arrogant butcher. What a great name for a restaurant located in downtown Phoenix directly across from the Arizona Diamondbacks ball park. With a solid 4 stars and over 1200 reviews it had to be outstanding right? Unfortunately the arrogance overcame the actual experience that we received. Arriving during happy hour the restaurant was extremely dead, but spring break, vacations etc, I'm sure it's normal in Phoenix. The service was just ok, the server seemed to take forever for our drinks, food and even the check. The drinks were watered down and not mixed right, one tasted like vodka and my second was more tonic/cloudy. The food was also just ok, the oysters were terrible, burger average and the best dish by far was the pork nachos. I'm sure this place is outstanding and it was an off day. I'd give it a try again maybe for dinner then next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a draft beer or well drink for happy hour.  I like the fact that these are one of the few spots that start happy hour at 3pm in case you're antsy for an afternoon beverage.  Great atmosphere and patio area.  It is in the heart of downtown Phoenix so it brings in a solid crowd of professionals."}
{"text":"Didn't eat, had a couple mules and then followed up with a bottle of champagne. The bartender took care of use and includes the Orange juice instead of up charging, that made me very pleased. Hip place and unlike bitter and twisted I was warmly welcomed and taken care of."}
{"text":"The cheese fondue with the little pretzel bites is amazing!!! And so is everything else we've ever ordered here! Seafood, steak, oysters, pork chops, pasta dishes, all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yep! The pretzels and provolone fondue was awesome! We also had the jambalaya which had just the right kick and the Thursday special which was fried chicken. All of it was great.  The atmosphere was fun and parking was easy... there is a parking garage next door."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better sit down lunch options in true downtown Phoenix (South of Van Buren, north of Madison), and a wide-ranging menu that should satisfy most tastes. Inviting bar area, dining room, and patio, with efficient service typical of the Fox Restaurant Group. I've sometimes found the food to be lacking or unbalanced--the \"steak\" salad has a few cubes of steak, or the single-patty hamburger that's about the size of a McDonald's quarter pounder--but overall the food is good, hearty, and in line with the prices charged for the quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend and I were seated pretty fast but we waited 20 minutes and weren't even served water."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar solo (in town for work).  Cool vibe, just the right amount of busy.  Came here after landing both Google & yelp searches for best restaurants in Pheonix.  Ordered a NY Strip at the recommendation of the bartender.  Food was the prime goal, and its was satisfying.  5/5.  Cooked proper and sides were delicious, portion size was 4/5, a small salad would be a good addition.  The bar crowd & bartender's personalities were neutral, 3/5 ...but it's Christmas 5 star review overall"}
{"text":"The first impression was remarkably bad due to the unfortunate actions/attitude of one hostess, but thankfully the evening took a dramatic turn around. The manager, Rachel, was fantastic and made great effort to ensure our experience improved. Our waitress, Celcile, was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and never let a drink go dry. I was extremely impressed with them both. Even the lady who sat us,  Sarah, was very kind and helpful.  The food is on a level of its own. As a party of five we shared the Butchers Choice platter n it was delicious. Id recommend ordering two for a party of six or more. All of our entres were cooked perfectly (chicken stuffed crab highly recommended). The salted caramel pudding was to die for.  Thank you Rachel and Cecile for turning the night around, we will definitely be back!  Victoria"}
{"text":"You must go during happy hour, to get the most bang for your buck! The pretzel fondue is the bomb! I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and they did a great job with service even with how busy they were. Not sure if I would take my daughter there it seems pretty hipster."}
{"text":"Stuffed chicken and blueberry cheesecake mason jar. Enough said. This place is absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great food. I find it a bit loud for good conversation though."}
{"text":"Great service, simple but well rounded menu (seafood, steak, chicken, fish, even meatloaf!, sandwiches, salads, etc.) outdoor seating, nice inside ambiance. I had the salmon, potatoes were amazing and salmon perfectly cooked! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I flew into Phoenix late Saturday morning to visit a girlfriend of mine. Once she picked me up from the airport, off we went to start our weekend of eating and catching up. Our first stop was at The Arrogant Butcher to grab some lunch. Located in downtown Phoenix within walking distance to US Airways Center. We parked in a nearby parking garage for $12 -_-   While you won't find an arrogant butcher at the restaurant, you will find: 1) a hip and stylish atmosphere 2) good food 3) attentive service  Whoever the interior designer is for this space should really receive recognition. I loved everything about it from the floor, to the walls, to the furniture, even the bathroom was awesome. The combination of modern with a slight touch of trendy, vintage, and shabby chic (I clearly can't pinpoint what type of style they were rocking) was very inviting and just plain cool.   The food was good--it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Me and my friend shared THE MARKET SALAD: sweet corn, tomato, asparagus, & local ricotta. I ordered the TURKEY SLOPPY JOE: grilled poblano, pepper jack cheese & turkey with fries. My friend ordered the BEEF SHORT RIB STEW: green chiles, a fried egg on top, and a side of cornbread.   Our salad was crisp and refreshing--easily filling if you order a salad as your entree. My sloppy joe came out alright, nothing to rave about, but the fries were delish and the mini jar of ketchup that came along with my fries was a very nice attention to detail and a nice way to keep the ketchup contained instead of having a glob of it all over my plate. My friend's short rib stew came served to her in a mini Dutch oven: super cute. The stew was really good with chunks of tender short rib mixed in with the runny yolk and fried egg whites. The only thing negative thing about the stew was it was a bit salty. The cornbred was moist and not as gritty as some other cornbreads tend to be.   Our server was extremely attentive. When he found out I was visiting from CA he struck up a quick conversation since he grew up in San Diego.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. Next time I'd like to come back, sit at the bar, and try some of their enticing cocktails."}
{"text":"If someone wants to know why I give so many 5-star ratings, it is because my wife and I usually research on Yelp! before we go anywhere, so we are rarely disappointed.  We chose this one because of the ratings and the downtown proximity to the theatre we were attending that evening.  As we approached the doors, they were thrown open by a very nice young man with a big smile, who introduced himself as Bryan and then led us to our table and said he would be our server.  Before the night was over, we gave him a very large tip because he was absolutely one of the best servers we have ever had:  friendly, warm, made excellent suggestions, and non-intrusive but still attentive.  The meal was totally enjoyable in every way.  We started with the pretzel fondue, a basket of large fresh pretzel balls accompanied by a warm cheese dip kept warm at the table via a tea light in the holder.  Delicious, but filling, and we ended up taking four of them home because we did not want to fill up on them (they were addictive!) and ruin our meal.  My wfie ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich at Bryan's recommendation, and followed his suggestion to add roasted peppers.  That was paired with a fresh garden salad with a tasty champagne vianagrette dressing.  She pronounced it all divine!! As a Southerner, I could not resist the honey-drizzled fried chicken and biscuit, issuing a challenge that it would be as good as we have at home.  It was, and the honey was a nice sweet touch versus the salty fried crust.  The chicken was well cooked and juicy--Bryan said they baked it before frying it.  It was accompanied by a creamy and vinegary cole slaw that was the best I have had on the 2-week plus road trip. We both had a local 20 oz. brew with our meal, my wife chose the Lumberyard Hefe and I finally tried the popular Four Peaks Kiltlifter IPA.  Fine dining very reasonably priced in a casual atmosphere downtown--great start to the night.  Thanks, Bryan.  Thanks to you, we will be back on our next visit to the area."}
{"text":"Me, my husband, and my mother in law came here for dinner tonight. We had a great time and the atmosphere and service were fantastic, but the food in relation to the prices left something to be desired. I teetered between a 3 and a 4 star review, but ultimately decided on 3.  For drinks my husband had the Kiltlifter (on tap), I had the Hefeweizen (on tap), and my mother in law attempted to order Fireball, but apparently they don't carry it. The waitress said it was too obscure, so she ordered a Jim Beam and Coke instead. Overall, the drinks were good, but to be fair, they were easy orders.  For appetizers we got the deviled eggs (3 halves for a total of 1.5 eggs for $3) and pretzels with provolone fondue ($10). Both were absolutely delicious. The price on the eggs was a little steep, but they were very good. On the other hand, the pretzel appetizer was very large and was a surprisingly excellent value. I believe they have it in happy hour for like half price, too. The cheese was delicious and the pretzels were really good. I would definitely recommend.  For the entrees my husband got the prime rib special ($32), I had the New York strip ($36), and my mother in law had the crab stuffed chicken ($23). My husbands prime rib was thick cut and looked incredible, but he said it was a little dry. He said the au jus was really good, though. My mother in laws chicken was not stuffed. It was two fried (but not breaded) and pounded chicken breasts with the crab sandwiched in between. She said it was good, but just not at all what she thought it would be when she read \"stuffed\". My New York strip was really, really good. The meat was excellent, but the accompanying potatoes were really plain. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, though.  For dessert we had the peanut butter cup, which was not a cup at all. It's warm peanut butter mousse with a tiny scoop of chocolate gelato in the middle. It came with two peanut butter cookies on the side. The mousse was excellent, but it needed more gelato to balance it out. We also had the blueberry cheesecake, which was really creamy but not very sweet at all. The sweetness was more in the blueberry compote on top, which I really loved, but it might not be for everyone.    I am not sure we will come back here. It's definitely possible, but we weren't really wowed by anything that would compel us to return. We would likely try one of the many other Phoenix restaurants before returning to see what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Unless raw chicken is your bag, I say skip coming to the Arrogant Butcher.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Chicken for dinner, and the 1st few bites were fine, but when I got to a thicker part of the chicken, the entire inside was fleshy-pink and raw.  We told the waitress and spoke to the manager, and instead of taking that dish off the bill entirely, they discounted our bill by $6.  The dish was $23, so that really did not remedy the situation.  We will definitely not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Arrogant butcher for our 1 year wedding anniversary! We had never been there before and we truly wouldn't have wished anything different about our evening.  Our server Gino was absolutely amazing, he was informative, nice, (Not arrogant like tons of the other comments) and check on us regularly.  We got everything he recommended other than an old fashion because im pregnant and every item of food we received was just amazing.  Another server by the name Kelley overheard us talking about our anniversary and went out of her way to inform Gino, he then took the liberty to go the extra mile and offer us a desert on the house to share.   My husband and I are always hesitant to go to \"expensive\" restaurants because he never leaves full and its just never worth the 100 dollar tab including tip but Arrogant Butcher WAS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!   We share aged cheddar and Cobba meat? I believe that was the name I got the ribs and my husband got the New York Steak and both were top notch.  My husband said the best steak he has had at a restaurant including the keg.   Thanks Arrogant Butcher, Gino, and Kelley for making our 1 year anniversary awesome."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday here with a group of friends. It was okay, the location and decor are great. Lots of fun activities to do around this area."}
{"text":"We love coming here as a family when we're nearby. My son and I look forward to their pretzels every time. I just wish they had more food selection on their happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"-pink drink -freaking amazing. I want to copy this for my wedding! It is tart and sweet. -fig drink - also delish -******** fried chicken-omg good!!! ******** I think they only serve this on Wednesdays, but you need to get it. It's like maple fried heaven. Best fried chicken I have ever had.  -crab stuffed chicken- acceptable,    so-so, wouldn't order again -candlestick maker drink: ok  -beef stew ok, would get again. -yellow fin was ok (the hubby liked, me    not much) -pretzel bites n fondue cheese holy    yum!!! Get this as your appetizer before you get the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Best god damn appetizers this side of the Phoenix. They had modelo on the cheap, reminded me of home, got warm & nostalgic. Bathrooms were cool, had some jambalaya.that was spicy in all the right ways. Home girl had the stew, home boy had the oysters. I'm allergic to oysters (I know I'm missing out n shit w e) so I couldn't be objective about that portion of the dining experience but from the reaction of my boy I'd say they were bomb af . Left in high spirits. 10/10 Anderson"}
{"text":"Second time trying out a restaurant at Cityscape and first time at a Fox concept restaurant.  Verdict: 4 stars.  This is an upscale bar type of American restaurant that serves many dishes only found in upper end restaurants.  A variety of cheese, fondue appetizers, excellent artichoke hummus, raw oysters, and main entrees ranging from jambalaya, short rib beef stew, sweet potato raviolis and cioppino specials.  I personally did not order a main entree, but my friends did and they all looked amazing.  I had their pastrami sandwich with handcut fries, which I thought was amazing from the sesame seed bun to the meat.  Blueberry cheesecake was good as well!  Decor was modern and had all kinds of seating, anything from the bar to booths to regular tables.  We had a very knowledgeable waiter as well and he sure knew how to upsell.  It is a fairly pricey place, but you do get what you pay for.  Reservations are recommended, especially on a game night if you want a table."}
{"text":"Kind staff. Amazing fish and chips. The stew was great but one should be warned of how spicy it is. If you are sensitive to heat - beware ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to come here for years, so before a concert we finally decided to give it a try. To sum it up, it definitely lives up it's namesake of Arrogant. We were stuffed next to another couple in basically a doorway-so close you would think we were all together. That turned out to be ok as we chatted it up with them while waiting for service. I watched a waited scurry around and roll his eyes multiple times, and of course he turned out to be our waiter. He seemed very uninterested and didn't seem enthusiastic about...well anything really. The couple next to us said he was quite rude to them as well. We ordered a couple old fashions, which were delicious, but because the vibe was so unfriendly we decided to just get a charcuterie board and leave. The board took quite a while, but it was tasty. We got our check and went across the street for our dinner. We usually do eat at pricey places for date night, but the pretentious service just made it not worth it."}
{"text":"It's fine. It really is. However, I'm not blown away by the place.  First, I am really confused by the raw bar situation. It's summer. In the desert.  I may be a seafood snob having lived on the east coast a long time, but damn, there is no water anywhere near and these people are sserving up raw oysters in July.  Ya don't eat oysters if there isn't an \"R\" in the month; and in the South , March/April are still shady months to eat them.  Um, no.  I ordered the \"Famous Chinese chicken salad\".  I'm not sure why it's famous because it's flavorless.  To me, Asian based salads as such should have more of a peanut presence. Nada.  No seseme, peanut, cilantro. It was rather bland. Fresh, but bland.  I did enjoy the meat/cheese board appetizer.   I love Fox restaurants, but I have to say , based on my one experience it was just so so.  I'd give it another try, however.  My service was impeccable, the food was fresh; but perhaps I ordered wrong. (not as wrong as people who eat oysters in the desert in July though)"}
{"text":"My two daughters and I went to The Arrogant Butcher for lunch yesterday. We sat at a booth inside. I love the decor, vibe, energy of this restaurant. Not a great selection of beers on tap but they were very cold and well priced! Staff were very friendly and accommodating. We ordered the pretzels with cheese fondue for an appetizer. Delicious and fun! I ordered the smoked chicken Waldorf salad which was a little over dressed but the chicken had a great smoky flavor to it. Not too smoky which was nice. The fish and chips were amazing according to my daughter so I had to try a bite. I have to agree with her! My other daughter ordered the french dip and she was really happy with it. I would love to give this restaurant e 5 stars except for two things: the salad, and the fact that our food was brought out too soon after getting the appetizer. Otherwise, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is freaking delicious. I live for Fridays and my wife recognizing Lent. Seriously, It's worth the trip, the money everything."}
{"text":"Would have only given it 4 stars but the management went so above and beyond for us that it earned the 5th one!  We were seated and then waited... and waited... and waited. It was  Friday night and it was busy. After about 15 minutes of no one coming over to even take our drink order we flagged down the hostess, who was mortified and immediately found our server, who gave us our first round of drinks on the house and was extremely apologetic. Then later the manager even came over to apologize and make sure we had gotten our free drinks. Classy move, Arrogant Butcher. Super classy move.  The food was good. I had the salmon which was delicious! - prices can add up quickly with the drinks. Was a great dinner for our short trip to Phoenix, but you could tell it was not a place the locals go to eat. Had a more touristy vibe. Would come back here again and definitely recommend to anyone traveling in the area!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is prime, and they have so many fun cocktails to choose from. I sat at the bar and got the daily special charcuterie board which was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Solid happy hour spot in Phoenix. The smoked carnitas nachos were delicious and huge, and a steal for $7 during happy hour. The smoked shredded pork was full of flavor, and the white bean puree was insanely good. The nachos were also piled high with avocado, pico, and sour cream. I drank \"The Mule\" to wash down the nachos, which was really refreshing. It had vodka, ginger, lime, and club soda. For $5 you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Poorly executed and overrated. Steak tasting of natural gas was served cold, without a steak knife. The wait staff tried hard, but was poorly trained. Simple service requests were met about 50% of the time. Please go somewhere elsewhere else. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Really bad food and even worse service. I ordered  the most expensive filet they had and it came cooked wrong and literally falling apart from all the fat on those meat. I have had many, many pieces of filet mignon and I don't know what the hell that was. So I ordered something eles it still sucked.   So disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't have a big review for this place cause I only stopped in for a couple drinks one night after a suns game, but the atmosphere definitely made me want to return for a meal."}
{"text":"Just delicious. I'm a low carb diet so they were able to switch the mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf entree with Brussels sprouts. Very accommodating. Came during the final four weekend so they rolled out a selective menu.  we're planning to come back during non- event days to see their full extensive menu."}
{"text":"Had my daughters champagne brunch Bridal Shower at The Arrogant Butcher yesterday and it was PERFECT.  From all the planning that was done by Kristy (including the cutest printed menus), the fabulous food by Chef Matt and the great service by Kelly.  All had a great time and didn't want to leave!!!    Thank you all so very much for making the day soooo special."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends last night.  It was delicious.  I feel like it's not the best bargain...but the quality is very good, and last night our service was top notch.  The Sweet Potato Tortelli is wonderful as well as the Jambalaya.  Love the location too!"}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed! Maybe my expectations were too high. I felt like for the quality of food and the small portions, it was expensive. I had the pink drink it was delicious. I also had the crab stuffed chicken. It was not served with anything. It was DRY and way over cooked. My husband had steak- he said it was fine. We had the pretzels for an appetizer! They were good and probably the best part of dinner.It was also quite annoying that the sound system kept having feedback issues and scaring us... It's like your deep in conversation then there is a loud blaring noise on the speaker. The experience was fine it was not bad! But I would not go back either."}
{"text":"I had the kale and Salmon salad. The Salmon is served chopped in pieces and served in the salad, but I requested the whole salmon instead. It was delish!"}
{"text":"I have to give credit for the ambience and location.  Service teetered on the edge but no real gaffes given our group's laid back attitude. Also, we had extra time and were not made to feel rushed. Had we been on a schedule we may have felt differently.   Zuccini fritters and pretzel fondue were tasty and worth it. My wife and mother-in-law shared the pastrami on roll and remarked positively.  Mine and my son's burger patty was shriveled and crisp around the edges. Definitely did not look like the pictures online, but more like a backyard BBQ mistake. Cole slaw was good.   We are Midwestern non-complainers so will not send back a meal unless bugs are crawling out. But I do believe it's important for the restaurant and consumers to know what's happening.   Improve the service and standardize the cooking. We may return because your decor and outdoor seating create a lot of potential!"}
{"text":"Alas Sam Fox has opened a business downtown & I wasn't disappointed at all.   The patio's great but it's starting to get warm (imagine that) so me & my friend grabbed a seat inside near the bar. Love the exposed ceilings & overall feel of the lounge area.   Had the Raspberry Mojito (not the best I've had but still pretty good) to start off with....switched to the Sun Up beer...awesome suggestion from our server.   The apple & beet salad was yummy! A great sized portion & really flavorful.   Service was great...our waiter was really friendly & super attentive.   Can't wait to get back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! The tomato bisque, sweet potato tortellini and hot chocolate cake were delicious! Also, the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to get to Arrogant Butcher for a while and finally ended up here on Saturday night. First let me say, we were about 20 minutes late for our reservation and they got us in RIGHT AWAY. No complaints here. I was fairly shocked that they were able to accomodate that..very pleasantly surprised. Next, our waiter (I wish I could recall his name...) was seriously EXCELLENT. We told him we had never been here before and he told us all about the menu, what he recommends..etc. He was very prompt and attentive..always made sure our glasses were full and we were happy. I have nothing bad to say about him :) So we ordered chicken fingers for my daughter (I know this is not a kid friendly place but we were headed downtown to suffer through Disney On Ice for her so this was the least she could do for us..right?!!) and they were SO GOOD. Their batter was nothing like other chicken strips...I would definitely get these next time I am here. My mother in law got the Sweet Potato Tortellini which she loved..she did say it was a small portion for what it costs but she enjoys small portions so this was no big deal to her. My husband got the Chicken Stroganoff, he said it was \"good\" not great but \"good\". Now, I got the daily sepcial which was the Prime Rib...I ordered it Medium Rare which it definitely was and I can not complain about that...however, not only was my PR not warm..my scalloped potatoes were barely even lukewarm. So, I get that Medium rare PR will not be hot but my potatoes...it felt like mine was sitting under a lamp for a long time waiting for my 2 yr old's chicken fingers to be done since they were inedible for about 10 minutes. All in all, I would say we were pretty pleased by the restaurant. It is very cool inside and had a great feel. I dont know that my PR was worth the $25 it cost. But, I would come back to sit at the bar and have a drink/apps with the husband minus the two year old :)"}
{"text":"The Grilled Chicken Tabouleh Salad and the Pretzel Fondue Appetizer are excellent.  The service was also excllent.  The outdoor patio is a rare treat in the downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I had to cocktails recommended to me by the waitress. Both were excellent, if a bit pricey. The oysters were tasty, especially with the horseradish sauce. The fish tacos were a litte soggy, but the flavor was good. The caramel pudding was perfection!"}
{"text":"Ate here while in town for spring training...it was fabulous. I had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop. Both were great. Good service. Great location and fun vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We were a large group on a busy Saturday night. They didn't have a reservation available for our group, but some smooth talking and a tip got us a table.  We had a personable (and cute) waiter who was happy to go through the menu and make recommendations. He also wanted to make sure that we weren't in a hurry. We weren't (which turned out to be a good thing).  I started with the \"Old Old Fashioned\" cocktail ($11), a very traditional blend of Angel's Envy Reserve bourbon and angostura with orange and lemon peel. Other tried \"The Pink Drink\" ($9) -- vodka, grand mariner, lemon sour, and cranberry bitters -- which was pronounced \"quite sweet.\" The Arrogant 85 ($9) was a surprisingly refreshing combination of gin, aperol, St. Germain, and sparkling wine, served in a champagne glass. It was a nice combination for a warm Phoenix evening.  On the appetizers menu, we tried the house soft pretzels and provolone fondue ($10)  -- round-shaped pretzel bread to dip into the smooth, rich cheese sauce that were a hit with everyone at the table. The zucchini fritters ($8) were light and fluffy and the parmesan aioli was a perfect salty/creamy addition.  My entree was the beef short rib stew ($18), made with plenty of green chiles and white beans, served with a knob of cornbread for crumbling into the spicy, flavorful broth. The stew was topped with a fried egg which added creaminess and texture into the stew.  My sweetie got the Sweet Potato Tortelli ($15), made with mushrooms, spinach, and hazelnuts in a butter sauce. He added a blacked chicken breast to make it a hearty, rich meal.  Other favorites at the table were the scallops ($25), served with bacon-wrapped sweet potato, peas, and marcona almonds in a brown butter vinaigrette, a petite portion but full of flavor. The steaks ($36 for the filet and $35 for the New York Strip) were prepared traditionally and given a thumbs-up.  The warm peanut butter cup dessert ($6) was almost a sweet peanut butter soup, served with a scoop of chocolate gelato in the center of the bowl with two cookies alongside. The Salted Caramel pudding ($6) was ridiculously rich and delicious...and tasted of nothing but salted caramel. Fabulous.  The service was friendly throughout and our waiter was even able to handle separate checks on the big group. That said, it was an hour from the time we were seated until our entrees came out -- clearly the kitchen was having some difficulties. But our waiter did warn us of this up front...and when our food did arrive, it was all warm and delicious.  I'm happy to recommend this as a great spot in downtown Phoenix. Just don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I made a reservation days in advance for NYE, when we got there we were seated at the back of the restaurant. Our first server who was a tall brunette, she was awesome. Then a blonde came to get our order, she was very rude when i asked for no mushrooms on my strip. \"Is that a allergy or just some preference?\" excuse the hell out of me? I worked in the restaurant business and never asked my customer that. You should simply agree and smile. She then gave my boyfriend the same attitude.... Our food came, it was pretty good. I was cutting my steak with the butter knife provided, she then came and pretty much slammed down a steak knife and said \"Here is a steak knife\" and proceeded to storm off.  We watched her with other customers and she seemed fine with the one paying big bucks for appetizers and drinks, sorry that we were on a budget for new years.  I just really didn't appreciate how we were treated.  Probably wont be returning for another meal there which is a shame."}
{"text":"Food was very good here.   I had the   Deviled eggs -- taste of smoked prosciutto, layered creamy with truffle oil  Green Goddess salad -- my favorite part of the meal.  Slightly bitter and fresh with kale and dill.  The asparagus added a nice crunch and the dressing provided the sour and salty vinaigrette that brought all the components together. Very nice complement to the richer parts of the meal.  Short rib stew -- rich and hearty;  cornbread was the bomb. Mix in and break up the egg on top before you start.  Blueberry cheesecake -- nice and fluffy.  Sweet ending."}
{"text":"Somehow I've always been disinterested in Fox restaurants, expecting a chain-restaurant experience.  Unlike your neighborhood Applebee's, Arrogant Butcher feels like a cool hangout spot It's caddy corner to US Airways stadium, go Suns! Huge patio, great for kickin back. The decor is really amusing with lots of hidden treasures, like hoop skirts turned into lamps.  I love me a signature cocktail and they've got a nice handful of special sippings. Cheers to that!"}
{"text":"Good - the food was fantastic (bbq chicken, stew, kale sAlad). The cornbread was some of the best I've ever had. The restaurant decor was nice and the outdoor seating area had heat lamps. O ur server Jonathan was a nice guy. He knew the menu well.  Bad -  jonathan was extremely inattentive. No refills on water (I literally had to track him down to ask for refills), he didn't take the appetizer plates off the table or clear any plates, and we also had to walk up to ask for the check."}
{"text":"We chose this place because of the name. It's an attention grabber. It's a cool place, I'll give it that. The restaurant has an industrial feel, good bar, and they had awesome design work. Most entrées were about $20.  I ordered crab stuffed chicken, which seemed a little healthier than some of the fried foods on the menu and it ended up being two fried chicken breasts with a crab mix in between them. It looked good but was full of celery, which I'm seriously allergic to, so my mom ended up taking half my dinner off the plate to keep me from puffing up like a blowfish. This was partly my fault, because by now I really know better to ask about celery in things, but I had been expecting just... Lump crab with chicken. So basically I just ate a breaded piece of fried chicken with spinach.  My mom had a steak that was tough, and she didn't eat much, though my sister had a filet that she scarfed down before I could even try. Dad had fish and chips that were okay.  All the waiters seemed happy and outgoing, ours was around just enough to make sure we were never out of drinks but didn't hover, brought us our check quickly. He knew the menu and scored major points with me when he wiped the table after our fondu left the table messy. My mom mentioned her steak problem and the manager came and talked with us.  I left disappointed. I'll admit I had high expectations going in there, so maybe I just expected too much. If I really couldn't think of anywhere else to go, I'd give it another shot. The menu is a little out there (sweet potato ravioli and pan cooked apples and lots of horseradish things), I don't remember seeing a kid menu so if you have picky eaters this might be a pass for you."}
{"text":"This place is great. I absolutely love it!!! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice!!"}
{"text":"Went for my anniversary. The service was awesome. The appetizers were pretty good as well.. I don't even like pretzels but I would recommend theirs. The entrees were good as well. A nice drink selection is available as well. The only thing that I didn't care for was the location (downtown parking sucks) no knocks on the restaurant. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"The BEST Long Island Iced Teas you will ever have! More vegetarian options would be much appreciated."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher is always hit or miss for me. I've visited a handful of times now. The food and drinks have always been stellar. It's the service and timing that can be off.   Overall, an okay place but never anywhere I'm overly excited to visit."}
{"text":"This was great...my husband had the double cheese burger and I had the jambalaya very good....the house made bun, was the perfect touch for the perfectly cooked med rate burger. The jambalaya was full of fresh okra (not slimy), red n green bell peppers, onions, chicken and sausage. Piping hot and delicious ...if u need more sauce for your jambalaya just ask for it, our server Steve was wonderful, knew everything about the menu!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite, but still very good. We've had really good service for the most part and this is a great place to go if you need a nice restaurant to go to before a game or concert since it's so close to the stadium. Fox Restaurants always do a great job."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business lunch in which we took our clients here.  The food was great and the staff was great.  The menu had lots of options and they had a nice drink menu too.  The next time that I am in town we will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"The service was TOP notch! Matt took very good care of us. Our party of 4 shared the appetizer platter and the pretzel bites. I could have made a meal of the bites alone! I had the stew....do your tummy a favor! The drinks were cold and the place is beautiful! It's a MUST when in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a drink or something to eat.  Turkey Pastrami sandwich is what I tend to get. Or some pretzels if I am just here to drink a bit....they give you a ton - you'll need help. Drink selection is decent."}
{"text":"Place is okay. Nothing great. Sort of reminds me of Red Robin. Downtown location was full at lunch time. Service  was good. Still, I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Thursday night and really enjoyed the experience.  There were so many things to choose from that sounded good, and based on our experience, we will have to go back to try more, as we were very happy with what we selected.  We also shared our meals so both had the opportunity to try more.  We started with a little tray of grilled asparagus and olives and cheddar cheese that was served with crusty bread and delicious jam.  We shared the scallops, which were very well prepared and flavorful, and the New York strip steak that was served with an amazing horseradish sauce.  The food was amazing and the service was totally up to par.  We opted to sit out on the patio, which was also very enjoyable.  Can't wait to come back, though seeing as I reside in Los Angeles, it will be a while!"}
{"text":"The best prime rib I've ever had. Outstanding craft beer selection. Would definitely go back. Love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a group of friends in their 20s and 30s. Been there twice within a week. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"11/29/12  3.5 stars... First visit!  Bookmarked this place months ago, and I finally had an excuse to make the trip from North Scottsdale... I'm taking Mom and aunt to see Cirque du Soleil's \"Dralion\" at the US Airways Center!  Thanks to friend and fellow yelper Dolores G.'s helpful info on where to park, I made the decision to choose Cityscape for both the chance to dine at The Arrogant Butcher and have my ticket validated AND take advantage of its proximity to the arena.  She wasn't kidding when she said that US Airways was across the street!  After waiting about 20 or so minutes for first availability, we were seated outside, and my views were of the four-way intersections, pedestrian traffic, and of the front of the arena, which were lovely given that most of my dining experiences have been in strip malls, Old Town Scottsdale, the Biltmore... suburbia.    I was able to sample a couple of reds before settling with a nice glass of Sebastiani cab from Sonoma.  While waiting for our table, we all decided we'd try the Artichoke hummus app http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ#pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ, the Market salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q#p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q, the Beef short rib stew http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA#M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA, and the \"Fish and Chips.\"  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA#aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA  We all loved the artichoke hummus and pita bread app!  The bread was soft, yet had a nice chew, in spite of it not being warm and crispy.  The artichokes had great flavor, especially those that were touching the tomatoes.  We also adored the Market salad, which had so many textures to delight the mouth: mixed grains, chewy cranberries, sweet and crunchy gingersnaps, and creamy ricotta... Mmmm!  Loved the almost-nutty bite of the roasted butternut squash.  I plan to order this again on my next visit!    We also really liked the Beef short rib stew: I liked the smoky flavors of the beef and the green chile peppers, but my favorite were the beans!  Some were still chunky, while the others had tenderized down to almost like a dip you spread on crackers and crostini.  I didn't think the fried egg's presence made much of a difference...  I could take it, or leave it.  Since I couldn't sample the cornbread muffin (allergy), I had some of the fries from the fish entree with the stew, instead.  Mom and aunt enjoyed the crispy fish!  I really loved the batter, which was just the perfect amount to cover the fish and give it a very delightful crunch (and was the dish ever so pretty to look at!).  However, I found the pieces to be very salty, and I couldn't stand more than two or three bites of it.    I think my Mom would very much like to return, and so would I.  :)  I am going to try to make it here earlier for happy hour soon.  I really appreciate the location of Cityscape, its parking garage, and its easy access to many restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues!"}
{"text":"Location was definitely a plus for us. Was a vendor at the Bridal Show and wanted to kill time after the show to wait for traffic to die down, so went in search of food. Gave our name and number at the Host stand. The gal was polite. Not a long wait, and they text you instead of giving you one of their pagers (brilliant, and a cost savings for them). We were seated and waited a long while before a very sweet gal named Kayla approached us. She offered to get us drinks, explained the menu, and said she'd get drinks and our waiter. I guess there was a little confusion  (or no one wanted a 2 top), so she came back and said that she'd be our server.   She helped us pick dinner, we were both torn between 2 different items. My hubs got the Short Rib Stew and said it was really good (and loved the green Chiles). I was torn between the burger and the Chicken Tabouli, she suggested I get the burger and Chicken Tabouli salad as a side. I am SO glad I did! The burger was 'meh (which surprised me, expected more knowing the name of the restaurant). The Chicken Tabouli salad was FanTasTic! Loaded with Feta cheese and almonds and all sorts of goodness.  Kayla was absolutely wonderful. She was polite, gracious, listened, and made suggestions when we asked. That is hard to find in a server and we appreciated it!  Yes I'd go again. No I wouldn't bother with the burger (Smash Burger is way better)  Yes I'd get the Chicken Tabouli salad again!"}
{"text":"Maybe we could write a book report on the wine.... A server told us in response to our question on a bottle on their list. RED FLAG. Crab legs, very simple... Shreds of crab meat on top of my steak? Not the same. I understand the place is rockin, but c'mon... thank goodness management took over for us."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with this place, it's all in the eye of the beholder. Whether you're cruising in for a casual grub or a fancy date, it's a great spot. Although it can be pricey, I'd recommend swinging by  during HH. It tends to be busy but try and hangout by the bar it's the best seat in the house. You'll enjoy some awesome deals and get the best bang for your buck on some scrumptious food.   *** Must Try ***  * Soft Pretzels w Provolone Fondue $5 * Crispy Shrimp w Shishito Peppers $8 * Toasts - Roasted Red Peppers served up      w Boursin Cheese & Balsamic dressing $4  Beers on Tap are dangerously cheap during HH and they serve the best local brews from  PHX 12 oz mugs $3/ Non local $4 #Winning.  Perfect stop before you hit up a diamondback or suns game!"}
{"text":"Perfect patio to people watch while enjoying a 4 star meal.  The jambalaya was great but a little too spicy.  (And I love spicy.) Good service on a very busy Friday night.  The prices were very reasonable for a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! Downtown has a flagship restaurant. There are many fantastic restaurants downtown, don't get me wrong, but to me, The Arrogant Butcher now reigns supreme.   The service was attentive and friendly, and they all looked sharp in their white shirts and skinny black ties.   I'm a fan of Fox's other restaurants and have always been impressed with the food. I had Toast, which was some kind of bread from heaven covered in brie and apples and something else delicious. Then for 6 bucks I got a beer and a shot of Jim Beam. Best happy hour downtown?? I think so.   The location couldn't be better. The patio is a fantastic addition to downtown streets. Now the city needs to develop those hideous empty lots across the street. Inside is open and airy with some areas for private parties and a huge bar.   I could go on and on about how awesome the Arrogant Butcher is. (How I love the name!!) It's modern, masculine, urban, unique, and such a welcome addition to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"The prime rib was excellent, cooked perfect and seasoned nicely. The horseradish  was good, they  have  two kinds a spicy or a creamy. Both were better than the au jus. The scalloped potatoes were creamy and cheesy, no hard parts just really good. The waitress was absolutely  awesome, Kayla- she did an excellent job. The beer's on tap were  plentiful and good. This place is worth going to, right near the Chase Field (baseball ) and U.S. Airways Arena ( basketball )."}
{"text":"Let me just say- I was SO looking forward to coming here so I'm disappointed about my review.   Atmosphere is cool! Okay sized bar (about 16 seats), good music, staff was very friendly and attentive.   I came during happy hour and got their mule. It was really great and $5- can't beat that!   I ordered the pretzels and provolone cheese dip. The pretzel bites were bigger than I expected and they gave me about a dozen. The portion was way more than what I was expecting, especially for a happy hour app. The cheese dip came over a tea light so it stayed hot which is awesome. But. The cheese dip had no taste! I was actually worried it'd be too strong, I'm not a huge fan of provolone. I wish they had mixed in some cheddar to give it a bolder taste.   I also ordered the sweet potato tortellini with chicken as my meal. The tortellini was very al-dente and the sweet potato flavor wasn't very strong. The chicken seemed to be pre-cooked little cubes like you'd find in a salad kit. But the mushrooms were good, definitely the highlight of the dish. The sauce wasn't quite a wine sauce, wasn't quite a cream sauce and it also had no flavor. All in all, and it kills me to say this- it was very similar to a pasta dish you'd find in a college dining hall."}
{"text":"The bf and I just moved to downtown Phoenix and so far the food has just been \"meh\". We went here last night and it was incredibly busy. But our server, Anne, was amazing. Super attentive, friendly, and she recommended my new favorite beer - San Tan's Mr. Pineapple. Good lord that beer was good.  I had the fish and chips with coleslaw and my bf had the new york strip. All of it was incredibly tasty and well done. Anne later came by at the end of the meal and gave us some tips for when we dine there in the future since we're definitely going to become regulars.   Overall: Food - 4 stars. Server - 5 stars. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I've really tried to like this place.  Great location and they have plenty of mouthwatering items on the menu.    During my two visits it was extremely busy and even with a reservation, we still waited 30 minutes for a table - Issue 1. Issue 2 - this place has terrible staff. The bartenders and hostesses are rude and yes, I understand you are busy...but you can still smile and be nice!  I'm paying to be treated like crap?!? Bah...  After visiting the place twice for dinner I can say that the pretzel fondue is quite good.  I also liked the short rib dish as well as the crab stuffed chicken.  They are certainly onto something with the food, prices are so/so.  The wine options by the glass aren't very good and spendy for the quality that you get.  Besides, opting for a dirti 'tini makes the bar service a wee bit bearable.  I really, really wanted to like this place, but alas, it's another fantasitc idea that is executed sadly in poor downtown Phoenix.  Maybe some of the other options coming to CityScape this fall will fare better?  A girl can dream, can't she?"}
{"text":"Brought in 3 of my kids and we had a yummy lunch after the symphony. The boys loved their HUGE kids burger. The pretzels and cheese appetizer were delicious. The only reason I am not giving them 5 starts is the drinks cost $4 each! Tea, lemonade and 2 sodas.Crazy. We will get waters next time."}
{"text":"Place is okay. Always feel like people here always think they are better than everyone else. Food is overpriced"}
{"text":"Have some money to spend on a great meal? Come here. The wait staff truly yours above and beyond to make your stay meaningful. I ordered the filet and it was phenomenal. I also got the zucchini fritters which were interesting. The drinks are creative as well!"}
{"text":"Our first time eating at The Arrogant Butcher and we are big foodies who travel and go to all restaurants overseas and in USA. Based off reviews I thought it was a no brainer.  The food definitely not impressed.  The hostess staff was extremely friendly and very helpful when making my reservation. The waiter not so great. My hubby ordered me a glass of wine while I was in the rest room. Glass came But no wine in  or carafe until around 5 minutes or so later. Very odd.  He ordered app of crispy shrimp and we must have waited more than 20 minutes. People around us who were seated way after us had their apps sooner. Our waiter came back because he saw us looking at him and he said he would check on it, but he never came back. Finally he brought them piping hot, but honestly they were not so great and a little overcooked. When shrimp are overcooked they are chewy. Some were definitely chewy.  My husband ordered a cheese burger fries and coleslaw. They made it a double patty but hardly any cheese. The coleslaw was filled with vinegar and way too much mayonnaise.It was terrible and tart.    I ordered the Diver seared scallops with Brussel sprouts and sweet potatos,  It was so very salted that my tongue burned all night at concert I went too.The scallops were poorly seared since they only seared one side. The dish was not cheap so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts were also EXTREMELY salted. Glad I had the potatoes since that helped break the salt. I couldn't drink enough water.   We had a 2 1/2 hour drive and were very hungry she we arrived so I ate it anyway. My husband hardly finished his burger-didn't eat slaw at all. We did not want to complain, but a nice lady asked how it was since my husband had a plate full of food leftover. He did express his opinion and they took the appetizer off the bill which was nice, but the bill still was $60 before tip.  Will not be eating here again even though the staff was nice-food was definitely not worth three $$$ dollar signs. I expected much more."}
{"text":"Confused is the word that describes the service here. Every time we asked a question, the first person we asked had no answer so they got \"the manager\" of which they seem to have a lot. We were ignored for a long time, then when a server came, she seemed surprised to see us. The back room was noisy and they had a TV tuned to the Amazing Race--so annoying. When I asked them to turn it to something that wouldn't kill my brain cells or to turn it off, they put on ESPN news--not a game. The meat and cheese platter was very good. My husband and son had steaks which they said were average. I had the pork and beans which were really good, but overpriced. The peanut butter cup was \"to-die-for!\" Every one of their desserts had nuts in them and my son  is allergic to all tree nuts, so nothing for him. The wines were way overpriced and they had no dessert wines or after-dinner drinks. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Having dined at several other Fox Restaurant Concept locations, I was really hoping for an amazing experience. Unfortunately, The Arrogant Butcher fell short. There was a small wait for a table despite several tables being open. Once seated we were greeted fairly quickly. Our drinks arrived promptly but that was where it ended. I was able to finish my glass of wine before our order was taken. We ordered some charcuterie and two entrees. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer! It was meat, cheese, and some accompaniments. Really? From our seat I could see that the kitchen looked completely disorganized. I witnessed several servers pulling managers aside to resolve issues and the table behind us had complaints as well. Our entrees arrived while we were still eating our first course. They were hot but the dark meat chicken in the jambalaya was dry. How on earth do you end up with dry dark meat? The scallops were also well done. After waiting that long we didn't bother to address it with our server. It seems like there is a lot of potential there but I cannot say we will be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"My burger was well-prepared.  I sincerely appreciate when my meat is cooked to the actual state of \"doneness\" that I request.  It is an ironically \"rare,\" but magical thing, when \"medium rare\" arrives in front of me (I know you saw what I just did).  The ingredients were all fresh and it was a satisfying meal.  The service was sincerely attentive, though slow, however it was a large party and it was at the height of lunch hour.  We may have gone elsewhere had we known our lunch would take as long as it did.  Still, a good option for downtown."}
{"text":"This is a must try put it on your to do list now the food is terrific a down town experience. Great place to check out worth the drive for this dinning experience.."}
{"text":"Ate here around 3pm on a Tuesday and felt like we had the place to ourselves. Started with the beet salad which was easily the best I've ever had. Lettuce was crisp, flavors and textures blended perfectly, a big hit for sure. Shared the beef short rib stew and turkey pastrami sandwich, both were delicious. Finished the meal off with the warm peanut butter cup which was basically a peanut butter soup with peanut butter cookies on the side. Not my favorite but not bad either. We told our server Kelly that it was our first time to the restaurant and she treated us like royalty. Was very impressed by her thorough description of menu items and attentiveness."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We tried the turkey pastrami, the short rib stew, the ribs, the turkey sloppy joe, the oysters, the pretzel fondue, and the hummus. Everything was fantastic. We are New Yorkers in for a conference and we were all raving about the food. Highly recommended. Drinks were good too."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch/early dinner after Bad Voodoo Daddy concert. We split the zucchini fritters - yummy. I had the Brussel Sprout Caesar - it was good, I wish the sprouts had been shaved instead of just cut in half.My husband had a green salad. His entire was the meatloaf - very nice, the tomato sauce on top was almost sweet. I had the crab stuffed chicken, which is 2 breaded and grilled boneless breasts with crab meat between really good. No room for desert. Blake was very friendly and perfectly attentive. And a bit into jazz."}
{"text":"My law school dean came to Phoenix and hosted me to TAB... food and drinks were good... and the crowd was lively."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant during my 23 hour visit to Phoenix/Tempe area for an ASU visit. Great atmosphere, I ate outside on the patio to soak up the \"warm\" 70 degree night. I came here for dinner and got the turkey sloppy joe- tasty but a little dry. For dessert I got the peanut butter gelato/cookie combo and it was to die for. Waitress did try to push the charcuterie plate (what they're \"known for\") but didn't seem appetizing at the time. Great place to stop  by if you're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Good, fast service. The bar tender is the young guy but pretty professional. It was a hot day so a beer is all I could have.  We ordered the scallops also. They were done just right. Nice and crispy on the outside. Soft and NOT chewy on the inside. The corn mash was great.  The presentation I thought was 5 starts. Flavor 4. Service 4.  Good job!"}
{"text":"The fondue wasn't very cheesy, but the portion was huge. The fitters were ok. The sloppy joe was great. The stew was good. Desert made the meal. The peanut butter cup was stellar. The hot chocolate cake was tasty and moist as well. I would go back just for the desert! My wife and daughter agree!!"}
{"text":"I do not often find a restaurant while I'm traveling that I want to visit more than once. This is the exception. I'm going to start with dessert first - you will miss out on life if you do not save room for either the Salted Caramel Pudding (we added green apple slices which put it over the top) and we had the cheesecake 3 times. Today, we had dessert for lunch. On the menu side, we had the grilled fish tacos, salmon, and sea bass; all of which were divine. Another not to be missed is the hummus - it was the best we have ever had!  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The service was great but really disappointed in the sea bass. Bland and way too expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"What a great treat for a date night.  Started off with the prosciutto deviled eggs and boy were they awesome. Super creamy yellow with truffle oil blended in for the final touch. Entree we had Meatloaf and the AB Cheeseburger.  With the meatloaf they made sure the meat was start of the show. Super tender and a great blend of meat/veggies.  Mashed potatoes were nice and creamy with a light gravy in the middle.  The cheeseburger had a sharp but not sour flavor.  Burger was cooked to perfection but was a little undersized for the bun. However the bun was delicious.    Will come back again to try more. You won't be disappointed you came."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up. Great good, atmosphere, wait staff, and a definite return. Tough to figure out the parking there though so be prepared to drive around a bit or get lost coming and going from the underground lots. It's very near the basketball stadium so definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere, great food, good portion sizes, and fantastic service.  My drink was never empty for long.  There was a mixup with our fondue, so it was comped without us having to ask.  The fondue was fantastic.  My wife had the pork and beans and she loved it.  The collard greens were tender and cooked to take on the flavor of the pork.  I had the baby back ribs which were tender and had a great smokey flavor without being too sweet.  We finished our meal with a peanut butter cup.  The mouse was so sweet that the gelato almost tasted bitter!  A fantastic dessert, like nothing I've ever had.  I will try the hot chocolate cake next.  We left satisfied, but not painfully full."}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor seating for the lovely warm weather.   Friendly service and I had a nice dining.    I had the beef short rib stew with a runny egg on top and it hit the comfort spot.  I must say that it's the best cornbread that I've ever had that was with the homely stew.  The cornbread was perfectly crusty on top with warm, buttery goodness, lovingly soft on the inside and simply treasurable!  It was fitting as an evening arrival in downtown.   Iced tea was point on and refreshing for the warm weather.    I think the raw oysters could have been better.  It had that taste of maybe sitting there for awhile and not fresh.  Phoenix isn't near the sea so don't expect it that it is conveniently from the sea.  Do get the meat dishes!    They have artisanal charcuterie and fine meat entrees.  I was pondering over the meatloaf or crab stuffed chicken!  Both sounded special and mightily appealing!  Decided on the stew because I wanted something homely.  Spacious dining and nice outdoor area."}
{"text":"Food was a five the jambulia was really good with a lot of chicken, shrimp and sausage.  Atmosphere was really good as well as the service.  Unfortunately I had a bone in my meal and it was a bit disappointing.  I still would recommend just watch your bites."}
{"text":"A nice place for happy hour!  After watching a lovely show at The Orpheum, we were feeling quite peckish, so we headed over to partake in the discounted delectables that The Arrogant Butcher had to offer.  I also just wanted to eat here because I dig the name Arrogant Butcher. From 3-6 PM they offer appetizers such as pretzels with cheese fondue ($5), fried shrimp with shishito peppers ($8), and artichoke hummus ($8).  They also have a decent selection of mixed drinks, wine, and beer at a reasonable price for happy hour.  We indulged in all the appetizers described above, and left with full and satisfied stomachs.  The pretzels came in a big basket, and are pretty much like the pretzels you will find at Culinary Dropout.  They are fairly large, doughy nuggets, and go well with the cheese fondue (It tasted like some type of cheddar concoction). The fondue was good, but a little grainy.  The shrimp were nicely cooked, and had a nice tender texture to go with the crunch of the light batter.  The shishito peppers were good as well, and were mild in heat.  The hummus was a very nice presentation, and had a wonderful array of textures and flavors, from the smooth, almost creamy hummus, to the pieces of artichoke, olive, tomato, and sweet red pepper.  The pita bread that was served with it was grilled, with a pillowy center.    Service was decent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Definitely a good spot to eat at if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Went on a Wed. Night. Crowded, noisy but enjoyable. We went in without a reservation at around 5:30-6 and were told that it would be at least 20-30 minutes. Since we were heading for an event we decided to eat at the bar. The bartenders were great, service great , food was good and quick. Wife had fish tacos (only 2), at $16. I had Short Rib Stew at $18, excellent except for the portion. The portions, in our mind, seemed a little small for the price. Normally, I would never complain about the size except when the price doesn't fit what your getting. Happy hour drinks: good! If you don't mind the noise than this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"I like the vibe of the place a lot, it's nice, but relaxed at the same time.  The food was decent, but I liked the setup of the place.  it's good enough to take guests to, and you're also able to have lively conversation at the same time, without worrying that you're being to loud.   Tip: Go to Costco and get a gift card; Costco usually has gift cards at a discount, and you can save money that way."}
{"text":"Just wanted to try a new place for my birthday and was not disappointed. This place is nestled near the chase field stadium in downtown so be prepared for parking structures.   To start with the decor is very tasteful. I got seated with my party in one of their back rooms and the pictures on the wall were interesting.   Waiters and hostesses were on their game despite how busy it was. Not once did I feel like their wait staff was rude or ignoring our party.  For the food I am inclined to say that the appetizers did not disappoint. I ordered the pretzel bread with fondue and other people got the shrimp and nachos appetizers. None of them were below subpar each had its own unique flavor and look. The cheese especially with the pretzel bread had a soft taste and not overbearing. While the pretzel bread was unevenly salted on some and not other pieces the taste combined with the cheese was still fantastic.  Onto the main entrees, I was able to get the turkey pastrami and the prime rib French dip sandwiches. Both were visually appetizing and both had completely different tastes. The only bad thing I can say is the slight spice of the horse radish was not expected. As I am not a fan of horse radish this did not take away the tasteful meats in both sandwiches.  My number one place for salted caramel pudding now has a new champion. I can say hands down with the many places I have been able to get salted caramel pudding for dessert this is now my number one place. The sweet taste of caramel is neither overbearing nor is it underwhelming. The refreshing caramel taste with the whipped cream was a great balance."}
{"text":"I have been to AB quite a few times in the last few years.  The service has always been outstanding, but the food is WAY too salty. So much so that they should just remove the salt from the tables. Thought the first time with the oversalting of everything was a fluke. Went back a few additional times, tried the same items, and it wasn't a fluke.     Here's the list of menu items we've tried -  House Soft Pretzels and Fondue  Short Rib Stew Filet Mignon Fish and Chips Pastrami Sandwich Salted Caramel Pudding - yes, salted, but still over the top with the salt.   I seriously want to love the food here, but the bloat due to salt that follows after eating here is horrible."}
{"text":"Great local food and drinks. They have a wide variety of food choices to upscale to low key munchies. Great location to chase field. Will definitely be back to try something new on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great space, great for groups and kids.  Parking was a little tricky because there were a lot of events downtown.  Kids loved the pretzels, the burgers platter was delicious.  Only negative was brussels sprout Caesar salad day dent actually have many Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Happy Hour and it was freakin' packed-Standing room only.   The happy hour menu was awesome!  $6 for a beer and shot, $3 pretzels!  The visit was brief, as we just bar-hopping....I cannot wait to go back.  Note:  Upon initially looking at the menu, I was pretty much in shock with $36 Ribeyes.  But upon closer inspection, there are actually some decently priced meals."}
{"text":"Went for my fourth visit to this Phoenix downtown staple. My first visit was a few years ago when I hosted s large group business dinner that was great!  Since then each visit just gets worse. This time a 530 early bite before attending the Symphony. We arrived and the hostesses were great our reservation was ready as arranged. We opted to sit at the bar as spots were available. We ordered a cocktail from a particularly non communicative bartender and asked a few questions about the menu to which we got one line answers. I was having a bad feeling about this. Cocktails came and my partners drink was fabulous. A rum cocktail w muddled fruit that she said was great. We toasted the evening and I noticed that my vodka tonic was not quite right. The tonic mix had run out on the bartenders gun. Hey it happens. The resolution to this small issue ruined the evening. The staff were rude and not helpful They did comp the drink and I did tip appropriately but we left without having dinner and will not return. I cannot imagine how this place stays so busy when we have seen nothing but poor performance on three out of four visits. Oh yes, Location, Location, Location."}
{"text":"Second visit, I will call it an accidental visit as I had no idea that's where we were meeting...Not impressed at all. Mediocre food and not very flavorful.... just not my kind of menu. Got very sick after I got home. And so did my family member. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a 0. My boyfriend and I went here a few months back and it was the day they were having fried chicken. As a chicken lover I decided to order it. I was not only disappointed, but disgusted. I eat out a lot, so I know good chicken when I see it and this was not it. The batter on the chicken was still not cooked through and neither was the chicken. When we told the server they asked if we would like to have it remade and I said no. We ended up only paying for the meal my boyfriend got, but even he did not enjoy his steak. I would not be upset if that was all, this place ended up giving me food poisoning from the two small bites of chicken I had. Save your money and visit a REAL steak house like Mastro's city hall, Flemings, or Steak 44, AND WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Arrogant Butcher for the first time this weekend. I must say we had mixed feelings about it.  The service wasn't stellar and they seemed quite overwhelmed with the crowd, yest there were empty tables all over. There were 4-5 hostesses who couldn't seem to find their rhythm.  The pretzel bites with fondue cheese were amazing but their entree portions were definitely on the small side... I just think for the price, they could do a bit more.  Overall, the food was good, service was \"eh\", price was higher than the value.  Not sure we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for date night prior to a performance. The charcuterie was good, but not worth the price for the measly amount that you get. Both steaks were delicious, but not that big. We had enough room for dessert and tried the caramel pudding. Amazing. All in all it was a wonderful night with a pretty hefty price tag. Steaks and dessert were worth it."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and selection of snacks. We LOVED their charcuterie board! My girlfriend and I came here before the Stevie Nicks concert so it was packed. I'd like to go back when there isn't an event happening."}
{"text":"Talk about a hot spot, this place sure is on the rise. Beautifully decorated restaurant and full of life, with a very accommodating wait staff to boot. Was attracted to the unique menu offerings, like crab stuffed chicken, which was great by the way. Make a reservation, or you'll be eating elsewhere lol"}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic dinner. If you are in downtown Phoenix you should definitely eat here. Everything is 5 stars - service, food, atmosphere. I would definitely suggest making a reservation.   I started with some brie cheese and cherry jam and deviled eggs - both really tasty.   For dinner, I had the scallops. Honestly some of the best I've ever had. And the sweet potatoes w crumbed bacon were delicious too.   For the desert the peanut butter cup was amazing. You have to like peanut butter - but if you do, get this.   Staff was excellent and timing of the food was perfect. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant. My steak was incredibly raw and the food just wasn't that good. Overrated"}
{"text":"I was in town for two nights and their massive  charcuterie board caught my attention so this was our first stop.   Location is very spacious with a romantic/fun ambiance, making it great for date night or for big groups.    Butcher charcuterie - recommend! Comes with so much stuff. Bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, cured meats, bread topped with olive oil, pistachios, cream cheese stuffed peppers, olives, corn bread madelines, deviled eggs, whipped salmon, tapenade something, truffle Brie, and a spicy sauce. So worth it!   Cheeseburger - skip. Ordered this one based on another yelp review and when it came out it was only a patty and bun with fries. They forgot the  veggies and cheese so had to send it back. But burger was very average."}
{"text":"I had never been in before but had heard a lot about it from friends in the area. Finally made it in and was happy to see many of my favorites from the Fox Concepts there. They also have a pretty sweet Happy Hour- with serious deals on drinks and apps.   The ambiance was also great and had a great view of downtown Phx.   I enjoyed my pretzel bites, gin drink and delicious cheddar cheese appetizer!"}
{"text":"Very busy for lunch but I liked the atmosphere.  Our waitress was great!  Not quite what I was expecting - not as red meat heavy or butchery as I thought.  Some unusual flavors didnt hit it with me, like in the devilled eggs or the cuban sandwich. Just a different flavor palate, not for me."}
{"text":"Although I like the food, what really bothers me is how crowded this restaurant always is and how slow and inattentive the waiters are. I expect better service for this prices on the menu."}
{"text":"We got here two hours before the Keith Urban concert and the line was super long. However, we stuck to our plan and waited. It moved pretty quickly and got our table. Menu was pretty short which made it easy to order:) Order came out fast. Save room the for the salted caramel pudding. Your taste buds will thank you :)"}
{"text":"The butchers great if you know what it is and know what your looking for. I love the charcuterie options, many good things there. The raw bar is respectable and the appetizers shine.   I have tried almost every entree and have been dissapointed on each one. They all come out feeling slapped together and poorly seasoned.   For a place thats called the arrogant butcher I'm also surprised not to see more hearty meat dishes. Maybe its a change of the menu when I'm there or maybe its false advertising."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!! If you live anywhere in the greater phoenix or surrounding areas it is worth the drive down town. Parking is free in the parking garage with validation. The food is awesome and the service is great. The staff is super friendly and waits well on their patrons.   We started off with the pate, pineapples, some cheese, and oysters. We shared the kale salad and the crab stuffed chicken and it was superb! My 3 yr old daughter even loved her meal. I'm pleasantly surprised that everything we ate was so well prepared and delicious.  The baseball game had just let out and they were still able to get us seated in a timely manor in a spacious booth that could have easily accommodated a few more guests. Compared to many restaurants that I have been to this place really has it together with a homey and welcoming atmosphere. I have to give the arrogant butcher 5 stars!!! I feel fortunate that the events of the evening had landed us here for a fantastic dinner.  I will happily return here with friends and family in the near future.  Thank you for the fantastic experience and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a drink and had the platter for an app.  It was wonderful and highly recommend it.  My wife and I also thought it was interesting that the staff seemed very happy and engaged.  Great crowd for a Wednesday afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"We came in this weekend and at at the bar For 20min. No on Even made eye contact with us. But I gave Them the benefit, there were 4 of us so we were visible. We went upstairs to tilted kilt"}
{"text":"Not too shabby! I feel like they need a little more variety in their menu. Other then needing at add a little more food options, everything else was wonderful! The food was delicious; the atmosphere was relaxing and fresh. Every single person working had a smile on their face and helped create a friendly atmosphere. When I return to the area I would like to try a few other places, but may come back to try another dish."}
{"text":"arrogant [ar-uh-guhnt] adjective  1. making claims or pretensions to superior importance or rights; overbearingly assuming; insolently proud: an arrogant butcher.  Definitely true when you are here at The Arrogant Butcher!  Let me start with the service... Mark was amazing! Extremely knowledgeable and entertaining, making our experience that much more enjoyable!  The Grub: Started off with the House Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue and Pâté of Foie Gras, Chicken Liver & Black Truffle.  Orgasmic!  Pâté had the perfect blend of ingredients, not too gamy or salty! I could have licked the plate if I didn't mind my manners! The house pretzels were so soft and scrumptious! Having a provolone fondue was the perfect match, light enough to enhance but not over power!  Our entrees consisted of the Beef Short Rib Stew with Green Chiles, Fried Egg & Cornbread and Rock Shrimp, Chicken, Sausage & Okra Jambalaya.  The Beef short rib stew melted in your mouth and the fried egg was like the icing on a cake! Oh and the cornbread...YUM! I wanted to steal it off of my fiancés plate!  The Jambalaya was just as impressive.  If I didn't fill up on the pretzels, pâté and cornbread, I could have cleaned the entire plate!  Ready throw in the towel, Mark recommended we try the blueberry cheesecake! Persuaded by his charm, we gave in! Glad we did because this cheesecake was heavenly, not too sweet and the graham cracker streusel just took it over the top!  My friend and I would be quick regulars here if we lived in AZ!  Requesting Mark's section of course! ;)  We would definitely plan another trip to AZ just to visit the Arrogant Butcher again!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, the pretzel fondue is the best pretzel appetizer dish I've ever had in a restaurant.  No joke.  Wow.  A part of me wishes I lived in Phoenix so I can eat this all the time, but another part of me is thankful I'm not hahaha.  Wow.  We ordered other things, such as the popcorn shrimp and cheeseburger, but the best thing by far was the pretzel fondu.  YUMMY.    Service was fantastic as well.  If you're staying at Hotel Palomar, there's no excuse to not visit this place because it's in the same plaza.  Tip:  dog friendly on the outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service. I was meeting up with my girlfriends from college. Our server Ian, was thorough, not overbearing, replaced our drinks when they were even only half full, made excellent suggestions. And then after dinner we were hanging out waaaay to long just talking, and instead of bugging us, brought a thoughtful dessert. Can't give enough stars. Thank you Ian."}
{"text":"First time here. Definitely not a waste of a date night  Food was delicious and this place has such a nice vibe. Perfect for a Friday night. Maybe even a Sunday brunch? Yes please."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant!  We were in town for my husband's medical procedure at Banner UMC that did not happen due to an infection.  So we were all kind of bummed out.  Anyway, we luckily found this restaurant and had a fabulous time and an extraordinary meal.  We said we would take a first available seating, was a little apprehensive about sitting outside but it could not have been any better.  We had the perfect table, the weather was perfect, people watching at it's best and we had the best meal ever.  Our server was so attentive and her suggestions perfect.  Thank you Arrogant Butcher!  My husband's open heart surgery was rescheduled for 12/12...so we will be back.  And we are staying even closer...the Residence Inn - Marriott.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and decent happy hour."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch yesterday after being at the convention center for a bit. It was a quick .3 mile walk. The wait was 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting 10.  We ordered the $11 pretzels with \"provolone\" cheese... and while the pretzels were great (and plentiful) and the cheese was good, it was legitimately Velveeta and notsomuch provolone.  I ordered a Mediterranean salad which they accidentally added chicken to and I was required to wait awhile but received no discount. It was good, but only about 40% bigger than my husband's side salad with his turkey sandwich.  They do have a kid's menu, but it's not printed. It's a laundry list of all things kids like. My kids had the mac-n-cheese and it definitely tasted like the same cheese sauce from the pretzels, though good.  All in all, things were fine and good even. The quality of the cheese was something I was hoping would be different and the service was good for the most part. I'm not sure I'd be back. We really like a few other Fox Restaurants but not so much itching to return here."}
{"text":"Our server, the food, and my wonderful companion turned \"going to a restaurant\" into experiencing the restaurant. Celeste is an amazing server and we thoroughly enjoyed her friendliness and professionalism. Our food was superb, we started with the pretzels and provolone per Celeste's suggestion. We then moved towards the wonderfully balanced tabbouleh salad with mixes of tart and savory. Lastly, we split a beef rib stew and they really came through accommodating us. You will receive great service and great food when you come here, I have no doubt."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Arrogant Butcher last night, and it was just amazing! The food alone was worth the trip, but the service was over the top. I'm telling you, I've never had such great service both from our waiter and manager. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and very clean. If I had to say one bad thing about this place, I'd say they will never be able to top last nights dining experience."}
{"text":"Tasty appetizers, dinner and dessert!  Close to the convention center and nearby hotels."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Phoenix on business and picked this place because of the decent ratings on Yelp. It was worth the visit.  Quality service from the time you enter to the time you leave. The oysters from Washington were of decent quality. I had the salmon which was cooked very nicely with a good crispy flakiness. My guest, who was visiting from back east, had the smoked salmon. Although it was completely different than he normally has it, he enjoyed it. Pretty standard fare, but it is well done. Pretty loud ambiance, but you're able to hold a conversation.  I would recommend this as a solid place to have dinner friends for those who are visiting and don't know the area."}
{"text":"Expensive and very tiny portions of steak or fish.  A party of four, we were served no vegetable on any of our dishes  - just some raw leaves sprinkled atop my Mahi-mahi, which was the size of a medium stick of butter. On the upside, the wait staff was very young and attractive. Oh, you have to wait nearly forever for the wine because it has to be apportioned out from the bar into a tiny carafe  - very lame!  You do get an empty stem glass right away. (Probably due to the underage wait staff).  Be sure to say to the waiter while pointing to your glass after 20 minutes of waiting, \"that wine was good, can I have another?''  They will love you for it.  And then when we finished off our food,  this homeless looking older guy in jeans and plaid shirt came to our table to ask how things were going.  I assumed he wanted my leftovers.  We gave him a strange look and asked who he was. Turns out he was the manager.  No he didn't seem arrogant! Unless you count making your staff wear a white shirt, black slacks, apron and tie while you dress  like you just stepped off a big-rig :)."}
{"text":"So glad we went here. Definitely a 5 star restaurant. We did reservations through yelp and open table. We arrived and were seated right away. We ordered the French Onion soup, trout, new York strip and jambalaya. I would highly recommend all of these options we had. The flavors and freshness made the dishes delicious. The atmosphere was really cool. The service was awesome. I would recommend anyone in the area to try this place out. It is a from scratch restaurant. 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was very busy and loud when we went. Our server was patient and explained the menu to us. Food was good and drinks were average."}
{"text":"As much as I love my Mom, I had to seriously fight the urge to steal her food. Was it because I didn't completely love her sweet potato tortelli with mushrooms?  No. The sweet potato filling, the brussels sprouts and mushroom were wonderful compliments to each other. The sauce was savory and butter-y but not over the top, it didn't cover the taste of the veggies.  No what saved my mom's food and kept family peace was the shrimp, sausage and chicken jambalaya. I was skeptical ordering jambalaya outside of NOLA but this was excellent. This seasoning was spot on and the meat wasn't dried and overcooked, which I find frequently in bad jambalaya. Proof the chef knew what he was doing ? The okra maintained their firmness and didn't become soft and slimy like okra frequently does.  Not usually a dessert person I really liked the blueberry cheesecake streusel. The graham crackers did nothing but make a mess but I loved the creaminess of the cheesecake. For another take my brother found the consistency  too soft, he didn't think it would stand up if done as a traditional cheesecake (see pics). My sister-in law seemed fond of the bathroom , venture with confidence.  My mother returned a few days after I left and had the jambalaya, so I guess she's a fan too.  Near the baseball, and basketball arena this should be a definitely spot to check out if you're ever in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was our second time at the butcher  while on a weekend trip to Phoenix to see the symphony. It has become the place we look forward to coming after driving 2.5 hours. We came for lunch on both our visits and am impressed with the menu selection. I have a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounds SO good. The quality of the food we ordered is way above par. I highly recommend the fondue pretzels, salmon chopped kale salad, Cubano sandwich and they also had a fabulous French dip on special. Our server, Patrick was witty and very courteous. I had several questions about some of the items on the menu. He was knowledgeable about all the items and was happy to answer my questions. Refreshing experience when most servers are unknowledgeable on menu items or annoyed when you ask questions. Patrick and the Arrogant Butcher are a class act! Highly recommend and would love to come back for dinner service."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a few a few drinks and a appetizer about 830 on last Saturday night After wanting to stop by for sometime I was disappointed. The guy bartender with the Bow tie who was obviously gay spent the whole time  We were there flirting with the guy next too me and my girlfriend. After 15 minutes we got our first drink never once offered a menu so we finished our drinks wanting a second but after another 15 minutes and waiting never even was offered. I was very  Disappointed and think it was very unprofessionalF"}
{"text":"The staff was inundated with an overflow of customers prior to Sun's game.  My wait for seating was 20 minutes and food took closer to 30 minutes to be delivered. Given the large gathering that was all permissible.    However, my salmon was dry, overdone, lacked flavor and small considering the price tag .   Disappointed in the overall quality.     It'll be many moons should I ever decide to return"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Love the fresh from scratch menu daily. Just be sure to check if there are any concerts or events nearby before u visit as they adjust the menu items and or times on event days."}
{"text":"Went to this gem after seeing a fine musical at the Herberger Theatre and definitely did not disappoint. Like many reviews have said, the pretzel fondue and the short rib stew were in fact all they are cracked up to be. The presentation of it and the meat loaf and definitely nice portions. What I want to met ion is the excellent service. I did not catch the waiters name but he is an ASU college student studying mechanical engineering. Sometimes it is not so good as it's just a job. Well this cat was awesome. Treated my family with respect, very attentive, very informative and really made our dinner special. So happy we spent our Sunday afternoon with this gem in Downtown."}
{"text":"Home run meal!! We were in town for a family event and after walking by decided to try this place out. We walked right in we're greeted and seated In seconds. The menu isn't big but it had good options  and I was so impressed with what I consider the build your own meat and cheese plate. What a great idea. Unfortunately the night before we had a less then satisfying one, so we decided to skip it. We started out with the pretzel rolls and provolone appetizer. AMAZING. We even took the leftover  pretzel balls home on our fight with us. We split the carnitas plate and it was delicious. The savory meat plus tangy veggies and a bit of sweet from the corn cake was awesome. The staff was very friendly and our server was on top of our needs. I was stuffed! I wish I had this restaurant by my home. Should I ever be back in town I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the wedge salad with the braised beef and it was really very tasty.  Didn't look like a wedge salad though.  Colleague wanted the smoked salmon salad but they were out of the smoked salmon.  They were accommodating and used grilled salmon instead.  But I have to ask, how does a restaurant run out of food.  Called ill planning.  They got the four starts because the service was great and our waitress made sure my colleague got the salmon.  When asked for the substitution. She didn't say no, but said let me check."}
{"text":"The waiters were awesome and recommended the best cheese board! The menu was a bit small in variety but we loved our food!"}
{"text":"After our horrible customer service next door at The Strand, I am glad that we brought our business over to you. Thank you for accommodating to us when The Strand wouldn't. We were able to enjoy our New Years Eve, our Birthday Celebration, enjoy our dinner, and get great customer service! The ambiance was a perfect setting for the evening. Happy 2018!"}
{"text":"Good food nasty attitude by hostesses . One person doesn't communicate what the other is doing . Upon arriving on a Saturday pm we were told 15-20 minute Wait. Then someone else told us we are being seated now only to be told by hostess 3 there is a 45  minute wait. These girls are possibly movie stars in dumb and dumber. We ordered a round of drinks only to be told we can't sit On the bench in the bar because that bench is reserved. The people next to us didn't have this issue. I read the hostess the riot act and called over the manager who was apologetic for the rude treatment  although our drinks and appetizer were given to us no charge and the waitress bringing our meal delivered good service . This is not the place to go because of a captive audience and non caring attitude ."}
{"text":"The best waiter is TONY! Amazing service, great customer interaction. We had a party of 16 tonight and Tony handled the party like a true pro!  Friendly, funny and knew exactly how to deal with a big party, the best food and service I've had in a long time! Great job Tony, you are incredible!"}
{"text":"A+!!!! I had the pork carnitas.... So good. Great atmosphere and staff. Delicious food. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with a Fox restaurant!  It is always crowded and full of life, seems like.  The last time I was here I had their Wednesday special of meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Great portion size and enough to bring leftovers for lunch the next day!    I had the pleasure of enjoying this place again!  I didn't know there an additional room towards the back!  So we sat there and began with some chit chat, but unfortunately waited longer than usual for someone to acknowledge our party of 4 to even get us water.  Luckily, that did change and we were compensated with 2 servings of their delicious and popular appetizer:  pretzel (freshly baked) and cheese fondue.  I ordered the pork carnitas nestled on top of a sweet corn cake, drizzled with tomatillo salsa and avocado chunks (also with cabbage and cilantro) ($14).  I loved the combination of sweet and savory!  It really was a lot for me to try to finish after all that pretzel and cheese.  Not complaining!  I also ordered and enjoyed their Moscow Mule.    I also sampled some of the scallops entree, which was enhanced with bacon and bacon flavoring, snap peas, and other bits and pieces of garnish.  This was a nice lighter dish to follow after an appetizer.    Our waiter was very friendly and pleasant to have.  We all enjoyed our dinner!  I would definitely come back here again to try more of their tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Surprise of the decade, Erin likes a Fox restaurant!  We've been here so many times during the past few years. Any time we have something to go to downtown, I first see if there is an available reservation at Arrogant Butcher. I can't ever pass up those damn pretzels and fondue and a glass of bubbly to start a meal.  This past weekend I chose the grilled fish tacos and they were outstanding. The smashed avocado added to each taco was perfect and the little ramekin of white beans and pico on the side was so tasty.  My husband had the beef short rib stew, served with an egg on top and a corn muffin on the side. He wasn't feeling 100% (I very nicely passed him a cold I picked up a while ago) and this was delicious comfort food for him.  Service and ambiance are always top notch. I should really apply to be America's Next Top Fox Fanatic."}
{"text":"FRC restaurants are pretty solid, full of hipsters, and cougars on the prowl. We had a party of 10 and had reservations. We were sat quickly, and the server was fantastic. Here's the disappointment: the gave us the PDR menu instead of letting us order off the regular menu. We were sat in the main dining room, so I don't understand why we got a separate menu. This menu was very limited; no fish and chips, no sandwiches. I ordered the meatloaf: fantastic! It was full of flavor, the mashed potatoes were very creamy. The food did take extraneously long. From the time we sat down to the time we got our check was 3 hours."}
{"text":"Went last night.   Had a great time.  The food was awesome.   Prime rib was way over cooked for Medium.  The potato side dish with it was one of the best I've ever had.  Creamy deliciousness.   Fried Shrimp appetizer was great.   Reminded me of New Orleans.    It's a pricey joint, just me and my wife and $100.   And we split our meal.   Had a few overpriced drinks and it really added up fast.  However, we'll go back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I dropped by here on a Tuesday night after a Suns game.  The place still has a new car scent, seriously, but no worries.  The deconstructed mod decor was slick, the special dining rooms are a nice touch.          The pretzel fondue, apparently a Fox Concepts staple, was fantastically indulgent and delish.  So too were the steamed mussels and chorizo, make sure you get some bread to with it and soak up the broth!  The wine list was simple and straight forward, the selections good.        The staff was a crack squad, perhaps a little over attentive, but that's honestly not a bad thing.  The manager, Ashley, came by and offered suggestions and was wonderfully helpful.        I need to return for an entree, as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a quiet Sunday evening and was not disappointed! Party of 5 with a reservation at 6:45 pm were seated promptly. Appetizers of artichoke hummus and nachos were sooo great. I loved my Beet Salad, son and husband enjoyed fish and chips. Picky daughter happy with hamburger and my sister was happy with fish tacos (but loved the nachos best!)"}
{"text":"hostess was a royal b. went there tonight - she informed us in a rather rude manner it would be a 45 minute wait with at least 10 tables visibly open inside and 30 tables open outside. she seemed overwhelmed and it felt like she wanted us to walk away. ny strip was 36 dollars and a guest leaving said it was not even worth 12. there had to be at least 50 people huddled around bar area and place looked chaotic and poorly  run."}
{"text":"So so so good! Definitely get the butcher's platter if you go. Service was great and our server was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Also, love the cute server outfits. Definitely a spot to hit when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Maybe the full meals are better, but I had a few appetizers which were very forgettable. I sat on the patio, which was actually nice, but pretty annoying that homeless people kept asking for food and money. Oh, and when I put in my reservation I notified them that this was my anniversary. Neither the hostess or the waiter acknowledged it. That would have been nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at this place. As a group of fabulous women, we grubbed at this place. We started with the hummus with veggies, pretzel bread and smoked provolone fondue, crispy bread, and the elephant garlic. Yum, yum, yum on the pretzel bread...we liked it so much we ordered it twice! It was excellent with the roasted elephant garlic...you like garlic you must order to elephant garlic! We decided to do lunch family style, so we also ordered the beet salad, jambalaya, and the short rib stew. Stew all the way...we ordered two it was so good with the fried egg on top. The jambalaya is spicy, so watch out...and the beet salad is refreshing. I truly enjoyed this well cooked meal. And you should too! Go eat here...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was a dry and a little cold service was so slow even when it wasnt that busy . and didnt have anyone check to see if I even liked my food so I couldnt tell them what was wrong."}
{"text":"I first came here on my birthday one year with my girlfriend. I'm pretty sure this place caught her interest because the name is really, really cool.  Arrogant Butcher is a 5 star restaurant because they are so well rounded. The service is impeccable. I've only had the pleasure of having 3 or 4 different entrees here, but they were truly mouth watering. You can tell that the menu was carefully crafted with influence from all around the world, however it is still a very 'Merican experience. The location is great, too. I would say that the crowd here is late 20's to early 50's, but it really depends on time of day. During game days, you'll get all types.  If you're in the Downtown Phoenix area, I strongly recommend coming here. On the nicer days of the year, it's is pretty cool to see both stadiums and several museums when you look out the windows or sit on the patio.  Two things: parking can get difficult, you will mostly likely have to pay for parking (lot or meter). Also, this place is pretty expensive--upwards of $20 a plate--be prepared for this when you're also ordering a bunch of drinks."}
{"text":"neat place, was expecting more unfortunately.  beer list nothing special and if u like good horseradish flavor on ur prime rib sandwich, this ain't it.   my friend's crispy shrimp didn't have a lot of flavor either.  even the peppers were flavorless.  what is arizona's food identity anyway?  was here a week and still didn't get a sense of it. maybe the jokes on me, and all the food is supplied by the same company like an amusement park food court. all the places we went, none were remarkable. sad."}
{"text":"Our menu so far: house made pretzels and provolone fondue, sweet potato tortelli, roasted beet salad, montchevre (goat Brie), chicken stroganoff, smoked pork Cubano, turkey pastrami, French fries, a kids grilled ham and cheese sandwich, a kids chicken tenders, the \"hot chocolate\" cake, and pumpkin cheesecake with pomegranate compote.   Pretzels: yes, just get them. Perfectly cooked and brined, and that provolone has a flavor something of magic. If you can't go for some German bread paired with Swiss/Italian/French melted cheese, well, that's just un-American.   Montchevre: still not a fan of goat cheese. My friend liked it quite well, however.   Roasted beet salad: surprisingly amazing!  I'm not a huge food risk taker, but I do consider myself a foodie, and I'm trying to take more risks with my palette. This was just perfectly combined: roasted beet for a base (first time eating beets, do it here. It was mine, too), Brussel sprouts for depth, pistachios for crunch, prosciutto and accompany sauce for flavor and pomegranates for balance. Seriously, so well dreamed up. I'll definitely be getting it again.   Sweet potato tortelli: not usually a huge sweet potato fan, but I also really loved this. The mushroom and spinach balanced the sweet potato along with the lemon butter type sauce.  The hazelnuts added a touch of flare and texture. So good!  Cubano: such an interesting sandwich with deli thin ham slices alongside smoked pork, topped in a cheddar cheese, (usually Swiss), and had a bit of a kick in flavor. Served in a sturdy folded bread like a panini, I'd say. It was good, but compared to the other items we've had, it's a little forgettable.   Turkey pastrami: that's what good turkey tastes like. First time trying it as a pastrami, but had same flavoring without feeling heavy. The coleslaw was crunchy and had a great sauce inside. The pretzel bun was perfectly portioned not to overwhelm the sandwich. Suggest eating it upside down to allow the ingredients to soak into the top bun as well. Supposedly their best selling sandwich, and I'd have to say, I'm not surprised and would definitely order it again.   Stroganoff: the handmade egg noodles were brilliantly made and perfectly cooked al dente.  The peas tasted fresh and added a little sweetness to a savory dish. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. Never had a chicken stroganoff, but once again the bird made it feel like a lighter meal without sacrificing the savory element you expect from a stroganoff. Just enough sauce, not swimming. Filled with mushrooms - great flavor.   Grilled ham and cheese and chicken tenders - predictable, but well received by the kiddos.   Fries: sandwiches both came with it - wasn't expecting that. Awesome crisp with soft and airy interior. Cooked in truffle oil?  Something, because they had a different, but yummy flavor.   \"Hot chocolate\" cake: made Swiss miss hot cocoa. Pictures something sweet, but it was more of a rich chocolate cake. Almost a brownie flavor with more of a lighter texture (oddly enough, like a soggy cake texture, but in a good way).   Cheesecake: who would have thought pumpkin with pomegranate, but that should just be a permanent thing, since it works so darn well. The cheesecake was lighter and fluffier than a traditional cheesecake, but still good. Topped with a pomegranate seed compote - so good. Finished with some granola style crumble - again, so good. Winter seasonal dessert - switches to blueberry in the summer months.   Desserts are $6 and are on the smaller side, but still enough to share and portioned in a size that even after a meal, you can make room to share one or a couple.   Will be trying the warm peanut butter cup (should have fought harder to try that) and salted caramel pudding in a few weeks (voted best dessert in Phoenix recently).   Definitely a new favorite for when we find ourselves in town."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Fan of the appetizers: the salumi and the grilled asparagus. We had for entree the fish and chips and although the batter was quite good the fish didn't have a lot of flavor, we had to add a bit of lime to improve it. Other people in the group liked their entrees except for one beef entree that was too salty.  The berries for dessert were outstanding. The ice cream was ok, the problem is they serve it in bowls that melt it really quick. The caramel dessert was again too salty."}
{"text":"The waiter was really weird and kept touching thins he shouldn't. He ordered us the wrong bruschetta and instead of offering to bring the correct, laid his finger on the dish until we decided- ew?? He also touched my friends water bottle and the edges of our glasses. Took the bill before we left.. Rude. The breads were not good, but the drinks are great and I've had the ravioli Before that was amazing."}
{"text":"Inconsistent at best. We have had great service, and just so so service here. They do have good ingredients but I feel execution is where the issue is. In our recent visit we had the filet, which must have been near frozen when put on to cook. Was nice in the the very middle but too much of the outer portion was over done. The meat and cheeses are very underwhelming and over priced."}
{"text":"Sam Fox, please add the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh to Zinburger's menu so we can get it in Tucson!"}
{"text":"Upon check in, the hostess was beyond rude.   That all changed when we had a great waiter and even better food!   I had the pastrami sandwich with fries and it was beyond delicious . Very filling !"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. So glad I came here for lunch on a business trip. I had the turkey poblano sloppy joe- it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I wish I could do half stars. Arrogant Butcher is good, but not great. It's consistently good food with good drinks. It also has a good atmosphere. But that's it. Good, good, good. I would never pick Arrogant Butcher as a place I definitely want to go to. It's also a bit overpriced.  I've only ever had salads. The Market Salad is quite tasty. Although, it seems to have spaghetti in it. Not the grain I was expecting. The Chinese Chicken Salad is just ok; it needs more spice. The pretzel balls are legit.  They provide speedy service, and I really appreciate that, especially at lunch time. They're also very accommodating of groups.  I'm curious to try out their happy hour."}
{"text":"My hotel downtown Phoenix  highly suggested I eat at the arrogant butcher. I looked at the menu and was about to order the filet. My server suggested I try the ruben sandwich on a pretzel bun.  I was skeptical, but decided why not. Hands down it was the best combinations of flavors. The Ruben had great carved texture with pepper edges. I too must jump on the bandwagon. I loved that the pretzel bun was cooked perfectly it was warm, brown and soft. Normally pretzel buns get hard as they cool in temperature. But not in this case. I did get my cole slaw on the side. Amazing sandwich that kicked my filet taste buds out my mouth. I could eat this Ruben multiple times a week. I also suggest during happy hour to try the mule cocktail  or carne asada nachos."}
{"text":"Not the worst, but not the best given the prices. Stopped for lunch. The fish and chips were ok, the cod was a little too greasy and the breading would slide right off. Fries were also over cooked. I must say the atmosphere is great, however. And the entire staff is super super friendly (that bumps them up 1 star) I will definitely come back because of the service alone. Just going to have to try something different."}
{"text":"Super awesome restaurant. Went here on a date. We started with the pretzels and cheese which is some of the best we have tasted (we get pretzels and cheese anywhere that has them). For the entree we had the crab stuffed chicken which they brought to us already split in half. It had a gravy on top that was amazing. This place also has a really cool atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited here about a month ago for our anniversary dinner, I was really excited based on the reviews I've read, specifically for the turkey sloppy Joe because my husband and I do not eat beef or pork. Appetizer, the pretzel bites and cheese fondue was not good, pretzels were too salty and taste stale. Main course, had to send my dish back, my bun seemed to had been wet and then sat out to dry and my sloppy Joe was literally cold. At this point, I'm irritated after a long Diamondbacks game I was starving and I was just not satisfied. It took about 15 minutes to get my new plate of food by which time my husband was finishing up his seafood soup which he described as \"ok\" . I took a few bites of my sloppy Joe and wasn't impressed. Maybe we came on a bad day or perhaps too late but we were definitely not satisfied with the food. The customer service was excellent, just wish the food matched the service."}
{"text":"Love this place! They make a really good Prime Rib as their Saturday special. Also tried their oysters which were really good, briny in taste.   Service here is always good (as are most Fox Concept Restaurants). Also, I would recommend making a reservation, especially on Saturdays, super busy."}
{"text":"Best beet salad I have ever had.  Great ambience too with the proximity to the Suns arena."}
{"text":"Just to give a little background before I talk about my food, I find most restaurants outside of NYC to be disappointing usually, and I am rarely impressed by food in general. That said, the Crab Stuffed Chicken they have for dinner here was one of the most divine dishes I have ever had. The night I came here for dinner (it was a work thing), I was under a great deal of stress, and I normally get appetite loss when I'm anxious, however I could not stop taking more bites of that incredible meal. Before I knew it, my plate was empty and I regretted not having slowed down to savor it. But whatever, c'est la vie! Anyway I look forward to enjoying more of the butcher's (who has every right to be arrogant) gustatory delights. P.S. this is my first yelp review, that's how much I loved it"}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. I always enjoy the ambiance at this restaurant and I have always had friendly service. My favorite thing to get here is the jambalaya but you cant go wrong everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Came to The Arrogant Butcher for Arizona Restaurant Week 2011.  Had a very difficult time finding the place.  So much construction and traffic in downtown Phoenix.    Very cute ambiance.  Friendly server and manager who kept checking up on us.    Food was divine!  Ordered the tabbouleh salad, smoked salmon rillette, jambalaya, grilled swordfish, sweet potato tortelli, salted caramel sundae and blueberry cheesecake.  Everything was delicious.  Our whole table couldn't stop raving about each dish.  I don't know where all these 1 and 2 star ratings are coming from?  I had an amazing time and enjoyed every minute."}
{"text":"I had dinner there with a group of eight. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time, but then had to wait another 10 minutes before our waiter showed up. I hadn't gotten a drink yet, and had to wait another 10 minutes before I got one.  The meatloaf I ordered was pretty basic. It was supposed to come with some mashed potatoes and beans, and there were tiny bit of those, but more like a garnish than actual side. The meatloaf was also covered in about a quarter inch of ketchup, so there's really no way to describe how it tastes and accept like ketchup. Pretty lame considering the place is supposed to be known for its Meats.  If you're in the center of Phoenix and looking for a place that doesn't suck, you might want to keep looking. Fortunately, you have a lot of alternatives."}
{"text":"Hmm-Didn't love it, didn't hate it. I was indifferent. I like the decor and if I could give it a half a star just for having an outdoor dining area, I would. The menu left a lot to be desired for me. We went at lunch time so I don't know what the dinner menu looks like. It was just ok. Nothing blew me away. It's nice for people watching and has a really nice location."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher treated me right. I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when my girlfriend took me here to surprise me for my 31st Birthday and that she did.   We had a table of 10 good friends enjoying different brews before deciding on our meal strategy. Before we could dabble into the Raw Bar we were greeted with two pretzel and cheese dishes. Apparently the secret was out that this was a birthday. So we carried on enjoying the pretzel and cheese and ordering oysters, shrimp and mussels. All which were tasty. The shrimp are enormous, the oysters about average and their Jalapeño Mignonette sauce was something that stood out for me. I could almost drink it, but I've got a thing for spice.   I decided to stick with the seafood theme and I ordered the New Zealand Sea Bass for dinner and it was tasty. Living in Florida the past 3 years has spoiled me with seafood compared to Arizona. With that said the price of the seafood was a little steep but the quality was there.  Everyone ordered something different and I tried a bite of each one... All were good. We also tried one of every dessert.... All were good!  I believe this is one of those places that you can't go wrong with. I will come back and thanks Arrogant Butcher for showing my group a good time."}
{"text":"Came with a big group. Accommodated all of us excellently. The menu for the group was great and the service fantastic. I'd bring a group here again, and I look forward to visiting just with friends or family."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced and the food is subpar at best. I tried liking it but I just can't. The service was terrible as well. So disappointed in this place. We waited so long just to get a table, only to be very disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, fun, loved it!!!! The pretzel rolls and sauce were amazing. I ate too many and was already full by the time my salad came. My husband had a French dip and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. The service was excellent. We sat at a seat facing the kitchen and it was very exciting to watch all the happenings in the kitchen. If I lived here, I would be in trouble because I would frequent this place all too often. Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good but also really busy all the time.  Pros: Convenient location if downtown. All the food we had on 3 separate visits was very good. Salads, apps, snacks, mixed drinks, all very good. Service was okay, certainly not blown away with personality or speed, but not bad. Great alcohol selection. TV's everywhere but no sound.  Cons: Extremely busy at all times, especially lunch. Prices were fair, maybe a touch overpriced but considering all the food was great I'd say prices were fair. No happy hour or specials to speak of.  Have been 3 times and next time I'm in PHX, I'm sure we'll go again."}
{"text":"Great dinner, great happy hour, great restaurant. I love the Fox Restaurants and this is my second favorite. Favorite dish is the green chili and carnitas. The atmosphere is amazing. The service is always among the best. They clearly take pride in their restaurant and it shows. Food was luke warm is the only reason for 4 and not 5 stars. It was still all very very good. We got in quickly despite no reservation and deciding last minute to go, they quoted an accurate wait time and we were in and out before the game we went to across the street."}
{"text":"Number 1 on yelp is no lie ! Great food, novel cocktails & fantastic service ! Elecka was well versed in the menu & gave great advise on our meal. A patio view of the Talking Stick arena & the Metro make for a lively city atmosphere. We will be back !"}
{"text":"I recently dined with a large party.  They had a great room to accommodate our group!  It is nice to dine with so many people and TALK with each of the dinner guests.   The staff was eager to please (took photos, made menu suggestions, recommended beers / wines...even swapped out the drinks if you didn't enjoy).    As I dined with a large group, we ate from a set menu...appetizers of bread, spreads and Italian meats were delicious.  The salads were good.  I was pleased with my choice of the crab stuffed chicken and even happier with the cheesecake for desert!"}
{"text":"The salted caramel pudding, the pretzel with fondue, the deviled eggs...amazing.  Service is always spectacular and it's nice how they work as a team to ensure everyone is satisfied."}
{"text":"Fabulous service every time, love their menu and drinks...oh my god their drinks are fabulous! Super cute restaurant and bar!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I've never been disappointed! After last night - I knew I needed to write a review...This is a made by scratch kitchen so everything is very fresh and presented well. I asked our waiter if I could just have grilled chicken and steamed vegetables and he immediately said it was no problem. I wasn't expecting much and when everyone else at my table had been served before me, I was jealous of what I saw and was thinking mine will be so plain- After laughing with my table, my food arrived- and what I was presented with was amazing!! Not only did it look beautiful but it tasted fabulous! I told our waiter how good it was and how surprised I was that I got such an amazing dish- he told me he left it up to the chef to create something for me...I was so impressed! It wasn't your usual carrots, cauliflower and broccoli-The vegetables he chose were fresh- beets, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, onions, broccolini, brussel sprout leaves, and I think sliced beans- it was perfect!! Kudos to an amazing staff for providing top notch food!! I will definitely return"}
{"text":"I ordered the prime rib and deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were bland. The prime rib was so salty!! I couldn't even eat it all, which is so unlike me. Ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Yes this place is BA. Try some charcuterie - especially the pate. The turkey pastrami sandwich is amazing. The bloodies could be better tho."}
{"text":"This place is eh.  Not sure what all the hype is about. Nachos barely had avocado and the pork was definitely poor quality.  Friends had the prime rib and although it looked good, they felt it was nothing special.  I had the bbq chicken.  The chicken was fair but I must say that the corn muffin was great!"}
{"text":"We (My husband and I) are huge foodies and chose this place for our anniversary dinner after reading  the reviews. The place is chic and upscale for Phx. It is in the heart of the (so-called ) downtown area. The place looked crowded and ALIVE at 9 pm on a Saturday night and this is a plus (as it is not typical of restaurants in Phx).  The food was good and the service was OK but  our server was not the best in taking care of the changes I requested on the standard entree on the menu. She was too excited and loud (as she was training someone who was shadowing her). I liked the food but the server was too nosy as she would ask like every 10 minutes  if we liked what we were eating (Ahem... a little privacy please!, we are trying to have a  conversation here). I got tired of smiling at her whenever she asked IF I WAS DOING OK (OF COURSE, MY MOUTH WAS FULL AND i DID  NOT WANNA BE RUDE).  That said, it is  FUN PLACE with good but small portion food, might  be better with more people."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had dinner last night and the food was amazing. I took a star away because the service was just okay. The people who brought our food out were super nice. However, our waitress brought us our drinks and disappeared. I had to ask another server to bring us our check. We had planned to have to desert as well but it took so long to get our check we skipped it."}
{"text":"Service, meh. Pretzel and cheese fondue, best I have ever had. I live downtown and go here just for these."}
{"text":"I had the hummus appetizer and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  I asked the waiter to verify the ingredients and quality which he said dry chickpeas, lemon, garlic and tahini were used. The could have been more vegetables but that's just my preference.  There service was prompt, professional, and pleasant.  I liked the vibe of the place and it was clean.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again but if I'm in the area I might swing by.  I would say if you're into basic American food, then this would be up your alley."}
{"text":"We got the chicken club and the prime rib dip!!! French fries and side salad!! It was yummy!!!!!!:) Only problem was not a kids menu. They will make a few items for the kids!!! The chicken tenders... The kids did not like them... Not your normal kid friendly kid coating!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience at a The Arrogant Butcher! I came with friends on Friday night and ate out on the patio. I had the short rib stew, it was so good! Tony was our server and he is the BEST! He was so knowledgable and made our experience perfect. We will definitely be back to see Tony at the Arrogant Butcher"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Interesting menu. Near to performance and sports venues. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Arrogant Butcher is awesome! My hubby and I stopped in for a bite on date night. We had some great drinks, food and service!  I had the Waldorf salad and a couple oysters, and we shared a pretzel fondue. If you are in any Fox Restaurant, you MUST get the pretzel fondue if it is offered! The best! my salad was perfect! The menu looked great and I can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"We came here during Comicon to grab some drinks and food. The service was amazing. Our waiter was incredibly helpful and sweet. I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun. My husband ordered the fish tacos and said they were great. Everyone else in our group really enjoyed their food as well.  I can't wait to come back the next time we're downtown."}
{"text":"I love fox restaurants. Knowing arrogant butcher is a fox, I jumped on the opportunity to give it a shot. My first experience was great but after the fact, I ended up getting my first ever case of food poisoning. I ordered a salad with chicken. I gave this restaurant a second chance when I had to go there for a work meeting. This time I didn't get sick but the two other coworkers I was with ended up BOTH getting food poisoning!  They ordered salads, one had chicken and one has salmon. That was the last straw for me. I love the atmosphere and the overall restaurant but I can strongly say I will not be back."}
{"text":"I did three stars because it really was just a-ok but clearly has the ability to be amazing. I think we probably just went on an off day and we may give it another shot if we make it back down town sometime. We had high hopes, AB has been on our radar for a bit now and it was really decent except that each dish really had one minor problem or another. Food network has turned America into a bunch of wanna be food critics who imagine themselves on the set of Chopped when ordering lunch/dinner.  Look at me and \"call my guilty\" but hey, I am the one paying to go out so I can say what I want right?. Hmmm.... Location is good and the place is definitely beautiful, clean, modern, awesome. We were seated right away and had great service throughout the meal. The antipasto meat and cheese was the best thing we ate...We got the ham, blue cheese, olives and garlic...you can go through and make your plate however you want (like ordering sushi) -very clever. The bread was fantastic, grilled, warm, soft...our only complaint was the garlic had gone a little long and got that bitter taste but overall this was good (could be Great!). I ordered a strawberry lemonade...granted the server did advise after the fact that they are working to perfect the recipe, but this was nothing short of horrible.  Watered down, lack of strawberry and just overall lack of flavor. $4 for this, I think not. You would be better off with pink lemonade from the coke machine...Come on Fox, I know you have a good recipe floating around somewhere, this needs help! Our server was great and took it off our bill. Okay so main dish...My wife got the famous Chinese chicken salad. It was everything it should be, fresh greens, good dressing, nice crisp won-tons except the chicken was very dry and tasted like it was prepared much earlier. I had the jambalaya which had amazing flavor but was way way way too spicy. I like heat, I'm not a spice baby either...you will find some crazy spice guy who would love you for this dish but overall you have to remember your target audience here....It was so hot I could not eat it. The sausage is amazing, the shrimp were nice and cooked perfectly, the rice was excellent...it was just lost to the spice. Burn me now, burn me later kinda dealeo. - Don't take my ramblings to suggest it was bad, it was not by any stretch....I just know how much better this team of fine individuals could, and most likely will, make it be."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went in on a Friday night. I have to agree with Thomas about this whole cityscape fiasco, it was a little hard to find, but we got there all the same and were happy when we did. They really did a nice job with the place. I love the set up, the open bar and kitchen, and all the decor was nice.  We sat up at the Chefs table, and all the guys behind the counter were super friendly, which is above and beyond if you ask me, just getting orders out and executing them well is enough, so it was nice that they were interacting with guests on top of it. Our server was friendly as well, very helpful. The bar did start to run a little slow, our second round of drinks took awhile, but no biggie. I did, however, find the food just a little underwhelming. One of the cooks gave us a sample of the pretzel fondue, and to be honest it is what sticks out to me the most, they were delicious. We also had the black mussels with spicy pork shoulder and pommes fites, the broth was a little bland, which was shocking because they had a really intense aroma. The sea salt chips were alright and the potato fitters were forgettable. For an entree we split the grilled sword fish, which was good. My Husband was a little disappointed that with a name like The Arrogant Butcher they didn't have more cuts of meat on the menu. I think our favorite part of the meal was the after school specials we ordered, they were a great summer drink, very refreshing, otherwise we may go back, but its not on the top of our list."}
{"text":"A fried egg?  With Green Chile?  Okay, well, I'm feeling open-minded, which does not often happen with Green Chile, so I go for it.  To be fair, it seems like every time a Chef wants to differentiate, he tosses a fried egg on it, \"There!  Magnifique!\"  Well, okay, this time it works.  I am a green-chile snob and I fall in the camp of \"it's not chile if it has beans in it\", so again, dubious about this concoction of Short-Rib Green Chile stew, I tried it anyway.    The yolk from the perfectly cooked sunny-side up egg blended into the chile, quickly disappearing while adding a rich texture to the savory sauce.  For me, the chile spice was a bit mild, although it did have a pleasant afterburn that let you know this was a southwestern dish.  This was a thick stew of tender beef, beans and chiles served with a moist, buttery cornbread muffin on the side.  While I could dicker about the ingredients, I cannot argue that it was not tasty, albeit a bit on the salty side.  Washed down with a smooth Kiltlifter Scottish Ale from Four Peaks was a perfect choice.  My wife had the Chicken Stroganoff, a pappardelle noodle dish with a sauce that reminded her of Coq au Vin.  Peas and mushrooms complimented the sliced chicken, making this dish a winner.  Youngest daughter had grilled Salmon with fried potatoes and had no complaints.  It's difficult to get any sort of description from the young ones, so as long as she liked it, which she did, I consider it a winner.  Kids had the salted caramel pudding dessert and raved about it.  The one thing that was a big negative for me was the service.  Impersonal is the word that comes to mind.  \"Hands-off\" is a phrase that comes to mind.  While the server did his job adequately, he was slow at everything, and did not check back until we were practically done with our meal.  I wish he could have been more present."}
{"text":"My server changed my total bill amount after I left. She increased her tip amount. Beware! Pay only in cash and don't bother tipping more than 10%. Update: The restaurant has apologized to me and corrected the error."}
{"text":"Quality: 5 Ambiance: 5  Price (Relative): 5  So the three things I base my rating off (scale of 1-5) and they are the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the price relative to both of the first two. We went to dinner at the Arrogant Butcher and at first walking in the place seemed like a cool trendy retro diner.   We started off our meal with the Butcher's Platter - which is the Chef's daily favorite charcuterie board. It included (1) the Prairie Breeze & (2) Bellwether Farms cheeses; the (3) Fra'mani Salumi & (4) La Quercia Proscuitto Americano, as well as (5) Tosted Cibatta, garlic oil & balsamic, (6) jalapeno corn bread (7) Crispy Prosciutto Deviled Eggs, and (8) Marcona almonds. For $23 this was definitely a great way to try multiple items and from what our waiter said, they are known for their \"Charcuterie boards.\"   For my main dish I got the Crab Stuffed Chicken - I was a little surprised when the plate arrived and it was literally to pieces of chicken with crab in the middle. I will be honest, I expected it to literally be stuffed chicken, but I promise once I got past the second bite I didn't care if it was inside, on top of, underneath, or in between two pieces of chicken. It sat on a bead of spinach and the flavors were amazing. I definitely loved all of the flavors and would definitely order the same plate again.   Last I think the most important question I always ask myself and my company, is if I/they would ever go back. To warrant a yes to me it has to be all encompassing as well as have other items on the menu I can't wait to try. I don't often say yes, especially when I am traveling, but I will definitely go back to the Arrogant Butcher and would love to try man of their other entrees!"}
{"text":"After a bad seating assignment by the Hostess (1 of 6 standing around more focused on their issues then the customers') in the outside area, which was in a far corner. We encountered a subsequent major delay in service, so we force a relocation to a much better table where Rylie took care of us as it should be done. She has the establishment's best interest in heart!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times since it opened. Unfortunately, this last experience was not the best. After being seated about 8:30 pm on a Friday night, our server came and took our drink order. Then, another one came and took our food order. The original server was nowhere to be seen; we figured it was because the restaurant was getting quieter, and so they sent some of the staff home. No problem. But, after that, after delivering our food, the second waiter never came back. Several people had ordered iced tea of which none were ever refilled. Only waters were refilled. After our plates were cleared, we sat for a good 10 minutes looking for server to bring us the check. Eventually we had to snag a third server to bring us the check. Disappointing. I remember when the restaurant first opened. There was a large size crowd and sometimes a long wait. Now, you can walk right in and be seated (there were 5 of us). Hopefully the service will improve, because restaurants in this area compete fiercely for patrons. I hope the smaller crowd was not an indication that this restaurant is beginning to suffer."}
{"text":"I totally agree with the other yelpers about how Phoenix really needs more places like this.  I love the sidewalk patio dining and cool downtown location.  There was a large selection of food from oysters on the half shell to artisan cheeses to fish and chips to steak to popcorn shrimp.  With such lack of culinary focus one might think mediocrity would come with every dish, but I happily report not.  We had oysters, skirt steak, bread and roasted vegetables, and some small assorted plates.  Everything was fantastic.  The combination of urban patio, eclectic menu, and great service make for a fun meal.  The one complaint I have is the price.  It's quality food but I did feel a little taken.  For instance, a draft beer was nearly $6 (I see it as an index since beer, even when hand crafted, is like the cheapest stuff on earth).  Anyway, it loses one star for the gouge but people with deeper pockets and looser fingers may add the star back."}
{"text":"I took my family to The Arrogant Butcher last night and, as I have experienced previously, the food was excellent! I've eaten here several times and everything I've tried has been amazing. Additionally, Ian, our server last night, was on point. He joined in having fun with my 3 year-old grandson and was not phased by me having a suitcase in tow as I had come straight from the airport. Ian was so 'on' he even anticipated when we needed drinks refreshed. Great service! I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and both times were very pleasant. You have to get the pretzel fondue - its amazing. It is basically what you always dreamed of when ordering a pretzel and cheese sauce at the ball park - only this time the cheese dip is amazing and flavorful and the pretzel is moist and perfectly warm. For dinner we had the crab stuffed chicken which was very good and the Bolognese with Ricotta Dumplings. This dish was amazingly good - unfortunately it had been removed from the menu for some reason by the time we got back for our second visit.   The second visit was to kill an hour before taking friends to the airport. We got an assortment of beers and appetizers - all were good especially the rock shrimp, the bacon and cheese stuffed potato bites (not the real name) and of course the pretzel fondue again. We sat on the patio and the open atmosphere was great. Highly recommend as a change from the usual fare."}
{"text":"All I had was the salted caramel pudding....Dddddaaaammmmmmmmnnnn! It was gooood. Tastes just like those little caramel blocks I used to eat as a kid (and admitting with guilt, even now too). Def try this dessert! Staff was friendly and nice too. Very quick service!"}
{"text":"We love the place but their food is too pricey and overrated.  Especially the ones the are off the menu. We wanted to drink wine that night and the server offered us ANGELA Pinot Noir, and we were shocked when our bill arrived. The wine cost 80 bucks!!! We complained with the wine manager but unfortunately he can't do something about it anymore. Too bad for us. definetly wont coming back for more.:((("}
{"text":"Stopped here for a later lunch after a morning/afternoon of the current Festival VB tourney. Group of 6, mostly hungry teens! We walked in and Hannah the hostess with the fing mostest greeted us. Hey girl...heyyy. She gets my vote for best hostess EVA! She was so welcoming, has a great attitude and she was joyful. Yes joyful! I even got up from my table to go back and chat with her for a few mins. Keep sparkling and doing the damn thang girl! Yasssss.  We also had an amazing waitress but I don't know how to spell her name tho(sad face). She checked on us just enough and made sure we actually were enjoying our food.   Ok on to the food. My kiddo and I split the shrimp appetizer which was delicious, chopped salad(champagne dressing) was so good along with the fish and fries. The fish was light and not heavy but needed the vinegar or whatever you fancy and the fries were delicious... lol. We really enjoyed our food. Rest of the group had burger, grilled cheese, prime rib sandwich and the mac n cheese. They all raved how good the food was. When you are out numbered by hungry teens taller then you make sure you feed them good food folks!  Alec one of the mgrs stopped by also, he to was warm and genuinely welcoming.  Great customer service. I was feeling the A to the B y'all vibe was on point, decor modern and a lil boujee boo boo just like I like it..heyyyy now. I will definitely be making a return visit to hit them up for dinner to see how they vibe.  Thanks Yelp Fam!"}
{"text":"I ate here once and although it was a long wait to be seated due to the demand, the food and service was well worth it. Thanks for the enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"too similar to culinary dropout for me but i did only sit at the bar for happy hour. The happy hour menu wasn't out of the ordinary but the drink I had was tasty! I did notice the dining area had a different feel and would like to go back to check it out...but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff...professional and friendly. Also very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.Great downtown location for a pre or post theater dinner."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is pretty amazing  The Fix - $4 of berry rum goodness that goes down smooth Roasted Peppers Toast - Great simple starter executed well BLT - The tomato jam was interesting and I would've liked the toast bread for the BLT instead of their (pretzel?) buns"}
{"text":"- Very entertaining space.  We sat in the seats that overlooked the kitchen right in front of the charcuterie/salad station.   It's always interesting to see the kitchen at work.  One guy was the mushroom guy for the night.  Giant delicious looking mushrooms.  His attention to detail as he was cleaning and inspecting them was admirable  - The charcuterie board was ok.  We had the chef's board and it had two meats (a prosciutto and a dried sausage), bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, and a bunch of pickled vegetables and one cheese.  Nothing spectacular, but it was a decent start.  - The scallops were delicious.  Perfectly tender and a nice savory preparation  - Service was solid"}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out and eat! Loved being in this restaurant. The store was very modern and looked kind of like a man cave. So if you're looking for a spot that a great hang for dudes I would recommend this spot.  My initial encounter with staff was great although there seemed to be some major confusion on happy hour menus. I guess they couldn't find them or something? Heard something about a menu switch happening. The waitress just ended up telling us what was on it.  The appetizers were great and the drinks were over the top.   I highly would recommend this place especially if you are trying to kill time before catching a flight. I feel the airport was only 4 miles away.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! Flew in early for a conference and this was close to my hotel. It opens at 12pm and there were already 50 people outside in line. I really, really wanted to order the crab stuffed chicken but I had to go with the meatloaf as I always order this whenever I see it on a restaurant menu because chances are that it will taste incredible and it was! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got the NY Strip with roasted vegetables and creamed horseradish. Not bad, little too much gristle for me. My wife got the Filet with creamed spinach and crispy potato (which I believe means is a whole deep fried potato). Again, not bad. Also got the hummus, which we get every time we go here. The crusty bread with oil, has a delicious syrupy aged basalmic hidden under the oil so you have to dig to the bottom"}
{"text":"With all the hype, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant. I was pretty disappointed. Food was good, but Just good. We had a reservation, and still had to wait for a table for over 15 minutes. The wait for our food was also very lengthy. Service was ehh. Overall, I am not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The ambiance is spot on! Loved the motif and the chicks in suspenders and guys in vests was very in sync with the title! Meat was delicious, pairings on par and service direct and in line with theme. A bit slow, but good meat prepared right often is! The name caught my attention and the experience held it! Check them out."}
{"text":"The food here was decent and they allow you to have your dog on the patio. Gave 3 stars because of the service. Our waiter was very slow and didn't seem to know the menu very well. I got up to use the restroom, came back out and he had taken my food away and I wasn't even finished. I have never had that happen before. Was very slow getting our checks to us. Overall, I would come back here and give it a second chance because the food was good."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends the night before the cardinals Game.  Food was ok.  The service was a little slow."}
{"text":"I'm excited to say I've tried another Fox Concept restaurant.  Although this one did not have my palette preferences, what I ordered was good and the ambience was great! Really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"We had a great evening out on the patio. We started with the pretzel and cheese fondue. Very good, I wish I could bake such a fine bread, it was really light and tasty. I had the scallops, a bit sandy but that's par for the course, only 4 of them. Pricey, $23, I would of thought 6 for that price. Hubby had the beef short rib stew, he liked it. Guest had fish and chips and she cleaned her plate. Other guest had the chicken stroganoff which looked great. Homemade noodles, he said it needed a bit more sauce. We all split the salted caramel pudding, super sweet but really good. A table over had 3 orders of the ribs and they smelled terrific, I'll order them next time. We were there at 745, we didn't order our entrees until about 845 and by then the prime rib was sold out. That was my first choice, also saw that at other tables and it looked great. Too much time chit chatting! Our waiter was great, he knew we were going to be there for a long time and never rushed us. We hadn't seen these friends in years so it was a great time. 6 beers and 2 ice teas plus entrees and appetizer was $145 plus tip so $175. Not what I want to pay for everyday meals but I'm ok with it. The patio is very comfortable, not too crowded, service was what I wanted, food was good, people watching was fun, I felt very comfortable. Next time we will try indoors and I'll order meat, earlier!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. It's a good date night spot, but not great to meet up with friends.   The Mac and cheese was pretty solid. The food was just ok.   Hard to identify the food style because it's a wide array of types of food"}
{"text":"Went to the arrogant butcher last night as a belated birthday dinner with my love. Had a somewhat difficult time getting there, its on a one way street, we parked at the garage underneath the location. Thankfully they validated parking. Inside is decorated like TGI Fridays, looks very casual dining to me, but the prices don't reflect the casual atmosphere.   He ordered the Thursday special which was fried chicken and biscuit. He seemed to like it although he didn't eat it all, he ate all the coleslaw but there was half a chicken breast and a chicken leg leftover as well as half the biscuit. I personally didn't love the honey drizzled over the lightly battered chicken skin. I guess that's an acquired taste.  I had the filet mignon which for $36 should not have been dry like it was . I did order it medium well, but that usually leaves me with a little moistness. Despite being dry it was very tasty. I liked the potatoes and creamed spinach that came with it. I absolutely loved the cocktail that I ordered called Butchers Blood and Sand. The waitress asked me what kind of drinks I usually like and I told her that lately I've been drinking Manhattans. She said I would probably like this drink and she was correct. It came like a martini and it had a wonderful unique creamy and sweet flavor, not as strong as a Manhattan but delicious none the less. It includes pigs nosed scotch, cherry heering, Carpano Antica, orange juice, clove and orange bitters.   We had no room in our belly for dessert.   My server was very good about checking up on us and making sure we enjoyed our dinner. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 maybe cause I was looking for something a little more formal and partly because my meat was dry. This was not a cheap meal it came to $96 including tip for 2 people."}
{"text":"I love this place! If I could afford to eat here all the time, I would. We had an amazing meal and the service is great too. It's super fun to watch the kitchen work their magic while you watch too."}
{"text":"(Review is based on my experience as a diner at large private dinner here in early January 2015.)  Regardless of my party size, I think the most important take away from my review that follows is that my taste buds are actually still reminiscing about the meal a week & a half later.  We were sat in the cozy private room to the right corner of the restaurant for our company dinner. Upon finding our seats, we were immediately greeted by our friendly server who brought an unexpected starter basket of warm hot pretzels with cheese and a basket of fried shrimp w/fried peppers and a zesty dipping sauce.   We had a preset menu choice of salmon w/veggies (Brussel sprouts); beef; or chicken stuffed with crab & a veggie side. For dessert, we had the choice of salted caramel pudding or pumpkin cheesecake w/compote.  I went with the salmon and pumpkin cheesecake and SO glad I did. I really hope this is available to any of you on the main menu because it's something worth coming here for. Also, don't expect to overeat as the portions were typical of a high end dining experience.   I didn't think seafood in the desert could ever be so good. The glaze and char marks were perfect to my pallette. I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts, especially ones with a little char and was happy to see halves in the vegetable mix under the salmon (I only wish there was a little more).   The pumpkin cheesecake was served in a mini jam-like jar with the cheesecake part on the bottom, fruit on top and crumbled crust on top. Needless to say, it was love at first bite. I kindly shared in exchange for a bite of the salted caramel pudding which was also good but nothing in comparison from my point of view.  The restaurant was packed of what seemed like diners happy to be enjoying the experience there. I only wish I lived closer so that I could return sooner!"}
{"text":"Came here before Pink and I was not disappointed. The salmon was cooked perfectly and you have to try the salted caramel pudding!"}
{"text":"The name is appropriate for the service. Arrogant. Overpriced food that was mediocre, at best. And a waiter who spent his time visiting with one table while the remainder of his tables sat with empty glasses.  And the unsweet tea had a sweet taste that the waiter couldn't identify-turned out to be pineapple I'm allergic so I needed to know). Again, arrogant.  I asked for no cheese on my burger. One bite, covered in cheese.  Truly a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Food, service, ambiance and location is great . I got kale salad with chicken n my hubby got NY steak. I was so happy with my food. Our waiter, micheal helped us with wine list n he recommended a new cab,Zin,Syrah which was a great pick! I highly recommend this place. They have a private room with tv for groups"}
{"text":"I ate here everyday and my health improved... I need to start cooking myself in Davis now that Inrealize how bad the food is in Davis, Ca.  Carmel Salted Pudding and Warm Peanut Butter Cup were amazing desserts.  I only ate the AB Burger with a side salad.  Feel great, want to visit downtown Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Good things come to those whose who eat here.  Beef short rib stew green chiles, fried egg, cornbread 14. It was a lengthy decision but I had to hurry up because the lunch rush was starting up and the house soon was going to be hopping.  If you read Phoenix Magazine, my lunch was featured on the cover.  I started with the corn bread. This bread was the bomb. Moist, golden brown and would spring back just a bit upon the touch. I could taste a little jalapeño heat. It was wonderful. I easily could have had another piece of bread.  Now the hearty beef bowl. Even tho I would have preferred to have this dish on a cool crisp day, that just ain't happening for a while longer. The gravy was just right. The brown meat was perfect. There was other stuff in there but I didn't pick at it to study, I just ate. There was a little time for the different flavors to mingle & marry as they rocked the palate. Loved the egg over easy.  Thank you Jason for taking care of me."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Generally, I'm a fan of Fox restaurants.  I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but based upon our last couple visits in the last couple weeks, I'm sorry to give it a very average 3-star review.  What does this place do right?  Like all Fox restaurants, the atmosphere is great.  Nice patio, nice interior, cool vibe.  Also, the price point is quintessential Fox.  Above average prices, but not too high, especially considering this is his chophouse concept.    It's the service and the food that got to me these past couple times.  Service has been . . . uneven.  Both dinners were pre-concert, so we let our server know.  Ordered only entrees and it took an extraordinary amount of time to get the food before we scarfed it down and rushed out the the door.  Second time, server was more efficient but pretty inattentive.  On visits previous to these, I've sat at the bar and gone for lunch, and service then has been great.  As for food, last two visits I ordered the chicken stroganoff and the fish & chips.  The stroganoff was bad.  I appreciate the house-made noodles, but they were overcooked in a thin, watery, very bland sauce.  Two smallish pieces of chicken.  This, after the long wait, was disappointing.  Second visit, the fish & chips.  Came out piping hot and the flavor was fine, but, they over-fried them and let them sit in the deep fryer.  They were extremely greasy.  Crispy, but greasy.  Not that I'm expecting health food from fish & chips, but this was a bit too much.  In the past, I've ordered the brussel sprout salad and kale salad, both were excellent.  The nachos were huge and pretty tasty, and they have the old Culinary Dropout standby of the pretzel bites with cheese fondue, which are also tasty.    I wouldn't dissuade anyone from going.  It's location is pretty perfect for music and sporting events and the food is generally fine.  Though it doesn't stand out from the the rest of the Fox crowd, and there are some kinks to work out, thus the 3-star review."}
{"text":"Love the pretzels!!!!! Every time I come to Arizona definitely this is the choice of place that I just dine.  Great pretzel and great environment."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday evening at around 6:30pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of two.  This place is really interesting because it seems like there are different portions of the restaurant that try to give off different atmospheres. There's a bar in the front that has modern decor. We ate in an area that seemed to represent a diner from the 1950s and had an open kitchen. There's an area in the bad that seemed to have a lot of bigger tables for larger parties and had a lot of portraits of baseball players. It seems like you can have a different experience depending on what you go there for.  CHEESE RAVIOLI ($15) - This dish just didn't have the cheese flavors I was expecting in a cheese ravioli dish. There wasn't much of it and the ravioli itself didn't have much flavor. My girlfriend ordered the rainbow trout and she mentioned the same thing about the fish not having much flavor. The pine nuts gave it the crunchiness and the spinach gave the dish much needed saltiness. I was just not the biggest fan and the garlic bread was okay. 2.5/5  SALTED CARAMEL PUDDING ($7) - We had heard a lot of Yelp reviews mention this so we hoped it would make up for the entrees. It was what its name says: salty and caramel-flavored. The whipped cream added a nice sweetness to it. It was probably the best thing we ate here. 4/5  We really wanted to like the food here but we just couldn't get ourselves to like what we ordered."}
{"text":"This may have been the most average burger I have ever had. Came in on a Saturday night at 6 and was seated almost right away. The pretzel fondue was pretty good and we ate all of that. My burger on the other hand was awful, I didn't even finish it. I was surprised considering this is a Fox restaurant and I love their other spots."}
{"text":"We ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich, a cheese burger and fries.  The sandwiches and fries were well prepared and presented, the flavors good but not outstanding. Non of the dishes were 'the best we've ever had'.  Some of the disappointment may have stemmed from the slow and careless service we received.  We came in for a late lunch on a holiday.  There were plentiful wait staff and kitchen staff present but from the hostess to the waiter every part of the process seemed to be in slow motion. When the food did arrive the side dish and the sandwich toppings were not as ordered.  They did correct the side dish order but again in relative slow motion.  I would only come back here if I was looking for a pleasant place to idyll away 2 hours in downtown Phoenix.  I never saw the butcher and can't say if he really is arrogant."}
{"text":"The bartender was way cool, makes great drinks.  Good looking menu."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention and looking for a good place to go to dinner. I loved their diverse menu choices and everything we ordered was delicious. The service was efficient and good. Highlights were the Pretzel with Fondue appetizer and the Sweet Potato Tortelli (yes, The Arrogant Butcher has vegetarian menu options). I ordered the Chicken Stuffed with Crab...it was delicious and, but did not come with anything else...leaving it looking a bit lonely on the plate."}
{"text":"Great location and fantastic food.  Our group had the mussels, hummus and zucchini fritters all appetizers were a hit.  All three of us had the jambalaya and it was very good.  It had the right amount of kick to it.  Would definitely come back when I come to town again"}
{"text":"Wait staff were helpful and courteous and quick.  The food, however, was mediocre.  I chose the grilled salmon and was told that it would be cooked to a medium rare (which is perfect).  Unfortunately, the salmon was overcooked and charred at the edges (not even what I'd call a medium cook) and the potatoes were so overdone and mushy that there was little to distinguish between them and the mushrooms.  I could not have told you that there was a sherry mustard jus.  All in all, a disappointing meal...especially for $24."}
{"text":"The NY strip steak was prepared perfectly and was excellent. Everyone enjoyed all the food at our table, including all the desserts. The big standout for me - the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing Experience ... After reading the reviews and talking with friends , finally was goning to visit this place on my anniversary ... First of all ..they advised a 25 min wait ..hmm kinda suspicious because it was early and the place was dead .. I suspect a ploy to get you to the bar first .. the bartender was not friendly as I informed him that I left my glasses and couldn't make out the drinks menu ..offered no assistance or recommendations .. on to the food .. very bland with no taste ..limited selections and average service for price ... Won't go back"}
{"text":"Yet another delicious Fox restaurant.  Went here with co-worker for lunch.  We got some kind of delicious fritters and split the stew.  It was amazing -- and everything came in adorable colorful dishes.  I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We sat down and they were quick to ask us if we wanted drinks. The drinks came quick and we ordered our food. The place was at least 75% empty.  It took 40 minutes to get our basic food. The waiter told me the fish tacos came with 3 and was filling, so I did not order the jambalaya.  Guess what, there are only two very, very small tacos.  And, the fish was so dry I thought I was eating paper.    I suggest finding someplace else to eat if you want anything other than drinks or are actually hungry."}
{"text":"Came here with my best friend for drinks and appetizers. Took a really long time to be seated, despite there being multiple open tables on the patio.  When my friend pointed it out and said we'd be happy with an outside table the hostess was clearly put out.  Eventually we ended up sitting outside and luckily our mediocre service ended there... Our waiter was amazing.  We are what I think was the butcher's platter and it was a truly impressive meat and cheese plate.  I had an old fashioned but can't speak to how good it was, as if was my first one ever.  All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Straightforward and just plain good.  We popped in to get a quick burger before walking the the Crescent Ballroom which is about five short city blocks away.  You can easily take the light rail here by getting off at the station that is just east of Central.   The wife and I each had a burger, I had a local beer and she had a Hendricks Gin martini.  We sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender who was attentive, but not too into our business.  We had a night of drinking ahead, and he kept our water glasses full at every turn, which is something any good bartender should do instead of only focusing on the alcohol.    When ordering the burgers, the only choice was the side (fries, coleslaw or side salad).  So not cooked to order, just cooked.  We liked the simplicity.  I had the side salad, which just came tossed with a house vinaigrette that was great.  While I was surprised that I wasn't offered a choice of dressing, I liked that I didn't have to give a bunch of specifics-- I loved just ordering the burger and not having to make a bunch of choices.   I am the type of customer that like to experience the food as the cook/chef decides to put it together.  I am not picky and often find that leaving those decisions to the chef make it more fun for me.    The place is very clean, and the kitchen is open-air, right in the middle of the restaurant.  You can watch as they prepare every item.  Everything was priced reasonably.  The special was prime rib at $25 a plate.  The burgers we had were $10 each, the beer was under $6, and the Hendricks martini, which was basically a double was $13.50.  All well worth it for the quality.  The burgers were fantastic and the fries were fresh cut and crispy."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just ok. We have been to several of the Fox restaurants and this one just didn't seem to meet up to the expectations of the others. I felt like it was really high priced for food that didn't seem special. The ribs were really good, but not much different than others that I have had. The Chicken with crab was not bursting with flavor.  Service was great. Good drink options, really fun atmosphere, just not a favorite overall."}
{"text":"PROS: Excellent value; many and varied menu choices; a well managed thoroughly professional operation; comfortable setting. CONS: In some aspects might be perceived too \"formula\", as a dining factory.  4-AMBIANCE: A large open dining room with a hip urban vibe, high ceilings and a variety of comfortable seating options; good lighting and acoustic levels. 3-SERVICE: Proficient, attentive and no-nonsense but with the feeling that both maximizing the tab as well as achieving a quick table turn are priorities. 3-FOOD: Generously portioned appetizers of tasty fried shrimp with spicy aioli and pretzel buns with provolone fondue were easy, and more then adequate, for the entire table to share; the good sized cut of roast prime rib (Saturday night special), served with horseradish and excellent truly decadent Dauphinoise potatoes, was disappointingly chewy; BBQ baby back ribs offered with coleslaw and well prepared fries were well flavored but some might wish they were more \"fall off the bone\". 4-VALUE: A broad range of menu options presented at reasonable costs, especially in consideration of consistently generously sized portions results in outstanding values; one could easily eat from just the appetizer/charcuterie or salad/soup menus and still be fully satisfied. 4-OVERALL: A quality dining experience for and within reach of the masses.  WHAT WE ATE: Crispy Shrimp; Pretzel Fondue; Prime Rib; BBQ Ribs.  WHAT WE WISH WE ATE THAT WE DIDN'T: Smoked carnitas nachos; smoked salmon rillette; beef short rib stew; king crab cioppino; chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Love this place, cool, hip, lots of downtown folks in there for lunch. It mellows out for dinner. Really outstanding food. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Short on the menu, great on the plate.  Hit this spot for a work lunch. Wait staff sat us quickly, then got us drinks shortly after sliding into the booth and taking orders.  Food came out together, about ten minutes after ordering.  Little on the loud side.  Food options are on a brief menu. Our group had various salads options and the tortoli (sp?).  The latter is a ravioli-type pasta, plus a heart attack. Amazingly tasty with a very rich filling.  Probably a pound of butter in the dish.  I received some good advice to order it with the chicken to balance the meal out and that was dead on.  Those in our group who had the salads spoke highly of them, as well.  Fun place and one to visit, again."}
{"text":"The food here is always good! This is probably the 4th time I've eaten here but I waited to review in order to try more options on the menu. I recently visited and had the $44 option meal which came with one glass of wine, one entrée, one salad, and a dessert. The appetizer was the Mediterranean salad. The vegetables and salad were fresh and the salad dressing was perfect for this salad. The entrée was chicken stuffed with crab with capers and sauce. The entrée was really good with plenty of flavor. That dessert was a blueberry cheesecake in a cup. It was very very delicious. Since the only options for the wine was a glass of Chardonnay or a glass of Cab-  I decided to purchase my own on the side for eight dollar glass of Malbec. That was probably the only thing I didn't like about the meal was that I didn't get to choose what type of glass of wine I wanted. Other than that the meal was great would definitely recommend the $44 option. Great all around atmosphere"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service excellent. A little price but i did order the fish in Arizona."}
{"text":"This has not been my favorite restaurant and ambiance I would immediately connect with - but for some reason I felt like I should keep returning, giving in another chance (maybe the salmon appetizer has something to do with is). I guess closeness to Blue Hound (one of my favorites) made it a natural second stop with pleasant walk through the City Scape. Last time we came for later dinner Saturday 9pm - we were seated ordered food (that was not very good except oysters - surprisingly wonderful). After 15 mins of our plates being laid down on the table THE LIGHTS CAME UP - to announce that it is time for us to go. This has not happen to me for 10 years - I was feeling like teenager who should be spanked and feel guilty for drinking on Saturday night at quarter to 10pm!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time to have appetizers before a company party. Loved it so much we booked dinner reservations for our anniversary. GREAT FOOD"}
{"text":"A group of us were in Phoenix for a weekend of Dodger Spring Training games.  We had just arrived and we were in need of some really good food and drinks (especially the drinks part).  One of our group checked Yelp and after seeing (and reading) the great reviews we packed up our rental and headed to The Arrogant Butcher.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  We were off to one side of the restaurant (probably due to the size of the group) and that was just fine.  We were a little noisy.  Chris was our server.  He has a great personality and was the perfect fit for a group like ours.  He recommended some drinks and appetizers, took our beverage order and was back in no time with a tray of cold drinks for all of us.  We only ordered one appetizer-the Pretzel bites with cheese fondue.  Very Yummy!!  Our orders were all over the board, sandwiches, burgers, salads and entrees.  All the meals were delicious.  I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and loved it!  No desserts so I can't give a review there but we were so happy we choose this restaurant.   I can't say enough about Chris.  He was informed about the menu and drinks, provided quick service, and had a spontaneous wit that had us busting up with laughter.  We only get to Phoenix once or twice a year but we will definitely be coming back to The Arrogant Butcher when we are here."}
{"text":"Went there last night, got the meatloaf and simple chopped salad and both were delicious! Loved the vinaigrette on the salad!  The meatloaf was nice and moist, on a smooth potato purée. Maybe the sauce on the meatloaf was a little on the sweet side, but I didn't hate it.  Great service, nice ambiance, and the $5 wine for happy hour wasn't awful. I'd totally go back!"}
{"text":"I don't see why people don't like this place. The location is great and the prices are great too. They have a lot of fun and different options. Their drink selection is also great. Sure their prices for drinks are a little on the higher side, but this is downtown Phoenix so come on people. I love the atmosphere of this place. The bathroom is really cool too. I ordered the beet salad and it was pretty good, minus it was soaked with salad dressing. But hey, maybe some people like that. Our waitress was attentive and we didn't feel rushed at all. The turkey pastrami sandwich was also really good. Overall, I recommend this place to someone looking for a place to eat in downtown Phoenix. Parking sucks since it is downtown Phoenix, but sometimes you get lucky."}
{"text":"Made a reservation in advance for early NYE.  First visit... started with the Blood Orange Paloma, but with vodka rather than tequila.  I could have drank ten.... superb!!  Ordered pretzels/Provo fondue to start.... large portion, but cheese was missing something.  Maybe I just am a sharp cheese snob.  ?. I ordered the filet, hubs ordered salmon with chopped salad.  The champagne dressing was the high point of the meal.  It was delicious!!! Salmon was perfect, filet was cooked perfect (med-rare) but not as tender as I would have expected for $38.  No complaints at all for the food.  Service was exceptional, but $150 for three cocktails, one dinner salad, one appetizer and two entrees seems overpriced.  For that amount, I should have just gone back to Steak 44.  But, I'd go back again just for the chopped salad."}
{"text":"very very good.  Yes, it costs a bit more than other \"lower\" restaurants, but the doting waiters are great.  Very helpful staff, always ready, but not \"in your face\" as some do.  Had the surf and turf, which was very good.  crablegs (already shelled) and a good portion of bone-in ribeye grilled to perfection.  The mixed drinks weren't watered down, and the coffee great, especially with the chocolate cake.  It was my first time there, and definately will be going back."}
{"text":"4 stars for ambiance. 3 stars for food.  3 stars for service.   Overrated and overpriced... ouch! I ordered my waitress' favorite the $22 scallops and man-o-man was I disappointed. It's definitely one of those hit or miss dishes. The people next to me loved and raved about the scallops, but I was left unimpressed. My party enjoyed the pretzels and their meal, but my experience was non too pleasing. My friend even said he'd bring a girl here on a date. The other friends in my party enjoyed their time here. It's either hit or miss with some people, and it is a definite miss with me. Nice interior decoration though!"}
{"text":"we went here for dinner on a Saturday night and got there early. The wait was only about ten minutes. We started with crispy shrimp appetizer which was delicious and the sauce that comes with it is fabulous. I had prime rib and my date had sea bass the prime was very good as were the scalloped potatoes that came with the only downside was that the au jus was very bland. I tasted the sea bass which was also very good. The service was a little slow but this could be because the place was very full. I did not see an empty table in the place when we left and I heard someone say the wait was over an hour. I guess it was a good thing I got there early. I will go back for sure next time I will either make a reservation if they take them or arrive early again."}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue was crazy good as was the Wednesday special meatloaf.   Father in law enjoyed his raw oysters and the beers were cold and tasty.   Perfect place to go before the diamond backs game."}
{"text":"Nachos are so good! Blood orange Paloma was exactly what I expected. Server was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient."}
{"text":"Good ambiance and nice location.  Food was good except we had hair in our appetizer.  They did correct it after awhile.  Kinda shock they didn't compensate us for it.  I did find that unusual for a restaurant of this perceived caliber.  They did apologize which was nice.    Update:  The manager contacted me about my review within an hour.  She told me there was a mix-up and our bill was corrected like it should have been.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"Just went here with my girlfriend. Good service. Good food. Repeat customer. However, I left my credit card and literally came back 5 minutes later and the manager and the front desk girl were rude to me saying they don't have it and it is not in their books. How is that possible? I just left and they had to of picked up the card w the receipt. Very upset and WILL NOT be coming back. In terms of a fox concept restaurant I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Waiting for Arrogant Butcher to open, my patience was low, apprehension was high, and excitement was through the roof. Finally, the day has come when it was mine to try. Fox Concepts are hit and miss with me, as some of the ones I love are super cheesy (Olive and Ivy, Modern Steak, Bloom), and some that I don't love are ones that are extremely popular (Sauce, Blanco, and Zinburger.)  What sets Arrogant Butcher apart from the rest is it is the first downtown Phoenix restaurant that Fox RC has put out there. I'm sure they are nervous, and you can tell that from the design of the restaurant... it's much smaller than normal like they are testing the waters, yet in other ways it excels in the money spent meter. Three beautiful private dining rooms, a chef's counter facing the exhibition kitchen which they spared no expense on, and a great four sided bar in the middle. The atmosphere is a definite throwback to the 40's and 50's, which is nice considering you can't find that in many places downtown. It's truly a feel of an old tavern and restaurant.   Arrogant Butcher went out of their way to support local. Almost all of the beers on the tap as well as on the bottle list are Arizona breweries, there are pictures all over the restaurant of historic Phoenix landmarks and famous people, and they have done a great job of engaging the street with the patio and entrance. Yup, Sam Fox, the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants, brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community.  As for the food, all apprehensions were set aside when the bowl of mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder, roasted grape tomatoes, and french fries came to the table. The dish was outstanding and had me wishing I could drink the broth. My main course of the crab stuffed chicken, served cordon blue style, with myers lemon and capers was also a very well executed dish. It was served with sauteed spinach underneath which I ate ridiculously quick. Other items on the menu sounded great, and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses, as well as a daily special that rotates weekly, and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch. The desserts are fantastic as well, especially the peanut butter cup dessert, which is not served the way you would think it is, and includes cookies for dipping.   So no, this restaurant is not a locally owned, mom and pop style place, but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing, set in a location that could really use something of it's type, with the power to draw people in by the numbers. My biggest impression? on the first dinner service night, there were absolutely no hiccups in service. Our waitress, bussers, and drink people were all absolutely spot on. Keep it coming, Arrogance."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Scallops melted in my mouth. So delicious. I tried my husbands crab stuffed chicken and that too was awesome. Lemony, caper-y, and crabby. The spinach on the side was a perfect compliment. Our waiter, Nana(sp?) was very nice, soft spoken, and prompt. He made great recommendations, including the hot chocolate cake with chantilly cream. Everything we tried was distinct and wonderful. We had a great evening!"}
{"text":"This is an extremely friendly and fun atmosphere. A super cleanly place with fast service! The food surpassed my expectations. I recommend trying the crispy buffalo chicken thighs for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to going back, with lots more friends, we had lots of left overs. Intelligent flavor pairings. The boards are my favorite kind of dining."}
{"text":"Excellent place, and although I am not supposed to eat bread I had to try the pretzels. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night with no reservations at 7 pm and was seated immediately, which was nice. It did get busier with a herd of conference guys showing up, but they were put into a private dining room.  Open kitchen concept was fun to watch and the overall decor was industrial/loud but it worked.  Drinks: nice selection of specialty drinks. I had the Rhubarb Collins, made with vodka, rhubarb bitters and fresh lemon. It was delicious.  Wine selection was varied with prices from $8 - $12/glass.    Food: we ordered the pretzel nuggets w/cheese because I'd had them at Culinary Dropout and knew they were addictively good. They did not disappoint, and my friend who'd never had them before was beside himself once he tasted them. Simple, but brilliantly executed and you should order them.   We weren't terribly hungry, so we ordered a bunch of meats and cheeses with accompaniments. The quality of the food was okay, but the quantity was very small (except the bread - there was LOTS of bread).  The cheeses were $5 each,  quite reasonable in price, but the portion of each one was TINY. I'm talking a 1 inch x 1 inch block of each cheese. Meats were okay, but pate lacked the black truffle punch the description advertised.  I order a lot of meat/cheese plates wherever I go, and this one does not stand out as one of the better ones.  The one good thing was that you can build your own, even with accompaniments, so you don't get any stuff you don't like.  Service: friendly, but more than once I had to flag down someone to ask them for more drinks and other items we needed.  Waiter seemed overwhelmed even though at that point the restaurant had cleared out quite a bit.   Would I go back?  No.  I prefer Culinary Dropout and Blanco out of the Fox restaurants. In that Central Phoenix area, I would go to Hanny's a block away next time. Swanky!"}
{"text":"We had wonderful dinner and the service was wonderful.  We were attending a concert and the waiter was concious of time.  My husband ordered the jambalaya and is still talking about it.  I had a fabulous salad. I recommend making a reservation. The wait is long because the food is great."}
{"text":"The place is a bit crowded and getting a table can take a while. The food is delicious. Highlights include the pretzel appetizer and the Thursday fried chicken."}
{"text":"Yep, it's good.   A restaurant doesn't get 4 stars out of 500+ reviews for nothing.   Went here with coworkers after a long, hard day of standing around looking busy at the Travel Goods Association International Luggage Show at the Phoenix convention center. Tired of candy, pretzels and food court food we decided to venture out into the night on foot to the Arrogant Butcher. I called ahead and easily made a reservation for 5 people. We walked to the restaurant from the Hyatt across the street from the Convention Center and it took us probably 7 minutes to get there. Easy walk, and thankfully not a bad part of town (although they sure do roll the sidewalks up early in Downtown Phoenix, it was pretty dead and it was only 7:30).  When we arrived, we were greeted and immediately seated. The decor is casual, but not too casual that you wouldn't consider having a business lunch or dinner there. We ordered the Black Mussels as an appetizer, they were very good. The spicy salumi and tomato broth was flavorful and rich. I only wish they had served the Mussels with a little more bread. When there's a good broth it's such a shame to not have bread to dip in it.   I also had the \"Gin and Sexy Tonic\", which was yummy. Nothing remarkable, but I've literally never met a G&T I didn't like so I have no complaints about the drink at all.   A coworker and I were each torn between the same two dishes, so we decided each to order one and share them. She ordered the New York Strip and I ordered the Scallops. Both we fantastic. The scallops were cooked perfectly and served with the tastiest roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts and some kind of puree that I can't remember, and garnished with slices of tangerine.   The New York Strip was wonderfully tender and cooked to medium rare, like my coworker ordered. It was served pre-sliced, which made it very conducive for sharing, and I don't think any flavor or succulence was lost on account of the meat being pre-sliced. Unlike G&Ts, I HAVE met steaks I didn't like, but this steak was not one of them. I liked this steak a lot.   For dessert, we order one each of the Salted Caramel Pudding, the \"Hot Chocolate\" Cake and the Blueberry Cheesecake. They're served in little jars, which is cute.   Let me just say- that salted caramel pudding was DIVINE. Absolutely divine. Blessed and sanctified by the pudding gods, a holy union of sweet and savory in a little jar and, ultimately, in my mouth and in my tummy. Hallelujah.   Hot Chocolate Cake was good, but not extraordinary. I can make a very similar chocolate molten lava cake that's at least as good at home (let me know if y'all want the recipe, it's beyond easy and very impressive for dinner parties!), and I can make like a dozen of them for as much as it cost us to order this one cake. But I digress. If you're a chocolate lover there's nothing wrong with this cake and it will satisfy your chocolate tooth.   Blueberry Cheesecake-- I have to say I was disappointed. The kind of cheesecake I like is the thick, dense, heavy \"I might just be eating a block of cream cheese\" kind, and this cheesecake did not deliver in that respect. It was one of those whipped cheesecakes, more like a mousse than a cheesecake really, so I took one bite and lost interest and went back to the holiest of holy Salted Caramel Pudding.   All told (and by this I mean including tax and tip and everything), the bill worked out to about $200 for one appetizer, 2 drinks, 5 entrees and 3 desserts. Not bad, really, considering that the food was high quality, heftily apportioned and very tasty.   The verdict: The Arrogant Butcher is a great place to go and grab some dinner, be it with friends or colleagues, if you're willing to spend a little extra dough to make it a memorable and delectable meal.   To Go or Not to Go:  Get your butt over there if you're in the area and thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is right across from the US Airway arena. Drove to downtown Phoenix pulled up Yelp and was like this place looks good lets go there.   Nice sports bar vibe. Check the pictures and menu trying to figure out what I was going to get. Two things kept showing up. The hot soft pretzels with provolone fondue, salted caramel pudding and the Sweet potato tortelli.   I figured one out of three isn't bad so I decide yes on the pretzels and picked the fish and chips for lunch.   I tried to fight it. I'll be damn if the pretzels are really good. I figured it would be good but not like everyone was saying but after eating 4 without even noticing I have to admit they are really delicious .   Fish and chips are cool and the fries were tasty. The fish being halibut is a bit too buttery for me. I think a whiting would have been better or something a tad bit stronger tasting.   Next time I return I will get the Tortelli and dessert and if they are as good as everyone say I will upgrade them to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Service was great and friendly. The food was ok. I was expecting better tasting food since it was a fox restaurant. I guess I just have high expectations because I go the Henry a lot and their food is always awesome."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this new restaurant. It is a perfect location for a pre-game visit.  I was pretty disappointed that this place wasn't more exciting.  The bartenders were nice enough, the waiter we met recommended the Fondue which was delicious and the menu seemed intriguing, but nothing special.  I guess I was hoping for innovative, different and fun.  It was just a regular restaurant with a nice vibe and amazing fondue!"}
{"text":"On our staycation to Phoenix, we were drawn to this place by the name and menu options. I will say the Butcher has a reason to be Arrogant.  For our appetizer we order the smoke salmon dip. It had a pickled relish that really made it pop with yummy flavor. The entree I picked was the chicken stuffed with crab. I will tell you now that the name is a bit misleading.   When one thinks of stuffed chicken, it's usually a single chicken breast cut in the center stuff with filling. It was actually crab sandwiched between two cuts of chicken. Don't take that as a complaint, because it's not. I actually like that better than what I thought I was going to get. It gave me well seasoned crab that was surround by juicy chicken that also has that grilled crispness. The meal also had a butter sauce with capers. I am a sucker for capers, they just add a great vinegary type tang to dishes that makes me want to gobble the whole thing up.....which I did.   So in short:Go Here."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out while staying in downtown Phoenix. The place is pretty cool it's within walking distance from the hotels and attractions in downtown Phoenix. Great place for happy hour and comfort food. Everything on the menu is made in house from scratch."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix for work and came here for lunch the morning I landed with friends from all over the country. Sounded interesting but the menu was pretty small and limited. I ended up ordering the pate and brie. They were accompanied by nice, crusty bread and homemade mustard and jam. I enjoyed it but being that it was the only thing that really appealed to me, I wouldn't think to go back. The prices for sandwiches and salads were on the high side. The quality seemed good based on what I saw being served at my table and our server, who we were all convinced was way too happy for his own good, was attentive and pleasant to say the least but just not my type of joint."}
{"text":"Really good. Soft Pretzels $5 during happy hour were great.  Tear in half for dipping so you get enough cheese sauce. French Dip was yummy.  Beef was juicy and awesome, horseradish all zingy in my sinuses.  Great overall meal!"}
{"text":"Not often will I start a review with the following statement... Their salad with the champagne dressing was fantastic. It's 103 outside and this was light and refreshing. The deviled eggs were awesome and the BLT was great. All in all, next time in Phoenix, I'll try to make it back.   Well, I was able to make it back and it is just as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"My daughter picked this restaurant based on the reviews on Yelp. Yelp came through for us again!  This restaurant was delicious and the service amazing too. Ask to be seated in Ty's section if he is working. He made great suggestions and we followed his advice.  Everything he recommended was superb. We started with the Butcher's Board and ended with the Peanut Butter dessert. Both excellent. My daughter had the fish tacos and said they were the best she ever had. I had the crab stuffed chicken which was more like 2 chicken breasts with a crab cake in between them. I highly recommend this gastronomic experience!"}
{"text":"It seems like most everyone else has had a much better experience than we did. My partner and I went to Arrogant Butcher for dinner Christmas Eve. The service and food started out great, but it all fell apart when it came to the entrees. They did adjust the bill, but the way they handled the situation was very poor.  We started with an Antipasti appetizer consisting of two cheeses, one meat and marinated olives. The waiter assisted with our selections and it along with our drink order came promptly. The appetizer was delicious.  When the entrees came my partner's steak, which was ordered medium well, was burnt to a crisp. The server even asked him what he thought of it and said they already had another steak cooking for hm since this one looked overcooked.   Why bother bringing food to the table that you know isn't right? Now I had my dinner and while he technically had food he was waiting for the replacement. At his suggestion I ate my dinner and of course finished before he received his.   The biggest issue was the overcooked steak. A couple small things were the side of grilled asparagus I ordered came chilled. I asked and that's the way they prepare it. Grill it, then chill it. That should have been disclosed as I've never heard of that type of preparation before. My glass of wine I ordered \"with dinner\" came half way through my meal. Again, poorly executed.  We still had a nice evening despite the missteps by the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very cool ambiance and probably one of the better places in Phoenix. Beef stew was okay (tasty but hard to differentiate from other stews). Prawn appetizer was awesome. Service is sweet"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Downtown Phoenix.  I've stopped here a couple times before a D-backs game and I've never left disappointed!  The homemade Sea Salt Chips are tasty!  The Turkey Pastrami is delicious on a pretzel roll.  I recommend the Turkey Sloppy Joe.  With a slice of green chili, this sandwich has a kick!  This is a great place for a quick bit with friends."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars: Good service, great location, but I felt that the food was a bit over priced and not a good value. The food that we ate was excellent, but not sure I would be willing to pay the price for that portion size/quality"}
{"text":"Loud outdoor area, but I liked this place. Cool Vibe, nice wait staff, and the food was good too. I was sorry I wasn't able to indulge in their full bar and extensive drink list. Next time!"}
{"text":"My entire experience was phenomenal. The pork and beans were slow cooked and fell right off the bone. The scallops were perfection and our service was exceptional. I have never had a dessert as original as the peanut butter cup in a long time. All in all this was a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Came here expecting a decent spread of steak and meat, but the name was misleading. Legitimate meat options start at $25, which is fine if there was much diversity. There isn't. Anyhow, we were walk by customers, and saw a happy got A-Frame sign out front. Unfortunately, when we tried to order happy hour deals, the waiter told us that there is no Saturday happy hour. That's unfortunate, because we were not only let down by the name, but also the happy hour attraction. Apparently the specialize in cheese plates with some meat niblets. Hardly what I would expect from an arrogant butcher. The service was fine, only thing saving it from one star."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and met the Arrogent Bartender  I asked for horseradish. It took 10 minutes and never came. I had to go around to the other side of the bar and pick it up myself. I think if I was 20 to 30 they would've brought it to me but I'm way older, so they ignored me."}
{"text":"Slightly over priced but good.  We started off the the Brie plate, which came with bread and cherry preserves. The preserves with the Brie was super good!  My husband had the turkey sloppy joe and I had the turkey pastrami. Both were really good. The turkey pastrami came with a lot of turkey! The sandwiches were decently priced, around $10-12. The entrees do get significantly more expensive.   We ended up coming back a little later to meet up with some friends. They ordered some pretzels and other appetizers. The pretzel fondue bites were so good! If I wasn't already stuffed, I could have ate more.  One thing, do not order the peach Hefeweizen. Usually like Hefeweizen beer, but this one was not good."}
{"text":"The little lady and I have been to the Arrogant Butcher countless times, it is one of our downtown standbys that we visit time and time again. Usually we go for happy hour, but this time we went for a basic dinner. Some family was in town for the holidays, and wanted to try something new. We suggested one of the two new great pizza places downtown, not thinking that some places are closed on a Monday night. After getting downtown and paying $10 for parking (there was a Suns game), we realized our mistake. Luckily just steps away The Arrogant Butcher saved the day.   We started our meal for six with pretzels (one of our favorites), oysters (we have been told by an insider that they are flown in daily, and the quality backs it up), and hummus. All were excellent and quickly devoured by the table. For entrees, our group chose the pork chops, two orders of the short rib stew, the scallops, the crap stuffed chicken and the chicken stroganoff. I had previously thought the stew was the best thing on AB's menu, but I had never had the pork chops before. I may have to reevaluate that ranking. The chops were moist and flavorful. They had a breading on them that was crunchy and done really well. Paired with the mashed taters and veggies, this dish was epic. The stew has a nice little kick and is served with a slice of cornbread, both dishes are amazing. The pairing with the scallops was a little weird (I don't get the whole brussels sprouts thing yet), but they were cooked well and tasty. We have had the scallops in the past which were prepared differently, and we thought they were great. I was told the crab to chicken ratio was a little off, but the dish was good otherwise. I didn't taste it myself though to verify.   All in all, a great experience as always, great food, great service. They did well and impressed our out of town guests."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Tortellini!!!!  A must if you go see the Butcher.  So delicate and flavorful!  My BF got the Short Rib Stew, neither of us were fans.  It was the opposite of the tortellini--heavy and bland.    Great atmosphere and service.  Perfect for dinner before a basketball game or concert!"}
{"text":"Pricey but yummy!!  Always good service no matter how busy. Good wine selection and excellent food!!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! We were visiting from out of town and this place came highly recommended. The food was good and the atmosphere is really fun. I ordered the sweet potato tortellini and it was good but it was very heavy on the buttery sauce. A little to much for my taste but it was still decent."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service even better! Our food ran a little (very little) late and they comp out wine-which was also very delicious! Service knew their stuff about the food and adult beverages. A little expensive but well worth it, especially when vacationing!! :)"}
{"text":"We dined on a Saturday evening. Our reservation was for 5:45, but we arrived about 10 minutes early and were seated promptly.   Started with the pretzel fondue. Delicious! We split it 3 ways, and still couldn't finish.  For entrees, the table ordered:  Sweet potato tortelli: perfect dish. Tender little pastas pillows filled with sweet potato, and served with mushrooms, spinach and hazelnuts. The sauce was both creamy and buttery. I can't come here and NOT order this dish. Short rib beef stew: my husband's pick was served in a charming little pot. He said the stew had a little heat to it, and thought the egg served on top was a nice touch, as was the corn bread muffin that accompanied his dish. Meatloaf: our friend ordered this dish and seemed pleased. He wasn't able to finish his meal. It was a generous portion.  The bill for 3 entrees, an appetizer, 2 beers and 1 mixed drink came to just over $90.   We enjoyed the atmosphere, and the service was excellent. We will return."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  The server recommended her favorites and we ordered both and they offered to split them for us to try both.  Bothe were out of the park!  My wife even liked the cole slaw, and she hates cole slaw.  Start with the pretzel and fondue appy, it's fantastic.  Come hungry, nothing is bad!  Oh, and she brought me a to go cup of their delicious iced tea.  Killer service"}
{"text":"Excellent- very fresh, delicious eats and great cocktails! Friendly service and modern upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Can it get any better! Sheesh! Fox Restaurants does it again!"}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue and short rib stew were perfect for a storming summer evening. The stew was absolutely packed with flavor, flavor that's difficult to justify with words."}
{"text":"The food was ok...once we got past the rude host at the front (maybe the maitre d'  - a tall guy with a mustache & little beard). We arrived at 3:52 pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant was nearly empty. There were 7 of us with 3 more coming. The host asked if we had reservations, we said no, we'd been at an event & were going to the game.   He said he couldn't seat us as there were others who DID make reservations. (yes, he said it as if it were in CAPS!) We had to ask if the patio (which is huge & has misters) was available - yes. Then we asked if we could have a table inside if we promised to be gone by 5. He reluctantly agreed.  When my wine arrived, there was an insect in it. Our. Waiter was nice & replaced it.  The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers. I had the Antipasta which was very small, and only came with 2 small pieces of bread. It did come with tart cherry preserves which were great.  A friend had the Tabbouli salad, which was ok, and another had the Salmon Rillette which was good. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.   When We left promptly at 5, the restaurant was still half empty. I had looked forward to trying this restaurant... but I probably won't go back due to the rude host turning away patrons from an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Highly recommend chef selection charcuterie board. Out first waiter wasn't very informative with what's on it, but it was definitely worth it for the price. Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Food cost is way inflated for the portion size I brought my girlfriend and I to eat and 55$ later we both left hungary had to go to Mcdonalds before the concert will never go back"}
{"text":"Good food. Have some of the crazy cheese for an appetizer. Getting the check took a while, but otherwise service was ok."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The wait is worth it. I like the downtown location, a lot going on and the patio is nice. Service is good, nothing special. Does have a trendy feel to it."}
{"text":"Went here after Trump went off in downtown Phoenix this past Saturday. Excellent service, awesome ambiance and even better food. I had the Cubano and the lady had the Asian Salad. Both delightful. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars if only for the food (etc.) The additional star is for the wonderfully cheery petite girl working behind the bar.   The experience started off odd as I guess I expected this spot to be a little more cool and quaint instead of situated next to a Tilted Kilt (the \"Scottish\" Hooters). I'm sure the ambiance is much better at night when there is controlled lighting versus the sun blazing in from all the windows. Anyways, my misconception and this has in no way affected my score.  Then it didn't help when I walked in on an employee standing up with the hostesses at the entrance loudly bitching about something. All seemingly in agreement. So I just interjected with an..\"I'll just eat the bar\", since I was rolling solo. Followed by an awkward look exchange with a member of staff standing behind the bar that I was now sitting at. It was something of a forced smile or perhaps he was squinting due to sun coming in from the window...either way he spoke no words.  Instantly things got better as my bar server approached to greet me and offer a beverage and a lunch menu. Such a cutie pie this one and nice as nice can be. And she never let my water get anywhere close to empty and I was drinking it like a fish.  Often I have trouble deciding on what to order and like to request the assistance of my server who has undoubtably eaten everything on the menu or at least has seen it, so I ask the ray of sunshine which she preferred out of the smoked salmon and the crispy shrimp. Without hesitation she informs me, \"crispy shrimp!\", her favorite thing. Sold. And I also order the simple chopped salad ($5)  Well if that was the best thing I worry about the rest of the menu. Sure they came out hot and crispy but there was very little flavor. I actually had to salt them. ( perhaps they took Angie M.'s review to heart too soon). The sauce was good but only when used sparingly. The portion was generous but for $13 bucks that should not just be \"filling\".   The simple chopped salad was alright but very overdressed, rather soggy and the vinegar level in the dressing made my lips burn a bit. It was also topped with a powdered \"cheese\" similar to that that comes in packets with delivery pizza.  I left full but thinking I made the wrong decision on where to eat, because it was not worth the 24 bucks it cost here for lunch. If this restaurant is smart though they will never let go of that little girl behind the bar. She is a gem."}
{"text":"What a surprise on the 4th of July! I have been wanting to visit the Arrogant Butcher for years. Boy did it not disappoint. Great restaurant and location. The ambiance is fantastic.  Now to the highlights - the service from Meagan was outstanding. Her recommendations were spot on! One of the best servers I have had in years! We had the burger, ribs and steak salad. To top it off, we had the warm chocolate cake. All the food was delicious and top notch.  Lastly, we gave some positive feedback to Elias, the manager and he was great. We discussed other FOX restaurants around town.  I have to say I am very impressed with the FOX organization and Meaghan and Elias must be valuable members of their team!"}
{"text":"Once again based on the reviews, I find that people are more interested in environment than the food.   The environment was very hip and somewhat retro.  The service was great.  The happy hour wine was very good.   The homemade pretzels were good. Everything else was average.  The fondue dish for instance was a 100% velveeta replica that is unbecoming of a restaurant like this and certainly not worthy of being called fondue.    The dessert, a hot chocolate cake that they told me was a lava cake was overcooked, had no lava, was barely warm, and was covered with a mountain of standard supermarket whip cream. Denny's wouldn't serve it.    In short, if you want a hip place to drink and hang out with friends, this place is for you.   If you are looking for great food and value that above all else, I would probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fuck me the steak is good.  Got mediocre service probably because we were dressed down but food was on point."}
{"text":"In from out of town with an appetite and this was a great spot! Kudos to the best app I've had in a while, the Pretzel Fondue! It's a must! Ordered the burger and it was cooked perfectly! Great staff too! Definitely coming back when I'm in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"After finding a few other downtown restaurants packed before a sporting event, we decided to give Arrogant Butcher a try.   We walked in around 5 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Soon after, we realized we had just barely beaten the dinnertime rush - score!  Since we weren't in the mood for gigantic meals, my fiancé and I opted to split the Jumbo Shrimp and Oyster apps and the Fish N' Chips plate. The shrimp arrived and were HUGE.. well worth the $3ish dollar/piece that they were priced at. Oysters were pretty standard in size and taste.   When our entree arrived at the table, I was happy to see that the kitchen had already split the Fish N' Chips onto two separate plates as the portion was quite large - Definitely enough to have 2 adults feeling quite full! The battered and fried fish arrived warm and had a lovely crispiness to them. The side of fries arrived warm and tasted freshly deep fried as well.  My only drawback is that as restaurant got busier, our waiter seemed to drop off with his service (for instance, we had to flag down another waiter for more cocktail sauce) and it seemed we waited a bit longer than normal for raw seafood apps. Otherwise, our experience was great and we'd definitely consider returning next time we are in DT PHX!"}
{"text":"AZ restaurant week!  Hurray!  Had the $30 3 course meal and it was excellent.  I loved the selections - especially the Kale salad.  good times for all."}
{"text":"We had a dinner at Arrogant Butcher Friday evening, when the ball game was not over yet, so we got a seat without any wait time. The Friday special (king crab cioppino, scallops, mussels, sea bass) was sufficient, creamy and nice. for $27 it is good for one person. And the Goddess Cesar Salad is also testy and creamy, not sure if there is parmesan cheese added. We feel that both courses are a little too heavy in terms of flavor. BTW, you can't miss the \"after school special\" cocktail too."}
{"text":"Meh  Tasteless food in an excellent atmosphere. If you want this style of food done right look to a place more like Chompies or even JAsons DEli. The food here is quite average at best."}
{"text":"Went back because I couldn't stay away. Try the filet... You won't be sorry. I literally said oh my God with every bite. I can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"First time Phoenix visitor and The Arrogant Butcher did not disappoint. The server was excellent. The waiter accidentally spilled a glass on our table (which wasn't that big of a deal because of the crazy dry heat) and gave us complimentary pretzels and cheese. The drinks are reasonably priced and everyone I dinned with that afternoon enjoyed their meals. I highly recommend the smoked carnitas nachos!"}
{"text":"We are from Las Vegas, and we have eaten a lot of amazing steaks at home - but this is literally the BEST steak I have ever eaten. The filet is crusty and salty, and cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Colby, said on Friday and Saturday's the grill guy \"bobby\" works and is the best grill master ever.   We also had the butcher platter and that was the best cheese and meat selection ever. It only included 2 cheese and 2 meats, but it also had bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, cherry marmalade, mustard and deviled eggs, plus the thick cuts of crusty bread with a balsamic drizzle. Unreal. Seriously so amazing.   We live 300~ miles away and we will come back to Phoenix just to come back to this restaurant. Can not miss."}
{"text":"i liked it and got a kick out of the name so wanted to try it. Pretty awesome:)))))))))))"}
{"text":"NY Strip and Prime Rib were done right. Service was good. Great location if your going to arena."}
{"text":"I have never had better service at any restaurant in the world. Colby was an exceptional server, everyone else were equally attentive. The food was delicious and well priced. We went two nights in a row and had tortellini, turkey sandwiches, beef short ribs (phenomenal)  when i requested a change to the menu and wanted plain chicken colby did not hesitate to accommodate my requests  the food was brought by friendly servers both promptly and all meals came at the same time  (At others restaurants they often arrive at different times!!). A memorable experience"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, a class act bar, and delicious appetizers! Can't wait to go again, oh and the waitress we had was amazing! Ask for Marlo, and go see Stephanie at the bar =)"}
{"text":"Service was great along with Prime Rib and New York Strip!"}
{"text":"Came here not once but twice while in town for a few days.  Arrogant Butcher epitomizes what I like to see in a gastropub: good quality upscale comfort food, unique drinks, edgy vibe, and friendly service. It's not cheap, but their happy hour (only on weekdays) from 3-6pm is a pretty fabulous deal. I had their chicken parmesan burger (decadent breaded chicken covered with primavera sauce and cheese) with fries the first time, and their \"pretzels\" (more like pretzel bread) with cheese and caesar salad the second time, along with a strawberry and thyme drink. I was only slightly disappointed with the pretzels with cheese (a huge basket of essentially bread...and cheese dipping sauce is not worth $10), but everything else delivered.  This place is popular: even on a random weekday afternoon it is surprisingly full. But service was reasonably fast, and generally always delivered with a smile. Definitely worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"Wow I took a friend here for his birthday it was amazing service and great food!! The warm peanut butter mouse with chocolate gelato was amazing!! A party in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Overall I'd say I'm closer to a four star with this place but based off my last experiance it was a 3 for sure.  My wife or buddies hit this place up when we go to Dbacks games so it's a 5 time a year place for sure.    Last time was just ok.  The place looks great for sure.  We had a weird service change at our table but it was for the better.  The second server had a lot more common sense and enthusiaum.  We went a different route and did sort of a seafood platter that was pretty great but also pretty hard to mess up (unless you're Bluefin or Kingfisher, yuck!) My salad was offered to be split which was nice but was packed full of ingredients that we're listed but to me a real \"game-changer\", cucumber and zuccinni.  Can't stand them.  Poorly dressed.  I'm not gonna raise a stink but I figured I would of been asked when i only took a bite or two and then voice my issue with the salad but no one blinked... oh well.    Pretzles are always great! I'll be back for sure... best option BY FAR around the stadium!  Next time it will be a four star, I'd bet my life on it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic date night. Made a reservation on Open Table and when we arrived we were immediately seated.   The standout of the night were the oysters. They were really fantastic. We tried the other items on the raw bar but when we go back, we'll skip the rest and just stick with the oysters.  The hubby ordered the prime rib; his favorite dish. He was really happy with the cut and the way it was prepared. The temperature was right on.   I ordered the cioppino. All of the seafood was perfectly cooked and the broth was really flavorful.  The service was really fantastic. Our server was very attentive and wouldn't let our water glass be less than half full despite him having a full section on a Friday night.  All said, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I'm giving them a 5 star because if you have any issues they will take care of it before you even leave. The drinks are great and the food is even better. If there were more than 5 stars I would give it. Thanks Elias!"}
{"text":"A short walk from Chase Field, we came here after a game to wait out the crowds and to eat a light meal with a couple of drinks. We were seated in a booth and it wasn't too packed as the game finished late. But the space is definitely big enough to handle the pre and post event rushes.  The menu covers a wide spectrum with varying entrees and sandwiches to a raw bar and charcuterie. The bar menu is highlighted by specialty cocktails and a list of beers with a decent number of local brews. Whatever your purpose, whether it be to pass time, enjoy their happy hour, or have a sit down dinner, Arrogant Butcher probably has the food or drink you're looking for.  My wife had a burger and I had the chicken stroganoff along with a couple pints of 4 Peaks Kilt Lifter. Both dishes were standard and there were no issues. Service was good as it could be for how busy it was. The price for our food and drinks was a fair $42 before tip."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a delicious dinner before a concert or sporting event. Small plates but very good. We started with the simple chopped salad, it was for one person but the champagne dressing was so yummy. We had salmon and the crab stuffed chicken. The salmon was delicious and we would order again. The crab stuffed chicken was good, but not sure I would order it again. Think I'm going to try the sweet potato tortellini next time. We didn't order them, but the nachos looked amazing!!!  Service was quick considering it was busy on a concert night and they got us in and out in a timely but reasonable manner. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary and had a great time.  The service was perfect, food was amazing and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"We had New York strip steaks. The food was good and the service was very attentive. A little pricey for what you get but overall a good experience. Be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Arrogant Butcher. Arrogant Bastard. Arrogant Butthole. I don't care what the name is, I had a really great time here. Finding it, however, was laughable. This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent.   But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing.   I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland.   But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had.   Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and the beer and appetizers were good, but I was mislead by the name. Was expecting some straight meat dishes or something out of the ordinary that a butcher would do but the menu was just like everywhere else."}
{"text":"Short rib stew was tasty! Service was mediocre to start but improved as the night went on.   I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 3 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp when traveling here for the RnR Marathon.  Service was excellent: hostess was kind, waitress was friendly, super knowledgable about the menu and fast. My ice tea was never empty nor was my man's beer. We sampled the pretzel bites (huge portion FYI), nachos (didn't sound yummy, but were delicious) and spicy shrimp app (good as well) . We intended to order dinner (menu looks outstanding), but the apps were too good!   The atmosphere is classy but chill and everything seemed to flow effortlessly, especially for a packed Friday night.  We would definitely return with friends or clients!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the food was fairly mediocre despite the great reviews. I got the burger and started feeling nauseated almost immediately after I finished it, but decided it was just a low blood sugar thing since I hadn't eaten yet that day. Once I got back to my hotel room the stomach cramps and physical sickness started. I have a sensitive stomach and no one else got sick so it could have just been my fault, but maybe avoid the burger or lunch menu if you go here :(   *GM was very polite and professional. Most likely it was just me having a weird reaction to the food"}
{"text":"Had the warm pretzel rolls and cheese fondue here....absolutely amazing. Best pretzel rolls I've ever eaten...so light. Oh God...so good! We had them as an appetizer; next time, I'll just have them for dinner."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. I had the burger which was really good. My sister had the jambalaya which she said was good but spicy. My mom and her friend both had the fish and chips which they also enjoyed very much. Everything was good."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! The food was amazing and our waitress was outstanding! It was our one year anniversary and she brought us each a glass of campaign (on the house), as well as the amazing caramel apple pudding. The experience was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a cocktail and dinner! The Long Legged Blonde cocktail was really tasty. For an appetizer, the artichoke hummus dip with pita bread is a great choice. For the main course, the grilled salmon was phenomenal. On top of the great food, the decor is really trendy and the wait staff is efficient in all they do. Come check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The restaurant was very clean. They have two rooms in the back for private parties. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was really good. However, I had to send back my steak because it was over cooked, I asked for medium well. The waiter was nice enough to send it back.  The drinks were amazing and the dessert was mediocre. The chocolate cake was dry and the salted caramel was pretty good. I wouldn't order dessert the next time around. But overall, it was a prettify good place to eat. I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Spent my birthday dinner here... chill ambiance. Had a nice room for larger parties. Friendly staff. Food: cheese & pate = okay. pretzel & cheese fondue = DELICIOUS! sweet potato tortellini = SUPER DELICIOUS! Overall, fun time and good food."}
{"text":"Service was great, staff very friendly and courteous, however a little overrated, mind you we all have an opinion. I ordered a side of grilled asparagus and a side of roasted peppers for 3$ each. The asparagus is served chilled with pepper and balsamic vinegar , but grilled first. Luckily I told them I just wanted mine served hot and grilled with olive oil and sea salt only and they were happy to do that. I assumed the roasted peppers consisted of a pepper cut in half, brushed with olive oil, spices/ sea salt, and then roasted, boy was I disappointed. The peppers were thinly sliced, much thinner then one would see on a vegetable tray. There were 4, maybe 5 red and yellow peppers grilled sitting in a small bowl of oil. There was more oil in the bowl then I would consume in 2 weeks. They would be better off seasoning and basting before grilling and serve an entire pepper cut in half. If you need to raise the price to 3.50$ then do so. They have decent food for the most part, just ask how things are served because it may not be what your expecting. I don't mind paying $ for good food, but the prices sure don't reflect their chief."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, must try salted Carmel dessert."}
{"text":"I stopped me here after learning about it a few hours before on Yelp.  I was trying to find a place downtown so that I can meet up my play step-dad ...lol, he was out in Phx on business (my mothers boyfriend-they have been together forever and a day) I thought what the hell let me check this place out. I love that the location was downtown. I am never  in downtown Phoenix on a Friday, so I thought it would be hella busy. Well well, it was hardly nobody down there. I guess I am use todowntown in Chicago (use to live there for some years before moving to Phx) or Los Angeles (grew up there, because these downtown cities are busy all the time.  Well, when we arrived there was no wait, well I did may reservation on Open Table, but still even if I hadn't we still would have been seated right away because it was not busy. I would guess if there was a game going on that day, it would have been a different story. Anyway, we ordered the pretzel bites with cheese, I thought it was good because I was hungry but after a well I found that the cheese was to heavy and thick for me, but still alright.  I had the jambalaya it was cool. I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant.  I just was not blowed away by this restaurant at all. It was not bad, I am just not sure if I will ever come here again. Maybe if I am downtown one day. I believe I was more blowed away by the simplicity of getting downtown and just hanging out down there."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. Noelle did a great job as did the hostess and other servers that helped her. very knowledgable about the menu, we never had to wait for a drink or food. everything came out hot and fresh. However, if the food had been as great as the service I would have given htid pace a 5. the food was 'just okay;. probably the berst thing we had at the tabel was the pretzel fondue."}
{"text":"Lots of reviews, A solid 4 stars. Why was I not feeling it? Well, the food we tried was good. We had the pretzels and cheese which was good.The zucchini fritters were was not what I thought it would be. The texture was the problem- It was shredded and then fried. Not firm. Sort of squishy. Then we tried the warm peanut butter dessert which my husband loved and I got the salted caramel pudding. It was ok. Not as DECADENT as Culinary Dropout (their sister restaurant) but it was lighter. The atmosphere was fine. Parking is a pain but it is for all downtown restaurants.  Maybe it didn't hit me because I couldn't read the menu. It was dim. The menu uses small print and a light thin font so you can't read it. Had to take out the phone flashlights to see anything. Not cool."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick snack before a Yelp event.  I had the chicken chili, and it was outstanding.  I asked for extra sour cream because I love a huge dollop of sour cream.  The chili was a medium spiciness which I enjoyed.  It had a very nice flavor.  I wanted to try other things, but needed to save room for the event.  It was a perfect quick snack.  The service was excellent!  I would like to return to try more things!"}
{"text":"Great downtown vibe, but not a great meal by any standards.  We sat at the bar and the server was attentive and friendly.  Since the Friday special was King Crab Cioppino, our taste buds were anxious...until it arrived and tasted like bland nothingness and not sure what happened to the King Crab since it was non-existent.  To the credit of the staff, they asked us if we liked it and we shared that it was tasteless and disappointing.  They immediately took it off our bill and offered to comp us a different entree...kudos to them for trying to make it right.  It was this action that kept this review from being a one star.  I'd go here again for an appetizer and a drink, but I'd suggest skipping the meal part and heading to a different place."}
{"text":"Ever have one of those days when you want to nibble on a whole bunch of stuff, rather than a full meal?  This is the place to be when you've got the nibbles, or munchies.   Each time I'm here it's Appetizers, never an entree. I'm sure the entrees are awesome, but I'm here to taste lots of flavours and textures, and to try something new.   The atmosphere really depends on when you're here. M-F, mostly workers from surrounding businesses. Nights and weekends are concert goers or locals who live nearby.   The wrap around patio has seats sturdy enough to hold big people like me and makes for great people-watching."}
{"text":"Seen the crab cioppino on yelp and had to try it but noticed it wasn't in the online menu =/ I ended up coming the day it was the special though and it was amazing! The service and atmosphere were on point also can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars for food, 3 for service and 4 for ambiance and convenience.  Again another downtown eatery that has taken me too long to try.  The interior is classic, clean, cozy, casual without being too slouchy and just enough class to keep you on your toes.  My mom was in town and we headed over for a simple dinner, we were greeted and seated quickly,  initially contemplating ordering from their charcuterie menu we decides on the burger and turkey sloppy joe, respectively, and split a small chopped salad.  The chopped salad was great!  Light fresh and crisp, tossed with the prefect amount of their house vinaigrette.   They made a little boo boo with the order, bringing my mom fish and chips and taking her burger to the next table but they eventually got it straight.  My turkey sloppy joe was tasty and I loved the roasted poblano pepper, the seasoning in the sloppy joe sauce was too much like the cumin laden taco seasoning I am not too fond of but it was still good. I was a big fan of the potato chips and the frys are quite crispy too.  I gave it 4 stars because I love having this quality addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, reasonably portioned. Celeste was our server and was fantastic! Very thorough and confident in everything she told us. It was our first time coming here and she was amazing at assisting us. Super friendly, always having a smile on her face. We enjoyed every minute of our time here and would definitely recommend Arrogant Butcher for date night!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but I thought very average. I had the short rib stew and could hardly find any short rib in it. My egg was a little overdone. The atmosphere is great and I love the location but I thought it was pretty pricey for average food. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great Food, AWESOME service. Would have 5 star except that the bar closes too early. The peanut butter dessert is ok."}
{"text":"Yuk! Over priced. Small portions. $27 for over cooked 3oz of SeaBass? Chicken Stuffed w/ Crab or was that tuna fish + crackers? You be the judge! Sorry Sam another bad experience totally $160 for 3 people + no alcohol."}
{"text":"I'm not a food critic... just a guy that likes to eat new/good food at a fun place. The food was delicious and it was a fun experience. Service was a little slow but nothing to complain about. Came here for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't crowed but busy enough to do some people watching. We sat out on the patio because it was nice out. They have a solid lunch menu with creative entrees, meats and cheeses, and unique sandwiches and salads. We ordered the humus appetizer and it was really good. It had halved cherry tomatoes and big chunks of artichoke heart and kalamata olives. I ordered the beef short rib stew (with green chile, white beans, and a fried egg on top) and it came with cornbread. I loved it. My lady ordered a salmon salad and liked it a lot. I ordered some of their house cocktails too and they were pretty good. I had the candlestick maker and the old fashioned. I was a little surprised the bill was $75 for lunch, but hey... it was worth it."}
{"text":"I chose the arrogant butcher for my birthday dinner this year.  Our reservation was about an hour before tip off so the restaurant was packed, but we were seated immediately because we had made a reservation.   Be sure and park at the City Scape Parking Garage on Washington just west of 1st St on the south side of the road.  A.B. will validate your parking for up to (2) hours so be sure and bring in your parking stub after parking in that garage.  We started out with the Pretzels and cheese Fondue along with the Crispy Shrimp. Both were delicious and I could see myself ordering again on another visit.  The cocktails were delicious and mixed well but were really pricey, most cocktails started at $10 and worked there way up to $14 a drink.    The fish and chips were amazing--perfectly cooked fish and the tartar sauce was really good.  My wife enjoyed her fish tacos, and my pops said the food was amazing. He ordered the daily special which was a fried chicken dinner.    I was treated to a complimentary dessert for my birthday, and I went with the Salted Carmel Pudding--wowser.  So rich and yummy, just the perfect night cap to end a delicious meal.S  All in all, the Arrogant Butcher was an awesome dining experience, with delicious food priced reasonably.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back.  Check Break Down: Table of five (6) Cocktails (2) orders of Fish Tacos (1) Fish and Chips (1) Jambalaya    (1) Fried Chicken Special (2) Appetizers (1) Comped Birthday Desert    $180, $215 after gratuity"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Early reviews were solid but I see why many have left poor reviews as of late. Atmosphere is nice and a great location downtown. In spite of this, management is doing a bad job at running the restaurant. They were out of half their tap beers as well as many of their bottled beers.  How does that happen?  I think alcohol and beer vendors deliver daily. I don't think I've ever seen that before other than maybe a backyard party at my buddy's. Service was extremely lackluster. Servers and food runners basically were doing us a favor by doing their job. Don't ask for a serving spoon to share a salad because if you do, they will give you stink eye, a deep sigh, and if you're lucky, give you a teaspoon.  The fish and chips were one level above Long John Silver. Actually LJS is better and their charcuterie is average at best with horrible presentation and delivery. The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the beet salad was terrific!  Other than that I would avoid this place at all costs. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the aggravation of dealing with staff that have no interest in making the customer experience enjoyable.  Go to Hannys down the street instead. Same type of eclectic menu with solid service and actually a fully stocked bar!"}
{"text":"We stopped in during peak hours, so the service was sub par, but the food was delicious as always.  We must have just been there at the wrong time.   I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Service was great. I liked my jambalaya except there was one random chicken bone in the jambalaya. I didn't complain but it definitely made me lose my appetite.  I am sure, had I complained they would have changed the bowl, hence not dinging them on it. Nice ambience. Definitely worth going at least once."}
{"text":"Nice franchise establishment.  Excellent creativity in a quite uncreative market space!  A bit uneven but attentive and caring service was consistent every time.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Clearly a Fox Concept.  It once had everything going for it with all that money behind it....  Food excellent, wine knowledge poor, bar staff medicre.    Honestly really enjoyed this place, maybe it was the company.  However we sat at the bar, bartenders not attentive or knowledgeable. Manager's wonderful during a fill-in where the brtender was injured.  I was happy with the food section seeing as I don't eat red meat and chicken.  Overall happier then the stars will allow, but not impressed.  Need wine knowledge for 'cork dorks', needs to be better for what it is expected to be....."}
{"text":"A great visit on a work trip. Ended up getting the Butcher's Platter that had a great selection of meats, and various delicacies.  Also had the fish tacos which were quite sizable and tasty.  Highly rated place with a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Pricing was what we expected and was appropriate for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly place.  Good place for pre-ballgame activities."}
{"text":"Nice location, you can park nearby and the ticket is even reimbursed later by restaurant. We had great crab stuffed chicken, scallops and yummy yummy hot chocolate cake. Good recommendations from waiters and nice service overall."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for a company lunch spot. We had a big group of about 14 employees come here during the busy lunch hours. Our server was quick, witty, and definitely knew how to describe everything on the menu. Must have aps are pretzels and cheese fondue plus the crispy shrimp. I ordered the butternut squash tortellini. Wow! It's was so flavorful and buttery! I am still dreaming of this dish. I highly recommend on coming back here to try their happy hour specials. Thanks Mr. Fox for another restaurant concept that I highly enjoyed."}
{"text":"We came for our last dinner in downtown. I made reservations since I wasn't sure how the crowds would be. It was a weeknight and we found parking quickly across the street at a meter. We walked in and we were immediately greeted by the hostess. I had changed my reservation, but they were quick to accommodate. We opted for indoor seating since it was still warm out. I think I would have enjoyed indoor seating anyways since the ambiance was nicer with the bar area and the nice indoor seating decor. The patio is great for people watching, but it was dead on a weeknight.  We ordered the beef short rib stew ($18) and the bbq baby back ribs ($24). Between the 2, I really liked the stew better. We asked for our egg to be over easy so that the yolk can drip into the stew. It was rich but delicious. The ribs were OK. Not much meat on the bones and I had to request more sauce (I like a lot of sauce with my ribs). The extra sauce doesn't come out warm, so you may want to ask for your sauce to be warmed up.  We had good service and had a great time at this happening restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner service!  We started with some fun, unique cocktails and the pretzels with fondue.  Then moved on to the market salad.  Dinner was sweet potato tortelli and the turkey sloppy joe.  A glass of chardonnay and a glass of syrah paired nicely with the respective dishes.  Then we finished it all with blueberry cheesecake.  Overall dinner was FANTASTIC.  And the service?  TOP NOTCH!  I think dinner could have been a flop and we still would have left with a good impression of the restaurant due solely to the level of service we received."}
{"text":"I've ordered the Taboule salad on two occasions and been very pleased, especially when I added chicken.  The crab cakes are the best in town as far as I'm concerned.  Not deep fried and crunchy, just quickly pan seared and soft in the middle.  My boyfriend had a tequila cocktail that was to die for while I found that the rasberry mojito left something to be desired.  The peanut butter cup dessert is melt in your mouth good and the service has been top notch on both occasions.  Add in the Butcher's modern but comfy styling and you've got a winner..  right here in downtown.  I'm taking my mom there for brunch on Mother's Day and I'm not sure who is more excited.. her or me."}
{"text":"Slow cooked prime rib is amazing - happy hour is awesome! this is a must try!"}
{"text":"I was relieved it wasn't chaotically busy as I anticipated for a Suns home game. Tried the pretzel & cheese appetizer and the hummus...both very savory! Ordered the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. What sent me over the edge were the desserts! We shared 3 amongst the group: the peanut butter cup, the salted caramel pudding, and the molten chocolate cake. I couldn't decide which one i loved the most!"}
{"text":"We had our 25 person wedding reception here and it was fantastic. The various entrees were well received by all guests, and the desserts were unbelievable. Any time we are attending an event in downtown Phoenix my wife and I make it a point to plan dinner at the Arrogant Butcher"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in LOVE with this place.  The food is exceptional, and I find some of the negative reviews truly fascinating.  As someone who travels to Phoenix often, I make it a point to try and visit at least once every other week.  Both the Seabass and the Short Rib Stew were flavorful and prepared excellently.  If you do not mind spending a bit more for (what I will admit are smaller portions), I think you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials and great staff. Chip, bartender, is the bomb! The appetizer pretzels and provolone are super awesome and the breads are clutch - sweet potato, garlic etc."}
{"text":"Great good that is reasonably priced and a great looking crowd. The various items that are my standards meals are pretzel, and turkey pastrami. Waiters and Waitress are attentive, polite, and do the traditional small talk to see if you're having a great time. I meet here once a month with friends to catch-up. It's just became a tradition for us. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to this place yesterday! I had a WONDERFUl time sitting at the bar . Christain made me the BEST COSMO ever! She was awesome in her service and attitude. I had the opportunity to meet Melissa a manager who was so customer oriented and cared about me having a great experience. My food was very good and I will go back."}
{"text":"What a great place I was so happy with this place specially after eating at the blue hound which disappointed me the service here was top notch and food was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the sweet potato tortelli and strawberry lemonade, which were both tasty. On top of the amazing food, the service was top notch and everyone from the host, server, bartenders and kitchen staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome! Have been there like 4 times already and it's consistently excellent! Service is great as well. Wait staff knows the menu well."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend you try this place if you're in the Phoenix area. I came here with a group of seven for lunch and we tried almost everything on their menu.  Appetizers: house soft pretzels & provolone fondue, zucchini fritters, crispy rock shrimp, pate  Salad: roasted beet salad  Entrees: turkey sloppy Joe, prime rib french dip, jambalaya, sweet potato tortelli, beef short rib stew  Desserts: warm peanut butter cup, blueberry cheesecake, hot chocolate cake, salted caramel pudding  After tasting all the above, the dishes that stood out most were the pretzels, sweet potato tortelli, beef short rib stew, hot chocolate cake and salted caramel pudding. Please do yourself a favor and order ALL of these dishes. Steer clear of the french dip, jambalaya or blueberry cheesecake."}
{"text":"Was a great Restaurant centrally located near all of downtown PHX major facilities; sports arena's, hotels, CBD, courthouse's and sheriffs station etc.  The waiter was really nice and informative. The gumbo was good."}
{"text":"My first review of this spot was really positive but over the years the service has declined. Hostess staff have become rude and leave an air of pretension. Food quality has been good but nothing too impressive. There was a time when you a had one enthusiastic waiter who catered to your specific dining needs but now there's a handful of staff taking and delivering items which just makes you feel like you're being fed by a series of human conveyor belts. There's better options downtown"}
{"text":"Oh. They got me. They got me real good. Simply cannot wait to come back to The Arrogant Butcher.  If I could write a short review it would say:  + Pristine Service + Great Place to Hang Out + Great Drinks + Food hits the spot!  Just go. Get your parking validated! Plan sufficient time!  CUSTOMER SERVICE Buuuut I am a wordy nerd. And I have to give really give props to the customer service here. We showed up on a Thursday for lunch and had the fortune of sitting in Robert G's section. Showing an excitement level I don't think I've seen in a server *ever* he walked us through the delightfully robust menu. My taste buds salivated at the many options. Robert G. got more worked up as I ordered my porter beer. (They stock an excellent porter on draft! Deschutes Black Butte). When someone shows that much passion for their work it rubs off on everyone.   OYSTERS | GET'EM! Based on Robert's elocution and delivery we, of course (!), had to sample some Boston oysters from Cape Cod. Oysters come with many accoutrement options beyond cocktail sauce and horseradish. We were sold on the jalapeño mignonette. It's this green, spicy heavenly goodness. The vinaigrette comes consists of cilantro, cucumber, shallot, jalapeño + red wine vinegar + v.oil.  I'm sighing thinking back to how delightful an experience it was slurping my little raw guys down. I'm from the east coast. This Phoenix locale delivers raw oysters superbly. Had I not already placed a food order I could have contently eaten oysters the rest of the afternoon. (I'll come back and do just that.) GOOD STUFF.  ENTREES | MM MMM! My friend and I ordered at the polar opposites of the palate menu. I went for something spicy (Jamalaya). She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that! Generous servings of sausage, chicken and shrimp are provided.   MISC The bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone. Comfortable for anyone to dine solo. And (!) a number of televisions up high were showing work related content. (I imagine that changes depending on the hour.) I just really liked how unobtrusive they were.  On our way out we noticed there were booths in the interior area of the restaurant. Something to consider checking out. The outdoor patio looks fab!  Love, love, love!  LOVE!"}
{"text":"Our family was trying to get something quick to eat before a game. They had many open tables (not even half full) and they refused to seat us inside. They sat us outside in the blazing weather as one of the people in are party was feeling very nauseous. The food wasn't even that great. Honestly one of my worst eating experiences in awhile."}
{"text":"Great spot. Killer pretzel balls and cheese.  I'd recommend trying to sit at the bar if its busy, because you tend to get really quick service there! I wish they had a bit more of a beer selection, but overall, its a solid spot for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The price is very reasonable and i was amazed that the bus girl took extra precautions when cleaning the tables she was using her phone's flashlight to cleanthe seats and under the tables. I had never seen anything like that in my life.  I ordered a double stscked burger and that was really tasty. I'd recommend this place to everybody"}
{"text":"Pretzel Fondu is a must.  Besides the fact that I keep calling the place, \"The Arrogant Bastard\" instead of Butcher- I just love the name.  I had the fish and chips, which were pretty spectacular, not greasy, but perfectly fried and crisp with a ton of flavor.    The setting is excellent, the ambience is relaxed and plentiful.  Just lots of space and coolness to it.  They have private \"meeting room\" dining areas too that closes off to the rest of the restaurant.  This is something that is needed downtown for the many private lunches that take place.  The bathrooms were really fantastic too- user friendly, I like that about a restroom.  Big flat-screens above the bar area too, which is good for the evening crowd.    I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"yummy food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"In for a quick business lunch on 7/1 before heading to Denver.  Wish I had more time and definitely on my list to return to my next stop through Phoenix (this time for dinner).    Great location in the cleaner/trendier part of downtown.  Great concept and really liked the open kitchen and floorplan.  Place was bustling and the service was crisp and keeping pace.  Just had the iceberg wedge lunch salad which was great - the standard topping (bacon and tomato) plus glazed short rib, chopped egg and avacodo.  Dressing was a very flavorful buttermilk blue cheese.  Nice serving size and everything fresh and tasty.  The lunch menu had plenty of nice options (the beef short rib stew sounded good but 110 degrees doesn't feel like stew weather to me) and everything that passed by us on its way to other tables really looked good.  Small group of 4 and everyone fully enjoyed their lunch.    As mentioned, service was very good and the place was jammed.  Despite the crowd, it was very easy to have a table conversation. Very much looking forward to coming back when I'm not as pressed for time and can enjoy dinner and some of the very good looking cocktails."}
{"text":"I'd give this place six stars if I could.  Filet mignonette, sautéed mushrooms and creamed spinach? I'm in heaven. You must try The Arrogant Butcher. Amazeballs. Seriously the best meal I've had in a very long time. kudos. Love, Lara"}
{"text":"I'm giving the Arrogant butcher 4 coveted stars for 2 reasons: first, its hard to find a decent happy hour downtown with $4 glasses of wine, let alone great wine, and these guys have PurVine as the house special.  Second, as if we were in Paris, they have this delicious mussels appetizer with chunks of sausage and french fries piled on top. Thank whomever the brilliant Frenchman was that thought of this, a true chef d'uvre awaits  The only entree i've had here was less than thrilling, the short-rib stew. It came out piping, skin-off the top of your mouth, hot... When ordering short-rib anything I kind of expect...well...short ribs! Not only was this concoction far from tasty (quite bland, really) there was hardly any short rib to speak of, mostly beans, etc. For some unexplainable reason I've ordered this twice with equal disappointment.  They have some interesting looking daily specials like king crab cioppino on friday that I plan on checking out. I'll let you know.  BOTTOM LINE: See ya there for happy hour"}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with too many restaurants in downtown Phoenix, but I was told over and over to try the Arrogant Butcher.  Our server was phenomenal -- total sweetheart and knew how to read her guests. She was right there before drinks dried up and she kept all the courses coming.  The food was pretty descent. Started off with the pretzels, which are more like pretzel bites. But they bring you a piping hot dish of gooey provolone fondue as a dip.   My entrée didn't come out as ordered, but I didn't want to wait for them to remake it -- it was sweet potato stuffed pasta with chicken. Our other entrée was different than described on the menu. The crab stuffed chicken isn't really \"stuffed.\" It's really just two breaded fillets with crab in between. Both entrees were okay -- nothing spectacular.  Desserts at the Arrogant Butcher are epic. Clearly a lot of creativity goes into designing these sweet treats. The peanut butter cup was my favorite. It's a bowl of warm peanut butter mousse; very airy and light. They add a dollop of chocolate gelato in the center and then serve freshly baked peanut butter cookies on the side. Not at all what I expected, although I was pleasantly surprised. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  First time going here.  The food was top notch.  The staff was super friendly.  I was having a lunch with coworkers, having a serious discussion about the future of the company.  We were making great progress, then Hank walked in.  The first thing he did was call out the butcher.  \"Who's the arrogant jerk!\"  He yelled.  Then he started making inappropriate comments to the male wait staff.  He insisted on having a drink, and when they wouldn't serve him, he lost it.  He pulled a bottle of 151 out of his pocket, slammed it, and smashed the empty bottle on the floor.  Thank goodness he passed out on the floor.  The manager and one other guy, rolled Hank out the door and left him on the sidewalk.  I recommend The Arrogant Butcher.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Wow Don't know what to say but just WOW, the food and appetizers we ordered were simply some of the best tasting food I have had. The crispy shrimp appetizer and the artichoke hummus was out of this world. we stopped by in the afternoon before a  ball game, we found a spot at the bar. the staff was very friendly and I would highly recommend the Arrogant Butcher it's really good food and great service"}
{"text":"My family and I came into The Arrogant Butcher for my mother's birthday...needless to say we were all very disappointed with the whole experience. We were hoping to be in and out easily with a great lunch, as we've eaten at Culinary Dropout and it has always been good, and we've been here for dinner in the past...we waited thirty minutes for a waiter to order our food, and we'd hoped that even though we had to wait for that it would be downhill from there...unfortunately, it took an entire hour to get our meals, which consisted of simple sandwiches and salads...when the salads did come they didn't even have the right dressing. The drinks were empty most of the time as well. The manager was quite rude when we asked for her, and the waiter never did apologize...the manager also was quick to blame the waiter for the error, which seemed very unprofessional in my opinion. In addition, the cost of the food seemed to FAR exceed the quality...the fact that you can get artisan bread for the cheeses but then a BLT comes on a bun seems a bit silly. Overall, the experience was very lax and not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The Arrogant Butcher suffers from an identity problem.  It wasn't arrogant, and the seafood dominated menu is certainly not something you'd see from a butcher.  Even the marketing material promoting the place indicated it had some sort of sassy attitude, so I kind of expecting waiters doing a schtick or something, but disappointingly, they were pleasent, adequate waiters :(  Not having been to this restaurant before, I didn't know what to expect.  The interior is like a strange mash of sports bar and tacky bistro - only further confusing the identity of the establishment.    I'm typically a big fan of seafood, and the fish and chips were decent, but I was expecting a long list of butcher type items on the menu, not oyster shooters, and 3 types of fish.  Especially in downtown, middle of the freakin desert, Phoenix.    I'd suggest this place for a beer and an appetizer while sitting at the bar, not so much for a sit down dinner date."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at the Arrogant Butcher with a bunch of people I met. We waited 45 minutes for the food to arrive, which pissed us off. I had a delicious, albeit lukewarm, sweet potato pasta with spinach, parmesan, mushrooms, and roasted hazelnuts in a cream sauce. Dessert was a \"warm\" peanut butter cup which turned out to be a big bowl of peanut butter soup with chocolate ice cream and 2 giant peanut butter cookies. Wow it was just too much. If this dessert was just a third of its size it would've been a passable item."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Arrogant butcher for a long time and finally ended up going a couple weeks ago after the Tequila Fest with the BF and Erin B. and her BF. I wasn't super hungry after the festival, but still wanted to get an appetizer or something to fill up for dinner. We were seated quickly and the service was good. My main issue with this place is their selection of appetizers. It isn't very broad and there wasn't anything I really wanted to order.... I wish they had a little more variety in their apps. So I ended up ordering a main to share. I got the short rib stew dish. It was good, it was spicy and savory. The cornbread that came with it was just ok. I also tried our friends meals, both the tortelloni (which was a little too sweet and small for the price) and the pretzels with cheese fondue (pretty good stuff). My other issue with this place is that I think it is just a touch too expensive for what you get. The food didn't amaze me, which I expect when I order essentially a bowl of soup for 15-16$. Anyway, I would give it another shot, but it isn't on the top of my list for places to return to.   PS while we were there we saw 2 famous people eating there...so that may be some of the appeal (Xhibit and a football player from the Cardinals)."}
{"text":"Was superbly impressed with The Arrogant Butcher!  We ordered Prosciutto ($10), Goat Brie ($5),The Sweet Potato Tortellini with Mushrooms & Hazelnuts ($12), and the Chicken Stroganoff ($16).   The Sweet Potato Tortellini blew my mind! It was super buttery but fluffy and full of flavor. I really loved that they made the pastas here (including the Chicken Stroganoff) in-house. Everything tasted amazing and was priced reasonably for the hearty portions.  The actual interior of the restaurant felt more casual than anticipated but that's fine and probably more appropriate given the location (next to the stadium and lots of people/foot traffic from that). They have a spacious dining room, outside seating (covered), as well as plenty of seating surrounding the bar in the front-center of the restaurant.  Overall a solid spot and I hope to return on my next trip to Phoenix! I'm still thinking about those Tortellini!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to take part in Arrogant Butcher's preview lunch and I was totally impressed with the restaurant's design and the staff's performance.   The service in particular was nothing short of spectacular, especially considering the size of the event and the Downtown notables in attendance (Mayor Gordon, City higher-ups, media).   I love the Butcher's view of US Airways Center and Chase Field and its vantage point will only improve if the city can just find a way to utilize that awful parking lot across from the basketball arena. With business reemerging in the warehouse district and baseball season fast approaching, things are definitely looking up for those blocks of Downtown.  Anyway, back to the Butcher. The entrees were well-received. I found my pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread to be way too salty, but I figure I made my own bed ordering cured meat on a pretzel. The crab cake salad, stew, jambalaya, roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts (cheesecake and chocolate cake cups) were delicious.  The bar is a huge square with heavy stone counters, plenty of seating and flatscreens, insuring that the Butcher will be a popular happy hour and pregame destination. There's also a wraparound patio.  Prices seemed friendly, too. I'm not a Fox RC devotee but could see myself becoming a regular at Arrogant Butcher."}
{"text":"We began our meal with Oysters and crispy prosciutto deviled eggs. Oysters were so fresh and tasty. Deviled eggs were very good and flavorful. I could definitely eat a dozen of those. Husband had a NYstrip with Yukon gold mashed potatoes. His words, \"steak was incredible.\"  The scallops were tender and flavorful. They were on creamed corn. Wow, the creamed corn was the best I ever had   It was definitely a meal to remember. Finishing off our celebration with salted Carmel pudding.  Finding my vocabulary too limited to describe the pudding. Definitely need to finish any meal here with pudding.  Compliments to the Chef. Waiter was friendly and attentive.   Great place to celebrate or anytime to enjoy a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my boyfriend and I by the concierge at the hotel we were staying at. We came here at about 8:00 pm on Saturday night for drinks and appetizers so the wait for a table for two was about 45 minutes.. but it was worth it! The atmosphere is awesome and the food was really yummy. We will definitely be coming back the next time we go to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is always good, Servers are usually attentive however the manners of the host staff need some serious work. Its unfortunate because that is the first impression of how your meal is going to progress and several times I have just wanted to walk out after being seated."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch while attending a class in downtown phoenix, on the recommendation of their \"great jumbalaya\".  skipped the recommendation, and got a cubano sandwhich and a side salad.  meal was quick and good, although the $13 price tag was a little high IMO.  the crowd was 100% corporate businessman power lunch.  atmosphere was good, and the bar tenders  - while friendly and attentive enought, had the type of corporate  personalities i expected.  i felt like i was on vacation, and the restaurant was more of a chain than a neighborhood establishment, but i'll definitely give it another try sometime - when I find myself in downtown phoenix, and feeling a little too heavy in the wallet."}
{"text":"I've been here before and wasn't very impressed but decided for restaurant week would be a nice opportunity to try out some more of the menu and get a better experience.  Used OpenTable and was able to secure a late dinner for 9pm Saturday night- the hostess and waitress were nice and we were seated with drinks fairly quickly. The menu looked good and I ordered the smoked salmon toast, crab-stuffed chicken and we ordered one of each of the desserts which were blueberry cheesecake and a salted caramel mousse thing.   Waited about 20 mins for the app, but it was fairly busy so no issue there- the salmon toast was not overly smoked, very tasty and the only part of the meal I liked. When the entree came I was kinda taken aback by what was an actual menu item- they serve two crusted and fried chicken breasts with a cold crab cake in the middle. There was a thick lemon caper sauce on the top breaded chicken breast but not enough to overcome the dry fried mess of a plate. The chicken was pounded thin and the breading was easily double the amount of chicken. The crab was decently seasoned but overpowered. I barely ate any of it.   Desserts were both overly sweet and unbalanced. So disappointed. I'm glad we didn't pay menu prices for this because I can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place, so we finally checked it out for dinner - very disappointed. My Sweet Potato Tortelli was very good, but my husband got the greasiest fish & chips I've ever seen. For the price, those are not good odds. Odd thing: my husband saw my same entre at another table and said they got a much bigger portion, so now I'm PO'd.  It's very noisy, too, so we won't be going back in search of a quiet dinner here. I would try it for lunch - if somebody else was paying."}
{"text":"Went to the Arrogant Butcher tonight with some coworkers while visiting from out of town. They were pretty busy for a Thursday night, and the service was ok. Food was pretty good, everybody in our party seemed to be happy with their meals. But the prices were pretty expensive for the quality of food.  Not a bad experience at all, but I most likely wouldn't become a regular here."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a convention, we found a site per yummy antipasto appetizer followed by delicious salmon with oyster mushrooms, tiny baby potatoes, green beans and tiny pearl onions. Very fresh and just the right amount of food! Our waiter Adam was fabulous. Lucky find!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time and was very impressed! Great Happy Hour and highly recommend the sausage with spaghetti in the spicy tomato sauce. IPA was awesome and service was fantastic. Thank you Gino who stopped by and asked how things tasted. , \"Forget about it!\"  And Eric was a great server. Thanks and we will be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I was in town visiting friends who live downtown and two nights in a row we went here for happy hour. I tried two happy hour drinks, The Mule and The Maid,  both were excellent. Happy hours prices seem decent to me.  The only food we had was appetizers but the pretzel fondue is amazing. It is so good that we ordered it both nights. Bread and oil is good and so is the chicken pate.  The real shining star of this restaurant has to be the service. We had several different people at our tables both nights and they were all super nice. The server from our first night even remembered us and came up to our table on the second night to talk to us.  I swear I don't work here (I live in Vegas) but I felt compelled to review after reading some negative reviews. Come for happy hour before a game, but come early The Arrogant Butcher is popular and the bar fills up."}
{"text":"I only went here for an appetizer and a couple of cocktails before seeing a Phoenix Suns game at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The drinks were potent - had a Moscow Mule and it was made well. Staff was friendly, service was prompt. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I really don't get what people like about this place, besides the vibe. The drinks were fine, nothing out of this world even though they were labeled as their specialty cocktails. We got the chef's board and it's a total ripoff. They fill it up with all the additional sides you can add to a regular board and barely give you any cheese. We also split the BBQ chicken and it was so bad. It was literally just chicken with marinara sauce on top. It had no BBQ flavor anywhere."}
{"text":"Came in without reservations on Valentine's night, after our original plans fell through.  Suuuper busy, but staff didn't let that get in the way of their service.  I was expecting exasperated looks from the hostesses when we said we didn't have reservations, but we were warmly greeted and encouraged to stick around for bar seating.  We surprisingly didn't have to wait too long for a couple seats to open up and man, those bartenders never had a dull moment.  They still were all very friendly, very attentive, and somehow managed to keep their sense of humor while running around.  Great first experience and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Been here three times... all three because we were in the area and thought we'd get a drink.  Third time's not a charm... arrogant is the perfect name.  Beyond the pretzel bread and cheese dip, which is amazing, there is no reason to go here.  Each time we've been, they are SLLLOOOOOWWWW and not very friendly.  Last night, went to get a drink rather than sit in our car in the parking lot after the theater... they acted like they were doing us a favor having us there.  Overpriced drinks... no later night food- kitchen closes at 10.  The bartender had no personality and basically just wanted us to leave... so we did after we had to ask for our tab.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Lunchtime perfection! Walked there from my hotel & enjoyed a Santan shandy on the patio while waiting for succulent oysters, the beet salad (I swear there was no dressing & it was still amazing ) and brie with crusty bread & jam. Heaven."}
{"text":"Called to ask for a reservation and was told to come over that it would be a 15 min wait. Walked over right away(took 10 minutes) and was told the wait was actually one and a half hours and that it had been for an hour! The hostess who had answered the phone had lied. Lousy way to try to get business."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant on 9/15 and enjoyed the food and the service so much that I went back again on the night of 9/16 for some more. The waitstaff are very friendly and are always checking in on you to see how you are doing. The second night there I opted for one of their desserts, It was a caramel pudding, which was absolutely delicious. I was expecting it to be the sticky consistency of caramel but it was smooth like pudding. I was then told that because I ate there the previous night that they comped my dessert which was awesome. High marks for the staff and management!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once and really enjoyed this place.  I shared the baby back ribs and rib stew with my friends.  We were all moaning anf groaning from the savory goodness.  This is really awesome comfort food.  Also, they have some of my favorite wines on their list.  Just what I need after a long day!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place is HUGE should have tipped me off. Too large to be able to offer truly good quality food. But since it is a Fox restaurant, I thought it would probably be a good experience nonetheless.   The food is not good, not bad. I think the food can be pretty much summed up with \"it tastes like Applebee's.\" We had bolognese and ribs.  My bolognese could have easily been remade at home with a jar of Ragu. The ribs, not counting the sauce, were pretty good. They were definitely very meaty and hearty. I wasn't too crazy about the sauce as it tasted too much like honey.  Like Applebee's (or Chili's, take your pick), the menu is generic and the food is just okay. The prices are not bad but a little steep for what you get.   I don't understand the popularity of this place. I'd trade the fancy interiors at the Arrogant Butcher for a hole-in-the-wall with good food any day."}
{"text":"Provably the best place in town. Best Ambiance Best Cuisine  Best Service Cleanliness: 10"}
{"text":"Great pretzels.  Good turkey sloppy joe.  Definitely sloppy, but tasty.  I tried my boyfriend's pastrami on a pretzel bun. OMG...that pretzel bun was to die for.  So good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Great atmosphere. The made from scratch offerings are delectable. Service was spot on. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it!"}
{"text":"It's one of those places you should bring a group of 4 to.  I gotta tell ya.  You'll order something here, and you look at anyone else's plate and you really want to try there's.  It's one of those Fox restaurant concepts that is right next to the Talking Stick Resort Arena.  It's a great place to go before heading to the Suns game."}
{"text":"We went there twice on a 5 day trip to Phoenix. Loved it so much the first time we wanted to go back two days later. We are really big fans of True Food Kitchen, a sister restaurant and we were not disappointed - even with the highest of expectations. We had the Kale Salad, Rock Shrimp Pasta, Pretzel Bread Fondu, Sweet Potato Tortelli, the Seabass and the Peanut Butter Cup for dessert.  (Remember, we were there twice!). The food was soooo incredible. I don't think I could choose a favorite. They are all that good.   They have a great bar with a well stocked selection of beers, wines and liquor (at least I noticed my favorite; Maker's Mark).   The service is just as good. We sat down right at our reserved time (on a Saturday night) and were greeted by the most personable waitress. Cute, bubbly, friendly and knowledgable. She took our drink order and told us our waiter would be with us right away (which he was). A little disappointed that she (Melissa) wasn't going to be serving us, but our waiter was great.   A bit later, Peter, the GM, came up and thanked us for coming in and wanted our feedback. Actually said my wife's name and our last name. Really made us feel like welcomed regulars.   The only problem we have with the Arrogant Butcher is that we don't have one in Southern California.  I hope that changes soon."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great menu.  This is definitely a place for CARNIVORS!  From the mixed meats and cheeses to the awesome meatloaf.  Don't forget the pretzels and fondue.  This place has a great menu and bar selection.  I loved it.  No for the bad part, a couple in our party of 8 ordered scallops.  Six of our dinners came out in a timely fashion.  We politely waited for the pair of Scallop orders.  Food was getting cold so others started in.  After 15 minutes, we tracked down someone in the open kitchen only to find that they ran out of scallops.  No one bothered to tell my colleagues.  This was rather unacceptable and lead to my less than 5 star rating.  The ultimately ordered salads as an altternate.  It would have been only three stars, but they did ultimately recognize the issue and thee manager was ultimately quite apologetic. Hence the recovery on an additional star.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a business trip. The filet was amazing. Tons of flavor. The waiter was very polite and helpful. The hostess was very personable and played along while my coworker was playing a joke. The oysters are really good. They have a  jalapeño sauce, it is amazing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was great. My buddy and I shared the chefs pick of meats and cheeses. This was a good choice and delicious. The drink selection is solid and the prices aren't bad. I would make a reservation, it can get crowded."}
{"text":"We met friends here for a \"Beer & Banter\" dinner (1 dinner of a 3 series of 5 course set menu meals paired with different breweries). The entire experience was amazing.   The food was wonderful, portions were just the right amount, and we enjoyed both hearing the Lumberyard Brewery owners and rep speak about the different beers and also hearing the Sous Chef and his assistant speak about the food and pairings (Fox RC definitely hires chefs who can speak to large crowds, not all chefs, from my experience, are capable of such). The chefs were excited to be able to \"go off menu\" for the pairings and were excited to share their thought process.   Jaime seemed to be the manager in charge of the event and he made the whole experience very fun, laid back & welcoming. This was the third dinner of their summer series (we missed the other two unfortunately) but I am excited to see what other events AB comes up with in the future - I'll be there. I am also looking forward to visiting the restaurant to experience their normal dining menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this Sam Fox restaurant with friends before Dbacks game. Good location right next to USAirways and Chase Field. Arrived at 4:30 on a Friday night, place was already getting busy but we luckily got an inside table. Food is good here, we had all of the appetizer choices and they were excellent. The pretzel fondue is the common thread with all of his restaurants. We love The Yard in north central Phoenix but would definitely return to the Butcher while in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We ordered the shrimp appetizer and got the pretzels on a kitchen error as well. Both were incredible!  Dinner was the burger and beet salad for us. Pro tip: get the burger with bacon, avocado, and a friend egg. Extremely satisfying and filling.  Drinks and food came out quick and the service was great. Anthony checked in with us just the right amount and was quick to get us what we needed.  A great place to stop when downtown - close to the stadiums if going to a game or concert."}
{"text":"Always have to sit at the bar. And the general man working at lunch was great! Food took a tad but long but the environment made up for any hiccups that may have occurred."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so loud inside that one cannot reasonably speak to their dinner companion over the plastic topped booth tables.  The open kitchen adds to the chaos.  We had the sea bass and crabbed stuffed chicken.  Both were dried out and over cooked--possibly pre cooked and put on a warming table.  When I spend $100-150 to go out for dinner, I expect a good ambience, great food, and a full menu.  Except for the service, this restaurant had none of the above.  We suggest other restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places downtown Phx and never disappoints! Love everything on their menu and they have a great atmosphere and staff as well. Today I had the seared salmon chopped salad for a change and it was amazing!! Great place to stop in before games and after!"}
{"text":"I love the atmoshpere in here! We came in right before the Suns game Friday night. Staff was super cool and attentive and the food was delicious. Def a great downtown restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! My daughter and I had dinner on a Thursday night, and it was hopping! I loved the atmosphere and music was just the right level of loud.  Our server, Danielle, was amazing!! She was very attentive and took great care of us. The starters were very interesting. We had a hard time choosing, but decided on the goat brie with cherry marmalade and rustic bread-delicious!! Then we tried the homemade hummus with artichokes, olives and cherry tomatoes-all served with warm pita bread. Such delicate flavors for what I thought was a pretty ordinary dish. The entree was sweet potato tortellini with mushrooms, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts in a light butter cream sauce. It was one of the most unique and delicious meals I've had in a long time.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a excellent lunch here today. I ordered the shortrib stew and it was wonderful. My gf ordered a bowl of potato soup and a cheese/bread combo, she was pleased also."}
{"text":"If my Butcher was this good, I'd be Arrogant too! Great atmosphere, perfectly located for a night at the Symphony or a game at Talking Stick. The staff, awesome...the food, WOW! It wasn't badly priced for the types of food and quality you were served. Its a great venue for a full meal or just a couple appetizers over a business meeting. I will be visiting again to try the next thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for pre game night or concert. Happy hour is nice selection of drinks and food always friendly service"}
{"text":"Went there on 11/10, had the hummus appetizer, it was really good!! Then we ordered the Pretzel bread and cheese fondue, OMG is was the bomb!! Service was excellent! I had Fish and Chips, it was good but a bit salty! My friend Sweet Potato Tortelli, she said it was awesome! Next time we go to an event downtown, we will go back."}
{"text":"Arrogant Butcher continues to disappoint.  I came here on Friday to celebrate someone's birthday.  The pretzel/fondue appetizer was awesome, as always, but I'm beginning to suspect that it's the only good thing on the menu -- and really, that's not very impressive because how could they possibly mess up salted bread and melted cheese??  We were headed to the art museum after dinner, so I decided to order an appetizer for my meal since I knew I couldn't finish a whole entree and I didn't want to lug leftovers around with me on the lightrail.  At first I ordered the steamed mussels, but sadly they were out of them for the night.  My second choice was the salmon rillette, which the menu described as \"smoked salmon with crusty bread.\"  I was expecting a lox and french bread type of plate, but what came out was smoked salmon that had been mushed up into little chunks, soaked in some sort of liquid (tasted like vinegar maybe?), poured in a jar and topped with many capers.  I gave it a try and spread it on the bread, but after 2 bites I knew I did not like it.  it was mushy and sour and yecchh.  I was waiting for the bartender (we sat at the bar) to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food so that I could exchange my salmon for a salad or something, but she never did.  she only came at the end of our meal and collected my plate (still FULL of food except for the 2 bites missing) and threw all the food in the trash.  you would think the plate full of uneaten food would've clued her in that I didn't enjoy my meal, but either she didn't notice or didn't care, but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment.  I didn't want to be fussy, so we paid and left.  My dining companion ordered the jambalaya for his meal and said it was really greasy.  Arrogant Butcher, you make me angry that you charge so much money for bleh food.  I will not be convinced to come here again, no matter how good your pretzel/fondue is!"}
{"text":"Heard it was a great place by an elite member, so we went in but the wait was too long. Seems like a pretty popular place.aybe next time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great drinks. Food though kind of not impressed. Got the New Zealand Sea Bass and it was pretty subpar for the price. My friend got the steak and wasn't that impressed. Personally would rather go for drinks and small plates with a group of friends."}
{"text":"We're a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there's about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn't seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107°. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn't accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn't know how long it'd be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we'd just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the \"reserved\" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he'd rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn't engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn't even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn't received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, \"oh, you want more?\" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that's a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn't get the attention of the server and he didn't come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don't leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn't be back, individually or as a whole.  I've been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won't be back after yesterday's experience.  UPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven't heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn't change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it."}
{"text":"We had lunch on National Oyster Day, where they had a great deal of $1 oysters. They were fresh and served with a variety of delectable sauces.   If you have a sweet tooth, you definitely need to save room for the peanut butter cup. It's light bs just the right amount to finish off a good meal.   Service was fast and attentive even during lunch rush hour"}
{"text":"The nachos are the best! The bar is nice to sit at for a drink & apps or (when it's nice) the outdoor patio is fun."}
{"text":"One of the better places for a pre-Sun's game dinner but the hostess sat us practically in the kitchen even with reservations. Drinks good, seafood previously frozen but burger good. They could do better given the pedigree."}
{"text":"Misleading menu. We ordered a salad that says it has watermelon in it. Once I looked closer at the description it said watermelon radish. Not what I wanted at all. I even mentioned to the person taking the order how excited I was to order a salad with watermelon in it. I won't come back. The salad was 11.50 and was mostly lettuce with a few scattered beets and a tiny smear of goat cheese."}
{"text":"This is a good bar to have a few drinks and start your night. We had a few craft beers and the wings. The sauce was spicy but not over the top. The staff was really nice. The beer selection was good. 4 or 5 beers on top and a local selection both on tap and in bottle. Our orders came out fast and we had fun. No issues here. Def would come back. This would be a good place to go before a baseball game to get started!"}
{"text":"Located in the center. There is parking lot near the restaurant. Personally I like the chicken and shrimp. You could also try beef soup there which looks delicious to me."}
{"text":"Good, solid food.  Not great food, just good.  I went here for lunch with a friend.  We sat at the chef's bar, which overlooks the kitchen, which was nice because the chef gave us a little sampling of the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh Salad, which was pretty good.  I ordered the chicken and corn chowder to start, which was delicious!  For my meal, I had the chopped salmon salad, which was good also.    Like I said, the food was good, but not great.  I'd like to try out this place for happy hour so I can try some more items."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Thursday and was seated right away. Parking was close using the garage. The menu is succint but creative. We had the pretzels with fondue and they were delicious! I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. Honestly, one of the best salads I have ever had anywhere. My friend ordered the prime rib sandwich. Everything was good and the service was pretty good. They had a lot of staff which is nice to see instead of having too little in a busy place like downtown. I like the idea of the restaurant and decided this would be a nice place for a pre-show wine and cheese snack! Overall, very nice place and very unique. Good for friends, not so much a date."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check out the latest lunch/dinner place downtown.  The atmosphere is awesome and I love the outdoor seating- A+.  The food was A-ok (B-/C+).  We came during lunch and I had the turkey sloppy joe with a roasted poblano pepper.  The pepper was a nice touch of kick to the sandwich but the sloppy joe meat itself was just okay.  My husband had the Bolegnese, which he said the sauce was really good.  My kids had the fish & chips plus the chicken strips.  Unfortunately the chicken strips were placed in the same beer batter as the fish and fried.  My normally adventurous - eat anything 6 year old took one bite and said \"yuck\".  I will give the restaurant another try and hope that 2nd try gives me food that is a \"wow.\""}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. I was really expecting to be wow'd by everything since we've been to other restaurants that are a part of this chain. I paid $12 for two small wedges of cheese. We got the butcher board as well. I almost chipped my tooth on an olive seed that got mixed in with the pistachios. No bueno. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I really like the Arrogant Butcher. I have never had rude service and the food is always great.  It is kinda the new happening lunch spot Downtown, so it can get crazy around noon. Know this and make a reservation!  Happy hour is fun. Great specials. Love the pretzels & fondue. Get it, you won't regret it.  The salmon salad is possibly the best salad I ever had."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu was not very thrilling...the $3 beers that we ordered both tasted like Keystone Lights poured in mugs. The AB cheeseburger, however, was worth it. I would recommend it if you're in the mood for a good burger. It also came with fries which had the perfect level of crunch.   Parking is convenient both on the street and in the nearby structure for which validation is provided."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and the food was great!!  I would highly recommend - was very busy and even without a reservation we got a table quickly!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I have been wanting to check this place out since it opened and finally got an opportunity last night. We just had a baby girl six weeks ago & This was our first date night out so we were looking forward to a good experience. I made reservations for 4 people and we arrived at 6:45, the place wasn't really busy yet. The hostess was friendly and sat us right away. Our server was great as well, very knowledgeable and offered her suggestions since we were all new to the menu. To drink I had the Skinny Raspberry Mojito, it was blander than I expected so I opted out of a second one and ordered a Kiltlifter. My girlfriend had \"The Pink Drink\" which she raved about! For an appetizer we ordered the pretzel fondue which was perfectly delicious, the pretzels were soft & light! Each of us loved our main dish (which came out quicker than we expected), I ordered the short rib stew which had the perfect amount of spice and was served with a corn bread muffin which was to die for! Overall- great service, friendly staff, delicious menu items, & a really cool ambiance! We had a great experience here and love to explore Downtown Phoenix whenever we get the opportunity so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I arrived in Arizona. I asked the front desk at the hotel what the best restaurant in town was. Without question they said the Arrogant Butcher. To put it kindly, this restaurant has fantastic decor, but is an upgraded version of Applebee's. The filet was pathetic, the pasta was overcooked and the service was about as good as visiting an Applebee's or worse. I feel bad for the residents, who seem to think this is high class food. Good luck to you all..."}
{"text":"I came here today for a post-work function with 9 of my coworkers and we have never had more amazing service. Our server, Alex, blew us all away. He went above and beyond the call of duty and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Arizona. I am in town on business for one night only and I'm glad I spent my evening having dinner here.   Thank you for your amazing service, Alex."}
{"text":"Had a business event here and since we were in town for the day, we decided to sneak in and have lunch first. The staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful. They did a great job of being there when you need them but not being intrusive.  Anytime I go to a new place that purports to be Steak-centric I always order a burger, because if you screw it up, there's no way I'm going to trust you to fix me a steak.  Everything is made scratch and I ordered a Cheeseburger and fries. It was one of the better burgers I've ever had. A good sized portion, without being obscene like a lot of placed that think they need to server you a half pound of meat. Bun, condiments, fries...all perfect.   Do yourself a favor and order some of their Passion Fruit iced tea, it's wonderful.  Later in the day, we had our business event in one of the back rooms and the experience was still fantastic. The staff took great care of us and the charcuterie, the pretzels and cheddar fondue, and the desserts were all fantastic.  Highly recommend if you're in the downtown area and need a good meal or for a small business event."}
{"text":"Ok, this place was pretty good. The cubano I had was pretty good, the fries were good, and my wife's BLT was pretty good. Given that, this place is too \"trendy\" for my tastes. Everyone dining in here looked like they were all rich hedge fund managers."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times and had great service and delicious food.  I think most restaurants struggle in the first month.  I would recommend the Arrogant Butcher to anyone headed Downtown for dinner.  The pretzels with fondue are my fave.  The cheeseburger is great, too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Service was fantastic! I ordered the sweet potato tortellini and was not disappointed! Great drink selection as well. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"They say restaurants & their names are the images of their owner--just sayin'...ps food not bad"}
{"text":"Awesome place for food and drinks. Menu had lots of options that I liked. Started off with a meat and cheese board and added a few extra options. Got the stew as my main course and it was delicious. Will definitely come back again.  Only negative thing I would say is there was a 35 minute wait, with about 15 open tables outside open but \"Reserved\". A few tables were occupied in the 2 hour window we were there. Quicker table turnover means hungry customers get to eat and drink quicker."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Second time here. The menu has a varied selection- meat, pasta, seafood, veggie.... and everything was delicious. I ordered the sweet potato tortelli: TO DIE FOR. So good that I feared it might be a seasonal dish and I would not be able to get it all the time (but the server reassured me it is not :) My friend had the crab stuffed chicken, also incredible. We shared the zucchini fritters and a small charcuterie board for apps and I was given a complimentary dessert for my bday (bluberry cheesecake).   While the food was sooo delightful in itself, I also can't overlook the service there. I had made a reservation, and every interaction with staff was so positive. I would highly recommend Arrogant Butcher to anyone who hasn't been! I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Very nice. Love the patio section - nice view of downtown. Servers are super nice and helpful, too.  Happy hour (3 PM - 6 PM) has some great prices for cocktails, beer, and wine. Pretzels with fondue are so delicious - soft, chewy, salty! Crispy shrimp are awesome. The portion size is good for the price and the aioli takes the shrimp over the top.  Tried some of the chacuterie meats, which were also great. Love the crusty bread they're served with. Will definitely be back for more good eats and drinks!"}
{"text":"We were told the wait was up to 30 minutes agreed and went to the bar, just as our drinks hit the bar top (5 min) we were called to our table. Apps and salad were good oysters, zucchini and deviled eggs. She had chicken stroganoff he had short rib stew. Her meal had three mushrooms was decent but nothing to write home about. His meal tasted like it was poured from a Campbell's chunky can very salty and meat was very uniform like it was processed. We sat with one having the back to the bar very crowded and loud, beer was good. I'd save your money and go elsewhere we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Great place with great food.  Make certain to get a reservation.  It looks like a funky diner but the food is next level good.  The portions are a little small for the price but taste great.  Wine list could use some improvement or it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Spot on.  Not only was the food excellent it was properly cooked.  I had the jambalaya and the shrimp wasn't tough and the okra wasn't slimy."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Sea bass was delishes and the butchers platter was to die for! Ambiance and service was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a meat and cheese lovers paradise!! Wonderful food and good atmosphere. Staff is very friendly! Service time was fair. I recommend this venue!"}
{"text":"I had the house Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue as an appetizer.  It was yummy, but it's pretty big and between two people, it is easy to fill up on and spoil your actual meal.  That being said, the meals were huge!!  I ordered their Sloppy Joe, which was recommended by our waitress.  She said it was out of this world.  Well, it was just alright.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but definitely not worth ordering again if I ever came back.  My man ordered a cheeseburger, which he enjoyed.    We were first seated at a two seater booth, but we wanted to sit next to each other.  When we asked if we could move, the hostess looked confused and perplexed.  She eventually moved us, but she reacted like it was a huge deal (more like nervousness).  The restaurant was empty, and she sat us in an area where there was a server.  I am not sure what the issues was.  She was sweet about it though. Maybe she was new??   Our waitress was also somewhat spotty, and our drinks ran dry for quite sometime before she ever appeared again.  We didn't even order anything crazy.  I had a water and my man had a lemonade!   I wish I could blame it on our waitress being busy, but the restaurant was still dead.  So, not sure were she ran off to, and when we tried to spot another waiter/ress down, they too were hard to find.  Overall the food was good, but the waiting was ok.  I wouldn't come here again unless nothing else was open.  I am not even from Phoenix and I can tell you that there are too many better options to choose from in downtown."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door by two lovely ladies. The place was not busy yet they said that it would be a 45 min wait to be seated out side  So we took the first available  15 minutes later after I spoke to the bartender and asked him why the wait for a table outside was 45 minutes yet no one is here. We were seated   Food options seemed interesting but NOT for the price Atmosphere is great  If u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a Tilted Kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner    If u are a very wealthy person (your salary is more then 100,000 by yourself) u will be able to afford eating and drinking here"}
{"text":"It's okay. Nobody seems especially happy to be there.  The food is okay and the atmosphere is busy. I liked the oysters."}
{"text":"My husband and I went the Arrogant Butcher before the stevie Nicks Concert and the restaurant was packed with a two hour wait. There were a few seats at the bar near the kitchen but we decided to wait and come back after the concert. Fortuntely , we left the concert a little early and was able to score a patio seat. We ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe and side Tabbouleh salad to share. I almost which i had mine own because both where so good. The sloppy joe was so yummy it inspired me to make my own at home. I cant wait to go back and try other items on the menu. To Be Continued ..."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere, but terrible service from the host staff.   We had a reservation for 12:15, made months in advance. We arrived at 12:05 and the restaurant was almost completely empty. A HUGE crowd from the convention center arrived around the same time. Some of the convention folks had reservations for 12:00 and were promptly seated - totally fine. We (toward the front of the crowd) were told to wait until closer to our reservation, which was okay, since we were a few minutes early.   As we sat off to the side, the host staff seated multiple large parties without reservations and the restaurant quickly became very full. Around 12:13, after the crowd died down, a member of our group asked if we could be seated yet. The hostess rudely told her we needed to continue waiting until closer to our reservation time, to ensure that we enjoyed good service. Right before 12:15, the same woman walked over to seat our party, acting completely unaware that we were confused and unhappy. Our table had obviously been sitting empty the entire time we waited in the entrance. After ordering, we got to sit around and watch everyone else in the restaurant get their food before us, even though we had arrived first, with a reservation.   Maybe I don't understand how restaurant seating works, but from a customer's point of view, it is very annoying to see multiple large parties without reservations be seated before your reservation will be accepted (and you're less than 10 minutes early). To us, it felt like the host staff was purposefully making us wait, to spite us. If that was not the case, they could have kindly explained their protocol.   These interactions definitely soured our experience. The food tasted fine, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The service was excellent and the food was quite good.  I had the scallops over corn puree with mushrooms and pancetta (I think it was pancetta) and it was so yummy I've been trying to reproduce it at home.  My friend had the meatloaf and loved it.  Nice mix of comfort food and more modern cuisine here.  Drinks were good too."}
{"text":"I came here a while back, the food was good and the service was great. I cannot remember my waitresses name but she was awesome she checked on us a few times and she was also very funny. I would recommend this place to anyone!   The service is what made me give the five stars because now days it's had to find places with good service."}
{"text":"We arrived at the arrogant butcher and looked around he restaurant in wonder. The restaurant was beautiful. Our server, Matt, came over to our table within two minutes, and while he didn't interrupt us catching up with each other, he made us feel welcome and told us to take our time. It had been a while since our party of six had seen each other and we wanted to catch up. Matt quickly took our drink order and returned with our order faster than should have been possible. We asked for a little time to finish catching up and Matt willingly obliged, without ignoring us. A few minutes later, Matt came back and offered us appetizers. We decided on the butcher platter and we weren't disappointed. It was everything our server promised and we couldn't wait for Matt to suggest a few entrees. After much talk and consultation with Matt, we ordered the NY strip, the jambalaya, and the crab stuffed chicken among other things. Matt couldn't have been more right. Everything was amazing. Our friends said if any of their friends come to Arizona that they will recommend any fox restaurants to all of their friends. Honestly... 10/10. And it's hard to impress us."}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix for a few nights and aren't really sure or convinced if there's great food to be had around here, go to this place. You are likely to come away pleased. I was.   Great location - in downtown, right by the fancy shmancy US Airways Center, and a great looking place at that. Recommend getting the beef stew, it's quite special. And the heavy corn bread it comes with it is quite delicious too. My colleagues ordered the filet and the NY strip - and both were apparently good."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great! Fantastic lights hanging from the ceiling. I had the beet salad and it was perfect. My daughter had the Chinese chicken salad. Both were dressed perfectly. Not too much or too little-usually I ask for the dressing on the side so it's not over dressed but forgot to here. No worries it was perfect! Service was great also!"}
{"text":"While the most of the reviews of this place are stellar, I was a bit disappointed with my visit here.  The place has an interesting atmosphere. The restaurant is like an upscale diner with a trendy bar area.  I was here with a group from a conference I was attending here. We had a 45 minute wait when we arrived at 8pm so we started at the bar. The bartender seemed a little put off when we asked to sample the craft beer options.For me the draft options were just ok. The Deschutes IPA was the best of the bunch and at least I've had it before so I knew what I was getting into.  When finally seated at our table, we ordered a few appetizers - the pretzels with provolone cheese, the shrimp, and the zucchini fritters. The shrimp was the best of the bunch with a spicy coating. The fritters were second best but the pretzels were a disappointment. They were like pretzel rolls and huge with no real flavor. Same with the cheese. Smaller bites may have made them more enjoyable.  For an entree, I ordered the sea bass which came with barley and arugula. The fish was good and I enjoyed the crispy edges but the barley was too salty portion size was quite tiny.   The best thing about this place to me was our server who was great with explaining specials, her favorites, and refilling drinks. But when you hit a restaurant, you expect the food to stand out and it did not for me.  I'd give this place a 3 1/2 but not quite worthy of the 4th star."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch!!! The chef's special board was amazing! Bartender was very nice as well! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"LISTEN. This meatloaf was absolutely incredible. Potentially the best meatloaf I've had out. There are so many amazing things on the menu and I watched in jealousy as many tables Ordered such fun options.  I wish I was staying longer, I'd come here every night to sample something else.  I will be back for sure and look forward to sharing the the Butchers Block with a colleague."}
{"text":"Nothing too memorable about this dining experience. Pretty mediocre   I'm being generous with the stars."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe here on a Thursday evening - not too terribly crowded, but there were no downtown events scheduled. It was restaurant week however, and we dined from both menus. Hubby had the fried chicken with honey biscuit and the chicken was cooked to perfection with a crunchy flavorful exterior. The biscuit was flaky (huge) and melt-in-your mouth perfect. I chose from the RW menu and had the hummus (a bit spicy), the green chile stew (perfectly seasoned with huge chunks of short rib) and the salted caramel pudding (creamy, delicate, full of caramel flavor - and probably the best dessert I've ever had... hands down.) I would hit them up again and enjoy ordering just about anything from their hit list. Service was good, there was a tiny snafu with our order but our wait staff fixed it up in no time at all. Good for a small group of friends, date night, or stop by on your own - good beers on tap too."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try The Arrogant Butcher since they opened and finally had the opportunity when I found myself downtown with a group of friends the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.  Since were a large group and wanted to sit in the bar area to take advantage of happy hour prices we ended up waiting a long time for a table (approx. 45 min). So, we were already annoyed and extremely hungry. Not a good start. Service was pretty poor throughout the whole visit but I blame that on a combination of the place being extremely busy and us being a little rowdy and cranky. I don't know why they didn't call in all hands on a holiday weekend when a major convention was going on and a nearly sold out baseball game. They were obviously very understaffed.  We ordered a few apps right away. The artichoke hummus was good but not fantastic. The soft pretzels with cheese was the big hit of the night. Thank goodness we ordered two of those because everyone at the table couldn't get enough. Another huge plus on the hh menu was $4 Guinness pints and $3 for Santan beers. Awesome! After all that bread, everyone wanted smaller meals. Most got burgers (nothing special) and I got the roasted beèt salad. That was a fantastic salad with a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked beets but it was a little smaller than I would expect for an entree. I would recommend ordering it as a starter or along with another small plate. One of my companions got the short rib stew which he raved about as well but this also appeared to be on the small side. The best value seems to be the daily special for $25. Not bad for prime rib and all the sides... two people at the table actually managed to split this. I finished my meal with the salted caramel pudding which I had to wait about 10 minutes to eat since the runner brought it with no spoons and our server had already cleared the table and then disappeared. See what I mean about the service?  Overall, this place did not meet my expectations but I don't think I can really form a comprehensive opinion after just this one visit. I will definitely be returning at some point in the future. Three stars for now."}
{"text":"It's disappointing that this place was raved about and ended up being a place I wouldn't return to. The food was actually pretty darn good. The service on the other hand, eh... I would have overlooked it had we not had two similar experiences two days in a row. While the manager was more than apologetic, I wouldn't go back here for the pure consistency in poor service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to stumble into this restaurant by accident and I am happy we did. I wish this restaurant was in my hometown because it became my new favorite place to have dinner while in Phoenix. I had the crab stuffed chicken and it was cooked perfectly. Although I am not a huge fan of oysters, I loved the ones I was served at this restaurant as an appetizer. For dessert, I had the warm peanut butter cup which was two peanut butter cookies served in a peanut butter sauce topped with chocolate gelato. One of the best desserts I have ever had! Arrogant Butcher is a great restaurant that welcomes and seats its guests in a timely manner no matter how busy it is."}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant. I went here for my birthday and everything was great. The food, service, and atmosphere. Celeste was a fabulous server. Very informative and friendly. Their fish and chips were outstanding. Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"In town for business and had heard great things about this place. Decided to try the happy hour after work and was severely disappointed. I am a huge fan of the Moscow mule and was happy to see it on the happy hour bar menu. However, watching the bartender make it I knew it wouldn't be very good. They use a cocktail mix and add vodka. It was very heavy on lime juice an almost undrinkable.  I ordered the short rib stew for dinner and it was decent, not much short rib in it. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Other people seemed to be enjoying their food. Maybe I will give it another try next time I make it to town."}
{"text":"This place is very extraordinary! They really go above and beyond to make your experience memorable in terms of receiving great customer service and awesome food. Not to mention the house drinks they offer. Thank you Tanya for really going above and beyond.   Here's my salmon plate and after school special drink. Definitely a must try!  I'll come back here if Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The house chop salad for $5 is great, the best and biggest side salad I can remember having in a long time. The deviled eggs are also extremely yummy, not to mention perfectly coiffed.       The decor was sports bar, and felt like just another chain restaurant. Maybe it is.  I got some fish tacos, because they sounded pretty rad, and when they came (a few bites into my salad, *side-eye) they looked beautiful, but man alive were they bland! Luckily they were served with some lime wedges, which I squeezed to within an inch of their little green lives.     I'd go back though, maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the T-bone steak with grilled veggies and horseradish cream sauce. It was delicious better then the prime rib my bf had. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Yes!  I think most people eat out for food alone. However, I look for the total package, wrapped  up with a pretty bow.  This was our experience today.  A day that we needed it.  Celebrating my daughters debut at Symphony Hall I made reservations for a party of 9 which included 3 under 14.   They were very accommodating, tho I was put on hold twice to make sure it was okay to take the 9 top reservation.  They didn't wait to have us all there before we were seated.  A plus as we had my 99 year old grandfather with us and also had to wait for my daughter to change and arrive.   The food was from good to stellar, as we all ordered very different things.  Well three of us ordered the chicken stroganoff, which sounded fantastic but seemed to be missing something.  Still quite edible.  We also had the beef stew (I don't know how good it was because my grandfather wouldn't share), meatloaf (delicious) the smashed potatoes and gravy were perfect. I had the scallops, which were exactly what I needed as they were light and complemented my Arrogant 75(s) perfectly. We ordered each of the desserts to taste them all.  The peanut butter mouse (aka melted peanut butter cup) went VERY well with the hot chocolate cake. I don't know how the blueberry cheesecake was as my grandfather, again, didn't share.  But the salted caramel pudding was hands down MY FAVORITE!!! I'd come back just for that. You know what else I'd come back for? The service!! Tony was amazing!!! I love to ask questions, and he never once hesitated. His recommendations were spot on. He listened and was so much fun.  I eat out for the total package and Tony was the the perfectly tied bow on top! Can NOT wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great spot! Especially if you're from out of town like me and have no clue as to where to go but you love good food. Unique menu- I was debating between a charged wedge salad (it has rib meat in it!!) and the jambalaya. My friend landed at fish and chips after considering a chicken stroganoff with homemade egg noodles! Food was impressive.   For bevs, we opted cocktails over wine and beer. Beer menu looks great though. There's a weekly special beverage but I opted for an Aperol cocktail.  Will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"I was excited to dine at this place with friends because it received such great reviews. Unfortunately, both my husband and I thought the food was okay - not amazing.   I ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu so my meal came with an appetizer, entree and dessert. The tabbouli salad was nothing like typical middle eastern tabbouli (still not sure why they called it that) but it was good and flavorful. The portion of the salad was huge and I was able to share it with the entire table. For entree, I ordered the crab stuffed chicken. To me, it was a little dry and the flavors weren't amazing. My husband ordered the scallops on the regular menu and although the portion was a nice size, he didn't care for the flavor. His dish came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and green beans, which I thought were the best part. The salted caramel pudding dessert was by far my favorite part of the dining experience and I would definitely come back for that again. Apparently it has won awards over the years.  Overall, I thought this place was just okay. I know this is a Fox restaurant but I prefer the food and upbeat environment at Culinary Dropout (Tempe)."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers! Also, they were quick with bringing my food out. I will definitely consider going back again and trying others things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fox restaurant has service down to a T, well in this case an S I suppose. An S with a big capitol letter used for great \"service.\" I felt pretty spoiled. I have never had bad service at any of their restaurants and yesterday was no exception at my first AB visit. Kelly and team were wonderful and made us feel super spoiled.   The food was great. I had the pretzel bun Turkey Pastrami sandwich, which was Delish. The shrimp and pretzel apps are wonderful but the Carmel pudding was, \"lick the glass jar clean, to die for.\"   AB is a pretty restaurant, unique decor.    The only draw back is the price. I always find it so pricey/ costly to eat at a Fox place. However, they do have Happy Hour. Will have to go back for some more of those yummy pretzels."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....worth the drive to downtown Phoenix. The server was super sweet and helpful.... the food was incredible!  We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This visit was unlike any of the other I have had, at the Arrogant Butcher.  I was actually on a date, and he was a first timer.  The atmosphere here is super casual and a nice mix of professionals dropping in for a quick bite, as well as families and friends.  We were promptly greeted and sat at an outside table.  It was a bit breezy and sunny, maybe some sun shades would help with this, but I also didnt notice whether they had them or not. Our waiter was awesome, efficient and knowledgable.  The gentleman I was with asked about the crab stuffed chicken and then decided to order the tacos.  BORING! I got the salmon, mashed potatoes and broccollini, and it was divine.  Every time I patron Arrogant Butcher I order something different and I am never disappointed.  We also had a dozen oysters, I love the price point on these as well.  The only complaint this time around was that I had A LOT of shell to spit out with each one.  That is the only reason for 4 stars. Ill keep this review short and sweet and encourage you to try Arrogant Butcher if you havent already.  You wont be dissatisfied with anything that comes out of this \"scratch\" kitchen."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was excellent.  Highly recommend the Sea Bass and Mussels. Service was great."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday lunch because an event left me hungry and there was no way I was going to wait until my evening reservation!  The service was impeccable... and the cute, young, waiter's wide grin made dining even more pleasurable.  ;)  I started with the elephant garlic and crusty bread with olive oil.  I am such a garlic fan, and this was no exception.  Next I had the beef short rib stew.  No joke, I practically LICKED the bowl clean.  No apologies here.  It was THAT good.  I was not sure about the egg at first, but the combination of textures and flavors was amazing.    Topped lunch off with strong pink cocktail and VOILA...   Yes, I will be back.  In fact... Friday's looking good for me.  Anyone want to join?"}
{"text":"I've been way to generous with my reviews and I've made up my mind not to give five stars unless everything was impeccable.    I REALLY LOVED The Arrogant Butcher.   I picked up a menu that was on a side table at my gym, of all places.   I've looked at it for a week before finally giving in and going.  I had a lot of carbs that night, but it was worth it!  It's good when a restaurant takes you to another place, and AB did that for me.  For a while, I forgot I was in Arizona and thought I was back in Spain with friends.  The build your own appetizer concept is cool.  Just like a sushi menu, you mark off what cheeses, charcuterie meats, cold veggies, raw bar items you want and they bring them out with sides of breads, spreads, and sauces. ALL SUBLIME!  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and their attention to quality.  Hard to get good cured meats here and I'm already trying to plan my next outing to AB to get my plate of salumi and proscuitto on!  We ordered those meats, grilled asparagus, grilled mushrooms, giant white shrimp, oysters, heavenly pretzel bites with provolone fondue, marcona almonds, and a type of sheep's milk cheese very similar to manchego.  My date and I were in heaven!   Near the end we ended up making these little sandwiches by splitting the pretzel bite, spreading the fondue on one side, slice of cheese, cut up mushrooms and asparagus, and a pile of proscuitto or salumi...  ........ I couldn't stop smiling and we enjoyed ourselves so much because the food was so good!  Great conversation while nibbling on this stuff... Awesome night!    The only disappointment were the entreés... Maybe because we liked the appetizers so much we didn't feel the entreés?  I had the bolognese and my date at the sweet potato tortellis...  They were both good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Pro tip, order the peanut butter cup desert with a side of pretzel knots for dipping. Amazing combo!"}
{"text":"We came here to have our christmas team lunch together few days ago. When the team was deciding which restaurant to go to, the name of this place seems to ring a bell. I insisted to come here. As soon as I walked in, I immediately realized that I was here with friends approx a little over a year ago. Yay!!!!!  The service was great and so was the food. I ordered a BLT sandwich for entree. It was approximately  $11 (a bit pricy but my boss is paying hehe). I love how sweet the bun was and the portion was more than enough to get me full. However, the bacon was a bit overcooked for my taste. The order also comes with a side of your choice. I ordered the French fries and loved it. All of my co-workers seem to enjoy their food.   I will definitely come back here again for lunch. It is a bit pricy but no matter for good food and services. My only complaint is how tight the tables are from each other. My boss was sitting at the end of the table and the customers on the other one sitting next to us kept hitting her chair."}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews on Yelp. I selected this place for dinner. Bad idea, the service was terrible. My waitress was slow & very unprofessional. We constantly had to call her to get her attention & order. Then after finally ordering I selected the chicken & crab selection. Big mistake the chicken was very bland. No taste or flavor to it what so ever. Then the waitress had the nerve to act like it was a problem wit me not being pleased wit my food. The only part of the visit that was good was the shrimp appetizer. I'm sorry but it was far better dining spots in Phoenix than this one. Trust me I'll never be back here."}
{"text":"I work in a top 3 restaurant in LA and The Arrogant Butcher is anything but. The fish and chips were juicy, flaky, and flavorful. Devin, my server, was genuine, knowledgeable, and friendly. Management dropped off food with a smile. Only thing is, the Tuscany coffee felt more like a Greek blend to me. Ya know, because of the mountains and stuff. Just saying."}
{"text":"My job took us here last holiday season for lunch. Everything I tried was amazing. Fast, quick service. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Very fun and trendy vibe.  Loved the drink menu options, but I made a bad choice getting the \"The Pink Drink\", very sweet (I was warned) and just not what I was expecting.  The Waldorf salad was ok, but not much flavor at all.  My entree was recommended, it was chicken stuffed with crab.  Only ok.  Huge serving, it was probably enough for two.  Seemed like two chicken breasts breaded and fried, with crab in between.  Very good but not great, I would have preferred a smaller more tasty portion.  All in all a nice dinner, abiance was fantastic, but I must have made bad ordering choices because my meal was not as great I expected it to be from the looks of this place, it was pretty packed!  I'd try it again."}
