{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas, hands down. BUT, it is so expensive that I have to take 2 stars off. Their dough/sauce recipes are awesome and they're open very late with delivery. BUTTTTTTTTT, just so freaking expensive. Make your slices cheaper, or start running deals guys! Over 400% mark up on slices is craziness."}
{"text":"For years I kept coming across people who work here as well as the family who own it, I'd never been to visit the pizza place!  Honestly, I was a bit of a skeptic, but let me tell you THIS PIZZA IS THE BOMB! We only ordered the Super Cheesy and it came with these SMALL dollops of buttery ricotta cheese strategically placed around the pizza, my GOODN it was fabulous!!! My husband says it's the best pizza in town and he's from Chicago!!!"}
{"text":"Um no.  Ordered delivery tonight. The cheese pizza was flavorless, bland and just plain icky. I've never been to NY but I hope this is not an accurate representation of their pizza. If you have zero taste buds this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I will keep this review short and sweet.  PRO'S: Pizza by the slice was relatively tasty.  The cafe was clean and nicely decorated.  The service was quick.  CON'S: Premade pizza by the slice was $3.95 each and they charged an extra $0.25 for the black olives already on it.  The pizza also had to be reheated. I ordered mozzarella sticks only to be informed that the deep fryer was broken.  There goes half the menu."}
{"text":"Really amazing pizza incredible service I come here for my lunch break for work as often as I can."}
{"text":"My office ordered three 20\" pizzas, a Stromboli, and cannolis for lunch today. This was our first time ever trying Joe's.  Of the six picky eaters in the office, everyone liked the food. The pizzas are huge with thin, slightly chewy crust, plentiful toppings, and just the right amount of grease. I didn't try the Stromboli personally, but my boss who is born-and-raised New Yorker said it was the best Stromboli she's had in Arizona so that is saying something.  The canolis were very tasty - not too sweet and small enough that you can eat one without feeling terribly guilty.  This is definitely a place we will be getting delivery from again."}
{"text":"Pizza was greasy & good for a 2 AM order of pie. Unfortunately, they took an HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES to deliver to my hotel room.   I'm sure I had called during primetime, I get they have drunkies to attend to.. But they told me I would only have to wait 45 minutes, and 90 minutes later I was practically asleep."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and fast delivery service. It was hard to decide the pizza since there was such a wide selection and they all sounded great. We decided on the Manhattan Loaded and a Greek Salad and were not disappointed. We ordered on-line (painlessly through Yelp) and the delivery was on time and with friendly delivery person. We highly recommend. (I would give 5 stars but I reserve 5 for \"consistency\" over a period of time. We were passing through so I could only visit once, but I would sure go back!!)"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for when you're looking for that late night pie. Pretty good pizza overall, but those mac n cheese bites are probably my favorite thing about this place lol. I wouldn't recommend going with the delivery option but it's a really good place overall!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night and we chose Joe's because it was one of the few pizza places that was open late and we wanted to avoid the post-Marquee long lines at Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo.  Unfortunately, I wish we would have stuck to Secret Pizza.  Yes, we only had to wait 15 mins for our whole pizza order but our Manhattan Loaded pizza was..eh.  The pizza was saturated in fat and soaked thru our paper plates and the dough in the middle of the pizza didn't seem cooked enough because it stuck to the pizza box and our slices collapsed whenever we grabbed one to eat.  In addition, one whole pizza at Secret was cheaper than a whole large pizza at Joe's.  Overall, I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very laid back. The pizza is delicious and the owner is very nice."}
{"text":"I think their pizza is one of the best in the scottsdale area if your really looking for that thin crust. Great flavor good toppings however, I didn't really appreciate the price from going to 18$ for a large meatball pizza to 23$... never will understand the high price jump and there is really no valuable explanation for it so therefore my family and I won't be coming back for a very long time. Sorry"}
{"text":"When ever I am in the area I stop by for a slice. Huge variety of by the slice pizzas. Always served hot and fresh. The parking is easy also."}
{"text":"Excellent meatball sandwich. One of the best I've had. Pizza is ok."}
{"text":"Joes pizza is real authentic New York Pizza. He uses the correct ovens that have the stone he doesn't use the conveyor belt ovens  like dominoes and little Caesars the pizza is very good that's all I had was the pizza so that's what I'm rating..The  Employee that took my money was friendly and the place looks pretty clean"}
{"text":"Called them late night for pizza delivery (that's why you have late night hours, right?). They quote me 1 hour for my pizza delivery. Pizza never shows up. I call the pizzeria to get the status of my delivery and they tell me it's still on the way. Over an hour passes and the pizza still isn't here. Call the pizzeria again but at this point they are closed so they don't pick up. Never got the food. Pretty disappointing! This is the second time this has happened so unfortunately I won't be calling Joe's again."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Had the one with pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese topping. The goat cheese on the pepperoni made me happy. The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside to leave me with a pleasant mouth feel."}
{"text":"Called tonight (Friday night at 10:15) to order a pizza for pickup, seeing that their hours on this Yelp page say open until 11pm Fri-Sat. They told me they were closed for the night... confused why they have their hours down as one time but decide to do something differently at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm shocked there are no reviews for this place. It's by far the best pizza I've tasted in Las Vegas.  Give it a shot. Lunch specials are perfect.  (Just realized this place didn't have 5 starts)  Not sure why people wouldst give it 5 starts)"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  As others have said its off strip, yet close to the hard rock.  I'm a local and always bring my NY clients here to show them just how great Vegas pizza is.  Havn't had a single one not be impressed.  There is limited seating inside and some seating outside."}
{"text":"Great New York Style Pizza. Just like what you would expect to get in NY or Jersey. Legit crust and sauce.  Have yet to try other menu items because the pizza is so delicious."}
{"text":"YES YES! NY Pizza for sure! Upon entering I was greeted by a very nice straight forward lady. I made it known that i was visiting from NYC and i heard great things about this place and she said (very confidently) you heard right and you wont be dissapointed. Oh boy was she right! One bite and i was back in Manhattan! Too bad i been eating out of the other \"NY\" places around here this whole time :(.  So good! I wish you guys the best! So mad I only ordered 2 slices."}
{"text":"The caprese panini is delicious and I would order that again.   The pizza though, which is the main thing here - meh.  Overpriced, stingy with the toppings and a crust that is nothing special (actually, too thin)."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to defend Joe's because of the many great times getting pizza from them.  I'm a New Yorker to the bone and this place looks like an NY Pizzeria that you get slices in or order a regular or pie with toppings. Like most places they have their pizza around $3 to $4 per slice which at this point is the going rate in most of the country.    Order slices of pizza here, they will put it in the oven and take it out when it's hot. Then you pay. It's pretty simple concept.  Yes they have salads and sandwiches which I have never had but understand their specialty is delicious pizza by the slice.  If you really want a salad you should go somewhere else.    I have gotten delivery once during the day and the pizza was great and quickly delivered.  But those of you ordering drunk food after midnight I just don't know what you expect. Where else around Old Town is open past the bars?  If you're mad about the price ask about it before you agree on ordering the food."}
{"text":"ok, first of all the reason i`ve taken the time to write this...they charged my credit card 3x for one transaction!! good thing i checked online once i returned home. the pizza was dry, old and salty...i asked them to warm it up and not only did they get my order confused but was told that most of slices there under glass were already warm...WRONG, not warm...they warmed a couple pieces up and it was better than cold but very disappointing all around...was hoping the hotwings would save the day, but NO...not only did they come late (at least they were fresh?), but they weren`t crispy and were pretty fatty....to top it off, a junkie (drug addict) entered the bathroom and appeared to come out jacked up on whatever he brought in there....years ago this wouldn`t have phased me, but after long road trip and my family with me, it was the icing on the cake.....AVOID this place!! your money is best dropped elsewhere...if you must go, use cash as they apparently think the credit card machine is their own slot machine and they can play it like their own players club"}
{"text":"I read a ton of reviews to find a spot that had good food and New York style pizza. So after a ton of research, I decided to go with this place, and I'm glad i did. They came at a time you would expect delivery to. Not too late, but you're always anxiously waiting for your food, as was I. When it did get to the front door, and we could dig in, we loved it. We got the White Truffle Pizza and Garlic Knots. Both were delicious. We did wish the pizza had a little more sauce. It was good but a little dry, and the garlic knots could have been a little more potent in flavor, but all in all, it was all pretty tasty and I have  feeling we'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Great service & variety! Pizza done right! Tried to leave a nice short review and the system wants an essay?"}
{"text":"Yesterday my wife, granddaughter and I went to Joe's New York Pizza with my granddaughter's service dog.  My granddaughter suffers from PTSD and severe depression.  Upon entering this establishment, the manager came out from behind the counter and told us we couldn't bring the dog into his establishment.  At that point, he began to raise his voice while telling us to leave.  I attempted to tell him it was a service dog to help her, but he drowned me out while yelling over me.  We left the establishment without further discussion, and my granddaughter was forced to take her meds to calm herself down.  Three hours later she was still visably upset and crying over the incident.  Whether you go to this establishment is totally up to you.  My point for writing this post is to warn other individuals with disabilities to know in advance this establishment does not follow the ADA Laws that the Federal Government and the State of Nevada has established for people with disabilities."}
{"text":"The service and pizza here is great. The ambience here is awesome such a well put together pizza spot! Very quaint and family type atmosphere. I recommend Joe's to everyone especially pizza lovers! Definitely a stop to make while in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've made 3 attempts to buy pizza from Joe's and only one was successful.  It was good but my experiences have been bizarre to say the least. I heard that Joe's had really good New York style pizza and as an East Coast transplant, I'm always looking for good pizza. The first time I tried to get pizza was about a year ago. I called and asked if I could order a Sicilian pie to pick up. They took my order and I hung up. About 1/2 hour later my phone rings and the caller ID says the call is from Alaska. I almost didn't pick up but I did and it was Joe's calling back(Alaska - I thought they were from NY?? ok people move around - keep old cell phone numbers or maybe it was an employee - whatever) but they tell me that oops I can't have Sicilian pizza because they don't have any Sicilian dough. Wait what? This is a Pizzeria right? It's Saturday night right??? In downtown Scottsdale right??? Forget it.   My second order a few months later for plain take out pizza went fine and it was good. The reason I felt compelled to write this review is experience #3 which happened about a week ago. It was weirder than the first one. Decided to give Joe's another try for the Sicilian pizza. I called and someone answered but there were long silences and I was like \"Hellooo?\" \"anyone there??\" and I had a very hard time understanding the person who answered the phone. It was like they were training or speaking to someone else while talking to me. Another reviewer mentioned an answering service and while I think that is super strange for a pizza place, that's what it felt like. Anyway I asked for Sicilian and she said they don't have that. I said you don't have Sicilian pizza? But it's on the menu. She said they only have the specialty pizza with everything on it. I said that's it? Only one type of pizza and it has everything on it? Nothing else? She said yes. I hung up."}
{"text":"Tried the humongous white spinach pizza and added pepperoni to it. The crust was baked to perfection and the ricotta cheese added texture to the pizza and really complemented all the flavors of the spinach  and pepperoni. The service was also excellent, the friendly staff were really helpful. Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"My go to pizza joint when I am in Vegas. Best if you order a whole fresh made pizza than by the slice."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I'm glad I tried this place out! Everybody should try their veggie pizza and cannoli"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best pizza places you'll find in Scottsdale that's open late. After a long night of partying, Joes is definitely the spot to be to eat after Old Town has done you in.  My favorite thing about this place is that if you work in the nightlife industry (lucky for me!) you get a discount and the staff is extremely friendly to all!   This is my favorite place to go after work and while on break!"}
{"text":"Ordered Joe's special pizza. It took 1 hour to been delivered. Was nothing close to call SPECIAL pizza - would say regular pizza."}
{"text":"Not NY pizza. Not using true pizza oven. Bad service. Ignored by punks at counter. Will never be back. Attention owner:  why is your business not growing. Answer weak team and you are not there running it."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. It should be called Joe's tourist trap pizza because it's not even close to New York pizza. It's very expensive and subpar at best. I ordered a slice of just cheese.  It was very thin in the middle, large crusted at the end, very little sauce and very little cheese. For five dollars a slice claiming to be award winning New York pizza, I expected a lot better. I'm from New York and have been to the REAL Joe's pizza in the Village many times. When I asked what part of New York the owners from, I was told he's from Bulgaria. Really... Apparently just another guy jumping on the  New York pizza bandwagon. Being a pizza lover that's actually from New York I find this place in insult"}
{"text":"This was a nice little place of the strip to get a place to eat. The pizza was good but unfortunately not great. The service was really good, and even though we showed up minutes before closing they still let us order and eat in. It's definitely a good little place to get a quick bit to eat of some good pizza."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what is better, the food or the service! The 1st time I stopped in the friendly young lady at the front counter not only actually listened to my question she gave me a recommendation, I followed her advice and had 1 of the best calzones I've had in years! On my next visit my son and I ended up getting pizza and we BOTH loved it! All I can say is I'll be sure to get back as soon and as often as possible, definitely a great meal at a fair price!"}
{"text":"I've always been impressed with their pizza. Much better than the other place down the street. All the workers are friendly and I love how you can see everything being made! I get nervous when you can't watch your food being prepped in the back. I've worked food service before and the stories are true.  Great pizza, good service what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas a lot and when I want pizza this is the place I go to.  The pizza is great and they are big slices.  Location is right across the Hard Rock so it is easy to get too.  The place is family run and the son who runs the place is great.  I have talked to him a couple times and he always treats me like family.  Highly recommend it.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!  I recommend the thin crust meat lovers..."}
{"text":"If you are from  NY  and love NY style pizza this is hands down the best place!  I'm from the NYC area and live off of pizza. This place gets five stars  for the quality of their food. It is just a bonus that it is open late night as well. The owner is amazing and takes care of everyone that comes in. I feel like family here!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for a party, needed delivery and no hassle. The food was ordered from GrubHub. The pizza, sandwich and garlic knots were delivered within 35 minutes to hotel room and were hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Anna who took our large order was patient and friendly. The delivery driver was polite and right on time. Food was perfect!!!! This was our first time ordering from them . Hearts On Fire Team  Thank you! We will order from you guys again and refer business to you!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but every time I see \"New York\" and \"pizza\" together I hope, but it never is the same! (I am a LV native whose only been to NY a few times, but pizza here and pizza there are 2 different foods. This place is \"OK' Las Vegas pizza. (Could the other reviewers have gone after a night of partying and not been properly objective?)"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere. Exceptional restroom. Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Little soggy crust so I had to take off a few stars. Also, have better pizza options in Vegas so 3/5"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! The pizza was a tiny bit oily, but full of flavor. The side salad was great and we were able to enjoy a large pizza and side salad for three meals. This place delivered promptly to our hotel as well. Definitely worth ordering if you're tired and want a nice easy meal delivered to your doorstep."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. Our side salads were fresh lettuce and lots of tomatoes, pepper, onions.  The fresh cut French fries were prepared perfectly.  Mozzarella sticks we're the best we've ever had.  What a great place."}
{"text":"Good pizza joints are hard to find in Vegas.  This place hit the spot.  My family ordered pasta with meatballs, a salad, the chicken parm calazone, and a cheese pizza.  The prices were fair.  The service was the bomb.  And the atmosphere was fun - perfect for a young family."}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  Pizza, salad and pasta are all excellent.  They have a great coke machine.  I just love the food here!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Two thumbs up, real N.Y style pizz. Just gotta try, trust me"}
{"text":"So for a number of reasons that I won't go into, we got a free pizza delivered from Joe's the other night for dinner.  Half pepperoni, half chicken pesto.  I was highly unimpressed.  Even after I lowered my expectations due to the fact that it was delivered and free.    The pizza was cold.  Crust was bland and rather cardboard-ish.  The cheese was waxy.  Toppings were not very flavorful.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a free meal.  However, a free meal is always an opportunity to get or keep a customer.  Based on the pizza I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Joe's for years, I've seen many employees come and go. I hate doing this, I'm not generally one to complain, but one of the new employees happens to make me extremely uncomfortable. She's pleasant in a corporate robot sort of way, she doesn't make jokes or ask how my day was. Which I'm not saying they should roll out the red carpet for me, but I feel that is just common courtesy to ask simple questions like that. I've stopped coming in as regularly and usually try to avoid her. All the other employees are great, I have nothing ill to say about anyone else, just this lady. I don't know her name, but she's on the tall side, not exactly skinny and doesn't do her job well.  The food however is excellent! I suggest getting delivery! Definitely the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Ordered the simplest thing, an 18 inch with mushroom and pepperoni.  When calling to place the order, they asked cash or credit, and we said cash. After over an hour, this smug delivery guy shows up and asks for 21.50.  All I had were two 20s - and he only had 6 dollars in change!  He didn't even apologize or try to fix the problem, just gave me a smug look and took 34 dollars for a 21 dollar order!  Real classy.  And the pizza was cold, greasy, and generally quite awful.  Super stingy with toppings.    Avoid this place at all costs.  An absolute rip-off that makes a sucky pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! Their pepperoni pizza and barbecue wings are my favorite. The crust is so good and it's what makes this my favorite pizza place. I would honestly recommend to anyone in Scottsdale wanting a good pizza for a really good price."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, by far. Been crushing this pizza since day it opened. Eating in the way to go. Unfortunately the delivery guys always seem to forget the Parmesan cheese or some other side. If they could get that in check and you knew you where getting a hot pizza w/everything you ordered 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you like soggy crust and extra salty pizza my husband says this place is for you! (This is the best Vegas had to offer?) They did deliver and it was fast, but, gee....."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for sure - we were in town from NY and this hit the spot!  The place was friendly and we would recommend for your pizza fix."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets if you are in Old Town!  The pizza is as good as it gets in Phoenix.  I would put it up against Bianco's downtown any day!  Don't go real late night because you run into drunk fools, but if you go early you can get a great slice very cheap and still have time to enjoy yourself without being harrased!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in over a year and we're happy to see that they are still around. They are just as good as the last time we were here!  We always get the pizza by the slice so everyone can get what they want individually. Their prices are about the same as other \"by the slice\" places but their pizza is delicious.  Nice place. Love the collage of vintage style posters on the wall. =)"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a slice. No complaints. I'm easy with pizza so I'm not the best person to rely on taste, but this was good enough for me. I would definitely come back. Had A slice of Hawaiian and a slice of Pepperoni."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty pizza.  Positives: you can order by the slice, they have a frequent miler card (3 slices for price of 2), and open late.  To me, the right amount of sauce and cheese ratio.  Negatives: long lines during clubbing nights."}
{"text":"Joe's of New York rocks!! They donated all the food for spaghetti dinner and were absolutely the most amazing catering team I have worked with!!  Please... as the co-chair of the event that served 470 people!!!..... We can't thank you enough.....Delizioso!  Thanks Joe's-- Laurie you and your team are \"A\" number 1, king of the hill, New York....... New York!!!!!....... Grazie from Our Lady of Perpetual Help's Family  Activities Team!!  Can you say.... Yum!!!!!!!!! And don't even get us started on the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, just the way we like it! We ordered pepperoni pizza to go and it was OMG delicious. The young man who took our order was very pleasant and courteous. We waited less than 15 minutes for our pizza to cook and it was well worth it. I like the variety that Joe's menu offers, and the quality of their pizza dough is what really seals the deal for our family. We like our crust this but not crispy or crunchy and Joe's New York Pizza does it to perfection. Of course we will return to try a different OMG delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, quick delivery. Minus 1 star - perfect would be free delivery and there is a small charge."}
{"text":"The guy ordering take out was soooooo nice! The calzones are fantastic! And HUGE! If u order it take out ask for a lot of extra sauce! They only gave one little thing of marinara. The Greek salad is delicious too!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Scottsdale and were looking to get a pizza. Staff was not friendly to begin with. We decided on a BBQ Chicken pizza. The worst pizza we've ever eaten. OMG, if we wouldn't have paid $21 for it, we would've tossed it to the trash. Couldn't taste any bbq sauce on it, it was just sweet like honey, the chicken tasted like it was boiled in hot water with no seasonings and the crust was chewy. I don't usually write reviews but it was so bad I feel I have to warn people. Spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza by the slice on display and ready to go. Friendly service was appreciated. Nice decor and clean facilities."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12 inch pizza which came out to be $14 and after taxes it was $17. Of course I didn't order enough to meet the minimum delivery requirement so I ordered wings. The wings were so greasy that I couldn't get the grease stain of my white countertop. After the entire order including tip, I spent around $30 (not worth it). This piece of cardboard wasn't worth more than $5. New York pizza slices are large and usually takes a large fold over in order to handle and eat. Joes pizza was like picking up a slice of microwaveable Totinos pizza. Hardly a New York style pizza. I guess this place is in a good area to feed the drunk Scottsdale masses but if you are sober then stay away."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza the best I've had on the West Coast. I'm from the East where pizza originating from and this pizzeria comes so close to capturing the essence of traditional Italian flat pizza. Tip: try the Manhattan loaded (delicious)!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Las Vegas. My boyfriend and I was on our way to joes and on our way in saw a guy drop his whole pizza. The lady at the counter was so nice she offered to give them another whole pizza. Wow great service, affordable, and amazing food."}
{"text":"We ordered the family special with Pizza, wings and garlic knots. Everything was so delicious! They delivered earlier than they said and everything was just as ordered! We would 100% recommend Joe's."}
{"text":"Food is average but better than some other local places. Found the service to be sub-par. Based on some of the reviews I expected much better. With an improvement of service I may have given 3 stars."}
{"text":"I never eat the crust.but i devoured the one at Joe's...the best pizza.  I had the fully loaded slice with sausage, spaghetti, ham, mushrooms, bacon, and anything else they could dream of"}
{"text":"Pizza is okay but the people that work there are awesome. They are always friendly, the lady boss says hi to me every time I go in. The pizza could be less greasy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, open until 4 am good food always on time and great staff... #1 with the Days Inn"}
{"text":"Thank god for this place! I stayed at the Hard Rock located across the street and just wanted some good food for not big bucks! Both times i came to Las Vegas i came here! They have more then you typical cheese and pepperoni. Also there portions are big and it only cost 3-4 bucks a slice. I had pepperoni and jalapeno slice...yummm. Also had BBQ chicken. Cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Massive slices.  Not greasy.  Very friendly staff.  Clean restaurant.  Stopped in this place after driving by on the way home from the office.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the VERY well decorated space.  Pictures and other various things surround you and make you feel as if though you are in NYC.  The second thing you notice is how MASSIVE the slices are!  They're HUGE!  My gf and I ordered a large (8 slices) pizza with two toppings on each half, came out to be $20 and change.  I was skeptical at first paying that much for a pizza, but we were both VERY pleased.  The pizza was ready in about 10 minutes and it was very well cooked and presented. Another thing with NY style pizza is that some other ones in the area tend to be greasy where as this one was not at all.  I apologize for not having a photo to share as we were both so hungry that as soon we got home we cracked open the box and ate the whole thing :)  Overall, very happy and will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Guy taking my order was a jerk. Thanks for killing my night. He couldn't understand what I was requesting. He had a strong accent. I forgive him I suppose. Looking for another place to eat. 38.88 not spending it here...."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay, but it's hard to get past the fact that the slices here are far more expensive than any NYC place I've ever been to. A lunch of three slices and two sodas was $21. Quality of pizza doesn't come close to justifying the price."}
{"text":"The manager at night sucks and the actual pizza cook is the only one that knows what's going on. I ordered a full pizza and the other stupid employee decided it was a good idea to serve it to customers walking in, now the third time in a row they messed up and proceeded not to fix it along with insulting my intelligence by saying oh I can take half one pizza plus 2 and another 2 is 8 so it's the same as a full pizza they also don't wear gloves or wash their hands"}
{"text":"Greasy disgusting and expensive. No chance I'd order again. I can't speak for anything other than the pizza. Really poor quality."}
{"text":"Most of us who crave pizza are either drunk or having a cheat day. Well this is my FAVORITE pizza place to go for either of those. Their 18\" pizzas are cheesy and greasy, and pair perfectly with ranch. Keep up the good pizza!"}
{"text":"I really had my doubts about this place because it seemed a lot like gus's or tessio's but it in no way compared. I found it to be probably one of my favorite pizza's  in the valley. I definitely think it's worth a taste."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! They delivered to our office on the Strip and everyone was so impressed, all 3 large sized pizzas were gone before I could get a second slice. The cheese pizza had a perfect crust with just the right thickness; soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. If you're staying on the strip and want pizza delivered to your room, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this pizza was amazing. I was in town (from NY) and needed something for myself and my girlfriend to eat late at night. Man, this pizza was spot on NY style. The best pizza I have had outside of NY. If you are hungry at any time of day, go here. Try the Hawaiian pizza because that was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, however the prices are,..hard to call acceptional.   The manager lady should consider an attitude adjustment. Absolutely unprofessional.   1 star.."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate giving1 star reviews however they just did not live up to their commitment whatsoever. Order placed, and never showed. I called and called and each time was told \"sorry, but we do not accept delivery orders this late\".  I completely respect that business practice; however then: (1) do not say you will deliver; (2) do not take my order; (3) do not act self righteous when I call 45 minutes later asking where my food is; and (4) try to fix the problem. Sorry to inconvenience you by attempting to order some food."}
{"text":"First thing that I had an issue with is that this restaurant was located literally a mile away from my residence and the driver didn't arrive with the delivery until an hour and a half late. IMO, I think that he decided to arrive at my location last after he made the rest of his deliveries. The pizza was luke warm, but very delicious. The french fries were cold and too soft and wet. So it was 50/50 for me!  Wow, had to edit my review, bcuz, tried this restaurant again yesterday 10/12/13. the order was worse than b4. First off, small cheese pizza, disgusting, bland, barely no sauce, and the cheese was half off the pizza, in laying inside the box, oily and greasy! the side salad was wilted, bcuz the delivery had it sitting on top of the pizza box. total waste of $18.00 delivered...never again!!!"}
{"text":"New owners new crazy prices 2 slices and 2 cans of coke $12 was in NYC last week 2 slices and a coke $5. The pizza tastes like crap all cheese and bread no sauce at all."}
{"text":"Very good food and stuffs?Italian panini sandwiches,salads and pizza are great"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place to get late night food they are open late every single night whenever I need a late night snake I always end up here definitely like the jalapeno pepperoni by the slice it's good for late night but maybe not the best for daytime"}
{"text":"If you are planning on having food delivered from Joes think again. Called this place 3 different times with the same result every time, being put on hold for over ten minutes. Pizza is great here its just a shame you cant get it delivered to your home if you want take out. Stills gets a favorable rank due to the quality of pizza."}
{"text":"I think this is the best pizza in Vegas. I've had Ray's pizza in Manhattan and I like Joe's better. Big slices and they don't skimp on the ingredients.  They have a wide selection of pizza by the slice or they will throw together whatever you want. I've been to both locations in Vegas (Next to CVS/pharmacy across from Hard Rock and Las Vegas Blvd, parking lot of Las Vegas Outlet Mall). The best pizza to have with ranch dressing for sure. Salads are incredible. The wings are kickin. Overall, a great place to eat. The staff is super cool, too. You won't find anything like it in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's the best pizza place in old town on weekend after clubbing good food good service clean place  Definitely I recommend it"}
{"text":"We just had  lunch  with my friends. Great New Your style pizza,  like  always. We had  Italian sausage sub as well,with grill onions, grill peppers and cheese. Delicious! Very clean and service very friendly. Planing to go back soon."}
{"text":"I can't believe they have the balls to call this \"New York pizza.\" Tastes like frozen crust and for the price you're better off buying a DiGiorno."}
{"text":"Fantastic, Wonderful, Awesome, I can't believe it.  Are you kidding me?  NY Pizza in AZ?    YES, IT IS TRUE !!!!!   Not only was the lady on the phone extremely nice but she chatted with me about NY and that was cool.  OK, now for the Pizza...  Pizza = Fantastic, just like back in Brooklyn. Delivery = Holy Crap, I barely had time to change the channels and the guy was at the door.  This guy (born and raised in NY) gives this Pizza 2 Thumbs UP!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas !!! Went there few times. Really close from the strip and the pizzas are really tasty ! You can either buy by piece or a entire one. Perfect stop after work. Sometimes I wish it could be open all night long :)."}
{"text":"Ordered my usual Greek Salad w Creamy Feta dressings... the firt couple times I ordered, it was stacked with all the ingredients now I'm lucky if I get half of the toppings it comes with.. best salad I've had but wish they weren't so greedy and make it like they used to. .. We also ordered garlic knots they arrived burnt at the tips. I called the restaurant to let them know and the manager was very apologetic , they even went as far as sending the driver back with a replacement!  Great Service..Good Food!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza in AZ!   I lived in NYC for five years and when I returned home, I yearned to find pizza in Scottsdale/Phoenix as good as what I enjoyed while living in New York. There are many places that claim to be NY style pizza but Joe's New York Pizza is the real deal! Their cheese is absolutely delicious and all the toppings I tried so far knock it out of the park. Their crust is perfectly thin and crunchy in all the right places. A true giveaway that they know how to make pizza.   I've read a lot of reviews that are not that great - sometimes due to service or what have you. But trust me if you are looking for NY style pizza, this joint is the place. They also have garlic powder (a staple in NY pizzerias) available to sprinkle on your pizza, just ask them for it.   Thank you Joe's New York Pizza for answering my cravings for NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"Joe's has excellent food. Previously being from New York I am always looking for good NY pizza and calzones. Their pizza, meatballs, and calzones are great! We have eaten their many times and even had delivery a few times. They are open really late so a 2am pizza can actually happen. It would be great if there was more parking. All in all, great food and we will definitely visit again and again."}
{"text":"The best spot to go for a very good Slice of New York Pizza good people good food you can tell they care make sure you try the sausage and pepperoni it's amazing the calzones are amazing 2"}
{"text":"STICK WITH THE PIZZA. I've had the pizza twice on separate occasions, and both times it was really good. Pizza is what this place is good at. Everything else? Not so much.  We ordered today for a delivery to the Thomas & Mack Center, told the girl on the phone \"Thomas & Mack Center\", we get a call an hour later because the driver is on the other side of campus. Ok........  I ordered a pesto panini for $9.45. NO WAY a sandwich this small should cost this much and not be inside a casino. I asked if the sandwich at least came with fries, and I was told no. So, I decided to order fries as well. When we finally got our delivery, The delivery driver informed me that my panini came with potato chips, but since I didn't say which ones I wanted he just brought a random bag. What??? If the girl taking our order on the phone had told me that, I would have held off on ordering a $4.00 order of oil-soaked, unsalted, soggy fries that I didn't end up eating in the first place. Not cool man.  My co-worker ordered mild chicken tenders and fries, she said her chicken was good, but the mild sauce was super bland. She didn't end up using too much of it. Her fries also were the same oil-soaked, unsalted soggy ones that I ordered. She also threw most of them away. We were pretty disappointed this time considering the pizza(chicken pesto) we ordered last time was REALLY good.  Bottom line, their pizza is really good and worth the price. I recommend the chicken bacon ranch and the chicken pesto pizzas. Stay away from everything else."}
{"text":"Ordered so much food to be delivered.  It was my sons birthday.  Cheese fries ....gross.  Chicken fingers no flavor.   Pan pizza .....so much dough and sick flavor....threw it away.  I don't think I would give it to a dog.    Chicken Caesar salad....yuck.  Sandwich....horrible.  Subway is much better.    Nothing good to say and spent over 60.00 feel burned.  I will not be returning...to bad because they are close to my home."}
{"text":"Worst review I have yet to post on Yelp. I have not tasted the product of Joes Pizzas. Only because I called 4 different times on a Friday night- only to be hung up on each time I called. I was told it was busy and then hung up on immediately. I count inured to call to tell the individual we were hung up on- and he kept hanging up on me.  I own a pizza location myself at an undisclosed location and was disappointed  and hope the owner fires whom ever was handling calls this night. April 9, 2016 the night of."}
{"text":"When in customer service you shouldn't curse at your customers. I just hung up. How terrible."}
{"text":"i give them 5 stars for the slice of pepperoni pizza and 2 stars for the pepperoni calzone so i will average it to 4 stars overall. the problem i had with the calzone is that apparently it is a three-topping calzone and if i order the pepperoni calzone, it appears that i get three times the pepperonis. so what happened is that the pepperonis didn't cook too well and they were just warm inside but still appeared raw. now the pizza slice was 10/10!!!! i wish i had ordered the large pizza instead of the calzone! i will stick only to pizza from now on. my calzone days are over thanks to this experience. i just don't want to eat raw toppings so maybe it's better that i just eat a pizza so the toppings are cooked well."}
{"text":"The dough is none like no other here in town... it's like having a peice of New York in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Best of Phoenix. They just get it. Crispy crust that stands up to gravity on one side, and is soft and chewy on the other. Melty mozz, and sauce that is not too sweet. Open late, and they even threatened to deliver all the way to North Phoenix on a slow night. Too bad for me there aren't any slow nights. Eat it."}
{"text":"Expensive for some lousy NY-style pizza. Cost $35 for 2 larges! The pizza itself was greasy and fairly untasty. Better off with Barro's or hungry howie's."}
{"text":"Says they deliver until 2am. Called at 12:30am and they were a bit rude about telling me they had already stopped delivery. Maybe high expectations on my part but if you advertise certain hours they should be honored......still hungry."}
{"text":"the pizza was good. it ended there. the owner was rude and disrespectful and called me and my friend a c*unt. Would NOT give someone like that my money"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. I came back from Calgary Alberta to grab a slice. A must try! My favorite is the \"Meat Pie\", it has meatballs on it. It is located beside the Hard Rock hotel."}
{"text":"The calzones are really freaking good! At just under $10, they are massive and overstuffed with your filling of choice. Would give this place 4 stars for the calzones alone however when it comes to the pizza, sandwiches and salads, it's a bit lacking compared to other \"authentic\" pizzerias around the valley."}
{"text":"Our soccer team traveled from Phx for a tournament and  we all ate at Joes Pizza  for our team dinner.  Kriszti and her staff were absolutely amazing!  The food and service was great! The portions were generous .  I highly recommend this place  to anyone.  Thank you for treating our team so well-  we appreciated everything  you and your staff did for us!  We highly recommend Joes to anyone!"}
{"text":"I give this pizza a 5+ star first time using the Yelp app to place a order.  I was trying to order using Bitequad then tried to place a order using Grunhub pages kept getting stuck so while on Yelp I decided to look at some of the reviews while visiting I decided to check out JOES'S PIZZA page the surpreme look so delicious I decided to order a surpreme 10\"inch pizza This pizza is SO!! SO!!!  \"Fabulous\".  Actually has a good tasting red sauce an real mozzarella that actually pulls as you are eating it.  Couldn't eat it all so I put in frig to warm later mozzarella wasn't stuck to dough \"   GOOD BYE \"PIZZA HUT\" FAREWELL \"DOMINO\"S oh! Let me not forget \"BROTHER\" \"PA JOHN\"...WILL  NO LONGER BE MY FRIENDS.  WELL   AT JOE'S PIZZA......"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but definitely on the pricey side.  Not a terrible option if you are right there trying to find a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and was pretty excited. They got my order completely wrong. My food was burned. The calzone was 90% bread. Hardly any cheese. I had asked for no ranch on my buffalo chicken sandwich and there was tons of ranch on it. There wasn't even buffalo sauce on the chicken. It came in a very tiny container. Not even enough for one side of the sandwich.  The delivery guy was peeved at his tip. Honestly, everything about this place was just unpleasant. I won't be going back or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to many pizza places, but Joe's, by far, is my favorite. There are so many varieties of slices, it seems like they always have a new one, I haven't tried before. The staff is very friendly, the place has a simple yet inviting ambiance. Every time I go to Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise, I'm sure to stop by for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I am from out of town. This is a small place no frills great crispy crust pizza. The sauce is excellent and cooked perfect."}
{"text":"I've eaten at pizza shops all over the country, Joes is definitely on my top 5. Their subs are also amazing."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, great pizza and bad service at the Paradise location. In the past I have encountered rude staff. Yesterday was my last straw. The guy at the register wanted to argue about using the restroom prior to ordering- not using any customer service skills but equating it to not listening to cops. What?!? I have emailed the company about the issue but it was one of a handful of times their service staff has provided subpar service."}
{"text":"Great slice of NY Cheese pizza. Crust has nice crunch. Consistent quality.  They are always very friendly and the reheat on slices always taste great."}
{"text":"As a college student who spent a year living on campus, this was a great place to walk over to after a class and grab a slice of pizza or some wings. both are good, not the greatest you will ever eat, but surely good and worth what you pay for. The staff is friendly, there is an HDTV always showing sports when you walk in and its not that loud. This is a great place to grab a cheap bite if you are over at unlv, or over at the hard rock."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered here yesterday for pickup. Staff was very friendly, and pizza was ready when we walked in the door. We ordered bbq wings, baked pot fries, a small pizza with half buffalo and bbq. The pizza was amazing, the baked pot fries was a big portion(and very good). We will definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"I got into my hotel after a whole day of traveling and having nothing to eat, so I was starving. I basically went onto yelp and chose the pizza place that had the best deal/reviews/veggie options that delivered. Joes came up (out of a good 10+ other pizza joints in the area!), so I went with them. I called them, made my order, and it was done. I was kind of suspicious that they didnt mention what the price was going to be, but I figured that a two topping veggie pizza couldnt be that expensive.  The delivery boy showed up to my hotel room pretty promptly, but the bill was for over $25! I couldn't believe it, thats more than twice what I regularly pay back home (in Los Angeles mind you, where nothing is cheap!), so I was very disappointed there. The pizza was pretty good though, but I dont think I would ever pay that much for a pizza again if I can avoid it! Next time I'll just walk around the corner to the other pizza place and give them a try."}
{"text":"I went with a group of pizza lovers to check this place out. I hail from the land of GREAT pizza, (NY and Philly) so I was pleasantly surprised with finding a good NY pizza place in the land of notoriously bad pizza, aka Las Vegas.  I had the daily special which was around  $8 for 1 pepperoni and 1 cheese slice with a soft drink. The pizza was really good. It could have been hotter but since they were trying to serve 28 of us I think they hurried the process a bit.   The end crust was way too thick for true NY pizza but not a big deal. There was plenty of seating and the place was really clean.   Some other people in our group were noticing that Joe's did not serve beer which is strange for a Vegas eatery so not sure what happened there. (They booze you up everywhere else in this town).  If you want a slice of NY pizza this is the best one I have found. So far anyway......"}
{"text":"I love to go just for cheese pizza. Some of the best I've had. Good stuff..."}
{"text":"Ok so there really isnt any good new york style pizza around where we live so we gave this place a couple second chances. The pizza is starting to grow on me and now I look forward to grabbing a slice from Joe's because gosh darnit it really is pretty tasty! As for the garlic knots, well those didnt get any tastier after a second try but this place is still worth going to just for the delicious, nearly perfect new york style pizza. They also have the famous east coast tasty cake products that they sell individually for only a dollar! Definetely adds to the allure of the pizza when you know you can get a tasty cake to finish off your meal! Second Overall I give this place a \"Mmmmm, tasty cheese pizza tastes yummy and make my tummy happy\""}
{"text":"Oh my! This pizza is addictive. I absolutely love it. There is no pizza in Scottsdale other than Streets of New York that compares. I've got my son hooked on it too. He always asks to make a special trip over to get a few slices.  The eating area is serviceable and fairly clean, with a good view out of the window. Sports usually on TV, which fits. The place is filled with NYC memorabilia from various teams. The woman who runs it seems like a typical no-nonsense New Yorker, so if that's not your style, fa-get-bout-it! Go somewhere else. The pizza is incredible and it is consistent in its recipe. Very important! And yes, they do stay open late. Some have complained about the different prices from regular hours compared to midnight and beyond. To me, it makes sense. If people want to eat pizza at 2:30 am, be prepared to pay a lot more for it. Its the big-city way. Someones gotta pay for the employees to hang around all night. In short, get yourself over to Joe's Pizza. Try it plain or Hawaiian style. This is REAL New York Style pizza all the way."}
{"text":"Terrible!  My cabbie told us this was the best pizza in Las Vegas. I don't know what he got out of it, but it was awful. The crust was, the toppings were actually decent, but the cheese tasted life cafeteria pizza at my junior high school.   The slices at 1pm on a sunday afternoon looked like they had been sitting out from last night, and the price wasn't very good.   I cannot recommend. It was such a disapointment, and I was totally starving that morning craving some good pizza."}
{"text":"Joes new york pizza is on my list every time I go to Vegas,  while its not the best pizza I have ever had, they are open late and they satisfy.  We were not a fan of Metro Pizza so Joes is the go to spot until we find another that is better.  The staff is super friendly and the wait time is very reasonable."}
{"text":"An hour and a half waiting for a pizza!!!!!! This is ridiculous, we have no idea if the order is even on the way."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent, but the service was absolute crap:   Co-worker and I came here for lunch. He got a 2 slice combo to go and I got the exact 2 slice combo to go. In 2 min, my buddy's pizza was hot and ready in a box. Another 10 min go by, 2 other customers had ordered and I'm still waiting for my pizza. The guy at the counter pulls slices of pizza from the oven but walks past me and gives it to the 2 people who ordered after I did. I asked the guy, \"Where's my slices?\". He said, \"Did you order a combo too? I'll have those slices in 30 sec.\" Another 5 min go by and I see him about to walk to another customer when he makes eye contact w me, his eyes get big, runs to the oven to see my burnt black pizza. Him and his supervisor put another 2 slices in there, which they didn't tell me they did but I saw them. In another min they finally give me my pizza w only a \"Here's your pizza!\" There's no, \"Sorry for the wait.\", \"Sorry we burnt your pizza.\" Or \"Here's a free slice or coupon.\" Just a \"Here's your pizza!\"  I'm a service guy, if your food is awesome (which it wasn't), you still have to have decent service. I wish I wouldn't have gave that $1 tip on that receipt. Never coming back here again. BS"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious but obscenely expensive. They also refused to take my $50 bill, which is downright un-American."}
{"text":"Just ate here this past weekend and the pizza was great, especially the pizza that had layers of bacon, pepperoni, and some other type of meat."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but this pizza was so bad I had to , I see so many good reviews it makes me wonder if New York has good pizza at all , first off almost every pizza had pepperoni on it , second the pizza on display was cheese and was completely dried out , looked inedible , so I ordered sausage and I don't know what happened but I got a slice of cheese pizza with sausages sitting on top not melted or incorporated in the slice , 2 slices cost $10.40 or something close , I wanted something different so I went there , but you know what ... just go to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!  Wow, this is probably one of the worst customer service experiences I ever had. Cliffs are, I ordered a pizza last night, was supposed to be an hour delivery. An hour and a half later I call and ask where the pizza is, they say the delivery driver is on the way. One hour later, no pizza, I call the store and its closed.  So that was crappy enough, but today I called joe's new york pizza to talk to the manager about it. The owner is was there, the employee I was talking to on the phone relayed to me that \"since I was paying cash there's nothing to do.\" I said- \"yeah what about me waiting 2.5 hours for nothing and you failing to deliver?\" I asked to speak to the owner, apparently he was too busy.  I told the employee if he refused to talk to me I would just leave a negative review, and that I'd rather not to do that. The relayed to me that he didn't care. WOW!   The owner of this company DOES NOT CARE about their business. Truly I'm amazed, one of the worst customer service experiences I've seen-- and from an owner!"}
{"text":"I'll say that the food here is good,but... I went in late night last night and ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. Not anything gourmet and they weren't particularly large slices either. There was no per-slice price on the overhead menu, but, I didn't really think about it. When the employee rang me up it was close to $9.50 for the two slices!!! No free fountain drink or anything with it just two normal sized slices. I was pretty surprised and disappointed to say the least.  I would have expected to pay maybe $5 or so for what I got, however, I felt totally ripped-off paying for what I got. So word to the wise, make sure what the price is before you order because in my opinion it wasn't worth it!  WAY OVERPRICED AND NO PRICES LISTED PER-SLICE = FEELING RIPPED-OFF!"}
{"text":"Don't let these guys fool or intimidate you. They are posers. They are too cheap to purchase the true ingredients that New York pizzerias use. The delivery guy threw a fit because apparently I did not answer the door when he supposedly rang the bell. Never heard it but I did answer the phone the first time they called me and responded to the door immediately. A real New York pizza company? What a joke."}
{"text":"A little pricey for pizza but since it's on Las Vegas Blvd, you have to expect that.  The staff is always super nice and the pizza is to die for! They have a huge variety of different toppings and if you're buying by the slice, it varies on what's available because they have sooo much to offer.  The last couple of times I was in, they didn't have the white truffle pizza available by the slice, which is my favorite.  You can't go wrong with anything there, though. Ask for a side of sauce to dip your crust, it is a little bland by it's self but goes really well with the sauce."}
{"text":"Grabbed a slice for a quick bite, pizza was alright.  Word of advice go when your real hungry, it'll taste better and don't look at the pizza in the glass, just order, pay and sit down,  because the pizza in the glass looks kinda old and dry.   Don't expect great service unless you leave the gal a tip.  The lunch special runs $6.48 (2 slices of cheese pizza with a small soda)."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and so is the service.  They definitely got the New York style right. The big slices are perfect for folding!"}
{"text":"We stopped here almost by accident and I'm glad we did!  We stopped at the UPS store before heading back to the airport.  We thought maybe we should eat at this pizza place so we don't have to pay through the nose for airport lameness.  I ordered a pre-made slice of some pizza that had tomatoes on it, and I kept saying to myself, \"wow, surprisingly this is really good pizza\".  Everyone else at the table felt the same.  The atmosphere is clean and nice.  They have a TV playing sports and one of those fancy touch screen soda fountains.  The restroom was way nicer than similar restaurants and actually clean.  The employees were nice too.  We go to Vegas 2 or more times a year on business, and have our normal places to go... we are definitely adding Joe's to our list!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Hands down. Thin crust and not greasy. Their cheese steak sandwich is also great.  I ordered 15 extra large cheese pizza's double cut from them for my daughters birthday last year and everything went smoothly.  Everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"The claim of \"New York style thin crust pizza\" got me through the door. I did see three types of pre-made thin crust pizza slices among other quite fat bread slices. Rather than have a pre-made, not so fresh looking slice, I decided to build my own pizza. I requested thin crust, telling the lady taking my order that I was counting on their ad and their name, \"Joe's thin crust NY style pizza.\" After what seemed to be a long wait of 23 minutes, my 12\" pizza is served. Lo and behold, it is not thin crust, but fat bread. Yes, I was disappointed because NY style is not soggy bread. Still, the pizza bread was edible, enough for a 2-star passable rating. I'm sure I would not have entered this business if it weren't for the signage proclaiming \"NY style thin crust pizza.\" But, if you like more bread than crust in your pizza, then this place might be one you like."}
{"text":"Joe's pizza is absolutely delicious, especially the Manhattan loaded. The slices are big and they aren't shy on ingredients. Besides, it is a very comfortable place. We found it once we we in the neighborhood and we wanted something good, but not too heavy, and we were pleasantly surprised. I wholeheartedly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was just decent. I ordered the gigantic, which should just be called a large, and cost just shy of 25 bucks. I just got back from San Diego and the gigantic was a 54 in Sicilian for the same price.  I'm born and raised manhattan this pizza is blasphemy to the NYC tradition.   Qualifications: I eat a ton of pizza."}
{"text":"Joes New York Pizza was great the last time we ordered. The pizza was hot and fresh and tasted incredible. We had hoped that this time would be similar. Unfortunately, we called up for delivery and were told that it would be 45 minutes for a Grandma Pizza, garlic bread and a Caesar salad. The food was delivered after 1 hour and 45 minutes. We called them multiple times and were told that it would be \"just a few minutes\". Finally on the third call we asked for a refund and were told that they couldn't do refunds unless the manager was there. Apparently the ONLY manager was on vacation for a week. I have NEVER heard of any restaurant with only one person who has the ability to provide refunds. They did issue a credit for a free pizza. We were also told that even if they did do a refund it would be for the pizza only. Apparently they don't do complete refunds, which makes 0 sense. When the pizza did arrive, it was cold and the box was smashed. The garlic bread was bland and cold. The Caesar salad was soggy, and you could tell they had packaged it 45 minutes ago. This place has promise, but I will only give them one more shot before I write them off. I hope that their management reads this, and changes are enacted."}
{"text":"As always there perfect again and truly the best pizza in Las Vegas. I make sure to get here as often as possible because I'm always 100% satisfied. Thanks for being nearby me."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time ....the pizza was old just sitting there ....they warm it and box it ...two slices 13  bucks the cashier wad rude and fat and ugly and kept pulling up her pants....zero stars besides its open late...seems like all the good reviews are fakes dig deeper and see the truth is they have uglier then normal rude people working ...High prices and old burned pizza"}
{"text":"I go here about once a month because i live right around the corner and it's open super late.  The food is over priced and bland but gets the job done.  Convenient for late night parties walking over from the Hard Rock.  My last trip here sealed the deal that I'd rather pop in a microwave meal and call it a night than eat at Joe's NY Pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza here is great when you eat in... delivery is a different story. Always very friendly and food is priced well, possibly best pizza in Vegas! On the downside of delivery, the pizza always seems to come out soggy. I'm not sure why but this has been the case for me all of the times I've ordered for delivery."}
{"text":"These people were jerks. After I ordered and gave them my card I said \"Wow, it takes fucking 10 mins to place an order.\" Not in hateful way. Just stating the obvious and yes I cuss. The guy said, sorry I will not deliver to you and hung up on me. I called back and they continued to hang up on me! I asked go speak to manager and they just hung up. This is bull shit and the worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Wow pizza was good didn't expect this in Sin city....pesto and lasagna pizza was great.. P.s the service is even better than the food Great people and great food what else can you ask for after vegas took all your money..."}
{"text":"Late night at the strip and was looking for a place to go with two kids.  They asked for pizza and it was one block from our hotel.  LARGE pieces of pizza in the showcase.  My son and I got the meat special, wife had the feta and spinach and daughter had pepperoni.  Took it back to warm it up and it was out fast.    I see that someone said the crust was burnt, but I found it just enough to be crispy on the ends.  Not greasy and plenty of toppings.  Tomato sauce was to everyone's liking, but I still added some extra cheese at the counter.  If this is any testament as to whether it was good or not, two sets of police officers walked in for a late night bite.  Follow the cops if you want a good pie.  I would go back when I am in town."}
{"text":"fast delivery to our hotel and the pizza is delicious! only reason i took off a star is because of how much i paid, which is inevitable considering everything is more expensive in LV, haha."}
{"text":"I should have stuck to my gut feeling and ordered pizza.  But...no, I decided why not see how their other food is. Bad idea.  We orderd: Philly Cheesesteak Calzone Garlic Knots French Fries  My cheese steak was practically empty. There was about 80% bread going on here. I had to add some of my own to make it more tasty! What little meat there was, wasn't horrible. The french fries were sad - I mean SAD. They were wet and limp with no flavor at all. The texture was just weird. The calzone was made with Mozzarella, Ricotta, onions, peppers and sausage...this could have been good if the dough was cooked more and it wasn't drowning in ricotta cheese.  The only think I truly enjoyed was the garlic knots. They were fantastic! Little pieces of garlic heaven. If you do not LOVE garlic I would stay away from these little buddies as they are covered in it. Yum!  Previously, we've eaten here late night and had delicious pizza. IF I ever return I will stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"Just from the taste of their Hungarian pizza, I give this place a 4 star. I was still a little full when I got home from a disappointing meal from the outlets and I already knew that I needed a back up meal after getting my gyro. So I went to a to this place which was really close by. I like chicken pizza and they had a unique one. The main components were something they called chicken paprikas, which I think is something they marinated and seasoned with, dollops of cream through out the pizza and I think little tiny amounts of mushroom? That's my guess...I believe that they left the sauce out on purpose because of the toppings but it worked out really well, just like other sauce less pizzas that I've had, surprisingly. Like I said I didn't eat it right away, so it was slightly below warm and although the mozzarella wasn't oohwy gooey anymore, it was still really good! Now that's a sign of a good pizza. Next time I have make it a point to at least take a bite while the pizza is still warm, to be able to know to know the difference and enjoy the experience.  The guy at front took my name, but ended up bringing it to my table instead and with plates already with it. Usually I have to ask these places for them. But he didn't have parmesan, peppers or napkins. Other than that I highly recommend this place and will be sure to try out their other offerings."}
{"text":"It's pretty bad. Even as a late night option...  This was way too expensive for the quality of the food. The pizza was barely okay."}
{"text":"When I want to indulge, I order Joes! I seriously love the pizza, garlic knots, and fried zeppoles! One of my favorite pizza spots in Vegas. The employees are not too shabby as well."}
{"text":"The pizza's we ordered were outstanding. They delivered to the hot and were piping hot. Was not disaapointed in any way."}
{"text":"Used this local pizza place for delivery to our hotel.  The delivery was made within the time frame promised.  The quality of the food was good and the portions were generous in size.  The delivered right to our hotel door so we didn't have to go down late to the lobby.    The price was fair for what we ordered (3 stromboli, wings and cheese sticks).  Delivery person was professional and courteous.  If/when we are in Phoenix again and need pizza delivery in the Scottsdale area I would consider using them again."}
{"text":"Meh... Average pizza to me. Ordered a slice of cheese, and nothing special could have went to sbarros for the same thing. Can't say anything about the other food items but I would expect the same quality.   Staff was somewhat welcoming, after our order was completed they all huddled to the back and conversed amongst each other. Gentleman who served me warned me that the pizza was hot, but it was barely warm.   Drink prices are outrageous for the sizes, and the tea machine didn't even function. Just poured water out. Also, there are no prices posted of anything, besides the drinks.    All in all, the likely hood of me eating here would be either it's the only place open at the time, someone else is buying, or I'm drunk and any pizza sounds good."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome. Service is not as awesome. The last time I was there the lady at the cashier was very rude. This place needs friendlier ppl working there."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place. We got the meat pie. Sooo good, loaded with meat and so tasty. Love the humongousaurus size. I think it weighs 20 lbs."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I had two different pizzas. One was the Manhattan. I can't recall what the other pizza was. I came here after shopping at the Las Vegas outlet. The employees were nice. The decor is interesting and fitting. The pasta servings is enough to feed at least two people. Might be much for one average person. Wait time for our food was a reasonable five minutes for the pizza since they just needed to reheat it. The pizza took about 15 minutes to make."}
{"text":"Joe's New York Pizza its an awesome place!!! Every time I've gone there for a slice or a full pie, it's been a great experience! The staff has always been very welcoming, friendly and helpful with the menu choices!  Keep it up Joe's New York Pizza, you have a loyal costumer for as long as I eat  !!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm an avid user of Delivered Dish, and I love the company. They recently added \"Joe's NY Pizza\" to their list plus a free delivery coupon so I said why not. Ordered a 12\" half cheese, have pep pizza plus the baked potato fries. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either.. It was.. Okay, plain, ordinary. Plus it was $13.xx for a 12\"? That's ridiculous. I actually would prefer the traditional fast food pizza chains (Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns) than this.. The dough tasted very \"yeasty\" if that's even a word. There was little sauce and little cheese, but a lot of bread. Actually now that I think of it, it almost tastes like frozen pizza like Digiorno or something. The baked potato fries were okay, but the fries were extremely soggy. Only positive thing is that they put a crap load of bacon!"}
{"text":"Joe's pizza is my go to spot whenever I come to Vegas pizza is excellent and the customer service is  as well"}
{"text":"ORDER DOMINOS PIZZA!!!!! Owner is a east coast douche with no customer service skills whatsoever. It took over a hour to deliver a pepperoni pizza. When I told him I was disappointed in the delivery time, he tried to lie. This business will fail soon and go belly up. I wish I could put a negative star."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to get real pizza & the Sicilian pizza is to die for.  What's missing? Real N.Y. Italian Ices & I don't mean gelato!,,,,,"}
{"text":"There is a good variety and the pizza is really tasty! Great service! I ordered 1 slice, but next time I'm definitely getting a whole pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza slices. We just came to Vegas and headed here to grab a bite. Highly recommended if you want to checkout some new york style pizzas."}
{"text":"Sorry but worst pizza ever I was starving and couldn't eat this pizza  Never again $25 bucks for the Sicilian pizza not worth it just go to little cesar's  Dough was bad everything else no flavor at all. Wish I can refund my pizza"}
{"text":"I only got as far as the phone call for delivery. I talked to 4 people just trying to place  a delivery order over the phone. Everyone was very rude with me. I guess you could say it was authentic with the New York Style. I asked for the minimum price on a late night delivery, and minimum distance from restaurant. Sorry if that's too much for you to take on. Obviously McDonald's holds a higher standard for late night dining. I manage a restaurant . Minimum orders suck, but so do minimum restaurant sales. You never know who will over tip when no one else is open."}
{"text":"The service here was above and beyond my expectations. I like how you can order by the slice and it is not that expensive. The pizza here has a unique taste which is satisfying. I will be returning here more often!"}
{"text":"Bamn!! Pizza for lunch is a weekly thing for me. Quick service. Staff is always smiling. For the record, Kris H. is the 2nd best cashier in the place :)  Love her personality!!!!"}
{"text":"$18 for a cheese pizza is a bit much for me. It wasn't even that good. The crust was thin, which isn't NY style pizza. Lastly, the people working were very rude. I wont go again."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas many times and always stop at Joe's. Hungarian chicken pizza is awesome. So creamy. Service is always top notch. Thanks Joe's."}
{"text":"The best place for a good pizza near the strip. I highly recommend having the gourmet pepperoni, meat pie and Joe's special. Those are my go to pizzas when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"7:10pm 11/28. First time here. Worker seem busy and rush me through my order. I explained it was my first time, and he didn't seem to care. A bit pricy for a sliced of pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome lil pizza place right across the street from Hard Rock hotel. Solid pizza. Had the meat lovers which the cheese is melted on top of the toppings. $13 bucks for 2 slices & a bottled soda. Slices are larger than normal places so you get your monies worth.  Open pretty late for it being off the strip, til 4am on most days. Seating is limited. Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating, I would. I'm a reasonable man, but the what this place did to us was (up to this point) unbelievable. My girlfriend ordered $50's of food online. I called to add a 2 liter of coke, waited 20 minutes on hold, then had someone pickup the phone and hung up. We called back to confirm that the original order was placed and add the coke, but whoever answered the phone informed me that he was cancelling the order. I clearly reiterated that I had no intention of cancelling the order, I just needed to confirm that it was being made, and to order a 2 Liter. I was told \"The order has been cancelled,\" and I was HUNG UP ON. My girlfriend talked to Jose the Superviser, and he assured her that the food was actually ready at the time the order was canceled (???) And that the order would be delivered as soon as possible... we are only 1 mile away, so 15 minutes later we called to see the status, and they told us the order was cancelled AGAIN. If they were busy, I can wait extra time for a pizza, no problem. But what happened tonight was unnacceptable to a mindboggling level. I'm going to take time out of my vacation to go back during the day to speak to a manager during the day (and no I'm not asking for free stuff). It was honestly THAT level bad. Please avoid ordering pizza from here."}
{"text":"It was my last night and Vegas and I couldn't leave without getting pizza. We were on our way back from strip and had seen this along the road several times so thought we pass and order a pie.  It's not a large establishment but enough room for some seating.  I ordered the fried mac & cheese and small grandma pie.  I'll admit both hit the spot. The fried mac and cheese had the right combination of crispy exterior and gooey cheesy interior. For the pizza the bread was soft, thin and well done just how I like it. The sauce also had a good flavor. I devoured my half of the pizza very quickly. If in Vegas I do recommend."}
{"text":"This is small quaint place that sells pizza by the slice or the whole pie if you wish.   This is a 1000 times better than Sabarro's but nothing to write home about either.  If you want something quick and cheap, this is a great place.   If you are waiting for someone to arrive at the airport this is also a great pit stop."}
{"text":"These guys know pizza. There are a few pizza options in Old Town but I would walk out of my way to go here. It's your standard fold in half and drip the grease into your mouth pizza, but that's exactly what I went when I come here and they always come through.   Great for a quick lunch if your work in the area. Also it's another great end of the night meal if your at the bars/clubs in Old Town, there is usually a lot of people when the clubs close but guys it gives you one last shot to spit game when you failed all night on the dance floor."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick great piece of pizza or a bowl of pasta. I also like their salads, and my husband likes the meatball panini. I like how the pizzas are always fresh and there is a good selection. The pepperoni pizza with the goat cheese is my favorite!  The staff is friendly and quick. I especially like to mention that the restaurant is clean, and all the tables were clean and ready to sit down and eat. I have seen many smaller pizza places or other smaller restaurants where the floors are dirty etc. It's always clean here at Joe's. Big compliment to the staff!"}
{"text":"I got screwed.  I pointed out the error, when I was picking up my pizza:  I had ordered BANANA peppers; not peperoncini.  SOB at the counter, walked away, then lied to me; saying that he got it wrong, that is was really banana peps.  I should've gone to Papa John's.  What \"shits\"...."}
{"text":"Terrible! Will never order pizza here again. I usually order pizza to go for the family. Tonight it was like eating cardboard. I called them to tell them and basically"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery at 6:30pm. Was told it would be about an hour. It is now 9:48pm and I have NOT gotten my order. I called 3x to check on status of the order and was told it was on its way...apparently not. The manager told me he was going to call the delivery guy and see where he was. Yeah, that was at 9:00. Good thing my 5 year old had leftovers from dinner the night before.  I'd give it a zero just for service alone since I have no idea what the pizza tastes like."}
{"text":"I do love there pizza! Everyone makes mistakes atleast they do make it right with a timley fashion!"}
{"text":"The pizza was OK. Middle of the road for New York pizza"}
{"text":"Dont Bother ordering from here! I wish I could give this pizza join negative stars. I would talk about the food but it never was delivered. I placed my order and waited. 1 hour and 30 mins go by so I call just to double check, I get told by the guy who answered the phone \"O, the delivery guy already left he will be there shortly.\" Alright cool, I only live 10 mins away. 30 more mins go by. I call back. Same guy answers the phone and recedes to tell me. \"O, yeah we never got your order I just checked out Grubhub. Sorry.\"  I call Grubhub as I have already been charged and want to know what I can do to just get my pizza. Grubhub calls. They tell grubhub that O now their internet had been down for 2 hours.  I can understand mistakes happen but dont sit there and lie to the customer who is Just Trying To Eat some pizza! Disgraceful that they cant even admit they were wrong and just try and fix the problem. Please dont waste your money at this poor excuse of an establishment."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza place!  It is on my to-do list every time I come to Vegas and it never disappoints!  Not only is the pizza absolutely amazing the staff is also always very friendly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gag Worthy food and facilities; Sketchy business practices!    This place deserves 0 stars. I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and ordered a slice of cheese pizza.  It was dripping with so much grease that even 5 napkins would not sop it up. I returned the entire slice uneaten and requested my money back. The guy at the register refused and told me to come back at night and ask for Pete.    I returned later and the female \"Manager\" told me Pete wasn't there and they don't give refunds.  After ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized I wasn't going away so she called Pete on the phone. He said he would have to mail me a check  for the purchase price of the slice. Uh, the slice was $3 and, as you probably guessed, I never received the check.   In addition to the gross food, I made the mistake of entering the restroom and the stench of urine and fllth almost knocked me unconscious! Avoid this place under all circumstances!!"}
{"text":"I was really hungry until I started eating the chicken tenders and mac n cheese bites I ordered. Very bummed my hotel recommended this place."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state and we stopped in, enjoyed the food & great service! Thank you for the experience!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, perfect style. Crust was awesome. The driver/delivery guy was pleasant and kind  I just moved from California and very much enjoyed the food and experience. Thanks"}
{"text":"It's not what I expected my Greek salad and slice of cheese pizza with a small drink at $16.75 claims to be madness on freshness! But I certainly didn't taste the freshness of my salad or the pizza itself. Give it 3 stars only because it rivals Pizza Hut , papa John's Gino's pizza."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the area just looking for a quick bite...great pizza!!!! The spinach and tomato is vey fresh. And best part, they were playing blink 182 and taking back Sunday"}
{"text":"I ordered the Veggie special. It was horrible. The veggies were not that fresh. My family ordered the meat pizzas. The meat was very scarce. All the pizzas had no flavor. I gave 2 stars because Mike the deliver man was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Vegas hands down. Love the wings, pizza etc . I wish more people knew about this place. Price point not bad but the food is great"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza in the state!  Hands down! I am originally from New York and I have not found good pizza until I came here.  Even when my friends come with me.  They too agree that the pizza is fantastic.  This includes my friends that visit me from New York.  If you are looking for some good pizza, check out Joe's in Oldtown.  Glen"}
{"text":"The pizza was good but not great. The slice was large for a $4.61 slice.  I did ask the cashier to heat my slice an extra minute to make sure it was hot.  Glad this place was open at 4am when I was having a case of the munchies.  Look forward to eating here agian and trying out there other menu items."}
{"text":"After waiting 1.5 hrs we called to check on our order. They hadn't even made it yet! I asked if they would be delivering it for free and they offered a %25 discount. Cancelled order."}
{"text":"Best pizza by the slice in Vegas. without a doubt. i go to both the paradise road and LV BLVD locations. Can't go wrong with either."}
{"text":"We had mild wings today atmosphere is clean and good hospitality by the workers  We will come again."}
{"text":"Every time we come out to Vegas we have to make a trip to this Pizza place. My mouth waters for this place!"}
{"text":"where is the love? something was missing with my last visit to Joe's New York Pizza.......where is Joe?!?! i admit it has been at least a year since i have been in there last.( i got hooked on the other side of the street with best of Italy pizza) i couldn't get enough people to agree on one type of pie so i got a few slices.  They were big slices and the crust was thin, they might have had a chance if they were not \"marinating\" in the window for an hour.  i like to load up on parm and crushed red pepper after I'm through with condiments it all tastes the same but nothing i can do can hide far from fresh product.  if you find yourself on that side of town and need late night food check out Best of italy or Philly Sandwich(24hrs!!!wtf) on 5th ave and scottsdale"}
{"text":"This place has decent pizza but it is REALLY greasy.  I always have to dab the grease off before I eat it.  I order cheese most of the time, I ordered onion and green peppers once and the pizza came... It looked like an onion festival was underway... I could see a few green peppers and barely any cheese due to the enormous amount of onions piled up.  I was not happy.  I called next time and asked if they could do a third of the normal toppings, told the lady on the phone my onion story to explain, she proceeded to laugh at me and say \"That was me! I looovvvveee onions! Hahaha!\" Really?? She didn't even offer to give me a free topping or anything.  It was odd.  Other than that for delivery they are very fast, and stay open the latest in the area.  The chocolate cake is disappointing.  It is that same frozen layer cake I used to thaw out when I was a server at a spot in college.  I usually order it and microwave it for a bit then eat it, much better that way!  Really if this place used better quality ingredients and fresh vs. frozen items they would be 5 star....  Don't order the cheese sticks, they are not pizza style, they are fried mozzarella and gross by the time you get them.  Hell, those things are only good fresh out of the frier anyway...go with the garlic bread, it's solid."}
{"text":"They delivered to me at 2 am on a week night. Awesome! When I ordered, all the big pizza chains had stopped delivering. I love the traditional garlic bread with cheese. Much better than cheese sticks by a long shot. I really liked the cheese blend on the thin crust pizza. Closest taste to Imo's Pizza (St. Louis style) since I moved out West."}
{"text":"I just happened to be in the area walking back from the double down. I live in the Bay area and am from the East Coast. This was hands down the best pizza i have had and for the price it was even better. I will never tell anyone. I will get pizza every time i am in Vegas from now on even if it is down by the Hard Rock. I was tempted to get more while watching the games at the Hard Rock on Sunday. The Bar Tender agreed with me that it is the best pizza he has had so i guess it was not just me. Everyone else who disagrees just doesn't know good pizza."}
{"text":"They were amazing! We were there, from Phoenix, this past weekend for a soccer tournament, and this is where the team took the kids. The food was great and the service was good. I would recommend this place if you're in town."}
{"text":"$15 for 3 slices and a large soda.  Mediocre pizza. Soda was good.  Service was fine. You decide if it's right for you.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza for delivery and it took over an hour and a half to get it. And we we called to check on it they hung up on me. This place needs some Customer service training, and management needs to talk with their night staff because they were really rude. Will not be ordering from this pizza place again."}
{"text":"When the Husband and I meet for lunch this is hands down my favorite place to go. I have never been disappointed in our selections and the service is fast and friendly. The pizza by the slice is affordable, huge and tasty!! They have great hot wings and they are not the little wimpy ones a lot of places sell. The calzones are huge and enough for 2 people, if you are in a rush you may want to order ahead as  they take 25 mins to bake. They have  a punch card so every time you order a slice after so many you get a free slice, and what is better than free pizza???"}
{"text":"Good pizza. New York style just a slice if you want or a whole pie. Been here alot of times and always good service and good food."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery, accurate order, and very good food. Their pizzas are excellent, and their Salads are very good (and very large.....they can feed two or three)."}
{"text":"Pizza is great if you eat in the restaurant. Their delivery could be the worst in town. Always over an hr and most times 90 minutes. By the time the food arrives it's horrible."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! I am a big fan and will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza. Very warm welcoming environment. Emilio and Anna are awesome. Just make sure your very hungry. The slices are huge and the flavors are insane!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery took an hour and a half when ordered at 6:40p on Friday evening. The food was a huge disappointment for the wait and price. We ordered a pizza with half cheese half sausage. They put sausage on the whole pizza. The garlic knots we ordered were terrible and had no taste. I will never order food from here again."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time a few years ago. I stopped by last night and was disappointed.   Ordered a simple pepperoni pizza to go. Patiently waited. Then they bring it out as if I was eating it there. I told them it was a to go order. They were not happy and threw the pizza in a box dislodging the cheese from the crust.  Got home, pizza was undercooked. Pepperoni was raw. Dough was not cooked.   I hate to say it, but a $4 frozen pizza cooked in my oven for 15mins is 100 times better then the raw pizza I got last night."}
{"text":"I'm a NY'er and long time Joe's fan as it is the only place in town with a decent slice.  I must say that lately the quality has been declining.  Not enough sauce on the pies, bad tomatoes in the salad and even some bad entrees lately.  I just hope that someone over there reads these reviews and gets things back to how they used to be as this place has great potential."}
{"text":"Great for late night delivery.  We were lucky to find this place that delivered to our hotel (Jockey Club). When we ordered the man who answered was nice (Jose) and helped me select something yummy. We had to the delivery guy in the lobby but he was very nice and energetic when her arrived.  It's nice to see a place that doesn't make you feel like your unconvincing them by ordering late at night.  Was told delivery time would be 45 min and our food arrives right on time.    Pizza it's self was lil salty but still well worth the 5 star rating. We have tried other pizza places in the area and by far this is the best one.    Happy Eating people."}
{"text":"Just received delivery this evening. Delivery was prompt, pizza hot and good and no problem with delivery person at all.  Ordered on line."}
{"text":"I recommend not going at night because the pizza won't be as fresh. I felt like I was a bit rushed since it was close to closing time. There is a good variety of pizzas at a decent price. It isn't too far from the strip, so if you're looking to safe money, this place isn't a bad idea."}
{"text":"I use to live in new York city for 7 years and Iam always looking for great tasting pizza in Arizona. This pizza place was recommended to me. Being a pizza critic I was a lil disappointed on our first visit. The next day my boyfriend called and spoke to the manager. Lisa was the nicest person she invited us back for a better experience and enjoy better tasting free on the house pizza. I guess it turns out the guy making pizza the night before purposely made crappy slices because it last night working there and the owner was out. The next visit we had much better tasting pizza we enjoyed 2 regular cheese slices and 2 Sicilian slices with free drinks, this was definitely better than the 1st visit. I would say its close to new york tasting pizza but the sauce still needs more salt or flavors and maybe olive oil or butter on the dough. With that it would be perfect!  Well thank you to the owner she made us very happy and we will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great pizza , big slices got 2 pieces for 9 bucks buffalo chicken and cheese pizza and it's right across the street from my room at the hard rock . Pizza is the best food late night when you've been drinking all day"}
{"text":"Came in this afternoon 11/23 for the 4:20 rush ,first time visit .  It's a very clean good flow restaurant big community tables down the middle 6 people can sit at each one . Down the left side of the restaurant when walking in is half booth half chair tables 4 tops. An on the right side is 4 person full booths . Very simple calm color tones . Vintage posters on the walls .   You order at a open counter kitchen a women with a paw on her breast took my order . They have a ton of stuff on the menu . Very big menu ! But they have 3 big lcd tv's displaying there menu. I got a grilled chicken pesto panini , very good for them being a pizza place. Had a lot of great Italian flavor. The price per slice of pizza was rather high starting at $6 an all the way up to 11$ is kinda high. But the woman who served me was very nice an straight to the point.  I love that they have. A coca - cola freestyle machine!   They have a slice club as well buy 9 an get the 10th free . Also if you post s review on Yelp you get a free slice of pizza of your choice  Overall good visit very clean and tidy restaurant I like that they have a open kitchen ."}
{"text":"DO NOT believe their website. Just ordered delivery from here. The order was not right, called to see if they would fix it, got the third degree about what we ordered, then heard the manager in the background claiming the deal we got did not exist. We were not concerned about money, or the \"deal\"  just wanted to get what we thought we paid for! Obviously customer service is not the priority and they are only concerned about the bottom line. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Oh boy! This one hurts me to write. I really enjoy the food from Joe's. The pizza is one of my favorites in Las Vegas. However, I will never eat there or order from there again. This is a customer service review, or lack there of. I was thinking of the best way to take in this golden knights Stanley cup playoff game. I couldn't think of any thing other to eat than my favorite pizza, Joe's. The only problem is they don't deliver to my neck of the woods. But thank god for grub hub. I ordered my dinner from them at 6:26pm and my pizza eta was 7:10-7:25, not too bad. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the clock strikes 8:00 and I'm hungrier than Rosie O'Donnell after 10mins on the stair master. So I give Joe's a call just to make sure everything is on the up and up. Well thats where my story sadly takes a turn for the worst. A young lady by the name of Sara (who turns out to be the manager) with a snarky attitude informs me that they were \"VERY BUSY, and received in TWO whole orders at the same time\" and then went on to say \"well yeah we didn't check our tablet, did you want us to cancel your order? Next time you can call us to order it for delivery\" I say \"well I'm sorry but I ordered on grub hub because you don't deliver to my house\" \"YES WE DO. MY delivery driver would've taken the order to you\" so I ask \"your driver works for grub hub?\" \"Well no but they deliver\" So I say \"yes please cancel my order\" then I pause and say \"I love the food here and I'm just disappointed with your customer service, I unfortunately won't be back here.\" She then goes to say \"well I told you to order over the phone next time. I would say that I could comp your next meal but you said the you're never coming back so no use in offering that to you now, is there?!\" Wow just wow. Sad and hungry is where I am now. I feel like I'm wasting away faster than ***Spoiler Alert*** Spiderman at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars. \"Mr. Yelp, I don't feel so good.......\""}
{"text":"What a great gem amongst many choices in LV. The white pizza was so good! I've never had ricotta cheese on a pizza before YUM! The service here was amazing, super friendly and they delivered to our hotel!!!"}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite pizza spot, sober or not. The closest pizza to authentic NY pizza.... And they deliver! A plus!"}
{"text":"I'm from the East. This pizza is dry and tasteless, cheese taste is low quality. The dough tastes like bisquick base to cut cost. Sauce is watered down. What really floors me..... is they have the Gaul to ask for $3.50 a slice and it is no bigger than a slice of dominoes pizza maybe even smaller, you legit need 3 Slices to make 1 real slice. This place used to be good back 4-5 yrs ago, but they now are doing the public a disservice with a very poor quality product for a premium price. They should just close their doors. How do they sleep at night stealing from their customers. Please just go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Was hungry wanted a quick bite thought it looked ok on yelp. .regular slice was ok..the Sicilian was on point. I'm from Jersey and the dough was right....and that's the hardest part....light tasty  and good"}
{"text":"Looking for a great pizza place with more than just pizza? This is the place to go. A short walk from the Hard Rock Hotel. Very well priced, also Not only is the food excellent but the staff is outstanding.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I agree with the first poster that this might be the best pizza I've had in Vegas.  I have not ordered a full pie but I have been to Joe's lots of times for a quick lunch before heading off to work the night shift.  The bare bones staff is very friendly and you can tell they are good people.  At the counter you'll find a few different pizzas on display for slices.  They'll pop it in the oven for a minute and you're good to go.  Inside there are a few HD televisions on the wall, with at least one on ESPN at all times.  If you know anything about the economy, you know that food prices has shot through the roof, especially for those who make and sell pizza.  Thus, prices have gone up on my pizza slice over the past year.  It's about 5 bucks for a slice and bottle of water (don't quote me on that) but it's totally worth it.  Looking forward to my next lunch there.  I only with it wasn't next to the Tropical Smoothie Cafe because it's like being torn in two trying to make that decision."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is AMAZING! not only does it have the most unique pizzas -- but they have the best CRUST ever! They have pizzas that will just blow your socks off!! Escargot pizza anybody??? Who on this planet would put escargot on a pizza!!!! Joe's NY Pizza. This place is a family own business and Peter is the owner! Him and his family are ALWAY so welcoming!   Get a taste of a slice of heaven at Joe's... I can't say enough how great this place is!!!! I'm not sure if this is \"New York\"  style pizza... but the sauces, wings, and salads are my favorite!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see New York style... But was very disappointed with what actually arrived. For some reason pizza seems like the easiest thing in the world to make but these guys missed the mark on most everything. It arrives in a giant square, the crust is like a massive piece of tasteless focaccia bread. Sauce tasted like watered down Campbell's soup...no seasoning that I could detect whatsoever.  We basically ended up eating the cheese off of it. The good thing is that it will feed a family of six no worries because it weighs about 50 pounds. It was cool to be able to order right off yelp, and they came exactly when they said they would.  That's why I have them 2 stars."}
{"text":"I was really blown away by how bad this pizza experience was... It was room temp and basically a bucket of grease. Wow."}
{"text":"I'm giving Joe's four stars but that may be a bit a generous. I just feel like three is a little low but my experience was more like a 3.5. Allow me to explain.  My boyfriend and I stopped by Joe's with our friends after going to the nearby bar. We picked up a slice of cheese and a slice of margherita pizza to go. Everything seemed fine until we got home and looked more closely at the margherita pizza. We're pretty sure that instead of basil, it had spinach on it. I've never had a margherita pizza with spinach instead of basil so we're wondering if it was a mistake. I suppose the two green leaves look somewhat similar. And I'm assuming it was supposed to be margherita pizza. That's what we ordered and no one corrected us.  Aside from that misstep, everything else was good. The cheese pizza was delicious, especially topped with a bit of parmesan cheese and garlic. If only we had only gotten the cheese, this may have been a five star stop."}
{"text":"I used to work super close to this Joe's location, and I LOVED the pizza. It was fabulous. I never had a bad slice, and I found myself wanting to eat here every day for lunch (I didn't, though...phew!).  When they hired this dumb girl I went to highschool with I noticed a change in customer service and quality of food. I think she just confused everyone.  The best pizza I've had in Vegas so far. If Napoli's wasn't so greasy their sausage & pepperoni pizza would be up there as well. For now, Joe's wins."}
{"text":"I would have given their pizza 4 stars, but is was delivered WAY UNDER-COOKED. Why are they in such a hurry?! The pizza by the slice in the store is never undercooked."}
{"text":"I give it a great 4/5 stars because they really care about their customers. If you're a usual then they'll always give you extra garlic rolls and other stuff especially if you're splitting an order like the spaghetti with meatballs because those portions are pretty big. Would definitely recommend coming here. The pizza is also great by I love the meatballs. Employees are always super nice too so that really helps a lot!"}
{"text":"Ordered Caprese Panini as the Hawaiian pizza wasn't available.  I like it!...I always have the pizza here, my first time to order the panini."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pizza slices. I am also a big fan of their Italian combo as well as their tuna fish sandwich. Pretty much everything on the menu has been outstanding. And the ranch is to die for. Oh and don't let me forget to mention about the cheesecake. One of the best cheesecake that I've ever had. The staff is friendly and at night they try to get you in and out and be as friendly as possible but sometimes things get a little crazy but hey they are feeding the drunk people. Who can ask for anything better fresh ingredients friendly service and free entertainment. Thank you Joeskeep up the good work."}
{"text":"We tried their combo pizza and got a side order of chicken wings. Free delivery took about almost an hour, besides that they delivered to our hotel, food was good and hot. The crust was so soft. I liked that they gave us plates, napkins, etc... without me asking for it. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Lotta hype how good there pies are in there t.v. Commercials, But we ate there tonight and it was just ok. Had the Hungarian chicken and Joe's favorite. They were a bit flimsy in the crust and not very crispy. Chicken paprikash tasted nothing like what grandma used to make.  Oh well maybe next time maybe not."}
{"text":"Wow this pizza is really good!!! It seems to get better and better with every new pizza I try. The employees are always really nice and if i could i would eat here everyday.   Keep doing what your doing causes its workin!!!"}
{"text":"I am a native new yorker..so i guess i'm biased. the pizza dough was ok..if you like your dough - dougie. the sauce was good... marinara... but the cheese seemed processed..like the cheese lil caesars may use. tip: use real mozzarella.. other than that.. i was happy to see the oil span emitting from the pie...."}
{"text":"Everytime im in vegas, this is my favorite place to go to for pizza. Im always tempted to get the meat pie, but always experiment with other things. Looking forward to the next time im here!"}
{"text":"Don't disrespect your taste buds by eating at a chain subpar pizza place again.  They deliver, great quality, reasonable prices.  Unexpectedly Delicious, serioulsy."}
{"text":"I was sober when I ordered and ate this pizza. It seems like I might be in the minority of their customer base here.  I called up to order delivery and they were super nice. I ordered a small pie & a Caesar salad. Clogged arteries anyone? The nice chic on the phone finished taking my order and told me the pizza would be here in 45 minutes. Then it arrived in only 30 minutes! Thank you!  The pizza was decent. It was a little too greasy, and the crust was a little too thick for me, but it did the job. The Caesar was good, nothing special, but good.   I wouldn't eat here all the time, but if you need some decent pizza to soak up the alcohol in your system this is probably the going to do the trick."}
{"text":"My family and I came here because it was close to the Silverton where we were staying and right next to the outlets. The staff was friendly and the pizza was awesome. Thin, crispy and the slice was huge. We will definitely be back next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was never delivered. They never called me back when  they canceled my order. Very disappointed. They make excellent pizza. Only carry out from now on."}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza.  Cool that you can order by the slice!  We ate in.  Even though they reheat the slices it had a great crust and temperature was spot on.  We also ordered a whole pizza and the garlic cheesesticks were great!!"}
{"text":"Very particular about my pizza. Today was my first visit. The people are friendly, and down to earth. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. Most importantly the food was excellent. My wife got the meatball sub. She lived it. I got a couple of slices of pizza and some wings. The wings are meaty, and cooked perfectly. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Give it up for the pizza on the Horseshoe! It is a battle between Joe's and Gus'. Both good in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ordered one slice of cheese pizza and 10 piece wings with sauce on the side. I ask for sauce on the side because it makes the chicken soggy and SALTY. And of course it was not, they said oh \"I know you asked for sauce on the side, but it's not.. Did you want us to remake it ? \" of course I said no, because I'm too nice. But sure enough .. It wasn't to my liking. The pizza was dripping with grease, and it was pretty pricey. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Dont order on the weekends and expect it to be flawless. I ordered at 12:00am, called at 2am to see where it is. I got put on hold and they left the line open so you could hear the mayhem that is their dining area. Woman shouting about where the hell her wings are and other customers asking for help and service with no response. I was left like that for 10 minutes. I put it on speaker at the party i was hosting so everyone there could laugh at the ridiculousness that was happening on the other end. Outrageous from a professional stand point and need strong leadership on the weekends to keep it a solid business"}
{"text":"There are only so many places you can get great delivery food in Scottsdale. This is one. For what it is it- this is great pizza and wings.  Fast service. Did I mention delivery!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas! Best all you can eat deal in town! My clients love it too. Bought $100 worth of food today and it saved me over $1500 in overtime labor charges.  I'm definitely a repeat customer, and I highly recommend this place to Las Vegas tourists as well as locals!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 2013 Award Winning Pepperoni Pizza!  loved it! I ordered online. Joe's called immediately after to verify our order and delivery location.  Delivery Service was faster than they predicted. They give u the option to add on a tip at the time of pick up. tips ranged from 5,6, and 8 dollars.   We ordered the small pizza and we had pizza left over for the next afternoon. We also ordered the Nutty Italian Salad. It fed both us!"}
{"text":"We went for pizza but ended up with more...beer battered mushrooms, salad and cheesy garlic sticks. The food was wonderful however food can only taste so good depending on the service, in my opinion.....and it lacked good service. The girl who took our order couldn't explain what beer battered mushrooms were and I myself wasn't sure although I believed it to be fried mushrooms. Which they were. We also got our pizza before our \"starters\" which makes no dang sense to me whatsoever. All in all, I'd go back for the food but wouldn't dine in. Another upside is the decor of the restaurant is unique and very different. Definitely not what you'd expect."}
{"text":"this place is creepy.  there was a cop standing around patrolling all the pizza eaters last Saturday.  what kind of restaurant has police officers parading around to intimidate its patrons?  Hire private security like every other establishment.  Seriously a cop at 2 in the morning at a pizza place on a Saturday.  No thanks."}
{"text":"2nd time is not a charm!  The pizza is good but service isnt very friendly and ordered some garlic knots and they were not cooked, doughy inside  :(       Well...The speghetti and pizza is what I would return for as its delicious or at least it was last time...  They also have an all you can eat pizza special from 2pm to 5pm, $9.99 so that sounds like a good deal."}
{"text":"Joe's pizza was exceptional! I got the Frat Boy, which I thought was going to be a bunch of meat, but it turns out it was an amazing medley of veggies and cheese. The crust was cooked to perfection and he slices were huge. I also ordered the Garlic Knots, which were to DIE for! They were so good! Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I find it humorous when I go to different states and they claim to be selling New York pizza. I thought the crust was a little too thick and the cheese/toppings just fell off too easily. Over all wasn't bad. I am curious who is Joe and has he ever been to New York. The girl behind the counter had no idea who he was. Was a good attempt on their end to duplicate a real New York pizza."}
{"text":"Took forever, was soo dirty inside, and was the worst food I've ever had.  Walk next door to Gus's"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I order it at least once a month.Usually order the garlic knots which are so delish & come with either marinara or ranch. I also usually get Joes Favorite which is pepperoni, bacon, & mozzerella cheese and add mushrooms.toppings are generous, pizza crust is thin & crispy, delivery is fast & accurate."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Had heard h this place was good and it wasn't. Pizza by the slice reheated not fresh.  Crust was toasted, Not crisp. Probably running their oven to low to save a buck. Taste was just passable. The Italian sub was terrible. Thought it was a cold sandwich but toasted. Turned into greasy glob of cheese and meat dusted with lettuce. Mayo melted in bread from toasting. No vinegar and oil. Served in styrofoam, not wrapped. Sliced side pickle were thin strips(equaled a quarter, what cheapos!) Would've thrown it away but cost me 10 bucks. Try one of the other places nearby. They have to be better than this."}
{"text":"We order from here for the office and have them deliver for better service.  There with the delivery service of whole pizzas you are getting something. I think you will find value.  Large pizza with good ingredients and toppings delivered to the office when they promise.  The pizza tastes good.  It is delivered when they promise.  We have had a few mistakes and then will make it right doing what ever they need to do to satisfy the customer.  No complaint at all would keep doing it and plan to.  Thank you.    In the store is a different story.  Thus, the reason for the two stars.  It was a favorite lunch spot for a long time.  We used to go to the location on Las Vegas Bldv. south and order pizza by the slice.  They had the same employees there over the years.  They had a very busy lunch crowd.  They had specials too where you could get cheese and a drink.  They have specialty pizza in the display for sale like chicken, Hawaiian, lasagna, and veg.  They would recognize us when we came in and make the visit fun.    However, that all changed some time in the summer of 2017.  When we went there it was probably August of 2017.  I have not been back to the store for lunch since.  The regular employees were gone and had been gone for some time.  The crowds died down because they are running off all of the customers.  People don't want to be ripped off.  They have options.  There are actually about ten other places to eat within a quarter mile of this place and even in the same strip shopping plaza.     The reason the place is empty for lunch customers is the PRICE INCREASE.  They raised the prices.  Me and my co-worker have quit coming after this.  Two people each getting two slices and a small drink during lunch and the bill comes out to more than $22.00?!. That's insane.  I have been to Joe's pizza by the slice . . . . .oh, I don't know, maybe more than 100 times over the years.  Always get the same thing.  Two slices and a drink for me and two slices and a drink for my friend.  I know how much it should be.  It never ever came out to more than $20.00.  Did you think that people wouldn't notice?  Then the price changed.  I said something and then the woman showed me my receipt and said this is the price.  Four slices and two drinks.  Looked at the receipt (don't remember what they raised the pizza to) but I do remember they jacked to small drink price to something like $2.45.  Really? Won't go back.  Are you kidding me?  I hope this place closes."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza by the slice or delivery to your hotel! Staff is welcoming and efficient. Meat lovers slice was meaty and yummy. The veggie was also great! Loved the crust! Give them a try when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The pizza was fine, the mozzarella sticks warm, and the mac n cheese okay... HOWEVER I am giving you FIVE STARS for delivering my food in fifteen minutes when the estimate was 60-70 min. GOD BLESS (it was a long day)"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS HANDS DOWN.  How do you NOT crown Joe's top pizza in LV? Have you seen the SUPER MEATY? It's freakin' 2 layers of delicious mouth watering meat and cheese for $25! They delivered to my hotel, which was awesome! My gf and I only ate 3 slices of the super meaty and we tapped out. It was so good I literally wrapped it in plastic and drove 4 hours back home to Los Angeles to share it with my friends (well, after the weekend was over).   If you put 4 or 5 stars for a commercial pizza like the Pizzeria @ the Cosmopolitan then you don't know what pizza really is.   I still have 4 slices left in the fridge. Food for the week! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Delicious! It is pricey $4.65 for a plain cheese slice but like everything, you get back you pay for. My husband and I have been coming to Jose for over 7 years and it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"It was so good we had to come twice!!! The pizza is absolutely perfect! I had the spinach, ricotta cheese and artichokes pizza awwwwwww amazing! This will be our go to spot when we come to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Solid slices. Ambiance is slight. Very reasonably priced. Staff is pretty friendly. Haven't tried any of the pasta or other dishes--I'm a little scared to"}
{"text":"Let's just say it was nothing we expected. The pizza dough was perfect but the sauce and cheese just did not cut it. Cheese was very chewy and sauce literally did not taste that good. The garlic knots and marinara were the best part of what we ordered. I guess we'll search for another place to try and satisfy our pizza craving."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered from here in a couple months, but today was craving my usual Meatball sub and decided to go with a Stromboli instead. I also got wings naked, extra crispy and BBQ sauce on the side since my girlfriend likes that and I like hot sauce so I have plenty at the house. She got the meatball sub and a cannoli and I got the cheesecake. The food arrived when they said it would and the nice little older Italian lady dropped it off and said \"you haven't ordered in awhile\" always a friendly interaction which is rare these days with delivery drivers. My Stromboli was the best I ever had, stuffed with meatball, sausage, peppers, pepperoni, mozzarella, onion and ricotta. Her meatball sub was great as that's what we ordered the first time so decided to stick with it, but I wanted to try and see what else they did so great. To our surprise, the sub always comes with a pickle and a bag of chips. Wings were great also and prepared just how I asked, crispy with bbq on the side, they also had celery and ranch on the side that I didn't even ask for. Paper plates, utensils, Parmesan cheese and Red Pepper flakes also included. She said her Canoli was the best she's ever had. I'm saving my cheesecake for later, but I already know that's good. I still have half a Stromboli and some wings left for round 2! I found this place on the eat 24 app and had gone through so many other places in an attempt to find something similar to where I grew up on the east coast. Every neighborhood had that family owned pizza shop that was where you ordered out if you lived on that side of town. They knew you by name. Everyone from the delivery driver, to the guy that made your pizza. I've been looking for \"that place\" since I moved to vegas 6 years ago. They follow instructions and go above and beyond, most of all the food is amazing. These guys are legit and it took me a long time to find this kind of quality and class. Can't wait to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! You can get it whole or by the slice plus they're open till 5:00 am on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Went to Joe's Pizza the other evening and I have to say that I LOVE their sicilian pizza. Mmmmmm. The guy at the counter, Aaron, was smiling and helpful even though the place was extremely busy and crawling with embarrasingly intoxicated adults. I couldn't imagine dealing with that every night. . He managed to get me my food, help the line and keep a positive attitude. That's rare these days so I was definitely satisfied.   I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love it love it. Huge cheesy calzones...extra jumbo spicy wings. Got a white pizza added chicken it was amazing! Fast delivery . Very pleased .we will be using this spot for delivery again soon."}
{"text":"Was wondering....had passed by this location several times and thought I better try it....I did...and was PLEASANTLY surprised!  Got a slice of plain cheese...and it was FRIGGIN DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Best pizza I have had in ages....I'm from New York,..and I must say KUDOS to Joe's New York Pizza!  :)  !!!!  A little pricey... :(  ...but I will still be back ....because good pizza is hard to find in this city!!!  Especially when you are FROM Brooklyn!!!! :)  Thanks Joe's!  :)"}
{"text":"This is our third time coming here. It's a must stop every time we come to Vegas. Best Alfredo pasta ever! This pizza is really hard to beat. Can't find many places like this back in LA."}
{"text":"This place is okay for a NY pizza. Super priced for a Manhattan slice $5.35. I'd say the interior would need some work. Workers weren't friendly and tables were really dirty. Everything on the pizza was fantastic. The right spices and meat.   I wouldn't come back here because it's totally overpriced!"}
{"text":"We ordered Pizza, Pasta and Salads. The pizza Hawaii was very tasty as well as the Salads, both had great value for the price! The pasta Alfredo was good but nothing special. They said they would arrive in 45-60 minutes and arrived after 40-45!"}
{"text":"I'm late to the party- as it's taken me forever to try this place. I've long heard that this is where all the Old Town drunks show up after a night of shenanigans, and try and soak up the booze with this pizza.   Joe's is a small spot, with lots of easy street parking. I popped in for lunch and they have numerous pizzas out for you to choose your slices from. Once you pick what you want they pop it in the oven for a quick reheat.   The staff is super friendly and seem relieved to have customers who are sober for a change. I cannot imagine the shit show that is Fri/Sat nights after the bars close. Yikes.   Moving on, the pizza was surprisingly good. Very fresh and you can taste the quality ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was.   So when you need a quick lunch- check out Joe's. If you're there after getting hammered- pull yourself together and try and adult better. The staff there doesn't need your bullshit."}
{"text":"So... where can you buy a slice of pizza at 3:00 a.m.? Only a three or four places in the valley and I have tried them all... Good thin crust crispy NY style pizza... So, I says to my self, \"This is pretty decent pizza for 3:00 a.m. Then I think, \"This is pretty decent pizza any time...\" Give it a shot."}
{"text":"First off, the place gets five for the pizza alone. Haven't tried anything else. The slices are the best I've ever had. The crust is perfect and so is the sauce. If there is a downside, it's the dining area. It's small and not very inviting. 90% of the time I get it to go and eat it in the car."}
{"text":"Let's see where shall I start? Well first of, finding a parking on weekends is very inconvenient. My husband ordered some garlic knots and wings which I didn't taste because of my diet.  Then finally on my cheat day I decided to give it a try. We went in there late night on a Tuesday. Getting off topic a bit their hours are very convenient. Anyways I went in there to order some food service was not bad as everyone seems to complain about. I was greeted and taken care of in a timely manner. So I ordered a chicken roll and my husband a calzone. Wait time for my food was about 12 min max. Not too bad but not great either. I finally got my food and as I anxiously bit into my food I did not get what I was expecting! Pretty plain Jane. Not much flavor to it. There was way too much dough and you can taste the flavorless chicken. Like it just tasted like boiled chicken on dough. I didn't finish it because it made me nauseous. The flavor was just too unpleasant. So in conclusion I will not be going back! Their food did not appeal to me and one taste of that chicken roll was enough! Oh and by the way I gave them 3 stars because place was nice and clean, nice staff, great hours and food was cheap."}
{"text":"For a quick 1-2 slices of pizza its not bad at all, but a little expensive.  Yesterday, 2 slices of some sort of meat lovers type cost me over $10.  They were good sized pizza, but that seemed expensive for pre-cooked pizza that they toss back in the oven to re-heat for me.  I also ordered some full size pizzas from here in the past, but honestly I only did this because I had some really good coupons, otherwise again too expensive."}
{"text":"Well time has not made the chicken parmesan sandwich any better...in fact it reached its lowest point last night. It appeared as if a cook poured a shaker of salt into the sandwich and used some old cutlets to RIP me off of 10 bucks. Hey at least I got a free bag of chips right? If you must eat here you should be drunk and eat only 1 slice of pizza. Also the cooks are lazy because they never make sicilian pizza  assuming nobody eats this kind of pizza until after 8pm. Very odd behavior and a very disgusting chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"Their pizza tastes YUMMY and they sell it by the slice... Unfortunately if you don't show up at the right time you get a reheated slice... Not as yummy as it could be."}
{"text":"Been ordering Joe's Pizza for years.  The delivery is anywhere from 25-50 minutes. The pizza is fresh. We order the Italian subs and the dressing/sauce they put on it is fantastic. I usually order it on the side so the bread stays fresh. We are are not a fan of the french fry's or chicken tenders, they usually lack flavor and are soggy.  We order this food after a night in old town or a lazy Friday night. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I stopped here again to pick up dinner for my wife and I. She had the meatball sub and I got the italian calzone. I had their number in my phone and ordered. It was hot, ready and quick to pick up.  It was still hot when I got home. My calzone was traditional with ham, mozz and ricotta. Very good. Sauce on the side for dipping. My wife loved the meatball sub. I took a bite and it was tasty. 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place really looks like a New York Pizzeria. When you come in, the interior makes you feel like you're in NY.  It's a small place, there are 5 or 6 tables, plastic forks and knives...The service is bad. The workers are not friendly, they are even rude. No prices listed for a slice of pizza.   I've been here for several times and had a good experience though. But the last time when I ordered from home, I was quite disappointed. First of all, I got my order in about an hour and a half. It was soggy in the middle, the crust was very thick, salty and the sauce was bland. It went to recycle bin((( Their driver explained he had made another delivery since it was on the way to me, so it took longer than it should have. Oh well who cares.  Overall, if you want to satisfy your pizza hunger, try another pizzeria. This one is expensive and isn't worth the price and nerves spent on."}
{"text":"Its just a little pricey 4.00 plus a slice, buy the big pie..........its more reasonable.  They have a slice punch card if you buy by the slice.  Inside is very casual almost truck stop so I get mine to go.  EASY parking. which is great.  Pizza is my kids favorite I have to order extra for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm glad there is a place to get a good slice in this particular part of South Scottsdale. Although the delivery took quite some time , I will say it was worth it and the left overs made a great hungover breakfast."}
{"text":"Really good 'za with toppings that actually taste FRESH - A rarity in the pizza biz...  at least in Las Vegas!  I had their classic combo pie and it was very good and a close second to Metro, which is still my favorite in the city.  Also tried their chicken wings and must admit they are some of the best wings I've ever had.  Juicy, tastey and fresh!  Friendly service too! Highly recommended for pizza and wing fans!"}
{"text":"Awesome east coast style pizza!!  We always make sure we have Joe's when we travel to Scottsdale. Takes me back to the pizza I grew up on in New Jersey and Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this considering the positive Yelp reviews. Ordered a cheese pizza and BBQ pizza, maybe it's what a ordered but they were underwhelming and bland. The crust was fair not great, reminded me of papa johns crust which mind you is fairly good."}
{"text":"I like this pizza, its greasy, unhealthy and big portions. Definitely not a Settebello pizza but good in its own right."}
{"text":"Really surprised! I'm not one to like Marinara sauce, but, their Marinara and everything else is second to none! I highly recommend the Calzone or Stromboli."}
{"text":"Joe's is not the best pizza, but it is really tasty and very reasonably priced.  I would say the same thing about their eggplant parm and chicken parm sandwiches.  Clearly these were frozen things deep fried on the spot on decent bread.  For $5 though I couldn't complain.  Bottom line:  If you want some good and cheap eats, come to Joe's.  If you are expecting knock out pizza or italian fare, go elsewhere, but be prepared to drop more dough."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza online today after reading reviews. It was very easy to order online and I received both a confirmation email and phone call a couple minutes after placing the order and they let me know how long my order would take. By the time I got there about 20 minutes later, my pizza was ready. When I got home it was still hot...and soooo good! This is definitely the best pizza I've had so far here in Vegas. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Pizza is worth it. However they close at 10 PM and will not fire up a new pizza if they feel its too late. They took the family's order in front of us but we apparently were too late even though they had 25 minutes til close. We wouldn't have gone in that close to close but we thought they were open another hour yet. Saturday in Vegas and you close at 10, get real."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza about 5 times through a 3+ year span.. I also tried the other locatoin on Las Vegas blvd. twice, a couple slices each visit. For some reason, this location tasted better?!   Cumulatively, Their Pizza was Always on the Greasy side.. Thats a Major Negative for me. Thin NY Style pizzas, Great cheese, Another spot that loads toppings, dough just the right chewiness and crust plump with a nice hint of saltiness and sweetness. I've also tried pizzas that have this fat twisty crust, I mean Huge (Exaggerated) and it was delicous! Either eat it on its own or dip it in some marinara, pizza sauce or ranch..   My Experience: All PIzzas   - cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and a mix of each mentioned.  Their prices are quite expensive and pizza Greasy as mentioned. On a positive note,  they do bundle up the toppings and I believe they use \"Grande\" (high quality) mozarella cheese. Delivery was always quick and if your a pizza a fanatic, this place is worth a try.."}
{"text":"Best Authentic NY Pizza! I love the plain ,pepperoni and white pizza with meatball and mushroom. You will not be disappointed at all! This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Best pizza you'll find in Arizona. I'm from New York City and this pizza spot gets two thumbs up from me. The style is as close as you're going to get to NY pizza in AZ. The sicilian slices are amazing and really filling, make sure you ask them to make it fresh, it's worth the 10 minute wait. They have a nice selection of sodas, including my favorites root beer and cream soda. My boss and a coworker of mine told me about this place and I'm glad they did. The owner was really nice, I believe her name was Lori and I think she's from Brooklyn. She was so happy to see another New Yorker that she gave me and my girlfriend a couple of free slices along with some sodas. That was really cool of her. Actually the truth is we came here the night before and had a horrible experience. We were served old, bland tasting slices of pizza with no flavor or tomato sauce and the next day I ended up calling and asked to speak to the owner or manager and the lady who picked up said that that was her. I told her about my experience and she said that she was sorry about what happened and that she fired the worker who made those slices. she said he was on his way out anyway and probably messed up the slices on purpose out of spite, which does seem like something someone might do in that situation I guess. She told me to come in and she would show me how her pizza really tastes like. I decided to give the place a second chance and I'm really glad that I did. Everything we ordered she gave to us on the house and it tasted so much better the second time around. The pizza was fresh and had a good flavor to it. She said she wasn't in the previous night and that I would have never had a bad experience had she been there the first night I went. I think I believe her. She was so nice! If you've ever had a bad experience at this restaurant, speak with Lori. She will show just how good their food actually is. I like how they have two good sized televisions with whatever the best sports game at the moment is playing and hip hop music from new york playing in the backround. A chill spot, where you can eat good pizza and enjoy some beer as well. Most pizza restaurants with \"New York\" in their name in Arizona are just using the name as a gimmick and don't really sell NY pizza. This one actually does sell authentic NY pizza. The slices could use a little more salt and olive oil, but it's still pretty darn good. That would just make it perfect if they did that. I recommend this place to everyone. Thanks Lori for the awesome hospitality and the great food you serve at your restaurant. I dig this restaurant and will definently be coming back."}
{"text":"Arrived before ETA, pleasant and courteous service throughout entire process, from order to delivery. Pizza itself is excellent."}
{"text":"Forever looking for the New York pizza from my childhood only never to find it UNTIL I had Joe's pizza! Perfect chewey crust. And, the meatballs OMG! If you love garlic, gotta try to knots but warning - they are for true garlic lovers. YUM!"}
{"text":"Never have been here but seems like a cozy environment . Cashier was really friendly and showed me what was ready by the slice and tried to find the biggest slice for me to eat. Then put the slice in the oven and came out nice and hot. The crust was pretty hard but the pizza itself was pretty good. Reeaaallly pricy for one slice, I paid 5.79 for one slice  I would really have much enjoyed the food more if it was made to order but it kind of suck that the pizza that I ordered was just reheated in the oven so I feel like it was a little drier than it should've been had it been fresh. I wouldn't say that they have a lot of specials going on I have been to a place in downtown that gives you a slice of pizza and a beer for six dollars so I think the prices could be a little more flexible or at least offer a drink."}
{"text":"OK they are making the Sicilian again but what happened to the meatball & mushroom????? The new owners Need some help do let them know and they will be back on top again!!just ask and they will make it for you! OH yeah don't forget the Chicken parm or the meatball parm and the Sicilian it only takes 10 minutes while your eating the regular slice@"}
{"text":"Okay pizza. Not great. Usually, when we're in this area, we frequent Five Guys but, last time I ordered a burger there, with mushrooms, it was a soggy mess. So, we tried Joe's next door. It was just decent. There are far better places to get a slice of pizza in town; Rocco's, Secret Pizza at Cosmo are just two. The guy who takes your order allowed the 4 person party behind us to order before us (we were only 2) and they took forever to order. Switching between specials and asking a million questions...it's pizza people. By the slice. Why so much confusion? We also ordered beer battered mushrooms that were ok. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I've had the pizza at Joe's which is good, I enjoyed it.  But what I'll be coming back for is their Eggplant Parmigiana Hero!  OH MY GOSH it is the best!  I used to go to another restaurant to get this type of sandwich, but all of a sudden they stopped carrying it and said they never did, so it was something similar to a miracle that I found Joe's and they make it to absolute perfection!  And they deliver. that's always an extra bonus!"}
{"text":"Solid freakin slice of 'za to be had here!  Could do better on the beverage front, but they do what they do well enough to get away with it.  Open late for the drunks."}
{"text":"Worst service we've ever had. 2 fucking hours waiting for a pizza, called 3 times, and they delivered a cold pizza. Kept saying it was on its way. Don't order from here, ever."}
{"text":"I've been ordering every Friday for the last five years consistently. Looks like the original owners sold the place. Unfortunately the service has drastically changed as well as the menu. Now your phone order is taken to some answering service who has no clue what the heck is going on. Got our order wrong twice and the taste has certainly changed. The new owners are no New Yorkers my friend. They are clueless and clearly have not kept up the original flavor. I still love the delivery people as they are friendly but you can see they are also frustrated with new owners, i can see why. What do you think? Don't be scared, give an honest review. Some of the ones I read seem fabricated."}
{"text":"Coming in late night from LA and finding NY style pizza is awesome. I ordered a meaty and a couple of slices of pepperoni but expecting my order of baked potato fries they didn't charge me for so they had to take my order again and when I finally got them they were just plain fries... why are plain fries even an option ? Sleepy as hell I said screw it. The last straw was when I ordered another slice of pepperoni and waiting to find out they gave it to someone else and it was the last slice so I had to settle for pepperoni and sausage. Great pizza though, mediocre fries, customer service needs better communication."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent.  Good taste and decent value.  I had the pepperoni red pepper and goat cheese slice.  The goat cheese added a good tang to the slice. Quick and convenient. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Closest I've found to NY style in years, and it comes with NY prices (which I'm totally fine with!). Tried the cheese, gourmet pepperoni, and chicken artichoke. Ty to all you previous NY posters for pointing me in the right direction!  Bathroom was clean, service was good, no wait."}
{"text":"Love it!! Only thing is just go in for a slice because delivery and tax ends up being so expensive."}
{"text":"I really hesitate to say anything about pizza. I love pizza.   But I officially hate Joes. Last time I ordered here with my debit card, the next day my debit card number was stolen and used to buy prepaid phone cards.   I should have learned my lesson, but last week I was just craving pizza.   Now, I was checking my credit card statement, and I noticed that last week, they double charged my card once for the price of the pizza and again for the price plus what I tipped.   Unless you have cash, don't order unless you're ready for some shady stuff to occur."}
{"text":"Second time coming to Joe's Ny Pizza and not disappointed! The staff is so friendly, especially Ana she's helped us both times we came and she's the reason we keep coming back. Overall the food is delicious and so are the wings. The restaurant is always clean and neat. If you're in the area and are craving pizza I would stop by and get a slice. 5 out of 5 stars for me and we'll definitely be coming back soon agian!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and customer service! This is what a New York style pizza restaurant should be!"}
{"text":"Burnt pizzas, burnt garlic knots. Asked for marinara and ranch, only got ranch. Then woman cashing us out yells at my hubby because he told her we wanted a large drink, she rang in medium and scolded him for taking wrong size cup. Bad visit all around."}
{"text":"Love coming here. I get the Alfredo pasta with meat balls and it's the bomb. I'm always greeted with and smile. My food is always on time hot and ready."}
{"text":"Used to stop in for lunch when I worked close by. Buy 2 slices, get one free! I've never had anything other than the pizza. Staff isn't the friendliest."}
{"text":"4 Star Pie.  I like the cheese, oil, sauce, big style pep...It's a nice greasy NY slice.  I enjoyed the soft crust as well, but think there is too much of it and it needs to be cut down to half the amount.  I felt like there should be more pizza and less crust.  The price is dumb.  I order a large pep pie with coke and it came to 33 bucks.  If I was a cheap guy I would have rated it 3 stars.  Bottom line is if I lined this place up with all my favorite NY Pizza joints, this place would be average, but since it is located in LV Nevada, 4 stars all the way.    Lastly, the customer service was warm and on point.  I received a call letting me know that my online order was accepted and they didn't have Cherry Coke, so I had to go with Coke.  I received another call when the driver had 6 min left on his GPS and another when he was at the gate.  I like to know where my pizza is and when it got to my stomach I was satisfied."}
{"text":"The pizza is AWESOME. I ordered the small Super Meaty, OMG the flavor from all the meat, especially the smoke in the ham, the crust and dough. AWESOME. The mild wings were also Awesome, Crispy, just the right heat, not heavy in sauce.  I was staying at the Motel 6 around the corner. They delivered no problem. They do Charge a $3.50 fee for delivery. The food is worth it. They delivered on time, actually he was here in 35 mins not 45. Delivery guy was really polite. Thank you Joe's for an Awesome dinner. Will order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered at 1am from the Yelp Eat 24 App. Was told it would be 45 minutes to an hour. And hour and 15 minutes later I called the restaurant and they said the driver was on the way. Got the food around 2:30am. It was cold, and NOT very good at all. For the amount of money that I paid for this I was extremely disappointed. Would NOT order from there again. I understand that it was late night, and it was Las Vegas. However, if you can't deliver something that's edible in the time that you say you can, you shouldn't say you can. DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch today and it was all top notch.  Kris and Peter helped me at the counter and didn't rush me through the ordering process, even though there was a line behind me.  It was my first time here so wasn't sure what I wanted.... the house-made creamy feta dressing (suggested by Peter) was fab and why are these the only guys that know you shouldn't put hot chicken on a cold salad??? - it was on the side so it wouldn't wilt the lettuce.  Nice touch!  Thanks Kris for making our visit extra special with the aloha spirit shining through.  Just wish I would have found this place sooner - I've lived here 6 months and it was my first time in.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Minnesota and staying in Scottsdale.  There aren't many places that deliver, but thank goodness we found Joe's!  The pizza came promptly and it was very tasty.  For a huge pizza and salad, it cost $28.     Laurie, the girl on the phone was courteous and friendly.  She even threw in a piece of the thick crust pizza for us to try.  She also asked if we were sure we wanted the thick crust b/c it is really thick.  I'm glad she included the piece because it was thick, like pound cake and we were pleased she warned us.  The thin crust was perfect.  If you're in Scottsdale, go to Joe's website and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Vary bad customer service for delivery. Order from Rosties pizza much better they would not validate there own coupon. I thought guses pizza was bad they are just as bad."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a review on the pizza, but it was promised to be delivered in 30 minutes.  It arrived 90 minutes later, cold as ice.    In the store's defense, they say they're going to refund my money --  and the people at the store were very nice when I called about the pizza --  but that doesn't change the fact that I'm stuck in my hotel room sans food.  If you're staying near the airport and want to order pizza in your hotel room from Joe's....well, I'm sad to say that I have to warn you to think twice.  Order elsewhere.  I currently have a Pizza Hut pie on the way.  For sure, not my favorite, but at least I know that they are dependable..."}
{"text":"My Fav spot when I go to vegas for a Pizza crving :)...Pizzas here are big,yummy,full flavored and veryyy tasty..and the people here are cool and very friendly..I recommend this place highly ..never dissapointed here...."}
{"text":"We just flew in from Hawaii and our taxi cab driver recommend Joes pizza! He said it was the best Pie in Vegas! We gave it a try and he wasn't wrong!! We ordered the White Truffle and it did not disappoint. Delicious!  We're staying in a hotel and unfortunately the delivery driver did not bring plates and napkins! Hence the 4 star rating!  Maybe the person taking the order can ask if plates and napkins are needed or maybe just assume since your delivering to a hotel that they need it!  Other then that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"I finally found good pizza by the strip for when I'm working. Really nice small restaurant very authentic New York style pizza. I'll definitely be back to try some of the sandwiches and other things they have. Price point was very good. And as a plus they had one of those Coca-Cola machines where you can make basically every drink you want super awesome."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend just to kill time before work and oh my gosh the pizza is so good! And they have great specials and the slices are a size slice!"}
{"text":"Kristy did an amazing job when at the last minute we changed our mind. She was courteous and if she isn't the manager she should be. Give her a raise....she suggested things to try and was super sweet."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  I'm all about instant gratification, especially with food. I had tussled with another Scottsdale business who insisted delivery could take up to 40 minutes...for a sandwich and went on to option B, Joe's NY Pizza. The woman who answered the phone was great, didn't put me on hold endlessly, answered my questions and told me I could get my lunch in less than 20 mins. Good news, because I was STARVING (as in hadn't eaten for 5 hours).   Joe's doesn't charge a minimum for delivery, another relief so I ordered the greek salad and 1 slice of pizza with spinach. Delivery was quick and friendly, and my food was just what I expected from a pizza place. My pizza was a big juicy slice (not as big as a real NY slice but those things are ENORMOUS) with plenty of chopped spinach, a nice red sauce and a light coating of cheese. Entirely foldable, entirely into my belly. YUM.   The greek salad was okay - good price for the size of the salad, small chopped onion and black olive, a decent sprinkle of feta cheese. The only downside was the iceberg lettuce. I wonder if Joe's would consider a $1.50 supplement charge to use mixed greens. Because I would happily pay extra for some red leaf/arugula/mesclun blend. But it was fine as cheap salads go and filled me up.   If I need quick cheap delivery for lunch again, I will definitely call Joe's."}
{"text":"I don't think I'd know \"good pizza\" even if it was force shoved down my throat. (Open invitation to anyone who wants to buy me \"good pizza\" to teach me the difference haha) Anyway...I think 99% of pizza is good. It really is hard to mess up. I think the only bad pizza I've had has been the school lunch pizzas they would give me when I was little. The cheese was oddly white and a quarter of an inch thick, uninspired over added tomato paste, and white as a ghost crust. Then there's the pizza where when the cheese goes cold it turns to really gross plastic. For the most part, I figure it's good pizza when it's almost as good cold as it is when it's hot.  Ok...so enough about other stuff. I think we got a white sauce ricotta spinach pizza. I'm a meat lover but I was going to share this pizza and I know not everyone shares my love for meat (wink wink). I guess I've always been curious about non meat pizzas but always figured I wanted to get my moneys worth and go for the meat. Pizza was really yummy...It was good pizza....i think....I wanted to get everything on the menu...it all sounded super awesome and so many varieties! I think the only problem was that we weren't greeted or acknowledged...but that's the story of my life so maybe I shouldn't hold it against them.  It's off the main strip on a pretty calm side of a mall lot and was like a mile from our hotel. Fun times."}
{"text":"I was pretty satisfied with our pizza.  We ordered a pizza to go after a long day at a conference and it was pretty good.  We got half hawaiian w/jalepeno and half vegetarian and a green salad.  The slices were huge!  and really tastey.  The salad toppings were genric but the ranch dressing was awesome!    Pretty good prices, especially in Vegas, food is so expensive here!  You gotta try Joe's NY Pizza!"}
{"text":"Not happy with you joes. Don't bring correct order and don't offer to correct mistake."}
{"text":"Added basil but it was left off the pizza. A bit on the pricey side. 1 piece of chorizo per slice was not enough."}
{"text":"I ordered a small half lasagna,half Joe's special, to go.  They get slammed with, like 12 walkin customers.  After waiting, like 10 minutes,  which I was told that the order would take 10to15,  they hand me a Large and tell me that they didn't want me to wait.  Nice!!  The pies have always been great.  I like the fact that they have several pies ready to serve a single slice of."}
{"text":"This is not great pizza by any stretch of the imagination but it will get the job done at 2 in the morning after a night in the club. This place gets crowded but the line moves fast. It's also a good place to try to chat up a girl if you struck out in the club."}
{"text":"These people are shady. They say their delivery charge is 3.50 which I've never even been charged in the past. Myself and about 4 others usually order lunch here. We work right across the street. So what happened the last time we ordered? They hit each of us with about 9 dollars extra. I ordered a 9 dollar sandwich and was charged 16.50. How does that add up? And each of us? So your delivery guy got about 40 bucks for walking across the street? Screw you, I'll be talking to my bank. You not only lost about 50 bucks a day, but you're going to be losing out on the total. Idiots."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and friendly staff. I would definitely come back. Good place to come to get away from the casino crowds. Plenty to do in the shopping center surrounding the restaurant.  The meatball sandwich is really good too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite non-gourmet pizza place in the entire Valley.  As a transplant from the Northeast, Joe's satisfies my desire for decent New York-style pizza (and associated items like chicken rolls and garlic knots) in a metropolitan area that is largely devoid of high-quality \"by the slice\" pizza joints. I have visited both during the daytime and evening and have always found the service efficient and friendly.  If one has experienced less than stellar service at 2 AM, than maybe one should consider why he or she is getting that service. To borrow the lyrics of the New Radicals, \"you only get what you give.\" If I had to deal with some of the Scottsdale populace at 2 AM while in a state of exhaustion in a kitchen where the temperature is in excess of 100 degrees, I might be a little cranky too about having to deal with drunk antics.  I only wish there was a Joe's closer to downtown Phoenix. What this restaurant does is so easy! Why can't more Valley pizza restaurants do it? I guess we'll never know..."}
{"text":"Maaaannnn I love this place! Great pizza great costumer service! Thank you for the good pizza !"}
{"text":"We placed a delivery order 24 hours in advance for my birthday party. Half an hour after our scheduled delivery time, we called as there was still no food. Our order had never been processed, and it would be two hours before they could get food to us. There was no offer to discount or rush a delivery to us, as I sit here with a house full of people and no food. We had to scramble to order food from somewhere else, Needless to say, Joe's New York Pizza will never receive our business again."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the Phoenix Metro area. Open late and sooo delicious. If I'm going to eat pizza, I refuse to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Joe's is a great spot for late night pizza.  It is about the closest to NY style you can find in Vegas.  I would not recommend the fried brownies."}
{"text":"I'm in town for work every few months and stay at a nearby hotel. I'm never really here for long so pizza by the slice fits my dinner time window well.   As far as NY style pizza goes it is slightly above average pie. I applaud their creative topping choices and good selection of ready to go by the slice pizzas.   What I did not like is the prices, and their lack of a liquor license. So no beer and pizza here."}
{"text":"I am still so in love with Joe's. I have to update my serious love for this pizza since its been forever...  This is one of those local gems that not many tourists venture to find. I have had the opportunity maybe the last 4 times in 5 years to visit this place and wow, I have never been disappointed! The pizza is amazingly good. The portion is perfect, the flavor and creativity is awesome. Its been a tradition with my hubbster and my friends when we are in Vegas. Joe's has was it takes to make an ending of a perfect weekend of partying in Vegas unforgettable.  Quick Note: Menu has been updated since my last review, but my previous thoughts on Joe's is still very much valid. Check it..  OverALL: New York style in the sizzling desert. Pizzas that are super cool. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Even my 8 year old son said so upon his first bite.  Now I am literally forcing him to eat it because we have nothing else to eat in our hotel room. My 10 year old won't eat it either but he was quieter about it. If you like their pizza and are in the area, come and take our...PLEASE!  Save your money"}
{"text":"Their food is yummy. I wouldn't recommend a salad for all my veggie lovers! As for carbs and dairy, this place is on it! I wish the slices were a dollarish cheaper cause one piece is never enough for me. The staff is usually a hit or miss for me, but I don't blame them, considering where they work. I do love their pizza. And I want to check out their other location!"}
{"text":"I love this place it's the best! Great food and experince for friends and family. If your hungry for some ny style pizza come here."}
{"text":"Husband and I were in town on business and got back to the hotel late on night and had pizza delivered and it was FANTASTIC! The White Truffle Mushroom pizza was amazing! It arrived hot, the price was reasonable, a modest delivery fee, the pizza was flavorful and in fact everything was so good we ordered in sandwiches two nights later and they were good, but nothing compares to the Zeppoles we ordered as dessert. Do yourself a favor and get the Zeppoles. They also arrived hot and we without a doubt the best Zeppoles I have every had. I tried one and immediately stopped eating my sandwich and started in on those.   Only caveat, have the phone person repeat your address. The second night we had someone not pay attention and they delivered to the wrong hotel. But the Zeppoles are so good I forgave them. Really. That. Good."}
{"text":"I really like the pizzas here...it's not my all time favorite pizza place, but they are definitely up there.  They use decent quality ingredients from what I can tell and the food is made with obvious skill and interest and they really hit the spot for when I'm having that comfort food, Pizza craving urge.  Every time that I've ordered delivery, they have been on time and from a friendly delivery person so no complaints there.  My favorite Salad from here is the Nutty Italian and at 8$ Dollars or so, it's not inexpensive per se, but it can easily feed 2 people and has numerous fresh quality ingredients and with the Vinegarette it's quite memorable.  I think the Garlic Knots are overrated, but since they are free with a large order of food from here...the more the merrier.  My favorite pizza here is a large thin crust Garlic with extra cheese. Bon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Decent enough if you're in the neighborhood and want a slice of pizza. The restaurant was clean (the staff was mopping the floor while I was there), and very nicely decorated to look like a NYC pizza joint.   I was a little put off that prices weren't listed on the menu, however. 2 slices ended up costing around $14. The slices were big, but nothing to write home about. I got the BBQ chicken, and my mom got the pepperoni. The crust was good, but mine tasted a bit old, and I didn't love the sauce.   I suppose if you have a hankering for pizza and happen upon Joe's, stop on in, but I wouldn't make a special trip to seek them out."}
{"text":"I ordered a bag of chips with my pizza.. when I got home I noticed the bag was not fully sealed. The chips were stale from being open. EW"}
{"text":"Came in for a slice on a whim, and wow. Wish I was coming back to Vegas sooner, that was GOOD."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Fresh and a good lunch special! They offer sandwiches and much more! Small Dining area though!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering food from here and it was awesome!! I would suggested it for All pizza lovers!!"}
{"text":"Just had it tonight and it was fairly good pizza, not great though. The slices I got were pepperoni and a chicken alfredo slice (?) but they appeared to have been sitting out for a bit so perhaps if fresh would have been a bit better. Either way a good place to get some fast grub especially if you are out for some drinks. Will review again after a fresh slices."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Vegas and needed a good meal before catching a flight in the morning. Joe's pies were awesome!  We had a Frat Boy (Greek: black olives, spinach, tomatoes and feta plus a Pepp and Cheese).  Cooking and delivery was very quick, much faster than the Yelp delivery software estimate, which made the family (and me) very happy.  Smiles all around!"}
{"text":"I've never been to NY, so I can't compare the pizza AND I'm a die hard Chicago pizza fan, so I am a little biased; however, if this is what NY Pizza tastes like, it's better than I thought. The pizza is crazy good and the calzones are even better."}
{"text":"Maybe a little better than Sbarros but definately not authentic NY pizza"}
{"text":"Really I gave you a wrong address? We were regulars for the whole summer and you had my address in the computer.  Please spare me the bs. The lady on the phone was rude and refused to refund my money. I had to contact the bank.  As far as the lady who commented that she was in line and had to wait longer. You are full of crap. You were not on the phone with me so you have no clue what was said. And if you had to wait longer it was due to the morons working there because the phone call lasted 15 seconds.  This place I never liked but for some reason they did make a good calzone 50 percent of the time my wife liked but we found better calzone. The food sucks, The employees suck. And they would not know what NY pizza even if they were in little Italy!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Scottsdale resort and conference center after midnight starving after traveling cross country.  This place is open until 4am and delivered a nice large thin crust sausage pizza with extra cheese in about 30 min.  Considering that this is not NYC or Chicago, the pizza was very satisfying and reasonably priced.  Tasty thin crust pizza from a delivery place that opens very late to satisfy post midnight cravings.  Hit the spot.  Would order again. Not gourmet or artisanal pizza but very tasty and satisfying.  Much better than dominos or papa johns or similar chains.  Would give 3.5 stars for late night/early morning opening and delivery."}
{"text":"UNRELIABLE. UNPROFESSIONAL.  DO NOT USE FOR DELIVERY. I ordered a large pizza with garlic knots on line for delivery (work function).   The pizza never showed up and when I called, the guy who answered sounded like he just woke up. He said \"Oh, well our fax machine is broke.\"   He asked if i still wanted the order and judging by his manner, I said no and that i would like a refund.  He asked me what website did I place the order on, he has no record of it and he needs to call me back.  Then he hung up on me and I am out 25.00!!!!  Will NEVER give this place another chance.  Our work location is pretty close to Joe's, and they will not be receiving future business from us."}
{"text":"We ordered for a work celebration and the pizzas were a hit.  I thought I ordered too much but the pizza was gone in minutes!  Everyone commented on how good it was.  They delivered on time and I will definitely order again.  The white pizza by the way was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for NY style slices. The buff chicken wasn't what I expected, the buff sauce was a little overpowering. Maybe stick to a more traditional slice, I also got the spinach and feta which was much more to my liking. It actually tasted like pizza. My coworker ordered a meat pie slice and when we got back to the office it turned out to be spaghetti pizza... He says it's just \"alright\" but was expecting his usual pound of meat.  Either they got it wrong or changed the menu we're not sure. My other co-worker ordered the Chicken pesto panini which they made on the spot and described it as \"effin awesome.\"    Overall the novelties like the fried mushrooms are always a hit just expect to pay a little more by the slice."}
{"text":"The food is exactly what it says. Nothing hidden here. Well done! And reasonably priced in this sea of over charging that is Vegas! Strombolis were huge. Should have shared one. Had leftovers for lunch  Only issue is with delivery. Bally's won't let them come up to rooms. So be prepared to meet them downstairs. And know your entrances. North faces Las Vegas Blvd. but even the delivery time was impressive at only 35 minutes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places. We go here every Friday for lunch. I'm a big fan of the meat pie or the hawaiian special. Definitely something to check out."}
{"text":"My wife and I had their lunch special yesterday (2 pepperoni slices and a soda). The pizza was fresh, slice was cut large, and the service was very good. We'll gladly eat there again."}
{"text":"Good pizza that delivers, I'm happy!  My friend purchased a Groupon deal ($15 for $30 worth of food) for this place while we stayed at Paris. However, they cannot deliver to certain hotels (in order for hotels to promote their temporary residents to eat at their central eateries-- Paris was one of them), so we had to be creative and have Joe's NY Pizza deliver to Planet Hollywood, which was right next door.  Mary (I believe that was her name) was way helpful with our ordering and suggesting foods for us to order so that we can make the most of our deal. We had a large pepperoni pizza, a large salad, soda, water, and chilled Starbucks frappuccino for the next day. Delivery was $1.50 and we gave a big tip because we had the delivery guy wait 15 minutes for us as we tore through Las Vegas Blvd to meet him.  My friend and I had a deliciously filling meal at our hotel before we prepped for a night out in town. I'm giving this place 4 stars for their wonderful service, help, and patience with us."}
{"text":"My favorite Phoenix pizza joint! Wonderful service! The woman who generally answers the phone is so polite and friendly. On top of that, the delivery guys are always friendly too. The last time I ordered, I was pulling an all-nighter to finish a final and it was 2:30AM. Between the time I ordered and the delivery, it started pouring rain, and the delivery guy was 10 minutes later than they quoted me. I didn't even mention it, but he apologized anyway and was extremely thankful and friendly.   The pizza is SERIOUSLY good! I love thin crust, New York style pizza and this place truly gets the job done! Delivery is always fast and customer service is excellent. They're open late and they're always appreciative of your patronage.  After trying a gazillion pizza places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, I finally found the place and I will not order from anywhere else. If you normally order from Gus's, give Joe's a shot and I bet you won't go back.  TIP: Pizza is excellent, but if you're in the mood for something else, try the Penne and Broccoli with chicken. It's really good. Don't expect fancy Italian restaurant quality, but it's still a damn good meal.  TIP#2: The Garlic Knotts are SUPER Garlic-y. If you're not a fan of TONS of garlic, ask them to go light on it. I can't stand too much garlic, but my boyfriend loves it and is now addicted to these. Seriously - expect to be chewing on pieces of garlic. I'm not complaining though - they're still really good :)"}
{"text":"I've been here two times. Both times my pizza was slightly burned in the reheating process. I like my pizza extra crispy but it was definitely overdone. The combination of flavors were good otherwise."}
{"text":"Before I start the review doesn't this pic of my calzone have some resemblance of Stewie? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-new-york-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=KX0vC9q5aXqaMoZ1Orqaag#4hKGM_5fPxYbyMR384Q2Uw   I was feeling like a calzone one day and wanted to try a place different from my usuals. A coworker always had Joe's New York Pizza and it looked good since I had never been I figured why not.  Checked out their menu online and placed the order for one of their 3 Item Monster Calzones.  The calzone was pretty huge for the price so I was very happy at first.  It was load with ricotta, mozzarella, marinara, and a ton of pepperoni, no exaggeration.  Only thing I didn't like about it was the dough was undercooked.  I was literally eating uncooked dough that had a little toast to it.  It's a good thing work had a little toaster oven I throw it in and went back to work, the room smelt so good.  I don't know if they usually under cook their calzones or if it was because I customized my calzone and didn't know how adjust for that, I don't know.  In the future I'd asked them to leave it in the oven longer.  I have to give them solid OK considering I could've gave them a MEH for undercooked calzone dough but I heard they have AYCE pizza during lunch or before dinner, don't know the details but that's cool.  And from what pizzas I've seen looks pretty good.  They have a good selection of items on their menu. I like the interior and that you can order online."}
{"text":"On a quick layover at McCaren and had a chance to get out of the airport to meet someone and have a slice of pizza.  The cost for 2 slices $8 and some change.  The slice was decent, and almost as hot as a solar flare.  There is a large selection of pizzas, so I am sure everyone can find something that they like.    What did I learn today?  There is not dedicated pre-check lane at the Alaska Air gates at McCaren."}
{"text":"Any place can make a good tasting pizza, but if the service isn't good, then there's a dime a dozen. We literally live 1 stop light from this location and it takes over an hour for a delivery, also the gentleman that answers the phone reacted completly clueless and could care less. We go there all the time but after this i'm going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really last resort for pizza delivery. The food is sometimes okay, but quality and service is really bad when they are busy. I've received one really good pizza, then another time one that doesn't taste great and makes me feel sick."}
{"text":"Not the best place. Sure, it's good for a quick bite for those who aren't too selective, but you can find much better pizza elsewhere. The pizza just isn't that impressive. Too greasy, and pretty bland, to be honest. It wasn't terrible, but I regretted ordering from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best cheese pizza ever! Ordered the humongous Super Cheesy pizza. BOMB and it was huuuuuge!"}
{"text":"I try just about every pizza joint near me and this is one of my favorites.  Something about the cheese at this place reminds me of the pizza I'd get in Pittsburgh.  Another great thing about this place is they sell it by the slice.  Good, greasy, thin, NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Only had one thing here and I crave it all the time- the caprese panini. The fresh mozzarella is like butter. Even though the tomato itself is not that great, it transforms into a savory violin in an orchestra of flavors. The bread is right on. It's a messy sandwich. The salad that comes with it is weird though. It's hardly any greens, tons of raw red onions and a TON of dressing. Make sure to tell them you are a local to get a discount. Lots of booths to sit comfortably in and they have a small outdoor seating area. I always see families here. Staff is not always the most professional or approachable, but this sandwich makes it all forgivable."}
{"text":"Yikes! The worst pizza ever eaten.  This place used to be good, a few changes in ownership and this place is now horrible.  Pizza was not adequately cooked.  The toppings all slipped from the crust when picking up a piece.  They also gave free garlic rolls with the order. They were also undercooked & inedible."}
{"text":"Our Uber driver highly recommended Joe's!  Not too far off the strip, directly across the street from Hard Rock Casino. Open Late. Friendly staff. Plenty of parking. The food was excellent! Pizza great! Cheese Bread OMG! and the hot wings were delish!  If the locals go here, then you KNOW it's good!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST delivery pizza you can get at 4am in the morning at LVS.  Super cheesy. Super garlicky. Super awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Good pepperoni pizza and their gourmet grilled chicken salad is really good and large."}
{"text":"cost about $3.78 with tax for a slice of pepperoni.    Not bad for a NY style pizza, but it's definitely NOT on that Lombardi's, Grimaldi's, or Nick's (Queens) pizza level.  It's gotta be that NY water that makes that REAL NY PIZZA."}
{"text":"by far my FAVORITE pizza place in Vegas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we have been coming here for years and I am never disappointed that I came !!! the best pizza ever , I love the lasagne pizza and then just the pepp and sausage , they also make the best ranch dressing I have ever had , you can just drink the stuff , they also have great wings and the greek salad is amazing . I also just tried the mac and cheese bites and loved them . The service here is fabulous and they treat you like family when you visit the restaurant , def one to add to your list !!!!!"}
{"text":"I am always searching for a good slice of NY Cheese and Joe's sells by the slice which makes it convenient. I actually prefer the already baked pies and the reheat because it gets the crust nice and it has that crunch I am looking for.  The customer service experience has always been great. I am a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as I heard pretty good things about this location.  Having been my first time here last month, I was excited to take my son here as his favorite food is PIZZA.  One of the good things here is they do sell pizza by the slice.  They have an assortment of pizza made and will heat up your choice in their oven OR you can have them make a pie to order.  My mom had a slice of the hawaiian, I had a slice of the mushroom and pepperoni, while my son had the pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  As we sat down and waited for our order, the couple next to us took their slice back as we over heard that there was a strand of hair on one of their slices. Can I just say YUCK! and what a way to spoil an appetite.  I debated whether my family and I should request for our money back or just wait and eat our food.  When I saw that their slice came from a different pie, we just decided to stay since we were really hungry.  The slices are generous; however my mom's Hawaiian was soggy!  She couldn't even pick it up to eat it.  She had to use a fork.  When I told the lady at the counter about it, she merely stated that it was due to the slice actually coming from a Pie that had just been taken out of the oven...ummm ok but I do recall having pizza to order and it not being soggy and thought to myself, ok if thats her story and she's sticking to it...so be it...LOL!  My slice was just ok and my son...well he oved his garlic knots and just took one bite of his pizza.  I will end this with, I've had better and will most likely not be returning to this place.  I'll stick to Grimaldis or Metro pizza.  I would put this place in the same category as the pizza places inside a mall's foodcourt.  Nothing fresh and/or special about it."}
{"text":"We go to Joe's at least 2 times a week. Pizza by the slice is great, everyone has a different option, this is perfect if you eat with a group.   I enjoy the pizza and the staff here, if you go at lunch time during the week you may run in to me."}
{"text":"Looked good, but tasted gross. The crust is too buttery and not crispy or chewy. This is a failed attempt at a NY slice. I couldn't even finish my second slice. It just tasted bad."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale from Indianapolis, Indiana, and I was looking for some good pizza late at night. This restaurant is open until 4:00 a.m. and serves pizza by the slice. I got a slice of cheese pizza, and my husband got a slice of pepperoni and sausage pizza. We both loved the pizza and glad we tried it!  We will definitely return when we come back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome & the food is even better. The wings are cooked just right with mouth-watering sauces. Look to the right for more wing sauces than are listed above head. Large variety of pizza types. I recommend for quality, prices, & people."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Get the gourmet pepperoni it's is so so good! I have been dreaming about this place since we came here last year!"}
{"text":"We had good pizza. Not great but good! Open at midnight, close to the strip, lots of parking in the plaza it is located in and several choices of slices. Of course at that hour, a couple of pizzas looked fresher than others. We chose a slice of the lasagna pizza and a slice of the sausage. The one thing memorable was the ricotta on the lasagna. Really tasty. The slices were large but it tasted like pizza you could get anywhere. Decent service."}
{"text":"the pizza here is ok. the pizza by the slice looks like it's been sitting out there pretty much for a few days. they take your slice and put it in the oven and it comes out piping hot. supreme was really good, but the chicken pesto was dry and with no real flavor."}
{"text":"Delivered early and was legit. Thin crust New York style with wings and garlic curls. Service was good and for a great price. Awesome."}
{"text":"It's decent.  We had thin crust.  I'm not sure if there were any other types of crust.  It's cheap at $3 a slice.  It's pretty small inside and usually there's a line out the door.  However, the line goes fast."}
{"text":"Writing this angry... Their hours changed for Saturday. They close at 10pm instead of 11pm. #angryhungrypizzacustomer :'("}
{"text":"Man, so disappointed in what has become of Joe's Pizza. Maybe my memory isn't serving me well but, when I lived in Scottsdale a decade ago, this was a great slice and even reminded me of actual nyc style pizza.   In a recent visit last weekend I ordered a couple slices and was shocked to see how bad the quality has become. Flavorless pizza on a cheap dough and low quality ingredients. I gotta tell ya, I know this is a late night stop in old town but, you're better off stopping at a grocery store on the way home and grabbing a pizza from the frozen section.   It's a shame that \"NY\" is even a part of the name of this business because it couldn't be further from the truth."}
{"text":"I want some pizza. New York Style, thin crust. Because lets be honest, is there really any other kind? No, I don't want effing truffles on it...no micro-greens on a white pizza...no God Damn organically harvested arugula or duck confit by the whole wheat slice....today I just want a slice of Pizza.  Joe's New York Pizza.  Cheesy fold out tables? Yeah. NYC propaganda plastering the walls? Oh yeah. Do they serve yoohoo and snapple out of a coke fridge? Hells yeah...(do you have any idea how long its been since i've even SEEN a snapple?) The occasional fly? sure. The gray haired mafioso looking guy sitting outside in a suit reading the paper in 108 degree weather. Check.   Pizza's ready; Greasy? Perfectly! Check the bottom real quick, does it have that ever so telling little black char from where all the great pies before it left there charred remnants in that ovens bottom? Yeah...very nice. Smells great, sauce is flavorful. Moment of truth....does it fold? Yeah, crust snaps into place, slice perfectly folded in half...greasy pizza juice running down my hand, and yeah...this is the God Damn Pizza i've been craving."}
{"text":"Not even close to NY pizza. Sorry guys. Also it's way too expensive. Good luck with the business. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have never ever had a pizza so bad. If I had defocated in a sock stuck it in the freezer and served it to my mother and grandmother I would have been less disgusted than I am with myself for having half a slice of this. I feel violated for just being here once. The choice between even considering eating here again and spending the rest of my life in a Serbian prison listening to Justin Bieber 24/7 you better believe Despacito will be on the decks before you can say \"Joes Ny Pizza is a disgrace to all culinary endeavours\".  I would like to add that I downloaded Yelp just to give this place a review"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good wings, very nice delivery guy. And they deliver to southern highlands!"}
{"text":"So goooood. I haven't had a pizza here that wasn't great and you can buy it by the slice which comes in handy at lunchtime. Try the lasagna or gourmet pepperoni (it has goat cheese!)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place with pizza like this for a while now. I can't stop thinking about it! Unfortunately they are way out of the way for me but it's definitely worth the trip. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Short: A mirage of legitimate New York pizza hanging around the middle of the dessert.   The Pros: - Affordable! - Open late (4 a.m.)! - Beer delivery! - Decent menu options. - Greasy pepperoni (for those that like that kind of thing).   The Cons: - Staff can be hit or miss (night staff much better than day). - Pizza is pretty bland beyond the scrum-diddly-umptious pepperoni grease.  - Uses McDonald's grade ingredients.  - Some items, such as garlic knots, have a tendency to be undercooked.   Best Item(s): - Pepperoni pizza. - Spaghetti w/ meat sauce.  Stay Away From: - Garlic knots. - All veggie pizzas. - The restroom! I now suffer from PTRSD (post-traumatic restroom stress disorder).   __________________________________________   The Story:   When reviewing a restaurant it's essential to consider the type of establishment it is trying to be. What is their overall game plan? What are they trying to sell you? For example, you wouldn't give Dicks Last Resort a negative grade for customer service. The staff treating you like the butt of an Archie Bunker joke is kind of their thing.  So with that in mind, I approached Joe's New York Pizza after a night of debauchery and loud music in Old Town Scottsdale. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and garlic knots, had a pleasant conversation with the staff, and walked back to my hotel to enjoy my post concert nourishment.   The inside of Joe's was pretty standard for a late night eatery. Everything looked like it was a heart attack waiting to happen and the surroundings weren't particularly clean or dirty. That offbeat middle point that only a place open at 2 a.m. is able to find.   Back in the hotel, I was astonished how amazing the pizza tasted. It was about 70 percent grease, but that grease was the most delicious substance I have ever had. I would have free-based it if such a thing were possible. The same could not be said about the garlic knots. They had the flavor of a week old pretzel pulled out of the mall dumpster. Two bites were enough.  The next morning I decided to give Joe's another visit. It was at this point I realized how much the loud music had affected my judgment the night before. The entire place was dirty (all of the tables needed whipped down and I'm fairly certain the Custer's Last Stand had just occurred in the bathroom). An eclectic mix of individuals, who matched the emotional level of a Nine Inch Nails crowd in the early '90s, replaced the once exuberant staff. The pizza grease still tasted like a solid brick of pepperoni, which is a good thing, but the cheese was beyond inedible. It was a night and day difference (get it).   I am very confident that the night staff was a sociable as I remember, but nothing else matched the enchantment of my first time there.   It makes sense though. Awards for being 'the best cheap place to eat' were hung on every wall in the dinning room and precisely define the restaurant. It's the McDonalds of late night pizza. The problem is, I can eat McDonald's fries anytime. I know they're the potato version of plastic surgery, but they still have a taste that almost anyone can enjoy. That's their one item. For Burger King it's the Whooper. Joe's doesn't have this. Their pizza hasn't hit that pinnacle yet. My guess, using a cheese that doesn't make me want to set my tongue on fire would fix the problem.   Joe's is likely satisfied with their place in the culinary world. Inebriated customers rarely complain and usually tip pretty well. I expect this place to stay three stars for a long loooong time."}
{"text":"Literal worst pizza place in Scottsdale. Delivery was 15 minutes late, bad customer service and most disgusting soggy pizza."}
{"text":"I am in awe by how good this effin pizza is. Mind blown. Defiantly lives up to the name and ive been to Joes in New York.  I don't understand why this place doesnt have 5 stars. People are out of their mind!!  Thin and perfectly crispy crust, just melts in your mouth. Perfect ratio of ingredients, and the pepperoni is nice and crispy. I'm considering going back and getting two more slices!!  Please don't ever change!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Looks like an average pizza place, but that is wrong. Everything tastes fresh and hot. They put some real thought into their combinations. A meal from Joe's NY Pizza is a meal in the right direction!"}
{"text":"Another solid lunch from Joe's today. Went with the 2 slices of pepperoni and soda lunch special. Pizza was cooked perfect, perfect amount of pepperoni, and excellent service.  Still a very solid 4 stars while being right on the cusp of 5. I wish they had a few more options for pizza by the slice. Today they only had 3 pizzas made and it was 12:30. A little more variety and I'd be inclined to up the rating.  Also, excellent job carrying Mr Pibb. As a Dr Pepper/Pibb connoisseur I find this a necessary part of my lunch. When an establishment doesn't offer either it just brings the whole meal down."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Joe's for about a year now and Kris H is always the best! I'm a creature of habit so she already knows my order and gets it ready quickly which is appreciated since I'm often tight on time at lunch. Love the food too - great pizza :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good lol well I thought it was. First night in Vegas on a semi cold weekend gateway and was craving some pizza for dinner minus the Shakeys or resturaunty pizza chain feeling and this place definitely hit the spot. None of that crap, although sometimes it's nice but sometimes you just want to find a nice causal laid back pizza place without the noisy chain feeling you know. Anyways came in got two slices of there already made pizza which was then heated up and served up while tasting pretty fresh, crunchy but not too crunchy, and pretty darn good! Not omg freaking awesome but for what I was looking for fit perfectly like ice on a rocks glass yum :p. Next time I'm in Vegas and craving a good slice of pizza I will definitely recommended ir come to this place."}
{"text":"Best Pizza anywhere in Phoenix area. By the slice or the entire pizza. We enjoyed our 4 different slices so much, we ordered a plain pie to go. I have found Pizza Heaven in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I paid for an 8 piece chicken tender and they gave me only 6 and the menu even says 8 piece and when I confronted them about they said the owner changed the price but why wouldn't the owner change it on the menu before charging customers for the lesser value this place is very unorganized and rude plus the fries are gross !"}
{"text":"Worst $28 I've ever spent! My pizza wasn't warm and it was dried out. Maybe it's because they placed it in a giant box and it got cold faster? I threw it in the trash after a few bites. These ingredients don't taste fresh. It tastes like it's been in the fridge for a week. Now I need to go to a different restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering a delivery from Joe's New York Pizza, the person who took my order also brought our food to the Carriage House. Israel had the best phone manners we have not heard in a long time. She takes her job serious and is the reason we will order from JNYP again. I had the Italian Sub and my wife had spaghetti meatballs along with garlic knots. Everything was great. If you should order from here make sure you ask for Israel she won't let you down and will assist you if you don't know what to order."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the world?  No. Good enough (and I'm picky about my pizza)?  Yes.  I'm not saying you should walk here from the Strip, but if you're staying at the Hard Rock or nearby, and want to grab a slice, just walk across the street.  Reasonably priced, quick service, nice guy at the counter.  There is pizza next door at some new place that opened but that's a more upscale restaurant-type place.  Tons of taxi drivers, locals, tourists, even a few families were packing the place.  Open late.  Note - they used to deliver to the Hard Rock but are no longer allowed to (a note at the counter for staff says they will be arrested if they come on site.  Seriously?)"}
{"text":"Got Joe's Favorite Pizza delivered to The Mirage during my vacation. It was about 130am and it was amazing! The only downside was a large delivered to the valet area cost me almost $35 including tip. But that's expected considering its Vegas. It was great to have paper plates and napkins brought with my pie without me asking!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. The service and my dad's tummy after eating the chicken wings---awful!! We got our order but noticed they missed our side of fries. I immediately asked a girl behind the counter if the fries were coming out. She looked at the cooks to see if the fries were made and they said no. She looked at me and said it will be out in a few minutes. We ate our entire meal and never got the fries and never got an apology. The girl served other patrons and never acknowledged us.   My dad also ordered the chicken wings as hes a wing fan. He got the wings and after tasting it immediately said the wings weren't fresh or crunchy, which he requested. We asked the guy who served us if we can get deep fried wings like we were told instead of the oven baked they gave us. He said sure and comes back with the same wings stating he didnt know until then that their deep fryer was not working. My dad said thats fine and tried the wings again and kept saying it wasnt fresh but didnt want to be a bother. The next day he told me that he had stomach aches and tummy trouble all night! I guess he was right and they served nasty old wings not cooked the way it was supposed to be. Awful service!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the scottsdale area for business over the past 10 days and ordered delivery from Joes 3 times. Each time the food arrived, hot, fresh and quickly. I would defiently recommend Joes as a great takeout option in the old town area. One time I even asked for them to customize my pizza (extra sauce, less cheese, add toppings and cut a certain way) they followed the direction and the pizza was delicious. The only thing I ordered last week that I wasn't a big fan of was the salad with salami, cheese and roasted peppers. The cheese and salami were mixed together and cut together so it was difficult to remove the tons of cheese they put on the salad. It didn't taste bad just not what I prefer. Pizza and fried snacks however were great. I'd recommend trying the eggplant on a pizza!"}
{"text":"We were staying at Cancun Resort so we decided to call in some pizza  it was horrible!! Hardly any cheese and so greasy!! I would never order from this place again !! I had to throw the pizza away!! Even the kids didn't want to eat it."}
{"text":"The Spanish pizza was suppose to have chorizo...mine did not. The crust was also soggy, pizza was under cooked. It did come fast, probably since it was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"Ok so I saw the reviews and as a benefit of the doubt I'm like why not it was pretty even on the reviews good versus bad ones.. so i must say the delivery was great and the delivery young man was very polite and professional.. now going back to the pizza  I must say and I feel horrible writing this but that had to be the worst pizza I ever had in my life !! There was 0 flavor I literally felt I was eating air lol !! It was so soggy I try to eat my first slime and it broke in half the bread was so wet it was disgusting!! And I never seen thin crust that way that was thin slice not thin crust !! Thin crust supposed to be nice crispy!! I literally took the whole think and I threw it in the trash!! The price was outrageous 34$ for a large pizza which looked more like medium??  honestly I'm so mad I spent so much money for nothing!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing. I had a piece of the pineapple and ham pizza. The slice was huge and filled me up. If I wasn't so full I would have gone back for another. The staff was friendly and fast with the serve! When your in Las Vegas this is a must stop to eat!"}
{"text":"I went here last week with my daughter for lunch the staff was super friendly and the pizza was awesome we just got slices but we will be back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"These guys are a joke. I ordered a pizza and chic parm sandwich at 8:37 on on a Monday night. At 9:20 I called to confirm it was on its way, I spoke to who seemed like the owner or mgr. He said 8 minutes, lots of traffic. I said is the food on its way, I said has driver actually left, he would not answer the question. It is now 10:06 pm and nothing while I breathe in the fumes at the valet area of the hotel. What a joke. Number one on Yelp, who stuffed those ballets. Run to a different location. Why have a restaurant if you don't do what you say. I'm still starving."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and have not reviewed it yet. they consistently do a good job here the pizza is always really good and I like how crisp it up and he did it right before they give it to you. They now have one of the coke freestyle machines which are fun. tonight's pizza was excellent as always."}
{"text":"Had a craving for spaghetti and wings.  After searching on yelp I decided to stay close to home.  I always pass this place and never tried it.   As you walk in they have high top tables in the center, half booths on one side, and booths on the other side.  They have ready made fresh pizza's on display sold by the slice or you can choose something from the menu.  They have a pretty good menu of appetizer, pizza's, salads, subs, pasta, and desserts.   I went with the 10 pice wings mild.  The wings were so delicious!  It hit the spot.  The wings were cooked just right with the right amount of crunch and the flavor!  OMG!  My new favorite place for wings.   The meatballs were amaze balls which I snuck a taste from the meatball sub which comes with chips.   I shall be back for more wings and I'll try a pizza next time along with some dessert!"}
{"text":"What can I say? We love it here! Friendly, hot fresh food, quality is consistent, and we love the atmosphere. We drive quite a ways to have it at least every other month. Favorite pizza in town!!! Hands down! We get the hawaiian! A little on the expensive side, seems like there was a price increase lately. Other than that, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you're in Old Town Scottsdale I highly suggest Joe's. It is perfect for a lunch run with their lunch special or an amazing late night snack.   I worked at an office building across the street and ate here quite a bit (more than I probably should have). Most of the times it was for their lunch special which is buy two slices and get a third free, I believe its normally around $6 which is a good deal especially in Old Town.   In terms of their actual pizza, I am a big fan of the bbq chicken.. I would dare to say that it's one of the best bbq pizzas out there! Of course, they have great selection and all but one of the pizzas are sure to amaze (sorry, but I'm not a fan of the buffalo).  None the less, Joe's is simply amazing and Joe is a pretty good guy himself (he's in everyday at lunch). In fact when I told him it was my last time at Joe's due to a move he thanked me for \"being part of the family\" and gave me pizza on the house (told you I went there a lot lol)!"}
{"text":"My review is based off of a delivery order. I was staying at a hotel down the street and called around 11pm. I ordered a white pizza with pesto and chicken; came to $29 total. They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery but it only took 30. The pizza was delicious and had thick slices, just wish it was a little cheaper.  *White pizza means NO sauce, not white sauce like I thought. Add pesto if you want some kind of sauce :)"}
{"text":"NY style pizza, need I say more. It was very good pizza, though my family's choice of topping wasn't the best I would like to go back and have my own topping."}
{"text":"Pretty small joint, but being that they deliver, I suppose their focus isn't the dine-in experience. I found the pizza to be completely average and acceptable. When I eat NY style pizza, it's only one kind: pepperoni. I gauge every NYC pizza spot with the same starter slice. The crust texture was perfect, but the sauce and cheese were a bit bland. I ate here on the first night of a 9 night stay across the street, and never felt compelled to go back. Not saying it's bad, it's just rather ordinary."}
{"text":"Went in there for a slice for my daughter. Walked up to the counter and no one even acknowledged us. There were two people at the register and around 4 other employees in the area right behind them. It took 3 to 4 minutes before anyone asked if they could help. We got a slice of pepperoni and we had to ask them to take it out of the oven because honestly it was taking too long. My daughter loves pizza and we went in there for her but I am sad to say I will not be back because of their poor service."}
{"text":"These guys are probably the best pizza you will get in vegas that delivers. I usually just stop by and grab a slide to go. Its rather cheap for Vegas and its a good pizza. They deliver fast also."}
{"text":"Best Damn pizza in Vegas I've ever had! Not even a mile from the flamingo and right across the street from the hard rock. I had to wait to check into the westin and was craving a slice of real authentic pizza and by chance I found this little place. I got a mushroom and pep slice and a pepsi and it turned my whole day around. I had another whole pizza delivered later that night to our room however I wasnt as impressed with the lasagna pizza. But because of the earlier order this place still gets a 4"}
{"text":"This was awful. I'm. Ever one to complain. Order through door dash. Took 1 1/2 and was cold. The pizza was awful as well. Fingers were awful as well. Don't think I have had anything as terrible in a long time. Couldn't even eat it!"}
{"text":"I really love the white pizza pie from here. I remember when I used to work the late shift at work and I would come home at around 3:00 a.m. in the morning there would be only 1 or 2 restaurants in the area that were open. I'd always be so happy to order delivery from Joes. Even during a night out Joes was always open afterward. Great business. Will return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Liars. Sold us half a bottle of wine, 12 beers, and a pizza for 80 dollars promised  2 bottles of wine, and  24 beers. Hung up on me when I called them to talk about it :("}
{"text":"If you are looking for a slice of heaven come here.  Slices are huge and very tasty. Reasonable lunch specials."}
{"text":"Fugeddaboudit!!!!  This is the best slice of New York Pizza you can find outside of New York.  It's small and off the beaten path but the GREAT Pizza keeps me going back.  They have a lot of things to order other than pizza but I've only tried the pizza.  Once I find something I like, I stick with it.  Give it a try you'll be glad you did :)"}
{"text":"This is a place for lunch breaks.  The pizza's are pre cooked and heated when ordered.  I round the pizza to be decent but it's inconsistent.   One Guy burned mine a little and my friends was fine.  Decent price and sauce is kinda bland."}
{"text":"Stayed at hotel near joes pizza ... I got flyer at hotel when we checked in. Didn't pay much mind to it but Saturday when we got back to hotel...pizza sounded pretty good! It was bout 2:30 am, ordered \"the frat boy\" Greek pizza. I added yellow peppers and sausage. Also ordered hot wings. Service and food was GREAT! So delicious , hit the spot! I love that they deliver late, will definitely be ordering again on my upcoming trip."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for good pizza here in Vegas.  And I'm still looking......The pizza was good but not great.  It was fast and efficient delivery which is nice.  But the pizza wasn't balanced with an overabundance of cheese which fell off the pizza when we tried to take a slice.  We did like the sauce but the crust was too thick and a little doughy.  And lets not forget, the best test for good pizza is if its good for breakfast the next morning and this one wasn't.  It was good when fresh and quite filling.   Three stars as the staff was friendly and efficient, the location is great right outside the outlets, and the pizza fresh was average.  We would go back if in the area or possibly for delivery but there a ton of other pizza places to try!"}
{"text":"Late at night pizza is when I got here. 1,2,3 am in the morning this place hits the spot. I mean who doesn't like a late night slice or two?  I usually get the pepperoni and sausage or pepperoni and jalapeño slices. I like the thin sliced pizza and the flavor is good.   This place has some of the best ranch!! I love ranch on my pizza and they have good ranch.   I rated it 4 stars because the guys in the back are cool and always nice. They are quick and know how to deal with crowds whether nice or a little loose. The pizza I actually like and they also stay open super late.   It is a smaller place but they have outside seating which helps for the late night crowds. So if you have a huge group it might not be a good spot to go unless you take it with you. The prices are fairly reasonable too and not too crazy.   I will obviously be back and getting that ranch with the pizza."}
{"text":"Literally just left this place 2 minutes ago. I arrived famished with my wife and a group of 4 women waltz in and cut us in line, guy says to me \"you're going to have to wait, the ladies got here first.\" I don't know if the man did it because they were ladies but I thought it was very rude and showed that he either wasn't paying attention or simply didn't care. I'll take my money to Angelina's pizzeria where I'm sure I won't be treated this way."}
{"text":"joes has increased their prices and lowered their quality. I used to really enjoy their chicken fingers, but now they serve processed chicken tenders hardly better than McDonald's nuggets :( really disappointing"}
{"text":"Very good pizza by the slice.  It's located conveniently across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and is a perfect spot for a late night snack because it stays open well past midnight which makes this place a key spot when you've been to a concert at the Hard Rock.  The night I stopped by, the line moved quickly and the service was friendly.  There is plenty of seating, both inside and outside along the sidewalk, where they have additional tables."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave more stars.  I just can't.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm jaded from real NY or NJ pizza but this place is average at best.  I could live with average if I'm starving.  But the delivery is late EVERY single time.  And then my average pizza is simply cold, late average pizza.  And that's just not worth the $$ when your starving."}
{"text":"Before I start off saying something negative let me say something positive. I did have an amazing chicken Caesar salad. Other than that my experience was less than adequate and the meatball sandwich my mother ordered was the most horrible sandwich I have ever tasted. I'm Italian, so I really think that I can give a great review on Italian restaurant. You normally add breadcrumbs to meatballs as a binder however the meatball sub here should've been called a bread ball sub. Tasted as if this restaurant was so cheap they added no meat to the meatballs. The bread which is to soak up the sauce and hold together completely fell apart making my mother use a fork to eat her sandwich. The sauce was decent in the cheese was good but for the price absolutely terrible. Now on a positive note I'm sure they have amazing pizza. It looked good and it smell good and the patrons seems to be happy, However I can only go by my experience. A meatless,dry, under seasoned, broken sandwich doesn't make for a happy hungry Italian mother. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I expected a lot coming in here. Real NY attitude, RC Cola in a can, pizza looked amazing. For some odd reason I ordered chicken parm. Odder still, it came out on bread rather than pasta. I decided to take it to go and grab a Yoohoo on the way out, the cashier edited my ticket to include a $5 tip rather than ringing it out, thus messing up my expense report. Upon getting back to the hotel I was eager to tear into my food, which was terrible. Thrown into the trash, nothing good about it. They get 2 stars because the pizza looked amazing. I might give it a shot on my next trip for the pizza, but I do not know just yet."}
{"text":"What do you want when you and your friends are too drunk to drive, yet are starting to get HANGRY? Pizza. None other than pizza. And when it's past 11PM and all traditional pizza joints are closed, you start to get desperate.   We found Joe's through Yelp, because as many of you know, finding delivery past a certain hour in the confines of PV/Scottsdale is near impossible. But hey, we were surprised when we found out that Joe's was open until 4AM and delivers!   Not much to say, other than we ordered a pepperoni pizza and some wings. The delivery time was around 30 minutes which is beyond fair and reasonable for a non-franchised place that does late night deliveries. The delivery man did have a relatively hard time finding our home, but after a few phone conversations and us venturing outside to lure him to the right house, we made the money-for-pizza exchange.   The pizza itself was good. Not the greatest pizza I've ever had in my life but by far not the worst. They gave us extra sides of sauces (for the wings) and some ranch which was an added bonus. Let's be real, when the late-night drunken hunger strikes again, we will absolutely order from Joe's."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for pizza and wings, and wanted it delivered.  While there are many choices in town, Joe's New York Pizza is one of my favorites.  They have a hand tossed crust and the red sauce isn't spicy or have any odd variations.  Got a 16\" pizza, 16 wings, and an order of zucchini sticks.  Delivery was much faster than expected for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Seriously- the best NY style pizza. I've lived in vegas less then two months and eat there three times.  The entire crew Loves working there and always happy and helpful.  Treat u like family. Whether u eat in with the gooey cheese or delivery- it's just damn good. Thanks guys. I just had the award winning Gourmet Pepperoni-  awesome. You have my 2015 vote!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is okay, nothing to really write home about. The main reason to come to Joe's is you're 1) needing a quick/cheap lunch and work nearby or are 2) drunk. The staff is authentic to New York and by that I mean rude and condescending, but that has never stopped me from returning. The pizza is 3 stars, the price is 4 stars and the service is 2 stars, which provides the logic (when averaged) for my three star review.  Pro tip: come during lunch on a weekday, you get three slices for $6.50."}
{"text":"THESE PEOPLE ARE FREAKING RUDE ORDERED waited for 2 whole hours never received my order the guy on the phone is a dick DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE you will wait forever they answer and keep telling you the order is on it way and never show up deliver guy lies and says he came to your door ITS A WASTE TO ORDER TRY A BETTER PLACE"}
{"text":"After being in Vegas a week- my body naturally got use to eating later than usual so I was looking for a late night eat that wasn't fast food or $40 bucks because I screwed up my original plan. It's a 7 min walk across from the Hard Rock hotel on a street that one should jaywalk very carefully...  I didn't know if casino security was going to hassle Me for bringing in pizza so I walked it to My room discreetly.. I suggest you do so too. Delivery is $2.50 but tower elevator that require cards would of made it a pain if security had allowed them....  I ordered a 12 inch Greek pizza  but instead of feta I asked for ricotta( oil mozzerella oregano tomato). The staff had a great attitude.the place had a lot of pizza by the slice sitting out available.. Maybe that pizza is so so but the pizza I ordered made for me was stellar with good ingredients.   I ordered a few sides of marinara but they are generous so 2 instead of 3 will do...  Oh the place also has the 140 drink freestyle coke machine... I have heard of them and definitely enjoyed the cherry ginger ale."}
{"text":"I am from New York where pizza is king.  Joe's pizza is the closest to NY style pizza west of the Mississippi.   Crust and cheese is excellent.   Staff us as long friendly,  attentive and fin.  They have TVs so you can watch football too.  Worth the drive off the strip."}
{"text":"Visited Joe's NY Pizza for the first time because I had a $10 off coupon. Wow, so glad we checked this place out!! The pizza, calzone and wings were delicious!! We will definitely return for more!!"}
{"text":"I can't vouch for all of their Pizzas, which are quite numerous, or any of their appetizers, which are also numerous.  But I can say that last night, the greek pizza with added sausage was absolute perfection.  It was one of those pizza's that will break your willpower to stop eating until you are absolutely, undeniably and thoroughly stuffed.  Everything was perfect, the crust, the cheese, the saltiness, the parmesan.  My tongue is getting a boner right now just thinking of it.  TL;DR = Get the Greek with sausage.  You won't regret it"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars, I would.  I've ordered from this place before, and, other than a few mishaps, ud's been okay.  Tonight, though, I've been working in some projects, and u got hungry and decided to order, which ended up being a big mistake.  I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and Coke.  The meal is supposed to come with a small salad and garlic bread.  On the online order site, there's a place for special directions.  As usual, I wrote for the driver to please call when here, to NOT knock because it sets the dogs off, and even thanked them.  The order was supposed take 45 minutes to an hour, but, about 25 minutes later, there's a knock at my door and, of course, it sets the dogs off, and while I'm trying to separate them, I get bitten, and good.  All I got from the delivery guy was a quick \"sorry\" and, can you please sign here, even as my hand was dripping blood.  I even tipped the guy.  Then, I call to tell a manager what happened, and find out there's not a manager there.  The woman takes my number, and says she'll have somebody call me.  So, after cleaning the wounds the besti can and dressing them, I figure I'll at least go ahead and eat.  Why not?  I paid for it, right?  Guess what?  No salad.  So, again, I called back, got a guy who I had a difficult time understanding, who now says he's the manager.  He kept asking me, \"What do you want me to do for you?\"  He asked if they should come back and get the order or if they should bring me a new order, never addressing the bites fully.  He tells me that he asked the delivery driver who, I might add, has the same accent, and he says he was sorry.  I asked him what he thought he should do for me, and he wouldn't answer.  I hung up.  I will never, ever order from here again, and post this story everywhere I can.  I'm also contacting a lawyer...  Why have the question about special directions, if nobody's going to read them.  I'm think g this is neglect...  And I'm calling a lawyer.  Pay attention next time, and provide a little customer service every-once-in-awhile.."}
{"text":"Top level pizza. These guys don't mess around. Try the sausage pizza. Superb! Always will be my first choice."}
{"text":"Best ever!  Not only do they serve the best authentic New York style pizza but their spaghetti and meatballs and eggplant parmigiana are just like my Italian grandmother used to make.  Worth the wait if there is one!"}
{"text":"They renovated since my last visit pizza is still Amazing I've only ordered the Meat Pie on different occasions being here and I have not been disappointed, staff is friendly foods great what more can you ask for I make it a point to come here when I visit vegas don't pass this jewel up."}
{"text":"Was driving by on my lunch break and was looking for a bite, I saw the sign and decided it was cheat day and what a great way to cheat but by doing a Pizza.  It's been months and the Za gods were calling me!  I walked in to an almost full shop, love the decor and seemed very clean.    I walked to the ordering area and started to read the signs on what to order.  Tons of choices not just pizza a few salads to choose from, pasta, calzones, appetizers as well as many choices for pizza.  None of the prices were written down on the chalk board so as a newbie it made my ordering difficult.  Finally on the side wall I notice 4 lunch specials and all you can eat all with prices written down.  This was a cheat day but after noticing the size of the slices I decided to just wing it and order just one slice.  So I worked my way to the front and asked what a couple of the Zas were.  I don't know if I was taking to long but the girl wasn't friendly and seemed annoyed by my questions.   I choose the lasagna pizza, a light thin NY style pizza with a nice amount of zesty sauce pepperoni, sausage, mozzarella cheese and either a ricotta or cottage cheese on top.  The dough had a great flavor I even ate the crust and the whole thing was REALLY good!  When you just order lunch or by the slice it is pre made then run through one of the ovens I believe the oven was a wood fire not sure but it had a nice smokey flavor to it but I didn't want to bother the girl and ask.  I would definitely make it a do over, I took a star away for not having any prices written down makes it hard to decide what you want when you feel you may be holding the line up, and for the slight attitude from the worker.  I would certainly come back for the great Za though."}
{"text":"My husband had been bugging me to check this place out with him... his new favorite pizza place. Why does he like it so? Well, it's the huge foldable greasy pizza slices of course. I also enjoyed the pizza, great flavors in the sauce and good toppings however I'm more of a crispy crust type of gal.  This place is good for a quick lunch. They have several pre-made pizza's to choose from behind the counter... pick out your slices and then they add them to their ovens to warm and crisp them up a bit. It's affordable as well and very much a mom & pop type of place so if you like to support locally owned businesses give this place a try."}
{"text":"Good greasy pizza! decent price. Got 2 slices scooped off the tray (no waiting!) The guy was pretty nice to me & the other seemingly drunk people. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I appreciated the fact that it was open late at night and I could have a slice of NY pizza at 11:00 pm.  The crust was excellent and the sauce to cheese ratio was good.  My slice also came out piping hot, which was also a plus.  Two negatives were: the pizza was very salty and the price for one cheese slice with no toppings was $4.50.  I realize it's near the Strip and all but that's a bit steep for one slice of pizza.  The slice was slightly below average in size."}
{"text":"3rd time in for a slice and disappointed each time.  Single stale lukewarm pizza slice for nearly $6.00.  Pizza looks promising if you get a whole fresh pie. No idea what anything costs because prices aren't posted. Unlikely to return unless drunk."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings! Only complaint was I tried putting in an order an hour before they closed and the lady told me that they were really busy and probably couldn't take my order. It's either you can or you can't. When I pressed further she said they couldn't do it. I understand 15 minutes before but an hour? C'mon. The pizza is worth going back, but next time I'll order hours before closing."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but hit or miss customer service to the extreme. I've experienced  everywhere from amazing to experiences I can only describe as \"you're lucky your food is so good or I'd never come back.\"  I'll add an example: One time I walked in and no othere customers were there. They said they would be with me in a minute, which was fine, but during that minute some else came, someone else stood behind them etc forming a line back to the door. The same person came back, ignored me and after she had taken two other customers I walked to the place next door and ordered a sub."}
{"text":"Awesome food and quick delivery! Our hot panini sandwiches arrived hot and our cold sandwiches arrived cold!"}
{"text":"It was 2:30 a.m. and I had the most excellent idea to order pizza for everyone after partying the night away for NYE.  Being not from Scottsdale, I had no idea where to find pizza in the area so I went to my trusty Yelp app and found Joe's New York Pizza. They were open till 3 a.m. and it was 2:30 a.m...score! They also delivered...score! So I ordered three larger pepperoni pizzas for our gang and said they would be there in about 45 minutes. No biggie!  The pizzas arrived before we knew it and we quickly devoured them. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had but it did the job and soaked up all that alcohol, haha. It was pretty expensive for pizza but I wasn't going to complain about that, we were hungry!  Thanks for dealing with a bunch of drunkies at 2:30 a.m. Joe's NY Pizza...much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big pizza fan but this place is legit, best pizza in Vegas , you can't go wrong if you come in and they sell it by the slice , it's a must try"}
{"text":"Does not taste exactly like NY pizza.  Good try though. We ordered a slice.  They gave us a square pepperoni. They're definitely not from New York or New Jersey. The price for a slice is about the same as it is on the East Coast - $2.50. Hmmm... I rated this the same stars as the one I rated at Joe's in New York.      (If this is not the pizza joint in the same food court as Chipotle and Panda Express and under McDonald's, I'll gladly transfer this review to the correct listing.  3/19)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Legitimate NY Pizza in Arizona. Great crust, delicious sauce, tasty cheese and perfect texture. Great spot to frequent if you are a local, or if just visiting. I'm originally from NJ and know good pizza. Only reason not 5 stars is because their prices for a slice are slightly absurd ($4.00/slice). In the most expensive city in the world, in Times Square, pizza is $3 - $3.50 a slice.."}
{"text":"Just FYI to the employees, not everyone that comes here is drunk. I asked for 2 slices of pizza to go, which is extra. Got charged to go, but the pizza was put on dine in plates. Paid for ranch, but got none. When I told the guy that I paid for the pizza to be to go and for ranch, he just handed me the plate, said sorry, and that e water was free..thanks for my free tap water, however even their machine was broken so I couldn't even get my free tap water.   I'd go to Gus's pizza next door..they don't try to overcharge you for $2!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots and cheese pizza are pretty good and for a reasonable price too. I also like the fact that they are open late night. Comes in handy when you have those late night cravings."}
{"text":"Ordered this for delivery last night, they were SUPER quick and the pizza was fantastic. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, they charged my card for $40, I waited over an hour before I gave them a call just to find out they cancelled my order because they said the Las Vegas Blvd was \"closed\"? There are other streets in Las Vegas guys. Worst customer service I've ever heard of. Trust me I will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I just eat here. This place is old New York style and fast and affordable. I love the desserts here. :-)"}
{"text":"Joe's New York is one of the best pizza joints open late night in Old Town. My favorite go-to slice is the delicious white pizza with spinach and tomato! Yummy yummy for my tummy! After 2 a.m. there is a line, but it is well worth the wait and the staff is pretty great at getting all the drunkies orders in and out in impressive speed. The thin crust style is amazing and consistent with each pie. One can purchase slices or whole pies to enjoy in the compact seating area big enough for about 20 or so patrons or one can opt to find a spot outside on the curb or the short, random wall next to the store. I've never been here before 1 A.M., but apparently they are open for lunch and offer a variety of different Italian comfort foods then.  Besides the entertaining hot messes after 2 A.M. Joe's also offers: an ATM Machine, tiny cups for water, fifty cent fee for using cards, and grease, lots and lots of grease! Stumble on over the next time you need some food to help curb your hangover!"}
{"text":"My family and I ordered food from this place when they came to visit. While the food itself was actually not bad, my family and I were stunned with their idea of an italian sub. We are an Italian family, from New Jersey, and have eaten lots of amazing, delicious italian food and subs. Well... Joe's had NO IDEA how to make one. First, they asked if we wanted mustard on the sub....(ummm what? is this a joke?). After saying no, they seemed dumbfounded as to why we wouldn't. When the food finally arrived, we noticed that there was no oil or vinegar on the sub at all. They also used lots of pepperoni(which is also not in a real italian sub) to fill the roll. To be honest, we weren't even mad because it was funny that a place called \"Joe's New York Pizza\" couldn't even make a simple italian sub. Not sure if this was maybe a joke or a one-time mishap, but it was pretty ridiculous. I gave three stars, because like I said, the food is okay, just not authentic."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza with toppings can be found at Joes. I always enjoy great service, tasty food, and friendly staff when i visit. Tonight's veggie pizza was perfect."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and this is the best pizza I had ever had!!! The crest is to die for and the ingredients were extremely fresh! Great FOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with two of my friends and we decided to share a slice before we went to one of the local clubs.  We wanted to avoid having a food baby, which is why we shared.  We had the pepperoni and jalapeno slice.  I'm not crazy about anything too spicy so I removed the slices of jalapenos....my mouth and my lips were still on fire!  Don't get me wrong, I still liked it, but just make sure you have something to drink with you if you order what I ordered."}
{"text":"Quick deliver my to my hotel and the pepperoni pizza and side salad were delicious... will use again if in the area"}
{"text":"I called to make a pick up order. The person on the other end was great on taking the order. I ordered 3 large specialty pizzas and two salads. I arrived and the order was just about ready and the staff was very helpful to ensure I had salad dressings (4) that I ordered, asked if I needed plates, cheese, peppers. I got back to the office and every one was impressed with the size, quality but mostly the delicious taste! My favorite is the white pizza topped with freshly thin slice tomatoes! Now I know when I want a slice I can whip in on my way home to take-out. Yumm"}
{"text":"The meatball sub was recommended and didn't disappoint.  The service was fast, and friendly."}
{"text":"Las Vegas, zwei Uhr Nachmittags, ich bin komplett verkatert und auf der Suche nach Nahrung. Joes Pizzeria liegt gleich neben meinem Hotel und da wird nicht lang gefackelt sondern gleich mal eine ganze Pizza bestellt. Nach 15 Minuten Wartezeit kommt das Ding auf den Tisch und es ist gleich mal klar, dass es kein besseres Kateressen geben könnte, denn die Pizza sieht aus als wäre sie in Öl getränkt worden. Das Fett spritzt beim Reinbeisen richtig weg, aber es schmeckt wirklich einmalig. Ich mag amerikanische Pizza nicht wirklich, aber das muss eine der besten (und DIE ungesündeste) sein, die ich je hatte."}
{"text":"Mmm pizza is my absolute favorite food and this place completed my Vegas trip! We ordered the Hawaiian pizza and we ordered some other pizza with a lot of meat in it and bell peppers? . I forgot what it was called. The pizzas were huge, and 2 large pizzas were able to fill up 14 people. We also ordered wings and fries which were great as well. They have a big soda selection since it's one of those touch screen machines.  The pizza was real cheesy and had a lot of toppings  to the point where if you try to grab a slice, everything is going to topple over and make a huge mess where you pick up your toppings off the tray hahah I honestly don't mind this and it makes me excited to grab everything and place it back on my pizza.    Service was great as well although it wasn't really a restaurant. The ladies were nice and helped us throw away our empty plates, although I'm sure they wanted us to leave for other customers aude we did stay awhile. This place is real small which maybe 10 tables??"}
{"text":"Being from NY.. I wouldn't call this establishment \"New York Pizza\". The pizza was ok and the garlic knots lacked flavor. I also ordered the \"Italian Calzone\" but by the time I got back to the house and opened the box.. I discovered it was a Ham & Mozzarella calzone. Not what I ordered but it didn't taste bad. But, come on guys.. three items and only got two right. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I just downloaded Yelp and signed up specifically to share my latest experience with Joe's NY Pizza.    I enjoy their pizza and have been in the restaurant and have also had delivery service several times.  Today I placed an order at 12:30pm.  The expectation that was set with me was a delivery time of 45mins to 1hr.  After a little over an hour passed I called to check the status.  The employee who answered the phone immediately gave it to someone else who let me know the driver was going to be at the store in 5 minutes to pick up my order and that he should be at my house in 10-15mins.  After waiting 30 more minutes I called for another status.  Supposedly someone did not take my phone number or address correctly and the driver was trying to find my condo which they've been to at least 10 times for me before.  I don't understand why they didn't just look at the phone number that called to get all the customer information they have in their system.  I asked if they were going to deliver me cold food now or what?!  The guy on the phone said they'd make me a new order and get it to me in 30mins.  I asked if I was going to get a discount because of the negative customer experience that Joe's NY Pizza is giving me and also because I've now been waiting for over 2hrs for my food.  The guy on the phone said he'd give me a \"locals discount\" of THREE DOLLARS!  THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!  NOT COOL.  I've lived down the street of this place for over a year, ordered from this place several times, and now all of a sudden I'm getting a \"locals\" discount of $3 to make up for a shitty experience....c'mon man.  A major level of incompetence began as soon as I placed the order and for the management of Joe's NY Pizza to make me feel like this was my fault is simply rude.  After he said I'd get the \"locals\" discount of $3 (lolololol) I mentioned this was obviously not a good experience and that I was going to post a Yelp review.  He didn't care at all and said that my food would be delivered in 30 minutes.   Too bad they treat \"local\" repeat customers in a such a negative manner.  No apologies, no discount, and no accountability.  Really not cool at all and am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good pizza and it's very hard to find a good slice .   I stepped into this place about a 5 days ago , and it was made perfectly.   I just ordered by slice one pepperoni and cheese and very well cooked, the curst was very crispy like a chip.    Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place when we come to Vegas. The fries were great. Only place I eat New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Overall experience was just so-so. We got a tuna sandwich, cheese calzone, some fries and a slice of cheesecake delivered. They were over 30 minutes late past the time they promised. Why promise a specific time if you don't think you'll make it? Just give me a realistic range and I'll be happy. Promise a specific time and I'll think you're late for every minute you don't meet it. The fries were obviously old and had been reheated in a microwave and extra salt added on top of the original salt to hide the flavor. The calzone was fine and came with more marinara than any place I've had. Tuna sandwich came with a bonus salad I wasn't expecting. The sandwich was fairly small though for the price though. Cheesecake was the kind you buy from the supermarket, nothing fancy. Being open this late and able to make deliveries is good, but the price vs quality vs timeliness makes me question if I'll use them again."}
{"text":"Joe's Pizza is always good when I come thru, which is about once every 2 -3 months but hey, It's pizza how can you not like it."}
{"text":"Have to say, amazing customer service. Our delivery order wasn't correct. I called, no hassle. No issue. No problem. They corrected it made us a fresh pie and brought it right away. Very very yummy pizza."}
{"text":"You know the Soup Nazi, now meet Joe, the Pizza Nazi.    Dude, it was your choice to open a pizza joint in the middle of the second most pretentious city known to man and keep it open til the wee hours of the night, not mine.  Learn some tolerance.    Get drunk enough to ignore Joe before you get in there (which most people do without realizing it anyway) and stumble into Joe's after the bar.  Its open late and has the best pizza in town.    Thin, huge slices with all the regular fixin's...  Oh and garlic bread knots with ranch and marinara.  Its all ready to go so theres not a wait once you actually get in there...and what line there is outside usually moves pretty fast.    I have no idea what the prices are because I'm either too drunk to notice or the chach in front of me didnt realize that he just paid for mine.  You taking notes here?    Just remember to keep your orders to the point and be polite when you get to the front of the line....they may not let you use the bathroom (and you know you'll have to go) if you dont.  :)"}
{"text":"I can't give it any less than 5 stars because I've probably eaten here a hundred times. It's always good, consistent, fast, inexpensive, and comes with the right amount of grease like a real NY slice should. One time I let myself get a little crazy and tried the Hawaiian pizza (which normally I'd say is blasphemous and downright farce in a sense... I don't recall so it must have been good. The one big miss is that they're obviously Yankee fans, and I'm from the Mets camp.  Just kidding, anything other than the Cubs are OK in my book. Thank god this isn't a Chicago \"pizza\" joint."}
{"text":"A variety of pizza options. They have topping combinations i would have never even imagined were possible. Amazing customer service, very friendly and willing to work with your custom order :]"}
{"text":"After a disappointing and failed attempt to find Mexican food in Scottsdale, my friend and I ended up ordering online from Joe's. It was probably one of the worst pepperoni pizzas I have ever eaten in my life. Cardboard \"deep dish\" crust, flavourless sauce, watery cheese - it tasted worse than frozen pizza. I would not order from here in the future."}
{"text":"Roselina you are so sweet-thank you so much for your excellent customer service The pizza is delicious and I will be back before I head back home :)"}
{"text":"If you like huge crusts then this place is for you, got more crust than pizza. But pizza is really good best in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had pizza delivered to my hotel.  I ordered the veggie pizza.   All ingredients fresh with crushed garlic.   I Recommended to my coworkers as an option if they were planning to stay in for the evening.   Fast delivery.  They said 40-60 minutes but it was not that long.  Good pizza."}
{"text":"This place totally surprised me. I've seen Joe's many times at UNLV and figured it was just.. pizza by the slice for students and tourists. I would never have thought about it again but my mom saw a delivery car recently and suggested it when we were craving pizza.   We ordered a 20\" pizza (\"humongous\", and it is). Half white spinach and half Grandee Pepperoni with garlic knots for good measure. Three of us finished about half of it. The slices could easily be cut again in half but I guess that's New York pizza! It was greasy as expected but my goodness was it good. The white spinach was for me, and I really enjoyed the earthiness of the spinach. The crust was perfect: thin and floppy at the bottom, blistered and crispy at the crust. There was plenty of ricotta to make every bite flavorful as well.   I had a few bites of the Grandee Pepperoni, apparently an award winner from 2015. It has deep fried pepperoni bites on it which gives it a nice crunch in the middle of all that greasy, saucy pepperoni. Loved the red peppers as well: they're thinly sliced rings which are hot and juicy. The garlic knots were fine, not my favorite and a little too burnt/hard for me. It didn't really matter though because I am so happy to add a third pizzeria option in the area (Naked City, Metro). Speaking of those other two, the prices here are comparable to them so i don't mind paying more for good quality. If you're looking for solid New York pizza this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Fresh-tasting sauce...not like crappy canned/ jar sauce...healthy amount of garlic on the knots...great pizza...staff represented NY authentically --- friendly, but no muss-no fuss --- our visit was worth our while.  Full of quality ingredients that brought full flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered the meat pie pizza last night for a hefty $42.00. I expected something amazingly delicious for the exorbitant price tag but when my pizza arrived (awesome delivery by the way), I was quite confounded. My pizza was basically a slightly oversized Domino's pizza. \"New York Pizza\"??? I thought to myself. Shocked? Slightly. Surprised? Certainly! Once again I was reminded of the pizza conundrum: people do NOT know what New York pizza is. Not to sound elitist but I am actually from New York so I feel allowed to put my two cents in here. Joe's New York Pizza, I suggest a job-related trip! New York pizza has dense, chewy, but THIN crust. The sauce is rich and tomatoey. Cheese abundant but not excessive. Toppings ON TOP of cheese, not under a dairy fire blanket of mozzarella that chokes out the deliciousness beneath. Overall I appreciate the attempt but this is not New York Pizza. Crust is fat, floppy, and airy, and as for the flavor, sauce is reminiscent of Ragu, a sin that has sent many an Italian grandmother to a premature grave. Good luck Vegas on finding some real NY pizza at a good price. Took the gamble at Joe's New York Pizza and lost more than just $42.00."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Pizza was 4/5 and decor is nice but I was shocked by the price. Ordered 2 slices and it was close to $13. As good as it was and as friendly the staff is I just can't justify paying that much for just couple slices of pizza."}
{"text":"Great staff and there aren't any places better for a slice and one more beer while partying in Old Town."}
{"text":"Ahhhh yes...Joe's.  It's the classic \"eat me because you're drunk and need a cheap meal\" pizza. Cheap and reliable...tasty AND greasy enough to do the job. If you've been gettin inebriated and twerking your heart out in Old Town...you've been to Joe's.   Not a bad spot for a quick lunch either...on your cheat day of course."}
{"text":"I should have read some of these reviews before placing an order with this place. My husband and I are visiting from out of state and decided we wanted late night pizza. We ordered our food at 10:00 and 50 minutes later we got a call from the place asking where the pizza was to be delivered. Five minutes later our delivery driver called us and told us he was in the parking lot and there was no parking available so we would have to go down and grab the pizza from him (if we wanted to do that we wouldn't have ordered pizza for delivery). When we went down no one was there, we called the guy back and he told us he was at the wrong building. We cancelled the order, they lack communication and I don't think they understand English much either. Frustrating, would have loved to give them a try but will not now nor will we recommend this place to anyone. Sucky service, lady on the phone was rude!"}
{"text":"Decided to make my own pizza.....a pepperoni and cheese 19 inch is 20 bucks....expensive.....then I added 4 toppings and extra cheese....45 bucks!!!!!.....and the sad thing is...the extra cheese was never added it seemed like there was barely any cheese at all....the pizza was OK....nothing to brag about.... I have had much better pizza for almost half the price at another \"new York\" pizza place.....and remember just because the owner came from there......doesn't mean they know how to make a pizza....and if you ask for well done like I did.....forget about it....it was soft and flimsy...and I asked for thin crust....they have no idea how to make a thin crust.....corporate companies do better than this.....not worth the money when you have had better in town....."}
{"text":"I've been here before but didn't check in. This place rivals NYC or Jersey pizza. Excellent"}
{"text":"I actually don't remember being here, had I had too much to drink I wonder...?  I don't eat pizza, so I wasn't actually a paying customer here, but my friends seemed to enjoy themselves (or so I heard afterwards), and I will say this...it's in a super convenient location and has super convenient hours of operation!  I would totally stumble my way back here again. ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza at 2am (because, Vegas). Had a bit of a wait but nothing crazy. Driver was courteous, pizza and pretzel bites were both very good. Would definitely order from here again (although I don't want to go back to Vegas for a long, long time)."}
{"text":"Brain dead employees can't remember anything. If you plan on ordering a custom pizza just forget it. They can't keep two thoughts in their brain at one time. Don't even bother. If you want to order pizza by the slice this is a great place. Anything else is frustrating."}
{"text":"SPECTACULAR! Hands down this has GOT to be one of the best pizzas I've ever had!! I am an extreme fanatic when it comes to pizza!! I have found the pizza gold mine here in Las Vegas! Yes GOD! So long story short I was a really bad boy and decided to cheat on my diet! It was after midnight I was slightly drunk and Pizza Hut/Papa Johns all them were closed and not delivering! I thought to myself where in the hell can I get pizza I was craving bad! Low and behold I use the good ole YELP ad and it suggest this place was less than a mile AND delivered to the MGM signature! Looked at the menu online and saw that the prices were high so this must be some quality pizza! After drooling from the previous pictures posted from my fellow YELPERS! I placed an online order for the \"Humongous Meat Pie\" ($41.45 plus tax and delivery $47.31) I thought to myself wtf did I order but the hell with it! They called me 2 mins later to confirm if I really placed the order! 45 minutes later o was delivered one of the most fattening greasy cheesiest pizzas I've ever had! $50 for a pizza?! Sheesh why not! Would I buy it again? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza, and excellent service. Some of the best pizza in vegas!!!!! They have pizza by the slice,  tons of choices.  Pasta, chicken. Wings and sandwiches.  Really a great place.they close at 9 would  be nice if they were open longer... delicious ..."}
{"text":"Reminded me a bit of Z Pizza.  Pizza was modest, just cheese & pepperoni but it was big! Wings were good and came exactly as we ordered, baked with bbq sauce on the side.  Totally worth the price.  I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Horrible and rude customer service. Tried to lie to me on the phone about an order. Don't even bother with them."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have found here in Las Vegas!! How could you not love a place that is open til 3/4 am and not love it!! But seriously...the best pizza by the slice in Vegas and at good prices!! My favorites are The Meat Lovers and The Buffalo Chicken Pizza!! There salads are awesome and the chicken wings can be made many different ways...Cajun being the best!! If you are there on a Sunday afternoon you are bound to run into the hilarious and inebriated crowd left over from Rehab at Hard Rock that is across the street!! What is better than dinner and a show for one low price!! :-)"}
{"text":"Great service! Great pizza! We called yesterday, to ask for delivery today at precisely 11am for an office party of 16 people  (Howard Hughes Pkwy area).  Miguel, was very helpful on the phone and fun to talk with - and he made a point to tell me we should really be sure to try them because they have \"the best pizza in Las Vegas\".  He was right - it was delicious!    We ordered the Humungous Meat Pie (it's huge!), and the Tomato, Garlic, Basil pizza - both were very good.   The Buffalo salad was great too! And the Zeppoles were a nice sweet treat to have after eating the pizza.   Miguel delivered the pizza to us himself (on time!) - and he was just as fun and friendly in person.   Overall I would certainly rate them at the top of my list of \"best pizza in Las Vegas\" :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza was HUGE, but very good. The garden salad was awesome too."}
{"text":"Excellent service pizza was good so where the chicken wings. Really liked the barbecue chicken wings"}
{"text":"For a late night drunk crowd, Joes deserves a shout out! Fast awesome service every Time after old town bars. Security on busy nights Excellent pizza Good prices   I love Joe's.   If you live in the area, I highly recommend at any hour!  Inside seating always accommodating even of line is intimidating.  I look forward to Joes pizza every time after a night out in Old Town Scottsdale.  Hot fresh slices!!!NY STYLE"}
{"text":"This place has really, really fresh pizza. I didn't really know fresh til I came here. I got the combination and every ingredient tasted like it was fresh from the store. The dough was crunchy, the sauce was mild yet flavorful... It was perfect. I tried the other pizza, tomato and basil, and it was good as well. A little skimpy on toppings but still good.   After getting the pizza we decided to try the chicken alfredo. It was mild yet very seasoned. When I say mild I mean it's not too heavy on cream and butter, even though I think there's no such thing as too much butter or cream! For a light pasta, I really enjoyed it. There was so much chicken in there that the dish was actually heavy. I wish I could find this good of a value in LA!   I really like the decor. The tablecloth looks like newspaper and they have old school brands on the walls. There's nice pictures everywhere and even a Statue of Liberty! Very unique decor.   The bad? The customer service could be better. I've never gotten amazing service in Vegas so I don't know if it's the area, but I'm used to a little more friendliness. The prices could also be a little better. I understand this is premium pizza, and it's good and fresh, but $4 is a little high for Vegas. I expect better prices since this place is a ways away from the strip.   The whole pizza is a good buy compared to the slices. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area because finding good pizza in any city is a rare find"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend walked into Joe's New York pizza just out of curiosity while waiting for our taxi to pick us up. We were pleasantly surprised to see that they offered more than the typical pepperoni pizza. Joe's had an assortment of unique pizza options, which you could view through the glass display they had set up. The cashier was very friendly and explained all the different options and gave his recommendations. My boyfriend and I did not plan on eating pizza that day, but once we laid eyes on their meat pie, we knew we had to get a slice! It was not the best slice of pizza I have had, but it was something I had never tried or heard of before! Basically it was cheese pizza filled with spaghetti!!Overall, the meat pie was very good and satisfying.One slice is all you need to fill up!"}
{"text":"We called for delivery at about 2:00am after a night out so I can't vouch for my own sobriety but, from what I can remember, this pizza was awesome! We ordered a double pepperoni, double cheese with cheese sticks and it was delivered in about 30 mins. Next time I am in Vegas, I will try it sober and see how it stacks up!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, we had high expectations for this place and it did not deliver. We ordered a 16\" pepperoni, which was $30 but we figured it would be better than other pizza...it was served super hot, with no way of plating it onto the flimsy, paper plates, which led to cheese and sauce getting everywhere. The sauce tasted like sauce that comes with pizza making kits at the grocery store. The place we go to, by our house, sells a better and bigger pizza for $12. Sorry, Joe. Maybe try harder to make eating your pies a little easier."}
{"text":"My husband has been a fan of Joe's in the past so we ordered a cheese pizza. It was awful! Even my kids couldn't eat it. It tasted like a reheated frozen pizza. The taste was awful and it was so hard to chew. We had to throw it away! We ordered a Greek salad which was ok but it had a huge tape ball attached to the bag! It was gross!"}
{"text":"Delish pizza. Super big slices. You better be hungry. Thin crust, soft. Worth the price"}
{"text":"I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!!  I was born and raised in New York City and I know New York style pizza.  This place brings my taste buds home every time I eat there.  I have been going to Joe's for years and love the pizza there.    Sad to say I have never tried anything else from the menu.  I know they have sandwiches and pastas and stuff but when I find something I like, I stick with it.  If you want a slice of heaven....Then go to Joe's"}
{"text":"Really great pizza right across the street from the Hard Rock, which is great for a quick bite after a concert (or to line the stomach for a night of drinking) By the slice or pie with crazy combos and names. Totally cheap, great for the baller on a budget!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch.  I've always gotten pizza.  Not blown away by the pizzas, but they aren't bad either.  I would definitely say it is a decent place to have lunch.  Affordable prices and good portions.  For me, this place is pretty average.  It does get pretty busy during lunch, so I'd recommend coming early or going late, or else you may have to wait a while to get your food."}
{"text":"I like this place....other than their prices.      The pizza is good, but not good enough to be worth $30/pie.  I like that we can just get a slice, but it is just too expensive to bring my family here.    I had the lasagna pizza and it was awesome!    Also, I have to say their wings are some of the best I have had in vegas...and the BEST Bleu Cheese Dressing!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Joe's NY is very good! I almost couldn't finish the two slices I ordered, but the great taste got me through all the way to the delicious crust. I've had the calzones here too, and it was very filling and very tasty. It's big food so come with an empty stomach. You WILL be satisified, and not disappointed."}
{"text":"Apparently even if you are a board certified physician you get treated like an uneducated thug if you are a minority here.... Completely terrible service. Just because it's late and the majority of people are drunk is not an excuse to treat people like the S word...."}
{"text":"For a Chicago girl this pizza was pretty good!!  We may even order delivery later on in the week!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast!! Ordered a pizza last night with sausage, cheese and fresh basil.. the baked the fucking basil so it turned black and nasty.. the sausage tasted like it was on the verge of spoiling, very gamy!! Plus the older woman behind the counter was not pleasant at all.. where is the old man, I miss his surly service and his killer pies!"}
{"text":"I work in Old Town Scottsdale and we order pizza from Joe's probably more than we really should.  I'm pretty sure no one truly needs that much pizza.  Joe's takes great care of us, however, which is why we keep ordering more and more pizza.  They have true NY style pizza, dripping with grease and deliciousness.  I don't ever want to know how many calories are in one of their pizzas!  If you're looking for a snooty upscale pizza place, this is not the place for you.  If you're looking for some pretty awesome pizza delivered on time, call Joe's!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating a couple of slices from Joe's, and let me tell you: They were amazing! If you don't like grease, I suggest that you don't go there. However: If you are a college student like me who only cares about what the food actually tastes like and not if it's healthy, then by all means find the nearest transportation and go, go, go!!!  I ordered the Joe's Favorite which consists of cheese, pepperoni, and bacon. The crust was soft, the slices were huge, and they were also easily foldable, so that the toppings didn't fall off!  Plus: It was delicious!! The bacon in no way overwhelms the flavor of the pepperoni. In fact: I don't know what kind of pepperoni they use, but it was like POW! Pepperoni Explosion!!! Sailing along on a boat of cheese with a zesty tomato sauce undercurrent.  I loved it, and I went despite all of the negative reviews that I read online. (Some of these people don't seem like the type that have ever eaten cold leftover pizza for breakfast.)  So my fellow college brethren, THIS is the pizza for you! To all of the fine-dining connoisseurs out there I say - Don't ruin it for the rest of us normal people!  Delicious, delicious!! I think I may eat another slice! ^_^  P.S. I got the 16-inch pizza, haven't tried their \"pizza-by-the-slice\" yet. P.P.S. They were playing Journey when I walked in! JOURNEY!!!! That sealed the deal for me!"}
{"text":"5.89 for a slice that has been sitting all day- old looking and did not even heat it up completely!! Crust was soggy! Spent over 20.00 for 3 slices and a am drink! Horrible taste!!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"It is a bit scary when you walk in and see the old pizza sitting there.  It feels like it has been there for more than a day.  But when you order it up and they heat it up in their oven, the magic comes alive.  By the time it is thrown on a plate heading for my belly you completely forget its almost wax like pre-oven state!  Great ingredients, funny attitudes of the people who work there and some funky signs to keep your attention during the wait. Goods."}
{"text":"How's the New York I can confidently say that this definitely is not New York styled Pizza. Sometimes I wish people used the label because it takes away from what they are doing. So they have a great product the food is tasty but it gives the wrong idea what you're looking at have. I had a cheese pizza and the sauce was savory. The crust was crispy and the cheese was was ooowee gooey. They have a small staff and they're very personable the young lady who was working recognizing my my voice. I literally said about 5 words to her and she said oh my gosh I forgot the cheese pizza. We joked for about 3 minutes on recognizing each other because she was the only female working at the time. I think a really good plus to this restaurant as that is across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. So if you're looking to save a little money and get some great food you can just walk Rush Street get your food and go right back up to your room."}
{"text":"I tried this pizza for the very first time and I truly can say it's the best pizza I had in a long time. It beats out that famous Chicago style pizza on the strip. Over 5 star rating for me. You gotta try it. 24hours slices of pizza on the spot  You can't beat that"}
{"text":"Best pizza joint in town!  With awesome costumer service and military discount!   This is the only pizza place that we go too for good quality New York style pizza!"}
{"text":"Perfect NY style Pizza the way it should be. Cheesy, greasy, with a nice crispy crust. My new go-to pizza spot."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite pizza in Vegas. My usual order: A slice of the Italian Pie (it has spaghetti inside, people), and a small caeser salad. YUM."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place late night in vegas per the cab drivers recommendations. We got 4 slices (1 for Leroy the cab driver) and the sugared donut bites. Omg those things were amazing. Idk if it was the vodka sodas or the warmth that made us not be able to stop eating them. They were melt in the mouth delicious. We also got a buff chicken pizza, an extreme and then a florentine. All were super delicious. My only complaint is that it was super pricey. Otherwise it hit the spot."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place but now I am just disappointed.  I came in a few days ago after a meeting with some friends from UNLV.. Coming in I noticed that the prices had gone up. You can easily spend over 10bux on 2 slices and a drink, but thats ok cause they have pizza here they don't have anywhere else.   I ordered a lasagna and pepperoni sausage, while my friends ordered Hawaiian (yuck imo) and a few other kinds. I also got a side of ranch which costs 50 cents. I do not understand why some places charge for ranch, I mean their pizza is already so expensive that you think they could afford to give away a tiny container of ranch for 50 cents. Maybe its because everybody asks for it and it gets expensive but really? I am already spending 10bucks, why not throw in a ranch? /endrant  Anyways we get the pizza and it is just mush. The pizza is soggy and soft. I asked them if they could make it crispier but I really think they put it in the microwave to spite me. This place used to be awesome, but now its just a quick 24hr stop by if your hungry. I'd recommend the Pizzaeria at Cosmo any day over this place."}
{"text":"Great drunchie spot. Better pizza than Gus', but also longer line, typically."}
{"text":"I had ordered delivery because of my business near by and having my special needs daughter with me it takes a lot to get her in the car and back and forth so. I had ordered online to make sure my order was not messed up. Well I got my food, and they forgot my spinach on my pizza and they also did not have my salad dressing. When I had called to,let them know at 1st the lady on the phone told me there was NO spinach on the order, I had told her I am looking on my ONLINE receipt that tells me there is and was CHARGED for it. She muted the phone and made it right to offer me a free meal next time. Pretty good food but did not care to be told I did not order something on a pizza when CLEARLY it was stated on my ONLINE receipt. ?"}
{"text":"Crispy thin crust with flavor in the toppings that are extremely delicious. It's usually quick and easy to get a  couple of slices.  They also have whole pizzas and beverages galore. Indoor seating is nice when the weather is foul."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day.  I was going to go with a sandwich but the pizza in the window looked too good to pass up.  I actually went away from my usual cheese and went with one meat pizza slice and one pepper and onion slice.  Both were delicious - not too greasy, thick crust pizza.  Pizza was cooked in about 10 minutes.  Overall, it's a nice slice of pizza.  I usually compare all pizza I eat to New York style.  I still have not found the true New York slice in Las Vegas, and I'm not sure it exists, but Joe's is not too far off.  The prices are not cheap but not expensive - you could easily eat a nice lunch for under $10 at this restaurant.  I think there are still many more pizza places to try so I would not outright say this is a must stop for tourists, but it is solid if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I have order from this place before and the pizza was never bad, I don't know if was the type of pizza I ordered which was the bbq chicken pizza but I will never order it again, the chicken was over cooked the sauce on the pizza was dry it was by far very bland. I don't know if they have new cooks but that pizza was not good at all. If you plan on ordering from here I would just stick with the pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"I used the Yelp app to make my order and get it delivered, unfortunately it was not delivered. Waste of time... How can an app Sell something that they cant control. After two hour of waiting for my delivery it had to be cancelled. 1-Food was cold 2- the Merchant supposedly had 20 issues before delivering my food. 3- they had there ovens off and to make my order again they had to put them on so that was approx 45 minutes more. To end this, 2 people were left sitting and with hunger and Eats (Yelp) want to surprisingly give me a $2 coupon code, witch i think is worthless.  1- A taxi to get food rounndtrip is 20-30 bucks  2- food is $40 for 2 persons   3- the waste of time lack of respect is not worth $2.... plus i cant tell who is lying when the merchant said one story to me and Eats told me anlther story supposedly stating what the Merchant told them.  It really sucks!"}
{"text":"Very cute decor inside. Bread was very good  on the Italian but a little dry could use some dressing. The spaghetti was a good size and the pizza was very good."}
{"text":"Ordered pasta with meatballs. Taste was so bland and crappy I couldn't finish it. Tasted like store bought."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! Delicious food. Awesome staff and delivery guys. I have a severe food allergy and these guys were amazing at catering to my allergy and getting me food that I was able to eat. That was beyond exceptional!!!   Their star Staff member Lee, the first night that I was in Vegas was great at handling my order and my allergy.   The second night we ordered with them, they were faster than expected when they delivered our food. Next time I am in Vegas I am definitely ordering with these guys again.  Their Pizza is not exactly like New York pizza but it's pretty darn good. My favorite was the white truffle mushroom pizza it was so amazing and definitely award-winning."}
{"text":"Pretty good slices open super late. This is my go to pizza spot if I get the munchies at like 2 o'clock in the morning. The staff here is cool. Sometimes if you go there very late there's a bunch of drunks hanging around but they are just funny to watch. Been there done that, for now I'll just watch lol. I always get the pepperoni with the mushroom solid slice"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from this place twice while I was in Scottsdale. Good pie for being in Arizona. Definitely recommend the place!!"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery service, great experience! The food arrived as expected, the small size manhattan pizza, 10pcs of wings and antipasto salad was fresh and delicious. I would definitely order with them again next time if we're in town and want fast and fresh food.   *** Sorry I forgot to post pics, we were too hungry."}
{"text":"The pizza was great we ordered a large pepperoni and chicken tenders. The chicken tenders aren't great,they are more like nugget processed chicken as opposed to all white breast meat tenders. The cannoli was great, the cheesecake was pretty good with strawberry syrup. For what we spent I expected better. Delivery guy was great and they came faster than the expected delivery time."}
{"text":"I don't want to do too detailed a review on this because it's a pretty simple pizzeria.  I think it's NY Style so you get large slices of pizza but it's not your typical thin crust.  Lots of different toppings but nothing irregular.  Pizza tasted okay, not bad.  Nothing memorable.  Nothing I'd crave but I would eat it again if it was convenient.  I don't know, you're in Vegas.  The food game has to be stepped up when you're around all this other good food."}
{"text":"Excellent New York-style pizza! Great specials. And a friendly staff. Cool atmosphere, too! Am always going to come here when I'm in Vegas.  This is not my first time, but it is my first review. Pizza came out right from the oven hot and fresh. You can taste the Quality. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great walk in for a slice of pizza. Friendly atmosphere and generous size for the price."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The staff is akways friendly and outgoing and did I mention the pizza is delish as well?....well it is!"}
{"text":"I've dropped in a few times for just a slice and it's always terrible tasting. I don't think they put a time limit on how long they hold the per slice pizzas on display in the case. They are mostly dried up and tired looking. Even when heated up it doesn't help the cause. I like cold pizza and even when not heated it just tastes bad.  Maybe if you order a fresh pie and eat it there the food is good? I just come in for a slice to go and I have never been happy. A slice, drink and tip is $10 and just not good."}
{"text":"Definitely gross food. Don't know how dine in is, but carry out is terrible. Paid $30 for garbage"}
{"text":"From its creative menu, to its authentic and homey atmosphere, this is pizza at its best. Why go to New York when you can find it in Las Vegas. The staff is amazing and the subs are to die for. My friend ordered the meatball pizza and I almost died when I saw pasta In it. BOMB! Eat here, enjoy here. Thank you for such an amazing pizza spot to eat at."}
{"text":"It had been some time since I'd been to Joe's, and it was due to convenience.  Seeing as my job is now in the area, well, I get to visit this tasty pizza joint during lunch.  Having said that, I've been here for lunch and they have a pretty quick turnaround on orders. I order the lunch special which is two slices of pre-baked pizza with a small beverage (note the pre-baked pizza is baked that same day and reheated in the oven when the order is made) plus a side salad and it comes to about $8.50.  Considering how large these slices are and the fact that the soda fountain is available for free refills, this is pretty budget friendly.  I also thoroughly appreciate that there's garlic powder on the tables to add to your pizza, salads, or whatever else you may order.  All in all, an A-Ok place."}
{"text":"Pretty good NY style pizza place in a strip mall across the street from Hard Rock Casino. Not much NYC character to the sign or decor, but you can select from a decent selection of NY style slices which they heat up for you.  Had a really good slice of pepperoni and mushroom with very tasty sauce and ample mushrooms and pepperoni for $3.50.   Bottom line: If you are craving some NY pizza in Vegas, definitely a great option, esp if you are near Hard Rock. 4.25 stars."}
{"text":"I was with a large group of people and their service was awesome!! It was slow to start, but that's not their fault considering I think we had like 10-13 people with us but once they started to get things going, it just kept coming. So onto the food!  The spanish chorizo pizza had bits of chorizo on it and to me wasn't that special, but I'm also not a big fan of chorizo, but it was still good.  The stromboli no matter what you get is delicious, it's filled with the right amount of cheese, veggies, and meat with the right amount of dough that it was delicious and tough to put down to make room for other foods!  We got hungarian bread, which I believe is just fried dough with a light sour cream sauce that had garlic and some other seasonings that I couldn't make out, but the combination was phenomenal! I don't think I can have bread again without that sour cream sauce. It was super light so even if you don't like sour cream or think it's going to be overpowering, it wasn't.   Escargot pizza - well....it is what it is, snails on a pizza and I was VERY skeptical about trying it but I'm glad I did, it wasn't bad at all. My FIRST experience with escargot and I probably wouldn't order it on my own, but it is definitely something you must try at least once!   We also had pepperoni which was good, but it's pepperoni nothing special with that.  And dessert was homemade zeppolis with cinammon sugar AND powdered sugar, you have to get both on them! Not one or the other, but both! They are delicious, just be careful when you get them, since they come out HOT!"}
{"text":"Pizza was a little overdone but delicious. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Desert is awesome. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"It was another dinner in a pinch evening and this time we just got the pepperoni pizza. It was wonderful and reheated beautifully (microwave and then put in the over at 350 for about 7-10 min). GO JOE!"}
{"text":"This was a rare night that I got to actually meet up with my man and have a bite to eat (its convention season, spring break and March Madness...so we are a bit busy at work). I was CRAVING Joe's pepperoni pizza, large ranch and a rootbeer...so he graciously obliged (he saw the hunger in my eyes and who doesn't love late night pizza?). It was just what I needed to unwind from a crazy night . It was perfectly soft and crispy at the same time and their ranch is unparalleled. I was a supremely happy camper plus it was nice to get to be with the ones you adore. Thank you Joe's for making my night much better."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a few friends on our last night in town based off of local reviews and not exactly what I was expecting. Arrived probably 30m before closing to find an employee already cleaning and closing down the lobby area down. We asked if they were closing now, and he said no. Cute establishment The cashier was nice, but did get one of our orders completely wrong.  While waiting the lobby was still actively being closed down, so much for not getting comfortable with chairs being stacked around you.   Now to the food.  I ordered the chicken ranch calzone added some bacon...sad to say chicken was  lacking flavor and a little dry despite the amount of marinara sauce provided.  The size of the calzone was good. My other parties were 50/50 on meals but all agree good proportion size but once again one order was completely wrong so good enough to say that it was a good try for a last minute effort but we probably won't be returning on our next trip :("}
{"text":"I got two vegetarian slices with mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and black olives. They were thin slices like I'd get at Joe's in the West village in NY. Not quite as delicious, but pretty good and enjoyable for NY style pizza in Arizona. I'll be back for another quick lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings delivered to our hotel in a reasonable amount of time. The jalapeño poppers were good also."}
{"text":"Since the new owners took over last year, this place has received a facelift in interior design, while still keeping the same delicious pizza and friendly service!!! I stop by every time I am going out in old town on the weekends, plus other times when I am in the area. (There is always a long line in the weekends after midnight. They stay open every day until 4am). The pizza and the service have always been great. It has way better pizza than most other pizzerias I have tried in the Phoenix metro area. This is the go-to place in old town Scottsdale. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Food was great! We went there two days in a row during our visit in Vegas! I got the Garlic Knots without Parmesan cheese and it was so good! Definitely going here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Slow service, burnt, greasy limp French fries and burnt pre-cooked pizza."}
{"text":"Just by chance, I walked in to Joes Pizza by the Outlet mall and immediately could smell the aroma of great pizza.  The place was clean and adorned with signs with whitty sayings.  They had various pizzas already made (for by the slice purchase).  I ordered a single slice of cheese pizza so I could get to taste the sauce and crust.  The crust was thin, just the was it should be.  Very good flavor and it passed the \"fold test\".  Other items on the menu sounded very appetizing.  Can't wait to get back to the Outlet mall to try there calzones."}
{"text":"Not listed on their menu is the Spaghetti Meat Pie. You MUST try it! Once you eat pizza from here, you won't settle for anything less!"}
{"text":"So the last couple times I have eaten at Joe's within the last 6 months or so I have been sorely dissapointed.  It used to be my husband's and I's favorite pizza spot around and we went there all the time.  They must have changed ingredients or lowered the quality of them, as their pizza is just not as good as it used to be.  Just regular old mediocre pizza now."}
{"text":"Beware if you use a credit card this place WILL DOUBLE CHARGE your card! The very first time I ordered they said my card wouldn't go through , I called my bank and they said my card was fine. Called Joes back and they said it's declined. So at that point I was tired and left it alone. Next day I wake up to see a charge on my account from joes pizza! Apparently my card did go through and I never got my pizza! I called my bank got it cleared. I figured it was s mistake.   Last night I decided to try them out once again. Not only did the pizza make my family and I very nauseous but I woke up to have two charges from them!!! I called them and spoke to JULIE the manager. She explained to me that this has happened to a few clients and doesn't know why and she would have the owner call me. The OWNER  called 20 minutes later making excuses as to why this would happen. He continued to say all of this was impossible to happen because it didn't show on his end and said he needed the \"truth\". I explained that I already disputed the charges with my bank and maybe that's why it wasn't showing up . He asked to see my bank statements!!! Because I wasn't telling him the truth. He also said ANY ORDER YOU PLACE WITH A CREDIT CARD WILL BE PRE AUTHORIZED for the same amount in his restaurant.   In the end my bank resolved the issues of course but I  only called them to let them know there's an issue in their system they need to resolve and I got a rude call from the owner calling me a liar! Don't order here. Save yourself a headache and try another place!"}
{"text":"It's not bad.  Not the best pizza in town.  It is good in a pinch and I would recommend if you are in the area.  I would not really go out of my way for it though, to be honest.  The staff was friendly enough."}
{"text":"First off, the service is pretty good. The guys were very nice and helpful. I ordered some Garlic Knots, which were very tasty. However, I came inside to check in on the knots and saw the gentalmen that was doing the finishing touches on them using his bare hands to put the parmesan on the top. Now I am kind of picky about stuff like that, so that's why one star was taken away. Other than that, their pizza was pretty amazing, the dough was a little thin, but overall great quality."}
{"text":"Even when you're not intoxicated this pizza is amazing. I'm a ranch connoisseur and I give their ranch five stars"}
{"text":"We ordered half Hawaiian half Chix bacon ranch. The guy taking the order over the phone had some trouble. We asked for no BBQ sauce but it came with. The pizza was large, bursting with flavor and tasted fresh. I wouldn't call this true NY pizza however.. The crust was pretty doughy and not traditional thin and crispy. The prices were decent. A good value right off the strip."}
{"text":"This is really good pizza. Great staff and friendly service. My only gripe is I wish they would cut the pizza better. When try to grab a slice, it's not cut completely and I pic up the whole pizza half with it. Aside from that, this is the best pizza in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recent trip to Vegas. Unfortunately, I can honestly say this is the worst pizza and wings I've ever had. I don't like to post bad reviews unless the service or the product was extraordinarily bad. In this case the service was okay but the food was TERRIBLE everything was super dry and tasted really old. Normally Yelp is pretty reliable for helping us find decent food wherever we are but not in this case. I'm only posting because I wouldn't want another hungry family to be as disappointed by this terrible food as we were."}
{"text":"Time for an update and a bump in star rating too...  It was my daughter's second birthday and we celebrated our house on a Sunday evening.  I put out appetizers and made a couple of salads, but how can you host approximately 20 people and not serve pizza for a kid's birthday party?!    I used the Eat 24 App and ordered that afternoon.  I love the feature that you can select a later delivery time.  I selected 5pm and ordered the following: -Vegetable Pizza + eggplant (highly recommend adding that eggplant; it was awesome!) -Meat Pizza -Plain Thin Crust 20\" Pizza -40 Wings - (Buffalo style with ranch)  I was able to add tip to my order when I placed it so I didn't have to worry about tipping the delivery guy.  Everything arrived on time and hot... and was demolished by my guests.  I had a slice and more than a few wings as well, and it was worth the calorie splurge for sure!  So, bottom line is that Joe's is great for lunch, for delivery, and for late night bites as well.  I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just received our delicious piping hot pizza from Joe's New York Pizza. From the polite order taker on the phone to the fast delivery (both by Chris) my family and I were very happy we ordered from Joe's. We ordered a \"gigantic\" size half veggie and half frat boy pizza. When our order arrived it was upgraded to \"humongous\" size at no extra cost! What more can you ask for?! We will definitely order from Joe's again."}
{"text":"its OK. the last time i was in there i got chicken wings and fries. the Fry's were burned and the wings were OK. not impressed the food... time to get some tums..."}
{"text":"The quality is quite good. The people are friendly and service is quick. However, $25 for a 16\" thin crust pizza is just too money regardless of the toppings.  We've bought several pizza from here and their salads are fresh and have quality toppings. The drawback is that you can get a comparable pizza for $17 elsewhere."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW, WOW, I've never been to NY, but I love this pizza!  We ordered for work, wanted something different than the regular pizza places.  Wow the choices, and it was delish!  I had to go back after work to pick up a pizza for my husband.  Even he was impressed.  Love it, Visitors, not far from the strip, and they do deliver!  Check it out/!  6/1/12 update I called my order in, they said it would be ready in 20 min.  Cool perfect timing.  So when I get there, I guess my pizza stuck to the pan, and they had to make me a new one.  They offered me a free soda, then brought me 1/2 of the pizza that they messed up (well the good part) The guy that was making the pizza was so sweet, I wish I would have gotten his name.  They really appreciate there customers #Ilovethisplace"}
{"text":"I love their Pizza but the web site will make you wish for Papa Johns,  It is a mess, after having to download an app that I don't want. and jumping through a bunch of hoops the web page crashed, so you do it again right, Same results.  Haven't been back for 3 months.  No interest"}
{"text":"OMG!! The best food ever! I am so picky about my chicken fettuccine, but let me tell you it was absolutely the best I have ever had!! The chicken was amazingly crisp and sauce was very tasteful. We had this meal delivered to our hotel along with the garlic cheesy bread which everything was to my expectations!!! Would highly recommend everyone to give this meal a try.. will not disappoint!!'"}
{"text":"As you walk into the door of Joe's New York Pizza, you are greeted with a sign that suggests Joe has received awards for the past 3 years for his pizza. What king of moron gives those things out anyway?  There is one Yelper, who admits she is not a fan of pizza, but says she liked the flavor. This actually makes sense, someone who doesn't like pizza might actually like one that has no flavor what-so-ever.  This is probably the blandest pizza dough I have ever tasted. Just plain blah.  I could not taste the sauce at all, though it was not due to the bland crust or overwhelmed by the toppings, it was just poor sauce and very little of it.  I won't say it was bad pizza, just slightly below average (somewhere below papa johns pizza and somewhere above my Norwegian grandmother's pizza).   The reason the place can't even make 2 stars is due to 2 parts - 1 - the very poor attitude of the woman who served me at the counter and; 2 - the OUTRAGEOUS price for 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink ($14 - AYFKM?), puts this place just below crap in my book.   This place is probably kept open by an endless flux of intoxicated Hard Rockers thinking this place must be good because the sign on the door says so. Of course, they don't stick around Vegas long enough to regret their decision as I did.  Perhaps there was a time when this place served good New York pizza, but it certainly doesn't anymore. The poor quality of the food and the poor service suggest the place is barely staying open.   I wish there was a sign that we could place on the doors of establishments that said: \"We're Cutting Quality to Maximize Profits! GFY if you don't like it.\" - it would certainly be more useful."}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times in five days!   It has been great for our family of seven (5 kids-  12 and under).   Great pizza and excellent subs.   Garlic knots are a family favorite.  Lisa the new manager has been super friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Fresh....fresh...fresh!  The salad was crisp and tasty. The pizza was crisp, soft, and the flavors were perfect. Now the chicken alfredo *wipes a tear* was fantastic! This was fresh, not jarred sauce and the flavors were spot on.  Customer service was fantastic and we will definitely order again.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My daughter said they have the Best Spaghetti and meatballs. We ordered to go. Extremely polite and professional staff. Great ambiance in the dining room. Tall guy expediting the orders packaged our food. He was very nice. I'll definitely be a regular.  About the food, absolutely delicious. They have a caprese sub. Hopefully, they add a caprese salad to the menu in future. Apparently, they deliver on grub hub too. Sweet."}
{"text":"Pizza is solid and good selection.  PRICES ARE INSANE.  Two slices and a drink was $11 or $12.  This is an offense to anyone who has ever been to NYC.  No reciept.  Kinda silly."}
{"text":"First time trying Joe's NY Pizza tonight. We ordered the White Truffle Pizza minus the sun dried tomatoes because they were out, and they gladly offered a substitute which was very thoughtful. We added wings and they were spicy and delicious. The only thing that wasn't good were the \"baked potato\" fries. They came with absolutely nothing on them, just plain ole French fries???? Very disappointed in that. Will definitely try this place again, just maybe not the baked potato fries."}
{"text":"Let me say it was late on a Saturday and didn't feel like paying for parking in the area so went back to the hotel and pulled up pizza places nearby that deliver ! Thankfully joes pulled up and ordered a calzone w mushroom and Mac n cheese! Where do I begin that the Taste of the cheese magnificent and the delivery time was in a half hour on a Saturday night! S thanks for making me choose best place to eat that delivers in old town !"}
{"text":"Fun place to stop for a really good pizza. A lot to  choose from. They had many pizza that are ready for you to buy by the slice or order a whole pizza. We had half  truffle, mushroom and bacon with white sauce and half pepperoni . Service was friendly and the ingredients where fresh. Definitely will make this a stopped the next time we visit."}
{"text":"I come here each time I come the Vegas and it's been good every time.   They have always had multiple pizzas ready and the service has been fast and good. The specialty pizza with goat cheese is bomb!  They also have one of those CocaCola machines with like 100 different drinks!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious and walking distance from my hotel. I can't ask for much more. Maybe beer and delivery. The pizza was solid. Great ingredients, great flavor, good crust. Lots of slice for the money. Ridiculous size in fact. I wish I had one on my corner, I'd probably have two good asses."}
{"text":"This place saved my wallet in Vegas! Glad that it was right across the street from the Hard Rock because its fast, easy and cheap!"}
{"text":"Ordered Meaty Gigantic and Cheesy breadsticks.  Pizza is huge and filling after1 or 2 slices, not overwhelmed with toppings but hardy.  Cheesy breadsticks are huge and super filling and cheesy.  We had it delivered to our hotel. Came to the building and took about 30 mins. It was Hot off the oven which was a huge plus and friendly delivery guy!  Definitely will be ordering again on our next visit!"}
{"text":"The special they have going on about free garlic knots is a lie. We ordered over 20$ of food and apparently the girl taking our order never got us saying \"free garlic knots\" emphisis on the \"free\" multiple times we told her, reading and saying we saw this offer here on YELP. We are not local, so we only ordered here because of the \"offer\" they were saying here on yelp. Total lie guys. The delivery guy said to refer him for tomorrow but we wont be here tomorrow. Horrible lying advertisment here guys. Dont believe it; disappointing and upset."}
{"text":"joes pizza is the place to go if you're looking for a calm delicious place to go eat, me and my friends come here whenever we have a chance, come check it out !!!"}
{"text":"Check them out on Ch 5's Dirty Dining 11/7/13. You be the judge."}
{"text":"This place is located across the street from Hard Rock Hotel. We weren't all that hungry since we had an enormous breakfast earlier in the day, but I new that I would be out late (early AM) for a GNR show, so we decided to get a slice here. The ambiance is very modest. There are maybe 5-6 tables, plastic forks and knives, serve yourself drinks, you get the picture. The pizza was just ok, not terrible, but certainly nothing to rave about. $15 for 3 slices, one cheese, one pepperoni, and one meat combo. The best thing was the thin crust. Other than that the toppings and pizza in general were just average. There are, however, entertaining posters on the walls that are worth a look."}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge recommended Joe's NY Pizza since we arrived so late at night. It was an excellent choice. Delivery was timely and the driver was very cordial. He showed us our order to ensure it was correct before leaving. Even gave us plates and cups. Nice touch since we were at a hotel.   Now the food! We got a Grandee Pepperoni and OMG best pizza we've had in a long while! That pizza was so tasty! Definitely recommend. And the wings were not bad either."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out after all the reviews ... We ordered the meat pie & it looked delicious!!! After taking about two bites the overwhelming saltiness over took me! The dough is amazing!!! But I do not recommend ordering the meat pie ~ Staff friendly .. People seemed to be locals or people escaping the strip .. More then likely will not be returning.. Super expensive .. $35 for a large pizza & $2 for a small drink"}
{"text":"Just ordered a simple cheese pizza and garlic knots because I had a coupon from Amazon Restaurant delivery service. Ordering through Amazon was fast and easy, but the pizza arrived luke warm, almost cold, so not even the cheese stretched when biting into it. It was taken out of the warmer or never placed in one so it didn't stay hot on arrival. The garlic knots were over cooked, some pieces almost burnt and they were hard to chew because they too were not hot on arrival. Very dissatisfied with the food. Although I will probably use Amazon again, I will never order from Joe's NY Pizza again. I've had N.Y. pizza and they should be ashamed comparing themselves to it."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas you should probably head over to Joe's and check it out. VERY GOOD New York style pizza.   I like that you can order pizza by the slice and that they are super big. You only need 1 or 2 slices in order to be really satisfied. The only downside that I can see is the staff. Not very nice. I mean, it's NY style pizza, so that sort of comes with the territory, but it would be nice if they'd pay a little closer attention to what you're saying. They take your order and then just sort of say \"pepperoni\" when it's ready. Anybody could really just walk up and take your slice. Not a great system.  However, the food is great. Check out this great slice of pizza just off the strip!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special with this pizza.  Ingredients were sparse each something as inexpensive as green peppers.  The cabresa salad was drenched in balsamic oil with less than ripe tomatoes."}
{"text":"Used to like coming here for pizza all the time. Went last night and was told they don't do slices at night- only full pizzas. Hmmmm... The name of your place is Joe's Pizza By The Slice, but you don't do by-the-slice at night. And to top it off the employees acted like this is something I should have known when I expressed surprise.  To conclude, Joe's Pizza By The Slice does not sell slices at night. You figure that one out... Maybe at night they can darken the part of their sign that says \"by the slice\" so they're not misleading customers."}
{"text":"Worst service ever pizza never arrived. Don't order here. Waited for more than one and half hour. The lady on the phone was so rude she even hang up the phone."}
{"text":"Closest thing to NY pizza I've had in AZ.  Owner knows what she's doing. Keep it up Joes, thanks for restoring hope for NY pizza out here."}
{"text":"Not happy with the pizza.  To begin with I got the delivery which was a mistake.  Gave them easy directions to get into the complex, of course they did not listen.  Said about 35 minutes, took an hour.  Cheese was stuck to the box lid and the pizza was not even warm.  Not that the price was an issue, but for a cold pizza, it was not worth it at all.  It was as if they used very little cheese, barely had 2 pepperoni's per slice, if lucky.  I was trying a different pizza place, because our neighborhood place is closed on Monday and I wanted a Non-National chain pizza.  I should've just just gone to Hungry Howie's.  Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I've had in years. I stopped by here after dropping a friend off at UNLV and decided to give it a shot. Best decision ever. Pizza was just like back in NY. Many claim to have NY style pizza but Joe's nails it. Big slices you need to fold to eat, that nice crunch of the crust and sauce is amazing. Will definitely be back and recommend everyone to come."}
{"text":"Called Joe's (at 10:45am) and ordered a pizza slice, calzone and some soda for a worker and I. The manager told me that it would be 30 minutes (when looking on the map Joe's was a 6 minute walk from where we were working except we couldn't leave to go sit down there). At 11:49am we get a call from the driver asking where we were. Upon talking to him further we figured out his location (which was not close) and he said he would be there in 10 minutes. At 12:21pm I finally called Joe's and cancelled my order. As I hang up the delivery driver shows up and gives us the food. I told him I wasn't paying for it and he said he was sorry. We threw the food away and continued working. At 2:05pm we finished working and I called Joe's to make sure I was not getting charged and was informed that the Owner said since I accepted the food he was not refunding my money. This is a disgusting statement made by an owner and he/she should be ashamed of this type of practice. I suggest if you are looking for pizza to go somewhere where your business is actually appreciated. Clearly my business wasn't. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great friendly service, best pizza in Las Vegas! Recommend to all who come to town and to all my friends."}
{"text":"Needed some late night drunk pizza. Joe's was there for me, better crust, toppings, and sauce than a chain could offer. Quick delivery, friendly staff. Confirmed pizza before leaving, would recommend over Apollos or Sicilys. Stayed at the Mardi Gras Hotel for reference."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something. I grew up in New York, I know what a good Italian restaurant brings to the table. Since I've moved to Vegas, I haven't found a good Pizza joint..... Until now. The Authentic style of preparation is on point, not to mention the overall taste. Their chef's are on the top of my list. Oh yeah, not to mention they're super fast and honest. Usually get my order within 30 mins, no bullshit."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza in town! I go there minimum once a week. My friends love it and it's  the go to place when I want to have some great pizza. The staff is awesome. The yummiest pizza there is! Check it out you will not be disappointed... they need one in Henderson:-)"}
{"text":"I had their chicken Alfredo and it was delish.  Only problem is they wanted to charge the delivery fee 3 times because I asked to split the check.  Same address just 3 different orders.  Boo... No complaints otherwise though.  #satisfiedsoul"}
{"text":"My husband and I drove 40 minutes to try this place for the first time. Let me tell you something...it was worth every damn minute of drive time. This is the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. Great location next to some other popular night life spots! My husband is from New Jersey and said it's the closest thing to NY pizza as it gets."}
{"text":"This hits the spot! Crust is spot on: slightly crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. It's more on the spendy side if you're used to Pizza Hut and Domino's but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick pizza lunch this is the place! Not too many places in Las Vegas offer pizza by the slice, if your looking for that this is the place. The garlic knots are a must get, everything is pretty good here. A go if you can!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I had a loyalty card that I had been saving for over a year and the manager would not accept it because he claimed the stamps were from a stamp he didn't use. I had never seen him there before but he claimed that \"in all the time I have worked here, we have never used this stamp.\" I will never go back again, have already posted about this to my over 500 Facebook friends, and will contact their corporate office with my complaint. How dare they imply that I had been lying with my stamp card. What losers. The pizza's not even that great. Greasy and dry."}
{"text":"Got the garlic knots at almost 2 am this weekend and they were heaven. They were a couple inches big and so cute. The outside was crisp and the inside was slightly doughy, exactly how I like it. PERFECT garlic knots. Will never get them anywhere else. Got the meat pie again. Didn't disappoint; still amazing.  LOVE that these guys are open so late. THANK YOU for your long hours!"}
{"text":"Good late night spot for some pizza after hitting up the clubs in Old Town. We came here after going out this weekend for some good old fashion late night food. There was a constant flow of people coming and leaving. They have a good selection of pizzas ready to heat up and serve to you. I dont know if this is a place Id go to on the regular but its definitely the late night joint.  Also, I thought it was kind of interesting because there was a cop standing inside the restaurant keeping an eye on things. I assume things can get rowdy in a place like this considering that everyone there after the bars is pretty sauced. I guess it's the norm but not something Im used to seeing."}
{"text":"I have a couple friends that swear by this place, but a few others and I think it's just okay. It's not the cleanest, but then pizza places normally aren't.  The other day I got a Grilled Chicken Parmesan sandwich, but it was fairly tasteless with bland red sauce and cheese. The pizza is okay, but nothing to go out of the way for. I think I got spoiled with real Neapolitan pizza in Italy - no comparison. However, their Italian Combo sandwich may be their best offering.   I don't want to knock it for people who like NY pizza, but Joe's is low on my list."}
{"text":"Date of Visit: 1/8/2016  Time: 7:41 pm  Small strip mall pizza joint that bills itself as New York pizza and has won the Best of Las Vegas 2013, 2014, and 2015 in the category of \"Best Traditional & Non Traditional Pizza.\" But don't be fooled by the awards...   I'm giving it 3 stars vs 5 stars because it's not horrible and most people would like it. Although, I debated giving it 2 stars....  This pizza wasn't to my taste. I prefer a spicier sauce vs a sweet sauce and a crispy crust or at least one that's cooked...   I love New York pizza. Give me a good hard crust, the harder the better and I'm a happy woman.   But Joe's couldn't deliver. Instead I got a crust that was limp and flaccid.   Apparently you have to ask for well done or your pizza is barely cooked. Have eaten lots of New York pizza but not once have I had to ask them to cook it.  Ordering is assembly style where one person takes the order and another rings it up.   The menu is extensive but there are no prices for slices. And that's where you get burned when you order 2 or more slices.   A slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni cost $8.70 with tax. No drink, just 2 slices of pie. Say what?  For a few bucks more you can buy a 12\" cheese pizza.  There's a self serve all-you-can-drink fancy soda machine.  Communal seating with a single table for two by the door, table for four, two bar height tables for six and a long wraparound booth with three tables.  Would I go back? No. It wasn't the worst pizza, but I like a sauce with bite and crisp crust. I'd rather eat something I enjoy than eating just to eat. If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a sandwich from CVS."}
{"text":"Found the joint on Yelp and stopped in for some lunch.  I was hungry, so I ordered:  2 Slices of Cheese Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=DLRrNqxUOi4C-ZruqGljlA 1 Slice of Tomato Basil Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=DK3o6jLbbW2Ot3ZSAxZ7lQ  It's touted as a New York Style Pizza joint and it is....the Pizza is thin crust and you must fold to eat!  Otherwise the Pizza bends down.... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=obcx6HaVezeOz9Duw6_sTw  I thought the Cheese Pizza slices were a solid 4 Stars.  They had a nice flavor to them and weren't greasy at all.  However, the Tomato Basil Pizza was not good....2 Stars at best.  The Tomatoes didn't have much flavor and tasted a little \"off\".....was not happy with that choice.  Total damage was around $8 and it included a bottle of Water.  Not bad for 3 Slices.  Next time, I order just Cheese slices.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Another stop on the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, I've had this place bookmarked since last year's Pizza Bender Tour.  I was eager to finally get to try it out.  I asked for 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but the girl behind the counter told me that all they had was what was in front of me.....wow, this was the first time I've been told that I couldn't customize my Slice order from a Pizza joint.  OK, so I browsed the available Pizza Pies and decided to order three Slices:  Pepperoni & Jalapeno http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=kfLqk6iyi4eYWlLz45uuPw Meat Pie (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Ham, Meatball, on a Double Crust) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=69kV9XIlg2VoR8DTHSuqng Super Meaty (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=9-R9RYbmNcXlysJbumdR9g  The total damage was 14.38 for 3 slices.....which seems like a lot to me, but  I couldn't see the per Slice price anywhere on the hand written menu.....so I just paid the bill and moved on.  It was lunch time (around 12 pm) and it was beginning to get really busy, so I quickly jumped on an open table near the door.  I asked for my Slices to be \"well done\", so it took a few extra minutes to heat them up.  It didn't take too long before I was called.  Once I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!  The first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw I liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.  Next up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg The Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be \"well done\".  Last but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=Gx_4cQ3K4pBUBY6L9974aQ  Overall, I really enjoyed the Pizza here at Joe's.  However, I thought the prices were a bit high compared to other Pizza joints in Vegas.  I guess being so close to the Strip is a big factor.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Service is quick and ordering online is easy. Delivery was fast as well. The food satisfied cravings. Good alternative when you are two blocks off the strip and don't want to leave your hotel/resort."}
{"text":"Very close to the Hyatt Place where we stayed at. We just walked there to get exercise. The pizza was great and HOT, but tasted so fresh. HIGHLY recommend their garlic knots. They taste just like heaven. Before you take a bite out of the garlic knot, be prepared for garlic butter to splash all over the place."}
{"text":"Hands down thee best place in town to grab a late-night slice without breaking the bank. It's nearly 3am, and my pizza-lovin' belly is so happy! Joe's has an awesome variety of topping combos to choose from that are ready in minutes.  The real jewel of this place is the salads, though. The Greek is my absolute fave. It's honestly enough for 2 with the container bursting at the seams with fresh veggies & cheese for days. Even the dressing is bomb. Not sure if they make it in house or what, but I'm a fan.  Easy walk from Hard Rock & convenient drive if you're already on Paradise."}
{"text":"Took home the most delicious white pizza since living here in AZ. (Mozzarella & ricotta) Could have used a bit of chopped spinach in the ricotta but I'm used to the Bx pizzerias. Still pretty good for AZ. Had the same NYC feel."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but very pricey and they always mess up our order. We have stopped ordering due to the aggravation. Is nice that they are open very late."}
{"text":"Joe's is the best pizza I've ever had. My fiancé and I went 3 times in a row when we were in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in one week, and both times I had a consistently good piece of pizza. It is no secret that pizza is one of my favorite foods, but what I have recently discovered is, I may have converted from a Chicago style lover to NYC style lover, could it be old age? Who knows....I didn't come in with any expectations, but I was hungry, so I ordered 2 slices, one Hawaiian (my favorite) and one lasagna (yes, lasagna pizza) there were about 8 different types of pizza to choose from, which were all pre-made, and then ran through oven to warm them up. I was surprised how good they tasted for being pre made, they weren't greasy either. Props for having ranch dressing too. They also have sandwiches and salads.   I gave a solid 3 stars, I can't give pre made pizza 4 or 5 stars, because it can't go up against the likes of Metro pizza or Dom's, but I can see this place being busy on late nights after all the drunks stumble out of the Hard Rock looking for food."}
{"text":"Clean, good atmosphere, and a good slice of pie. I come to Vegas once a month and since discovering Joe's I try to hit it every other visit. One slice is almost enough for the average eater, and I can put down some pizza."}
{"text":"Placed an online order using Grubhub, called just after the order was scheduled to be delivered and was assured the order was on its way. Called 45 minutes later, and were told they thought they had made the order but they actually hadn't made the order. Whoops... we asked for the order to be canceled but they didn't cancel it. So we had to call grubhub to cancel the order. Shady, shady business practices at this place."}
{"text":"Pizza take out tonight. Had a BOGO from the Entertainment Book to use.  Got the garden salad with creamy Italian, a small super meaty pizza, and a small lasagna pizza.  Everything tasted good and pick up was very convenient."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is the best pizza Scottsdale can offer! My husband and I always stop by after we go out or get it delivered - either way you'll get a perfect New York style slice. Plain cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here for my dads 45th birthday great service But there was this girl that couldn't stop stealing the Hi-C and another couple that kept making out and there is no way they would last a week he was clearly trying to get in her pants. Also styrofoam cups are not good for the environment but I have hope in you guys in changing your ways."}
{"text":"New York style pizza by the slice, with several options ready to be thrown into the oven. What else could you ask for...  Wtih the addition of  a friendly staff, comfortable environment and great location - two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Had Joe's food many times.  Mainly take out and delivery.  I have to say the pasta is some of the best in Las Vegas and I'm comparing it to some of the best Italian restaurants in town.  Pizza is really great if you like a thin NY crust.  Hand made with REAL ingredients WITH AN EMPHASIS ON REAL CHEEEEEEESSSSSSEEEE.     Let's not forget the sauce: simply fabulous: tip: order extra sauce!  This is not a Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesars etc.  and thank God!  Delivery: Only takes 20-40 min.  Drivers are clean, pleasant and seem to actually care about what they do.  Give them a great TIP if you use delivery.    Restaurant is small, simple and clean.  Quick service from people who give a %$# about the food they serve.  Not far from Strip, across street from Hard Rock.    Definitely worth the trip or delivery."}
{"text":"I had two positive moments when eating here for the first time. My first positive moment was the friendly staff, quick to serve and ready to work. My second and last positive moment was how clean their restroom and dining area was being kept up, very nice. Sadly I paid $12 for two slices of pepperoni pizza and a small drink. The pizza was greasy, burnt and almost inedible. If I wasn't already in a hurry i would have asked for my money back. I will never be returning to an establishment where one I paid for the cost of almost an entire pie and two where the pizza was burnt. .sad I was hoping for a quick stop pizza place to eat at while I work on the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Absolutely delicious pizza and made with soul.  I've never had a pizza taste that freaking good and definitely a step up from Pizza Hut or Domino's!!  The dough they use to make there pizzas is fresh and handmade.  You can tell by the quality of the texture when you bite into the pizza.  I was somewhat confused on how to order, but luckily there was signs to tell you what to do.  Will definitely come back and have bookmarked this place!"}
{"text":"Walked in this place is super tiny. But it had quite a few people in it.   I will say I had 4 people ask if I had been helped which was awesome customer service! I walked in and ordered two slices of cheese right away.   While I was waiting for them to put my pizza in the oven, I paid for my order with a credit card while reading the sign saying we card everyone if you are paying with card. The girl did not ask for my ID and there was no one behind me. So she wasn't rushed just didn't feel like doing her job well. I got two cheese slices and a soda. She gave me the combo price. Put the receipt and pen on the counter and walked away didn't even hand me my drink cup or say thank you. It's ok I can do it myself. I only worked in the hospitality industry for 10 years. You had one job, seriously a 10 year old could do it.   I encounter 5 people the first four excellent customer service the last one rude and ungrateful for my business. I live near by and I think my money might be appreciated else where.   Now to the pizza. They say it authentic Italian New York pizza. I'm a believer in a pizza is truly good if you don't have to add toppings. Meaning the crust is good, the sauce is flavorful and the cheese is good real cheese. If it's good just plain adding toppings just adds not masks the flavors. The crust was good the sauce lacked that classic Italian flavor and basically it just tasted like old pizza put in the oven. Which exactly is what it is.   So basically if NY pizza tastes like it came from the mall's food court then I'm not a fan.  Definitely not the best pizza in town. Probably just a tourist trap to get everyone from Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from Joe's.  I have never eaten there before but the reviews seemed good however, I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, absolutely terrible.  I had been craving them and literally couldn't even force myself to eat more than three bites.  The sauce was watery and bland and the poor little meatballs looked burnt on top of the fact that they were tasteless, had a weird processed texture and for some bizarre reason were cut in half.  Gross.  The garlic knots were soaked in grease .  I'm not talking about yummy garlic buttereyness but more if you melted half a stick of margerine and topped it off with a generous dose of vegetable oil.  The delivery service itself was good and their online ordering system was easy to follow however, the quality of the food was so poor I will definitely never order from them again."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight when I found out Mr. Lucky's got rid of their AYCE prime rib special.  I had a slice of the lasagna pizza for just under $5.  Pretty tasty, and the guy Robert behind the counter was super friendly and was enjoying his night.  Hit the spot."}
{"text":"Looks great, smells delicious, will come back tomorrow to try other stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only been there when I'm hammered.  So sue me.    When I have gone to Joe's, it is VERY late night as the various clubs near Shoeman/Scottsdale begin to wind down, and this place has a huge line out the door every time.  The pizza, which is sold by the HUGE slice, is simply acceptable - not special, not delectable, not even excellent.....just acceptable.  For me, pizza starts with a great cheese, and the cheese here just seems so....bashas-like and ordinary, without that quality mouthfeel you get from cheese at places like Street of New York.      Of course, when you're binging after six drinks, \"acceptable\" has a funny way of becoming \"I must have it right now.\"  So I'm sure I'll go there in the future, but my expectations will be well calibrated -- This is drinking food, placed smack dab in a location that caters directly to people that have been drinking.  Buzzed or not, that long line can sure be annoying....."}
{"text":"I love your pizzas but let me tell you what happen! Your chicken wings we ordered for our valet team here at Elara hilton just threw away their portions! It was wayyyyyy to salty! We all ate one and started coughing! That's how salty it was! We didn't want to call or reorder due to the fact that we have a certain time frame for lunch! I'm sorry to put this out but we will still recommend Joe's pizza just for pizza and nothing else."}
{"text":"How much is good pizza worth? Is it worth being subjugated by a tyrranical owner slinging expensive pizza?   Maybe, but only if it's really good, which the pizza at Joe's happens to be. Decisions, decisions.   It smacks of the soup nazi in its unfortunate contradiction. If the pizza weren't so delicious, this would be a quick and decisively negative review. Sadly, for me the reviewer, for me the consumer, it isn't that easy.  My suggestion is to go during the day, before Joe is embittered by partiers and the lunch special is readily available."}
{"text":"This is THE best place for late night eats in the Old Town area of Scottsdale. Forget that phony cheesesteak place up the road. Joe's is where it's at! They are a true NY style thin crust pizza. Very delicious and many options for slices late at night as the bars are letting out. The lady that runs the place during those late night hours isn't the friendliest, but I wouldn't be either when I'm trying to get drunk assholes in and out as quickly as possible. Great pizza, good scene, great...pizza."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! But you need to work at it. Cause they don't understand their own advertisement."}
{"text":"Best late night pizza in old town. You can get by the slice or by the pie. Slices are HUGE. Best ranch dressing I've ever tried. What more to say? Go to Joe's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Joe's NY Pizza for years! We go to the original location on Paradise and frequently visit the Las Vegas Boulevard location. Love both spots and the people are also great too. We bring friends/family here all the time!   FOOD   My must-try items are the Grandee Pizza (award-winning pizza), White Truffle Mushroom, Hungarian Chicken Pizza, Garlic Knots, Chicken Wings (Voted Best in Las Vegas) with the Mango Habanero sauce and the Italian Panini. Depending on how hungry I am, I'll also throw in a dessert item. For parties, I cater from Joe's NY Pizza and I always get the biggest pizza size which each slice is bigger than the size of your head! Always get rave reviews on the food when I get catering through Joe's.   CUSTOMER SERVICE   Excellent! I can barely think of a time when they didn't treat us well. However, we are locals that frequent the place. But, I think when you're loyal to a place they should treat you well! Both locations also offer delivery within 5 miles so you can order pizza to your hotel if you'd like. Their delivery service is also excellent.   PRICE  I Joe's NY Pizza is fairly priced for what you get. The portions are big, food quality is high, service and location are awesome and you get a pizza stamp card so after X-amount of pizza orders you get a FREE one. You can also sign up for their VIP email list and get a coupon for free chicken wings. They always have great deals so just ask them when you go there. They'll always be ready to help you!   I love this place and will definitely come back here again!"}

{"text":"Mehhhh.  Maybe it's my fault (ok, it's completely my fault) for ordering the heat-attack slice from hell. Pepperoni, ham, sausage and bacon layered between bread and a hearty helping of cheese topped with more bacon, but it was a bit too much. Difficult to eat and just tasted like salty grease. I've eaten a meatlovers before but this slice....I don't know....it just didn't taste good. Which is saying alot because bad pizza is still pizza. I'll have to go back and try one of their less meatier slices."}
{"text":"This place is near the strip and across from UNLV, and it is really good. It sells pizza by the slice and by the pie, on top of pizza they have tasty salads and other yummy goodies such as chicken wings and garlic knots.  What I really enjoy is that 1) the pizza is just tasty, it is good pizza. The sizes are good, the ingredients are fresh and prices are not bad at all.  And 2) it's consistent. I really really dislike when I find a place I like and I go back and it's bad. I hate hit or miss places and Joe's is just not one of those. If I'm hungry for pizza and don't feel like searching for a new place or trying a new place I know I'll get my fill and pizza craving satisfied here.  Try the pizza here, try the other food, I doubt you'll regret it.  My favorites (I can't just pick one) are: Manhattan loaded Veggie"}
{"text":"if I could give this place another 1/2 star I would.  Late night after the clubs it is definitely good.  Reminds me so much of the NJ shore in the summer time when the bars close and their is the late night pizza rush.  It is quite site.  It definitely has a NY pizza feel to it to with the look.  Pizza is quite tasty and after the bars it is just about perfect.  2am...  Bar is closed...   I will be coming for you NY Joe."}
{"text":"Hey this for delivery service and rude grumpy driver. I think the pie would be good at the restaurant but don't order it to be delivered. Too many other choices that deliver hot pizza without an attitude. The driver actually had s problem with me because he couldn't find the address."}
{"text":"Late night we ordered pepperoni Sicilian pizza and it was very good. My husband doesn't like a whole lot of crust but I don't even think he noticed since it was simply delicious. It took them about 30 minutes to deliver but after a certain time you can only order a 20 inch pizza which was obviously a bit much for just the two of us. I understand since they probably don't want to be running pizza slices all over Scottsdale for intoxicated individuals. All in all, very good pizza."}
{"text":"Unbelievable when an owner or representative of the owner isn't here. I've been in food my whole life, this post should be a wake up call that the staff they have need a smack in the face. Gustav Mahler would never stand for this. The communication between the staff absolutely terrible. Blond guy counting money, not washing his hands before going to food. The girl at the front giving instructions to some dark haired guy with glasses who isn't listening, tables a mess... barely cleaned etc. Typical employees is why good businesses go out of business. I hate to see these type of people running a kitchen. I was going to let this go. Last time I was in there I had a piece of metal on one of my slices of pizza from a Brillo pad or from one of the oven scrapers I can't remember which. I said something to the girl and she was baffled. I just blew it off. I pretty much come here 2 to 3 times a week, the food is impeccable. This time the guy who was given instructions to heat up my pizza put it in there for about 45 seconds not enough to even get it hot. I wish there was something else I could say other than the employees need to take their foodservice job seriously.  I seriously hope JOE or his sister or the person who works her a** off cleans house. A reckoning needs to come for sure. My first review last year was a five all day!"}
{"text":"This place is really great if you're just looking for a delicious pizza you can order by the slice. I'm more of a pepperoni kind of person, but they do have a wide variety of toppings. According to the restaurant (it's posted everywhere), they were runners up for the best of Las Vegas for \"best non traditional pizza\". This place obviously has some street cred with the Las Vegas crowd. The location is a little out of the way for me, but it is in the center of town right off the strip so I guess there's not much to complain about! I definitely will be coming back to this place more often."}
{"text":"Drove to get a pizza They are not open  Why can you not post Correct operating hours   Go anywhere else and be happy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor management and terrible staff. I paid and tipped them for nothing. They lost my order, and the guy with piercings got mad at me for it. I asked for a refund and they never gave me the full refund because they lost the receipt. This place is made for drunk people only."}
{"text":"The staff here are unbelievably bad , they have no business working here, it makes me angry to think of all the unemployed people and then they hire these snot nosed kids to work here..they are polite to who they want to be and rude to others. Right in the middle of my order at the counter the girl walks away and starts working on other tasks for over five minutes!! Unreal!! I had to yell back at her to get her to come back over, the food wasn't anything special and tasted like I warmed it up in the microwave at home, not to mention it took over 20 minutes to get a sub sandwich and a slice of pizza. I was ashamed to be spending any of my time or money in this \"business\". They need to learn the meaning of treating ALL customers with respect."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizzas...they have chicken and sausage rolls too... Rarely see that around here"}
{"text":"I am not impressed and my food hasn't even arrived! My office put in an order a few days in advance and after the delivery was already late, I called to check in on where it was. The lady who picked up was NOT apologetic AT ALL and admitted that they hadn't even finished making our order yet. They should really plan accordingly, especially when orders are made in advance."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 1:14 am. Called at 2:46 to ask about my order. After being hung up on the lady calls me back to say the ticket never printed. Well if it never printed how do you know what my order was? If you can't handle late night delivery then don't offer it."}
{"text":"This pizza place is a jewel in the rough they make some of the best pizza I've enjoyed in Las Vegas. The delivery is smooth and your good arrives intact and hot hot hot. Totally recommend for any local or tourist to our fabulous valley . A little pricey but you receive real food with real ingredients. So support a great pizza place that will keep one healthy and going in all those gambling frenzied clubbing days and nights"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want to order a pizza that's not on the menu. I tried to order a cheese pizza with certain veggies on it but the counter girl insisted I wanted a pizza with meat on it. I said \"no\" and I repeated my order. She then pointed to the veggie pizza on the menu and insisted that I wanted that. \"No\" I said again. She then started to scan the menu for something else. I tried to order my pizza again but gave up out of frustration. So even though I was starving, and really wanted to eat pizza, I was forced to watch my family eat pizza that was on the menu while I sat there, fuming. They burnt my husband's pizza so we were stuck there for another 20 minutes while they made him another. Give this place a pass-there are pizzerias out there with helpful staff who will let you order it your way and care about their customers."}
{"text":"This pizza is OMG , it's definitely a mom and pop shop. The pizza is fresh , the guys who work are friendly. I felt bad because I literally went there couple of min before closing, and I thought they weren't going to let me order, but in the contrary they even help me order, ( buffalo pizza) pizza is delicious , I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I wandered into this gem tonight not knowing what to expect. The staff was really friendly which, to me is very important. The restaurant was clean also. We ordered the Super Meaty and a small order of garlic knots to go. We took it home and it was so delicious!!! I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Review is for delivery service and food.  Totally clutch when in need of food at 2:00am on a Friday.   We ordered a pepperoni pizza, garlic knots and wings (spicy!) at 2:00am. The Joe's delivery driver arrived to our hotel--the Westin--promptly at 2:45am. Our order was still hot by the time we got it up to our room and the food itself hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through Yelp. It is an amazing place. The staff were super cool and I'm definitely coming back. We ordered the Meaty pizza and it is to die for. Everything was perfect about this pie. Nice thin New York crust with a burst of great flavor . Viva La Joe's pizza !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, salad, garlic bread, cannoli, & zapellas to our hotel room. We waited 1 hour and when my husband walked into our room we had everything except the damn PIZZA!!! I am seething. My husband called Joe's Pizza and the employee said, \"Oh your pizza is here\". Wtf????! How do send a delivery with everything except the PIZZA????! They didn't even offer to give our pizza for free especially since it was their fault that they didn't send our Pizza with our first order. On top of it all we're waiting for our Pizza again to be delivered and my husband calls again to find out where the delivery person is, and they are headed to the wrong freaking hotel!!!! Our hotel name is in our order. And our hotel is located right across the street from their store!!!!! WTH???! Neeeeever order from here!!!! If I could do a negative rating I would."}
{"text":"The first star is for the fast delivery we recieved at our resort. They came 10 min sooner then expected. Second  star is for the size of pizza and slices we recieved in the  extra large pizza it was a nice surprise. After that we were quickly disappointed the taste was very simple... Which I like simple clean authentic Italian food but it really lacked taste all around. I think for the $$ they should step it up a notch and revamp those flavors. I give it only worth $. If your looking for a memorable experience of flavor in pizza when ur in Vegas pass this pizza up its really not worth the stop. Good luck for the search of amazing quality pizza!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was horrible here. It tasted so rubbery & just not fresh at all , I definitely did not enjoy it & it's definitely not New York pizza , I'm from New York & it doesn't even have a hint of New York pizza in it , this is the most horrible pizza I've ever had & it did seem kind of \"not fresh\" & to make things worse ... The customer service on the phone to place the order for food was horrible , I've never received so much attitude from a worker in my life ... & I say this in a personal way & the fact that I am a manager & if customer service was given like that in my store ... It just would not be acceptable what so ever. I'm so bummed that the pizza was horrible because I was really so excited."}
{"text":"All negative reviews are true!!! I'd strongly suggest going somewhere else for pizza!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times for take out.  The pizza was pretty good but service has always been weak.  I think the prices are too high as well.    Today, I dined in with a friend.  I ordered pasta and salad.  As I started eating I found a small bug in my pasta.  I told the counter staff who did nothing.  Not even say they were sorry.  They asked me if it flew into the food and I replied regardless of how it got into the food I wasn't going to eat it.  I understand that things like this happen and wasn't angry about it but got angry at the reaction from the staff.  The service in this place sucks and I won't be going back.  There are too many good pizza/pasta/salad places to pay $30 for mediocre food and even worse staff."}
{"text":"Anyone who is familiar with the night scene in Scottsdale, has stumbled their way to this pizza joint at some place or another after the bars have let out. The pizza is greasy and tasty but definitely the cure to sober up and line the stomach with something solid after a 'rough' night.   The lady whom works there is a doll, very sweet and always in a great mood, despite having to deal with all the ridiculously sloppy drunk individuals there at the late hours."}
{"text":"While I disagree w/ Paul that this is THE best place for late night eats in Scootsdale( Im a long time Gus' fan) I will say that it is a GOOD place for late night eats if youre in that area. Our pizza was good, and thankfully, we got there just before the 2am rush.   We'd go again if we were w/ people that wanted to."}
{"text":"It's a good late night spot but that's about it.  It's not that good to go out of your way for.  On the softer soggy side.  The workers there late night when I went aren't the friendliest.  They don't look the greatest either.   I was wondering if they wash their hands when preparing the food.  Just saying."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN OLD TOWN Bar District!  Been coming here since the original owner Lori owed. I was initially sad to hear she was moving back to NYC and was curious what was gonna happen to the place.   The new owner's are amazing. They took my constructive criticism and made adjustments accordingly to get the pizza exactly how it was before! If you like a crispy bottom this is the place to go. None of the soggy bottom toppings falling off on first bite etc. Don't be fooled by Gus' Pizza down the way. This isn't a chain which in my opinion makes it better on its own. There's a line for a reason.... IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!"}
{"text":"I order a Pizza . I live within a half mile away , super close . Looking back I shoulda walked ... I'm told 30-40 min . Cool. Over an hour and two calls later I cancel because everyone passed out here from waiting . After cancelling , that message gets relayed to the driver. 15 minutes later  I get an angry knock at the door . I open and say, \"Hi , sorry man I canceled 10 minutes ago \" then, as if he rehearsed his verbal reprimand he was determined to dish out to me,  with a pissed off look, he explains wait times and what I should expect for delivery time looking like he wants unload and tell me off as I stand in the doorway in my pajamas , half asleep . I get a slight whiff of the pepperoni and sausage pie he's holding in his right arm and déjà Vu rushes over me as I start to get hungry again. However, I still say no thanks and he mumbles and grumbles as he walks away looking like he wants to shove that pie right in my face . It's obvious he was told I canceled the order but he wanted to get some satisfaction from telling me off. Maybe I'll try again but I'll walk next time ."}
{"text":"They delivered me pizza at work which wasn't even for us but hey the pizza was good and made it even better because it was free!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this place 3 stars because they deliver until 4am.  I recently visited Arizona from Hawaii for a work conference.   My flight from Hawaii got in at midnight, which got me to my hotel at around 2am, I was pretty hungry and with the time difference couldn't sleep, so I wanted food and couldn't find anything open.  The hotel recommended this place, so I called them. Sure enough, they were open. My cell phone had AWFUL reception, so I ended up ordering a whole pizza and some wings instead of a slice of pizza...but they DO take orders of pizza by the slice.  The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, and the pizza was meh. Oily, crust wasn't very good, I mean..really just a meh pizza.  The wings were pretty decent though, especially for a pizza place, so I was happy. I ended up throwing out most of the pizza as it was MASSIVE and wouldn't fit in the hotel fridge.  So pizza:  Quantity over quality. You will get a BIG pizza for a good price  On my last night there, I wanted food again, so I ordered some wings and this time gotten a chicken parm hero.   Delivery took a long time and they forgot my sandwich. They then came back with my sandwich and it was again, meh. Way under seasoned, and just not that good. Again, it was big, so quantity over quality."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza, as we stayed at a hotel down the street, under committed and over delivered on delivery time. Nutty Italian was a good salad option although we did not get the balsamic-dressing that we thought it came with and the cherry tomatoes on the salad were soft and bad."}
{"text":"Love Joe's! Always a great place to eat after a night in old town. And their pizza is great in my opinion. Very big pieces with lots of grease NY style.   Also have an excellenttttt Philly cheese steak. Seriously, it's won awards. Mac n cheese is also a pretty good item.   Only reason I have taken down 1 star is because they switched to some call center in Estonia or something. They never understand my order easily & I have to repeat it to make sure they got it right.   Tip: if the line is too long, call over the phone & order to go. Then walk in 5 minutes later & skip the whole line. (Assuming they get your order right)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my husband her comes here more often.   I love their pizza.  The service well eh I would have given 5 stars I'd the service was better.  This time the service was so bad I don't even know if I'll be back gonna have to find a new pizza place. ....bummed"}
{"text":"New York pizza, Las Vegas pizza.. east coast, west coast... Biggie, Tupac ... whatever. This is good pizza. Not extremely cheap.. not extremely pricey.. you get what you pay for.. and this is tasty stuff.  Across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel on paradise Road. I like the chicken pesto pizza... and the BBQ chicken pizza. I get a big mix greens salad every time as well and it's also nice and fresh. Good food is what I like. This is good food. Go, enjoy.. be happy."}
{"text":"This is just a note, not a review:  I think the reviewer confused this with Joe's and inverted the address 4480 vs 4880.  4480 looks like a parking lot and the Hard Rock is closer to 4880.  The phone number is the same for both. Joe's Pizza 4480 Paradise Road Ste 1100 Las Vegas, NV 89169 (702) 792-9001"}
{"text":"To be fair, I haven't had the pizza. Considering that \"Pizza\" is in the name, I should probably try it one of these days.  I have had the chicken roll, the philly cheese steak, and the cheese fries. Their fries are a little bizarre because they are very much homemade (big thick potato wedges that are soft and soggy, not crispy) and covered in cheese slices.   I love that they deliver late. The food so far has always been good enough for late night eating.  Short list this place if you're in the delivery area in case you find yourself up late and craving pizza and subs!"}
{"text":"Ever since joes has changed hands it's just gotten worse and worse. I work in the industry and have for a while, joes is always a staple. Not anymore! Went in there after working all day only to Be greeted by rude employees. We ordered our slices plus Philly cheesesteak fries (which they say they couldn't make when I've been getting those for a long time now.) and mozzarella sticks. They said they wouldn't make the fries and I explained how to charge me they finally succumb to my request. Next, the mozzarella sticks were mozzarella-less... Bit into three mozz sticks before I encounter one mozzarella stick that contain what was expected.   Bottom line--  Joes sucks now, spend your money else where. Bad customer service and subpar food.   In response to employees comment--  I asked for things that are on your menu. I asked for you to substitute fries for the bread on the Philly cheesesteak, all of those items are on your menu. I would understand if I was asking for things in which you did not have anymore, but you have both fries and Philly cheesesteaks on your menu. Also I didn't know that the three other only customers behind me (part of my group), counted as a busy time at Joe's."}
{"text":"really good pizza. wings were okay. garlic knots were okay. recommend Joe's specialty pizza."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to grab a quick slice of pizza.  Whether you're hung over or have a craving for pizza this is a good place to go.  I really like that they have 2 locations-this location on LV Blvd and another by the Hard Rock Hotel.     We've gone in for pizza by the slice and have ordered ahead for the full meal.  In addition to pizza, they also have wings, calzones, and salads.  I really like their Chicken and Pesto Pizza.  Another favorite is the Barbeque Chicken Pizza!  As always, you can't go wrong with cheese or pepperoni!    PS:  Get a side of their ranch...dip your pizza in it!  It's the best ranch ever!  Love it!"}

{"text":"Things have changed recently.  I used to come here in the past for some good New York style folding.  But the last time I went this summer (2013) the service was beyond disappointing.  TL;DR they don't dress like an employees of a restaurant and they ignore you.  First off:  The owner was sitting next to me as the following happened.  I arrive for a quick slice of cheese pizza for lunch.  You can buy pizza by the slice and they heat it up (like s'barros) but better.  Only two people in line and I order the cheese slice and the kid tells me he'll bring it out to me and sit down.   30 minutes later I go to the register to talk to the kid and he walks away from me and pretends to do something else behind the counter!  I sit back down and wait for him to come back to the counter.  He later comes back to answer the phone so I go up and stand in front of him while he is on the phone so I can catch him after he gets off.  I wait and he stalls the phone conversation.  I don't understand why he's avoiding me b/c I haven't said anything at all to him.  I was nice when I ordered too.  So someone who looked like a manager but was dressed like a cheap prostitute with her mammary glands hanging out asked me what I wanted.  I told her I waited +30 minutes for a slice of reheated cheese pizza and I would like my money back.  She looked back and saw a whole cheese pizza and asked if I wanted a slice from that and I told her I felt I didn't feel they want my business."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, New York style, the people behind the counter are not the friendliest."}
{"text":"This place does a nice meaty slice of pie, the chunky Lasagna pizza is disturbingly good.  Open late and convenient to the Strip, like the other reviewer says.  Make sure you let them heat up your slice first - not only does a hot warm slice of pie go down easier, but it kills the bacteria that are inevitable when food sits out under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and we decided to have our food delivered. We placed our order online. Very easy process. I must say the delivery experience was outstanding! Totally on time, professional, food was delivered hot, awesome food! I wish we had this Restuarant in California! Great Job Joes!!!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"They should be arrested for calling this New York pizza. I just left with a pizza to go. Its overpriced but no big deal if its good. The whole pie has 3 inches of soft chewy dough with no sauce or cheese they think is a pizza crust. For their info a pizza pie should have maybe an inch of crunchy crust around the edge. Not 3 inches of chewy dough. Almost 1/2 the pie is chewy dough instead of sauce and cheese. They should put a dominoes logo on their window."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Pizza by the slice, baby! Friendly staff. Great location. I like the name Joe and I really like pizza, so this is a win win."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza before I left work tonight. I stopped in and grabbed it, right on time. I got home about 12 minutes later and I got to enjoy one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The cheeses were delicious, the sauce tastes of fresh tomatoes and the pizza was cooked perfectly!   That pizza was my lunch AND my dinner! Thanks Joes!"}
{"text":"Pizza is alright, I've been ordering from this place for a bit over a year and it's good that they deliver less then the time they actually give you. It's a good place if you want pizza at 3:00 am after clubbing."}
{"text":"Joe's New York Pizza is a good late night place.  I can't really speak to how good this place is during the day, but the food court it is in (which also houses a Panda Express and Chipotle) is quite packed at around 2 AM on Saturday nights.  It's good comfort food for after clubbing.  I ordered a cheese pizza on Saturday and it tasted pretty good at the time.  Again, I can't speak to anything bout this place during the day.  It was just a good meal to eat when I was super hungry after a night out."}
{"text":"Folks, NY pizza is supposed to be a little greasy. If you don't like it go to Dominoe's or whatever.  I was a Joe's regular when I worked in the area. After I found another job (far, far away) I didn't go back for ages. When I did, I was surprised that the owner remembered me! (and kind of flattered).  Anyway Joe's pizza is NY pizza. Thing crust, shiny, a little drippy. I had it yet again tonight after Papa John's informed me they no longer deliver to my zip code (85250). Then I remembered Joe's delivered and the day (but sadly, not ALDS Game 5 at this point) was saved.  Just what I wanted--pizza, Joe's fantastic garlic knots, and the best house chopped salad anywhere. Delivered, no charge."}
{"text":"New York Pizza joint, in Arizona, with a Chicago owner.  Interesting....  This pizza was awesome, but a bit overpriced.  The owner was there when we went and she was super nice and got into some good conversation with us.  I'd definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I had the spaghetti pizza and it was a work of art. Unbelievably good pizza served here. The environment is pretty chill. Pop music, TV and fun decor. I will definitely try the other location when I'm in the area. Good place to go after a show at the hard rock hotel and casino."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good after a drunken night out in old town. It's just a bit greasy."}
{"text":"Wow the girl behind the counter was a total bitch, for being there for the first time I won't be back...even my son said to me after we sat down and said to me what's that girls problem...girl was wearing a gold chain that said gorgeous on it.. It should say ATTITUDES BEWARE......2 small pizzas and 1 drink $32.00. I hope the pizza is good.....20 min later it was good.. Then they brought us a new sample pizza gave us a free taste, 3 different types of cheese, ham, sour cream put that on the menu... Thank goodness for the man with the strong accent made the vist here good again..."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  yes I have had better pizza in ny.  but I dont think I have had better west of the mississippi. especially I notice its really great when it first comes out of the oven.  so I recommend if you go late night pick a slice that just came out not one sitting around a while."}
{"text":"After a long day on the Strip, we were hungry and tired and just wanted to eat somewhere that was still open and (hopefully) delivered. We searched and searched all over Yelp! to find this, which had the highest rating and was a close walk from the hotel.   Thus, we ended up here at Joe's New York Pizza. We called in our order of a large (6 slices) with pepperoni, sausage, and onions on one half. The person on the other end said it'd be ready in 10-15 minutes so we just watched tv some more.   We asked if they could deliver to the hotel, but they said we'd have to meet them at the entrance and not at our room. That sucked so we opted out of delivery and just went for pick up. Might as well.   10-15 minutes go by and we make our way towards the vicinity. When we entered and asked for our order, the woman in the front said it'd be about 5 more minutes. Poops. Anyway, the pizza finally finished and I paid about $22 for pizza that was just OKAY. I even had to pay an extra 50 cents for a thing of ranch. The sausage and pepperoni were salty as they should be but the onions were pretty much yellow onions sliced and just thrown onto half of the pizza. I was hoping that they'd use red onions but the yellow ones were still alright.   Oh yeah and you can tell the pizza was over oily because the oil soaked through the cardboard box and stained the bed cover at the hotel. Hmmm...."}
{"text":"Pizza was over an hour late and cold. Delivery guy argued with me instead of sympathized. Then tattled on me to yelp eats.  He claimed I was the one being uncooperative. Just don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This is a great example of relativity -- at 2am in Las Vegas, this would be 5 star. At 9pm in NYC, it'd be a 3.5 star (mainly for price).  In the day in Las Vegas, this is 4-4.5.  Good pizzas (NY-style thin crust, maybe a bit California-inspired on toppings), accurate estimates for delivery and pickup times, and friendly service.  Prices are a bit high ($32 after tax for a loaded 20\" pizza; $25 would seem more fair), but not too bad for what you get."}
{"text":"It's soooo hard to find a great NY style pizza joint on the opposite coast as the big city so you could imagine the feeling of pure joy I had when I stumbled upon this marvelous pizza establishment. Every slice of pizza I tasted was just absolute perfection. Not to mention, they have a wide variety of specialty pizzas so you can try a different kind every time you visit. My favorite was the Greek white. It had just the right amount of cheese, sauce, and delicious toppings that made my mouth water over and over. Best part about this place is their location and their weekend hours. Open 24 hours Thursday through Saturday, which is perfect for those late night pizza cravings and they're on the south end of the strip which means they have a have the perfect location to appeal to locals and tourists. Worth stopping by and grabbing a slice next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"Decent slice of pizza. I went there on lunch one day since I work at UNLV. I had their buffalo chicken pizza and a side salad. The salad was pretty tasty and although I wish that they made their own salad dressing opposed to just giving me a packet of Newman's (although Newman's is very tasty). The buffalo chicken was just standard. It needed a little bit more buffalo sauce to be able to taste the buffalo chicken flavor."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here so she could try her first piece of New York Pizza. Everybody was real friendly and the pizza was hot and delicious. The variety of different Pizza types was incredible and all available by the slice. My daughter is already asking me to go back next weekend."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had! I heated up the leftovers the next day and it was still amazingly good."}
{"text":"Located in a little strip mall by the Hard Rock, Joe's serves up some big thin slices of greasy meaty flavor! There's a big selection out if you're ordering by the slice. Get them heated up, though, if you order by the slice!  Now, they offer lots of the NY-style thin crust flat and wide slices, but I cannot get enough of their stuffed slices, weighing in at about a pound a slice, stuffed with sausage and pepperoni and goodness between two thin crusts, topped with more and sauce and cheese. These are a handful and def a bellyful! About the fattiest slice around and tasty as anything, these make a great takeaway to bring on the flight, too! Yum-o."}
{"text":"Love love this pizza. Right across from Hard rock. Pizza by the slice. Every time I'm in vegas I stop by Joe's. The slices are huge, one is enough to share. Try the traditional pizza or one of their specialty slices either way you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. I was staying across from this shopping center when I interviewed for my job here, and I went to grab some pizza and a beer after my interviews. Obviously this is NY style pizza, and it was pretty greasy. However, the ingredients taste fresh, and the price is pretty nice, especially noting that there isn't much else as far as \"fast food\" in the area. This is a usual stop of mine after any happy hour at Paradise Cantina, as the food here is good, cheap and filling. The staff here has always been friendly, and they have to have a good sense of humor as anytime I've been here there has never been a shortage of drunk patrons."}
{"text":"Amazing food, we had salads, sandwiches and pizza. All were exceptionally delicious. We opted for delivery and were quoted an hour and our food came in about 35 min. Plus our resort offered 10% off. Would recommend to anyone and has 24 hr delivery."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star NY style pizza joint!   Pizza is good here but what really sets this place apart are the increadibly convenient hours! It's open from 9 am to 4 am. You read that right. THEY'RE OPEN 19 HOURS A DAY!!!    We all know what it's like to be out super late and getting hungry after a long night of Old Town Scottsdale fun. Well Joe's has you covered. Pizza, burgers and more all available basically all day and night.  Good foldable NY slices at very reasonable prices. Kind of hard to find the 1st time but well worth the effort. Parking garage in back has free public parking.  Sunday in Old Town during football season makes parking on the streets nearby tough.   Remember to use your yelp cash back benefit here. Those rewards add up quickly!"}
{"text":"I will never again use this pizza place again in my life. I work at a nearby business and I decided to try them, Lo and behold they always charged me more than what the specified amount was. This was not an isolated incident either this happened multiple times. Always ask for a receipt if you decided to eat here other wise they will take advantage of you.  DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THIEF'S,"}
{"text":"Delivery service:  So I ordered pizza from here around 8:15 on Monday and we were super hungry and we were like a mile away from this place. They quoted me 45min-1hr wait time, which, I thought was no big deal. BUT then it became later and later and I had to call to see where my pizza guy was at and then she said, \"Oh we are really busy but he should be there any minute he was already on his way\" when another hour passed by, so... Why did She quote me an hour when it's been about 2 1/2 hours since we've called... Idk...but the point of this is it was $60 something bucks and I had to wait 3 hours for this pizza to get here. Wasn't really pleased about it. I understand you are busy and popular but that was WAY too long.   Food: pizza was like Luke warm. Pretty greasy but it wasn't bad although we were pretty hungry so who really knows how it tasted. Pastas were warm so that was good.   Overall: delivery service sucks. Food is alright."}
{"text":"The only thing New York about this place was the cup my soda came in. The pizza was okay, but certainly not New York pizza as advertised. Garlic knots were good. Customer service was good and my food was served quickly. WAY over priced though which is why I give it 2 stars. Not bad, just deceitful advertising for anybody looking for a New York flavor pizza and too expensive."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering delivery I ordered a large pizza half Hawaiian half pepperoni and sausage and I ordered wings as well. The delivery guy got lost and I got my pizza like an hour from time of ordering. So I got my pizza and realized that they forgot to put sausage on my pizza..so when I called and explained what happened the manager Jose offered to replace my pizza but I had to wait again so I told him it wasn't a big deal I just wanted to let you guys know myth at my pizza was wrong so he apologized and stated that he will give me a credit for my pizza and replace it next time I order. So I called in today and explained everything and told them I have a credit so the guy tells me I only a ten percent off I explained that's wrong it should be a credit for another pizza. So he put me on hold and another guy came on the phone and started reading the notes but read it to me very slow as if I was slow and didn't understand...it was offensive and this situation could of been handled very differently because I will never order from you guys ever again"}
{"text":"Called in to order @ 1:50 am just before the bars closed. Trying to beat the late night rush. I was told 45 min. Its now 3:32 am over and hour and a half later still no pizza. What could have made it take more than 2 times as long? My answer is not my problem.  I Canceled the order."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and it's ok not great but the price is double what the other places charge"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. The amount of pepperoni on it was disappointing though. There was about 2 pieces per slice. But it's pizza so it wasn't terrible. What was awful were the garlic sticks (knots?)! I took one bite and had to spit it out. They were covered in giant chunks of garlic and tasted as if they had just fell into a pool of olive oil. No flavor, gross texture, do not order these!"}
{"text":"A little expensive for just some pizza, but the pizza is definitely good.  We had lunch here before our drive home, we got half super meaty and half 2x pepperoni (yes, we like meat).  Both of which were delicious and really hit the spot.  When we arrived it was empty, when we were leaving, every seat was taken, so this appears to be a pretty popular place.  One of us also got a sandwich here, and the thing is gigantic, over a foot long and probably half a foot in diameter, it was like the size of a football.  The staff here was also very helpful and friendly, so I would definitely return if you're off the strip craving some pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza totally sucks. If you have no choice and want to eat pizza, you probably won't be satisfied when you leave. Super greasy and the crust is paper thin, but not crispy? You might as well grab a fork and dive in because you cant pick up this floppy slice of pie. I hate to write a negative review, but you deserve to know what you're walking into."}
{"text":"We're talking maybe the best pizza in Las Vegas. However not cheap so don't come here expecting to save any money. I ordered 1 extra large 3 topping and 10 wings and spent about 41 dollars, the pizza was great but the wings not so much. I could definitely tell the chicken wasn't fresh, so was it worth 40 bucks? Probably not, stick with the salads and pizza and u won't be disappointed. The girl behind the counter wasn't exactly friendly but what are u gonna do,"}
{"text":"Well I hope the pizza is good because their delivery promise was extremely wrong and way slow half hour later than promised.  Well the pizza was good and it was worth the wait thanks"}
{"text":"Alright, well, tonight marks the third time I have ordered a pizza late night, and never received it from Joes. So, tonight, I placed an order online, and called to confirm. I was told it was on the way. This was around 230am. I was told it would take around 45 minutes (understandable) At about 350, i still have not received my pizza. I called again, and the woman on the phone told me they were closed, which is fine, then when I asked if it was going to receive my pizza I ordered an hour and a half ago, I was hung up on. I work late shifts, it's hard to get food late at night, and it's ridiculous that this seems to always happen here."}
{"text":"A busy day at work called for ordering in and someone in the office suggested Joe's New York Pizza. Pizza is usually something everyone can agree on and they deliver to our office.   I went online and quickly found several delicious options. The Gigantic size and Humongous size are only a few dollars difference so I went for the largest size. The online ordering was really simple and allowed for ordering as a guest instead of requiring an account. Payment is handled at the end of the ordering process and it was only 45 minutes for delivery.   The Pepperoni Pizza was my favorite. The flavors were great and it was a good kind of greasy. It tasted like a sneaky diet splurge. The crust was okay, but not particularly notable. The Hawaiian was also delicious. Ham and pineapple on pizza is always a delicious option.  Since I was ordering for a group I went with safe bets, but Joe's has some interesting options. I was surprised to see options like Hungarian Chicken (!) and Chorizo. They also have paninis, salads, calzones, and some desserts."}
{"text":"This place has something called the meat pie.  Seriously?  Are you hungover at the Hard Rock and need some fuel before you hit up Rehab and show off all the veins on your abs, and how perfectly those Ed Hardy shades compliment your chiseled jaw line?  Then head over here for a slice of meat pie.  Or just a slice of anything.  Delicious pizza and a wide variety.  Only dropped a star because the service time seems a little slow even when there's not many people inside."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my boyfriend for a quick lunch and everything we had was so delicious!  Some of the best pizza I've had in awhile.  I love the decor in here too, looks nice and cozy.  They do have some specials listed by the door for certain pizzas(i think just cheesr), but we went for the gourmet pizzas.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hardrock Hotel and found what we thought, was a New York Style pizza.   We were in the mood for pizza and buffalo wings, Simple enough. My husband and I  ordered a small pepperoni pizza and order of 10 mild buffalo wings, which totaled to 24.95, ordered to go. When we got to our room we opened the pizza box (to the naked eye it looked like a regular pepperoni pizza) When I picked up the first slice the toppings slid right off. I put the toppings back on and took a bite and.... the pizza was doughy, uncooked and just bleh! So I moved on to the Buffalo wings. I ordered mild because most of the time when I order hot, the sauce is just fire hot! Well apparently mild means no sauce,  and when I took a bite of the chicken it tasted like previously frozen/old chicken, not good AT ALL!  Long story short it all tasted like shit and was not worth the money. Even if I had been drunk I think it still would have tasted like shit."}
{"text":"Can't review restaurant.  Bought pizza as take out.  Had a \"Manhattan Loaded\" pizza. Very tasty not too greasy. Nice flavor. Try it!"}
{"text":"Came here to pick up a bunch of pizzas and caesars salad.  I highly recommend the following: - Manhattan loaded - Veggie - Hawaiian (if you like a bit of sweet and savory)  Love the fact that the crust was thin and not doughy. Service was excellent and staff were extremely helpful.   Would definitely come back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This pizza is BOMB!!!! It has a medium thickness crust that is perfectly cooked.. Not too chewy not too crunchy. The sauce and cheese proportions were done to perfection. We went with a basic pepperoni pizza and we were extremely satisfied. I would highly recommend trying this place for the perfect off strip pizza"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday, and was great pizza! My favorite was the garlic knots, good for classic pizza!"}
{"text":"Great stuff. You can get 2 slices and a drink for like $10. Best pizza I've had in vegas by far. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Expensive. Not that great. I am quite not sure what they have is NY style."}
{"text":"Great pizza and selection. Service was friendly when I was there. Two huge slices and a drink for around $11. Not gourmet by any stretch, but excellent NY style."}
{"text":"Not a bad 12 am in room pizza experience. Not the greatest pizza ive ever had, but did the trick."}
{"text":"I love pizza and Joe's New York Pizza sure delivered what I expected. The spinach ricotta pizza was delicious. The chunks of ricotta was just enough and the spinach had flavor. I also ordered buffalo wings. Although there were more drummettes than wings, it was still good. The only reason why I gave 4 stars vs 5 is because I also ordered their garlic knots which were not that great. They fill the knots with pesto which was extremely oily and sickening. I wish I passed on the knots and just stuck with the pizza."}
{"text":"Joe's was recommended by the WorldMark Resort where we were staying. It was a great recommendation. We had 27 in our family and ordered 4 humongous pizzas and 50 chicken wings. We asked the order-taker to just pick 5 of his favorite chicken wings and make 10 each for us. They were a huge hit. We also ordered a pepperoni, Hawaiian, grandma cheese, and another pizza. They were all excellent. We picked up our own order. It was ready on time. The staff was very friendly and the food was superb. Our whole family loved the pizza and wings. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the humongous lasagna pizza for delivery. Appreciate that they called to confirm & let us know it could take up to 45min. Delivered in less than 30 min. Great price, hot & fresh.   During our ten night stay in LV we ate there four times."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The service is always great and so is the food. I've had pizza in NYC and I think this is the closest in Vegas that you're gonna get! So far, anyway. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza couldn't even eat it after driving to get it when the delivery would have taken an hour and a half ... definitely not worth it.... $37 later and the best thing was the sprite! Disappointed"}
{"text":"Staying at garden inn and ordered lunch.  Baked Zito and garlic knots. Food arrived quick and was better than Italian we had last night at fancy place tart we paid double.  Easy to go Joe's!"}
{"text":"This review comes a bit late but two Sunday's ago we ordered a large pizza at 9:45pm and were told it would arrive in about 45 minutes. A little over an hour later we called back to get an update and were told the pizza was still at the shop. It finally arrived TWO hours after ordering and was completely soggy and grease-soaked. I was honestly shocked they could even charge someone for such poor quality and service. Quite a disappointment as this is one of the few spots in Scottsdale that we actually liked ordering from."}
{"text":"They charged our credit card twice!! maybe that's a scam they run on Vegas tourists thinking most people wont notice, but we sure did. Chicken parm was good, spaghetti was good. Pizza was super greasy."}
{"text":"The best delivery ever!! Not only a pizza for after a night out and you're craving some, it is a great option for anytime.   Get the pepperoni thin crust and garlic bites!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food around 3:45 pm online after I ordered my food I received a confirmation stating my food will be available for pickup around 4:40pm. I arrived at the facility around 5pm for the next 20 mins nobody could find my order & the first 10 mins they asked my name for approximately 20mins no one could find the order around 5:30 someone found the order online but i had to wait another 45 mins for the food this was a horrible experience my first time ordering online from them I won't be back I didn't receive my food until 6:20 pm and on top of that the first 5 mins in the store no one acknowledged me wow"}
{"text":"The pizza is great and I noticed the tables are higher in the dinning area. And I was served while sitting down waiting for my pizza slice. Great service."}
{"text":"Great sweet red sauce and they came 20 mins early. They had the perfect cheese ratio on the pizza and the mushrooms were the right amount. The food was very well done!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza I have ever eaten in Las Vegas! If you're local and you live away from the strip it's worth the drive! Words cannot describe how delicious the pizza is, gourmet all the way! If you're just visiting Las Vegas, this place is a must on your to do list. I'm not kidding the pizza is that good! Customer service was excellent, The girl who helped us was Nikki. She was very pleasant, very happy and  we couldn't of asked for better service! We ordered the Joe's favorite pizza which had bacon, cheese and pepperoni ... to die for!! Do yourself a favor and try this spot, it's right across from the Hard Rock hotel & casino."}
{"text":"The gf and I eat a lot of pizza and this is among the best we've had! Friendly service and nice atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live way too close to New York to say this is New York  pizza, but the pizza tasted better than most places in Las Vegas.  The reason I like New York style pizza is because of the NY water used to make the crust.  This is impossible to replicate if they use water from Las Vegas.  Other than that the toppings, cheese and sauce were perfect.  The staff were so friendly and the signs on the wall are fun to look at when I was waiting."}
{"text":"Great customer service and pizza. Always love stopping by here when visiting my grandparents in vegas! Delicious. :)"}
{"text":"MUST stop by here every time I am in Vegas. Great big slices and the prices are pretty good as well. Not in the best neighborhood, across from Hard rock Hotel but damn good pizza maybe the best in Veags"}
{"text":"Ordered the white truffle pizza   It was good but very oily from the truffle oil. Super rich could only eat one slice  Cannoli was very tasty   Delivered to TI within an hour, and gave lots of plates, and napkins"}
{"text":"My first time here and nothing but good vibes. Tucked in the corner of all of drunken old town, this place is a true gem. Great pizza by the slice and I love the crisp dough, flavorful sauce, not overly saturated with cheap cheese and baked to perfection. A definite great place to eat before or after the clubs."}
{"text":"so....the name of it is joes \"NEW YORK\" pizza...so i was surprised when i ordered a \"large cheese PIE\" & received the death stare or \"wtf are u talking about look!?!?!\"   forgive me for thinking i can order like i order when i am home in NY at ANY pizzeria.  when the cashier asked if i meant a dessert pie..i told him i dont know what he is talking about...he then gave me that wtf look again. to add to my surprise, i looked at another worker when i said i that i just wanted a whole cheese PIE... he too gave me the wtf look n turned away. overall it was good...and quick serivce, once they finally understood what i meant.  but making me feel like i was out of my mind for ordering a \"pie\" ruined my first visit.  i doubt ill b back..i rather go to other pizzerias that claim to b ny authentic n truly know what a cheese pie is."}
{"text":"We had some friends take us here so our expectations were high...  But the pizza blew away our expectations.  Now we come here every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast and friendly. Not cheap, about $5 a slice, but it's a big slice. We tried several different types and they were all great. They even cut the kid slices in half. I will definitely be back the next time I have a concert at the hard rock (it is right across the street). Go out of your way for this place, because it is great. Oh, the soda machine is select your own, and a lot of fun for the kids!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed in the delivery...driver obviously did not keep the pizza level.  When we opened it, the entire pizza was all mashed up on one side of the box.  Also, considering the restaurant is only about 5 min away the pizza was only slightly warm at best."}
{"text":"Visiting vegas I wanted to find a good pizza. Everyone recommended I try Joes, so I did. Service is excellent, very friendly and helpful staff. Clean place. Pizza is good, but not wow. Kinda over hyped. But give them a try!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the pizza is a little bit underwhelming.  I used to come here frequently just for the convenience factor and the fact you can buy pizza by the slice.  I always seemed to get the same girl helping me, and she had pretty much zero personality.    Now with a Capriotti's next door, I won't be coming back here.  If you are around the strip and in the mood for some pizza, go to the Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"The only place I know of that offers chicken paprikash.  It is really good stuff. I have tried to find paprikash for years and this is the only place I know of to get it. It is a Hungarian dish that is really tasty. So glad I found you Joe's pizza."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza. Went with two slices of cheese and honestly one was all I needed. These are huge slices. Big enough to fold."}
{"text":"I've been to the location by UNLV, but this was the first time I had been to this location. The pizza here is very good. I got the pepperoni and the spinach, tomato and ricotta slice. They were both really good. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the prices are very reasonable. I really love places that do pizza by the slice, and this is definitely some of the better places I've been. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered online and the second time they have screwed up my order.  I ordered a 19\" pizza and garlic knots...  I specifically asked for no mushrooms and guess what my pizza was covered in mushrooms.  Why can't people pay attention to detail?  It's not rocket science, you look at what the customer ordered if you care about the customer you make the pizza the way the customer ordered it.  There will not be a third opportunity as these guys apparently don't pay attention.  I paid $30 for a pizza I could not eat because it had mushrooms on it.  That's $30 in the trash....  Time to find a new pizza place, good thing there are several in town."}
{"text":"I took a picture after I ate haha - which I never do. I normal don't review food until afterwards and if I really like it I will let it sit for awhile.  I will take exception here.  After a long day of setting up my booth. I was so tired and hungry I was craving for spaghetti. I found this place outside of the strip on Las Vegas blvd - this was by far the best spaghetti I have ever eaten next @Robert Palumbo spaghetti. I will give Joe 's 4.5 stars. Rob you still get 5 stars.  Don't be fooled from the outside the food is amazing and to my surprise. Please open a store in Orange County CA!"}
{"text":"Love this place after a long night. They're open 24 hours which is AMAZING!! Came here after a long night out in the wee hours of the morning and had a couple slices of pizza! They were sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. The cheese pizza is a bit greasy but can be dabbed with some napkins. The website has a buy 2 slices get 1 free slice so for 6 bucks, you get a huge amount of pizza which it good for putting me into a pizza coma once I get back to work."}
{"text":"This restaurant is 45 minutes past their estimated delivery time. Very inconvenient and even though they have amazing food, they are not accommodating their mistake or delay."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! I placed an order online last night, it said it would arrive at 1:25. I called them at 1:40 and they said it was on its way. I called again at 2:15 and they hung up on me, then stopped answering my calls entirely. When I called from a different number, the man who answered the phone sounded drunk and could not give me any definite answer about the status of my order, after wasting my time he said he couldn't find the order and then hung up on me. After calling AGAIN at 2:40 they said that the order has JUST printed. I asked if they would comp it for me and they said no but said they could give me some free food, so I asked for a free pizza. When the order finally arrived over 2 hours after I ordered it the driver didn't even ask for a signature, and I got no receipt. The \"free pizza\" was 3 nasty slices they just threw into a box. I was so unsatisfied, I would have cancelled my order from the beginning but since I placed it online it had already ran my card and they refused remove the charge. I will NEVER give this place my business again! I understand deliveries take longer but the amount of time I had to wait was insane, especially since they could not clarify the problem. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE THEY SUCK!"}
{"text":"Listen, I'm not an expert at \"true\" New York pizza.  I've only been to Buffalo and I was 4 at the time.  If pizza is supposed to be like Buffalo, then it should be boring and cold... and have some produce on it.  Actually, my last trip to Joe's, I had a slice of greek-inspired heaven.  Feta cheese, spinach, olives, and other goodness.  But it wasn't hot.  Or warm.  It was cold.  No bueno.  So, in essence, it was still like Buffalo.  This didn't distract me, though.  I still ate the damn thing and was happy as a mosquito at United Blood Services.  I even ate half of my girlfriend's slice.  She got some massively meaty slice.  God bless carne.  All in all, this is a great option if you're getting out of the Hard Rock after heavy drinking/head banging at the Joint.  Stumble across the street and get some grub!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good with a nice thin crust.  They deliver and are open until 4am.  You can't really beat that!  Nice midnight snack."}
{"text":"Food was alright nothing special. I had the chicken parm pasta and it was good but didn't come with any bread or salad. Boyfriend had a small pizza with jalapeño, pepperoni, and ricotta. With 2 small drinks the total was $35. Little pricey"}
{"text":"Love it.  They have the traditional and completely unique pizzas as well.  Check out the Hungarian Goulash Pizza.  Their apps are great too and they actually make the ranch dressing so it's the bomb.  Clean and nice atmosphere.  It never disappoints and it's open late."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker and it's been hard finding a pizza place that is like home. While it isn't completely NY style pizza it's pretty close.  **update 7/23/16** don't bother ordering online from them... They say order online and save 20% but they don't honor that when you pickup the food. Lame."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've lived in Vegas for 18 years and I just tried this place the other day and fell in love. Amazing quality in every thing you order. The meatball parmigiana sub is my personal favorite because the meatballs are amazing as well as the homemade sauce and the roll they use is toasted and is crispy on the outside and soft as heck on the inside and I have tried the Buffalo chicken sub as well as a Hawaiian pizza. Everything tasted amazing. The pizza dough has a great flavor and the sauce is perfect. Every sandwhich meal comes with a bag of chips & pickle included which is a very nice compliment to the sub. They also offer 9.99 all you can eat pizza slices from 2pm-5pm! Have dine in or out. They also have the soda machine where you can have all sorts of drinks! Haha love when places have that machine. Best New York style pizza in Las Vegas hands down. Love the atmosphere and the employees are very kind and friendly and funny. Immediately feels like home. Cooking taste like it too!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pies for our office and tried to pay with my Samsung pay. The manager came over and said they do not accept this form payment. He said \" Your breaking the law! Your breaking lots of laws because there is no way I can verify who u are! We don't accept any phone pay stuff!!\" He yell this out and basically called me a criminal. So we are taking our business somewhere else. It's one thing not to accept NEW technology but to tell me I am breaking the law..a customer!! I am a limousine driver for one of the biggest hotels in Vegas and I won't be referring anyone to your business."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza last night from these clowns. The pie was obviously pre made and then just tossed into an oven to be re heated. Crust was far from tasty at all. Nothin but crunch which indicates that it was pre made. The wings were well...mediocre. My main complaint is with the pizza however. I've had issues with joes in the past and they never made it right. I literally chose them as a last option; and that's what I'll recommend. Too bad they're willing to call themselves a NY pizza spot and sell a weak, horrible and awful product such as the one I paid $30 for. Oh, and let's not forget how rude the staff is at this place. Don't get crazy over the phone with me again joes; I happen to know where the joint is located. All in all; you're better off with a digiorno pizza from Walmart."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly, great service! Ordered the White Spinach pizza and it was mouth watering good. Definitely will be going back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place in FOREVER (I'm a little old for this part of Scottsdale nowadays), but found myself imbibing at DJ's recently, and a friend wanted to stop in here sustenance. It was good. I had a slice of cheese and something else (Hawaiian maybe?), and they were both good. A little greasy (of course), but still yummy.   Given this place's location & hours it obviously caters to the late night drinking crowd, but I remember a LONG time ago, I would stop in here Fridays after work and pick up whole pies for my family and they were always very tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered pepperoni pizza and salad. Got only a pizza, it also had red peppers on it. I probably got the wrong order because I didn't order red peppers and there was no salad. (I was on the phone when it arrived so I didn't notice until driver was gone). Emailed their contact info on their website, undeliverable. Not pleased.   No, I wouldn't try again since I was charged for something I didn't receive. It took an hour to get the delivery, why would I wait another hour to receive what I paid for? Fix your website 'contact us' so that it doesn't come back as undeliverable.   Why on earth would I go there again? You didn't even offer to refund me for the salad I never got."}
{"text":"I got a coupon from the zip code magazine!! So I ordered wings a drink and a small cheese for $17! Pizza was super cheesy!! Wings were a bit spicy even though I ordered mild! And the soda machine is awesome! Lol! Place looked clean and nice! Bathrooms are nice and clean!! Pizzas are a bit pricey so I won't be back unless I have a coupon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious New York pizza! 3.50 a slice and ready immediately. A few tables to sit down and eat at and its in the location where all the bars are at! Open til 4am every night!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Las Vegas. More variety than anywhere else and the quality of the crust and sauce is actually on par with New York City.  A lot of places say New York Pizza but this place actually means it."}
{"text":"Really Upsetting! Ive have been a loyal customers of Joe's for years now as its in our neighborhood and have always had such good service and amazing pizza...I ordered their pizza weekly! Ive always loved their greasy large super cheesy pizza. Ive noticed the last few times i have ordered the pizza was horrible, cheese was falling off everywhere, so much sauce or its not even NY Style. Tonight just really ruined it for me. I ordered my pizza and left in the comments to add ranch and buffalo. Our pizza arrived almost an hour later after the delivery man who didn't speak such good english called me 20 minutes prior to arriving asking where my exact place of residence was, i literally live 7 minutes at most from the store. When he got here, even though it stated on the receipt when delivered about the sauces the driver looked at me clueless when i asked where the sauces were. He just said its not on the receipt when it clearly states so. I sit down to eat and open up the box and the pizza is ICE COLD. Literally stale at this point. I called them to complain and was HUNG UP ON 4 TIMES IN A ROW. Horrible customer service. After calling back the woman who has an accent had a rude tone. I was transferred to the store after 20 minutes of being hung up on and being on hold numerous times. I was told the manager was to contact me tomorrow to resolve this. Its just really disappointing to see how downhill Joe's has gone in the last few months, it almost seems like its under new ownership or management because instead of calling the store directly your sent to an outbound office. I definitely wont be spending anymore money here and sadly have to find a new neighborhood pizza spot of my liking."}
{"text":"Quick and nice delivery through grubhub. However half the toppings spilled into the box off the pizza and the wings were a bit dry. I guess I just have to check the pizza before I take it next time. The half that wasn't ruined was good though."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sandwich fan but the hot sandwiches here are not only hearty but they're delicious. 5 stars because it was a pleasant surprise to find such a good value off the strip serendipitously."}
{"text":"I needed to grab something quick to eat before my flight. This place was close to the Hard Rock Hotel, so it worked. I ordered a slice of the vegetarian pizza, the garlic knots, and a Mediterranean salad. The pizza was okay, but the garlic knots were soo good. They were warm and soft and the garlic was not overpowering.  The Mediterranean salad was excellent. It was full of fresh veggies. The best part of the salad were these crispy, seasoned baked pita chips."}
{"text":"... pizzas pretty dam tasty ... me likey .. and they have some bomb ass ranch ..............."}
{"text":"Had horrible customer service over the phone while attempting to place a delivery order. Manager Miguel called me back an hour later per my request and just kept talking over me. He wouldn't let me tell him what happened, he just kept making up excuses and talking nonstop. I told him I didn't understand why he called me if he just wants to talk over me. I warned him that if he kept talking over me that I would have to hang up on him. He just kept talking over me so I ended up hanging up on him. How is this genius the manager?"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever encountered. Didn't even get past the phone conversation.  Was on hold for 8 min listening to background noise..   Hung up,  called again..  And all I got was \"I'm busy (very rude)  I'm all alone\"..  All he had to do is say what would you like to order instead of babbling and excuses why he never made it through business school.   Would not give them a chance!"}
{"text":"Service was quick.  The place makes several pizzas and then throws your slice in for a quick reheat.  Because the crust is so thin it comes out cracker like after a re-heat.  The pizza was ok but I'd rather go up north to Ray's or a little farther west to Taste of Italy."}
{"text":"This pizza was amazing best pizza I have had in along time. Love that the pizza is made fresh and they reheat the pizza making it crispy and the cheese bubbly. We are coming back to get wings later"}
{"text":"Good pizza always hot.. never soggy mushrooms... the price is good delivery time good. The staff is confused grant it maybe she was new but she told me they dont deliver to me because im too far but they have  always in the past. oh well."}
{"text":"Joe's used to be better. The owner sold it about 1 1/2 years ago, and she moved back to NJ. Shame how the new owner tweaked a great recipe. Hopefully they go back to the recipe they purchased."}
{"text":"My pizza slices were so hard my gums are bleeding from trying to chew it. All i could taste was burn and dry chicken. Would not go back. $9.00 for 2 slices would have been better with dominos."}
{"text":"Just got some pizza take out for dinner, nothing crazy. Honestly it wasn't very good at all. We could have gotten one of those $5 pizzas from little Caesars instead. Tasted exactly the same. Disappointed that we spent $14, we could have gone somewhere better with that. Oh well. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"When I went there it was bomb, but when I had it delivered it wasn't that great at all way too expensive not quality pizza"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place out seeing that it won an award. However, I was extremely disappointed in the overall quality of the pizza. The cheese didn't seem fully melted, there was almost too much cheese, and the crust was similar to cardboard. This was definitely not an award winning pizza. I am very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza last night. By the time it arrived (about 10 minutes late) it wasn't even remotely warm and it was super soggy. I have eaten here multiple times and it has never been a problem before. Glen was very kind and took care of the issue after my complaint."}
{"text":"I think the rule to actually like this pizza and actually want to eat it is to be drunk.  I was drunk and I loved the white pizza with spinach.  My friend had the cheese pizza...she didn't like it.  She was sober."}
{"text":"I work for one of the largest Banded Names in the world.  We ordered from this location at least 3 days a week here in Las Vegas, and up until last week, we were all very happy with the food and the service.  One afternoon we ordered 3 calzones, of which 2 were ok, and the third had NO MOZZ cheese inside.  I decide to complain, since it seemed to be out of character for them.  \"No problem\" they said, \"We can give you a credit on your next order\"  Our next order was the following day, which consisted of 2 orders of wings, one hot, one plain and a large pizza.  Most of the cheese and the toppings on the pizza were slid over into the box, as if it had been placed in there that way on purpose.  The dough was raw and soggy in parts.  We showed this to the delivery guy, and his comment was \"Oh that's bad.  Go ahead and keep it, we will get you a new one.\"  We thought, \"COOL\"  Then we got to the wings.... PURE RUBBER and the celery  was so old that when we bent it in half, it didn't SNAP!  I have many pictures that I tried to post on here, but JOES keeps removing them!  Last resort, we called back to tell them about the pizza and wings and what the delivery guy told us.  Again, they said, \"No problem\"  THEN 20 minutes later, they called us to say the only way they would \"replace\" the order, was if we sent the entire pizza and all the wings back.  However, the delivery guy told us to keep it.  Starving, we nibbled a bit here and there waiting for the RIGHT order to show up.  When we told the girl on the phone that some had been eaten and most thrown in the garbage, they refused to provide us with any further Customer Service.  Our company has been doing business with this establishment for over a year, and we have spent $1000's of dollars, and in the end this is how we are treated?? NEVER AGAIN!  Joes NY Pizza's Customer Service and food SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, online through Slice, Sunday, May 7 2018 at 1150 pm received a confirmation email with a 60 min delivery eta. I called at 1250 am and was hung up on. I called back at 0130 and was put on hold. They never picked up and after 15 minutes I hung up. I called back at 0230, by this time over 2 hours waiting. They confirmed my name and location, I'm literally 6 minutes down the road, but unfortunately I'm working overnights and can't leave the job, and they said it was out for delivery. I waited until 0345 and called back and asked for the manager. First he said he couldn't find my order, asked how I ordered it, I stated through slice, from their website, he then found my order confirmed my name and location, and then had the nerve to say the delivery driver called me and said I didn't answer. He asked what apartment number I was at. I informed the \"all knowing manager\" that I work at a hospital down the street and that I'm in the emergency department. There was notes attached to my order to \"please deliver to the emergency department\" name of the hospital and address were in the notes, which they confirmed several times. The manager then asked if I wanted the pizza, I asked will it be fresh, he said he could bring the same pizza back, really? A 4 hour old pizza, wow, I never received customer service like this before. I even lived in New York they don't treat you like this. I asked the manager for a refund, he said okay. I'm still waiting for a refund 3 days later. ugh, never again, don't do it, there are other pizza places closer lol"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Las Vegas!  Best service.  Kristi's help and Coustomer Service was second to none. She help us pick the best mix of pizza, wings and sides  that made our experience the best. The food was perfect. Pizza was superb. Thanks again to Kristi!  We will be back every time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, bad sandwiches, bad sides. The ingredients are the lowest quality and cheapest they could get. Everything from this place is out of a can, jar or package. If you want bad pizza, this is your place. I'm stunned at the positive reviews. I hope that some of the folks who gave this place five stars actually stumble upon a real piece of pizza at some point in their lives. It will be quite a shocking revelation for them."}
{"text":"So I stayed at the Doubletree resort and was looking for a pizza place that delivered and found this place. When it was delivered I wasn't that impressed with what it looked like but when I ate it I was highly impressed. The pizza was delicious and I was very happy. I don't live on this side of town but if I come back I will definitely come back to this pizza place. Absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible, do not order from this place. Worst pizza and longest wait time ever"}
{"text":"My family and I are in town for a golf tournament, and ordered delivery from Joe's. The person who answered the phone was not very knowledgeable about the menu and I am not sure if English was her first language. We had our food delivered and the order was all wrong except for the cheese steak which wasn't have bad. boneless wings no ranch or blue cheese, ordered meatball calzone or meat calzone and we got cheese calzone with cold marinara.    too bad Crust doesn't deliver."}
{"text":"5 stars for New York style pizza 1 star for Sicilian  I have lived in Old Town for almost 2 years and have been on a mission to find good pizza.  I discovered Joe's a couple of months ago when a friend had ordered it, and I loved it!  It was the New York style pizza, and it was perfect for me-- just greasy enough, lots of cheese, not too much sauce.  The last 2 times I've ordered, I've eaten an entire 18' pizza with only one other person!    BUT...last night my bf and I made the mistake of ordering the Sicilian pizza.  He and I both loved the Sicilan pizza at a place called Jet's pizza prior to moving to Scottsdale, which doesn't have a Jet's.  The Sicilian at Joe's is nothing like Jet's, unfortunately.  It is all crust.  I like thick crust when it's good, but this was just dry, bland, and seriously at least an inch thick.  There was not much cheese or sauce, and, even if there had been, it would still have been overpowered by the crust.  I even tried dipping in ranch, and, still, all I got was crust.  What made it worse was that the Sicilian only came in one size-- 18 x 12!  So, we paid almost $30 for one pizza and just ended up throwing away most of it.    I will keep ordering from Joe's, but, from now on, I'll stick with the New York style pizza."}
{"text":"What a great pizza. Perfectly cooked, Gorgonzola that actually taste like blue cheese.  Mac and cheese bites are a good side.  Great on time delivery and a wonderful meal.  Highly recommended for anyone who is a New York pizza lover.  Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Thanks for messing up my order and charging me $30 for two crappy subs I didn't even order, and the only reason I didn't return the subs is because it was 1am and I just wanted to go home. Your staff is a train-wreck and it really showed when the pressure was put on them."}
{"text":"Horrible chorizo pizza, and horrible wings plus they forgot our ranch dressing! The only good thing about my order was the bottled Coke. Paid $40 for the 3 items and I had to trash the pizza because it was that bad."}
{"text":"We were suppose to eat at the Sandwich place but they had no electricity I guess??? so we ended up here, it was okay, I am from Chicago so I am picky about my pizza, it was not bad but def not my favorite, I am not a fan of reheated pizza so I also am not a fan of Sbarro's either...it was across from hard rock and convenient to go to... I had the salad too, it was a basic salad..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, horrible service.  This is the third time in a row I've been here and received absolutely terrible service. When i walked up to make my order there wasnt even an acknowledgment of my presence. cashier is chewing gum and doesnt make eye contact when speaking. She forgot about my order in the oven so 10 min later after they realized it was burnt she tells me to pick two more pieces.  no apology.  just a blank look and mastication. the same occured for most of the group after me.  excellent pizza but the horrible service will stop me from coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is legit. So so delicious. The crust is perfect, the sauce is amazing, they are generous with the cheese and toppings. There were 5 of us, all from NY (Long Island) and we tried the plain slice, the pepperoni slice, the Hawaiian slice, a 16\" lasagna pie, garlic knots, cheesy garlic sticks (GET THESE!!), a salad with grilled chicken, and the canolis. Everything was great. We are all so happy that we found this place! A little slice of home in the middle of the desert (pun definitely intended!)."}
{"text":"While staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, I had to go to CVS and get some supplies for our hotel room. After shopping there, I stopped by there as I was craving a pizza slice. The lady who took care of me the first time was awesome. I ordered a cheese slice and while there were some in the display, she offered me instead one that just came out of the oven about to be cut. I don't remember her name but her service gets 5 stars as she hooked me up!  The second visit wasn't as good. I got a cheese slice again and this time it was a different person at the counter and well I can taste the difference. Their pizza overall was decent but not anything memorable. Despite that, if we ended up at HRH again I'd still eat there if I'm craving a slice."}
{"text":"I hate that my doctor told me I can't have any carbs because I could eat Joe's everyday. Everytime I drive by I want to stop and buy a slice, or two, or three. Slices are the perfect size for the perfect price. This is probably by far my favorite pizza place. Hands down. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great late night pizza. The line is always out the door, but the pizza is worth the wait and fairly inexpensive. You will definitely be entertained while you wait in line with all the drunk people leaving the clubs making a fool of themselves, and you can see what the person really looks like you were grinding with in the club!"}
{"text":"I ordered salads and pizza from this establishment while spending a few days in Vegas. The salads were fresh and the pizza was hot when it arrived.  The pizza was really good and cooked well done as we requested.  The bonus was the gentleman who delivered the food, he called us 10 minutes before arrival and delivered with a smile."}
{"text":"No matter how snobby you think old-town Scottsdale socialites can be, the truth is they like to get hammered and stuff their faces just like us real human beings. In the indiscriminate hours of 2-4 am, you can dine by the slice, or if you gotta have it fresh like yours truly then reject the premade meal and get yours made-to-order.  $20 for an 18\" with two toppings is a bit pricey by some standards, but after shooting Patron all night like a rich bitch I could overlook it. They're busting out the dough and making my pie FRESH in the middle of the night, so tip them well. Crust is legit, cheese is REAL, stringy mozzarella. Staff is kind and quick; the manager keeps the young guys running around, working hard. This pizza is quality hangover protection."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a slice, the pizza is the perfect consistency with a slight crunch, a large enough slice with thin crust that you do the traditional fold and the tip will drop slightly with the right amount of grease dripping off of (it is definitely not diet food, but it will fulfill your need for a real NY style stop in pizza joint).  My first time I tried the meatball sub, which while not bad really was not memorable.  They have cut outs from Drake's baked goods on the walls, and if they actually sold them it would push them straight to 5 stars for me"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  I came in to pick up a pizza; they'd made the wrong one, but that wasn't the issue.  When I asked that their mistake be reflected in the final price of the order (i.e., that they'd give me a discount for screwing up), I was brought a manager, who very coldly and rudely told me he would not give me any amount off at all.  I should not have had to argue with him about it.  I didn't even get an apology.    To boot, the pizza was quite subpar, very dry.  I used to like this place - the people who worked here were friendly, and the pizza was quite good.  A shame it's gone downhill."}
{"text":"Three stars just because my arteries wouldn't allow me any more than this. It was decent pizza, but let me tell you, I added a good two pounds from just a couple slices.   Catered lunches when I'm on the road are a double edged sword. Tasty, perhaps. Convenient, definitely. Healthy, not a chance. I always have to watch what I eat otherwise I'd be a lot heavier. And Joe's is the type of place that I have to watch out for.  The office manager either didn't count too well or figured that all of us looked skinny and needed to add a few pounds. Because she ordered an entire large pizza for every 1.5 people.   I ate along with about a dozen others, and we finished off maybe 3 pizzas total. And a lot of these guys were on the larger side, too! But the stuffed pizza with sausage and ham and pepperoni and whatever else was just too massive. Delicious and glistening with grease, but oh so divine. Too bad there was still half a day left and I had to stave off a nap for another four hours."}
{"text":"Pizza was outstanding !! Guy at the front was super outgoing and helped us put our order together and saved us money. Quality at it best! You can tell this Pizza is made with LOVE. Garlic Knots and salad were banging too. I highly recommend Joe's . I found a hidden gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow, food is amazing but the customer service at this location is TERRIBLE! Drive to the other location on Paradise. Good customer service is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice!  I took mine to go and the pizza is pretty delicious, but the lady who took my order wasn't exactly friendly.  Aren't all pizza staff supposed to be over friendly?  She wasn't.  She should be working at the DMV instead.  Anyway, I ordered the Hawaiian and it was bomb!  The rest of their selection looked really good.  They had about 10 different kinds to choose from, and the slices are pretty big.  I'd love to order a fresh whole pizza sometime.  I love NY style pizza."}
{"text":"They ain't ever showed up. They are the worst. It use to be my favorite. You let me down Joe. #gusforlife"}
{"text":"this place is amazing. stoped here and got the 19 inch buffalo chicken pizza.  the whole pie cost me around 25 bucks. the chicken was amazing. huge chunks of real chicken. just the right blend of cheese and sauce too. seeing how its only a 5 minute walk from my place. i will be back"}
{"text":"Pizza slices are $3.50 each which seems kind of steep to me. Pizza was OK. There's different options to chose from in the display case. I liked the fact they had big shakers of parmesan, oregano and chili flakes. Service was quick. I don't understand the whole tip jar thing though. I'm being served a slice of pizza from the display case to the register that I just paid $3.50 for not including tax."}
{"text":"The reason they got a 3 star is because the cashier was friendly. 1 large pizza snd 2 drinks was almost 40.00. One of the worst pizzas we have had in a while. Very oily and not much flavor. Plus the restaurant was very small had l don't think the air conditioning was working very well. Try little ceaser it's a better pizza for a lot less money."}
{"text":"Joe's is awesome. It's best as a late night munch after a night of clubbing and drinking and scamming (or whatever you do in that area), but they also deliver during the day. I have eaten at Joe's many times late at night, but today we had it delivered and thought I should finally review it. A full fresh pie is a little different from ordering a reheated slice at the counter, right?  The pizza is good for NY style. Nice flavors and decent ingredients. You get a lot of pizza for the money... particularly if you pick it up yourself - but 20 bucks delivered for an 18 inch one topping (including tip) isn't bad.   They were pretty nice when I called in my order which can be a bit of a contrast to the experience you get when you show up in person at 2am, but how else would they be expected to handle a line of hungry drunk clubtards going out the door? I was told 30 minutes (which would've been nice), but it took closer to an hour. I've worked pizza delivery when I was a kid and that kind of thing is understandable. No big deal. Now, if it happens every time I order from them, I might start to get bummed.  The pizza here isn't quite 5 star to me, but it's close."}
{"text":"Great Pizza.  As a New Yorker who has tried many places over the years that CLAIM to be real New York Pizza, this place is true New York Pizza.  You know a place is successful when another pizza place ( Gus's pizza ) moves in across the street trying to ride Joes coat tails..   As a foodie, I know Joes uses the high quality cheese, that is one thing that I have noticed many places fail on using with New York Pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible experience thanks to the girl that couldn't find my online order and basically accused me of just trying to get free pizza.  Rude.  Learn how to handle these situations with common sense."}
{"text":"Staff is very rude. Pizza looks like it has been sitting out for hours. The cashier claimed to be the \"assistant manager\" yet she is cashiering. Nonetheless, I asked her to heat up my pizza  hot due to the cheese forming a hard carter like surface for being out for so long and she failed to even do that correctly. This place does not match-up to the hype."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight based off of a recommendation my husband got doing Postmates. I'll give it 4 stars.   The place is really cute. It's pretty small, but that gives it a homey feeling. It's decorated cute. My 2 year old loved the Statue of Liberty in the front. I was also super happy that the Fast and the Furious was on one of the tv's :)  We ordered mac n cheese bites, a small white spinach pizza, a small super meaty pizza, and two drinks. This came to $43! Say what??? This place is way overpriced.   The mac n cheese bites came out quickly. We decided we wanted to dip them in marinara sauce, but my husband got a weird look from the person behind the counter when he asked for it. He felt uncomfortable. The bites were pretty good!  The pizzas came out pretty quickly too. My white spinach pizza was very good. The crust was delicious, and the mozzarella cheese was fresh. Two thumbs up.   My husband says his was okay. He wants to go back and try a calzone. He was also bummed they don't serve beer.  We want to go back, and take my son! Good location, cute place, and good food!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and I am always reminded on why I don't eat here as often. As a former native NYer  I love eating pizza. The pizza here is just ok. Nothing extraordinary. In fact it lacks  real NY flavor. However my issue isn't with the pizza but more with the price . At $4.16 a slice ,it's way over priced. The only time I ever paid for an over priced pizza is in Manhattan. This location in Vegas so it's not justified by any means. They even have a slice special like they used to. At least you felt your getting something. My suggestion at $4.16 it should include a small drink or make the pizza so amzing it justifies the price. In fact there is other pizza places near by that offer 2 slices and a drink for around 5 bucks."}
{"text":"One  of the worst pizza I've ever tasted and experienced. Ordered pizza for pickup with ham and pineapple, and when we got to the hotel, the ham was on the entire pizza and the pineapple was just on half. Here  are other things I experienced:  1. Super salty pizza. 2. Shiesty on toppings and sauce. 3. Sheisty on the cheese, peppers, and paper plates. 4. Crust was slightly burnt.  Overall the pizza quality and taste was not good. Will not come back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is Good, I tend to stop here before I head back to LA. It's not bad on the stomach, and the quality of pie was surprising to say the least.   I have been here 4 times, and I will be back"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, service was okay and well my experience was meh! Overpriced everything. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I had it for the first time on Friday January 20th and liked it so much I went back again the next day. The place is clean and I like how they have their menu set up above the register and on take out menus for convenience. They also have some interested decor on a wall with a lot of superhero art and vintage signs.       The first time I got a monster vegetarian cal-zone. It had to much onions on it however the cheese and crust were perfect. this made me curious how their pizza must taste, hence my prompt return on Saturday.  Their pizza was great and I love their fries. Its hard for me to find real fresh fries and they had them. Overall I enjoy it and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Chicken parm was filling and delicious. Pizza was pretty good but the crust was a little too large. Nice little hole in the wall feel. And a soda machine with a very large variety of drinks."}
{"text":"Is that spaghetti coming out of my pizza? Oh yes it is!!! Spaghetti and mushrooms with pepperoni and bacon I added the peppers to it. I have been here twice and both times after 10:00 and there are always people in there. They have funny pictures on the wall to keep you entertained while you wait. They have more than just pizza, but so far that's all I have tried and I have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town ! We live in California and every time we come out to Las Vegas  is a must to eat here!"}
{"text":"After leaving a beach party extremely parched and very sleepy, I felt it was time to dig in to the carbs! I found this place that came highly recommended.  First of all I can tell you how much it cost for a slice of pizza because there were no prices listed. What I can say is that two slices of pizza with a bunch of toppings came out to around $14.99 with two drinks. So by doing the math is not bad however it's not a New York price for New York slice of pizza. I found the sauce to be kind of bland and much to be desired. I was expecting some oregano sometime or something Italian. I didn't find it here.  The good thing about this place is that it stays open till 5 a.m.. So if you left the club and you want something to eat that's quick this is definitely the spot for you. Although I enjoyed my meal and it absorbs all of the adult beverage that I consumed by the pool, I don't think I would be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Joe's Pizza is delicious. But Joe is mean. And scary. His pizza joint is right across the street from a nightclub, so he can't expect his customers to be meek little mice that eat their pie in silence, right? WRONG! I came in with what one might describe as a rowdy group of girls on an early evening and Joe immediately started yelling at us to be quiet. We became a little annoyed and may have mentioned the fact that he can't really expect his patrons not to laugh or talk loudly and he promptly kicked us out. That's right, I have been kicked out of Joe's Pizza. But I'd still go back, it's good stuff."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing this pizza. My best friend is Hungarian and has raved about this place and the ownership (they are Hungarian).  I am writing this review on behalf of her. It was her first time at this location, she ordered carry out (she usually orders from Paradise location). 2 LG special with a 2 L coke which came out to $40 (not the cheapest pizza place).  One pizza was spinach and goat cheese (brilliant) and the other, mushroom and roasted red pepper, no cheese.  We got to her house, and the roasted peppers have seeds and are spicy. Not a little, but very. That pizza was for her daughter, who loves roasted SWEET peppers, which is what you get when you order \"roasted peppers\" anywhere else.  She called the location, to let them know they should at least let their customers know, \"Hey, our peppers are spicy, is that okay?\" Instead, she got someone on the phone who barely spoke english. He put her on hold, then a while later \"Alberto\" or \"Arturo\" answered the phone, and asked what she wants to order. Obviously, communication was lacking.  She explained again, what the problem was. His response was \"Oh yea, our peppers are mildly spicy\" and \"people don't usually have a problem\" \"we didn't know it was for a child\".... HORRIBLE customer service. No apologies, no \"can we remake it for you?\", no remorse, or even taking ownership of the problem.   We have both been working in the food service industry for over a decade each and especially for Las Vegas standard this place is seriously lacking. Small businesses especially, can't afford to afford a customer base, because as we all know, one bad experience gets spread faster than a good one.   This customer could have been saved by a simple apology. Especially since displayed by the cash register, was a signage that said \"Joe's is committed to pleasing its customers\"."}
{"text":"This pigeon walks into a pizza joint and...  So I stopped into Joe's for a quick lunch between appointments.  I had the 2 cheese slices and a drink deal, about $6.50.  The slices are decent sized so 2 was plenty for me.  Pretty good.  Not quite the NY style I am accustomed too, if the crust were a bit thinner and the edge not so thick and it had a good coal or wood fired taste...that would be perfect.  Still, pretty good, I'll go back.  Oh, about the pigeon.  The front door was standing open and this sketchy  looking pigeon wandered in and began poking around by the trash can and front tables looking for crumbs.  Serious authenticity points for the mangy pigeon.  I don't know if it's on the payroll or just a regular.  Someone came from behind the counter and chased it out but it came right back so it was obviously from NYC."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok I've had better, mozzarella sticks are over priced for the amount and size they are, wings tasted like they were cooked in a microwave plus cashier was rude to my brother when he asked for his money back cause she added a salad on his order that he didn't ask for not somewhere I would come back and eat or recommend"}
{"text":"Used to get their pizza quite often. It tasted pretty good. The last time we ordered it for pick up and saw pizza boxes stored on the floor. Never went  back! That's just wrong!"}
{"text":"I just got back from this place and we couldn't stop talking about it in the car on the ride back to work that I swore i would write a review.   Joe's is located on the South end of the Beltz Mall off Las Vegas Blvd (AKA Premium Outlets South). Next to 5 Guys burgers.   Their lunch special is 2 slices of pizza (pepperoni or cheese) for $8 OR 1 slice (pepperoni or cheese) and a side salad for $8. Drinks are 1/2 off during lunch.   We walked out paying about $18 for 2 people for lunch. Not bad, not cheap either.  BUT!!!!!!!!!! This pizza is SO worth the price. And we only had pepperoni! There were more pizza selections and subs and sandwiches too. But pizza is what they are known for so thats what we had.   The space is a little confusing but I'm here to clarify it for you all first timers. Since there is a ton of people inside, it may cause panic for some. So here is the drill:  1. Walk in and head to the front counter.   2. Order your pizza (don't forget to ask about the daily special)  or meal selection. They will take the pizza slice if that's all you are ordering and heat it up or you in the oven while you pay.  3. Pay and give them your name to call it when your order is ready.    4. Fill your drink up with their Coca cola mutli-selection dispenser. I love this! They have Fruit punch!   5. Sit where-ever you want. Your name will be called and you can come get your order up at the front counter.   6. Enjoy!   We absolutely love this place. We were in and out, back at my desk in the 30min we have for lunch. The food was pipping hot when we got it and the Parmesan in their dispensers is REAL PARMESAN, not the fake confetti some places have.   You all must vis"}

{"text":"This is now a Vegas tradition for The Morning After. Superb, crispy chewy crust that is nice and thick, while the rest of the slice thins out from there.  Pizza's are made fresh in front of you and placed behind the glass, with a rotating order of variety.  Wish there was one in California!"}
{"text":"The 2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge:     6/100   Recently went to this pizza joint just before shopping at Belz, the South Premium Outlets. When I walked in, I didn't feel like I was in Vegas. It felt like a mom and pop pizza joint on the east coast. I liked the homey vibe and decor.  Few things about this place:  - walk up and order at the counter. - they have pizzas already made, order by slice -- they heat it up in the oven before serving it to you. - option to order a whole pie, but it would be a bit of a wait.  - all you can eat option, $9.99  - punch card for single slices   Ordered the Meat Pie by the slice, filled with toppings top to bottom. Layered with pepperoni, sausage, ham, meatball, topped w/ mozzarella & bacon. It's a thick & hearty slice, could easily get full off one slice. I liked it. Some slices were filled w/ spaghetti, which made it more filling yet not satisfying. I didn't like it. Prefer it without spaghetti. Don't rely on my photo, it looked bigger in person.   It's an okay place. Try it for yourself. It's not pizza I would go out of my way to get or crave, so I'm not sure if I would be back again."}
{"text":"Ok... sooo, this is my 2nd review of this place and I'm happy to say it improved!  Last time I gave 3 stars, with the chicken alfredo being excellent, but the lasagna pizza and delivery experience being bad.  THIS TIME, I tried a pizza that was half white truffle mushroom and half frat boy.  The white truffle was a little disappointing, as there was so much bacon.. it overpowered any taste of white truffle or mushrooms.  The frat boy tasted great!!  The only thing, the type of ingredients on it sweat when heated, so the crust gets a little soggy... it's not like that's anything they could fix though.. that's just expected with this kind of pizza.  It will be great as leftover pizza heated in the oven though!  I ordered the chicken alfredo again, as I was sooo impressed with it last time.. kinda wanted to see if that was a fluke, but nope, it was sooo good again!!  I add mushrooms to it also.. and heated up as leftovers.. omg, I'm in heaven!!  Delivery was 5 stars this time.. fast, friendly, and no trying to trick me into double tipping with a machine like last time.  So yeh.. I'll be ordering from here again!  :)"}
{"text":"I would have to say this pizzeria is closest to nyc pizza you can get in this part of town.  Nice big thin slices and relativity cheap.  But I sure do miss the real nyc pizza though."}
{"text":"BOYCOTT JOES DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR.  I've been a loyal Joe's customer for years and recommended them on taste alone but their service is horrible.  The pizza is a very thin crust thin cheese ny style. I recommend going to Gus Pizza across from them because their service is much better.  I ordered pick up via yelp eat24 and when I came in after my order status was done it was full 1 topping and not half and half like I ordered. I pointed this out and the cashier \"Isarel\" (older tan) said it was my order. I had to read the order (2nd half pep) to him 3x to get him to believe me. Also didn't believe me I had 2 side sauces and it's also on the order... They took a cheese and added pepperoni to it... Guess someone else's order will be late. I told them not to rush it and undercook it and it's undercooked yep hope I don't get food poisoning.  I then said can I get anything for having to wait? He said no and Joe the owner, would also say no and refused to give me his public owners contact info to ask. Joe came in as I was waiting btw and he didn't say anything. Told me to come back tomorrow 9 to 2 to talk to Joe. I asked again can I get a water bottle, a drink, garlic knots or a coupon for next time! I was settling for coupons that he HAD IN A DRAW fam! He had them! Refused to give me anything for their error.  Joe is there 9a to 2p allegedly if any of you want to talk to him.  I'm shocked and appalled this inconsiderate behavior has not shut them down with the BBB. This is not the first time Joes messed up my order, overcharged me, tried to double charge me or was downright rude. If you believe in the moral good don't go to Joes and maybe they'll get the message to CARE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEM MONEY."}

It took apprx 35-45min from order to lobby for my pizza to arrive :)  I went with a 12in White Spinach Pizza ($14.24): Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Spinach, Ricotta & Fresh Garlic. Pretty good! Wish it was a bit heavier on the garlic, but the pepperoni and spinach were great.  I am sure I will order from them again.  Great choice if you want to eat in your room :)"}
{"text":"Maybe the Best Pizza in the Scottsdale as of 2011.   My five star rating is based on multiple awesome pizza purchases.  The pizza is so good  ive never had anything else."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here.  They say pizza by the slice on the signage, but I'm pretty sure the pizza slices have been sitting out for at least 4 hours.  A couple of them had been reheated multiple times....or were burned the first time.  The crust was black on several of the pizzas.  It was busy, but mostly families with young kids.  The pasta looked good, but based on the pizza display I will never be eating here....the tropical smoothie cafe next door makes flatbreads quite quickly.  They were able to make one without chicken for me so it's definitely fresh.  I suggest you give them your business instead."}

{"text":"When I was a kid, I absolutely hated pizza (and donuts, what).  However, somewhere within the last few years, that has completely changed and I will now crawl 3 blocks in the middle of summer, around Club Jersey Shore to get a slice of pizza here.   I've never been to New York but the level of friendless from the staff here is a good indication that this place is probably legit.    That being said, you can guess how great the pizza is if that doesn't deter me from shamelessly shoving two slices down my throat while still sweating from my walk to the restaurant.  Honestly, the pizza is amazing and it doesn't sit like a rock in your stomach after you inhale it (which you will, go for the pepperoni).  Plus, I'm serious about Club Jersey Shore, there were less neon shirts in the 90's than the club rats were wearing that gravitated towards this tribute to douchery.

When it got there it was cold and the delivery guy couldn't care less. Next time I ordered there biggest pizza and received a medium. No refund or anything. I called the manager and haven't received a call back in 5 days."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!! Staff always friendly!!! Try the meat pie, or spaghetti pizza, or the lasagna pizza!!! But can never go wrong with their award winning pepperoni pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the goat cheese pizza and it's AMAZING! Can't wait to come back for more. My son, picky with pizza, got the regular pepperoni and cheese and ate it all."}
{"text":"I'll admit the pizza is decently good.  Not the best but not bad.  Good enough to eat when you are drunk from the Rebels winning a basketball game at the T&M.  Of course I had to try it sober so I hopped in yesterday and ordered a slice and a small soda.  $7 later I'm sorry to say it was not what I expected.  The pizza was still decently good but the slice I got for $3.15 was tiny to say the least.  I think it took all of three bites to finish (crust and all).  I'll be back when I'm drunk from a Rebel game, but sober no way not at that price."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tenders.  My friend had put the order in via phone and when the delivery was received, I thought my dish was a joke.  Turns out there were 2 sizes and my friend ordered the small (ie. you get 3 strips and a few celery sticks.  Good thing I questioned my friend before I called to complain lol  One of my friends ordered the Calzone pizza which was huge.  This is the dish to order!  Overall, everything tasted okay, nothing was cold."}
{"text":"A-OK pizza. Especially when it's 2:30am and you really want something to eat. J and I have ended up here on many a night after bar hopping/clubbing. The pizza to me is really only so-so, but when all you want is some kind of delicious greasy feast, this place will seem like the best pizza you've ever eaten. Especially if you completely cover it in red pepper flakes and parmesan like I do. There line is huge once all the bars/clubs start to close. But the service here is pretty speedy, so don't despair too much. You'll be enjoying that folded slice of delicious greasy NY pizza in no time!"}
{"text":"I've been craving pizza all day. I am grateful you made the trip even though my hotel sends you away, I wouldn't of ordered had I known this in advance. I'm sure it's stated somewhere and I missed it.  I'm slightly sad because I ordered extra marinara sauce for dipping my garlic knots but instead I have two ranch dips.  My Hawaiian pizza is good, and hits the spot. While it doesn't look as yummy (brick house cooked) as the pictures, it does look beautifully crafted and clean."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza you can get in the area.  Whether it's late night, or delivery, you're going to get delicious pizza, crispy but not floppy crust, and a mouthful of gooey cheese that sits well, is flavorful and doesn't drip.  People write a lot about how it's too greasy, etc etc, if that turns you off, then just go to Crust or something!  I think people who enjoy Joe's know what they're getting and are big fans of it.    Get some!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just moved here and ordered a pizza based on the photo's and reviews. It was better than I expected, normally delivery isn't that great.  I have lived back East and yes, they nailed it! I got a medium pizza with eggplant (done correctly), sausage, peppers, olives and garlic.  I found out the owners are from New Jersey and they managed to duplicate an East coast pizza in Arizona! Thanks for bringing back memories.  Best pizza in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great food. Super clean. Nice & neat. Decent prices. Friendly service. Love the Coke machine too where you can choose tons of flavors! My favorite was the crust on the pizza. Will def be coming here again. :)"}
{"text":"Found these guys here on yelp ordered a cheese pizza (delivered). They had a special with chicken wings, so I said \"what the heck, I'll get those too\".   I got the hot wings...they were ok.  I wouldn't say they were ridiculously hot just hot enough to make you wanna drink beer.  And that was fine...  The pizza however was amazing!   I was pleasantly surprised to know that somebody in Phoenix actually knows how to make pizza!!   I would definitely have the cheese pizza again.  The crust was perfect.and the cheese was tasty."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Especially considering the portion sizes are very stingy (mozzarella sticks and wings) and the pizza was really greasy."}
{"text":"Called in a pick up order on Friday night. Ordered the pepperoni and jalapeño and a meat lovers pizza along with the chicken pesto sandwich and a side of fries. The food was all really good the fries I believe were home made. The only downfall were the prices. They seemed a bit overpriced for what the pizza sizes were. Don't get me wrong the food was good but it could be a bit cheaper. I don't feel like I got my money's worth for what we paid."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza !!!  They have pizza with meatball slices.  How New York.  I can't buy a pie without eating the whole thing.  Which is why I have to do major situps!!!!!"}
{"text":"A great \"cheap\" meal while in Vegas.    Tired of paying the exorbitant prices on the strip and in the hotel?  Drive a couple blocks to Joes and have a great slice of pizza!  We've been coming here over the last couple years as one of our meals while in Vegas (usually the first night when we fly in) as there is a CVS right next door and we pick up water, snacks and other essentials before we head to the hotel.    On this most recent trip, I got the meat pie and my wife had the Hawaiian slice.  Both were really good and served up hot.  We also split a garlic cheesy bread which was pretty much a big ass pizza with only garlic and cheese.    Overall great pizza and a decent price."}
{"text":"I was having one of those really fat days. I downed 2 sliders from the slider truck and was still hungry and a slice of cheese pizza sounded good. They heated up my pizza and all, but it definitely tasted reheated. It wasn't *bad*, but not particularly good either. I'd rank it above Sbarro but well below Metro as far as greasy NY-style type pizzas go."}
{"text":"Best pizza , open till 4:00am on weekends.  I feel like I am in New York having pizza."}
{"text":"MEAT PIE pizza was amazing! And that's it lol my boyfriend ordered the reg supreme and it was the same taste as everyone's else's... We ordered fries but waited quite awhile and they weren't even seasoned, very plain."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice is nice and the price is right. I didn't hate it but I didn't exactly love it. It was somewhat of a let down given the hype but I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Joe's New York Pizza is great. The menu is really good and authentic. It is great if you go clubbing in scottsdale and then get hungry! The pizza and pasta dishes are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Tried them for delivery tonight - and a good call it was, they were here in less than 20min.  Large 18\" Pepperoni Pizza with a 2-liter of Coke set me back $22 (not bad for the good stuff). Huge slices, thin crust, fresh parmesan cheese in little plastic cups, crushed red peppers, plenty of cheese and grease.  Overall a great break from the predictable taste of Domino's and Papa Johns."}
{"text":"Well, here I am again in Vegas for the garment trade show. After a long day of working at the booth, you get too tired and a bit \"cranky\" to stand in a long line for food, competing with all the other vendors to get food. So, i decided to take a quick drive., for a quick bite, just enough for me to have food in my stomach to hibernate till morning. New York style thin crust pizza seems plain and simple. I came here to order by the slice, and it filled the need. Nothing different than any other independent pizza places i've gone too. It met my expectations, as i just ordered a couple of choices to go, and gulped it down as i drove back to my hotel. For me, meeting and fulfilling my needs and expectations get a 3/5 star.  Kinda like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before bed. It takes care of my need."}
{"text":"When your craving for quick good \"new york\" pizza. This is your best chance outside the las vegas blvd. A lot of pizza toppings & cooked perfectly. Yes, try this pizza place. To-go or dine in."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hyatt Place across the street and went here a few times for my pizza fix.  All in all, it wasn't bad but not great.  I definitely enjoy the Pizza in Chicago more but what can ya do? The slices are huge but mine had a little more sauce than what i cared for.  No big deal though.  The real standout was the calzone.  This thing is a monster. I had it stuffed with feta cheese and again, a little more sauce than I like but thats just me being picky.  I had their chicked sandwhich and I was really not impressed with it.  It was advertised as being chicken tenders but it was actually grilled strips.  My friend and I both got one and mine tasted awful while he said his was fine. I'd definitely try the pizza again but avoid the chicken."}
{"text":"I am so blessed to have this place near my house.  It's the first thing we ate while we were moving in and it's going to be in our lives for a long time to come.  First off, it's pretty expensive for pizza but it's worth it.  A large pie is huge and for a big guy like me, 2 slices is all I can eat.  A combo pizza will run you $20.  The sandwiches are cheap and delicious.  The wings are decent, but not great.  Maybe they taste better when you eat inside.  We always get delivery.  I love alot of things about NYC.  The 2 most important things (besides my sister) are pizza and bagels.  I am happy Joe's NY covers the pizza side.  Oh and they deliver LAAAAATE Thurs-Sun."}
{"text":"Joes never fails when you are getting off work late at night and need a slice! And they always give a discount if you work at one of the clubs nearby."}
{"text":"Ordered a meatball sandwich with french fries for delivery; couldn't be more disappointed. The sandwich was soggy to the point the bread had disintegrated into mulch. Did they soak this thing in a bathtub for a few hours before delivering it? The fries tasted as though they'd been left to sit for much longer than they should have, and were also very soggy--my guess is that they sat in a pool of grease all night. I won't order from here again, and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"The pizza is sold by the slice or whole. My daughters got single slices pepperoni and meat. The slices were warmed up in the oven which I thought was cool. I ordered the meat calzone. The girls said the slices were good.  My calzone was tasty. I liked the nostalgic plates on the wall.  The only disappointing part of my visit was the customer service. I didn't feel that I was valued as a customer. They was no warm greeting, I amlost felt as if they preferred I was interpreting them. My daughter stood at the register waiting to order a side of blue cheese and she ignored until she spoke up and the employee seemed distracted."}
{"text":"Awful!  Old cold pizza that they just reheated in the oven. They had a bunch of employees in the back standing around and took forever to get service and greeted. Cashier was great, old man that got me my slice of pizza wearing a tow truck t-shirt had a bad attitude. Won't recommend them too anyone. All you pay for is rude service and over priced cold pizza."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times before. I think they forgot to put the sauce on my pizza this time. But then again I usually go in and don't do delivery. Its cheese bread with pepperoni on it. And to top it off the middle of the pizza is still raw,"}
{"text":"Great pizza was told it was ok we thought it was some of the best pizza we have had. Good price as well."}
{"text":"The guy stated it was a 12 inch Italian sub? Fried meatball was a frozen store bought michalina garbage. If you order salad you get a green romaine blank salad but wait I ordered a Sub . A tasteless Romaine sub 0 flavor ,searching for the utter explosion?  (Which I did not receive) dry go back to the nasty as the strip peeling off something of substance.  disappointed but again in Vegas you would think you could have somewhat decent sandwich?  Lights,  beer boxers and God forbid you don't put 20$ IN THE machine free drinks over!.memo not everyone is a wife ife beater  womanizing May weather or Paugeaou . A rant I will never win why you may ask I s because all the watched, drank , gambled was from the free wheeling Obama phone children handout people who Obama promise the fight of century needless to say forget about it. The food was pathetic made me think why Vegas will be for the EBT life suckered of the A World. OBAMA HAS YOU SEALED SIGN AND DELIVERED. ..."}
{"text":"Went in and had their fried meatballs and pepperoni pizza. I really liked the pizza and the marinara they served with the meatballs was excellent. The meatballs themselves were ok. Would love to go back and try a calzone."}
{"text":"One word... Well, actually two words... Greasy/  overpriced. I had pizza delivered to my hotel on Saturday it was over $55 for two large pizzas or 10 wings and bread. Absolutely would not order from again"}
{"text":"This place is the best pizza I ever had in my life and all the other food is very very good the waitress Lynda is very kind and the owner joe is also I will be there at least 4 times a week for there great food. I give them  stars if I could. Everyone please please please go try Joe's pizza and tell them Brian Williams recommend y'all"}
{"text":"Ordered this late night after a concert the delivery was about what they said maybe a little late but after trying my first piece I was pleased I'll definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Well HUGE disappointment.  Really NOT good food.    Pizza with tomatoes and spinach sounded awesome.  It might have been good if not delivered ice cold and soggy an hour later.  Actually, no...it was pretty flavorless even when we reheated it.  A single pizza with a side of Mac and cheese $40 plus a tip.  The Mac and cheese was literally a few noodles and some watery cheese sauce.  VERY Gross.    It seems that many of the positive reviews are from post-party people. I get that.  With enough alcohol anything can pass as good food.  But don't try this garbage sober. You'll wish you were drunk.   Absolutely NOT worth it.  Also, could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers?  Apparently that would have been too great a cost for them to spare a single pack of Parmesan cheese.    I have no problem paying a premium for really good food.  Not the case here.  It is sad when I wish I had ordered cardboard dominos instead -- it would have tasted better and cost half as much."}
{"text":"It was ok. I've had better. Also expensive but delivered within reasonable time frame."}
{"text":"Great customer service on phone and quick delivery. Had the Alfredo pasta was terrible. The pizza was okay too much crust some what skimpy on toppings. Salad had the dressing mixed with the entire thing. Which doesn't save well. So for salad to go get dressing on the side.  You would be better off to get pizza by the slice see if U like it."}
{"text":"I was raised and still live in NYC and this pizza in no way, shape, or form, resembles that of an NYC pizza. The pizzas are decent though, although the crust is amongst the worst I've ever had. The subs aren't so great either, worst of all is the caprese sub. The appetizers are very good and the salads are decent. Can't really complain for a place that's open late and delivers."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great atmosphere, bad prices. They're a bit greedy with the price and they're small for $16.95 has tiny slices."}
{"text":"I was impressed. The good was tasty. Ordered a pizza, wings and fries to go. The food stayed hot when I got home. French fries and wings stayed crispy and not soggy like most places when you take it to go. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"4 stars when I was drunk, but this place probably only deserves 3.   There was a girl fight outside this pizza shop when we were waiting in line LOL. Food AND entertainment? That's like the whole package. Jk, the pizza was aite. It came out luke warm and for $3.50 a slice, that's pretty pricey. But hey, it gets the job done after drinking all night.  White pizza and red pizza are both good- can't really go wrong with either. The line was out the door but it moved by pretty fast, probably cause they don't heat up the pizza slices for you. The tables are really dirty and there's trash everywhere but honestly who gives a fuck? It's 2am, you take care of your drunchies, and ktfo at home. Probably wouldn't come here on my own during the day tho."}
{"text":"So, this place is within walking distance from my job. I come here often. i am not biased just because it is close... because i felt like trying their competitor basically next door and there pizza SUCKED! . I love that i can just walk into joe's and get a slice. The pizza is consistent always baked to a T and its really a bang for your buck especially during the lunch special. I strongly recommend coming here especially when your bar hopping! Or, if your just a local looking for a quick bite for lunch OR dinner. Please GO! you wont regret it!!!"}
{"text":"We were on the way to the airport and were a bit early, so we decided to get a quick bite. I had seen their ad on Facebook and said, let's try it. We got a couple of slices, It was a warmed up slices, but seriously was great tasting pizza. The crust had that crunch and the sauce had that great taste of oregano with a lasting taste of pretty close to perfection. I'm a NYC boy, Italian and I make my own dough. Try it, you'll love it"}
{"text":"um yeah, besides the drunken hidden gem in the Cosmo, this is the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas.    They have like 10 pies already made, so you can whip in there, their ready in like 5 mins, eat and get on with your life.  I had a slice and a salad A+"}
{"text":"Maybe more like 3.5 stars. I think it would've been better if I ordered a fresh pie, but I opted to order the pre-cooked slices that just needed to be re-heated since it was late, and I just wanted to get my food and leave.  There was a huge selection of slices to choose from.  I think at least 8 different types of pizzas. They were okay, but probably would've been better if they were made fresh. I thought the prices were okay too...  a little over $10 for 2 specialty slices (buffalo chicken and tomato basil) and a bottle of water. The chicken on the buffalo chicken was dry since it was sitting all day...  the tomato basil tasted much better.  The plus is that the slices were a good size."}
{"text":"Pizza is not all that great!!! Customer service is bad as well. I hate sbarros and sbarros is better!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! The people are usually nice & helpful.  We live near Nellis AFB so this place isn't close to us but we come on this side of town just for the pizza!  Wish they would open up a shop over close to us!  That would be awesome! (Hint, hint) ;)"}
{"text":"I walked over for slice at lunch today and realized that I hadn't reviewed Joe's ! What a horrible oversight! Well, oversight corrected. There aren't that many places in Scottsdale (even in this gritty urban jungle where I live, called Old Town), to walk over and get a slice at lunch. That's all I've ever had at Joe's...I know they have sandwiches, calzones, spaghetti, etc., but I just wanted a slice. I will have to try the other stuff one of these days (so many places, so little time). Joe's does good job. It's not Manhattan, but a slice here will fill you up. They do a good job with toppings, and the cheese to sauce to toppings to grease ratio is just right (the pizza creases up just right for eating). If you ask them to make your slice well done, they leave it in the oven for a little extra time and that gives the crust a little more crunch, for those of us that like that sort of thing. Nice people behind the counter and the place is clean, has a few tables outside for sitting and eating on nice days. And, finally, a big slice of pizza and drink only sets you back about $4.50. It's good, cheap eats for lunch!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza here and I wasn't too impressed.  The crust was soggy and floppy.  The cheese fell off of the pizza which made it hard to eat.  But, don't get me wrong, I still ate the pizza and it tasted okay cold the next morning.  But, I couldn't see myself ordering another pie from here again, as there are many pizza joints that I feel are much better."}
{"text":"Delicious. Love the garlicy flavor in the sauce. The crust is perfectly thin and crispy. Not too much cheese more about the toppings. Really tasty ranch dressing. Quick and easy. Great place for a piece of pizza. Also the staff was friendly and accommodating. They added an additional topping to my slice!"}
{"text":"I actually really love the food here. The garlic knots are probably one of the best things to try if you haven't already tried them. They are perfectly cooked and have never been overdone. They have a nice doughy center and taste amazing. I normally hate mom and pop shops however when I first came here their pizza and sides were one of the best things I've ever had. Even their wings were great. Honestly for the garlic knots alone I would go all the time.   However, the reason they have 4 stars is cause their service sucks. The employees are extremely rude and condescending. Even after being condescending one of the times they lost our order and we ended up waiting there for almost over an hour. Finally when I approached them they didn't say sorry they just still kept a rude attitude and gave us our food. I keep coming back because the food is great. But the service is really bad. It's been like that almost every time We have gone in. If the employees had a better attitude they would have 5 stars for me but if I have to rate the restaurant as a whole their employees make it a bad experience.  The restaurant is located off of Las Vegas Blvd. have not been to the other location.      Hi Peter , thank you so much for your response and concern. It was in the middle of the week around 5 or 6 and it wasn't busy at all at the time."}
{"text":"Loved the service from the time we walked in! Prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly! Always love finding new pizza places in town and this location is not only convenient, it's also the best pizza place in town!"}
{"text":"Guys ... its NY style pizza .. If you gotta problem ... Git outta heeeeere! Its bread sauce cheese and toppings, new york style .. meaning just shut up and eat it and quit complaining! Joe's is a classic NY style pizza spot.   Stop by for a slice, grab a drink, quit bitching and Fuggedddhaboutit!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Vegas, we have to eat at Joes. I always get a calzone with spinach, mushrooms and sausage. Tonight's calzone is delicious, as expected. Mmmmmm....!"}
{"text":"Had a pizza craving tonight but was too lazy to get in my car since my favorite pizza joint does not deliver.  So -- I went online and ordered from Joe's NY Pizza.  I wasn't sure if they would deliver since we are 7 miles away from the nearest location BUT I was excited when the order went through!  We ordered the Gourmet Pepperoni - award winning! and the Manhattan Loaded!  Both were extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"To start  I'll say This- I hope you have an appetite  And a lot of money because the pizza here is big, filling, and expensive. To be honest there are probably other places you can  go in las Vegas for good new York style pizza but this is one of. The best I've had.   However the area the location is in isn't so great (on paradise close to the strip) so be prepared for crack heads and tourists alike. Also be prepared for a wait since this place usually has a small wait at the least to order plus for your food to get to you.  The pizza itself is really good, puffy crusts and large slices.  They have a good variety of different slices of pizza from vegetarian to meat lovers to plain cheese. I had a cheese pizza and a chicken pesto pizza and both were really good. I would go back here for sure."}
{"text":"YES YES YES. BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS! 10/10 recommend. We got a pepperoni pizza delivered to our hotel, It does take about an hour to get to you, but it's worth it. Don't think about going anywhere else but here for your pizza delivery needs!"}
{"text":"I gotta give my server Kris. H a huge shoutout for really taking care of us. She was very attentive to me and my family.  We ordered cheese sticks and pizza. Food was hot and made perfect!   What I look for in service is: make sure you get my order right, make sure my drinks don't sit empty and clear trash away so my table isn't left nasty. She did a great job. Will deff return. Thank you :-)"}
{"text":"I've had a \"combo\" pizza after a couple of drinks but I'd like to say that it's pretty darn good. It's NY style pizza and better than across the street. One of the options was an everything vegetarian pizza and I asked if they can throw some pepperoni slices on it which they agreed to. It cost about $4 which is reasonable and with the taste... close enough to the north east slice ;)"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good, but not the best. Definitely worth a try. Pass on the garlic knots, they're pretty bland and covered in raw chunks of garlic...unless you love oil and raw garlic, then go for it! The staff is really nice. The \"supreme\" style pizza is better than the pepperoni!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is awesome and the staff just as great. Was so impressed with the customer service, especially fromKris H. She was extremely friendly! I ordered two slices and there was definitely no skimping on toppings, they loaded them up!"}
{"text":"I had a slice of lasagna and a slice of gourmet pepperoni. Both were really good and fresh. The employees are really friendly,  but seemed like they were a bit confused. I think some of them were new. I would definitely come back and try more pizza!"}
{"text":"Eaten here more than once (just forgot to check in because too busy stuffing my face). The best pizza for value and taste is here! I will update after eating with pictures and updates! Alright let's talk my type of pizza: crust needs to be perfect, not too doughy and not too dried out and crunchy. The ratio of cheese to tomato sauce to crust also needs to be considered. It can't be watery, too cheesy, or too dry. I'm sure a 3way ANOVA can show some significance...(lol). The dough must have a neutral yet pleasant taste. I think it depends on the water. The tomato sauce should be savory, not sweet with too much sugar. This place meets my standards for my type of pizza.  Other than the delicious food, the service is fast and friendly, and the atmosphere is hilarious! There are pictures of funny 1950's billboards and posters with clever puns and cute pin up girls with funny sayings. Plus the tables are wiped down and the floor is free of grease tracks and spilled pepper flakes.  I'm coming back again and if you'd like to check it out, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Staying with my guy on a Sunday night in Vegas and we were starving.  We didn't want to move and found that Joe's DELIVERS!!!  SCORE!!     We ordered the veggie pizza and the greek salad.  They delivered our food and realized they gave us a manhattan pizza (all meat).  This is fine and dandy, but i don't eat meat.  So we called them, and they pleasantly delivered my veggie pizza free of charge.    (a) they deliver (b) they are accomodating (c) they deliver  I'm down for them!!"}
{"text":"I was drunk when I ate here. It did save me from a getting a hangover. The sicilian was garbage. The regular was the same. $10 for 3 slices. Bogus slices. It was just like Sbarro's. The pizza was floppy as hell.  I guess you can't really complain when you are drunk. In hindsight, this place was a poor imitation. I would prefer the hillbilly trash pizza I eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Solid. Extremely solid. Several times on this trip I ended up at Joe's because I wanted a cheap meal that I wouldn't immediately regret. . I went with the basic cheese slices, as those seemed to be the freshest and the ones that moved in the most quantity. The crust was thin but not too crisp, the cheese was real and the sauce was surprisingly above average. They claim the sauce is made every day in house and I think that statement would pass a lie detector test on Maury. They had very interesting specialty pies and subs, I didn't get to try those but other tables looked happy. It's right across the street from the Hard Rock. They say they are the best in town, not so sure about that, but they are certainly on the list."}
{"text":"As a born and raised New Yorker myself this is probably the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. Not exactly New York good, but close and definitely best in Phoenix (so far). Great price, speedy preparation, overall good food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Vegas!! Amazing food and the most welcoming friendly staff. They always make you feel at home and go above and beyond to make sure you get the best service. Love a place that exceeds my expectations and i think it should be recognized!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Vegas right across the way from the Hard Rock, the price is right, and the food is on point, I suggest the greek salad to all you salad love rs with the feta dressing, pasta rocks, pizza bomb."}
{"text":"Pizza options aren't the greatest in Vegas, but Joe's is okay. Delivery dude was cool, but pizza was 15-20m late (we were down the road like 0.25mi) and luke-warm by the time we got it. Also, it taste like they use provolone cheese, which some people don't mind, but I really prefer mozzarella pizza. Also $24 for a a couple topping large provolone-based pizza seems high? How is this \"$\" and not \"$$\"?"}
{"text":"My wife and I liked this place. We needed a quick bite to eat before we went to the outlet mall to do some shopping and this place was just what the doctor ordered. We ordered a couple slices and we loved it. Quick service good pizza."}
{"text":"First of all, the place is so cute lol but the food was so yummy. The wings are better than actual wing restaurants and the portion sizes are huge! Super awesome. My fav spot now! And the employees are super amazing too. They were super patient and happy! Especially Valerie! She helped me find my favorite food to order!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas and was craving a great pizza. I found on Yelp and I was truly impressed with the prompt delivery and the driver was very sweet and professional. I loved that it was not greasy. I loved that I can have my order delivered to my hotel. I will recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here last night to split a slice after yoga (that makes sense, right?). There is nothing terribly special about this place, just a counter with pizzas where you can pick out a slice, despite this, it was tasty! The crust was thin and crispy, the cheese was melty and gooey, overall it was just a solid slice of New York style pizza. I won't be rushing over here to get a slice, but if I were in the neighborhood, I would stop in again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Went to four different types of pizzerias in the last two days. It's crispy, sauce is tasty, dough is crunchy and not bland.  The cashier guys are awesome  Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong the pizza is ok but damn if your doing a 2 pizza slice lunch specail only cheese and pepperoni but only have one of each,  its fucking 11.30 and you already running out like fucking come some peoole have timed lunches i dont have tine for yiu to nake other pep or cheese pizza cuz someone to dumb enough to know if your gunna have a lunch specail for those two only to habe more then one of each like commen sense then you have all these other pizzas up on the shit and aint no one ordering it... damn who be running these businesses"}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's about 50 times in 2008. It's better than most but so terribly inconsistent, even the slices. Which, by the way, they often kept out for too long, and is fucking gross.   As far as pizza slices, NYPD is better, and the Pizza by Napoli place on the NW side has got them both beat. Some of these reviews are from people who went there piss drunk and wouldn't know the difference between pizza or cardboard. The good pizza I had here, well it was great, so I'd give it 3 stars. But I wouldn't wait in line for more than 10 minutes here, even if I was starving."}
{"text":"It was ok. The pizza was good and \"foldable\"\". Garlic knots were dry with no garlic - really disappointed in those. Unfortunately I have nothing fantastic, witty or biting to report. Very middle of the road."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. We eat pizza a lot and love to try new pizza places. Ordered our small pizza which seemed overly prices but figured it would probably taste so good it would be worth it. Wrong! The pizza wasn't awful but it was just ok. Not much flavor. It is vey filling because the crust is very thick so it will fill you up but not very satisfying for the taste buds. Not worth the money so on to the next."}
{"text":"Located in an unassuming shopping center off of the Strip, Joe's has a great variety of pizza options.  They deliver late and have 24 hour delivery on weekends.  But me?  I went for lunch.  Two slices of great cheese pizza and a side of well seasoned french fries (served with marinara sauce, no less) and a drink made me feel just like I was somewhere on the East Coast.  The friendly staff made it a perfect option for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Best damn pizza on the planet and I had pizza in new York. And Chicago if you find a better pizza spot then this let me know"}
{"text":"Customer service means a lot and Joes does not have it. Found Joes by accident and it looked inviting from the outside. They make their money off serving the after clubbing drunk crowd who just want the closest food. Someone needs to tell the counter employees to treat people who come in there on a Wednesday afternoon with appreciation & respect.   A strange non-feature is that there's no iced tea. No sweet, unsweet brewed, or fountain tea. Also not a large selection of fountain drinks and one of the flavors was not working.   The veggie sandwich was really good (see pic.) Thats the only positive thing I can say about Joes.   Got an order of cheese fries and they were disgusting! The fries were soggy with no seasoning. Don't know what kind of cheese was melted on them but it wasn't good either (see pic)  The only reason I didn't try the pizza was that it had flies all over all the pizzas and the employees clearly didn't care. Since they leave the doors open the small, crowded restaurant has many flies all over you food.   Even after the next time I leave the club in search of munchies one night I will NOT be going to Joes."}
{"text":"This Pizza is BOMB! Pizza by the slice it's just delicious and somewhat crispy oh it was perfection. The taste is also perfect. Writing about it makes me want a slice right now. Personnel was nice the only downside was that there was no regular iced tea because it had not been prepared for that day. (Not sure why) but the coca cola machine with millions of flavors took care of me with the Dasani mineral water with a hint of Lime."}
{"text":"I feel like I should WUI (write under the influence) since that's when I usually eat at Joe's, but I'll spare you all the hassle of having to decipher my drunken stupor.   Joe's is my go-to-place while out in Old Town. My routine is to leave the club around 1am, but not w/o getting a stamp for re-entry, stop in for a slice before a line forms, then return to the club for last call.  They have serveral types of pizza available for re-heating. I like the basil and tomato with no sauce. It has just the right amount of cheese and the crust is slightly crispy yet chewy.   I should try it sober one day. Hopefully I'll enjoy it just as much!"}
{"text":"OMG. Hands down the BEST New York style pizza in the valley! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to get a slice from time to time. It tastes even more amazing after a night at the Maya. Wow, just wow. My mouth is salivating as I am writing this review!!!!! The sauce is garlicky (which I LOVE!) and it folds perfectly in your mouth. A little on the greasy side (your stomach may be mad at you later), but I don't care. Tastes so good going down it's worth it. Thanks Joe's for fulfilling my NY pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a cheap and huge slice of pizza after a night of drinking. Other wise this place is a complete mess due to all the drunks that come in after the bars close."}
{"text":"Pizza was very delicious. Good crust and lots of topping. But I order delivery and it took about an hour to get my order. I would buy again but pick up would be better choice"}
{"text":"Really nice location, close to Hard Rock Hotel and strip area. they have outdoor seating, which we Las Vegas customers Love! I had been here years ago and had their famous pizza! Love the pizza, but came in because I heard they had great chicken wings. And, yes the wings are really good. I did find that the fresh cut fries were a bit salty, but still very tasty. The customer service was 5 Star and they were very efficient and courteous.  Make sure to tip even if you just order take out, Im sure they appreciate it.  Of Course I will be back!  Highly Recommend.."}
{"text":"Just because a piece of pizza is foldable doesn't make it New York style. It's all in the crust, and Joe's doesn't have the right chew or texture. That said, it's also absolutely delicious.  I went with the \"Grandee Pepperoni\" which includes a ridiculously flavorful combination of pepperoni, gorgonzola cheese (no mozz), red pepper and fried pepperoni chips. The fried pepperoni makes the dish with it's deep salty flavor. The gorgonzola's brightness is perfectly balanced with the oily meat. This rich and savory pie is highly recommended.   I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery but in reality, it took almost two hours. Oh well, what can you expect for a Friday night in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Nice place. Small spot but effecient pizza shop. Pizza came out hot and not patchy like some places. The crust was on point. Flexible but still had a crunch. Will grab a slice here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! The garlic breadsticks were cheesy goodness as well. Super quick delivery and very friendly!"}
{"text":"The meaty pizza was great. I used uber eats and got it delivered directly to my hotel! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Order a pizza fresh out of the oven and you won't be disappointed. Lots of menu options for any palette, salad and pasta too. Best pizza crust we have ever had, our five sons agreed! We will be back next time we are in town for sure."}
{"text":"Just across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.  Open 24 hours.  Loved the Hungarian Pizza - comes with chicken, sour cream, onions (must try if you love sour cream!).  However, this large slice cost me $4.60.  If you're drunk and hungry, cost doesn't matter! Feed your drunk taste buds!"}
{"text":"I am not the nostalgic type.  I am all about new technology and new fangled things.  But, not with Joe's.  When I moved here to Las Vegas in 2007, this was a place I stumbled upon.  There was absolutely no pretense....a bunch of cool New Yawker guys just putting some pie together.  Some good sports on tv.  And, if you went at lunch, all the working class rolled in.  That is a good sign.  The last few years the guys were gone, the pizza did seem to have the same zip and then on my last visit (this checkin) it became obvious someone's mom took over the place.  Faux tablecloths, and tried to make it look all pretty.  Totally stripped the vibe of a local, authentic pie house.  Pizza was ok.  But, mostly it seems like a nice place for a tourist to pop in, not the local NV Energy line work or Metro cop."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's not on the strip, located in a shopping center across the street from The Hard Rock Hotel. (The shopping center itself is interesting, with a very lively CVS, a few cute restaurants, and a 24 hour pedicure \"spa\"...). Parking is easy, and the place itself is cute and clean, with a few tables to sit.   I've only ordered their pizza, and have always been satisfied. It's down to earth, good food. Their slices are thick, and quite good. Nice crust, good cheese, not too greasy. It's good pizza at a decent prize.    Overall, I like that it's a departure from plastic overpriced pizza you sometimes find on the strip.  If you're staying at the Hard Rock or close by, it's worth a trip. I didn't know they deliver to hotels, will definitely keep it in mind next time."}
{"text":"My fav pizza place in town. Jalapeño/Pepperoni way to go  Best pizza in town  If you havent gone to Joe's and left the town. You missed the delicious pizza which this town offers."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite pizza place by far and the customer service is excellent!! I've been going here for over four years and it never disappoint"}
{"text":"That was a complete waste of money.. The cheese steak was cut up roast beef lunch meat.. I ate one bite and wanted to vomit.. The fries were coated in oil with no flavor.. My boyfriend got an eggplant sandwich and ate 4 bites and threw it away.. Dont waste you money and dont wonder if you will be sick."}
{"text":"BEST place for pizza!  Came here after a whole day at REHAB on a Sunday and after walking around like seemed like forever inside the hard rock hotel- finally found a guy to locate us in the direction of food, specifically pizza, which I was craving. (All of hard rocks food closed at around 6 & what was open seemed to cost am arm and a leg for something half that price back home!)  Boy was I glad we left the hotel, and although quite drunk, we managed to hop tipsily on over to this little strip mall next to a sports bar and a sushi place and boy was I surprised!! Best pizza ever!! DELICIOUS!  I walked right in- spent about $5 for a slice of pizza that would put costcos to shame and my taste buds were doing a dance of glory! The tomato basil was to die for!- thin crust, freshly tasting basil with yummy marinara and the perfect blend combined.   It was SO good we told out friends who we came back with like an hour later and every single person who walked in seemed to either be a local and know the spot or were told the same thing by someone else and were thoroughly impressed. I even had their fettuccini Alfredo the second time and it was almost better than Olive Garden!!  This place seems to be a place in New York or the Bronx (not that I've ever been) but this is a little hole in the wall- Italian pizzeria and whoever joe is- let me tell you!! You got some great food!!  I WILL be back! Ciao!"}
{"text":"So, lemme start off with I was hoping for a lot better based on the more recent reviews.   Now, I ordered a greek salad and asked to not have peppers or tomatoes. Both were on there... in fact there was extra peppers :(. I also ordered chicken on it, but it was on the side. It smelled a bit off and was so dry and crunchy like it had been under a heating lamp for a while. I also ordered a buffalo chicken sub with chicken tenders for my boyfriend. That had to be the most upsetting of the order. The lettuce (salad, lets be honest) was brown and even looked burnt in some areas. It was soggy and very unsavory looking. At least the chips were good right? I had to take out and toss all the peppers, tomatoes, the entire sub, the side chicken and the zippoles were so weak and there's no way there was cinnamon on it.   Really disappointed. First trip to Las Vegas. Will not be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the gluten free pizza. We had it delivered and they were on time.  They do a really good job of this.   I only said O.K. for this review as I also order a mixed green salad. It said it had field greens.  Their other selections mention iceberg and anyone that appreciates good salads know that iceberg is cheap and worthless.   My salad was delivered with iceberg.  So I hope in any future order they get this right ."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery today. It was 20 min early and delicious and hot! I only got mozzarella sticks and a meatball sub but there were big meatballs, plenty of sauce and cheese. Fantastic! I've had the pizza here before as well and its thin and extremely tasty. It truly is like NY street pizza. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is the best slice in Las Vegas period. The whole staff are rock stars. Especially Chris H. She is a customer service genius period dot."}
{"text":"I am still baffled that NO ONE has wrote back or apologized for the disgusting experience we had at your location a few weeks ago. This just further proves how unprofessional this \"business\" establishment is and how they would careless about their repeat customers. I was quite embarrassed i recommended you to my family who was visiting from out of town, now im just disgusted knowing that you refuse to make this wrong a right."}
{"text":"I found myself singing the tune of \"That don't impress me much\" in my mind during my food session.  I tried the lasagna pizza at their suggestion as this was my first time and they had quite a few ready made pizzas available by the slice.  The toppings were great, the concept of lasagna style topped pizza is a great concept! However where they fail miserably is the crust. The pizza crust is thin, limp, flavorless and soggy which does not support the toppings.   I don't want anything that is limp in my mouth, especially when it comes to pizza! The crust was just bad, bad and more bad. No happy ending here :(  Hit it and quit it, I am done!"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks! Will not return, stood at the register waiting to order my food without being acknowledged for several minutes."}
{"text":"Just ate a little piece of heaven!!! Best piece of pizza I think I've ever eaten! They sell it by the slice and it is a huge slice. There were so many different kinds, it was hard to decide on one. I ended up going with one that had spinach and tomatoes (don't know what it was called), and I savored every last bite! Going back for lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"Daytime visit - slices were fairly good.  Good cheese, base crust ok, though the crust at the end was nice and airy with good chewy inside and good crunch outside.  Two cheese slices and a drink was a little high for $8 but it's not a cheap area.  Seating was extremely limited, mostly community seating in fact, and tables not cleaned.   Parking was somewhat challenging on the street.  Would only go here again if it was an off hour, perhaps right at open or after lunch rush."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!! Not over exaggerating either. I had called to place an order for delivery. First I was told that it would take 45 mins-1 hour, however, then I was told it would take an 1 hour 20 minutes. Although, I thought this was a long time, I still decided to order. I called the establishment an 1 and a 30 minutes after I placed the order because I still had not heard from them and no pizza in sight. They told me 3 different stories, hung up on the phone on me, passed the phone around. First told me the ticket was in the window and it was coming, then told me the ticket was missing, then told me the ticket fell on the ground! It took me over 2 HOURS TO GET MY PIZZA. 2 HOURS!! Then I called to talk to a manager, they told me there was no manager on site. I called back the next day to talk with a manager and the manager told me that there is ALWAYS a manager and asked me why I did not talk with manager that night. THen she told me she would call me back and NEVER did. BOTTOM LINE, the food is decent, but seriously if you want a headache and HORRIBLE SERVICE then eat decent food. There are better and far better customer service pizza places out there! THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST, WORST, WORST SERVICE EVER!!! I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS BUT I CANT!! THIS PLACE SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! $6 for 3 slices! In and out within 5-10 minutes.   I've gotten about every type of pizza they offer at this point and I've always been satisfied. Pizza is large, thin, foldable and durable just like you'd expect from a NY pizza. Never overly greasy. Vegetables always have a crunch. Not to much in terms of premium or unconventional ingredients. Full pies are a little pricey but hey it's good pizza!"}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious. Just go. And enjoy! Enormous calzones, really great pizza, thin flavorful crust, tasty sauce. Spaghetti marinara so good, great Greek salad, I could go on and on. So good!"}
{"text":"While traveling for business, I ordered delivery, twice in one week from this place. The people I entertained loved it. Reminded one of being back east. I thought for the overall quality of the pizza, it was a bit pricey, but the taste/texture was good and the service, even better."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and it wasn't that bad. Pizza was nice and fresh and tasted good. I do however feel like they're a little pricey. I got the lunch deal that ends @2 pm (not sure what time it starts) but it was 2 slices of pepperoni pizza with a drink for $9.00 plus tax  if u wanted cheese pizza it's a dollar less so 8.00 plus tax and any \"specialty pizza\" is 10.00 plus tax. They all include drinks. Without the lunch special , prices were a little higher. The pizza slices were decent just a little too thin. I feel like you could have got a whole pizza box elsewhere for that price. Other than that, everything was good. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!!  They were nice when I picked my order up...that's it.  The veggie pizza was soggy as hell...must have used frozen vegetables!  The Caesar's Salad had like a mayonnaise-type dressing...I kid you not, not even CLOSE to what it should taste like.  The dessert, homemade zeppoles, tasted like straight oil.  I mean...how can you F up fried dough?!  This I paid $31 and change...after tip it was $36.00.  Needless to say...I shan't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, clean location and really good mozzarella sticks! Definitely hit this place up if your looking for good pizza, wings or anything italian!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive. A single slice of pizza is $5.35. It's ok pizza I guess but its not worth more than $3 per slice."}
{"text":"The Best in Phoenix by FAR.  Get the house chopped salad as well."}
{"text":"Everything about this place exceeded our expectations. Great food, very clean, loved the decor and music and fed our family of 5 (two teens included) for $40.  A nice change from the meals we've had on the strip."}
{"text":"Finally a good NY pizza place in Vegas! We love the pizza here! Please open one in Henderson!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE these people. I'm from NYC on a business trip, and in NYC ordering take out is an art form. I've had some difficulty finding restaurants to deliver to my hotel room during my stay in Vegas. But not Joe's! I've ordered from them two nights in a row (with probably a few more to come) and each time it's been no muss no fuss and the food is GREAT."}
{"text":"This pizza was surprisingly FREAKING DELICIOUS! The 4 of us sitting back at the house relaxing trying to decide what munchies to order and we decided to try out Joe's.   We ordered the pepperoni with gorgonzola cheese specialty pizza as well as the Frat boy pizza. They delivered it via grub hub in less then an hour, still piping hot. The 2 small pizza between 4 hungry did the trick. We still have 3 slices left over.   Very nicely and evenly baked, the toppings were very fresh and delicious. Crust was perfect, not too crispy, but definitely had a crunch. I had my favorite ranch dressing I get from trader Joe's on hand, so I was good there. We ordered the little donut balls as well, good, but the pizza was the star of the show.  Over all, A+ pizza, A++ on the delivery time, very satisfied pizza lovers over here. :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here on several occasions, but the quality and service has gotten really bad.  Well... today would be the very last time since it has not improved.  I placed my usual order of Greek Salad and had them add Grilled Chicken, Artichokes and Mozzerella.  I received the order quickly but as usual it was missing something. It happens every time though but I figured I's give them the benefit of the doubt and try again.  This time it was missing the Feta cheese which is standard on a Greek salad always. It even says this in the description on their menu of course.  Here is the actual listing from their menu: Greek Salad  Greek Salad is served with Croutons, Cucumber, Feta Cheese, Field Greens, Green Peppers, Kalamata Olives, Pepperoncini, Red Onions, Tomatoes.   Oh I forgot to mention that I added Artichokes and received 3 pieces, reallyyyyyy? They did give a generous amount of chicken and the mozzerella was also good, but come on with the Artichokes. (just a taste) Oh and while I was eating the salad I noticed several rotten leaves of lettuce in the field greens in my salad, That also was a big stomach turner. So I am done!  So, I called back as I always do and explained that it was missing the Feta cheese only. The guy that I told this too puts me on hold and someone else gets on the phone and asks me what I would like? He said would you like me to bring you a lot of Feta Cheese or make you another salad. So he said I'm busy right now so what would you like and proceeds to rush me. They screwed up my order but now I have to pay the price? How does that work?  Anyway, after screwing it up last time I remember the girl telling me that this time would be free. Of course they forgot that part and I was charged again."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"Italian calzone\" (ham and pepperoni). Got it late, burnt and without pepperoni. Awful, not much more to say about it."}
{"text":"Joes is next to the Hard Rock. While I am not a huge pizza fan nor a pizza connoisseur,  I was pleased with the taste of Joes. I had plain cheese pizza and my friend had sausage and mushrooms. Notable that even a plain cheese slice had very satisfying flavors in comparison to the pizza with toppings. Either way is a big fat win in the taste department.   The nice decor with old coke ads and vintage art with red and white, make for the Italian feel.  I just may become  pizza enthusiast!"}
{"text":"I tried Joe's during a  work lunch for the first time last week. We ordered many different varieties but i ended up trying the cheese and meat lovers. The pizzas had a great flavor and texture. The pizza slices were enormous.   The pizza was perfectly thin and still had a great texture and the sauce was tangy and delicious. Everyone in our office was a fan and they packaged and traveled perfectly. The salads were tasty too. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"There is no reason why it takes close to 2 hours to get 1 pizza made and delivered. We called after an hour and was told it had already left and is in route. For the price we paid for a pizza and how long we wait, it's clear customer service was not a priority. Very disappointing as we ARE Still waiting..."}
{"text":"We ordered our food really late, maybe just after midnight, and they delivered our food within 45 minutes. And on top of that it was hot when we got it and f-ing DELICIOUS! The pizza, wings, and garlic knots that we ordered were amazing. Definitely will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Arrived very late to Las Vegas and was hungry so my girlfriend and i Decided to give this place a try and was shocked on how good the pizza was. They are open late. Said it would take an hour and a half for delivery but it only took 45 minutes."}
