{"text":"Fantastic food, good prices, great portions. Went there on a whim when visiting downtown Phoenix. Sauces for all the meats are great. Green beans, collards, and corn breads were our favorite sides!
The guys running the joint went out of their way to be helpful."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are from California, and we were staying in a hotel near by, so we decided to walk over and try this place. Very friendly service. They greeted us as soon as we walked in, with great smiles and matching personality. Not only do they have a ton of bbq, they also had a lot of sea food. Ordered a catfish sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese. Was not disappointed! Went back the very next day for dinner and got a pulled pork sandwich, macaroni and cheese, and jalapeno poppers. Everything was delicious! One of the best mac and cheese I had in a while. And to top it off the price wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"They are very kind and respectful I will make my way support small business are best so plz go support"}
{"text":"We rode the lightrail on Valentine's Day and passed this place.  I looked it up and read all the good reviews and was immediately intrigued.  Today we came to have lunch.  The place was packed which gave us a little extra time to figure out exactly what we wanted. A full pound of pulled pork and catfish nuggets along with fries, green beans and corn!  It was delicious!  My boyfriend picked the green beans as a side and I wasn't expecting anything special but I was wrong.  They were seasoned delightfully.  All the staff were extremely friendly.  The only disappointment was when the food was all gone!  We consoled ourselves by resolving to come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff but sad to say I did not like the food. Way too much mustard in everything. Needless to say I am not a mustard  fan. 

The meat was very soft but once again the mustard in the barbecue sauce was too much for me. 

The coleslaw was yellow, way too much mustard. So if you like mustard give it a shot. 

May I recommend the owners to visit Little Miss BBQ."}
{"text":"Load up. Some good smoked meat here. I stopped by on my way to the airport- it's only 5m away. I got the two meat platter and portions are large, meat is nicely smoked, great crust on the ribs and brisket. Fries were good- some nice seasoning added. The meat comes nicely sauced. I didn't look to see if there are other sauce options but the house sauce is good- not too spicy, not too sweet. Beans were decently good- they make their own. Location is not in the best part of town but wasn't a big deal- not much surrounding it. There is a light rail stop nearby. Recommend."}
{"text":"High level BBQ. You can smell the smoke and meat in the air as they heat it up for you. I recommend trying a little bit of everything. I've been twice now and it just keeps getting better. Cool guys running the show of the best BBQ place I've been to yet in the area."}
{"text":"This location used to be known as Mandy's. I drove to this location looking for Mandy's to get some good catfish and come to  find that they had sold the location. Now devastated, me and my family litterally drove around the building and almost left until I was urged by my fiance to give them a try. To be honest I didnt think they could live up to Mandys but to my suprise they were not only exellent in serive but the food was amazing. We ordered the catfish plate with fries and potatoe salad (sweet but tangy) but also had a fish basket (1pc catfish n several fried shrimp) and burger for the kids.  I have to say they lived up to my expectation   
and I would recommend everybody give them a try. The oweners are Michael and Jason hence MJ who are very friendly and kind. They have been open for only 7 weeks and after spending some time I would say we will definitely be back. Especially for soul food Sundays!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was craving some BBQ for 4th of July, and the best in town (Little Miss BBQ) was closed. Found this place on yelp so thought I would give it a try instead of hitting one of the chain joints. Was definitely NOT impressed overall. The mac and cheese was good. Creamy with a nice stringy cheese topping. The sliced brisket was very tender-no knife needed. But there was no discernible smoke to it. In my book, bbq is about smoked meat, not about the bbq sauce. This brisket tasted like it was cooked in an oven, instead of over an open  flame. The hot link did have a nice \"snap\" to its casing, but the sausage itself was pretty ordinary. 

I believe that great bbq can be served naked, with the sauce on the side, since the meat is the main main focus, and the sauce is secondary. But here they serve the meat covered with the bbq sauce. And the sauce itself was nothing to write home about. Bottom line, I have had worse bbq, but there are many places that do a better job.. and the great customer service everyone else raved about was not here today. I was the only customer in the place yet no friendly vibe present from the staff/owners."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here and I must say the customer service is amazing, the owners make you feel right at home and the food is absolutely delicious! I had the fried chicken half wings and I can't even put into words how good it was. Definitely recommend everyone to try it out!"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and just searched the area for something to eat and I'm glad I came upon MJ's. The owners were there and super friendly. Brisket was super delicious as was the mac and cheese and baked beans. Definitely will be a spot when I come into town."}
{"text":"I was VERY PLEASED with the greeting AND my order!!! Loved the greeting Michael gave me as soon as I walked in! Customer service is very important to me, and for that I give him and Jason an A+. I ordered the pulled pork & beef brisket w/collared greens & baked beans. Loved the spice kick on the greens. Beans were pretty good, too. Meat was very tender & full of sauce to soak up with bread,  JUST how I like it!! To your success MJ's!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food. Prices are great for what you get. Their cornbread is amazing."}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ! Loved the beef brisket and baked beans, the meat was perfectly tender! We had this meal catered in for lunch and we all were so happy with the food!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for a while, after seeing it on Yelp.  We drove from Ahwatukee just to give this place a try.  We tried the fried okra, bbq chicken wings, fried catfish, bbq brisket,  sausage, mac & cheese, and greens. Let me say that the food was awesome. That's a lot coming from me because I'm a southern girl from Louisiana. So their slogan is true to it's words they really do \" Put the South in your mouth.\"  The customer service was excellent as well which means a lot in this day and age. We'll definitely be back. Please give this place a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We happened to park near this restaurant one night and stopped in for late evening snack. Great catfish, French fries, hush puppies and mac and cheese! Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop right out of the airport! The owners are incredible people, they just opened this restaurant and cook a mean burger. The chef will customize your burgers any what you want."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I had the lemon pepper wings and they were outstanding. Husband had the brisket and said it was some of the best he'd ever had. The owner was very gracious and accommodating. Love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my new faves. Glad that we found MJ's. the customer service is always good, and the food is good as well."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A Phoenix BBQ restaurant where you will get your money's worth in terms of both food quality and quantity. 

We ordered the beef brisket and pulled pork plate. We were assured that this plate would be more than enough for two and it certainly was. The meats were done to perfection. Also, there was just the right amount of sauce on each meat; to much or too little sauce will take exquisitely  smoked meats like these, into the dry zone or the soup zone. In Phoenix, it is all to easy to find either the super dry or the swimming-in-sauce varieties of BBQ. 

The BBQ bar has just been raised in the PHX!! 

Also, the folks working there made my spouse and I feel very welcomed; being a same-sex couple, this kind of warmth was truly appreciated more than they will ever realize!! :)"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ from an Awesome person. I got the 1/2 lb of brisket coupled with mac and cheese. The brisket was perfect with the right amount of fat. It comes with BBQ sauce FYI. The meat had a good smokey feel and I would definitely get it again. The mac was also really good and tastes like a thanksgiving style mac versus some generic mac you'd get at a chance. I'm coming back. It should be noted the service was top notch and you can tell the owner cares about costumers and their experience. 

 One side note- due to construction you have to use the business access way to get here. It makes the trip two minutes longer but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Went back today for some BBQ. Had the brisket sandwich. It was tender and smoky with a generous portion of brisket and the right amount of barbeque sauce. And for an added bonus the smell of the smoker in the restaurant was slight but heavenly. 

Thank you MJ's for great food and being so close to work.

on a side note:
I love it when a restaurant that sells BBQ food actually smells like BBQ. I have been in a few restaurants around town that don't smell like smoke inside or out that claim to be BBQ restaurants."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich I really good and I normally hate slaws but they got the best slaw I've ever had took the wife and we had a good time can't wait to come back to try another BBQ food here"}
{"text":"Don't miss these guys if you want the real deal. BBQ, no doubt. Catfish, a must try. 
Cashier advised me to try brisket and fish combo. I trusted him and was not disappointed. I also tried the rib tips. Very good smoke job on the meat and the fish flakey and moist. The owner mgr cares about your satisfaction and they aim to please. Will return when in PHX."}
{"text":"The owner was working when we went in and was so friendly, and patient too (it was hard to decide what to order!). Did zucchini to start - breading was tasty and crispy. Add Tabasco, you won't be disappointed. Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, hot links all to die for!! Sides were yummy also, tried baked beans, potato salad and Mac and cheese, but the main courses are the real stars at MJ's. I couldn't even pause for a pic everything was so good! This place is fabulous, I would recommend it to anyone who loves BBQ."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!! Both owners made it a point to have a conversation with me as well as thank me for coming into their establishment! I ordered the catfish nuggets with a side of mac && cheese, it was delicious! You can tell they really put passion into the food they make! I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"This is a brand new BBQ joint. I very much enjoyed the food. I had jalapeño poppers for an appetizer, then pulled pork and beef brisket entree with cole slaw and beans for the sides. The slaw and beans were excellent. The meats both melted in my mouth. I spoke the owners Jason and Michael, also. A couple of really friendly and good guys from Flint, Michigan.
I was just in town overnight for business and will definitely make this place a regular stop on my subsequent visits to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but worth it. Pay attention to you map application or you will miss it! 
Very friendly family run BBQ with delicious food. BIG PORTIONS.
Had pulled pork and brisket which were delicious. Just the right amount of tanginess. The \"family recipe\" mac n cheese was the the perfect compliment to the BBQ. 
Make the trip and support this new BBQ place. Love it."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way to the airport, food is great and service is better. Pulled pork was moist and smokey, sauce was on point..."}
{"text":"Man!!! The Burgers here are seasoned to perfection. My God, the fries?!? (Homer Simpson drool.... LOL!!!) The staff here are very friendly and professional. Would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is the first BBQ place, that had everything I wanted. Huge Spicy wings, fall off the bone ribs, mac&cheese, patatoe salad, fried zucchini, and yes we ordered everything I just mentioned. Im coming back for the fish and shrimp very soon. Im from Boston, Lived in New York, Texas, now AZ, I believe I have a good palate for real bbq, and this place satisfied it. Im not joking try this place out!"}
{"text":"If you like good Southern cooking this is the place. Great hospitality. Fried catfish done right. Ribs are tasty but I like mine a little more pull than just fall off the bone. Brisket is like butter. Loved the. Asked beans and coleslaw. Best hush puppies. Location is a bit of a pain but use the little. Businesses side road."}
{"text":"THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE BEST DAMN FOOD I'VE HAD OUT HERE! Now I'm from the heart of Texas! PROUD SOUTHERNER through and through! So, I am definitely biased when anyone says they're bringing that down home, good ol' fashioned southern style cooking!  Papa Jo's, I'm sorry to say, but y'all ain't got NOTHING on MJ's!  I brought the same biased attitude to MJ's that I did to Papa Jo's and Lolo's, but MJ'S BBQ took it on HOME!  Everything was fantastic! Mac n Cheese...catfish...hot links..greens...fried brownies wooooo! Good lawd!  They make that kinda food that makes you not want to go to any fast food restaurants.  You know how back in the day, when your Momma threw down in the kitchen for dinner, but your friends wanted to eat out and you were like, \"Naaaaah, I'm good. You already know my Momma cooked.\"  Then all of a sudden, you find your friends sitting there begging to come with you??  Yeah.  MJ'S BBQ IS YO MOMMA'S AND GRANDMAMA'S COOKING!!  You better read this review and BELIEVE IT! Take yo butt on over to MJ's BBQ and quit playing. I dare anybody afterwards to tell me I'm wrong!"}
{"text":"Hello, we were just cruising around on a rainy Saturday at Phoenix flea market, which was very mediocre btw, and we yelped a nearby restaurant and came up with MJ's BBQ.  We walked in right behind a really nice group of folks that were all together so there was a bit of a wait but the staff were super pleasant and spot on accurate and kept it fun while working through everyone's order.  We got chicken, porker ribs, brisket, and pulled pork, and every thing was excellent. Great fries n slaw as well.  Really nice surprise, we'll come back again.  Gina says it was yummy n friendly"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and was very pleasantly surprised. Super nice people, make you feel like you're dining at their house. We opted for the whole wings, we got 6 split between two people with a side of fries and baked beans. Asked the cashier what flavor to get and he recommended \"by far\" the honey gold. I'm so happy we took his recommendation cause those were some of the best damn chicken wings I've ever had. Fries were seasoned perfectly, and the baked beans were on point. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Just ate at MJ's. Best barbecue in town. Now we don't have to drive all the way to Gilbert to get good barbecue. Such friendly staff and the owner is super nice. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has really friendly service and great food! Had the chicken tenders and they were delicious. Right by the light rail too which is convenient."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the first time.  Michael and Jason were very friendly and provided great service.  We had a four meat platter.  All of the food was excellent.  Our sides of collard greens and Cole slaw we very good.  The price is reasonable.  We strongly recommend everyone try this food.  We are sure you will be as satisfied as we were.  We now have a place to satisfy our BBQ cravings.  The peach cobbler with ice cream was great too.  You all must try this place."}
{"text":"Had two meat plate, brisket, catfish and double order on mac.  All the food was good and made fresh to order! Downside was tea didn't taste fresh.     I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with family, headed to a concert at Celebrity Theater. We stopped in here to have dinner and it was pretty good. It's far from me and I wouldn't make the trip just to eat here, but if I was in the area, I'd definitely come back.

It's a bit pricey. Two two-meat platters (comes with two sides), one pulled pork meal (one side), 3 drinks and tip was $56~

Ribs and brisket were decent, not the best, but better than most. I make ribs at home, so I'm super picky about these.

My wife and my dad both said the pulled pork was excellent. I thought their BBQ sauce was original and very tasty. I assume they're making it in house and that it's not a commercial restaurant product.

Mac and cheese was ok, with a good flavor but the texture was off. It was quite mushy. My wife loves green beans and she said they were really good. I had collard greens and these were cooked perfectly. I'm used to them being cooked with smoked meat for flavor. These were not, but were still tender and nicely seasoned.

Portions are the right size.

I think we stopped in like 30 minutes to closing, so that could explain the Mac and Cheese.

Really nice people running the place, were welcoming and courteous."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time yesterday. Awesome greeting by the owner, Michael, made me feel right at home. The Brisket sandwich was amazing. Tender meat. Delicious crispy fried onions on top. Going back today to try the chicken."}
{"text":"I was so excited for soul food!!! Great customer service! Clean establishment.  Great music. The meats were great quality and cooked well. 

The Bbq sauce was not very good, it tasted like ketchup. The collard greens were not very good, its hard to explain, but not good. Mac n Cheese didn't have much flavor.  The potato salad was also a bit bland and taste store bought. 

I've heard so many good things about this place and maybe we caught them in a bad day,  but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Just came off the plane and came straight here. EXCELLENT food, friendly people. Pay attention to directions, on access rode. Worth the effort to get here."}
{"text":"The best souls food run by probably the nicest guys I've ever met. Had the catfish sandwich, Mac and cheese and coleslaw. All were crazy good. The catfish was thin and fried crispy and the coleslaw was very flavorful on the side. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and tasty. Will definitely be bringing the whole crew here soon. Good foods with good vibes."}
{"text":"This is the stop for bbq. Smells like a dream come true. These guys are super friendly. I tell people often about m.j.s does not disappoint. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We walked in the door to a very welcoming staff that is clearly proud of the food they serve.  I was there to try the BBQ and my freinds were there for the Catfish.  Both were good, but neither was a standout.  I had Brisket, Pulled Pork and Hot links.  The Hot links were not hot, more like smoked sausage, but good flavor.  There was just enought smoke flavor in both the Brisket and the pork, but the pork was a touch dry.  I had green beans which were good and Greens which were not very flavorful, but still had a little texture so at least not overcooked.  I wanted to try everyting, so took most of it home and it reheated into a couple more meals, which was great.  All in all, I wanted to like it more than I did becasue of the staff and I like to support local business.  I will return and maybe try the fish or the wings."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good at a reasonable price. It is a little difficult to find the place as it is right on the light rail line and obscured from view by the train station, and you have to travel across the tracks to the business access part of the road. And remember that it is a one way street when you exit the parking lot, so turn left as you do. 
It was great to see Southern cooking on the menu. I had the deep fried cod and deep fried zucchini for a side. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Great food!! the chefs are awesome and funny. AND honey gold wings !!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the catfish sandwich & slaw & a large sweet tea. This place is only 6 weeks new. I was able to substitutes the fries for slaw so that was nice. 
Sandwich was good. Wish I remembered to get hot sauce. Would've made it better. Bread was toasted but still soft and fresh, fish fell apart in my mouth & still got crispiness of breading. Slaw is tasty, tangy & fresh. Best part of my visit was the service! Energetic and personable. Even customer at counter made me feel like family there. I can't wait to go back & try the next item on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great customer service
Great food
Prices are a little highly but it's quality meat so it's worth every penny 
This will be a new lunch spot"}
{"text":"Very good! Next time I'm getting the meat nachos. It was a huge plate. Not a long wait but I'd call in a large work order."}
{"text":"Staying in Phoenix for the night before an early flight out tomorrow, so decided to check these guys out.  I'm a Kansas City native, so know something about BBQ.

Most people don't realize that BBQ is only half about the food.  The other half is about the family.  BBQ was born in places where money and resources were tight, but the family was tighter.  When you walk into MJ's, you feel like family and are treated as such.  They might be from Tennessee and Michigan, but I may as well have known them my entire life.  When it comes to that aspect of BBQ, they have it nailed, no question.  Even if they were serving cold cut sandwiches, I'd come back just for the hospitality.

The food was good as well.  I got the two meat platter with brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, green beans, and added a hot link.  The brisket was cooked properly and had a solid crust.  The fat was rendered just right and left the meat excellent.  The pulled pork was sort of hit or miss, but also had a solid crust.  Part of the pork was a bit dry, but the other part was juicy and fantastic.  Could have just been because it was late in the evening and it was a 20 minute drive back to the hotel for me.  The sausage was the typical andouille sausage found in lots of BBQ places.  The coleslaw was extra saucy, which I like, and delicious (try adding BBQ sauce to coleslaw sometime!).  The green beans were sort of rough - seemed like canned green beans just warmed up.  Fresh green beans with bacon, onions, and some seasoning would have been a welcome replacement.  The BBQ sauce was vinegary, Memphis style (no surprise there), verging on Carolina style.  Bigger portions than I expected.  Overall, nothing to complain about with the food.

The worst part about MJ's is the location.  I'm not a Phoenix local, but it sure seemed like a tough part of town.  There were a number of folks just walking in the middle of the street, staring at my car as I drove by, etc.  Everything was fine, but there were certainly no warm fuzzies to be had driving to their location.  It's also situated in kind of a weird place and you have to find a particular side road that leads you to their restaurant (although my GPS navigated me without issue).

So, overall, solid food, questionable location, AMAZING people.  If M & J can manage to find a new location, there will be nothing to stop them."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!! I'm glad I stopped to try! Clean restaurant friendly staff and fabulous food can't ask for anything better!!"}
{"text":"Who visits a legit BBQ joint and orders fried catfish?! I do. It was the spicy version. And it was also legit!

About a week ago, several of my co-workers wanted to send off one of our friends who got a new job. Someone in the group suggested MJ's. It's on the fringe of where we can eat and return within an hour, and I'm glad it is, because several of those in our group were already talking about returning.

It's an odd location due to the proximity of the intersection and the light rail, so consult the map before heading over. Once you find it, you'll be glad you did. Maybe it's because it was a Friday. Maybe it was something in the air. But everyone behind the counter was happy to be working and serving those lucky patrons who ventured in.

As I mentioned previously, while all my co-workers ordered pulled pork or brisket, I was drawn to the lunch special. Fried Catfish. I upgraded to the spicy version. I can summarize our lunch very simply. No complaints! And there are several other options I cannot wait to try. See ya soon MJ's!"}
{"text":"My rating is mainly for the food. They are really good, but I was blown away by the pricing of what I ordered, but I wanted to try it. $8.99 for 6 pc chicken wing? I loved the wings, I had the poppers, and the fish in the catfish sandwich was made to perfection, but they have to redesign some of their pricing to make it reasonable. $15.00 for 2 small appetizers is outrageous... I didn't want a bunch of food. Also I drove around for 20 mins before I found out how to get into the lot. On my 2nd visit I chose the 12 pc wings for a better deal. They were a bit soggy and not as good as the 6pc. This could have been due to the release of moisture from the number of wings in the container. Another reviewer complained about this too. They may want to change this by letting the wings sit a little longer before boxing them or cooking them on a higher setting to seal the water in a bit better. They were still ok, at least not as expensive."}
{"text":"Brisket Sandwich was delicious but the mac and cheese was the best I have had in a long time.  Owners were so friendly and helped us choose out meal.   Place is clean and all the customers were really friendly.  True neighborhood place.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical and trying this eating establishment. I was about to catch the rail until the gentleman who holds sign got my attention and referred me to this establishment. Upon entering, I smelled the true sensation of down-home barbecue and loved every minute of it. I placed my order with the friendly staff that works there he offered me several items up on the menu which I could not believe existed but they do. Such as spicy collard greens, peach cobbler,  mind you these items are homemade. My order was placed in a friendly and fashionable manner,  the food was (I'm trying to find a word besides excellent). Let's try unbelievable, the meat was falling off the bones literally and cooked to perfection. This is a must try you would not be disappointed at all!!!!! Moderately priced and well worth the money!!!!! Believe me I will be patronizing this establishment in days to come myself no more skepticism!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on a quick visit to the Phoenix area and yep had good reviews. They did not disappoint! The food was flavorful, meat Tender and smoked well. Also the owners  and staff were so friendly."}
{"text":"We stoped in after reading a review from Yelp.  Parking lot was completely empty on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  My heart  thumped.  Why isn't the parking lot at least, half full?  
We walked in and were greeted by THE most gracious host(he was about 6 years old) !  It was amazingly cute.  We were offered samples before we made a selection and all were delicious. 
I chose the Philly brisket, while my wife chose the wings with a spicy, tangy sauce.  Both were, phenomenal!  
They really do, \"Put the South, in your mouth!\""}
{"text":"I'm from the South so I was excited to try this place.  It is hard finding good catfish in the city until now!  My catfish, hush puppies, and green beans were delicious.  My husband got the lemon pepper and honey gold wings and they were really good too.  The chef was from Memphis and was such a nice guy.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was craving some ribs and did a quick Yelp search. This place was a little bit hard to find because of the one way street but totally worth it. I got the ribs and they were absolutely delicious. Thick-cut fries were good too.

Run by the owners. I've never had another man look me straight in the eye and tell me he's going to \"put the south in [my] mouth\" but I'll put that aside because of how good the food was lol."}
{"text":"We were starving after going to the Zoo...my son wanted bbq and I am so glad we found this place. Such friendly people and the food was so yummy! We got Nachos and 2 meat plate."}
{"text":"Great real BBQ! Recently moved here from Detroit & was having a hard time finding a good BBQ place. This place is it. The owners are from Memphis & boy can you tell. 
I had the 1/2 chicken with mac & cheese while my boyfriend had the beef ribs & fries. We both got very generous portions & the leftovers were just as good. 
Found our new go to BBQ spot."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great customer service. The team makes exceptional food. Good BBQ. Nachos enough for three. Great family friendly. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"So delicious! Tender brisket and tangy sauce! Love the mac and cheese and cole slaw! Great service and super friendly. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Traveling through the South West and came across this BBQ. The food is amazing, the service is delightful, and the location is clean. Would highly recommend to anyone in nearby."}
{"text":"Very friendly place, owners were great and so was the food.   Brisket was amazing and the mac & cheese was the best I have had in a long time.   Definitely home cookin.   If you are looking for a great BBQ place in the Phoenix area, MJ's won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I had to change my review this place is amazing. Can't stop coming here not only are the owners super friendly they are passionate about their food and service to their customers. The BBQ is amazing the fish is perfect everything I must say is good as hell. Can't wait til they move to their new location. I will be supporting these guys all the way. Small business in our community deserve our support we're supporting their families and their dreams. The left overs if you have them taste even better for the midnight snack or lunch the next day.. If you haven't been here I suggest you make the trip."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The best customer service I've had in Phoenix and the best BBQ. It's no wonder the owner is from Memphis!"}
{"text":"Most important first. I will be back for more of MJs. Going to start with a 4 star until I get a chance to try some more food.  I went with the brisket and mac n cheese.  Next time pulled pork and slaw, then will have to try wings, ribs or fish.  Off to a good start with the brisket and I could easily see this evolving into a 5 star after some more trips.  The beef is soft, smokey, not too lean, not too fatty.  Tasty bbq sauce and the mac and cheese is simple but addicting.  Parking lot was mostly empty for this upstart.  I hope they do well and are able to stick around for the long term.  It will be a great option for our Friday company lunches."}
{"text":"My people. 
Seriously.

The folks know what they are doing. I ordered a 3pc catfish meal to go (only 2 pcs made it out of parking lot lol!), along with slaw, greens and fried okra. And their hot sauce need to bottle that! 

I've eaten everywhere in the valley, and most place lose their love after a while. So... If you're looking for SERIOUS soul food, try anything or everything here. I know I will be!"}
{"text":"This place was the bomb.com. I ordered cat fish and it was amazing. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went for the fish, but I'll definitely be coming back for the barbeque.  The cashier was very friendly, and the prices are just right.  I had the 2 piece cod basket which came with a generous side of my choice ( I had potato salad) and 2 hush puppies.  The pieces of fish were huge and too hot to handle right away, which gave me plenty of time to enjoy the potato salad.  The potato salad was average, but the fish was superb.  The only downside is the location.  It is on the NE corner of Jefferson and 24th Street.  With the light rail, you have to make sure you are on the left side of the light rail or you will end up taking a detour.  There is also a large homeless population in the area.  Otherwise, I really hope this place survives so I can go back for more."}
{"text":"YUmmy bbq brisket.  Fast and friendly service.  Clean, large servimgs sizes,good prices. Came for lunch and it was quick."}
{"text":"There are three kinds of barbecue, yuck, good and hot damn. This one makes it to the hot damn category. I highly recommend the beef ribs and the rib tips and the chicken wings and the coleslaw. Since this is our second visit, everything else has been great too. Big problems, getting people to visit this out-of-the-way spot. Come on folks, don't let a good barbecue down."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday when we were expecting to go to our usual catfish place that is no longer there .  My husband and my self ordered the catfish and it was the best catfish we have ever had !! We have tried lots of restaurants that offer catfish and this is hands down the best !! The service was personal and awesome !!' My husband was offered a brisket sample and was so impressed that he ordered a pound to go and it was a very generous pound !!! 
   It's a small counter ordering eatery but customer service was so personal they even bring your food out to you along with all the condiments you need for fish and shrimp !!'
   We will definitely be going back here this will be our new BBQ and catfish spot !!"}
{"text":"You'll make a big mistake not coming here. Really great food, large portions, friendly staff. I'll definitely be putting the south in my mouth if I'm ever in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Got the brisket sandwich. Was not drowing in BBQ sauce which I appreciate. Great flavor, great texture, nice and soft. With onions and brioche. Nom nom. 

Although the food was great, the gents running the place try to really do what they can for you. They let me try a sample, very engaging and fun. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ brisket sandwich lunch special. Price was fair for the amount of food. Nothing fancy just a good ol BBQ joint! Brisket was tender and the sauce was unique and delicious. Met the owners and they were very nice and conversational! Go support this small business!"}
{"text":"I was looking to eat some chicken wings and opened Yelp and saw MJ's just opened up in the hood.  Super friendly service, both gentlemen running the spot were nice and friendly and let me sample some of there delicious brisket which was awesome (probably will order that on my next visit).

I ordered a 12 piece to go, and was able to choose (2) different flavors for the wings.  By the the time I got home the wings were still hot but a bit soggy.  It could of been the short drive home that made this happen, I might just have to eat them in the restaurant next go round to see if they are a bit more crispy when fresh.  The french fries I ordered were a good consistency nice and crispy, but we're bland and not seasoned.  This is a simple fix, quick dose of seasoning salt or just some salt would solve that problem immediately.  The coleslaw was unique, I enjoyed it.  I'll probably try the brisket or some ribs on my next visit.  I'm always willing to give a new restaurant another go, especially when the service is friendly.  I'll update my review after another visit or two."}
{"text":"Just had fish & chips, coleslaw, etc. delivered from MJ's.   So happy....the highest quality food that made for a great day off!   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of the old saying \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" 

MJ's is located on Jefferson St. just east of 24th St.  -- just north of the eat bound light rail.  But don't let that throw you. This place has some of the best brisket I've had in a long time. I'm from Texas, so I'm pretty particular about what constitutes good beef brisket and this place nails it! Tender, juicy, and flavorful!

I will definitely be back -- I hear their catfish is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"The food could have used sum seasoning , they have no plates ( not an option) you eat out of the containers the food is served in which is kinda weird. The fried brownie bites were really good. The owner M of M & J BBQ is an awesome  personality , the J of M & J BBQ  is the cook ...Maybe the M should be the cook, there might be a lil bit more soul in the taste of the food . Kinda taste like white people cooked this BBQ .  #Seasoningneeded."}
